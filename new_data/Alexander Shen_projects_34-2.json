[{"backer": "Alexander Shen", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Come manage a town in the West, they said. It\u2019ll be thrills, spills, and chills, they said. Well, friends, they weren\u2019t wrong. It has been that and more. But boy howdy, the disasters keep popping up! Almost as though someone is out to see your town fail and their town succeed!\nThe Roll and Write Revolution continues with Wild, Wild West! In this month\u2019s print-and-play game, we are taking you back to a more traditional roll and write experience for 1-6 players. Wild, Wild West uses just 4 six-sided dice, 1 sheet per player, and features simultaneous play - meaning everyone works from the same dice roll. It\u2019s excellent for remote play and playing on tablets! Watch out, though, Wild, Wild West has a few tricks (and traps) up its sleeve.\nWild, Wild West asks you to manage an old Western town with 6 areas of influence. Each turn players will be given dice to distribute around their town but not all of those dice will help you. From bringing in Varmints to luring bandits, it\u2019s a right cow poke in the eye! You can see some big successes, too, though! Just look at all that cash you can grab from selling watered down liquor at twice the price, or filling up a train for a sight-seeing ride! You\u2019ll even have the chance to round up some notorious wanted outlaws and put them behind bars where they belong! Get your head of cattle together, tell those varmints to scram, and let\u2019s have us a good ol' fashioned ho-down!\nClassic euro-style game play will force you stay sharp at keeping the disasters from building up too quickly. The trouble you'll find is that, with only so many turns and something going wrong every single turn, you can't do everything well. *Spoiler alert* The only way to succeed is to strategically fail (like falling with style). Pick and choose your battles well and you just may create a thriving boom town, after all. And afterwards, players are encouraged to look back over their town and share stories of their skillful mismanagement of certain areas. Does your town have a lot of high priced hooch and an ineffectual legal system? Do your future residents from the train feel safe knowing the Varmints have been rehomed? What about those outlaws, did you shut them down quickly with swift legal justice?\nDownload rules here\nBelow, Benny shows us how to play:\n This month we'd like to draw your attention to Rick and Courtnei Dendy's shop DetashEmporium. They run an interesting craft supply shop out of Gulf Shores, Alabama - lots of horn, bone, wood & resin blanks and even these really cool Old Western style dice and dominoes.\n Benny and I have a passion for gaming and would love to publish these games in a format that is both fulfilling and inexpensive. Offering the files for players to Print and Play (PNP) at home looks to be the perfect way to go! You don't even need a home printer. Since you'll have the PDFs, you can print at work, at a local print shop, or (like I often do) play straight on your iPad, Surface, or other tablet device.\n\n        PNP allows us:\nTo offer a low entry point into fun games produced on a frequent basis with no extra shipping costs or delays.\nThe freedom to design wild, wacky, and wonderful ideas regardless of typical commercial viability.\nThe opportunity to connect creative makers with a passionate community united by similar interests.\nHonest and responsive communication.\nDelivery immediately following the close of the campaign.\nA referral to at least one indie-maker in our community.\nMore projects just like this every month.\nAnd we\u2019d love to work with you designers out there!

Your favorite songs blasting through the speakers. Candy bar wrappers piled next to a warm drink in the cheap plastic cupholder. Your companion riding in the passenger seat, snapping pictures of landmarks as you settle into the hypnotic rhythm of the road. But be careful: this fun road trip could get dangerous as you drive through Death Valley.\n\nDeath Valley is a pocket-sized, push-your-luck, tableau building game for 1-2 players, with each traveler striving to assemble the best mix of cards in their Journey and Scrapbook in order to win the game.\nDeath Valley is 18 cards, packaged in a portable and durable wallet.\n\nEach turn, players will choose whether to assign a card to their Journey, or move cards from their Journey to their Scrapbook. Cards feature stars (points), special abilities (affect the value and position of cards), and some interesting facts about Death Valley.\n\nEach card also has a hazard (Heat, Terrain, Flood or Animals) listed. Having 3 of the same Hazard visible in their tableau will cause the player to bust and lose all the progress in their Journey.\nAll 4 hazards and their card distribution within the game.\nAt the end of the game the player with the most stars in their Journey, plus any additional points from card abilities, is the winner.\nTo set up the game, shuffle all 18 cards and place 1 face-up between the players. On a player\u2019s turn they have 3 choices: add the face-up or face-down card from the top of the deck to their own Journey, or Rest. When a player Rests, they move at least one card from their Journey to their Scrapbook (stacking them into a single pile if they select multiple cards) and shuffle as many of their remaining Journey cards into the deck as they choose.\nAfter the player takes their action for the turn, they check for Hazards among the visible cards in their Journey and Scrapbook. If they have 3 of the same Hazard type showing (3 Flood cards, for example) the player busts: 1 of the Hazard cards is removed from the game and the rest of the player\u2019s Journey cards get shuffled back into the deck.\nOnce there is only one card remaining in the center area, the game ends. Each player counts up the stars showing in their Journey row. Visible cards in the Journey and Scrapbook might have abilities that adjust that score. Once all effects have been applied, the player with the highest star count is the winner.\nBackseat Driver Variant\nIf you want to really press your luck and give up a little control, try out the Backseat Driver Variant. In this variant players may choose to play the face-up card on their opponent\u2019s journey as well as their own. At the end of each turn you will check to see if either player busts.\nSolo Mode - Designed by Kevin Ellenburg and Mike Mullins\nThe game will come with rules for solo play. Here you will face an AI explorer that thinks through its action each turn similarly to a player (playing the more intense Backseat Driver Variant). This explorer never rests in its pursuit of adventure.\nIf you would like to try the game yourself, the mostly black and white preview PNP is available at PNP Arcade now!\nhttps://www.pnparcade.com/products/death-valley-kickstarter-preview\nIn previous campaigns we created expansion material and used it as stretch goals. Since 2018, we've just given it away from the start. So no worries on whether we'll hit it or not, you are getting bonus content if you pledge here. The free expansion for this campaign is Death Valley: Panamint City.\nThis expansion consists of 6 more cards, letting you customize the deck before playing Death Valley. Before play, organize all the base game and expansion cards by hazard type. Then select 3 Animal, 4 Flood, 5 Terrain, and 6 Heat cards to shuffle into the deck. Unselected cards will not be used. Includes Vultures, Panamint City, Red Cathedral, Ubehebe Crater, Zabriskie Point, and Panamint Dunes.\nHere are the rewards available during this campaign.\n\nTo add more games to your order, you can do one of a few things:\nUS Backers only - to order games that ship now - go to our website http://www.buttonshygames.com and place an order using the coupon code \"0321us\" to get 15% off  of your order. Your website order will ship now, as long as you don't  order any pre-order items, otherwise the entire order will ship as  soon as everything comes in. As always, if you reach $25.00, you will  also receive free shipping. (NOTE: We previously offered a US Backer  code to combine games to save on shipping, but in most cases this was a  much better deal of free shipping AND 15% off.)\nInternational Backers only - go to our website http://www.buttonshygames.com and place an order using the coupon code \"0321international\" (REPEAT: THIS IS FOR BACKERS ONLY) to get free shipping on your extra game(s). Note: The limit on this  offer is 3 wallet games (and up to 3 expansions) total, including  anything that you order at Kickstarter. Anything above 3 wallet games  (and 3  expansions)  will end up bumping into the next shipping tier,  which can be as much as  $10 on international orders. These games will  all ship together with your Kickstarter rewards.\nThere are many notable games and we'll be featuring those throughout the campaign.\nWhile the game includes lots of great little historical facts about Death Valley, here's a little history about the game itself.\nDeath Valley was originally Kevin Ellenburg's entry to the 18 Card Challenge: Design A Game About A Real Life Location, and we\u2019re happy to see it coming to life. It has a unique take on the familiar push-your-luck mechanic where players have to think about managing their hazards as well as the card abilities, making each choice matter beyond the immediate threat of busting. On top of that, the gorgeous art from Fachri Maulana perfectly captures the lonely beauty of Death Valley National Park.\nFirst up is Kevin's initial pitch video in it's entirety (note some changes were made to the gameplay and cards throughout development):\nAnd here is the 18 Card Challenge video where it was a finalist, along with two other games that we eventually published, Skulls of Sedlec and Horreos. All 3 of which are available here. \n\n\nWe have an awesome following of repeat customers. As a result, we've built the Board Game of the Month Club.\nIt's a subscription service where you receive unreleased microgames,   promo cards, expansion content, and Kickstarter discounts ... every   month! Supporters also receive from $1 to $10 off EVERY WALLET GAME  that  we make. (Members back our Kickstarter projects at the $1 pledge  level  above.)\nOur 2021 $5+ packages include an episode of The Final Lightyear.\nGather your crew and gear and launch into a  fringe section of space where the law teeters over the edge and a good  captain can earn a living. There's no shortage of threats that endanger  the goodfolk of deep space, but luckily your torpedo bay is full and  lasers are hot.\nIn Lightyear you'll play solo or cooperative with a friend, as the  captain of a so-called starship, in hopes of earning some rewards and a  decent rep. Using tactical maneuvering and dice-based action selection,  you'll work through the sector's small, medium and large enemies trying  to gain rewards and ultimately live to see another day. Customizable  episodes will challenge you with variable enemies and threats while  offering powerful new gear and talented crew to help you in your  adventures.\nOur $10 packages include all of the above and something   extra. Generally it's a tiny game (up to 9 cards), or some expansion  / promo cards for our existing games.\nAnd our $20 package includes all of the above and a copy of   the featured wallet game (or the wallet game of your choice).   The featured wallet games also come with any expansion material that  is given away in the Kickstarter campaigns (like the Panamint City expansion  here).\nIf that sounds cool to you, check out the Board Game of the Month Club on Patreon!\nhttp://www.patreon.com/buttonshy\nThank you for checking out Death Valley!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWith our method of publishing and using multiple manufacturers, there's always a chance that one part of the game could come in with an error, leading to delays.

Your patrons are rowdy  and rude, but they are the only ones around. Your goal is to fill your inn with enough patrons to keep the debt collectors at bay, but to do so  you must manage some painfully particular, peculiar patrons.\nIn The Ugly Gryphon Inn, you\u2019ll be tasked with managing your patrons\u2019 various needs to ensure they all get a good night\u2019s rest. Each turn, you\u2019ll send one drowsy patron up to their room, then check to make sure all your patrons are sleeping soundly. If something\u2019s irking them, they might raise a fuss, so keep an eye on what they need as you go. Afterwards, you\u2019ll usher in more guests and keep an eye on the bar to make sure there\u2019s no trouble. There\u2019s never a moment to rest in The Ugly Gryphon Inn!\nA quick note on our Simply Solo line\nWe kicked off our Simply Solo line in May of 2020 with Food Chain Island. Ugly Gryphon Inn is the second in the series. Each game is designed by Scott Almes and focuses on games that are one player only, light on rules and big on replayability. \nAnd now, a look at Ugly Gryphon Inn\nThe Ugly Gryphon Inn offers the kinds of brain-stretching puzzle that Scott Almes brought to our first Simply Solo title, Food Chain Island. While they\u2019re both easy to dive into and endlessly replayable, here the focus is on managing each patron\u2019s needs while preparing for the next round of requests. \nCarefully booking your guests in the right order is key to success, as each patron\u2019s frustrations can have consequences for the sleepers below them. All the while, though, you\u2019ll have to expect the unexpected to make sure each new guest is comfortable. With a horde of disgruntled customers on their way, you\u2019ll have to be clever to run The Ugly Gryphon Inn.\n\nSimply shuffle the deck of patron cards and place them in a face-down stack in front of you. Draw 4 cards and arrange them in a face-up row in front of you. These patrons are considered to be at the bar.\nThe game takes place in a series of turns until you\u2019ve played all the cards from the deck and your hand. Each turn has the following flow:\nPhase I: Patron goes to sleep\nOne of the patrons at the bar are ready for bed. Select a card from the bar area and place it at the top of the inn. The inn is a single vertical line of cards, with each card being a floor.\nI choose to move the Sleepy Summoner into the Inn.\nCheck Rooms for Phase I irks. \nStarting with the Patron you just placed, you check each patron card from top to bottom. You check the statement on their card to see what will irk them and cause them to leave. If the conditions are met, then apply the effects on their card. \n\nPhase II: New Patron(s) Arrives\nAdds one more patron to the bar until you have 4. If there are no cards left in the draw deck, then this is the final round.\nI draw the Charitable Giant and add it to the Bar.\nCheck for Quirks\nEvaluate the quirk icons in the bar. If there are 3 or more of the same type of quirk, then you irk all the Inn patrons that are sensitive to that bad effect! \nIn the Bar there are 3 Fighting icons, which means anyone in the Inn that is irked by Fighting will trigger their effect.\nSince the Sleepy Summoner is not irked by fighting, her effect does not trigger. She'll stay in the Inn!\nGame End\nAfter you\u2019ve run out of cards in the deck, then count how many patrons you have in the inn. If you have 7 or more patrons in the inn - you\u2019ve won! If you have less than 7 or if at any point 8 patrons are in the discard pile, then you have lost the game.\n\nTry the game yourself!

So no worries on whether we'll hit it or not, you are getting bonus content if you pledge here. The free expansion for this campaign is Ugly Gryphon Inn: More Patrons.\n\nYou\u2019ve finally cleared out the bar and sent everyone off to bed...but what\u2019s that sound? A knock at the door, at this hour? Why, it\u2019s just what you need: MORE patrons jostling for a spot at your inn! It\u2019s gonna be a long night...\nThese expansion cards are shuffled into the starting deck, adding to the available Patrons found in the base game. You\u2019ll need to manage these new needy customers more carefully, as your inn will require one more contented patron to be considered successful.\nHere are the rewards available during this campaign. \n\n\nAs you may have noticed, we have a second expansion available! Here's a little more info on Ugly Gryphon Inn: Local Dragons:\n\nYou\u2019ve handled plenty of rowdy customers in your time, from monks and mages to giants and goblins, but there\u2019s one thing you\u2019ve never faced: the mighty Dragon. Now your humble inn has drawn the attention of an ancient wyrm. Pay close attention to who leaves and who stays: if your departing Patrons irritate the lurking Dragon, all your hard work is sure to go up in flames!\n\n\nEach game using the Local Dragons expansion adds 1 of 3 possible Dragons to your Inn. As Patrons leave, check their symbols to see whether they provoke the Dragon. If the Dragon is sufficiently provoked -- two matching symbols accumulated -- you\u2019ll lose the game.\nYou may have also noticed a new Food Chain Island expansion, Lost Beasts. This is the next in our line of expansions and is due to release in the next month or so here. It'll be initially available on our site for sale in small numbers, but if you are a Food Chain Island fan and want to combine it with your Kickstarter rewards to save a few dollars, we made a reward level here.  \nWe are waiting to see if Kickstarter approves any on-site add-ons for this campaign (it's still in a beta / invite only process), for the time being if you want to add more wallet games from our library (and we have a whole bunch!), we will do that in a different way.\nTo add more games to your order, you can do one of a few things:\nUS Backers only - to order games that ship now - go to our website http://www.buttonshygames.com and place an order using the coupon code \"1220impatient\" to get 15% off of your order.

As a result, we've built the Board Game of the Month Club.\nIt's a subscription service where you receive unreleased microgames,  promo cards, expansion content, and Kickstarter discounts ... every  month! Supporters also receive from $1 to $10 off EVERY WALLET GAME that  we make. (Members back our Kickstarter projects at the $1 pledge level  above.)\n\nOur 2020 $5 packages include an episode of Personal Space, a solo game that has multiplayer interactions. It's part roll and write, part campaign, part digital, part real life, part fantasy. There are stickers and everyone receives some unique cards and unique combinations  of cards. It's been live for a few months now, and it's our most ambitious project yet and it will emerge until Feb 2021.\n\nThen, we are starting up a new year long game in March. It's called Lightyear.\nGather your crew and gear and launch into a fringe section of space where the law teeters over the edge and a good captain can earn a living. There's no shortage of threats that endanger the goodfolk of deep space, but luckily your torpedo bay is full and lasers are hot.\nIn Lightyear you'll play solo or cooperative with a friend, as the captain of a so-called starship, in hopes of earning some rewards and a decent rep. Using tactical maneuvering and dice-based action selection, you'll work through the sector's small, medium and large enemies trying to gain rewards and ultimately live to see another day. Customizable episodes will challenge you with variable enemies and threats while offering powerful new gear and talented crew to help you in your adventures.\n\nOur $10 packages include all of the above and something  extra. Generally it's a tiny game (up to 9 cards), or some expansion  / promo cards for our existing games.\n\nAnd our $20 package includes all of the above and a copy of  the featured wallet game (or the wallet game of your choice).  The featured wallet games also come with any expansion material that is given away in the Kickstarter campaigns (like the Dragons expansion here).\n\nIf that sounds cool to you, check out the Board Game of the Month Club on Patreon!\nhttp://www.patreon.com/buttonshy\nThank you for checking out Ugly Gryphon Inn!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWith our method of publishing and using multiple manufacturers, there's always a chance that one part of the game could come in with an error, leading to delays. We've been able to minimize these errors in recent years, but they can happen from time to time. We've also upped our pre-press staff internally to make sure we can hit intended deadlines.\n\nWith COVID-19 some of our suppliers have been delayed, so we've been allowing additional time in our estimations and setting up backup suppliers as well. Our local staff is working while socially distancing, so we are allowing additional time for a smaller staff to assemble and ship games. \n\nOur two unfulfilled projects are moving along according to our updated schedule. Our Game Haul Bag project is shipping now.

It provides an easy entry point for those who are just beginning to code and sparks their interest in STEAM!\nXtron Pro is versatile with it's modular design. The core of Xtron Pro has a 4 pins connector which can be used to connect extension sensors and electronic modules with I2C buses, and a multifunctional magnetic pogo pin connector to connect game controller, robots, and lots more.\nLearn How to Program by Playing Games with Ovobot\u2019s Xtron Pro\n The Xtron Pro is a handheld console that utilizes MakeCode Arcade, allowing users to design games and other DIY projects.\n\nNot Just a Game Console\nXtron Pro is born out of the Xtron project. During the initial development phases, we received a lot of feedback from Xtron backers. Xtron is a bare circuit board, great for building up electronic hardware knowledge, however, it was not portable and the bare board can be easily damaged.  Since then, a Xtron upgrade came into being. We hoped it would be more compact, exquisite, and portable, and it could truly empower children's growth and learning, not just a programmable game console.\nEventually, this leads us to a clear goal, to make a multifunctional programmable mobile console for children - the Xtron Pro. With Xtron Pro, the user can define its functions through programming, run self-programmed games, customize smartwatches, and even build IoT and robot projects. We believe this approach will help to unleash the potential for children to let their imagination run wild. The Xtron Pro programmable game console is divided into two parts: the core and the game pad. We have also determined one core and multiple extensions R & D direction.\nRun MakeCode Arcade Games\nMakeCode Arcade is a code editor to build Retro Arcade games for the browser and handheld consoles.\narcade.makecode.com\nYou can build games by visual program language, Javascript or Python in MakeCode Arcade. During development, run and test your games within the simulator, then download them to Xtron Pro to play anywhere at anytime.\nXtron Pro is built in lots of hardware modules to enhance function to game programming.\n Design Games Directly on Xtron Pro \nWith the TileCode newly designed by Microsoft, you can even design, code, and play games directly on Xtron Pro.\nMagnetic Modular Design\nThe magnetic modular design makes programming more creative and playable. Rotating the core can switch between portrait and landscape mode, so you can build games in either orientation.\nThe pogo pin magnetic adsorption connection is convenient for assembly and disassembly, and it is more convenient and safer than any other plug-in connections.\nStore Multiple Games\nXtron Pro has a built-in 16 megabytes flash memory. On the basis of the origin bootloader, we added a file system to it, which makes it convienent to store, browse and load multiple game firmware.\nBrowse and load the new firmware\nTo upgrade your Xtron Pro, it's as simple as connecting your Xtron Pro to your computer with the USB-C cable to copy the new firmwares to the disk.\nAt present, most MakeCode Arcade compatible handheld consoles on the market can only store one firmware at a time and require a computer to upgrade the firmware. You will have a better experience with the built-in 16M flash memory and file system.\nBuilt-in High Accuracy IMU Sensor\nThe built-in IMU sensor with high accuracy leads to the fun of the game to go beyond the buttons. You can create motion sensing games with it, bringing a whole new level of interaction to the games you create.\nIn addition to be used for game control, IMU sensors can also be used to measure vibration, calculate angles, and count steps.\nMultiple Players\nHaving multiple Xtron Pros connected through data wires makes it possible to experience the joy of multiplayer games and online collaboration.\nOn top of your own games, Xtron pro also supports to run thousands of classic NES games. Such as Super Mario, Contra, Pac-Man, etc.\nIt's easy to transfer the Xtron Pro to a NES simulator, simply download NES games from internet and copy XTRON_NES.uf2 (developed by our team in Microsoft uf2 format which is the same as MakeCode Arcade Games) to Xtron Pro drive disk.\nXmaker Programming Platform\nWe have also developed a dedicated software platform for Xtron Pro, Xmaker. It has rich program blocks and image resources to make it easier for beginners with limited knowledge of programming. \nXmaker code editor for Xtron Pro, URL: xmaker.ovobot.cc(Beta)\nbased on MakeCode, we have added Xtron Pro-specific functions on the basis of Arcade, such as watch-related program blocks, IoT and speech recognition, etc.\nTurn Xtron Pro into a Smartwatch\nWe designed a trendy wristband for Xtron Pro, an arc-shaped silicone case, and adjustable watchband. With it, Xtron Pro instantly transforms a smartwatch.\nXtron Pro has a built-in high-precision clock chip and backup battery. Through programming, the clock interface of the watch can be customized to whatever design that you like.\nCreate a Pedometer\nWith built-in acceleration sensor, Xtron Pro can be used to create a step counter, you can customize your own motion detection device through programming.\nDIY a Countdown Timer\nCombining the accelerometer sensor and clock function, you can make a countdown timer to simulate an hourglass.\nWith the advent of 5G, the era of the IoT is getting closer, from smart homes to smart cities, from industrial IoT to smart agriculture, and the IoT has penetrated into every corner of our lives. The IoT as a system is a multi-disciplinary integration involving networking technology, sensor technology, automatic control technology and big data processing. It coincides with the STEM promoted in education. STEM education encourages the cultivation of multi-disciplinary comprehensive quality. Programming is a main axis of these comprehensive qualities, and a complex system can be realized through programming. XtronPro is a multifunctional mobile programming console specially designed for children. In addition to make games and wearable devices, it can also be used to develop IoT applications.\nBuilt-in Wi-Fi Module\nAfter connecting to the Wi-Fi network through your custom program, you can explore the rich networking functions of Xtron Pro.\nIoT MQTT Server\nThrough the MQTT server, Xtron Pro can establish connection with the mobile APP, so you can monitor the sensor data, or control the hardwares remotely.\nIoT APP\nThe Xtron Pro IoT APP supports data visualization of existing sensors and remote control of output modules.\nThe data endpoint in the APP is convenient to link up with visual program blocks, and the Xmaker provides a wealth of program blocks related to IoT applications.\nSensor Kit\nXtron Pro has a 4PIN connector, which can be connected to extension modules. We now have three sensor modules and three output modules, these include: ultrasonic, potentiometer and soil moisture sensor, servo controller, touch & led and 7-Segment display modules.\nThe existing sensors and modules are not very rich, we need your help to develop more modules to enrich the functions of Xtron Pro.\nSpeech Recognition\nWhen the Xtron Pro is connected to the Internet, it can recognize speech. The speech command can be customized through programming with provided APIs.\nYou can make IoT projects with Xtron Pro's sensors & modules and use Wi-Fi to connect to a cloud for speech control applications.\nText to Speech\nIn addition to recognizing speech, Xtron Pro can also convert text to speech. Why not DIY a dialogue robot?\nXtron Pro is a systematic project, it includes hardware, software, platform, server, App, as and courses. We have done our best to advance the development of the project with limited resources. Reaching the origin goal will help us continue completing the development. So far we have achieved phased success, the hardware is ready for mass production, and we have paid part of mold costs. After the funding is raised, we will use it to pay for the remaining mold costs, as well making mass production possible.\nXtron Pro has strong scalability. We have conceived a wealth of extension modules, such as lego extensions and robots. Our philosophy is one core multiple extensions. We have set a stretch goal at $100,000, if we reach this goal, we will gift one extension module in the Xtron Pro kit to encourage you to explore Xtron Pro's extensive features, and more colors will be unlocked.\nColor options\nBluetooth function\nWith Bluetooth, you can interact with Xtron Pro using your smartphone, or you can use your smartphone to program Xtron Pro in real time.

One player designs a hole by selecting and arranging a handful of board pieces.\n3. Taking turns, starting from the tee, choose a die and roll to see how far you go. You move forward whenever you beat your last number. You must move forward a space or follow any special symbols on the die!\n4. First to the hole wins, and all others score based on distance from the hole. Use Caddie Cards and Golfer abilities to get an edge on the way.\n Solo play\nJust like real golf, you can go out on the links on your own. Design your own holes and see how close to or below par you can reach, and even post your favorite course designs online! #rollinone\n\nWhy pledge?\n Get 10% off the MSRP | And shipped to you first, as backers.\n Exclusives | Get Golfer and Caddie cards available only through this campaign.\n Improvements | The more the Kickstarter raises, the more we can improve the quality and quantity of components in the game.\n This will only come to life with your assistance | Producing a board game is an expensive process, from the design to the manufacturing to the shipping, every step requires time, testing, and money.

Your objective as a deep-sea researcher is to guide your sub through fathoms of water, descending to the Trench floor, to find mysterious and amazing sea creatures.\nWill you become a renowned research scientist, or will you fall victim to the creatures that lurk beneath the surface?\nINTRODUCTION\nThe goal of The Mariana Trench is to score the most research points by researching deep-sea creatures and the floor of the trench. The game is played in alternating turns until your submarines run out of oxygen. \nMOVEMENT\nMovement from one card to the next represents a distance of 1000 Fathoms. At launch your sub can move up to 2000 fathoms (2 cards) on your turn. \nCOLLECTING RESEARCH AND UPGRADES\nWhen researching the water column, reveal the (research) card next to your sub. Each card displays a deep-sea creature and a submarine upgrade. \nYou may:\n\u2022 Collect the deep-sea creature, or\n\u2022 Upgrade your Submarine\nIf you do not collect the creature or upgrade your sub then leave the card face-up, where either player may collect it on a future turn.\nIf you have hold capacity you may tuck the research card under your sub (to the right), so that the class and size of the creature shows.\nIf you do not collect the sea creature then you can upgrade your sub. Tuck the card under your sub (to the left) so that the upgrade is showing. You cannot take the same upgrade twice.\nYour sub starts with a small hold, which can carry one small creature. To collect large creatures you must upgrade your hold first.  \n\nTHE TRENCH FLOOR\nEach time your sub reaches the trench floor you can conduct valuable scientific research. Take 1 research token from the supply and place it on your submarine. Your sub can only carry one research token at a time. The token is offloaded as soon as you surface beside the research vessel.  Research tokens are worth 2RP at the end of the game.\nRETURNING TO THE RESEARCH SHIP\nWhen your sub surfaces, all the creatures and tokens are offloaded to the research vessel. At the end of the game points are scored for different sets of creatures\nAnd there is more\u2026.\nOK, so we have the game, the expansion, and the play mat, we have a few awesome stretch goals to come too\u2026.

Now, out in the wild, you can find them butting heads to show off their wrestling skills and impress their insect friends  (We\u2019re not joking, it\u2019s a real thing).\nThis is the origin of the phenomenal World Insect Wrestling Championship. In Kabuto Sumo, you are one of the contending beetles, battling for supremacy in the ring and your place in the pantheon of legendary wrestlers.\nKabuto Sumo utilizes a slide/push mechanic not commonly seen in many board games.\nKabuto Sumo takes inspiration from those physical interaction games you know and love, but ups the ante with up to 16 playable wrestlers that add variable rules and uniquely shaped \"signature move\" pieces that are guaranteed to disrupt your expectations.\nIt\u2019s an exciting combination of physicality, strategy, and luck. \nYou\u2019re going to enjoy the components as much as the great gameplay.\nReal wood game pieces for every base game and expansion pack provide a satisfying bounce after falling off and hitting the table.\nLarge tarot cards (nearly 2x standard size) for the wrestlers show off the incredible artwork.\nEverything has been thoughtfully designed and crafted.\nThe box is a small size that will easily fit on your shelves or in your game bag.\n6.75 inches wide x 10.75 inches tall x 2.25 inches deep.\nAll of the expansion components will fit inside the base box too!\n\nPlaytested through hundreds of matches, every bit of Kabuto Sumo is guaranteed to provide exciting gameplay.\nKabuto Sumo isn't \"just a kids game\".\nYes, it is a game kids can play, but it is also 100% a game adults can play with each other. You can play with your kids, with your significant other, with friends, and your friend's kids. Each experience will be different and fun in its own way.\nA ton of effort has been put into the design to create special moves and unique physical interactions that can dramatically affect how you play the game.\nDuring setup, each player will pick their favorite color wrestler to represent them in the ring.\nYour opponent's wrestler piece is the ultimate one you want to knock out.\nWhen it's set up, get ready to rumble!\nConsider each wrestler's special abilities and signature moves!\nDepending on you've chosen to play as, you may perform their signature move before or after you slide a piece on the board. Each move may only be performed once per turn, at most.\nPlayers will have an idea of how the pieces will shift around when they push a traditional round disc against another disc piece, but be ready for anything to happen!\nThe signature move pieces with their special varying shapes, sizes, and weights will cause unique interactions that challenge your understanding of physics and create unusual outcomes.\nBy offering two ways to win Kabuto Sumo, players can adapt to changing conditions and play to their wrestler's strengths.\nKabuto Sumo brings together some of the toughest insects from around the world to compete in the ring.\nEach insect has a signature move with special advantages that connect to their real-life physiological features.\nRight now there are 6 base game beetle wrestlers and 6 expansion wrestlers that add non-beetle insects.\nIt\u2019s up to YOU to help reach the stretch goals that add 4 new characters to the game - 2 beetles for the base game and 2 insects for the expansion.\nUpdate: AllStretch Goal wrestlers unlocked! That's 8 wrestlers each for both the base game and expansion for a total of 16!\nThe base game includes a wide variety of beetles (that actually exist!) from across the world.\n\u201cMushi\u201d is Japanese for insect and \u201ckabuto\u201d is Japanese for helmet. This refers to the fact that this beetle\u2019s horns look like a samurai helmet. When he fights for dominance he will use his forked horn to lift the other beetle up and throw them into the air.\nStag Beetles are characterized by their huge antler-like mandibles. The head and jaws of this beetle alone can be as large as the rest of its body combined.\nTo ward off predators, Blister Beetles secrete cantharidin, a poisonous chemical that causes blistering to the skin. This chemical has many medicinal uses from removing warts to being the main ingredient in the folk remedy \u201cSpanish Fly\u201d.\nMale Hercules Beetles have a large thoracic horn that can extend up to 4 inches. They are named for their incredible strength and can carry at least 100 times their body mass in weight.\nBombardier Beetles shoot a hot noxious spray from their abdomen as a defense mechanism. An exothermic reaction created from the mixing of chemicals within the beetle heats the spray to nearly boiling.\n Desert Ironclad Beetles utilize a tried and true defense mechanism where they will feign being dead until they can safely escape from the predator.\nThe Titan Beetle is the largest known beetle, with a body that can reach up to 6.6 inches in length. Its strong jaws can snap a pencil in half or tear into human flesh. \nDung Beetles consume animal dung as a food source. To transport the dung back to their burrow, they usually roll the dung into a ball then push along the ground with its hind legs.\n\n\nTo keep the gameplay and character development fresh, the expansion pack introduces a wide variety of non-beetle insects.\nDenkimushi, meaning \u201celectric bug\u201d in Japanese, is the larval form of a moth common to Eastern Asia. The tiny hairs on the caterpillar cause a poisonous sting that feels similar to getting an electric shock.\nAn ambush predator that uses its long forelegs to grab hold of prey. They not only eat other insects but also small vertebrates like lizards, fish, and small birds. \n This centipede has 22 pairs of legs and on its head two sharp venomous claws known as forcipules. It will attempt to eat any animal smaller than itself.\nThese giant crickets are found only in New Zealand and can be some of the heaviest insects in the world, weighing up to 70 grams. They have enlarged spiny hind legs that they use for fighting.\n As the longest insect in the world, the stick insect's primary defense mechanism is its excellent camouflage, where it mimics leaves or branches to be almost unidentifiable.\nThe real Giant Forest Scorpion is the world\u2019s largest scorpion species, growing up to 9 inches in length. As its venom is not immediately deadly, this insect prefers to kill prey with its powerful claws.\nAs the world\u2019s largest hornet, it uses its enormous 1/4 inch stinger to inject potent venom. Multiple stings can even be deadly to humans, and has a history of terrorizing bee hives, which is how it earned the nickname \u201cMurder Hornet\u201d.\n\nThe female Jewel Wasp literally takes control of cockroaches. She stings the roach to make it docile, then she leads the roach back to her burrow. Once inside she lays her eggs on the roach, which will become food for the newly hatched larva.\nPlease note:\nThe game in the video is an unfinished prototype. The final product will have some improvements and changes.\nThis is a \u201cPreview\u201d, not a \u201cReview\u201d. That means this video is only meant to show what the gameplay is like. Any commentary is their own.\n\nPLAY\n\nChad saw Tony's early prototype for Kabuto Sumo on Twitter and immediately connected with both the theme and gameplay. It perfectly fit in with our love of quick but highly engaging tabletop games.\nThe self-proclaimed Purple People Meeter of the Warm Fuzzies Tribe (His words! We couldn't write anything that catchy.), Tony Miller is the designer of Kabuto Sumo. His son's love of coin-dozer arcade machines was the first inspiration for this game.\nHe's one half of the board game design team of Fire in the Library, and one third of the Breaking into Board Games podcast. He lives in the Portland, Oregon area with his family who inspires him to design games in between his Operations Engineer day job and the occasional nap.\nWe admit, although beetles and other insects can be pretty rad, they typically aren't the most glamorous. It was necessary for Kabuto Sumo to have an artist who could bring the unique personality of each insect wrestler to life.\n\n Kwanchai Moriya is an illustrator and painter with a degree in Illustration from the Art Center College of Design.\nA friend of Tony's, Kwanchai had a chance to play an early prototype of Kabuto Sumo at a convention. He felt a personal connection to its theme and was immediately delighted by the game. Once as a child, having spent a summer visiting his grandparents in rural Japan, he was given a wrestling beetle in a little plastic cage as a parting gift. Nothing could've been more exotic and fun, for a midwestern kid from the suburbs.\nTo make sure the game design maximized every bit of excitement and tension, we brought on John Brieger and Michael Dunsmore to playtest hundreds of matches, solidify the mechanics, and help us create the \"signature move\" pieces that cause truly unique and interesting interactions. \nBased in Sunnyvale, California, Brieger Development is an independent studio of boardgame developers specializing in helping publishers, licenseholders, and designers turn prototypes into marketable products.  Founded by former Apple Inc. designer John Brieger, they leverage deep knowledge on product development processes & design research to get games rigorously tested with a broad set of players.\n\n The base price is ONLY $29 right now!\nAfter the campaign, it will go up to $34 and the expansion will remain at $15. The game will not be in traditional distribution, but we will sell wholesale cases to brick-and-mortar stores who contact us directly.\n QE - Save the economy and buy out companies in this interactive auction game.\n On Tour - USA and Europe - Be the best tour manager and get your band to as many states or countries as possible in this roll-n-write game.\n Loot of Lima - Get the buried treasure before the other pirates in this deduction game.\n Bites - Snack your way to the top of the anthill in a commodity speculation game based on the Spiel des Jahres Recommended \"Big Points\".\n Three Small Games Set (GPS, Mountain Goats, Sequoia) - Designed to be crazy easy to teach and fast playing, these 10 minute games cram in a bunch of tension and thrills.\nPS: You can keep all these games closed tight with our four-way \"Game-Shut\" rubber bands that secure all four sides! The medium fits the standard box and the small is great for the small games.\nOur Premium Board Game Bag is a fan favorite. Designed specifically for board games, it can fit 7 \"Ticket to Ride\" sized boxes, is padded and water-resistant for protection, available in three colors, and offers 4 different carrying methods (horizontal + vertical handles, shoulder strap, and backpack straps).\nIt will carry your games to the finish line every time!\nIncrease your wrestler options 30% by unlocking 4 exciting wrestlers!\nThese are not just cosmetic upgrades either. Each stretch goal wrestler will further increase the enjoyment of Kabuto Sumo with a special signature move and corresponding signature move piece that add extra strategic elements to each game.\nAll stretch goals achieved!!\nHow it works: Simply share or retweet the EXACT posts we've linked. If there are over 400 combined shares, you'll get the following items in EVERY game!\nClick the link and share/retweet these posts:\nFacebook\nTwitter\nUpdate: Kabuto Sumo fans did it! Both the Junior Wrestling League and the reference tokens will be included in every game!\nKabuto Sumo has a surprising amount of strategy and for younger children, it can be tricky to figure out how to best use wrestler powers.\nThis stretch goal will add 5 Junior League cards to the base game AND another 5 to the expansion.\nThese cards feature existing wrestlers, but their signature moves are replaced by a simpler unique starting inventory that includes an awesome special signature piece.\nPS: It's also great for adults who may want something easy-to-play as the perfect end to an intense game night!\nAt the beginning of the campaign backer Ori Avtalion made this suggestion, and we thought it was a great idea.\nThe wrestler cardboard punch tokens will look identical to your wooden beetle piece and should help you remember who you are if you get knocked in the head a few too many times!\nAlthough wrestling beetles may seem like something we made up (we honestly had to check that this was real too) you can take it from Nat Geo that it is in fact, very real.\nLook at this champion beetle wrestling his opponent and throwing his spindly insect arms up into the air with joy after a hard-fought match! \n\nNote #1: Shipping will be collected in the pledge manager after the campaign. Do not add shipping to your pledge amount.\n\nNote #2: The Kabuto Sumo expansion ships free with your pledge for Kabuto Sumo.\nAnytime before your items ship, you may cancel your order for a full refund, no questions asked.\nAnd when you do get your items, if you don't think what you ordered lives up to expectations, we'll also refund you 100% and even pay for return shipping.\n\n\nBoardGameTables.com was founded in 2014 by Chad DeShon, a gamer who wanted a nice table for playing board games and figured other people might as well.\nNow, in addition to selling high quality custom board game tables, BoardGameTables.com also sells a less expensive, some-assembly-required, solid wood table called The Jasper Board Game Table.\nWe started selling board game bags for a similar reason. I needed something to carry my games in. No off-the-shelf options worked for me. They were too big, too small, or not protected enough.\nI published a board game calendar back in 2011 and it planted a seed of things to come.\nNow, 9 years later, we\u2019ve published 5 quick but deceptively strategic board games and 3 small \"super easy to play\" games.\nYou can find us on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our 5th major board game and we are confident we can deliver on time.

The countryside is blossoming and you are in charge of it all. The last team of planners couldn\u2019t cut it, so the farmers turned to your team, the best of the best. If anyone can turn this little farm into a flourishing ranching community, it\u2019s you!\nAgropolis is a standalone Sprawlopolis game. What does that mean? Well it's more of what we built with Sprawlopolis, but instead of more cities, it's farms. It adds a few new twists (livestock and feed fees), and can be played on its own or combined with Sprawlopolis in a fun new way. \nAgropolis will be the 66th game to join our growing line of Wallet Games\nA quick note on Sprawlopolis\nWe've made over 60 Wallet Games by now and it's safe to say that there's something really special about Sprawlopolis. It has been nominated for the Golden Geek Awards for Best Card Game and Best Solo Game, was voted #31 in the 1-Player Guild's People Choice Top 200 Solo Games, and has received the Dice Tower's Seal of Excellence.\nIt's been a wild ride.\nIt's gone on to have multiple sold out printings, and is currently available in many languages from our publishing partners from all over the world. Once again, a very special game and we are really excited to expand on it. \nAnd now, a look at Agropolis\nIn Agropolis, 1-4 players work together to build a new farm from the ground up. Using only 18 cards and a variable scoring system, the game is never the same twice. \nFirst, players will randomly flip over 3 cards to see the scoring rules for the game.\n\nIn this game, you will try to keep Pig Pens adjacent to your longest road, align your Orchards into specific polyomino shapes, and keep your Cornfields on the corners of the map.\nBut  not only do these 3 cards determine how you will score this game, they  also determine how you win. Total up the values of all three cards, and that number is the score that you need to reach in order to win.\n\nThe example above is just one of many, many combinations (816 to be  exact!). Each game has drastically different scoring rules in unique  combinations, and a new score to beat, ranging from 6 to 51 points.\n\nA look at half of the scoring conditions in Agropolis\nEach turn, players will play one card from their hand to the growing countryside, trying to score as many points as possible.\nPlayers will have to communicate and plan without revealing their own cards in order to most efficiently develop large areas in each of the 4 zone types.\nWatch out though, road maintenance isn't cheap and each road will cost you points in the end.\nNew to Agropolis are the three types of livestock pens, each in two different configurations.\nAnd finally there's the Feed Fee: a fun (and optional) new way to raise the goal just a little bit, making for a tougher game.\nWhen all cards have been placed, the game ends and players see if they have met the dynamically generated minimum score for their game.\nCan you meet the demands of the farmers, work with your fellow planners and build the ultimate agricultural wonder? It\u2019s time to find out!\n\nDownload the preview PNP today at PNPArcade.com!\nhttps://www.pnparcade.com/collections/new-games/products/agropolis\nWe'll start with a little coverage of the original game, Sprawlopolis. It's been out for 2 years now and has slowly built up a stable of great reviews and video content. Here are a few of note:\nAnd now for Agropolis. \nhttps://whatsericplaying.com/2020/09/28/agropolis/\nhttps://www.dastardlydesignco.com/post/agropolis-dastardly-review-135\nhttp://www.purplephoenixgames.com/agropolis-preview/\n\nIn previous campaigns we created expansion material and used it as stretch goals. Since 2018, we've just given it away from the start.  So no worries on whether we'll hit it or not, you are getting bonus content if you pledge here. The free expansion for this campaign is Combopolis. \n\nUse this expansion to create the perfect mix of city and farm zones in a single game. It adds 6 cards with scoring conditions relying on both Sprawlopolis and Agropolis, along with a few really interesting new rules (you'll draw one card from each game, choose one to play, and then discard the other). It unlocks an exciting world of new combinations!\nFor a look at the Combo game in action, here's How Lou Sees It, starting at 13:44. Feel free to watch the whole video as well. :)\nHere are the rewards available during this campaign.\nWe usually handle add-ons exclusively through our website, buttonshygames.com, but since Kickstarter has implemented a new add-on system, we are trying it out. \nIf you want to add any of the following to your rewards here, you can do it right in your Kickstarter pledge. It will ask you when checking out if you would like to add any items.

Note: The limit on this offer is 3  wallet games (and up to 3 expansions) total, including anything that you  order at Kickstarter. Anything above 3 wallet games (and 3 expansions)  will end up bumping into the next shipping tier, which can be as much as  $10 on international orders. These games will all ship together with  your Kickstarter rewards.\nThere are many notable games and we'll be featuring those throughout the campaign.\nWe have an awesome following of repeat customers. As a result, we've built the Board Game of the Month Club.\nIt's a subscription service where you receive unreleased microgames, promo cards, expansion content, and Kickstarter discounts ... every month! Supporters also receive from $1 to $10 off EVERY WALLET GAME that we make. (Members back our Kickstarter projects at the $1 pledge level above.)\nOur 2020 $5 packages include an episode of Personal Space, a solo game that has multiplayer interactions. It's part roll and write, part campaign, part digital, part real life, part fantasy. There are stickers and everyone receives some unique cards and unique combinations of cards. It's been live for a few months now, and it's our most ambitious project yet and it will emerge throughout the year.\nIt also includes Trolling For Trouble by Mike Mullins. In your first month you'll get the 6 card starter kit and then each month after you'll receive a card to expand the game. Trolling For Trouble is a 3+ player bluffing and negotiation game where you play the monsters luring the heroes into battle.\nOur $10 packages include all of the above and something  extra. Generally it's a tiny game (up to 9 cards), or some expansion / promo cards for our existing games.\nAnd our $20 package includes all of the above and a copy of  the featured wallet game (or the wallet game of your choice). The featured wallet games also come with any expansion material that is given away in the Kickstarter campaigns (like the combo expansion here).\nIf that sounds cool to you, check out the Board Game of the Month Club on Patreon!\nhttp://www.patreon.com/buttonshy\nThank you for checking out Agropolis!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWith our method of publishing and using multiple manufacturers, there's always a chance that one part of the game could come in with an error, leading to delays.

Its always been a dream of mine to bring a world like Masters of the Universe, Transformers, or TMNT to life. Mighty Maniax is being created in that same spirit.\nMighty Maniax Artwork by Ian Ameling\nThis is a new 3\" line of action figures inspired by vintage collectibles like, Battle Beasts, Army Ants, and Hasbro era WWF figures. Heavily influenced by video games and cartoons of the '80s and '90s, these characters represent a wild world of action, horror, and sci-fi fantasy. Johnny Tombstone is the main character and hero of the Mighty Maniax world. His supernatural abilities to sense evil and destroy it are unparalleled. Equipped with an Evo-cannon and containment pack, he sets out to balance the forces of good and evil with the most unlikely of companions.\nMighty Maniax Artwork by Megan Hutchison-Cates\nAmong his band of misfit monsters are Fishstik, a hyper-intelligent water creature, and Viper, a fast-talking Ninja by day; deadly Werewolf by night. Enter a world of frightening monsters and mighty heroes with the all new Mighty Maniax action figures.\nMighty Maniax Wave One\nToy molds are expensive! From a 12\" figure to these smaller 3\" figures, it takes a large amount of funding to get them made. We are looking to KickStarter backers to raise the funds to cover the molds and production for this creator-owned line of toys.\n1988 Lamborghini Countach Not Included.\nEach Mighty Maniax figure comes with 1 body, 3 character heads, and has 10 points of articulation. Swap the heads out to change up the look of each figure, or interchange any part to create new characters.\nMonster figures feature Maniac Morphing to change visual form from scales to fur, or even fire with different colors and heads. Get the Slasher Weapons Pack to add even more attitude to your figures. \nAll figures will feature the Glyos joint system. If you're new to Glyos, you may be wondering what that means. \nGlyos Size Chart (Left to Right: Toy Pizza, Battle Tribes, Mighty Maniax, Onell Design, Onell Design, and Spaced Out Design)\nThe Glyos System features a simple peg & socket joint system known as the \"Fit Function\" that makes them completely interchangeable with one another, allowing for limitless build options. Created by Onell Design, this unique joint system is only made available to Glyos approved toy makers. Rocom Toys has been working closely with Onell Design to ensure that Mighty Maniax figures fit right into the Glyos world while also maintaining their original voice and attitude.\nMixed parts Glyos build including Mighty Maniax, Toyfinity, and Onell Design pieces.\nWith Glyos joints, any of the toys shown above can share parts for new character creations. Its almost like LEGO for action figures!\nFor more insight into the world of Glyos, check out the detailed video above made by The Crafsman.\nPLAY\n\nGrowing up in the '90s wouldn't be the same without 16-Bit video games played on the Super Nintendo and Sega Genesis systems. When cinematographer, Joel Benner, and video-game coder, Matt Cooper, approached Rocom Toys with the opportunity to make a classic 16-Bit side-scroller, there was no question that it had to be for Mighty Maniax.\nMighty Maniax: The Video Game features 16-Bit Graphics With Modern Gameplay.\nWhat Rocom Toys created is an action-packed, spooky, shoot 'em up with a Contra meets Ghosts 'N Goblins vibe, all to the retro synthwave sounds of All The Damn Vampires. The music created for the game throws you right back into the '80s with the single \"Johnny's Revenge.\"\n\"Johnny's Revenge\" Album Artwork\nIn the single-level, downloadable-demo, you play as Johnny Tombstone. Travel through creepy graveyards, and haunted forests as you blast away waves of bats, monsters, and possessed tombstones! The ultimate dream is to eventually make an 8-level, full-length video game for the Nintendo Switch, or other consoles. The video game demo comes FREE with every reward including a Mighty Maniax figure.\nDeath Jaguar Add-On Accessories Stretch Goal\nRocom Toys started in 2018 after the success of the Death Jaguar Vinyl Toy Kickstarter. With hundreds of units sold, we began working with illustrators and artists to develop new toys that are unlike any other. Tom Neely's \"Henry & Glenn Forever\" Anime Robots, and last year's \"Future Me\" by Alex Pardee, both got vinyl toy treatments from their own successful Kickstarter campaigns. You can always check in on what we are up to on the Rocom Toys Instagram account @rocomtoys, or the new Mighty Maniax page @mightymaniax. This is our 4th toy campaign and we are hoping that, with your help, it will be another successful one! \nMutant Soldiers (Photo by Quang Le)\nThere are a few ways to back this project. Rewards range from a digital download of the Mighty Maniax theme song by All The Damn Vampires to a fully playable single-level demo of Mighty Maniax: The Video Game.\nExclusive Enamel Pin Designed by Tom Whalen\nEarly bird reward tiers will ship with an exclusive enamel pin designed by Tom Whalen! These are limited items and are only available while supplies last.\nTrading Card Artwork(From Left to Right) by Ben Templesmith, Johnny Ryan, Tyler Jacobs, and Patrick Gleason.\nSome incredible illustrators have lended their talents to create exclusive Mighty Maniax Artist Edition Trading Cards. Every figure purchased will come with a limited edition mystery card from one of the following artists: Tom Neely, Johnny Ryan, Ben Templesmith, Megan Hutchison Cates, Chloe Rice, Witchhaus, Christopher Ulrich, Bagger43, Tyler Jacobs, Kyle Wlodgya, Ian Ameling, Abraham Lopez, Megan Risk, Kelly Turnbull, or Patrick Gleason. \nPhoto by Quang Le\nMultiple figure purchases will come with multiple cards. Wave One rewards will ship with the full set of Artist Edition trading cards, and some backers will also have the option to add their name to the video game credits!

These include free add-ons that will come with Wave 1 rewards, new character mold reveals, all the way up to a full-length 8-level version of Mighty Maniax: The Video Game.

But, if we can share this project and raise enough money to cover the molds, then we can all enjoy some new figures in the Glyos universe! The risks are minimal once we have the funding to get the toys made. Onell design will be helping every step of the way to get these produced and ready for your collection.

Neoprene Playmats to make any flat surface a quality gaming table.\n2. Premium Bags for taking several options to game night with great style and protection.\n2. Lightweight Bags as a smaller sized option, meant for quick trips or a short night with friends.\n4. 2021 Weekly Desk Calendar with 53 beautiful board game photos taken by members of the community.\nThe Playmat is a premium play surface designed with the help of over a thousand gamers who participated in surveys and provided insightful feedback.\nWhether you're a casual or diehard gamer, there's no doubt this will elevate gaming experiences for you and your friends and family, at home or on the go.\nBased on survey data, it will come in two sizes:\n 3 x 5 ft (91 x 152 cm)\n 3.5 x 5.5 ft (107 x 168 cm)\nThe smaller size will fit on 75% of your tables and the larger size will fit on 45% of your tables. These two options should be a good balance between fitting on as many tables as possible, while giving you as much room to play as possible.\nAs an added bonus, the small size will fit in the play area of our affordable and available-for-purchase Jasper Board Game Table, and the large size is the same size as the Jasper's dining topper.\nExtra Thick Padding\n         Our premium Playmat is 5mm thick, a noticeable improvement over typical 3mm options. This makes it closer to a real gaming table feel designed to elevate your tactile experience. It's not just a pretty backdrop.\nInset Edge Stitching\n         The edge stitching really takes the Playmat from basic material to a fine product. We've also made sure the stitching has a lower profile than the rest of the mat, so it won't catch cards if they slide to the edge.  \nNo-Slip Rubber Backing\n         Few things are worse than a board sliding across the table and pieces falling to the floor. We've tested this. Trust us. The Playmat won't be sliding anywhere.\nEvery Playmat will come with a carrying case specifically designed for it. We want it to go with you to a friend's house, a community game night, a con, or a weekend getaway.\nI'm always a little skeptical of \"gift-with-purchase\" items companies use to increase interest, so it was important this wasn't just a cheap add-on. We've made sure the quality of the case matches the quality of the mat. The Playmat slides into the case easily and the adjustable straps make it comfortable to carry. We bet you'll end up using it even more than you think!\nWhy do I need a board game bag, you ask? We agree you could use a small grocery bag or precariously bungee-cord a big stack of games together - but wouldn't you and your games feel much safer with something made exclusively for them?\nWhen we first launched these bags, we had no idea just how much you'd love them and how important they'd be. From going over to a friend's house or even traveling (yes, this will happen again!), having a durable and padded bag has saved countless boxes getting lost or ruined and pieces exploding all over the floor or car. Now, with a bunch of real-life product testing, the Premium Bag is even better with upgraded shoulder straps and limited-edition colors.\nDurable water resistant exterior with reinforced seams \nRubber feet\nHeavy padding on all six sides\nMultiple compartments\nTough metal zippers \nSeveral options for different carrying methods\nDifferent situations (or hand cramps) call for different transport methods, so your new Premium or Standard bag is built for several options.  You can wear it as a backpack, secure it to your luggage, or carry it the good old fashioned way. The backpack straps even hide under the luggage handle slip so that everything is tucked away when you aren't using them.\nPremium Bag Bonus: A removable shoulder strap with heavy-duty metal parts and a padded strap.\nOne of the most popular requests  was to add more colors and we definitely agreed, so here they are: Ruby Red and Fern Green. These are limited edition colors so if you like them, now's the time to get them!\nPlease note, Heather Blue bags are not available in Europe for this campaign.\nYou're only as good as your weakest link, so they say. And whoever \"they\" are, they're probably right.\nWhich is why we're adding all metal parts to the Premium Bag. Now, the weight capacity has increased and you can be certain that you'll be able to carry any ambitious packing list.\nPlus, doesn't metal just look way better, and well, more premium?\nMetal parts!\nThe Premium and Standard Bags are both the same shape, but the main differences are the upgraded materials, colors, carrying options, and weight capacity.\n Fabric & Colors: Premium bags are made with a high-end soft-touch blue, red or green fabric. Standard Bags are made of a basic woven fabric and are only available in grey.\n Carrying Options: Premium bags offer a heavy-duty and removable shoulder strap. \n Weight Limits: Premium Bags are rated at 65 pounds for every carrying method while the Standard Bag handle is rated at 50 pounds for the handle and the backpack straps at 40 pounds.\n**Upgrade: The premium bags have been upgraded from our previous bags. They now have metal clasps and clips instead of plastic.** \n\"Chad really listened to his customers and his reviewers and went back to the drawing board and redesigned it and you can tell he is also a game player because he made the perfect game bag. Price point - perfect. The quality - for what it is, for what it does - it's a spot-on perfect.\"\nSometimes you don't need everything our Premium and Standard bags have to offer, so we're excited to launch a completely new and very affordable companion product, the Lightweight Bag.\nIt has the solid construction of our Premium and Standard offerings but is a bit smaller.\nFolds flat\nDual-layer water resistant fabric exterior\nWraparound handle straps to fully support game boxes\nI realized I needed this because grocery bags aren\u2019t built for games. The proportions aren't right for games to fit comfortably, no lid meant everything falling out in the car, there was no protection from light rain, and they weren\u2019t built for the weight.\nI also felt it wasn't quite appropriate to bring a big imposing bag when going to dinner with friends and they asked me to bring over \"just a couple of games\". \nPriced at only $6, its dollar-to-value ratio will definitely impress you!\nNote on weight limits: The Premium, Standard and Lightweight bag weight limits are based on factory testing. These bags are made for board games not for bricks, gold bars, or dirty laundry, so please use them responsibly. Weight limits also may vary depending on the weight distribution and how the bag is handled.\nOur 2020 Weekly-View Calendar was a huge hit (little did we know how many board games we'd actually end up playing) so we're bringing it back for 2021 with updated photos.\nThis is a feature-packed calendar that will include weekly gaming prompts, gamer profile cards, full year overview, 10x10 Challenge, weekly tracker, habit tracker, and space for notes.\nHave you seen some great board game photos that should be in the calendar? Recommend a specific photo (with link to original photo and/or photographer profile) in the comments section and we'll choose some photos to include! (assuming the photographer is on board).\nIt's basic business that if you're using someone's work, they should get paid. All photographers will be paid a royalty based on a percentage of calendar sales and will receive a free calendar. Each photo will say the name of both the photographer and game. \nAnytime before your items ship, you may cancel your order for a full refund, no questions asked.\nAnd when you do get your items, if you don't think what you ordered lives up to expectations, we'll also refund you 100% and even pay for return shipping.\nWe are quite confident you should receive your items by the end of December, before Christmas. There's also the possibility that, depending on your order, our inventory and fulfillment speed, you may receive your items as early as October (We'll caffeinate our elves and try our best!).\nNo additional duty or taxes will be due when your rewards are delivered to US, Canada, UK & European Union, and Australia locations.\nFriendly shipping means your package will ship from your own country or region. This is done to expedite delivery and eliminate taxes and fees.\nUS Friendly Shipping\nEU/UK Friendly Shipping (Will ship from Germany)\nAustralia Friendly Shipping\nCanada Friendly Shipping\nDo not manually increase your pledge amount to pay for the shipping now.\nShipping will be collected after the campaign in the Pledge Manager. You will get an email and an update from us after the campaign with instructions for the Pledge Manager. If you pay for shipping now, it will make things much more complicated during the Pledge Manager.\nBoardGameTables.com was founded in 2014 by me, Chad DeShon. I'm a gamer who wanted a nice table for playing board games and figured other people might as well.\nNow, in addition to selling high quality custom board game tables, BoardGameTables.com also sells a less expensive, some-assembly-required, solid wood table called The Jasper Board Game Table, and a line of quick but deceptively strategic board games.\nWe started selling board game bags for a similar reason. I needed something to carry my games in. No off-the-shelf options worked for me. They were too big, too small, or not protected enough.\nI published a board game calendar back in 2011, simply as a hobby, and sold 100. It was the first time I sold a product online, and it planted a seed of things to come; starting a business that would serve the board gaming community.  It's so rewarding to still be doing that.\nFirst: Choose the pledge level you want.\nSecond: If you want to buy lightweight bags or calendars, you will need to manually increase the price to pay for those.\nAdd $6 to your pledge for every lightweight bag.\nAdd $14 to your pledge for every calendar.\nYou can also add additional regular/premium bags or small/large playmats by adding $29/$46/$59/$69 to your pledge for each.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nEven though this Kickstarter consists of several different products, I am confident we can deliver them on time. Of course international shipping and COVID bring a certain amount of uncertainty to any project, but we have done our best to prepare and add extra padding to the schedule to account for this.\n\nAll the product designs are final (except we are still choosing some calendar photos, so send suggestions). The bags and calendars are made by factories we have used before.

It loves to explore the digital world around: radio protocols, access control systems, hardware, and more. The main idea behind the Flipper Zero is to combine all the research & penetration hardware tools that you could need on the go in a single case. Out of the box, Flipper is filled with features and skills, but also It's open-source and customizable, so you can extend its functionality in whatever way you like, along with the community.\nFlipper is made by makers who got tired of all these rough PCBs and bulky external modules. We want to make a versatile and beautiful platform for prototyping, hardware research, and pentest of any kind.    \nHardware with personality\nFlipper Zero is an electronic tool that has a curious character of a cyber dolphin who really loves to hack. The dolphin grows while you interact with digital systems in real life and he does it in his very own manner. Your actions will build his personality and he will always have fun and comment on them in his unique style.\nFlipper was inspired by the pwnagotchi project. However, unlike all the other DIY boards for hackers, it's designed with the convenience of everyday usage in mind. Flipper has a robust case, handy buttons and shape, and none of these dirty PCBs and scratchy pins. Flipper turns pentesting into a game, reminding you that researching always should be fun.\nBut don\u2019t relax \u2014 If you become flabby and lazy, Flipper will let you know. And oh boy, you better do not piss him off, as this cyber dolphinius will not stop until you please all of his hacking needs so keeping Flipper happy is a great challenge. However, despite his rough character, Flipper knows that the main goal in life is having fun and he will be your loyal partner in everyday hacking on the go.  \nFlipper becomes mad if you're lazy or ignore him\nTechnical Specification \nFlipper Zero is completely autonomous \u2014 it has a beefy battery, a handy 5-position directional pad, and a display. All the main functions and scripts are available from Flipper's menu, no computer or smartphone required. \nFor more control, Flipper is equipped with the USB Type-C port for upgrading the firmware, deploying virtual serial port, and emulating HID input device. We have also decided to build in a cool old-school LCD screen, and not fancy TFT / IPS / OLED because it's perfectly visible in sunlight and has an ultra-low 400nA power consumption with the backlight turned off. This allows Flipper Zero to be always on and ready with more than 7 days of battery life.\nTo communicate with the real world systems, Flipper Zero has a built-in radio module based on TI CC1101 chip. It supports both transmitting and receiving digital signals within the 300-928 MHz frequency range. This is the operating range for a wide class of devices and access control systems such as garage doors remotes, boom barriers, IoT sensors, and remote keyless systems.  \nBuilt-in radio module supports the most common IoT frequencies. Flipper also uses 433 MHz to communicate with other Flippers out there so you can make some cyber dolphin friends :)\nOut of the box, Flipper Zero can emulate remotes for popular garage doors and barriers. You can keep hundreds of remotes in Flipper's memory as well as create a blank remote for the new wireless gate. Just select the right brand of the system in the Flipper menu, register a new key in your garage/barrier receiver, and give it a unique name for easy navigation between your remotes. \nAs all the wireless protocols are software-defined in Flipper's open-source firmware, new ones will be added by developers in future updates. Out of the box, Flipper Zero will support PT-2240 and \u0420\u0422-2262 protocols (brands DoorHan, Came, Nice, GSN, AN-Motors and more)\nCustomizable radio platform\nCC1101 is well known universal transceiver designed for low-power wireless applications. And with a ready-to-use open-source library, developers can interact with the radio subsystem without limitations. You can write any wireless application, like custom protocol or decoder, as well as use it for connecting with IoT devices and access systems.\nSignal Analyzer\nFlipper Zero has an integrated decoder for popular remote control algorithms such as Keeloq and others, so you can analyze an unknown radio system to figure out the protocol under the hood.\nFurthermore, Flipper can record the samples of radio signals to analyze it later with more sophisticated tools on the computer, as well as replay the saved samples. Many remotes and IoT devices such as doorbells, sensors, and radio sockets don't use any encryption at all \u2014 in this case, Flipper can replay the signal, even if the protocol wasn't recognized.\nLow-frequency proximity cards are widely used in access control systems around the world. It's pretty dumb, keeps only a short few-byte ID, and has no authentication mechanism, allowing it to be easily read, cloned, and emulated by anyone. A 125 kHz antenna is located on the bottom of Flipper's body \u2014 it can read the EM-4100 and HID Prox cards, save them to the memory and emulate any of the saved cards by choosing one from the menu. \nRead, write and emulate 125kHz RFID cards\nYou can also emulate the card by entering its ID manually, so you can easily send it to your friend in a text format. Thus, Flipper owners can exchange card dumps with each other remotely without ever touching a physical card.    \nStore hundreds of card IDs in memory and emulate them when you need to\niButton contact keys\nFlipper Zero has a built-in 1-Wire pad to read iButton (DS1990A) keys, also known as TouchMemory or Dallas keys. This technology is quite old but still widely used around the world. It's based on 1-Wire protocol and doesn't have any authentication, so Flipper can easily read these keys, save IDs into the memory, write IDs to blank keys, and emulate the key itself.\nRead, write and emulate 1-Wire keys (Dallas Touch Memory)\nFlipper Zero has a unique contact pad design on the case edge \u2014 its shape works as a reader and simulator at the same time. The central pad of the iButton key is a data contact and the outer ring is a ground contact, so you need to lay the key in the correct position. The same contact pad can be used to simulate keys from the memory \u2014 just place Flipper to the system reader. This mode is also handy for silent interception of the 1-Wire data line.\nFlipper Zero can act as a fully functional U2F key, that works with any U2F-enabled services such as Google, Twitter, Facebook, Dropbox, LastPass, Amazon AWS, and many others.\nUniversal 2nd Factor (U2F) protocol is an open standard for hardware security tokens used for secure authentication. Developed by Google, Yubico, and NXP, U2F acts as a universal key that is designed to add another layer to the traditional login+password authentication method. \nEven if your password gets compromised, an attacker will not be able to log in to your account. This method is much stronger than the usual SMS 2nd-factor method, as it doesn\u2019t involve any third-parties like a cell phone operator. \nThe infrared transmitter can send any signal to control electronics such as TV, air conditioners, stereo systems, and others.\nBuilt-in infrared eye emulates any infrared remote\n Flipper contains a built-in library of common remote commands like switching on/off, changing volume or adjusting temperature, and so on. This library is constantly updated by Flipper community users that upload new signals to Flipper's IR remote database.\nInfrared learning feature\nAt the same time, the IR receiver can catch signals and save them to the memory, so you can store any of your personal remotes and transmit it later, as well as upload it to the public database to share with other Flipper users. \nCatch and save new infrared signals in memory\nFlipper's infrared eye can automatically detect baud rate, frequency, and modulation of the IR signals it captures without any configuration. That allows you to easily capture and store signals from all your remotes and other IR appliances.\nFlippers firmware is completely open-source. You will be able to find it on Github once the first units are shipped. This means anyone can extend Flipper Zero functionality by modifying the code and writing your own plugins.\nOne-click environment deployment for VSCode and Arduino IDE\nAll built-in hardware can be used in your programs, such as a built-in display to print text and draw images, buttons to navigate, radio module for Sub-1Ghz communication, RFID for proximity cards, IR for infrared applications, and GPIO for extending the functionality with your own modules. And thanks to handy and fully documented libraries, accessing all of those is fast and easy.\nSDK packages for all platforms\nReady-to-use development environment for all platforms\nDeploying a development environment for STM32 can be challenging. Therefore, to simplify this process, we will supply ready-to-use packages for Arduino and PlatformIO+VSCode IDEs, available for all platforms, no drivers required. Just install the package and you are ready to go. Uploading sketches is as easy as on the regular Arduino board.\nExtend with your own plugins\nFlipper Zero can run your code as a separate plugin without losing its own firmware, unlike other basic Arduino boards. Thus, you can run any specific code from the plugins menu without uploading it every time you need it. And don't be afraid to break something \u2014 you can always reboot to original firmware if your code freezes.\nRun your own programs from the plugins menu\nFlipper Zero can be used as a versatile tool for hardware hacking. Its 12 built-in GPIO pins are 5V tolerant and allow you to connect it to any piece of hardware while running your own code, controlling it with buttons and printing debug messages to the LCD display. \nYou can use it as a handy firmware flashing, debugging, and fuzzing device, as well as USB to UART/SPI/I2C/etc adapter connected to the PC. \nExtend with hardware modules\nWith the familiar header pins, Flipper allows third-party developers and makers to create their own compatible modules. Modules can be used to add new hardware features, interfaces, sensors, interface converters, wireless modules, and even a cellular modem.  We will share the mockup 3D model, so anyone can easily develop a mechanical design for their modules.\nExtend Flipper with hardware modules\nAs we all know, computers completely trust connected input devices like mouse and keyboard. Flipper Zero can emulate a USB slave device, allowing it to be recognized by the computer as a regular input device, such as HID keyboard or Ethernet adapter, just as USB Rubber Ducky. You can write your own keyboard payloads to type any key sequence, as well as fuzzing USB stack on a target device.\nVirtual HID keyboard injects keystrokes on a target PC\nWe realized long ago that 1 MB of STM32 flash is great to fit a firmware and all your plugins but might run out when it comes to additional data. There are lots of heavy data Flipper has to store: remotes codes, signal databases, dictionaries, image assets, logs and more. MicroSD slot always has been an obvious solution but we were not completely sure about the mechanics, so we didn't announce this before.\nToday we can finally confirm: every Flipper Zero will have a MicroSD slot.\nThe slot will be push-push, so the card will be reliably secured inside and will not protrude. Flipper Zero can work without a MicroSD card so it's not included. You can put any FAT32 formatted card in and store all the needed assets with no worrying that the memory will run out.\nSince Flipper Zero is a very resource-intensive project, not only from the hardware side, but also from the firmware side, we have identified some milestone features that we really want to implement, but can do it only if we have enough funding. These features get unlocked once the total pledged amount exceeds its respective goal.\nMore colors \nFlipper in a different case and display colors. Cool, huh?\nCase and display color options\n\nBluetooth module \nBluetooth module will allow you to interact with Flipper using your smartphone, as well as transfer interfaces like UART and SPI to your computer wirelessly. $300k and we are on the job.\nFlipper will be able to exchange data with smartphone and computer wirelessly\nNFC module \nWell, this is a big one. In the current version, Flipper is only capable of RFID at 125khz. The NFC standard (ISO-14443) operates at 13.56MHz. Adding this feature will require significant hardware changes and matching the two antennas on the same plane. If this gets unlocked, we are going to use the TI TRF7970A chip, the same chip as used in the HydraNFC project.\n\n3D-printed prototypes\n\"Flipper Zero is a very personal project for me. This is the tool I've always lacked. As a maker, I constantly have to build my own DIY tools. Usually, it's a bunch of rough PCBs with mess of wires on a breadboard. Here is my first attempt to build a beautiful DIY tool: Epoxy NFC Reader.\nThen, I tried to modify the original Tamagotchi with the RFID tag. I was inspired by Natalie Silvanovich's work on Tamagotchi modifications, Samy Kamkar's project  OpenSesame, HydraNFC, Proxamrk3 community, and personally thanks to Iceman. The last push for me was when I discovered the pwnagotchi project. At that moment I understood how my dream tool should look like. Feel free to contact me on Twitter.\"\n \"This is the first project where I was in the role of the Art Director. My goal was to create a character with a cute personality and cool, cybernetic appearance, that would have a little perky look. If you like how Flipper looks (and behaves), feel free to check out my portfolio and follow me on Twitter.\"\n\"At Design Heroes we designed, engineered, and manufactured more than 50 hardware products, but Flipper Zero was an especially challenging one. This time I worked tightly with Pavel from the very beginning of the project, covering all the stages from legal issues to marketing. \nThis is a new experience for me, and I\u2019m very excited and proud of what we have achieved so far. Feel free to drop me a line on business inquiries.\"\n\"I believe in open-source and I like that Flipper's firmware is open so the community can contribute to it. Flipper Zero is a very unique combination of a hardcore professional tool for hackers and a fun gadget for newbies who just started learning electronics. Check out my homepage and subscribe on Twitter\"\n \"My approach was to make Flipper feel like a professional hacking tool, a functional device with a modern industrial look that catches one\u2019s attention. Pavel wanted it to look futuristic and retro at the same time. I was inspired by cyberpunk medical equipment. Here is my portfolio.\"\n\"As a head of Mechanical Engineering, I am well experienced in designing products for mass production. I am responsible for ensuring that Flipper Zero is durable, long-lasting, easy to assemble & manufacture, as well as easy to maintain.\"\n\nShipping \nFlipper will be shipped worldwide.\nShipping will be charged via our pledge manager after the campaign, where you will also be able to confirm your rewards, address, and choose any add-ons. Please note, that our prices do not include local taxes, duties, and VAT, that will be subject to the laws and regulations of each individual country.\nPress Kit\nPress release, pictures, videos, and GIFs for press and blog articles. Link to Google Drive.\nFAQ\nThank you for all your questions and comments! We'll try to answer the most important ones here:\nWhat is the shipping price?\nShipping is worldwide. We will ask you to pay it separately closer to the date of the shipping on our website. Due to the coronavirus, the shipping prices are highly volatile right now, so we cannot accurately predict the exact delivery price. Even a few dollars of change can generate a massive risk for the project.\nFor now, we expect the prices to be 10-35$ depending on the shipping area. We are not making any money on it, and we will do our best to optimize the shipping process, so you get the lowest prices and fastest delivery times possible.\nHow about local taxes, duties, and VAT?\nOur prices do not include local taxes, duties, and VAT. That will be subject to the laws and regulations of each individual country, but we will do our best to minimize the additional costs.\nWhen will you ship?\nWe will receive the funds 14 days after the campaign ends, and then immediately kick off the tooling production. After that, we will run a few trial runs to be totally sure that the product is ready and reliable. If everything goes well, we\u2019ll start shipping in February 2021.\nIs this legal?\nOfficial firmware will not have any kind of potentially illegal features, such as jamming, brute force, etc. So Flipper Zero should be completely legal in all countries. Since its open-source, you can always implement any feature you want or use 3rd party firmware made by the community. In this case, all responsibility is on you.\nWill my Flipper have NFC and Bluetooth?\nYes, all the Flippers will have an NFC and Bluetooth. This does not depend on when you made your pledge.\nHow to choose the color? Can I add more Flippers to my pledge?\nAfter the campaign ends, we will share a link to our Pledge Manager website. There you will be able to choose the color, confirm your address, choose add-ons, as well as change your pledge quantity. So keep an eye on your inbox.\nI\u2019m a noob, how can I learn to use Flipper?\nWe will make a wiki, the knowledge base, and how-to tutorials. This will help beginners to get familiar with Flipper features, coding, and electronics development. But it will be also very useful for experienced users and help them to dig deep inside Flipper\u2019s brain \u2014 firmware architecture and electronics schematics.\nCan I join the development?\nTotally! We hope for your contribution from the very early stages.

At the same time, the game could still provide a LOT of replayability!\nPLAY\n\nThe game comes with 5 chapters. In each chapter, you will first read the prologue comic booklet, which presents the background story and gives instructions on how to set up the game. Each chapter has its own card pool, special setting/rules, and game goal.\nTo progress, you will reveal event cards one by one from the card stand and make choices. You will gain, lose, or exchange resources from your choices. The decisions you make may also trigger new events that will occur immediately or at a later time.\nWhen all the cards in the card stand are revealed, the \"Night Phase\" begins. You have to pay one energy token(or health point) to the time track as a time-counter. Shuffle the cards stored in the future zone and put them into the card stand. After that, another day begins.\n How to win? Game goals vary across chapters. In some chapters, you will need to gather a number of resources to win, while in other chapters, you will need to find the exit. Moreover, you will explore plenty of hidden goals that will also trigger a chapter\u2019s ending!\nWhenever you end a chapter with victory, you will read the corresponding ending comics to know more about how Eila goes through each stage. Reacting to your decisions, the story progress differently and will eventually lead to a different ending in chapter 5! \n What will make me lose the game? Two ways: Either you lose all your health points, or there are 7 time-counters on the time track. There are plenty of negative events and enemies in this adventure that can harm you. Think twice before you make any decision as you will always bear the consequences of your own actions.\n You can save the game between chapters by simply putting aside the habit cards, item cards, and support cards acquired throughout your journey. When you start another chapter, those cards will assist you, or even alter the future.\n Some elements such as combats, riddles, and movements on the map will be introduced one by one starting from Chapter 2. You will read the additional rules before exploring a new chapter!\nDownload\nRulebook v3.1 (English) PDF\nTry it free on Tabletopia! \nNote: The above rulebook is not the printed version.\nlink to BGG:\n https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/293207/eila-and-something-shiny  \nShipping will be charged after the campaign is completed through the pledge manager.

Portuguese, Greek, Italian, and more), after the campaign.\nPlaying with more than 2 players is also possible with Catapult Kingdoms, but you will need the core game and at least the Siege Expansion (included with the Deluxe Edition). There are two ways to do this:\na) Team Play\nIf you are 4 players, you can divide into 2 teams of 2 players each. Each time a team takes a turn, you can have one player choose and play the Action Card and one player choose and fire the weapon.The next turn you switch roles. This makes the game even more fun because you can collaborate and come up with more elaborate castle designs and game strategies!\nb) 3 or 4 players full support\nTo play a full game with 3 or 4 players you will need a second copy of the Core Game (if you also want to use the expansion you will need two copies of the Siege Expansion as well).\nTo play with 3 or 4 players, you set up like you see in the image below and apply the following rule: Every time a player is attacked (from any other player), they put the Distance Marker in front of their castle to mark the fact that they have already been attacked this round. NO other player can attack them as long as the marker is in front of their castle. At the beginning of the round, all Distance Markers are removed from in front of castles and returned back to their owners. If for any reason, when it is your time to use the weapon and you can not hit any other player (because everyone has a marker in front them), then you can draw two new Action Cards, keep one of them, and if you want you may immediately play a card (this means that you get to play two cards during your turn). \nAlternate Game Modes\nIn this game mode instead of each player building their own castle, you place the player boards in the middle of the floor and you build one big castle, placing all the troops in it (following all the Troop Placement rules).\nAfter the castle is ready, each player gets their weapons and sits about 1 meter away from the castle. Starting with the youngest player, you take turns throwing everything you got at the castle trying to gain points (every brick you knock out is worth 1 point, every troop 3 points). \nGame  ends the moment last troop has fallen. You then calculate your points to find the winner!\nAt the beginning of the game, each player receives one Royal Base. Place the base on any one of your troops. From now on, this troop is part of the Royal family and has the following special ability: During your Tactics Phase, you may move your Royal to a new valid location (per the Troop Placement rules) on your player board. This is a free action, no action card required.\nTo make the game even more interesting, you can play the Defend the Royal variation. This adds an extra ability to your Royal: During the Tactics Phase, if you Royal is not in play (because it was removed in the previous round and placed in the box), you may retrieve it from the box and place them in a valid location (per the Troop Placement rules) on your player board. This effectively means that the Royal will be the last troop removed.\n Kickstarter Preview by Tantrum House\nPlaythrough by Tanrtum House\nStella's Short and Sweet by Meeple University\n KS Preview by Game Vine\nCatapult Kingdom has many different expansions and add ons.

Payment will be collected via our pledge manager after the campaign. Shipping costs vary widely based on where you will receive your reward. Unfortunately, a one size fits all price isn't manageable.\nWe will pay to ship your rewards to our international distribution centers. Based on your delivery address, we will ship to you from one of the hubs below (subject to change):\nUK: GamesQuest\nAsia: VFI\nAustralia: Aetherworks\nCanada: Snakes & Lattes\nUSA: QuarterMaster\nGermany, Rest of Europe & Rest of the World: Happyshops\nBrexit:\nThe delivery time of the game is scheduled for January 2021. The shipping situation in the UK, due to its relationship with the EU, could change. Our goal is to bring the games into the EU and then find the best way to transfer them to the UK. We are monitoring the situation and will let you know as soon as we do, if UK shipping is affected.\nBrazilian Backers:\nWe are going to use VFI so we can give you a customs-friendly shipping solution. We understand that this might mean it will take longer to be fulfilled, but it ensures that there will be NO custom fees or surprise extra charges on your pledge.\nShipping Cost Estimates:\nThe following is a list of rough estimates for shipping of the basic pledge. Please keep in mind that these are just estimates, and costs may rise based on weight increases from unlocked stretch goals and any optional add-ons you choose. All prices are listed in US dollars.\nPlease note, Hawaii, Alaska, Puerto Rico and other remote states are not part of the USA category. They are included in the Rest of the World category.\nWe expect the shipping box for the Standard Edition to be 29 cm x 29 cm x 12 cm and weigh around 2.5 kilograms. The estimated shipping rates, which are based on these assumptions, can be seen in the table below.\nPICKUP LOCATIONS\nIf you are close to any of the following locations, you can choose to pick up your reward and not pay shipping costs!\nHalifax, Canada\n Vesuvius Media HQ: 38 Pioneer Ave, Halifax, Nova Scotia\n Cape & Cowl Collectibles: 622 Sackville Dr, Lower Sackville, Nova Scotia\nAthens, Greece\n \u039a\u03ac\u03b9\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1 \u03a0\u03b5\u03b9\u03c1\u03b1\u03b9\u03ac: \u0391\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c4\u03ad\u03bb\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2 11, 18535, \u03a0\u03b5\u03b9\u03c1\u03b1\u03b9\u03ac\u03c2 (\u03c4\u03b7\u03bb. 210 4296845)\n No Label X: \u039c\u03c0\u03cc\u03c4\u03b1\u03c3\u03b7 4, 106 82, \u0391\u03b8\u03ae\u03bd\u03b1\nThessaloniki, Greece\n Efantasy : \u039b\u03b5\u03c9\u03bd\u03af\u03b4\u03b1 \u0399\u03b1\u03c3\u03c9\u03bd\u03af\u03b4\u03bf\u03c5 13, 546 35, \u0398\u03b5\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd\u03af\u03ba\u03b7\nWe will ask you to specify the exact pick up location in the pledge manager after campaign.\nWe want to thank all of the backers who have been supporting us and helping us create and deliver great games. That is why we created a special Loyalty program.\nWhenever you select a pledge that has the Vesuvius Media Loyalty Credit item in it, you will receive a $5 Loyalty Credit for our next Kickstarter campaign. Loyalty Credit can be used to purchase add-ons.\nThis extra credit will be visible during the checkout process of the Hive Pledge Manager and you will be able to use it to buy add-ons (it can not be used for a main pledge nor for shipping costs).\nKeep in mind that the Loyalty Credit is per campaign and not per game. This means that if you backed us in only one campaign, even if you added all three games in a bundle, you will receive a $5 credit. We do this to be fair to backers who have paid more shipping costs by supporting us in multiple campaigns.\nIf you have Loyalty Credit from previous campaigns and choose not to use it in this one, then you will have an additional $5 for the next one.\nTo be eligible for the Loyalty Credit, you must pledge for a reward during this campaign. Late pledges and pledges of $1 will not qualify for any type of Loyalty Credit (credit from past campaigns or credit for future campaigns).\nVesuvius Media is a small (but mighty!), Canadian, indie development company. Starting off by producing online strategy games, Vesuvius Media has branched into new areas of production and currently boasts online games, mobile games, graphic novels and board games in its portfolio.\nWhat makes Vesuvius Media different from all the other companies? Vesuvius Media is community-driven. Whether online or on the table, its game designers and developers interact with players, listen, debate, and continually gather feedback.

In addition, some of the items shown might differ from the final product due to supplier/manufacturer error.\n\nMISSING/DAMAGED ITEMS\n\nWhen dealing with a large number of orders, there is always a chance that errors will occur. If after you receive your order, you find that there are items missing, please contact us at support [at] vesuviusmedia.com and we will send you the missing items as soon as possible.\n\nIf your package arrives damaged, please take a few photos of all damaged items and email them to us at support [at] vesuviusmedia.com. We will send you replacements for the damaged items as soon as possible.\n\nDELIVERY DATE\n\nOur current estimation for delivery is November 2020. We want your orders to be delivered on time as much as you do; however, history has shown that despite the best laid plans there is always a chance of delay.\n\nUNDELIVERED ITEMS\n\nIf a package is not delivered due to a backer's fault (wrong address given, backer didn't claim the delivered package from their post office, etc), the backer may be requested to pay additional shipping fees for the item to be sent out again.\n\nBACKER RESPONSIBILITY\n\nIt is your responsibility to check the Kickstarter campaign's updates and the private messages we send you. If a backer does not complete the Pledge Manager in time, then the shipping rates to send you the game at a later time will be a lot higher (because they will not be part of the mass shipping process). If the game can not be delivered because you did not fill out your shipping information and more than 6 months have passed after the deadline, there is a chance we will not be able to deliver you the game. At that point, you will not be entitled to a refund.\n\nDELIVERY ADDRESS\n\nAfter this campaign, you will be requested to complete a survey through which you can let us know which items you have ordered as well as where you would like us to ship your order. Keep in mind that your order may be shipped sooner or later than the estimated delivery date. Please give us an address that will surely not change (If for example you think that you may be moving to a new house around May, please give us the address of a friend or relative to ensure a successful delivery).\n\nSHIPPING\n\nPlease read the Shipping section above.\n\nORDER FULFILLMENT\n\nPlease note that your order may be delivered in multiple packages. This is done due to weight limitations for group shipments. Even though the items you ordered will be shipped at the same time, there is always a chance they will arrive to you several days apart. This may occur due to each country's postal service sort-and-dispatch system.\n\nUPDATES\n\nThrough this campaign you may receive updates about Vesuvius Media's other upcoming projects. Such updates will be rare.\n\nYou will also receive notifications about future projects. These notification will also be very rare and it will be very easy for you to opt-out with on click.\n\nBY PLACING A PLEDGE ON THIS CAMPAIGN, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ, UNDERSTAND AND ACCEPT THE RISKS & CHALLENGES STATED IN THIS SECTION.\n\nThank you very much,\n\nVesuvius Media Ltd.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 35 or more", "title": "Standard Edition", "descp": "Get a copy of Catapult Kingdoms and all applicable Stretch Goals.\n*Shipping charged after the campaign (see Shipping section for full details)\nINCLUDES:\nCatapult Kingdoms\nVesuvius Media Loyalty Credit\nApplicable Stretch Goals", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jan 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["208 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 60 or more", "title": "Deluxe Edition", "descp": "Get a copy of Catapult Kingdoms, a copy of the Siege Expansion, and all Stretch Goals.\n*Shipping charged after the campaign (see Shipping section for full details)\nINCLUDES:\nCatapult Kingdoms\nSiege Expansion\nVesuvius Media Loyalty Credit\nApplicable Stretch Goals", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jan 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["1,135 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 110 or more", "title": "2 Players ALL-IN", "descp": "Get a copy of Catapult Kingdoms, a copy of the Siege Expansion, a copy of the Artificer's Expansion, a copy of the Volcano Expansion, a copy of the Vikings Expansion and all Stretch Goals.\nThis pledge level is available only during the Kickstarter campaign.\n*Shipping charged after the campaign (see Shipping section for full details)\nINCLUDES:\nCatapult Kingdoms\nSiege Expansion\nArtificer's Tower Expansion\nVolcano Expansion\nVikings Expansion\n2\u00d7 Game Mats\nVesuvius Media Loyalty Credit\nAll Stretch Goals", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jan 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["1,614 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 120 or more", "title": "Retailer's Pledge", "descp": "A deposit of 4+ bundles of Catapult Kingdoms Deluxe Edition, exclusive to brick & mortar Retailers.\nThis is a deposit, not necessarily the full amount for this pledge level.

And I love dice!\u201d \u2014Ben M., Playtester\nIn the Dice Miner Kickstarter, everyone\u2019s working together to earn Gems that unlock stretch goals. Backers vote on which goals to work toward next. \nDue to the overwhelming response to the Dice Miner campaign, every stretch goal we planned to offer \u2014 and some that we didn't plan \u2014 has been unlocked. There is always the temptation, when a campaign is exceeding expectations, to pile on more and more stretch goals. We've reached the limit of what we think we can responsibly deliver, so we're drawing a happy line under what's been unlocked and get to work delivering on our promises.\nThank you, backers!\nThe Dice Miner backer pack is a collection of components and extras delivered only to Kickstarter backers. The exact contents of the backer pack depend on which stretch goals are unlocked, as decided by you, the backers. \nWhen bonus tunnel dice are unlocked, the ones you get in your backer pack will depend on which version of the game you're getting. Standard backers will get Standard Edition bonus dice, Deluxe backers will get Deluxe Edition bonus dice. \nBonus Goals\n\"Adventuring Party\" Play Mode: If six new heroes are unlocked, the \"Adventuring Party\" play mode will also be automatically unlocked, and provided to all backers as a digital download. In this mode, each player gets three heroes per game, and uses a different one in each round. This bonus goal has been unlocked!\nLiquid Courage Dice Game: If five tunnel dice are unlocked, a brand new dice game called Liquid Courage will also be automatically unlocked, and provided to all backers as a digital download. Created by our friends Sam Mitschke and Randy Scheunemann at Steve Jackson Games, we'll let Sam tell you more below. This bonus goal has been unlocked! \nMy co-designer, Randy Scheunemann, and I set out to create a variety of dice games that offer interesting choices and give players some control over how the game plays out. Yes, even the randomness of dice games can include meaningful choices!\nWe spent months working with this goal in mind, we designed a ton of different games, and then we ultimately narrowed it all down to 26 that we feel are the best of the bunch. Those games are all featured in our book, Random Fun Generator \u2014 A Collection of Dice Games, which will be offered in an upcoming Kickstarter campaign from Steve Jackson Games.\nOne of those games, Liquid Courage, was designed specifically for Atlas Games, with the awesome custom dice from Dice Miner in mind, and we hope you enjoy it! \n\u2014 Sam Mitschke / Chief Creative Officer / Steve Jackson Games \nWe'll alert Dice Miner backers about the Random Fun Generator Kickstarter when it goes  live, but you can also monitor dice.sjgames.com, where the book will feature prominently when it launches. We're extremely happy to feature Liquid Courage as a stretch goal for Dice Miner backers.\nLiquid Courage is best played with six tunnel dice per player, but we're unlocking it with the fifth backer pack tunnel die because backers can still play it easily by using the 27 tunnel dice form their copies of Dice Miner. If more tunnel die are added to the backer pack after the fifth one, so much the better.\nThe campaign mines Gems in four ways: basic, first day, social media, and challenges.\nBasic\nOne Dollar of Funding = 1 Gem\nOne Backer = 2 Gems\nFirst-Day\nOne First-Day Dollar = 3 Extra Gems*\nOne First-Day Backer = 5 Extra Gems*\n* First-day Gem rewards are over and above the \u201cbasic gems\u201d amount for dollars and backers.\nSocial Media\nOne New @AtlasGamesInsta Instagram Follower = 5 Gems\nOne New Atlas Games Facebook Page Like = 3 Gems\nOne New Atlas Games YouTube Subscriber = 3 Gems\nOne New @AtlasGames Twitter Follower = 2 Gem\n  Challenges\n Stream a Dwarfbook Live Video (Go live on Facebook, tell us why you\u2019re excited about dwarves, dice, or Dice Miner, and tag Atlas Games) = 50 Gems\n Mine for Dice on Instagram (Post an image on Instagram of dice you have discovered within or placed inside a hole of some kind, and tag #tabletop and @AtlasGamesInsta) = 35 Gems\n Subscribe to the Atlas Games mailing list for fans or retailers = 20 Gems\n Tweet Dwarves Love Dice (Tweet a photo including both a dwarf and a die, including a link to this Kickstarter and tagging @AtlasGames) = 25 Gems\n Cover Facebook in Glitter (Post a photo on Facebook showing off all your glittery dice, linking to this Kickstarter and tagging Atlas Games) = 20 Gems\n\nYou\u2019ll pay later for shipping. You keep more of your money longer, and shipping rates will be as close as possible to actual cost. Trust us, we won\u2019t make any money on shipping.\nRewards will ship from the Atlas Games warehouse in Duluth, Minnesota, USA. Based on our experience, this is more reliable and ultimately less expensive than a collection of global partners. In part due to our direct control of this facility, our shipping operations have remained both open and safe during the global pandemic.\nYou\u2019ll prepay taxes later. (Group pledges are an exception\u2014 see below.) This allows rewards traveling outside the US to be sent \u201cDelivery Duty Paid\u201d (DDP) where available, so international packages shouldn\u2019t be delayed at customs or flagged for extra fees. Backing Dice Miner on Kickstarter is not a useful way to avoid paying your local government\u2019s taxes.\nHere are the shipping, handling, and pre-paid taxes we anticipate by destination country. They are our best estimates, not guarantees.\nFor group pledge tiers, we will collect shipping and handling after the campaign. We will not charge for duties or taxes, nor pre-pay them, nor be involved in their administration or payment whatsoever. For group pledges, duties and taxes are the backer\u2019s responsibility.\nThis campaign will not ship rewards to Afghanistan, Brazil, Congo, Ivory Coast, Eritrea, Guinea-Bissau, Haiti, Iran, Iraq, Liberia, Libya, Myanmar, North Korea, Russia, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, or Ukraine.\nFrom the day we begin shipping, you\u2019ll have a year to complete your order and pay for shipping and taxes. Pledges unclaimed after a year will be assumed abandoned.\nRetail tier backers use Atlas Games\u2019 standard direct-to-retail sales terms for shipping. See \u201cStones & Mortar,\u201d below.\nAdd-ons will be available in the pledge management phase of the campaign. In addition to a variety of other Atlas Games titles, you\u2019ll be able to add the following.\nPunchboard Mountain \u2014 $8. Available to everyone, but intended mostly for Deluxe backers who would also like to have a punchboard mountain, in addition to a plastic mountain.\nDeluxe Dice Set \u2014 $18. Available to everyone, but intended mostly for Standard backers who prefer the look of the punchboard mountain to the look of the plastic mountain, but who dig fancy dice. (We understand that a Standard Edition pledge plus a deluxe dice set costs about the same as a Deluxe Edition pledge. It reflects what the dice cost, and the fact that you wind up with 120 dice instead of only 60.) Includes a Deluxe Edition dice bag.\nStandard Dice Set \u2014 $14. Available to everyone, added by popular demand. This is a full set of the sixty dice that come in the Standard Edition. Includes a Standard Edition dice bag.\nStandard-to-Deluxe Upgrade \u2014 $18. Available to backers at the \"Standard Group\" pledge level only. Each of these add-ons upgrades one of the five Standard Edition games that are part of that pledge level to a Deluxe Edition game. This allows the two editions to be be mixed among a group of gamers who are backing together.\nJosh DeBonis is the president of BumbleBear Games, where he designs arcade games.

Your pledge gives you dollar-for-dollar credit to buy whatever mix of Standard and Deluxe Editions are right for your store, at our standard discount (50%) and regular shipping terms.\n The price is the price. Our campaign offers the standard edition at $29 (MSRP: $29.95) and the Deluxe Edition at $49 (MSRP: $49.95). Our Kickstarter does not undercut long-term sales.\n Exclusive Deluxe Edition access. The Deluxe Edition of Dice Miner will not be made available through distribution.\n You\u2019ll get it before your competitors. Dice Miner\u2019s channel street date is January 15, 2021, but if all goes according to plan (not guaranteed, but likely), you\u2019ll receive your copies in early December and can sell them right away.\n Retail-only stretch goal. If 100 retail stores back Dice Miner, every one will receive a free demo copy of the Standard Edition.

We\u2019d call your attention especially to the backer updates for Magical Kitties Save the Day, to give you a sense of how we handle things and what we do when the unexpected arises. Past our previous Kickstarters, Atlas Games has been publishing tabletop games and making good on our promises for 30 years.\n\nAs a game, Dice Miner is complete. Its rules have been extensively tested, its components have been modeled, the art is all finished (with the exception of any new art required by unlocked stretch goals), and the graphic design is nearly done. We expect that Dice Miner will go to press before this campaign is over.\n\nAt the same time: Yes, indeed, many things seem very uncertain these days.

I grew up in the back woods, and muddy creeks here in Texas, within walking distance of where I lived. Though my love for nature never diminished when I grew up, the areas I loved so much changed greatly. Trash would dam up the creeks I loved to fish, particularly, plastic bottles, they were everywhere. It was horrible seeing the land I loved turned into a dump by inconsiderate people.\nI started cleaning up the area, but quickly realized this was not a sustainable method for me, I couldn't easily transport hundreds of trash bags through the bush, without them ripping open and all the contents going right back onto the ground. Then I remembered a trick I learned from my grandpa when I was a kid, was how you can take an old stump, and cut it in a way that it will hold a knife, and cut bottles and milk jugs into strips that he would use for different gardening tasks and jobs around the homestead. This allowed me to cut down the bottles and add them onto spools that i kept in the shed,  so not only was I able to clean the area up, but was able to turn it into a material we could use around the homestead ourselves, the only problem was they were so thick, and limited in their use because of that. This got me thinking as to how we could make the material the bottles created thinner, and more functional, as well as make a tool that can do it to fit into your pocket. This lead us, Grim Workshop  to create our cordage making tools, which processed bottles the same way, but are extremely compact, and portable. By doing this we realized not only did it make a functional material, while cleaning up one some of the most abundant waste product out there, but it would also give people incentive to pick up that waste, and turn it into something more than it was before.\nFrom Conception, prototyping, manufacturing, and materials all components used in this campaign,  are all made and sourced in the U.S.A. Grim Workshop prides itself on the fact that we produce, and source all of our materials here in the U.S.A. helping support other small businesses along the way.\nOur hope is that this campaign will help keep our creeks, and wilds more clean in places where people cant easily access to clean up, by providing such a functional material from the trash found in these locations. We hope this tool can help reduce plastic waste deposited into nature, and our landfills.\n                    Plastic Rope Making Card\nOur Plastic Rope Making card, also referred to simply as the \"Cordage Card\" is a credit card sized tool designed to turn wasted plastic bottles into a functional string that can be used for hundreds of tasks. This format is the easiest to use, as it is the largest version, it also fits inside a standard sized \"Mint tin\" as all of the Grim Workshop tools do, which is perfect for back packers and camping kits with extra tools, or to store some extra cordage you've made with it. The Cordage card also has a large hole for a carabiner attachment so you can hang it on the outside of a bag or attach it to other objects for easy use. The cordage card also comes with four holes, one in each corner so it can be secured to a flat surface and held still for additional ease of use.\nCordage Card\n\n              Plastic Rope Making Dog Tag\nThe Plastic Rope Making Dog Tag, AKA the Cordage Tag was designed to be an even more compact version of our cordage card. This tool was designed to be dog tag sized, so it could be worn on a necklace, for easy access and use, or it could be attached to a key-ring, as a mid-sized design, it combines both functionality, and portability. Each Cordage Tag comes with a ball-chain connector, and a silencer to go around the outside of it.  \nCordage Dog Tag\n\n            Plastic Rope Making Micro Tool\nThe Cordage Micro Tool was created to be the most compact tool of this sort that could be created. it gives you the ability to process bottles into cordage, and is smaller than a AAA battery. Combined with the convenient key-ring hole, and the metal clip included with it, and you've got an incredible tool, designed to go anywhere, and always be available.  Clip it to a backpack, or key-ring, and you've always got one at your fingertips. As this is the smallest possible design, it's also the most difficult to use.\nCordage Micro Tool\n                       Cordage Tool Bundle\nThe cordage tool bundle, comes with all three of our cordage tools, that way you've always got one available, stash one at home in a camping pack, or survival kit, one on a key-chain, and one on a backpack zipper so you've always got one on hand. The Cordage tool bundle comes at special reduced pricing even lower than the already low kickstarter pricing per tool. \nCordage Tool Bundle\n                             Replaceable blades\nThe blades on these tools are all replaceable, if they ever wear out, one awesome feature of these, is the fact that many common pencil sharpeners actually use the same blade as we do! This means in a pinch, its really easy to find a new blade, or you can always purchase replacement blades from us at www.grimworkshop.com \n                 Incredible Strength and Versitility\nAfter just a short period using this material, we found hundreds of different uses, but one of the things that impressed us the most, was how strong it was! How strong? One piece of the string from it could lift a cinderblock, one bottle could tow a ATV, and two bottles allowed us to tow an entire 3,000 lb Tractor! \nTowing a Tractor using two liter bottles\n                          Reduce Plastic Waste\nThis new tool from Grim Workshop not only creates an amazing material useful for hundreds of tasks, but it also helps keep the earth a little cleaner, and gives people incentive to go pick up trash bottles, and do something more with them! you can reduce hundreds of bottles to a single spool, where otherwise it would take dozens of full trash bags. The perfect tool in our opinion gives you something, and gives back as well. \n                      Want Additional Rewards? \nYou can easily add additional reward tiers, or items from our website www.grimworkshop.com to your pledge by adjusting your pledge amount to reflect these additional items you want.

Your goal is to influence the wildlife - and arrange their meals - so there is only one animal left!\nFood Chain Island is the next Button Shy Wallet Game, and the first in what we are calling our simply solo series. These are games that are one player only, light on rules, and big on replayability.  \nLet's get into what makes Food Chain Island so awesome!\nStart by shuffling the cards and making a 4X4 grid island of animals with the sea animals off to the side.  \nOn a turn, you must move one land animal one space in one of the four cardinal directions so it\u2019s placed over another animal that is 1-3 numbers lower in value. In this way, you can move the \u20188\u2019 animal over a 7, 6 or 5. \nWhen you do this, place the card on top of the lower card. This how an animal eats another animal.\nWhen cards are stacked on one another, they are considered to be the number on the top. The stack of cards now moves as one.\nWhen you move a card to eat another, you activate the ability on the card that just ate another. This special effect is mandatory and must be applied. In some cases, the ability will benefit you, and in others it will make the game harder.\nThe sea animals are there to help you out. At any time you may discard a sea animal and perform its special ability. Once a sea animal is used, it is discarded. \nThe game ends when only one animal remains or if you are unable to eat an adjacent animal. \nIf you only have one animal left, congratulations! You are an Ecological Expert.\nIf you have two animals left, nice job! You are an Accidental Matchmaker.\nIf you have three animals left, you just made it through! You are still an Island Intern. \nOtherwise, if you have 4+ animals, you have lost the game and need to keep trying.\nFurther Challenges\nTo make the game more difficult, randomly remove one or both of the sea animals. In addition, you can explore these alternate card layouts.\nYou can print and play the game today! The black and white version, along with unedited prototype rules is available at PNP Arcade.\nLINK: https://www.pnparcade.com/products/food-chain-island-kickstarter-preview\nFor a complete playthrough, check out Matt Upton's video below: \nMore to come as we update this image. :)\nAlso available here is Food Chain Island: Tough Skies, a three card expansion that will make your games just a little more challenging. At the beginning of the game, shuffle and place one card face-up into the play area. Do not use the others. During the game, you must activate, resolve and discard the air animal. The air animal must be resolved before the end of the game. For an additional challenge, use 2 or all 3 air animals.\n\n...\n-What's Eric Playing\nFULL REVIEW: https://whatsericplaying.com/2020/05/25/food-chain-island/\n-Hey Meepling\nFULL REVIEW: http://meepling.com/2020/05/22/food-chain-island-review-eat-your-way-to-the-top/\n-The Cardboard Hoard\nFULL REVIEW: https://www.punchboardmedia.com/home/2020/5/25/the-cardboard-hoard-initial-thoughts-on-food-chain-island\n-Boards and Bees\nFULL REVIEW: https://boardsandbees.wordpress.com/2020/05/22/0961/\n\n\nIn previous campaigns we created expansion material and used it as stretch goals.

Together as a team you must collect a certain number of gems, reach the exit and Escape, all before the temple collapses, and the game ends.\nEach player explores their temple by entering chambers and gaining bonus actions and gems for the whole team. The special colored chambers require players to work together. They must occupy both chambers of the same color, in the same round to unlock two gems at once. A daunting task but worth it!\nPlayers can select from different difficulty levels and variants to tailor the game to their group. Cooperation, communication, and a bit of luck rolling the dice is needed to gain the required number of gems and reach the exit before the time runs out.\nThe setup of the game is very easy. One adventure sheet is placed in the middle, and depending on the difficulty level, the goal on the gem track is marked. Each player takes a temple sheet, an adventurer, and a pen. A start player is determined and takes 8 dice. Then each player chooses a different direction from which they want to enter the temple. Done!\nGame round\nA round is played in clockwise direction beginning with the start player. The active player takes all uncursed dice, rolling them two at a time until all are rolled. After each roll they must decide if they want to keep the rolled symbols or place them in the common pool. But if a black mask is rolled, it is placed on the adventure sheet. These dice are cursed and locked from being rolled for three turns.\nThe active player's goal is to enter chambers on their temple sheet, collecting gems, and bonus actions. They can move their adventurer to adjacent chambers if they have the required symbols. In each chamber they gain the bonus depicted, which is then crossed out and transferred to the adventure sheet. \nOnce the active player has used all their dice, or cannot use any more, the other players divide the dice in the common pool among them. With these dice they try to fulfill the treasure maps on their temple sheet. A treasure map is complete if they cross out all the required symbols, gaining a gem, and a bonus action for the whole team that is recorded on the adventure sheet.\nThe adventure sheet keeps track of the collected gems, game rounds, bonus actions (available and used), as well as locked dice (black masks). Available bonus actions (a box with a circle) can be used by the active player to move around their temple. If an action is used it is then crossed out. \n Overview of the bonus actions: \nWhen players have collected the required number of gems, it is time to run for the exit in the center room of the temple. Everybody has to be in that chamber before the end of the final round in order to Escape!\nEscape Roll & Write offers lots of replay-ability with various difficulty levels to tackle, and two different temple/adventure layouts to explore! \nThe dice shrine chambers can be used with the Escape base game, offering additional challenges.  These chambers are exclusive to Queen Games.  They are available from this Kickstarter, and if there are any left in the production run, we will sell them at Fairs/Conventions, or via our webstore.  \nTo play with the new shrine chambers, 8 dice from the Roll & Write are required. Once a chamber is discovered two dice are rolled and placed on the shrines. Adventurers who enter the chamber can roll the needed icons to get either a gem, or one of 4 different special effects. The die is then removed to indicate it has been used. These chambers can also be played with any combination of expansions or Queenies.\nEscape Queenie Box: 11 - 16\nAll Queenies that were released after the Escape Big Box 2nd Edition in one convenient box!\n11 \u2013 The Cursed Gems\n12 \u2013 The Slide\n13 \u2013 The Map\n14 \u2013 The Wishing Well\n15 \u2013 New Quests\n16 \u2013 New Traps\nWith this and the Big Box, players will have everything that is available for Escape. \nThe Escape Queenie Box is also a great addition for players who only own the base game and want new modules to add to their adventures.\nQueenie 11: The Cursed Gems is already included in the Big Box, but is such a popular Queenie that we wanted to include it for all players to enjoy.\nQueenie 11: The Cursed Gems\nAdventurers beware! You are in possession of a cursed gem and must find the matching gem inside the temple, or you cannot escape. You and your fellow adventurers must search the temple for matching gems and get rid of them. This Queenie adds another challenging layer and is, therefore, for experienced players.\nQueenie 12: Slide\nThis Queenie comes with two chambers and a curse. The slide chamber is a tricky one, because you can enter it for free from the staircase side. But if you want to enter the chamber from the other side, you have to roll 3 torches. So you better be sure before using the slide too often.\nThe debris chamber is interesting since in order to discover this chamber a player not only has to roll two adventurer icons but also a key and a torch.\nAnd finally, the Cyclops curse makes you cover one of your eyes with your hand and leave it there until the curse is lifted. Sounds easy, but rolling with one hand and moving your adventurer with limited vision is very tricky!\nQueenie 13: Map\nThe map chamber is a great destination for players since it is one of the few chambers that actually help the players and make the escape a little bit easier. Inside the chamber a player can roll 2 torch icons and then place their adventurer in any chamber they want, allowing the player to quickly navigate the temple and help other players.\nQueenie 14: Wishing Well\nThis chamber also helps the players succeed. If you roll 2 key icons, you may either draw a treasure, get rid of a curse, or regain one of your lost dice! And you can use the wishing well multiple times... But only one wish at a time, so you have to leave the chamber and reenter if you want to use it more than once\nQueenie 15: New Quests\nNow players must fulfill quests, which are special chambers, where they have to work together to overcome a challenge, otherwise they cannot escape. Each game players can decide if they want to tackle one, two or even three quest chambers.\nQueenie 16: New Traps\nTrap chambers are especially nasty since the adventurer must be placed inside the chamber upon discovery. Now they are trapped until they figure a way out or another adventurer helps them. There are 3 trap chambers in this Queenie. How many are you prepared to handle in your next game?\nAdd-Ons \nFor backers who may have missed our recent campaigns or planned on getting the games at the Gen Con 2020 or Spiel 2020 (unfortunately neither of which will take place this year). We would like offer another opportunity to get Winter Kingdom here in this campaign, and Merlin Big Box, among others, in the pledge manager.\nPledging for this Campaign\nProduction for this campaign is planned for Q4  2020.  To ensure that shipping goes as smoothly as possible we are using Crowd Ox Pledge Manager.   \nEscape Base Game\nEscape: The Curse of the Temple is a real-time cooperative game in which all players must escape from a temple after awakening an ancient curse. The game plays in precisely 10 minutes, with an included soundtrack (also available digitally) counting down the game. Players must navigate through the temple by rolling dice and matching symbols to rooms, thereby gaining entry and visibility into adjacent rooms. The map of the temple will unfold as the players explore, making every game play different.  At certain points a countdown starts, and if players aren't back in the safe room when time is up, they will become \"lost\" and lose one of their dice. \nBig Box 2nd Edition\nMore content means more challenges to overcome. The Big Box includes the Base Game, 8 Expansion modules (originally released as three expansion boxes) and 10 Queenies (single expansion modules):\nModule 1: Curses\nModule 2: Treasures\nModule 3: Illusion chambers\nModule 4: Special chambers\nModule 5: Quest chambers\nModule 6: Characters\nModule 7: Trap chambers\nModule 8: Time chambers\nTen (10) Queenies. See the graphic for the names of each\nProduction and Delivery\nThe production of Escape Roll & Write as well as Escape Base Game and Escape Big Box 2nd Edition is planned for the end of October 2020. Our games are printed in Europe, so there is little delay between the end of printing and them arriving for fulfillment in our warehouse.

Easy and affordable, it ensures your plant journey is a success from the get-go. \n\nKnow Your Pico  \n\nAs seen on \nGrowing plants indoors around the year can be tough because they require lots of direct sunlight to thrive. Unfortunately, you can\u2019t carry sunlight around to make sure your plants get the energy they deserve.\nThanks to Pico's multi-spectrum LED grow lights, giving your plant enough light isn\u2019t a problem anymore; with it, you too can #GrowLikeaPro.\nPowered by high-performance power-efficient LEDs from OSRAM, Pico provides all the necessary wavelengths of light to replace the sun completely, and allow you to grow plants all year round.\nThese powerful LEDs are chosen to support a wide range of plants and each color wavelength stimulates a specific biological function in plants.\n The LEDs are mounted on an easily-adjustable telescopic arm\u2014because plants grow like crazy under our LEDs!      Reminiscent of a vintage radio antenna, it grows alongside your plants. As they extend upwards towards the light, extend Pico by up to a foot in height.\nPower Pico through any USB Type-C cable. Included with your Pico are 2 cables to get you started, a short double-ended USB-C and a 3 meter (10\u2019) super-long cable, along with magnetic organizer loops to help route the cable around fridges, windows or anything else magnetic. You may use any phone charger to power the Pico and the optional Pico-timer helps you automate it. \nThe Aluminum heatsink makes the LED module rigid and lightweight; it also helps the LED chips last longer through its excellent heat dissipation.   \nWith its USB Type-C ports on both sides, you can chain up to 3 Picos together with a regular phone charger. Or build yourself an indoor jungle with 6 Picos powered through a 5V 3A charger! Just connect cables to either side, and each Pico will accept and pass-through power to the next one.\n\nRegardless of how busy you are, Pico\u2019s watering system makes sure your plants have as much water as they need\u2014no more, no less\u2014to sustain their health and beauty. All you need to do is top-up once a week. \nWatering too little can kill your plants, but so can too much. Getting it right takes time and experience. Not many of us have it. With Pico, that\u2019s all taken care of for you!\nThe transparent window lets you know when it\u2019s time to top up, typically once a week. Employing just capillary action and gravity, this design does not require any power supply or involve a motor or pumps. Your plants will also grow quicker and healthier due to root oxygenation from below, provided by the ventilation holes.\nPlant pots take up space. They often can only be placed on flat surfaces by windows, which limits your options.\n With Pico, any place is a good place to grow some plants.\nWork desk? Check. Fridge? Check. Wall? Check. Glass window, bathroom or even in a vehicle? Check, Check, Check. \nAll 3 interchangeable mounts are included with your Pico.\nWhy several mounts?  Because when it comes to plants, you can't have too many and you might want them everywhere.\n\nAnywhere is a good place to grow!\nGrow anything you like \nNo seed pods or subscription is involved and hence no recurring costs! Choose any seeds or growing medium of your choice.\n\nPlants Make You Happy\nResearch has long suggested that indoor plants have a positive effect on the human mind and body. Studies show up to 60% reduction in depression, over 40% in anger, and just under 40% in anxiety. And at work, plants have increased the productivity of the office by up to 15%!\nPlants have been proven to improve motivation and concentration, increase energy levels and decrease fatigue. And thanks to the transpiration and evaporation of water from plants, they increase the air quality and improve eye strain and skin health, and reduce the spread of airborne diseases.\n\n\nFresh Herbs Right In Your Kitchen \nAlways wanted to have fresh edibles at hand? Imagine being able to throw your own homegrown, organic basil onto that bowl of pasta, or some fresh mint on your chicken. \nNo more runs to the store for that missing ingredient, having to wash the pesticides and chemicals off of your leafy greens.\nGrowing edible plants can be a challenge. And while the end result is often worth it, it is a commitment most people find difficult to make. With Pico, we made sure to get all variables just right, so you can grow your favorite herbs at home without a hassle.\n\nYes, it's tough choosing a color.\n\n\n Stretch Goals unlocked!!\n Pico tool design credits to Daksh Savla\n\nWhat\u2019s Included\nPico comes assembled and ready to grow. Just take it out of the box, add some soil and water, and a few of your favorite seeds. Plug it in and watch your plants thrive!   \n What\u2019s in the box\n 1X Pico (preassembled and ready to use)\n 1X Power cable (with magnetic cable organizer) (1 meter - 3' 3'')\n 1X Daisy Chain Cable (3 meters - 9' 10'')\n 3X Interchangeable mounts (magnetic, velcro, wall mount)\n\nWho we are?\n We're Altifarm Enverde, a startup based across the USA and India. We strive to offer a healthier and wholesome way of life to all. We believe in Your Right to Grow, Anywhere, Anytime.\nOur design team behind Pico\n Our first campaign was for Altifarm, which led us to switch from a Product Design studio into building home farming products. Altifarm is our flagship home farm with grow lights, greenhouse and mobility packs.\n Last year we launched Herbstation, a more sophisticated compact indoor farm. We've just completed fulfilment to our Kickstarter backers around the world.\nCompared to the other two, Pico is a tiny\u2014but only in size and not in ambition. Our goal with Pico is certainly big\u2014to bring as many people as possible into the fold of Urban Farming. Now anyone can connect with nature and #GrowlikeaPro!\nThis year, we took Pico to CES 2020. We were excited by all the attention\u2014no one could get enough of it!  \n\n Why Grow at home?  \nIs it possible for a Pico to grow enough to replace grocery shopping? Certainly not! \nWith our products Altifarm and Herbstation, we help people grow a substantial amount of fresh produce at home, with soil-based and soil-less methods. If anything, most items that are consumed fresh\u2014the ingredients for salads, smoothies, soup, garnish\u2014Altifarmers grow enough to meet a family's requirements when planned and rotated well\nWith Pico, our aim is to bring up the conversation around sustainable practices in food, and by participation, to have a greater appreciation for fresh produce among family members, including children. \nYou don't need fertilizers or pesticides when you grow your food at home\u2014no transportation, refrigeration, or even washing is required. And certainly, no single-use plastic packaging is involved.\n\n Timeline \nProduct Development \nFor business Inquiries: info@enverdeworld.com\nSay Hi to us: hello@enverdeworld.com \nPICO is fully managed by The Crowdfunding Formula (TCF), the biggest digital marketing team responsible for the top crowdfunding campaigns.

Click the button below to visit our website.\nYou can also sign up for our newsletter to get that latest on new gear and upcoming projects.\nDisclaimer:  We want to make it abundantly clear to everyone that Tortoise Gear is not affiliated with or endorsed in any way by Victorinox AG or their trademarked name Swiss Army.  The FireAnt is a patent pending aftermarket accessory designed by us for use with the Swiss Army knife.\nWhat is the FireAnt and why are we making it?\nEveryone loves a good Swiss Army knife - they are an icon of quality and utility wrapped up in a small and easy to carry package!  But let's face it, unless you're an alcoholic who only opens wine bottles with your Swiss Army knife, the corkscrew really is a tool with limited to no use.  Until now...\n The FireAnt is a custom sparking-steel fire starting tool designed to integrate with the corkscrew tool on Swiss Army knives. Every FireAnt will come with one Helix tinder. The FireAnt and Helix tinder transform the corkscrew into one of the most useful tools you can possibly have on a Swiss Army knife!   Oh, and you can keep your toothpick...\n The FireAnt adds firepower, a splash of color and glow to your Swiss Army knife instantly without any required modifications!\n A perfect micro fire starter for EDC! \nThe FireAnt is a complete fire starter integrated within the corkscrew so ZERO extra pocket bulk is added AND at less than one gram it weighs almost nothing, yet it's waterproof and can start hundreds of fires!\n Just say NO to bulky pockets!\nUnlike other fire starters FireAnt adds ZERO extra pocket bulk\nDesign Features.\nEvery feature of the FireAnt is carefully engineered to increase utility.\n Fluted design: the fluted design and adds surface area and angles to make the color and glow really stand out for a more visually striking appearance.\n Not your ordinary firesteel:  The FireAnt will use the same proprietary formula that we developed for our Firefly fire starters.  This is NOT your ordinary sparking steel, it is superior in every way!  It is easy to spark and anti corrosive and it has a lower hardness so it is much less brittle and puts far less wear on your knife tools.   \nLarge long-lasting sparks.\n Colors that GLOW:  We plan to make the FireAnt in three different neon color tops: Orange, Blue, and Yellow-Green, each with a color complimented sparking steel.  These colors are bright and can be spotted easily if the FireAnt is dropped. AND THEY GLOW!  Each color will have it's own unique all-night glow color so you can easily locate your knife at night!\nEasy to see, especially in low-light conditions.\n Anti-corrosion coating: The sparking steel on every FireAnt will be coated with it's own color complimented anti-corrosion coating.  This paired with a low corrosive steel makes the FireAnt very resistant to any corrosion.  If it gets wet or goes through the washing machine it's no big deal.\nCorrosion resistant coating\n\n Helix Tinder Included- Every FireAnt comes with one Helix Tinder.  Helix Tinder is a custom extruded waxed cotton tinder designed to integrate into the corkscrew with the FireAnt. \nHelix Tinder is waterproof and blended with special additives to increase the melt temperature so it won't melt in your pocket.  Helix Tinder also has a low flash point so it ignites easily even with very small sparks, this helps to prolong the life of your FireAnt fire starter.  \n One Helix Tinder can be used all at once for a large hot fire lasting up to 2 minutes or a small piece can be cut off preserving the rest for later.  When separated or cut into 4 pieces each piece can burn for up to 1 minute.    \nOne Helix Tinder pulled into four pieces.\n Helix Tinder is waterproof so it is a very effective fire starter even in very bad conditions.\nHelix Tinder is waterproof!\nThis is no gimmick, FireAnt means business!\nWet hands, wet tinder, wet fire starter, wet knife, wet ground, submerged gear, rain, snow, sleet... no problem.  The FireAnt and Helix Tinder combination just works! \nWe want to make sure everyone knows the FireAnt fire starter and tinder is a real survival tool that means business, check out this video.\nPLAY\n\n FireAnt makes a great accessory.  \nNot only does it work great, it looks great too!  The FireAnt can add a bright splash of color and luminescence to your EDC selection, and with three colors to choose from you can pick your complement of the day or activity.\nFireAnt is designed for everyone!\nThis is the most important section!\nYOU are how projects are successfully funded, amazing people like YOU kind enough to take the time to share this project with others.  Thank you! Just tap on your favorite social platform icon(s) and share, it's that easy!\nRewards.\nJust click on the reward you want from the column at the right, enter the pledge amount and hit continue.\nIf you want more you can add that to your pledge amount.\nFor example: If you want the FireAnt 6 pack Early Delivery reward, but you also want a FireAnt 3 Pack reward, just select the FireAnt 6 Pack Early Delivery reward and add in the additional amount of the FireAnt 3 Pack. You can tell us exactly what you pledged for once we send out your backer survey after the campaign is over and it will ship with your earliest reward selection shipment time.\nStretch Goal: $50,000  | UNLOCKED!\nIf we meet or exceed the $50,000 goal:\n Pledges of $24 and up will receive 1 free Kickstarter exclusive color FireAnt with a Helix Tinder. \nPledges of $40 and up will receive 2 free Kickstarter exclusive color FireAnts with Helix Tinder.\nPledges of $75 and up will receive 3 free Kickstarter exclusive color FireAnts with Helix Tinder, AND have the option to choose as many of the exclusive Kickstarter color FireAnts as they want as one of their reward color choices\n\n\n What knives and tools will FireAnt work with? \nFireAnt will work with any modern Victorinox brand Swiss Army knife that has a smooth corkscrew tool.  Older style corkscrews have a groove running down along them, most of these will work too, but there are some that won't, especially if they are bent at all or have extra turns (really old ones). \nWe recommend using a knife model that has either a wood saw, metal saw (file), scissors, or an awl as these four tools work the best, but the FireAnt will work with any of these pictured tools:\nI already have a Firefly, why would I want a FireAnt too?\nThe Firefly (our previous project) and the FireAnt both have their place.  Here is a comparison of each and the reasons why you might want one or the other or both:\nFireAnt-\nAdvantages over the Firefly \nYou get to keep your toothpick.\nMore visually useful and appealing.  With a larger top it has color and glow brightness that are much better compared to the Firefly.  This makes it more visually appealing as an accessory and much easier to find at night.\nThe FireAnt comes in three color choices as compared with only two Firefly colors.\nEvery FireAnt comes with a complimentary piece of Helix Tinder.\nComes with special anti-corrosion coating for added protection from the elements.\nBecause of the shorter sparking steel the FireAnt is much more difficult to accidentally break compared to the Firefly.\nLess expensive.\nFirefly - \nAdvantages over the FireAnt:\nThe Firefly has a much larger sparking steel than the FireAnt.  The larger sparking steel makes it easier to get really good sparks which are necessary for starting fires with larger tinder like coarse grass or new dry leaves.\nThe Firefly has the potential to last longer because it has a much larger sparking steel.\nThe Firefly is more versatile.  The Firefly will fit into any Swiss Army knife with a toothpick slot, which is found in most models.  Even the smaller Classic key chain size knives will accept a Firefly Mini.  It is not restricted only to corkscrew models.\nThe Firefly doesn't take up any space in the corkscrew so you can carry a significantly larger amount of Helix Tinder in the corkscrew to use with the the Firefly if you have a knife with a corkscrew.  (Larger size Helix tinder made for the Firefly will be available after the FireAnt campaign if it is successful) \nRedundance is key in a survival situation and you can put different fire starters in different knives so we of course recommend getting both :)\nPledge With Confidence!\nWe will ALWAYS Deliver!\nWe don't just create projects on kickstarter, we help fund them too, and we know how frustrating it is to pledge for a project that never gets done.  We will NEVER do that to our valued backers!  If for some reason we cannot produce the product you pledged for we will send you a FULL refund guaranteed!\nWe have great respect for the integrity of Kickstarter and for the opportunity it and the amazing community of backers has provided and continues to provide for entrepreneurs like us.\nIf you help us reach our funding goal we WILL finish the project and ship your reward to you PERIOD.\nTimeline.\n2009 - Idea.\n2017 - Firefly project.

We've got experience and grit! \n\nWe have completed and delivered on two previous successful Kickstarter campaigns with thousands of happy customers around the world and we have learned some good lessons along the road. \n\nOur first project, SOL Water, was a success, and it taught us a great deal more about manufacturing than we knew before we started that campaign. SOL Water was a very complex project. We were able to develop and produce a new design of plastic, make 3 different complex production lines of tooling, design and manufacture several injection molded parts, ship all of our product to our warehouse from overseas, and deliver all of the rewards to our backers, all on a very tight budget. So, we've been around the block. You can check out the amazing SOL Water project and a link to purchase the product here and click the \"Available Now\" button if you'd like to purchase now for immediate delivery: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/740457940/sol-water-hydration-powered-by-the-sun\n\nOur second project, the Firefly, was even more successful with over 3,000 amazing backers! We really had fun with this one, but it also created a new logistics challenge of getting out a large number of packages to backers in every continent of the world in a timely manner. This time around though we had learned from our previous project and had most of the technical and logistics work and trials done before we even started the campaign which greatly reduced possible production delays and we were able to deliver a great product in full retail packaging to our large number of backers in a timely manner. Check out the game changing Firefly project here and click the \"Available Now\" button if you'd like to purchase now for immediate delivery: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/fireant/firefly-the-ultimate-swiss-army-knife-accessory/description\n \nWith this current FireAnt project we have done all of the leg work, trials, testing, and even prototype tooling testing before starting this campaign. Our sparking steel formula has already been perfected and tested with the Firefly project. Our manufacturing partners are standing by ready to make full production tooling and rapid FireAnt manufacturing pending delivery of funds. We are confident that if this campaign successfully meets its funding goal FireAnt backers will get a great product without delays!

All games have been created along Italian authors and the illustrators that you have already seen in our previous titles. Each game has its own identity and the boxes are as small as 12x8 cm. You can carry them with you, slide the matchbox and play in just 20 minutes with cards and small bits that will make the whole experience so satisfying!\nNatural phenomena have had an odd behaviour lately, seasons seem to have been disrupted and animals are migrating in the wrong direction. The 24 East Asian traditional solar terms are out of sync. Your seasons must find their alignment so the sun can find its route again and set the order right among all living things.\nIn 15 days, players will take alternating turns. Each turn choose 2 out of 4 possible actions, trying to receive the  animals pawns for special abilities and completing sets of Season cards for the most points at the end of the game.\nMenace is approaching you. There seems to be a way out, but as a Samurai your first move is to reach for your weapons. Your basic instincts to run and hide have dissolved since the only option left is to fight for your honour. You are a rock and will hold tight, fighting the opponents face to face, using your weapons until the the very end.\nEiyo is a fast paced game where you need to strategically manage your weapons to defeat hordes of enemies. You will need to survive the attacks while gaining honour points that will be crucial at the end of the game.\nAfter relentless days spent diluting solvents and heating liquid mixtures in vials, the air is damp, while the old and overused books stored in the library of your laboratory smell of humidity and dust. The end of the day is approaching and you have just found the perfect transmutation. You decide to stay a little longer, but you know the candles will stay on until they consume completely.\nRebis is a 1\u20134 player game. To win, you have to play your alchemistic ingredients wisely in order to brew the best elixirs and find the right time to brew them to get the most points.\nThe multiverse has spoiled you given the vastness of incredible places and creatures to meet and observe. You smell spices from miles away, your pores dilate, your gills tickle and your three stomachs are growling like an echoing symphony. You get to the source of the tasty fumes faster than a ray of light, your taste buds start working as a glowing sign shows up on the horizon: \u201cServing succulent food and spicy, quenching potions during satellite setting hours.\u201d\nSpace Lunch is a 1-2 players, short, set-collection game. To win, you need to grab your preferred dishes before it\u2019s too late by choosing Food cards from the table. However, beware! Your opponent might interfere with your plans.\nThe new surface of Earth is at its most bleak appearance. It may seem completely infertile and arid, but on the horizon promising mountains of mud and clay arise higher and higher. Golems, the magical mutable creatures, are being summoned with synergies among the resources of the earth.\nGolems is a card collection game where you can use every card in two different ways. You have to decide whether you want to boost your Golem for victory points or save the resource to summon further Golems. With the use of Gems and special Runes you will be able to maximize your strategy to become the best Golem summoner.\nWe have always created games that we really enjoy playing and the Matchbox Collection is no exception, but every time we launch a new line of games, it is fundamental for us to understand if our vision resonates with you.\nAfter a year since our last campaign, we are very excited to share a brief moment with you to shape this new creation together; and this is among the most interesting and rewarding moments for us.\nKickstarter and retail are two very different worlds and both of them are extremely important for us, but sometimes you want to create something regardless of the production boundaries, and Kickstarter is the best place to shape the games we dreamt of exactly the way we envisioned them.\nThundergryph exclusive is a new way for us to experiment, understand the product better and find the best way to make it work; and while we are not offering a retail option, it doesn\u2019t mean that this line won\u2019t have a possibility of hitting retail.\nThese games might become a collectible exclusive to this campaign, but they could reach more players in the future as well.

Only by standing united will you have any chance of victory! \nLearn more about the Optional Buys: Return of the Sinister Six , The Infinity Gauntlet, Enter the Spider-Verse, Rise of the Black Panther, Guardians of the Galaxy Remix, Tales of Asgard, Playmat, Cardboard Locations\nPLAY\n\n Marvel United: The Core Heroes of Marvel United | The Core Villains of Marvel United | Designing the Heroes \n The Infinity Gauntlet: Learn the Secrets of the Infinity Gauntlet  | Rise of the Infinity Gauntlet \n Other: The Initial Promos of Marvel United \nMarvel United, The Infinity Gauntlet, Tales of Asgard, Guardians of the Galaxy Remix, Rise of the Black Panther, Enter the Spider-Verse, initial Promos, and Stretch Goals\nElektra, Kingpin, Daredevil, and America Chavez\nReturn of the Sinister Six, Squirrel Girl, and Doctor Strange\nNote that anything marked with this: \nis an exclusive item for Kickstarter backers (or from other crowdfunding platforms), with remaining stock available through conventions and special promotions only. \n\n\nWe will ship your rewards at our cost to our international hubs. Depending on where in the world you are, we will either ship to you from our hub in the UK (EU backers), China (Asia backers), Singapore (Singaporean backers), Canada (Canadian backers), Australia (Australia and New Zealand backers) or Atlanta (USA and the rest of the world). Following is a list of rough estimates for shipping a basic pledge. Keep in mind these are just estimates and that accurate costs will be calculated in the pledge manager system according to your address. Also keep in mind that costs will likely rise based on optional buys you choose.\nUnfortunately, different import laws and customs have made it impossible for CMON to ship games to certain specific countries.\nWE DO NOT SHIP TO: Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Afghanistan.\nBe aware that any pledges that are confirmed after the pledge manager deadline is considered a \"Late Confirm\" and will be shipped from the USA hub at a later date. For non-US backers, that will likely incur increased shipping costs. Also, note that Late Confirms will not be able to customize the contents of their pledge. They will be offered a single pledge, including most, if not all, Kickstarter Exclusive Optional Buys. We also cannot ship to PO Boxes domestically or internationally. Due to the size of each package there is too great a risk of the package being bounced back to us.\nThe table below gives you a general idea of the full schedule of what to expect once the campaign ends. Keep in mind these are just estimates, and the timeline may vary due to circumstances.\nTo learn about Retail Pledges click HERE.\n                                                                      \u00a9 2020 MARVEL", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our 42nd Kickstarter, and there are some vagaries in terms of timing when it comes to anything produced in China, such as:\nProduction delays\nShipping delays\nCustoms delays\n\nThe estimated delivery date for this project is March 2021, but keep in mind this is only an estimate. Also, due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others.\n\nWe've done our best to minimize this as much as possible, and we are always happy to refund pledges if for some totally unforeseen reason the game can't be delivered at all.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nWe can refund you within 14 days of the campaign\u2019s end, fees included. After that, we have a policy of no questions asked, though that\u2019s minus Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we can\u2019t get back from them after 14 days). However, if we\u2019ve begun packaging your pledge for shipment, no refunds are possible. If a component cannot be delivered AT ALL, we refund that completely, including fees.\n\nAll refunds after the 14 days close of the campaign may be processed via PayPal or reversed via Stripe to your credit card at our discretion. Refunds within 14 days are reversed via Stripe to your credit card.\n\nThis project is being funded in USD and any refunds processed will be in USD for the exact amount received in USD, excluding any applicable fees depending on the time of the refund being processed.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look, materials and content of the rewards (and the project) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented while the Kickstarter project was active.\n\nIf you do not log in and confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email to confirm your pledge, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received. However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your pledge if you contact us and confirm your pledge after the 8 week window has elapsed. Unconfirmed pledges make it difficult for us to plan production and logistics, and in the past have led to project delays. For this project we do not intend to allow this to happen, which may mean if you confirm your pledge too late, exclusive items may not be produced in sufficient quantity for your pledge.\n\nIf you confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods. We regret we are unable to ship to PO Boxes.\n\nAll backers that have selected \u201cNo Reward\u201d on Kickstarter, that wish to receive a reward for this campaign, must make sure to confirm their order by the Pledge Manager Deadline. We will announce the date for this once the Pledge Manager becomes live. All \u201cNo Reward\u201d pledges will be treated as donations once the Pledge Manager Deadline has passed.\n\nIf you do not accept these terms please do not pledge on this project, but instead wait for the retail release.\n\nTo make sure you have the best gaming experience, all CMON products are warrantied against manufacturing defects for 2 years from the of date purchase from CMON (proof of purchase required).

Everything that we were planning as stretch goals have already, automatically, been included in each copy of the game!\nSo instead, we've got some great stuff planned: several polls so you can help to shape the finished game, sneak peeks at game content and components, and contests to win cool prizes!\nOnce again, we're partnering with BackerKit to make it much easier for backers to manage their pledge choices and shipping information at the end of the campaign.\nWhen the campaign ends, you'll receive a BackerKit survey asking you to provide your shipping information so we can get your rewards to you. As part of this survey, you'll have the opportunity to add more copies of the game at regular price plus $5 shipping per additional game.\nWe are partnering with depots in the USA, Canada, Europe, China, and Australia to minimize the chances of additional duty and taxes being charged to you. Shipping to areas outside these regions may result in additional charges out of our control. Please research import regulations to learn about these potential costs for your country before  placing an order.\nEach pledge must be shipped to a single delivery address.

It's a unique gaming experience without a lot of baggage. Simple set-up, intuitive rules and minimal components. No DM, no bookkeeping or character sheet. Just you, an oversized deck of cards, dice and cube markers.\nMy influences for this game are rooted in the nostagia of my childhood. D&D, Planet of the Apes, Land of the Lost, Heavy Metal Magazine, Zork, and Monkey Island, to name a few.\n\nIt's the grisly tale of a strange tower that emerges in the heart of a bustling Viking city. The townsfolk have vanished. It\u2019s up to you to mount a rescue and unravel the mystery. \nYou move through the game like a book. But in this case, it's a stack of ominous cards. Flip them over, make difficult choices and let the story unfold. \n\nYou have an Ally Deck with 6 adventurers (6 chances) to face the countless dangers of the spire. From this deck you will randomly pick 2 starting Allies. But be warned, your path is paved in blood. If they die, and they will you will randomly select another Ally to take their place.\n\n\n\n\nThis is a six-chapter adventure, each of which includes a major encounter, loot, choices, dice chucking and more! It will require both skill and luck. \nThe hook is simple. In combat you perform actions at a cost. That cost is your character's hit points. Every action is a risk. To execute stronger attacks you will need to spend more hit points, which in turn leaves you weak and vulnerable. This makes for tense, close, ruthless battles.\nPlease note: This is a simplistic look at some basics in combat. There are many exciting variables to actions and their outcomes detailed in the instructions deck. Check out Kickbacks, Status Effects, Rest meters and more!\nEnemies will fight in a similar fashion, with a few exceptions. They don't spend Hit Points and their actions are determined by the Action Deck.\nEach enemy you will face has different hooks and mechanics to make them interesting. Some have story branches that trigger in the midst of battle.\n\n\nWhat would an adventure be without pesky trash mobs getting in your way? You can't head out on your first quest without clearing rats out of a cellar, right?\n\nMy goal was to make this game with as few components as possible without taking away from the gaming experience. It's a clean minimalistic approach to an in-depth and engrossing adventure.\nThe focus has always been the story deck. The heart of the game. It represents the spire, and each card is a layer you uncover during your descent. \nFrom the very start I wanted ENORMOUS PLAYING CARDS. These are custom 6.5 x 3.5 inch cards. They are about the same size as an iPhone X and they're glorious. Here's what's in the box. \n\n\n\nThis is not a randomly generated gaming experience. The concept here is to experience a specific storyline with multiple chapter branches and endings. Your choices, enemy encounters and items you discover will influence the overall narrative. There are multiple endings to uncover, some more unpleasant than others.\n\n\n\nHere is a look at the current Card Progression Tree for Chapters 1 and 2 to help illustrate the branching paths. Each square is a card. Black = Story Card, Red = Item Card, Dark Red = Encounter. Your story can splinter out in many different directions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsidering the complexities of the project I want to be transparent with the progress made and what's left to do.\n\nGreg is an Art Director and Graphic Designer currently residing in Los Angeles, CA. In his free time he's pumping whatever pop culture he can into his veins..or dreaming up new encounters for Spire's End!\n\nBenjamin is a Digital Artist from Berlin, Germany currently working as a freelance concept artist and illustrator. These days he uses every available minute for art and game design.\nErica is co-owner of Oaktown Spice Shop in Oakland, CA. Before starting a retail business with her husband, she was a journalist. She loves to cook and drink wine.\nChristian is co-owner of Hop Merchants Bottle Shop & Taproom, a craft beer bar in North Hollywood, CA.  He's a writer, a gamer and horror film fanatic.\n\n\nShipping will be charged after the campaign has ended. \nThe shipping rates listed below are conservative estimates NOT the official costs. Please note that these estimates are based on the core game. Any Stretch Goals unlocked during the campaign may change the weight and the size of the game, which could influence the final shipping cost. I will work to secure the best prices possible and attempt to lower these costs in proportion to the success of the campaign.\nBackers outside the countries listed above may be responsible for their own customs fees and any additional charges if and when they occur. Please message me regarding countries not listed for more information.\nPlease not that Spire's End is a work in progress, product is still in development.\nWarning: This is a fantasy/horror game that contains violence and disturbing imagery.

But with more than 15 years of graphic design and packaging experience, I am merely in a state of heightened panic.\n\nThis project, like many, started with very ambitious goals before it was wrangled into something reasonable for my first attempt. It began as a 12 chapter, 200 card epic. Due to the sheer scope of the game, production costs and the fact that I am just one person, the game is now 6 Chapters, with the hopes to continue later if successful.\n\nThe style guides and templates are set, and the writing for Chapters 1-6 are more than halfway there.\n\nMy aim is to keep things simple without compromising the game as much as possible. That being said, even with \u201csimple\u201d in mind I know that problems lurk around every corner. Game balancing and rewrites take time so I am giving myself a considerable amount of lead time to get this labor-intensive job done properly.\n\nNobody wants this game in their hands more than me. I dream about this thing. I spend my time in the shower planning the next encounter.

Based on the Root: A Game of Woodland Might & Right board game and officially licensed by Leder Games, Root: The TTRPG brings the tales of the Woodland to your RPG table!\nIn Root, you play vagabonds, outcasts from the normal society of the woodlands who have come to live in the spaces between, whether that's in the forests themselves or on the fringes of society. You are competent and skilled\u2014you have to be to survive as vagabonds\u2014and you aren\u2019t tied down to any particular place or faction. You might be a badger arbiter, serving many sides in resolving conflicts and defending their interests. You might be a cat scoundrel, sliding on your mask before you sneak out into the darkness to cause mischief and mayhem. You might be a wolf ranger, at home in the wilds and the untamed places of the woodland. \nRoot is based on the Powered by the Apocalypse system used by tabletop RPGs like Apocalypse World, Dungeon World, and many of Magpie Games\u2019s own games like Masks: A New Generation, Urban Shadows, and Zombie World. It uses the core framework of that system and provides a strong, simple way to tell your own stories of adventure in the woodland. You\u2019ll create a character using one of several vagabond archetypes, and then you\u2019ll take action, rolling two six-sided dice to resolve the outcomes of desperate situations.\nRoot creates stories like those you\u2019d find in Redwall, Watership Down, Mouse Guard, The Warriors, and The Guardians of Ga\u2019Hoole.\nThe Woodland is, first and foremost, a deep forest. It hides dark deeds, ancient ruins, and dangerous creatures. The land is not tame\u2014the trees and those who live in them are not safe.\nThe closest a denizen will come to safety in the Woodland are the confines of the clearings, areas either natural or paw-made where the trees thinned out and the denizens of the Woodland built lives. They set up homes and shops and forges, and they found safety in each other\u2019s company.\nOf course, it took no time at all for others to try to take power over these clearings. The Eyrie Dynasties were the first, and oldest\u2014the birds built their homes in the trees above the rest of the denizens, and soon enough believed themselves to be above those denizens in power and status, too. The Eyrie took control of clearing after clearing, until it was the reigning institution in all of the Woodland.\nBut the Eyrie's nobles and petty tyrants squabbled with each other over control and rulership. Until eventually, in the Grand Civil War (only \"Grand\" because it's the most recent), the Eyrie Dynasties tore themselves apart. They were left without enough support, armies, or resources to hold control over much of anything at all. And for a time, the Woodland denizens took charge of their own clearings.\nUntil the cats arrived. \n\nArmies from the far away Feline Empire swept into the now uncontrolled and undefended Woodland. Some denizens of the Woodland fought back, but the invaders were well-trained, well-equipped, and too much for any civilian militia to turn back. The valuable resources of the Woodland would feed the bellies of the Feline Empire. Soon enough, the Marquise de Cat, dispatched by the Empire\u2019s bureaucratic overlords, arrived to take control of the new colony, and the Woodland denizens found themselves under the paw of a new aristocracy.\nAs the cats were consolidating their rule and establishing new industrial buildings to tap the Woodland\u2019s resources, the newly reunited and resurgent Eyrie Dynasties returned to the Woodland, seizing power from the Marquise\u2019s forces to reestablish their hegemonic ascendancy. They rebuilt roosts in the treetops of the Woodland clearings, and opened up full war against the Marquise\u2019s soldiers.\nIn the midst of the blooming conflict, the denizens of the Woodland began sharing secrets and new words in the shadows. Foxes began stockpiling weapons, and mice began stealing communications between officers on all sides of the war. Meetings in root cellars called to a war for freedom, and the fires of rebellion began to smolder. The name of \u201cthe Woodland Alliance\u201d was whispered across the clearings.\n\nThe vagabonds have been a part of the Woodland for as long as anyone can remember. Outsiders and outcasts, criminals and ideologues, exiles and mercenaries\u2014those who didn\u2019t fit into the quieter lives of the clearings, who were hardy enough to survive in the spaces the other denizens avoided. Some dwelt in the forests themselves, completely eschewing the taboos against living in those most dangerous of places.\nIn times of peace, the vagabonds did what others would not, for a price of course. In times of war, the vagabonds found ample opportunity to fill their purses, from scavenging to sellsword work to straight-up thievery. In all cases, they would do what it took to survive, each one finding their own niche of safety and damn the rest.\nBut now, in the midst of this great war that threatens the whole of the Woodland, even the normally solitary vagabonds are finding it more and more difficult to survive by their lonesome. They are banding together, protecting each other, and forming into groups potent enough that even the great powers of the Eyrie and the Marquisate are taking notice...\nThe thick woods of the Woodland keep the denizens contained to the pathways and the clearings. To venture out beyond that safety is to risk running afoul of bandits, foul weather and rough terrain, and terrible things like bears. Fortunately, those paths between clearings are well-worn and patrolled by merchants and armed forces.\nThe clearings play home to many, many different kinds of denizen, from wolves to badgers to squirrels to opossums. But the primary inhabitants of the Woodland are the birds, foxes, mice, and rabbits. The birds spread themselves out among all the clearings, but most clearings are dominated by a majority of one kind of denizen. \n\nSome clearings will be open and friendly to any kind of Woodland denizen, from those who dominate their clearing to those who are from far away; other clearings will fear any strangers who come by.\nAs vagabonds, you can navigate the Woodland both on its paths, and by venturing into its forests, braving the dangers that no others will face.\nIn Root, you will travel from clearing to clearing, and you will take on jobs and missions from diverse sources, and in so doing you will reshape the Woodland as you change the course of the war between those who would rule it.\nTo do all that, the game uses the Powered by the Apocalypse framework to resolve interesting moments of uncertainty. The game has a set of moves, bits of mechanics that by and large say: \u201cWhen you do [x], [y] happens.\u201d Each move trigger\u2014the \u201cWhen you do [x]\u201d part\u2014is designed to help point at moments of uncertainty, when neither the players nor the GM know exactly what happens next. Some examples of such moments include:\nWhen you swing your sword at a towering buzzard Eyrie soldier.\nWhen you try to sneak past a group of bandits to plunder their secret stash.\nWhen you plead with the rabbit mayor to evacuate her clearing in advance of a major battle.\nWhen you try to trick a Marquisate guard post into giving you the food and supplies you desperately need.\nAnd so on. When you trigger a move\u2014when you perform the action described in the move\u2019s trigger\u2014then the rest of the move kicks into effect, most of the time requiring some kind of die roll. You\u2019ll roll 2d6 (two six-sided dice) and add in one of your stats to find out what happens.\nEvery vagabond has five stats:\nEach one is ranked between -2 and +3. You\u2019ll add your stat to some rolls when you trigger certain moves. For example, when you clash sword-to-sword with a foe, you\u2019ll roll 2d6 + Might.\nOn most moves, if you get a 10 or higher (10+), things will go your way! If you get a 7-9, you\u2019ll get what you were after, but usually with some cost or complication. If you get a 6 or lower, that\u2019s called a miss, and the GM gets to tell you what happens next\u2014and you can bet your tail it won\u2019t be good.\nThe Root RPG will have basic moves for all of the different common activities that the vagabonds are likely to get up to, along with special moves for traveling and battle.\nBeyond those basic mechanics, the Root TTRPG features a slew of specific and carefully designed systems for some of the important, unique elements of the Woodland.\nThe Woodland is a big place with many different clearings. The paths between the clearings are safer than the woods themselves, but they\u2019re certainly far from safe. And even though the vagabonds are brave enough to travel the width and breadth of the Woodland, it\u2019s not any safer for them than for anyone else. It might even be more dangerous.\nYour adventures across the Woodland will take you from clearing to clearing, using the paths or slipping through the forests in ways that only the vagabonds can. Every clearing has its own problems, after all, and that means every clearing is a bed of lucrative opportunities for enterprising vagabonds like yourselves. \nTo handle all that travel, the Root RPG features a set of moves designed to allow the vagabonds to move between clearings with ease at a player level, but with interesting complications and concerns at a character level. Will the vagabonds sacrifice their exhaustion to travel more safely along the paths? Will they spend more supplies and degrade their equipment to travel quickly through the forests? Or will they chance being waylaid by the many dangers of the Woodland\u2014anything from bandits to squads of soldiers to BEARS?\nVagabonds are all very skilled and capable individuals\u2014after all, they have to be in order to survive! To represent their capabilities, every vagabond has access to all the basic moves, their own special playbook moves, and weapon moves.\nWeapon moves are the skills that the vagabonds use in combat to wield their weapons with unmatched prowess. Each vagabond will have access to a portion of the overall weapon moves, and as long as they have the right weaponry to then use those moves, they can perform incredible feats, from smashing through heavy armor with a single blow, to bouncing arrows off walls to reach an unreachable target, to taking out unsuspecting foes instantly.\nIn Root: The Tabletop Roleplaying Game, each vagabond has three tracks representing their wellbeing. Their exhaustion track represents how tired they are, how much energy they have left to give. Their decay track represents how much of their supplies they\u2019ve used up. And their injury track represents how many major blows they\u2019ve taken.\nUsing the three different tracks lets the Root RPG land consequences in different ways, pushing the vagabonds to take different actions to deal with those consequences. A band of vagabonds with all their decay boxes marked will need to seek more supplies or the aid of a blacksmith, and soon, while a band with all their exhaustion boxes marked needs to find a safe place to hunker down and rest. Filling in these boxes will ultimately lead to more stories as the vagabonds move from clearing to clearing to resupply and recover.\nRoot: A Game of Woodland Might & Right, the original Root board game, featured a Woodland at war, caught in a struggle between different, powerful factions. The Marquise de Cat and her industrializing armies; the Eyrie Dynasties and their bureaucratic structure; the Woodland Alliance and its insurgent revolts. The Vagabond was one of the factions in the original game, but its role was often of a single adventurer, slipping in and out of greater conflicts, helping one side, hurting another, all the while ready to tip the scales in favor of one group or another.\nIn Root: The Tabletop Roleplaying Game, that idea of a living backdrop for the adventures of the vagabond is crucial. Clearings will not sit, static and unchanging, while the vagabonds go on adventures. They will be taken or lost in the wars between the factions. Sometimes those factions might actually improve the clearings. Other times those factions will destroy buildings, take advantage of the populace, and take hold of any valuable resources.\n\nAnd amid this ongoing war between the factions for control of the Woodland, the vagabonds will adventure and tip the balance. They will have reputations with different factions, allowing them to borrow resources or even lead forces from friendly factions, and leading to constant conflict with opposing factions. Their decisions will change the Woodland.\nWe\u2019re excited to bring to you two different books through this Kickstarter, along with digital versions of both and deluxe, Kickstarter Exclusive editions!\nRoot: The Tabletop Roleplaying Game and Root: Travelers & Outsiders will both come in PDF form.

Players will choose a personal design to follow, while trying to create color and pattern combinations that are not only aesthetically pleasing, but also able to attract the cuddliest cats! \nCalico comes with many different cat and pattern goals to mix and match new challenges each and every time you play! There are thousands of unique puzzles!\n\n  + Kickstarter Promo Cats \nKickstarter backers of Calico will also receive a special double-sided promo cat scoring tile and four additional cat tokens FREE! These cats add 'largest pattern group' and 'longest pattern line' scoring options, giving you more ways to play! After the Kickstarter campaign, these cards will not be included with the game.\nCheck out this How-to-play video by Bebo of Be Bold Games!\nLearn all about Calico with Theo from Geeky Gaymer Guy in this game overview!\nSolo Mode\nCalico can be played solo! The solo game elegantly simulates a 2-player experience by turning the tile market into a conveyor-belt. Players will need to make difficult decisions about which tiles to take, as each turn brings changes to the market. The solo mode is simple to learn and does not involve any of the complexity of upkeep of an AI player - just you and a relaxing game of interesting puzzly choices as you sew your quilt! \n Family Mode\nCalico also has a family mode! If you are playing with children, those new to gaming, or you just want to make the puzzle a little simpler, you simply flip over the design goal tiles and only play for cat and color points! It's a super accessible option that anyone can dive into, but still provides plenty of strategy!\n We believe Calico is has such a fantastic mix of approachability and strategic depth, that we decided to put a team together to make it a reality! The rules are simple, and the mechanisms of drafting and tile placement are accessible to a very wide audience. Anyone can perform the basic actions and have a great time trying to puzzle out what their next move will be.\nThe sense of accomplishment of putting together a beautiful quilt will satisfy gamers of all types. Although it is a perfect gateway experience for new gamers, more advanced strategy game players will be right at home with the variable design goals, which make the challenge and reward of each new game extremely satisfying.\n We know that gamers love sharing the hobby with their friends and family and Calico is the perfect game to do just that!\nSince this is our first publication, we do not have retail distribution to get Calico to a wider audience - this means this is your first and best chance to get the game. \nOur philosophy is that our backers are major contributors to our passion and our business. We do not take this lightly, and we know there is always risk in backing a crowdfunding campaign. Because of this, we want to make sure that our backers get the best possible experience and we show our appreciation for their early support.\nThe pledge levels you are backing this product at are set to give you the greatest possible value as our way of saying thank you for your early support. You are all so important the success of the game - we can\u2019t do this without each and every one of you, and we very much recognize and appreciate that! We also look forward to chatting with you about the process and the game overall. This is going to be a lot of fun!\nWe are focused on you - please let us know if there is anything we can do to improve the backer experience, and we will do our very best!\nRetailers\nCertified retailers interested in backing can email us through our website: https://www.flatout.games/contact. Please use the subject line: CALICO RETAILER when reaching out to us. We would love to connect with you and offer you an opportunity to carry our game. We do not have a pledge level for retailers, but we will offer reduced prices on bulk orders to certified brick-and-mortar retailers.\nRahdo Runs Through Calico!\nTom and Marty from Slickerdrips play Calico!  \nWe have put a lot of time and effort into the design and development of Calico. We believe that we are presenting you with a complete and refined game that is as good as it can be, right out of the box. However, there are plenty of component upgrades and little extras that will simply not be possible without a larger initial print run. As our funding numbers grow, we will be reinvesting extra money into upgrading the quality of the game components and adding fun bonuses along the way!\nThe more funding we can achieve as a team, the better everyone\u2019s copy of the game will be, so please share this project so that we can get the components \u2018fully stitched\u2019!    \nCheck out Rahdo's Final Thoughts!\nCheck out Tantrum House's Preview!\nCheck out Slickerdrips' First Impressions!\n Check out Plumpy Thimble's Review!\nCheck out The Game Shelf's Preview here!\nCheck out Meeple Mountain's Review here!\nCheck out Draft Mechanic's Podcast Feature here!\nCheck out Open Seat Gaming's Review here!\nCheck out Steph's thoughts on Calico here!\nCheck out BJ's thoughts on Calico here!\nCheck out Purple Phoenix's Review here!\nCheck out What's Eric Playing's Preview here!\n Check out Variable Player Power Podcast Episode 1 featuring Calico!\nCheck out Geek Dad's Review here!\nCheck out Off Shelf's Origins article here!\n Check out Inquisitive Meeple's Review here! \n\n Check out Geek Craft's Review here! \nWe know that part of the challenge of backing a Kickstarter campaign is that there is a considerable cost attached to shipping games from our manufacturing partners directly to your door. We would like to help with some of that burden, so we are offering a discount off of our quoted shipping rates to all of our backers.\nShipping will be charged in our post-campaign pledge manager. Using the pledge manager, you will be able to confirm your rewards, confirm your address, and finalize your order. We have included shipping estimates for some common geographical areas in the chart below. Please note that these are estimates and the actual costs of shipping could change based on many circumstances. We are dedicated to getting you the best possible value for shipping and are committed to shouldering a portion of the burden of shipping the game to you. We will provide customs friendly shipping to the USA, Canada, the EU, and Australia. You can read more about shipping in Update #6.\nBacking for additional copies of the game will offer lower per-unit shipping costs.\nIf you have any questions about shipping, please contact us.\nFlatout Games is a board game design collaborative founded in 2017 by members Molly Johnson, Robert Melvin, and Shawn Stankewich. As a design collaborative, they have several designs under their belt, including the Cardboard Edison and LUCI award finalist Point Salad (available now from AEG); Public Market (coming 2020 from Talon Strikes Studios); and Dollars to Donuts and Abstract Academy (coming 2020 from Crafty Games).\n What's this 'CoLab' all about?\nIn early 2019 Flatout Games opened its doors to create The Flatout Games CoLab. The CoLab is an opportunity for the founding members of Flatout Games to team up with awesome emerging folks in the board game industry and make cool things together. Our approach is to build the best possible experiences by involving everyone in the entire process. We strive to build passion in each of our collaborators through shared efforts and shared profits. This CoLab publication of Calico is a passion project of everyone involved, and we are all part of an interconnected team - we take risks and are rewarded together. We hope you will join us on our journey!\nLet's meet the CoLab members!\nThe CoLab teamed up with Beth Sobel to bring you the artwork in Calico! You can check out her work here!\nFlatout Games is focused on creating innovative and elegant game experiences. We love puzzly games with simple rules, high replayability, and great tension! Players\u2019 options and decisions should be complex, rules should not be. We love products that are immaculately detailed, and designed with clarity and simplicity at the forefront.  \n\nAnd, finally, YOU! \nThank you so much for taking the time to learn more about Calico! We would love to bring it to life, and with your help, we can make that dream a reality!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nEvery project has its risks - there are plenty of circumstances within and outside of our control that could come up. Since this is our first crowdfunding campaign, we have done our homework and been actively engaged in reaching out to others who have been successful. We are also Superbackers ourselves, so we have shown commitment to the amazing community on Kickstarter and have followed along on many other campaigns. In addition, we have members of our CoLab team who have been involved with successful campaigns in the past, so we feel we have positioned ourselves with the knowledge and experience required to make sure things go as smoothly as possible.\n\nWe have already done a considerable amount of the legwork involved in getting this game made and getting it into your hands. We have completed design and development, nearly completed artwork, and lined up manufacturing and logistics. We have a plan to get the game completed to the highest degree of quality and get it in your hands as soon as possible.\n\nWe are also committed to being open and transparent about our process and the challenges and triumphs associated with it.

As a Squire, you get extra points for collecting loot that is useful for your hero, and bonuses towards completing certain quests.\n   Two cards are flipped to either side of the Story deck, so the Loot side is face-up. If you complete a Story, you get to pick one loot card to try to add to your bag.\n Story cards can be completed one of two ways:\n 1.  The item type on the left of the Story card shows the Item Value you need in your bag. \nA red weapon icon with the number 2 requires a combination of daggers, swords or bows that total 2 spaces in your bag.\n 2.  You can also use an item. \n     To use an item, pick a Loot card to take as your reward first. Then, use an item on the new Loot card to fully cover the item you wish to use.  \nA blue armour icon with '-1' means you must cover one complete helmet, shield, or chest-plate with an item on the new loot card.\nThere are a couple simple rules for placing Loot cards in your bag:\nYou must place one full item from the loot card into the same number of empty or occupied spaces in your bag. If you try to cover spaces occupied by items, the entire item must be covered. \n Junk items also count as empty spaces, but deduct 1 point each from your score if left uncovered.\nIf your bag doesn't have enough spaces to place an item from the loot card, (or you don't want to place a new card) you must return the loot card. \n    Once you have completed a story and placed a loot card, end your turn by flipping the story card over next to the deck. (If two loot cards are already there, you get to choose which one to cover.)\nOnce all possible loot cards are claimed, it's time to add up each Squire's points to determine the winner!\n *Hint: Each tier comes with a Score Sheet digital download to keep track of your high scores for each character!\nEach weapon, armour, magic or valuable item is worth 1 point each. Extra points are added for your Squire's card item combinations and bonuses.\n Identical items (ie. two daggers, two shields, etc) placed together are worth 1 extra point.  \nDeduct 1 point for each Junk item still visible in your bag.\nPrint and Play\nDuring the Kickstarter campaign, I've made the early version of the Print & Play files available for FREE on PnP Arcade. Download here:\nhttps://www.pnparcade.com/collections/new-games/products/squire-for-hire\nBGG - Squire for Hire \nFind the Board Game Geek page HERE and add Squire for Hire to your pre-order collection.\n Playthrough Video (Solo) \nProvided by @Board_and_Brew \n Playthrough Video (Multiplayer) \nProvided by @VorpalBoard\n        Growing up, I was an all-around RPG gaming geek, artist, musician and general collector of nerdy things. I've always been a big fan of old school PC games like Morrowind, Diablo, Dungeon Siege, and Quest for Glory 5. I also collected card games of every kind, and would organise them into binders based on type, colour or just by the artwork that I liked. \nThat love of collecting and managing stuff never died, and served as the inspiration for making a game about the unsung heroes of fantasy - the Squires! (Honorable mention to all the horses and level up perks that gave our RPG characters extra inventory capacity). \n Squire for Hire scratches that inventory management itch, letting you collect and strategically place items in a fast and re-playable tile laying game you can take anywhere. I've packed as much as possible into 18 cards, and I believe have made a game that plays well not only as a single player time-killer, but also a two player game night addition. \n     However,  the game is not yet finished. The tabletop community has been incredibly supportive so far, and I'm sure the game will continue to improve with community feedback as the campaign goes on.\nPrototype Shown - artwork not final\nSquire for Hire can also be played solo, and makes a great way to kill some extra time on your lunch break, or while waiting for a flight, etc. In solo play, you must prove your worth by scoring at least 30 points to get hired! Keep track of your high scores to see how good you can get!\nLooking to play with up to four people?\nSimply grab another copy of the game at the discounted rate, shuffle the two decks together and you are all set! Doubling the card count also works great in two-player!\n\"Squire for Hire is a great game, it can fit in your pocket and can be played solo and with two players. It is ideal for travelling or when waiting for a friend or gaming buddy. It plays quick, has a small foot print and has a decent amount of choices available.\" \n- Matt, The Friendly Boardgamer \nhttps://thefriendlyboardgamer.wordpress.com/2019/08/20/squire-for-hire-final-thoughts/\n\"I really like the game itself and how clever it is for just being 18 cards. The story cards flipping to become available loot cards works really well... We played twice in a row because it\u2019s a fun puzzle that plays so quickly.\" \n- Stefan, Foxbo Games\nI wanted to keep everything as lean as possible, without compromising on a quality, professional product that will hold up for hopefully hundreds of plays. And because the game comes in such a small package, the weight was also low enough to include FREE shipping to Canada and the US! International orders will be $5 extra shipping.\nYou also get a discounted rate on additional copies. To add one to your order, simply add $12 CAD (about $9 USD) to your order. (Remember, you can play with up to four people by adding an extra copy! Each copy comes with the bonus KS card).\nIf you've backed the Squire for Hire pledge, you can add a second custom card by adding $52 CAD (about $40 USD). \nFor international backers, your $5 shipping will cover the first two games. For each game past the first two, please add $5 PER GAME.\n What about Stretch Goals? \nSorry, not for this one. To keep shipping costs as low as possible (or free) I am limited in the amount of physical rewards I can add. However, I have included a few little bonuses to make sure this is a great product right out of the gate:\n Squire for Hire Illustrated Wallpaper - A hi-res illustrated wallpaper for your computer or tablet featuring the squires. \n Score Sheets - Download and print these score sheets so you can track your high scores with each Squire.\n UV/Gloss Coating on all cards and packaging. It protects them from dirt, scratches, and moisture.\n Upgraded Hook box - UV coated with printed rules on the inside. The cards do not fit when sleeved, so I wanted to offer something a little more protective than a paper envelope and paper rules. \n Kickstarter Exclusive Squire card - This will be a limited print of this extra card available only for the Kickstarter. We can come up with a new idea and vote on which one we want to include that fits with the theme of the game. (Since the game comes pre-shrink wrapped, this card will ship in a protective sleeve with the game, but should fit in the box once opened.) \n\nWhere can I find more of your games?\nAs an artist, I always have a project on the go in some form or another. I do everything from children's book illustrations and book covers to commissioned paintings and concept art. But I've always been an avid gamer in one sense or another and love designing my own games, even as a kid. The last few years, I've released a couple of my own games through The Game Crafter.

The artwork, packaging and graphic design are already finished for the base game. After the project is funded, I have allotted extra time to get the custom cards drawn. (I have imposed a limit to make sure it doesn't affect the timeline for ordering the cards). \n\nThe games will ship to me pre-packaged (minus the bonus cards) which will save a ton of prep time so I can ship them out quickly.

With an open call for designers, we found a great creative team full of innovative and diverse ideas. We work iteratively off of creativity, which produced a great set of new and fresh games.\nWe are proud to bring you the ten unique and wonderful games that make up Dice & Ink: Volume I.\nJoey Schouten is our developer, and has likely played and studied more roll-and-write games than perhaps anyone on earth. He is currently completing his thesis on board game adaptations of video games as part of the MSc Game Studies, an interdisciplinary study that deals with game design for non-entertainment purposes (such as serious gaming, or educational games). His wide and deep knowledge of the roll and write genre, and an uncanny ability to give meaningful and actionable feedback to designers, make him the person to head up development and scouting for Inkwell Games.\nOdin Phong (sounds like pong) is our Head of Publishing and Logistics, a lifelong gamer with a background in sales, warehousing and management. He brings industry knowledge, entrepreneurial spirit, numbers knowhow, and a growing expertise in the retail games establishment to the team. His contacts in the industry, profit and loss focus, outside the box ideation, and a willingness to undertake the less flashy side of games publishing make him highly qualified to undertake the physical publishing, logistics, and business operations for Inkwell Games.\nCalvin Wong Tze Loon is our Rulebook Editor Extraordinaire. Loves the English language and often uses his acerbic wit to call out injustice. His acute command of the language, and a well honed narrative sense make him invaluable as an editor and fiction writer for our book. Calvin has worked on other great games such as Pasaraya: Supermarket Manager and Fire in the Library.\nToni Catino (Little Island Gift Shops) started designing games when she was in middle school, first with custom Pokemon cards, then with games based on her favorite books and subjects. She loves all things board games, card games, and miniatures, but might love the designing of them just a bit more. Her goal in creating games is always to make something fun, that people will enjoy and want to share with their friends and family, because that\u2019s what board games are for!\nJesse Catron (Coral Relief) is a lifelong boardgamer. His game Salmon Run was published in 2013 by Eagle Gryphon Games, after which he took a hiatus from game design upon the arrival of his 3 children. He lives with his family in Maryland and works as an Optometrist.\nRobin Gibson (Kuiper Kowboys) has been compulsively designing games since he was very young. At any time he has several dozen projects on the go tabletop and video games, but lately his attention has been focused on one-page solo games in the Legends of Dsyx and Paper Pinball series, and illustrating Chris Anderson's Tempus Quest. Robin's major creative influences are only the most obscure video games and cartoons. He's heard that television exists with real people in it, but has yet to see any evidence of this. Robin lives in British Columbia with his wife and a small bird. He works as an educational assistant and homeless support worker.\nRyan Hoye (Icy Dice) began unofficially designing board games 7 years ago when a multimedia art project morphed into a simultaneous movement electronic board game based on Pac-Man. He has officially been doing game design for about 3 years as a creative outlet to balance out a relatively uncreative full-time job. To help foster his design skills, Ryan joined the newly founded Kansas City Game Designers in January of 2016 where he has playtested other\u2019s works and has taken in feedback on his own creations.\nGrace Kendall (Celestial Stories) is a bit surprised to take on the mantle of game designer, but after two years of working on co-designs they\u2019re proud to introduce their first solo game to the world! This celestial storytelling game is a natural fit for Grace, who has been telling stories for years and is often found lurking in the woods (where the brightest stars live). Outside of board games, Grace is a dedicated member of the wizard rock community and spends a ridiculous amount of time writing sad songs about books. When not telling stories, Grace enjoys eating macaroni & cheese and being barefoot.\nNat Levan (PenSylvania) is an experienced game designer known for New Bedford and Nantucket from Dice Hate Me Games, and Supertall and Timestamp from Buttonshy Games, and the 2018 ION award winning American Steel. He loves designing and playing games about cities, history, and overlooked industries. He lives in the Philadelphia Suburbs with his wife, son, and cat, where he has been designing games since 2012.\nJoe Montgomery (Lost at Sea) is a game designer in Seattle who finds his design inspiration from some of the most fantastic and unexplained corners of the world. He loves strange games and is hopeful that his designs will be as thought-provoking as they are enjoyable. Joe is currently working on a card game about constructing massive concrete structures for infamous dictators and a tableau-building game of alien archaeology set in late 1980\u2019s Norway. For the last year and a half, Joe has been bringing these games to the weekly Seattle game designer meet-ups for some brutally honest feedback.\nSarah and Will Reed (Scrapyard Rollbot) are a husband and wife design team. They started getting into board game design when Will wanted to create a board game for Sarah\u2019s birthday. Given the fact he has a vision disability, it was a bit challenging to get the project done by himself. So instead of giving up, he decided it would be a lot of fun to have her involved in the process.That first game turned out to be a game called Scrapyard. More games, such as Oaxaca: Crafts of a Culture and Project Dreamscape, followed. Now, years later, Will and Sarah are revisiting the Scrapyard theme for Scrapyard Rollbot.\nBehrooz \u2018Bez\u2019 Shahriari (Flowers over Towers) has been fascinated by games since her first memory: from Prince of Persia and Lode Runner on computers, to multi-day epic games of Risk and pencil/paper games played against classmates in school. In 2008, Bez found modern board games and within a few years had started designing tabletop games. In 2012, Bez moved to London and found a regular playtest group, which allowed for the iteration and continued design/development of her first mass-produced game. Yogi/In A Bind continues to sell well. However, Bez is most proud of her 2nd thing - a game system for which many games have been created and a community continues to develop. Bez continues to self-publish games and started pitching games to other companies in 2019.\nAlexander Shen (Islands of Atlantis) works as a Senior Technical Program Manager at one of those Silicon Valley companies where you have to circle around the parking lot for a space if you show up just a tad too late.

He named his company Cheapass Games, and we're still going today.\nSince that first year, we have released more than 100 original games: card games, board games, dice games, free games, and more. \nCheapass Games in Black and White is a collection of all of our black and white games, with the rules and histories of favorites like Kill Doctor Lucky, Lord of the Fries, Button Men, and many others. It also has many more obscure games, like Escape from Elba, Pennywise, Dogfight, and The Lost Pueblo of Doctor Green, and a few prototypes and unreleased games you've never heard of.\nIf you're a fan of Cheapass Games, an aspiring game designer, or just interested in the history of the company, read on.\nThis is the simplest campaign we have ever run. We have just one product: the book itself, in electronic and paper form. Our \"Collector's Pack\" includes the print and electronic versions of the book, as well as a limited edition book plate signed by James Ernest. \nBecause this is just a book, it can't contain the actual boards and cards from many of these games. However, during this campaign we will also post 30 of the best-loved games in a free print-and-play format, one on each day of the campaign. Check back daily for updates, challenges, and surprises!\nWe will also be playing as many of these games as we can, in a week-long livestream, broadcast from the Greater Than Games headquarters in St. Louis. This marathon will take place April 8-12, the second week of the campaign, and will feature the whole Cheapass Games family, folks from Greater Than Games, and surprise special guests!\nCheapass Games in Black and White will cover more than 100 Cheapass Games in their original form, including the cover art, sample board and card art, and complete rulebooks. We've changed almost nothing in these games, except where we absolutely had to (like removing our old street address from the credits). Note: While games are not playable from the book, we're posting a free print-and-play game every day of the campaign to join our already-extensive library of free games at cheapass.com!\nFor a sample of what's to come, check out these preview sections of the book covering Huzzah! and Kill Doctor Lucky!\nWe don't have a final page count, but our current guess is roughly 600 pages! Along with the games, the book includes designer's commentary on each one, including company history, design challenges, and sometimes examples of the prototype games that led up to the final product. \nThe dimensions will be roughly 10.5\" x 7.5,\" hardback, with black and white pages throughout. (Even for the few games that were in color. Because hey, we're cheap!) \nThis is one of Carol's accounting textbooks, cleverly wrapped to look like the real thing. The cover design is still not final.\nCheapass Games was founded in 1996 by game designer James Ernest and his wife Carol Monahan. Our early games were cheap black-and-white games in paper envelopes, sold without spare parts, so players had to scrounge their own pieces like pawns, dice, and tokens. Two of our earliest games, Kill Doctor Lucky and Give Me the Brain, won Origins Awards for the best games of 1997.\nOver the next few years, Cheapass Games released dozens of titles, sometimes averaging a new title every month. We introduced the imprint \"James Ernest Games\" in 1998, with our first full-color game, FALLING. In 1999, we introduced the Button Men brand, which had more than 20 expansions and over 300 characters. (But for this book it still only counts as \"one game.\")\nIn 2001 we introduced the cheaper-than-cheap \"Hip Pocket Games\" line, which included several small card games priced at $4-$5. Nearly every single one of those games made it into the GAMES 100. And throughout this period, James Ernest continued to design games for Cheapass as well as other game publishers.\nIn 2006, Cheapass Games took some time off. After releasing more than 100 titles, we decided our current business model was unsustainable, and James Ernest took a break to work in the digital games industry, while still maintaining a website full of free games. \nCheapass returned to printing in 2013 with the help of Kickstarter, starting with a deluxe reprint of Unexploded Cow. Since then, we have run eleven successful campaigns, including Pairs: A New Classic Pub Game and Tak: A Beautiful Game. Our latest entries in the \"black and white\" market, Veritas and Fish Cook, were great games, but met with lukewarm success. Thereafter, in this phase we have focused primarily on deluxe games for retail stores, and an ever-growing assortment of free games on our website.\nNow Cheapass Games has partnered with Greater Than Games in St. Louis, entering another exciting phase of our history. This book project comes at a perfect time to collect all the legacy games in one place, and make room for amazing games still to come. \nJames Ernest demonstrates how to use the product\n \"Cheapass Games practically defined gaming for me early in the board game renaissance, much more than big crossover hits like Catan. James Ernest ran the game equivalent of a punk rock zine. Always worth more than you paid, always bold and creative, sometimes simply revelatory.\"\n-Chris Floyd, Game Director, Deck Nine Games \n \"If you've ever wanted to get to know a designer and their games, James Ernest's conversational, familiar style makes you feel like you're in the room with him; chatting about life, games, and juggling. Cheapass Games in Black & White is a fantastic peek into the history of how the company got started and how each game was lovingly cobbled together.\"\n-Jessica Fisher, Gameosity writer and Geek & Sundry contributor \n\"James Ernest not only changed the games industry, he also changed the way the industry thought about itself. By proving that low-fi could be high art he gave it the biggest kick in the ass since Dungeons & Dragons, and earned a legion of devoted fans by doing it. If you want to know how, or you have aspirations to change the games industry yourself, then read this book to understand the importance of being Ernest.\"\n-James Wallis, Designer, The Extraordinary Adventures of Baron Munchausen\n\"Cheapass Games wasn't just a trailblazer for a kind of lo-fi gaming that put fun first and pricey gewgaws last -- it was a showcase for absolutely brilliant game design, a punk genius of the games world. Ernest's behind-the-scenes history of the company and its products reveal a business as humane, human-scale and idiosyncratic as its games.\"\n-Cory Doctorow, New York Time bestselling author of Walkaway and Radicalized\n\"Quantity is a type of quality.\"\n-Christopher Badell, Editor-in-Chief and Co-owner at Greater Than Games\nShipping is complicated. Here's what you need to know.\n We don't include the price of shipping in our level price, because it's different for different destinations. And if we bake it into the US pledge level price, people mistake the higher pledge level for the retail price of the product.  So, when you select a pledge level, there will be an additional shipping charge based on your location.   \nNow, on to a more detailed explanation of the shipping charges for each of these regions:\nFor US backers, we are offering $6 shipping. Fortunately, this Kickstarter campaign is for a book! That means that we can use the USPS Media Mail Service to deliver your reward. It might take a few days longer, but it is cheap! All US orders will ship from our US warehouse in St. Louis, MO via USPS.\nFor Canadians, we are offering $12 shipping per item. This also covers import taxes and customs duties, which we will pay at the point when the books enter Canada. Of course, $12 is not quite the actual cost of shipping and import duties to Canada for every possible Canadian destination. However, it is close to our estimated average, and we really want to make this book as accessible as possible in Canada. $12 is a nice, low, flat rate that we can live with from a business perspective. All Canadian orders will ship from our US warehouse, but be delivered via FedEx Canada - we will cover all customs and import duties.\nFor Australians, we are offering $25 shipping per item. This also covers import taxes and customs duties, which we will pay at the point when the products enter Australia. Because Australia is such a large country, $25 is not the actual cost of shipping to everyone in the country, especially to the people who live outside of major cities. However, we really want to make this book as accessible as possible in Australia because we know how hard it can be to get US products in Australia. We have lowered this cost substantially by partnering with an Australian distributor and fulfillment house. All Australian orders will be shipped by VR Distribution.\nFor Russians and South Americans, shipping will cost $59 per item. This does NOT include any customs duties or import taxes. Unfortunately, this is incredibly high, and reflects the fact that it is incredibly expensive and incredibly difficult to successfully ship any items to these countries. In addition, we are only willing to make a single delivery attempt to you in any of these countries. If any shipments are lost or returned to us, we will unfortunately not be able to re-ship them. We will refund you your pledge minus a 20% fee to cover Kickstarter and other fees. We really do not want to do this, as it will cost us an incredibly large amount of money (the actual shipping charges, and then the return charges if the item is returned). However, it costs us even more money every campaign to ship multiple times to countries with very complex customs and import regimes. All Russian and South American orders will be shipped by Spiral Galaxy Games in the UK.\nFor Europeans (including EU countries as well as Norway and Switzerland, but unfortunately not Russia or other non-EU countries), we are offering $17 shipping + VAT. What does this mean? Well, it turns out that the EU has been really tightening the rules on VAT and import duties recently as a result of widespread VAT fraud on the part of foreign companies. You can read some of the details here, but the summary is that, according to EU law, almost all items imported into the EU are subject to VAT charges (generally 20%-25% in the case of board games) based on the actual sale price PLUS the actual shipping cost. That means that, for example, for a $59 game with $17 shipping, the 24% VAT will be assessed against the total $76 price, and will come out to approximately $18.24. Fortunately for this campaign, it turns out that most of the governments in Europe (though not all) have decided that books should be taxed at a substantially lower VAT rate! \nNote that this law applies no matter how we fulfill the campaign. If we ship from the US, each parcel is subject to a VAT charge once it enters the EU. On the other hand, if we ship a bunch of goods to a fulfillment center in the EU, the whole shipment is subject to VAT when it enters the EU and, even though the goods are arriving in bulk, the VAT is based on the actual sales price to consumers (in this case, on what they paid during the campaign), not on the lower wholesale or manufacturing cost, so this method doesn\u2019t actually save any money on VAT charges (though there can be other benefits). In this case, all European orders will be shipped by Spiral Galaxy Games in the UK.\nVAT rates for books and games vary wildly. If you want to look into it in more detail, this website has a good amount of information. For the rest of you, here is a handy chart!\nEuropean Shipping Questions\nQ: Why are you charging VAT separately from shipping charges for Europeans?\nA: As we mentioned above, the VAT charges are based on the sale price + shipping. If we include VAT as part of the \u201cshipping\u201d charge, EU customs is likely to consider that whole charge to be \u201cshipping\u201d and charge VAT based on the full amount, including what we already charged for VAT!\nQ: How much am I going to pay to get this game in Europe?\nA: There is a fixed $17 fee per item for shipping, which you will pay via Kickstarter. Then, before the campaign is fulfilled, we will correctly calculate each European backer\u2019s VAT and charge you for it via the pledge manager before shipping out your parcel. We will wait to use the pledge manager, since your VAT rate will vary depending upon the final shipping address you give us within Europe.\nQ: Will I have to pay any customs clearance fees or anything when I receive my shipment?\nA: No, you will not! We will have Spiral Galaxy Games in the UK fulfill this campaign for European backers, which means that, after we charge you for VAT through our pledge manager, we\u2019ll handle the payment processing for VAT and import duties on your reward. Then, Spiral Galaxy will ship all of your parcels out from within the EU and avoid any weird delays or further charges.\nQ: Where are you getting all of this information? It seems stupid and wrong and I don\u2019t like it.\nA: We talked to a lot of shipping companies, attorneys, and other professionals about the implications of EU law and how, exactly, VAT works. For a decent summary, the government of Finland has a pretty helpful website (and the information is, for the most part, broadly applicable across the EU).\nQ: Wait, but [insert other Kickstarter here] shipped stuff to Europe for way cheaper than this. Why can\u2019t you just do what they did?\nA: They either lost a ton of money on shipping, or they committed customs fraud, and we don\u2019t want to do either of those things. \nQ: Why do Norway and Switzerland have to follow these rules? They aren\u2019t in the EU!\nA: That is true! However, the customs regimes in Norway and Switzerland are very similar to those of the EU, by design.\nQ: What about Brexit?\nA: Brexit could complicate a lot of things, but what exactly it might complicate about this depends on the final form it takes. We\u2019ll cross that bridge if/when we come to it, and let you know about anything we wind up doing to work through it. Unfortunately, no one knows what will happen with Brexit, including Theresa May, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. If you have any secret information, please let us know. :)\nQ: I hate VAT; is there anything I can do about it?\nA: Us, too! Honestly, the only thing you can do is vote and call your local politicians. We\u2019ll do the same over here to see if we can avoid a long, stupid trade war.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is a fairly low-risk project. We are not unfamiliar with how to print books.

We noticed on our desk a number pad. Unappealing and boring. That\u2019s when we decided to experiment with it and just have fun. The Digit number pad is a retro-themed wireless mechanical number pad, which for sure will make you fall in love with numbers. So go ahead and spice up your workspace.  \nDigit number pads gives you the features of two products in just this one single product. It works as a number pad and a calculator. \nWith standard number row, there is plenty of scope of errors as it requires the fingers to travel a lot slowing down your productivity. The digit number pad is not only made to look good but also to increase productivity by bringing a great tactile response, sturdy mechanical keys making number inputs fun and spontaneous. \nYes, the Digit number pad is a calculator also. Solve your math problems with its stand alone mode and forget your phone. We promote less distraction and more productivity. You can also directly transfer the results to your computer, iPad or phone.  \nConnecting cables is just not our thing so we made it wireless. If that keeps you sane, go ahead, connect the wire. We have both the options. Wireless connectivity with bluetooth with just a few simple steps makes it super easy to use. It can also be used for 1 month after just a single charge.  Go wireless and get organized, be more productive and less distracted.  \nDigit number pad is part of our family and so it has taken over our family\u2019s unique design. It\u2019s inspired by the 1960\u2019s design style, retro, colorful and with quirky dot keycaps. It comes in three color variants, paired perfectly with our four season keyboard. \nGet a physical sensation of knowing that you are actually working. You can hear and feel the keycaps clicking against the pad as you crunch the numbers away, thanks to the Gateron key switches. \nHook up your laptop, iPad or phone at the same time and switch easily. Digit can connect with 3 different devices via the Bluetooth at the same time. \nDigit Number Pad enjoys 2 modes. Check what the Digit Number Pad is capable of:\nShort press the \u2018CALC\u2019 key to switch to calculator mode, and with a short press of \u2018NUM\u2019 key, you can switch between Number Pad Mode and Keyboard Mode. Super convenient and versatile.\nLED Backlight makes the key light up at night when you need extra assistance. With 2 backlights, your eyes can relax and work even late at night.

Although they share the same layout of keys, Digit Number Pad enjoys 2 modes - calculator and keyboard mode.

When pledging, just select the number of decks you want. You get to choose which designs you want in the backer survey we send out after the campaign is over. \nAir Deck 2.0 easily fits on small surfaces, such as a plane tray table\nAir Deck 2.0 is made with the same high-quality materials as the original, but we've made a couple of upgrades (apart from the new look):  \nOur new decks are designed so they\u2019re even more resilient to wear and tear.  \nThe boxes (including our current 1st generation Air Decks) are upgraded to .4mm waterproof synthetic paper, which makes them more durable than the .3mm we shipped with the original campaign. \nThe ink on the box is now more resistant to scratching.\nWe'll be planting mangrove trees to offset any CO2 emitted from production and shipping of the cards.\nThis time around we also offer stretch goals. Several other designs were also popular in our community feedback surveys. For us to be able to offer these, we need to reach a couple milestones:\nStretch goal #1 and #2 reached!\nThe idea for the original Air Deck was conceived by fellow globetrotters Ursus Negenborn and Rune Kippervik while traveling South East Asia. We love playing cards, and we just couldn\u2019t find a deck that was perfect for carrying at all times. As we\u2019re big fans of optimization, we decided to create the ultimate playing cards for travelers ourselves. \nThe Air Deck founders\nThe original Air Deck that started it all\nWith the Air Deck 2.0 we did not want to compromise on quality. We went to several of the world\u2019s best manufacturers of premium casino cards and asked for the best materials they could provide. In the process of creating the ultimate travel deck, we tried out over 50 different high-end plastic materials. The materials were taken through scratch, bending and handling tests to identify the best candidate. Finally, we ended up with a premium \u2018casino quality\u2019 PVC that has all the properties we want for our deck.\nWhile regular paper playing cards tear, stain, bend and break easily, Air Deck 2.0 is extremely durable\nThe cards grip nicely and have a premium feel\nThe Air Deck 2.0 takes up very little space and easily fits into your pocket\nThe Air Deck is incredibly resistant to tearing and bending, and is 100% waterproof. You can play with these in the pool, in the boat, in the tub, in the rain, at the beach, pretty much wherever you can think of. \nThe cards are 100% waterproof, so you can even use them in the pool or the bathtub\nIn the process of selecting the material we sought advice from several playing card professionals, to help us find the optimal material and design. The end result is a deck that shuffles and handles like you expect professional cards to do. The cards are slightly textured on on both sides to provide excellent handling.\nThe Air Deck 2.0 handles well and shuffles easily\nWe created the new designs for Air Deck 2.0 with the wonderful feedback we\u2019ve received from our community. \nWarp speed and Astronauts playing cards come with the same minimalist fronts as the original white decks. For our new classic design, we\u2019ve given the jack, queen, king and the joker a more traditional look. \nDespite their smaller width, the cards are as easy to read as a standard sized decks. The full-sized length ensures that it also handles much like a full size deck, and the narrower width makes the deck fit nicely in the palm of your hands.\nOur Classic design has traditional looking face cards\nWarp Speed and Astronauts Playing Cards have the same minimalist look as our original deck\nThe Air Deck 2.0 comes with a durable waterproof synthetic paper tuck box\nWe love traveling this beautiful blue ball we call home, and we believe we should care for it as best we can. There\u2019s only one earth after all. The Air Deck 2.0 is an environmentally conscious product to begin with, as it contains almost half the materials of its competitors. In addition, we\u2019ll also offset any CO2 that\u2019s emitted from the production and shipping of the project, by planting mangrove trees in Myanmar with Worldview International Foundation. Mangrove trees are pretty awesome, as they\u2019re one of the most effective tools to bind CO2 to the soil and prevent it from escaping into the atmosphere. They\u2019re ten times more effective than most other tree species, and as a bonus, they also help sustain coastal ecosystems, protect the shorelines from damage by storms and acts as a filter to maintain water quality. The more decks that gets pledged, the more trees will be planted. \nWe will plant mangrove trees with World View International Foundation\n\nThis project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 650+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $300MM raised between them.\nThis project is promoted by Green Inbox ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe designs of the cards have been finalized, and we\u2019ve made the prototypes you see in the video.

It performs better than nonstick pans that cost over $130, at a fraction of the price. No gimmicks. No BS marketing claims. Just premium, long-lasting performance at an honest price. \nWe love nonstick pans for cooking eggs and delicate foods, but they have always been a frustrating purchase for us. Because the truth is that ALL nonstick pans eventually stop working and start sticking when the coating wears off. There\u2019s no magic fix for this.\nPeople basically have two options: buy cheap nonstick pans that may last a few months or years at most, or expensive ones that may last a bit longer, but will still need to be replaced. Both options seemed pretty bad. So we decided to create something better.\nOur goal was simple. Create an insanely long-lasting and durable nonstick pan, and sell it for a price that\u2019s fair and affordable. We think we nailed it.\nSo how is it that we can make a nonstick pan that performs better than expensive ones which cost well over $100, and sell it for a fraction of that price? Simple. By cutting out traditional retail middlemen and selling directly to you online, we\u2019re able to offer incredible quality, at wholesale pricing \nPeople often ask how long nonstick pans last, and the true answer is \"it depends.\" The lifespan of a nonstick pan is not just related to the quality of the nonstick coating, but also to how frequently it's used and how it's cared for. \nWhat IS much clearer, is knowing when you need to replace your nonstick pan. Scratches. Sticking. Flakes. Hotspots. If your nonstick pan has any of these, it's time for an upgrade. \nBad Nonstick! Bad!\nThe Misen Nonstick System is made of two key parts: an industry leading, PFOA-Free Nonstick Coating, and an innovative Plasma Primer. Both elements work together to form a Nonstick System that is absurdly durable, and provides long-lasting performance.\nA good analogy for how nonstick coatings are applied is painting a wall. While the quality of the paint/coating and number of layers used matters, so too does does the primer, or how the wall/pan is prepared for accepting the paint/coating. This primer layer is a crucial and often overlooked element in making great nonstick. \nRather than using a traditional 'grit blasting' primer method, for the Misen Pan we decided to use an innovative Plasma Primer. Infused with Titanium, the Plasma Primer Layer is 2.5 times more effective than the traditional primers, and extends the hardness and abrasion resistance of nonstick coatings.\nPlasma Primer: How We Tested\nAdmittedly, we were skeptical when we heard about the very buzzword-y \"Plasma Primer.\" There are so many BS nonstick claims (\"it'll last forever!\") and infomercials, and we thought the Plasma Primer might be another gimmick. But after research, it seemed the the Plasma Primer was legit, and we wanted to test it out.\nWith the help of a low-profile shaking machine, we performed a series of forced abrasion tests meant to simulate long-term wear. We tested the Misen Nonstick Pan against many other nonstick pans without a Plasma Primer: Cheap Pans, Expensive Pans, and even Ceramic Pans. The Misen Nonstick Pan outperformed all of them.\nForced abrasion testing to simulate long-term wear\nIn forced abrasion testing, the Misen pan showed considerably less wear than other pans\nIn addition to the Plasma Primer, the second and equally important part of the Misen Nonstick System is...the nonstick coating itself! To again use a painting analogy, the quality of the paint/coating itself, and the number of coats/layers applied affect performance.\nFor our pan, we use Dupont's premier 3-Layer Platinum coating, modified to work even better with our Plasma Primer. This PFOA-Free coating is Dupont's most scratch and abrasion resistant nonstick finish, and is even designed to withstand normal metal utensils and abrasive scouring pads.\n(this was really fun)\nWe know safety is a major concern with nonstick pans, and dislike how many brands omit information about their nonstick, like what coating they use. We want you to be as informed as possible about the tools you're using to cook for yourself, your family, and your friends. To answer a common question of \"is nonstick safe?\", the short answer is yes. PTFE cookware is safe to cook with, but you should avoid very high temperatures. For more information and specifics, check out our FAQ.\nFor the base of our nonstick pan we used a 4.2 millimeter thick, commercial-grade aluminum construction. This thick base ensures a flat, even cooking surface for the life of your pan, and helps provide amazing heat distribution for better cooked foods.\nOn the bottom of our pan, we bonded a stainless steel plate to ensure it's compatible with any heat source. Gas, induction, electric - they all work. \n4.2MM thick aluminum base provides even heat distribution\nA Quick Rant! Many brands claim their nonstick pans are 100% dishwasher safe, and that you can use metal utensils on them. This is terrible advice! While doing either once in a while won't kill your pan, over time they wear your nonstick pan down faster. Don't do it!\nIt\u2019s important your pan feels comfortable and balanced while in use. The Misen Nonstick Pan has a cast stainless steel handle, riveted to the base for a strong, reliable connection that will last. The pan also features a removable stay-cool silicone grip with a textured underside for incredible comfort and control.\nPan heats up. Handle stays cool.\nThe design process will always be at the heart of Misen. Lovingly obsessing over every single consideration of a product is pure joy for us, and it was no different this time around. After countless sketches, prototypes, testing, and an unholy amount of eggs cooked (the smell...), we knew we had a nonstick pan that was truly special. \nCheesy Ending :)", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our third Kickstarter Campaign, and with each successive project we've launched, we've made a point to be farther along in development and ready for production.

Sporkatula? Foonula? We couldn't decide, so we decided to call it Morsel. \nWe wanted to design a better utensil that solved all the shortcomings we saw in conventional sporks and camping utensils. And after a year of serious sporking, we think we've succeeded.\nSquishy but not sticky, for easy scraping on any surface.\n      Eating should never be the crux of an adventure, so our goal is to make eating just a little bit easier, no matter what you're eating out of.\nScrape every last bit of food, every single time. More food in your stomach, less cleaning, and less waste.\nMorsel's long length is perfect for scraping every last bit of food from your Mountain House meal without getting your hands dirty.\nSometimes length matters.\n      Morsel is designed to be more versatile and useful than other utensils. Simply put, it's designed to work better.\nPro Tip: Morsel is a perfect gift for anyone who eats food.\n     Stretch goals are additional goals in case we exceed our original funding target - like if (by some miracle) Morsel goes viral on the interwebs.\nWe have a bunch of wild ideas for spin-off products, and if our campaign is successful enough we'll be able to bring them to life too. Ideas like...\nCool Colors - Get a spork to match your style\nMorsel Mini - Same spork, smaller size\nMorsel Spoon - For the spooning purist\nDo you dig it? Well the only way we'll reach these stretch goals is if you help us spread the word. So please, tell your friends about Morsel. If not for us, then do it for the adorable little Morsel Mini.\nBy supporting Morsel's Kickstarter, you are helping us fund the injection molds and food-grade materials needed to order our first batch and make Morsel a reality.\nBut more than that, you're helping support a couple of freelance inventors who have spent an entirely unfathomable amount of time and energy designing... a really cool spork.\nMorsel Spork is just the start. We want to continue creating innovative and functional culinary contraptions - ones that work equally well for the discerning outdoorsy person, the family picnicker, or the van-dwelling vagabond.\nWe're here to shake up the spork industry, and you're invited.\nWe're two Portland-based product designers trying to bootstrap our way into spork production. We've already collaborated on a bunch of cool freelance design projects, and as individuals we've each successfully launched and fulfilled crowdfunding campaigns. Over the last decade we both worked in product engineering and creative design environments, and are experts at turning napkin sketches into real things (for realsies).\nZac | Website\nAlex | Portfolio | Website\nIt started with a simple idea: to make a spork with a rubber edge.\nZac just wasn't satisfied with the sporks on the market. He vented to Alex about how camping sporks were all basically the same, and they all sorta sucked at being used as eating utensils. He wanted something that would fit any shape - which led to the idea of having a soft, rubbery spoon.\nThis was probably the first of Zac's countless silly product ideas that had genuinely piqued Alex's interest. The whole product could be simple, elegant, and functional - and they felt that previous attempts at reinventing the spork had fallen short of what a spork could truly be.\nThey agreed to tackle the Ultimate Spork Project, and set to work. Following a traditional product design process, they began by examining all the things they did and didn't like about current spork tech. They started dreaming of all the ways they could impove the spork. And they spent beer-fueled nights sketching concepts on post-it notes, sorting ideas, and evaluating manufacturing risks and feasibilty for different concepts.\nAfter a lot of heated discussion, emotions, and coffee, they started to focus in on a general design plan. From there, they spent countless hours sketching and hand-carving sleek models out of foam, creating 3d-printed concepts, and working on the design's functionality and manufacturability.\nThe quest for a better spork was on.\nWe started making a list of all the other little things that annoyed us about conventional sporks. Things like...\nTiny, barely-functional fork tines\nSpoons that drip liquids\nHandles that break too easily\nHandles too short for deep food bags\nWe wanted to address all these common spork complaints, while blending the solutions into a single, elegant utensil. One that functioned as well as any normal kitchen cutlery, and one that didn't feel like a compromise.\nOur designs evolved, literally, into a complex asymmetric shape that allows for continuous contact, whether digging into tight corners, or scraping along the surfaces of big bowls.\nWe've crafted countless prototypes from clay, foam, and plastic, and we've bought fancy 3d-prints to validate and test our design.\nMorsel is the result a year and a half of spork-centric obsession. A quest to create the rad, versatile utensil that we always secretly wanted, and you never knew you needed - until now.\nAs a couple of product design perfectionists, we're proud of what Morsel has become - an expression of form that makes no sacrifices in function.\nOr, in the words of a random internet person...\n     We still need your help to spread the word. If you think Morsel is a cool product, please, tell your friends, and share Morsel on social media.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nBoth as a team and as individual professionals, we have been integral to countless product design efforts over the last decade.

What if the story depended on the choices YOU made? \nSound familiar? You've probably heard of game books where you get to choose your path by reading a series of text paragraphs each ending with a fun choice. But what if...\nWhat if a game book implemented GRAPHICS into the game play? What if instead of text driving the action, text AND graphics combined to create a visual sensory experience?\nI'd like to introduce you to the next evolution of game books: \nThe Ultimate Solitaire Game Experience\nI'll be straight up with you. We keep current with the Solitaire Gaming Community. After all, we have one of the most popular and successful solitaire board games on the market in Hostage Negotiator and catering to solo gamers is one of our core brand strategies. I am telling you right now these books are an incredible Solitaire experience. And they are so accessible even to those of you that don't normally play games solo. \nThere is zero setup time. Open the book and begin playing. Start and stop at will, play time is whatever you want it to be.\nThey tell a cohesive and engaging story.\nThey include puzzles, riddles, hidden numbers, and other challenges that will test you at every step.\n\"I need a game to play on an airplane tray table\" - you cannot imagine how often we hear this from the solo community. Look no further!\nThe books feature a variety of themes and story lines each with different rules and gameplay twists on the core system.\nOk  I'll throw my personal opinion in here. This is the BEST game book experience I have EVER had and it is hard for me to imagine going back to text based game books after this. And I've played all the greats like CYOA, Lone Wolf, Fighting Fantasy, Sorcery!, and more.\nStill not convinced? Let's take a peek inside... \nLooking at your character sheet, you'll decide how to split your 20 skill points between Strength, Dexterity, and Will. As you experience the book and fail the first few times, you will learn what configurations might be better than others. \n                   Now that you are ready let's skip to the end of the intro (watch the project video for the full intro if you prefer)...\nAha! Your first choice!\nWhich way will you go to start your adventure?\nThe rest of the frames in the book from this point forward have choices of where to go and what to do. You'll encounter foes, puzzles, traps, riddles, and much, much more! You'll need to hurry as time is tracked as you go... Don't move too fast though! You don't want to miss spotting a hidden number that could be critical to your objective... \nCan YOU spot the hidden number in the frame below? (Don't worry, the below frame is from the intro and is modified. This is not an actual hidden number in the book - as to not spoil anything)\nOk this one was simple, the real thing won't be so easy!\nIf this was real and not just a made up example, you would flip to frame 27 and perhaps discover the villain was holding something important in his hand. \nI can tell you want MORE! Well to experience the adventure you are going to have to pledge for these books. But let's look at the other four in the set, shall we?\nThe sacred sprouts known as \"the tears of Nuwa\" have been stolen by 3 thieves. You are a bounty hunter hired to track them down and return the sprouts before the apocalypse is unleashed! And make a bit of money in the process...\nYou'll choose your primary skill... are you a master burglar? A master of disguise? Or proficient with thrown weapons? Choose one and grab your deadly poisons because adventure awaits!\n                  Here is the map of the city you'll see when you start your adventure. Which district will you visit first? With book in hand you will simply turn to the frame where you want to go!\n Will you find the Goddess' Tears and save the world?\n If you don't know what Loup Garou means, here's a hint...\nYep, it means Werewolf (it's French). You've been bitten and you are now a young werewolf. You'll have to learn to control your powers if you are going to find your master and solve the mysterious events going on in the town of Whitehorn. You'll choose your profession and, using the skill tree, gain new abilities as you level up throughout the game!\nThere is a lot of info here, don't strain your eyes trying to read it! We will cover it in more detail in a project update.\n       Loup Garou features combat!  You will fight monsters, creatures, human enemies and other foes! Like this Ghoul! (frame number and info removed as to not spoil anything)\n Defeat your foes to gain valuable Experience Points (XP) and Loot!\n\nEver wondered what it was like to be the mayor of a small town in the wild west? Well here's your chance to find out...\nNo one said it was gonna be easy though! You'll build buildings on a map to earn income, create jobs, attract new citizens, and gain a whole host of other benefits (and sometimes consequences) to help you manage the critical aspects of town! \n     Your Town is the most complex of the 5 books and will take tons of smarts. Can you manage the town as a successful mayor? Or will you fail yourself and the townspeople who are depending on you?\nIt will take every bit of intuition and deductive reasoning you can muster to solve the cases in this one! \nChoose to play as Dr. John Watson or as Sherlock himself. The unique system allows you to play over and over without learning the solutions of each case until you have successfully solved them. But will you be able to ignore your curiosity and play through it again without looking at the solutions?\nYou'll question many suspects along the way... but will you ask the right questions? Will your observation skills be up to the task? (Don't worry! The frame below has been modified and all text changed as to not spoil anything)\nUse your instincts, your intuition, and most of all - your brains, to solve the Four Investigations!\n________________________________________________________________\nIf you aren't excited about these books by now then we are shocked! Quite frankly, we don't want it to end with these books! If this campaign is successful, we will be bringing you even more of these books in the future!\nStill don't believe us? We sent preview copies of Captive out. Let's see what others are saying...\nListen, if you are a genius and lucky enough to get through one of these books on the first try, well then we bow to you (unless you cheated). But the chances are if you are playing legit, it will take you at least a handful of tries to complete one. You are looking at several hours of game play in each book. Think a bit like something similar to Time Stories in book form a bit. Not to mention each book has a point system of achievements you can try to accomplish. And these books are the sort where you can put them on the shelf for a year or several months and you'll be able to revisit them again unless you've got one of those photographic memories where you never forget anything! \nThe retail cost per book will be $22.95, so by choosing any of the below pledges you'll be receiving a significant savings. Choose the full set to get the best possible deal!\nConcerned about shipping cost? Grab a few friends and add additional copies at the same pledge price for each copy. Additional full sets can be added without any additional shipping expense! For example, if you add 3 sets of books for a total of 4, you still only pay shipping as if you ordered just 1 set! \nLimited advanced shipping opportunity for USA backers! We will be shipping some books by Air Freight to make sure we have product available (at full retail) for the Origins Convention in early June. If you would like your rewards delivered early, you can select the Advanced shipping opportunity for an extra $15. We expect these copies will be able to be delivered 3-4 weeks before the main shipping estimated in June. Limit one set per backer, additional sets are not allowed due to limited space.\nWe MAY add more quantities to the Advanced shipping level depending on Demand and availability to do so.\nGraphic Novel Adventures are self-contained games within a book and are English translations we are printing under license of previously released French game books from publisher Makaka Editions. As a result, we will not be offering stretch goals for this campaign. However it should be noted that the more we achieve with this campaign, the greater likelihood we will be able to translate and produce MORE Graphic Novel Adventures! \n\"When will the books be delivered?\" \nGet this... files have already been provided to our manufacturer. They are standing by with their hand on the button. So we are planning to be able to deliver these books at lightning speed and are targeting June for our delivery estimate. We just need to hit the funding amount and then we say go!\nWe are offering retailer pledges for USA/Canada retailers that are interested in purchasing 4 or more sets of the books each including the slipcase. Simply back for $1 and send a message to the project creator to validate yourself as a retailer and get our retailer-only pricing. Then, prior to shipping from the factory we will ask you to finalize your quantity commitment, but you can pay at a later date prior to final shipping. We will verify all retailers! \nAuthor and Illustrator Credits (note many use nicknames):\nCaptive - Author: Manuro / Illustrator: MC\nTears of a Goddess - Author: Manuro / Illustrator: Ben Jurdic / Inks: Damien Gay / Translation: Adam Marostica\nLoup Garou - Author: Moon / Ilustrator: 2D / Translation: JF Gagn\u00e9\nYour Town - Author: Shuky / Illustrator: 2D / Translation: JF Gagn\u00e9\nSherlock Holmes: 4 Investigations - Author and Illustrator: CED / Translation: Adam Marostica", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nVan Ryder Games has successfully funded and fulfilled several projects.

Ultimately, these games would be judged by a group of playtesters and independent judges, and an overall winner would be chosen to be presented on Kickstarter and added to the Rabbit line of small Dice Hate Me Games titles. We figured we might get 30 or 40 entries.\nWe got 108.\nSo, as Rabbits are wont to do, they started multiplying. One winner became four. Two other Rabbits popped up that simply couldn't be ignored. And, now, here we are with six amazing games that are yearning to be published and find a place on your gaming table. This is their story.\nThis thematic three-pack featuring food and fine libations happened organically during the process of determing the winner of the 54-Card Challenge. Details of each game in the three-pack are below; for more information, including interviews with the designers, check this out.\nDiner, by designer Matthew O'Malley, was the grand prize-winning entry in the 54-Card Challenge. In this fast-paced game, players take on the role of waitstaff in a friendly competition to make the most money in tips. Take orders for the tables in your section, gather the plates to fill those orders, serve your tables, and do it as quickly as possible while showing up the others.\nDiner features a pseudo-real-time mechanic that has players passing action tokens whenever they take an action; if a player does not have a token, that player can't take an action. At times, action tokens may accumulate in front of a player, allowing them to take multiple actions at once. For 2 to 4 players, about 10-15 minutes. (Download the rules)\nBen Rosset\u2019s Brew Crafters Travel Card Game is a 54-card game based on the big-box Euro Brew Crafters that was Kickstarted last fall by Dice Hate Me Games. Brew Crafters TCG was not an official entry in the 54-Card Challenge, but after its mass appeal and widespread acclaim at Unpub 4, it proved worthy of becoming a Rabbit.\nJust as in its big-box brother, players in Brew Crafters TCG are trying to manage their craft breweries by hiring workers, installing equipment or using cards to brew craft beers. For 2 to 4 players, 20-30 minutes. (Download the rules)\nBryan Fischer (co-designer of Chicken Caesar, and one of the heads of Nevermore Games) has been working on the design for Pie Factory for the past couple of years, and approached Dice Hate Me Games about publishing his delicious little title long before the 54-Card Challenge. \nAs workers in a pie factory, players are competing for the big promotion to be announced in two days' time. In order to be selected, players must box the most value in pies and influence the higher-ups to choose them. Pie Factory's heart and soul is the Assembly Line mechanic from which players draft ingredients for their pies. Each ingredient takes a certain amount of time to prepare and player order is rearranged each round to reflect time taken, so players must time their actions just right to make sure they get the ingredients they most want. This is the one where grandma will crush everyone at the table \u2014 we've seen it far too many times. For 2 to 4 players, about 30 minutes. (Download the rules)\nThis thematic three-pack features thrilling adventures on two separate islands and exotic locations around the US \u2014 or at least a waiting room in Sheboygan, Wisconsin. Details of each game in the three-pack are below; for more information, including interviews with the designers, check this out.\nJ. Alex Kevern's Easy Breezy Travel Agency was awarded first runner-up in the Dice Hate Me 54-Card Challenge, and for good reason: Along with Diner, it was a certified crowd-pleaser, with players walking away from the game still talking about it hours later.\nSet in Sheboygan of 1974, Easy Breezy has players acting as travel agents trying their best to provide tickets for customers going to one of four locations: New Orleans, New York, Chicago and Miami. As customers line up in the queue, certain fares will rise in price, creating a greater demand and, in turn, a greater commission for the agent that is able to provide the ticket. The hand limit comes into play heavily in this game, and players will often have to put some of their customers into their waiting area \u2014 an area in front of them where other players might be able to coax travelers over to their ticket counter. For 2 to 4 players, 20-30 minutes. (Download the rules)\nGraham Russell's The Fittest tied for second runner-up in the 54-Card Challenge, and was certainly the best of the social games in the competition. In The Fittest, you've been selected for the most rigorous, cutthroat reality competition on TV. As a contestant, you\u2019ll compete in challenges and work with and against the other competitors for a shot at fame and fortune. You won\u2019t win if you go it alone, but don\u2019t get too friendly; you\u2019ll have to do a bit of backstabbing to emerge victorious.\nThe Fittest features fierce social play and shifting alliances. Players will have to evaluate a challenge each round and convince other players to work with them in order to best the challenge for variable rewards. The player who has best managed their alliances and achieved the best rewards at the end of the game will be the victor. For 4 to 6 players, 30 to 45 minutes. (Download the rules)\nDan Keltner & Seth Jaffee's Isle of Trains was tied for second runner-up with The Fittest, and was possibly the most strategic Rabbit in the competition.\nIn this little Euro card game that could, players are train operators, building trains with the right mix of freight cars needed to complete delivery contracts before their opponents. Cards are used in multiple ways: they can be built as train cars or buildings supporting your train line, used as currency to pay the cost of building those new train cars and buildings, or used as cargo to load on available train cars.\nWhen loading cargo on an opponent\u2019s train, players receive an immediate benefit or action, but they are also giving their opponent the cargo they just might need to be able to complete a delivery contract and score big! Balancing the need to upgrade your train, take advantage of benefits from loading other players' trains, and complete delivery contracts first is the key to being the most successful train operator on the Isle of Trains. For 2 to 4 players, 30 to 45 minutes. (Download the rules)\nWe're funded! Achieving our base funding goal ensures that Dice Hate Me Games is able to publish these six games at the quality you have all come to expect from our products. Each game will feature quality, durable card stock with robust color, and come in custom tuck boxes with full color art.\nWe've reached $30,000 in funding! This means we will upgrade the card stock to a fine, French linen and be able to provide slightly larger, two-part boxes for each game. You can see pictures of the box bottom with insert and a close-up of the linen finish below.\nWe've also passed our second stretch goal of $36K! We are now able to add tokens to Diner and Brew Crafters Travel Card Game!\nAnd now we've reached our next stretch goal of $42,000! Now we can do a little something special for the backers: Custom wooden nickels to be used as action tokens in Diner. These will not be in the box, and are only available to backers and as convention promotionals.\nWe've reached our final milestone - $50K! That means that everyone who gets The Fittest will also receive a tiki totem pendant that signifies the leader for each Episode (round of the game)! Like the Diner nickels, this Leader Totem will not be in the box, but available to backers and as convention promotionals only.\nThanks so much to all of our wonderful backers for helping us to add some great value to these games! \nDice Hate Me Games titles are broken down into five categories based on both box size and, typically, depth of play. The line is made up of Rabbits (smallest, typically simplest games), Monkeys, Roosters, Tigers, and Dragons (our biggest and most complex - yet to come). As mentioned, the Rabbits are our smallest games, and typically have the simplest rules and fastest play times.\nSome examples of each category are The Great Heartland Hauling Co. (Monkey), Compounded (Rooster), and VivaJava: The Coffee Game (Tiger).\nNo doubt about it, I have had a love affair with card games since long before I learned how to properly shuffle a deck when I should have been studying in college. There's just something magical about playing a good, classic card game with friends and family until that deck is well-worn and well-loved.\nWhen I first envisioned this project, it was to be a modest effort at capturing a bit of that magic while engaging the game design community in creating something special. I had no idea that the design community would rally to make not only the games special, but also the entire process. It's been challenging, at times, but seeing the enthusiasm and creativity that has poured forth from so many aspiring designers has been absolutely breathtaking. \nI do want to stress that these card games are not what most would consider modern microgames; they are designed with the aesthetic of many classic 54-card games - portable and easy to play, but also with a rich depth that will reward players every time each game hits the table. I am more than proud to present these six designs to all of you, dear backers. Keep on shufflin'.\nAll the best,\nChris", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs with any project that involves the production and manufacture of a good to be delivered, there is certainly a real chance for hiccups, delays and more than one or two gremlins gumming up the works along the way. Many boardgame projects on Kickstarter have been seriously hampered by art production delays, problems with an overseas factory, missing units and one shipping snafu after another.\n\nLuckily, we have a few projects under our belt, and have dealt with many of those snafus and gremlins along the way. We have a good working relationship with two of our overseas manufacturers and have become accustomed to their protocols, communication styles and general idiosyncrasies. We try to plan for all contingencies, and we've been fairly successful with that in our past projects.\n\nWe've learned a lot these past couple of years. The last three Dice Hate Me Games projects \u2014 VivaJava: The Coffee Game: The Dice Game, Belle of the Ball, and Brew Crafters \u2014 were successfully funded this summer and fall, respectively, and are currently in production. Things are going smoothly with the projects, so far \u2014 VivaJava Dice and Belle of the Ball are in the late stages of physical production and are just about ready to head out on the boat, and Brew Crafters is nearing final file completion - but they still fall well within the risks and challenges category since there are many steps in the production process. We are vigilant and resourceful, however, and will keep on top of these projects while we promote and prepare these card games for a hopeful production run. We're multitasking like maniacs, but we promise the same quality as our other successful Kickstarters. Besides, the art for The Rabbits is almost complete, so we should be able to jump into full production shortly after the campaign wraps.\n\nWe won't lie - stuff happens. Delays can occur. Sometimes you have to go back and forth on color samples six times just to get the color right, and even then the color isn't perfect. But what we do promise is that we will hold ourselves to the same high standards we expect from other board game publishers, and we will be completely honest and open with each of you every step of the way.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #27", "update_userinfo": "Warren Report #27", "update_content": "Greetings card gamers!\nHappy April 1st!

Visit us at www.dbl-dbl.com to pre-order your SipSnap.\nFollow us on:\nFacebook \nTwitter\nPinterest\nSipSnap TOT and SipSnap KID\nSipSnaps are a patent pending invention by Sativa Turner and Michelle Ivankovic. They are BPA- and Phthalate-free. Made from the best quality silicone available, they pass the most rigid food safety testing standards. SipSnaps are dishwasher safe.\nChoose ANY tumbler, stretch SipSnap over the top of it, and you\u2019ve got a spill-proof cup to hand to your kid. Take your kids to a restaurant, party, friend\u2019s house, etc., without worrying they\u2019ll spill. SipSnaps aren\u2019t just for parents. If you\u2019ve got friends with kids, own a restaurant, run a daycare, or just have some little relatives that occasionally visit, keeping some SipSnaps around can come in quite handy. We\u2019ve made two versions:\nSipSnap TOT has a durable, chew-resistant spout for little ones to drink from.\nThe outline indicates where SipSnap is co-molded with a harder chew-resistant silicone.\nThe SipSnap Kid changes shape to form around cups or fold down for compactness when storing.\nSipSnap KID fits all sizes of cups and straws. The straw hole is flexible, because straws are different everywhere you go.\nAny Cup, Anytime, Anywhere.\nThe elasticity in the silicone allows you to stretch SipSnap over any cup (without handles) making it a universal spill-proof lid.\nFits all size cups from the largest to the smallest.\nSpill-Proof\nThe elastic flexibility and strength of the silicone ensure a tight fit around any cup. Whether your kid knocks it over or walks around with it upside down, you can feel safe knowing that although a couple of drops may escape you won\u2019t end up with a puddle of liquid.\nThe silicone grips to the cup very tightly, so even with the weight of liquid contents it will not come off.\nSipSnaps catch and stop the giant spills that are experienced when cups are knocked over\nRoll-Stop Bumper\nWhen cups get knocked over they can roll off the table and onto a dirty floor. We\u2019ve incorporated a roll stop feature in the rim of SipSnaps so they can\u2019t get far.\nSets of 3\nEach pack comes as a set of 3 so you can be sure to always have one with you wherever you are.\nNow that's smart storage! 6 SipSnaps use the footprint of 1 cup in your kitchen. You can even store them in a utensil drawer.\nSpace Saving\nSipSnaps have a live hinge to fold compact. Each set comes with one carry case so you can keep things clean on the go.\nFacilitates Bottle to Cup Transition\nBy using SipSnap on real cups your kids can get comfortable with holding different sized cups with different weights without making a mess.\nAllows for Material Choice\nPlastic, glass, ceramic, metal\u2026 Easily control the material your kid drinks from. When your children are young you may wish to stay away from breakable materials, but as they gain more control you can expand your material options.\nEnvironmentally Responsible\nWith SipSnaps you can use the cups you already own.\nThe TOT and KID versions can both fit over threaded jars for additional environmental goodness.\nNo Extra Parts\nSipSnaps are simple. With no extra parts to lose they\u2019re always in working order.\n Stretch Goal - Free Rewards!\nIf we reach our stretch goal of $90,000 we will be able to give extra free rewards with each set. Each set of KID will come with a stainless steel straw and each set of TOT will come with an extra carrying case - that's 2 cases per set!\nRewards:\nIf we achieve our funding goal we will send out a survey at the end of our campaign to all supporters to select KID or TOT versions and color palette.\nAdd-On Rewards!!!

She received her degree in product design from Stanford University, learning from many of America\u2019s contemporary design legends. Her career has taken her around the world, beginning with an apprenticeship in Berlin. From there she went on to work for Umbra in Toronto and Enesco in Chicago. She is now back in San Francisco where she is developing her skills as a designer entrepreneur. Her previous Kickstarter experience is as the founder of Whooz, a clever and fun way of identifying your smart device chargers so they don\u2019t get lost. Sativa is a creative thinker who supports her ideas with serious analysis and technical know-how. She is passionate about play and believes that being a parent holds every bit as much wonder as being a child. With SipSnap she hopes to ease the lives of parents so that they can enjoy the adventures of parenting. She looks forward to her greatest creation yet with the birth of her first child.\nMichelle Ivankovic is an industrial designer and mother of two wonderfully wild children. She\u2019s cleaned up her fair share of spills and is excited to combine her passion for design and love for her family in the creation of SipSnap. Michelle studied design at the Ontario College of Art and Design and went on to work at Umbra in Toronto as lead designer and creative visionary. She has created some of the home d\u00e9cor industry\u2019s most iconic designs and achieved numerous accolades and awards such as inclusion in the Cooper Hewitt\u2019s permanent collection and I.D. Magazine\u2019s top 100 designs of 2008. Michelle has a skill for creating beautiful, intuitive designs that easily find a permanent place in our homes and hearts. She now works out of her studio, developing designs for exhibition, and co-directing Food Huggers, her first Kickstarter campaign.\nAs Seen In\nThank you\nAndrew Cloutier, our friend and totally awesome graphic designer.\nAdrienne McNicholas, Michelle's partner at Food Huggers, always delivering smiles and bang-on advice.\nErik Urlings, for directing and editing our video and making it a great experience. \nTunella and Carol, and your beautiful children.\nDejan Kamenski and Suze Gardner, supporters extraordinaire.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is, collectively, our third Kickstarter Project. We have successfully delivered two high quality products with great reviews\u2014Food Huggers and Whooz. We have tested and iterated our prototypes to find the right form and ideal elasticity. Sam and Kevin are the wonderful guys behind the manufacturing; they are experts in manufacturing quality baby and toddler drinking spouts. They have been great at helping achieve the exact right technical specs on the materials and forms to ensure that we are fully ready to go to tooling. With two kickstarters under our belt we know what what needs to happen to ship the SipSnaps to your door.\n\nWait, didn\u2019t we say Sativa has a baby on the way? Experienced mom friend Michelle knows what to do. Michelle has carried well over 50 projects through the manufacturing phase in her highly active career and has carefully planned out the production and delivery for SipSnap with the help of an assistant. We feel quite confident that our preparations and partners will result in a great production with minimal risks. Each project is unique so we have added extra time in our estimated delivery to account for the unforeseen hiccups. \n\nSafety is the number one most important issue to us and we will be taking the time to make sure all testing requirements for child and food products are completed to the highest standards.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #21", "update_userinfo": "SipSnap teams up with Boon!", "update_content": "Happy Thanksgiving\nAs this week begins and we reunite with friends and family to think about all we are grateful for, we are reminded of you, our wonderful backers.

I have requested more samples to touch and determine full range of options.\n----\nHelp enhance a global icon.  Throughout the world, the classic six-sided dice (d6) symbolize not only gaming, but also play and luck. \nSome say dice originated from the ankle bones of hoofed animals. But once the die developed into the pipped cube, the d6 stopped evolving.\nIsn't it time for a new spin on a classic? By making the d6 a dodecahedron, the die will not only roll better, but be more weight-balanced as opposing sides have the same number of engraved pips.\nDoublesix Dice can also be the perfect gateway accessory: Swap in your Doublesixes for the stale dice in your non-gamer friends' games (like Monopoly and Backgammon), and soon they will be wanting to take on Advanced D&D.\nIf you pledge to get your own Doublesix Dice and help this humble intiative, I pledge to provide you, in return, detailed transparency of the process, and satisfaction guaranteed (or your money back).\nWe will start with Black engraved pips on Ivory. Other colors will be added as stretch goals.\nHere are some preliminary details:\nWhy $3246?\n\nProduction: $2000\nShipping: approx $1000\nFees (Kickstarter at 5% and Amazon at about 3.2%): $246\nNot included:\nLogo design: $299 (via 99designs.com, where you can help vote for the final design)\nAdvertising on Boardgame Geek: $500\nGift to Ronald Larson (expired patent holder): $300\nVirtual Assistance: $300 +\nPRODUCTION\nThese 19mm ivory-colored acrylic dice will be custom molded with engraved pips painted black. Current likely producer: Ningbo Lijia Industry Co (they specialize in game components) http://www.cnlijia.com.cn/\nCost of mold: $1300.\nCost of minimum production run (10k units): $700\nCost per dice (first 10K including cost of mold): $0.20\nWholesale cost per dice: $0.40\nMSRP: $0.80\n\nI used the wholesale cost to calculate the reward tiers.\nPer order of 12 dice:\nCost for dice: $4.80\nCost per envelop (bubble mailer): $1.49\nCost to ship in US: approx $2.50\nCost to handle (ie. pack and label): $0.25\nKS and Amaz fees: $0.82\nTotal cost: approx $9.86\nSHIPPING TO CANADA AND MEXICO: Kickstarter groups Canada and Mexico in their \"to ship Outside the US\" additional cost in the reward tiers, though it is cheaper. I plan to compensate Canadians and Mexican somehow (likely extra dice).\nINTELLECTUAL PROPERTY\nThough I thought of the idea myself, I discovered an expired patent (filed in 1982) on the exact same idea:\nhttp://www.google.com/patents/US4465279\n\nAs a measure of good faith, I had originally planned to donate 10% of the Kickstarter goal amount ($300) to the original patent holder, Roland Larson (or his charity of choice), if we were successful.  EDIT: Turns out that Kickstarter forbids this, so this will not be happening.\nBecause the patent is expired, no one, including myself, can patent the idea again, so it is fair game to all.  Therefore, others can start producing d2x6, and probably will.  However, there will be the one and only original brand: Doublesix Dice.\nPROTOTYPES\nThanks to Eric (http://www.ericharshbarger.org/) for making the prototypes for the video (he used blank dice from Chessex manufacturing and engraved them with a laser cutter).\nClick Kicktraq image below to track this project's trending.\nADD-ONS and COLORS:\nWill be $5 for a 6-pack.

In order to ensure that they stay one step ahead of the other hosts, players will have to carefully watch the growing line of guests at the door, inviting those in that seem to share passions with partygoers already inside, all the while handing out their precious stash of Regrets to those who should seek delight elsewhere. Of course, other hosts may find it advantageous to invite a rejected guest inside just to collect their accumulated Regrets for later use. \nHosts may also choose to ignore the competition for guests and instead try to earn the favor of the Belle herself - the muse of the festivities whose mirth, mischief or mayhem can make or break any party.\nThe cards and components will be of the same high quality as in Carnival and The Great Heartland Hauling Co. The box size will also be the same, so you can easily take it with you to your next soiree!\nBelle of the Ball is a game for 2 to 4 party-goers, ages 10 and up, and designed by Daniel Solis. You can learn more about Daniel's design process, as well as the full development life of Belle of the Ball, on Daniel's personal design blog.\nBelle of the Ball will feature a ton of cards, most with unique and stunning art from award-winning artist Jacqui Davis. Here's what you'll find inside every copy of Belle:\n- 60 Guest cards, representing five representatives each of the 12 counties of Ludobel. Each guest card is unique - that means 60 different character portraits from Jacqui!\n- 27 Belle cards that describe a certain action that the Belle can perform, divided into three categories: Mirth, Mischief and Mayhem. Players can use all three categories or mix and match to create a custom gaming experience!\n- 3 double-sided score cards for tracking how well each players' party is faring during the game.\n- 8 wooden scoring discs in four player colors - and more, with use on special scoring cards, are planned if we reach our stretch goals!\nIf you'd like to dig deeper into Belle of the Ball, you can download the simple rules here. If you have the time and wherewithal, you can also download the full Print and Play files with the rules for the base game right over here. Just bear in mind that we're still refining things a bit to make sure they are the best and clearest they can be. The final rulebook will also contain variants and advanced scoring for the more hardcore partiers! We can also make the rulebook larger to incorporate some expansion ideas that have been in development for awhile - if funding for our party goes well!\nBelle of the Ball takes place on the magical Victorian isle of Ludobel - a wondrous place filled with rich history and loads of whimsical characters. The guests that players invite to their parties are comprised of residents from one of 12 counties on the island. The attire, title, and sometimes even the name of each guest reflect the culture and contributions of each county. \nDesigner Daniel Solis likes a good story and his award-winning work on Happy Birthday, Robot, Do: Pilgrims of the Flying Temple and numerous other role-playing and storytelling projects are reflected in the tales of Ludobel. Look for project updates that will feature more about the counties, people and history of this wondeful isle!\nDice Hate Me Games has been blessed with some of the best backers on Kickstarter. The enthusiasm and support of those backers have made it possible to not only produce our card games Carnival and The Great Heartland Hauling Co., but also to quickly sell out of the initial print runs. Honestly, if we had known, we'd have ordered more! But, that's the nature of the business - sometimes you have to be cautiously optimistic.\nSince we've had such demand for both games since selling out, we thought that the Kickstarter campaign for Belle of the Ball would be a perfect opportunity to fund a second print run for both titles. Since they are all produced by the same manufacturer, we will be able to combine production times and shipping, cutting costs and getting all three titles to the market at the same time.\nWith each of your pledges to Belle of the Ball you are essentially lending your support for the birth and rebirth of three games - so now you can feel three times as good for being so awesome to us!\nAchieving our base funding goal ensures that we're able to produce Belle of the Ball (and Carnival and The Great Heartland Hauling Co.) at the quality that you've come to expect from Dice Hate Me Games. Now that we've reached overfunding, we have some cool ideas to expand the game!\nOur first stretch goal for $30,000 has been reached! We're now able to introduce a whole new set of guests... who weren't invited to the party! These party crashers are Grifters who don't call any particular county in Ludobel home, but prefer to wander about from party to party, spreading their particular brand of mischief. For more information about the Grifters, please see project update #2!\nSince this campaign is also a way for Kickstarter backers to pledge for Carnival and The Great Heartland Hauling Co., we also have a stretch goal just for them - and we've reached it! Since we've hit $35,000 in funds, every copy of Carnival will include the Sideshow expansion and every copy of The Great Heartland Hauling Co. will include The Badlands 5th player expansion! More info. on these expansions can be found in project update #2. \nOur $40K stretch goal is a very special \"inspansion\" for Belle of the Ball! We can now include the County Pride variant card inspansion - a set of 12 double-sided cards representing the 12 counties of Ludobel that introduce variable player powers and advanced ways to score!\nThe image above is just a sampling of the County Pride cards, and you can find more info. on this inspansion in Project Update #4. We'll be unveiling more County Pride cards, including information about the various Counties and their rich culture and history, over the course of the campaign.\nWe've reached our next stretch goal at $48K! This one is a tad smaller than the County Pride inspansion, component-wise, but definitely not in scope. We'll be adding two more features to Belle of the Ball: A special Belle's Favor variant card and more scoring discs to allow players to play the \"Epic\" variant and add a 5th player while playing in \"Classic\" mode! Be sure to check out all the details on this stretch goal in Project Update #7!\nThanks for helping us to bring more to Belle of the Ball - keep spreading the good word and let's keep this party going strong!\n\"I\u2019m very pleased with Belle of the Ball. It played well with all our groups and left everyone satisfied. Dice Hate Me Games has another great game here and I\u2019m pretty sure they know it.\" - Cyrus Kirby, FatherGeek\n\"Quick enough to get a game in without feeling rushed, strategic enough that there is the occasional pause to figure out the best move. It\u2019s a great balance of luck and strategy.\" - Ken Grazier, Geek-Craft\n\"The instant I picked up the cards for Belle I was hooked on the concept and look of the game! Belle was my favorite game at UnPub 2013. I played it three times and each time it was unique and enjoyable. Even though Belle focuses on the individual player's decisions, it is super interactive and enjoyable for serious gamers and party gamers alike!\"  - Lesley Louder, ChalkboardGamer\n\"Belle of the Ball is fun. Simple as that. The art is slick, the names of the guests had our group laughing, and the game play is fluid. This is a nice game to breakout with pretty much any group of people - it's simple yet maintains a level of strategy that anyone can engage with. Definitely glad this got to the table at GenCon.\" - Charlie & Matt, Sizzlemoth\n\"My husband and I had the opportunity to play Belle of the Ball during GenCon. Out of the many (many) games we played it is one of two we continuously gush over. It's easy to understand, quick to set up, laugh out loud enjoyable, and gorgeous. Hats off to designer Daniel Solis and well done to Dice Hate Me for picking another winner!\" - Annisa Jones, Tangerini\n\"I loved playing Belle of the Ball. The theme, art, graphics and mechanics blend into a wonderful package worthy of placement on any game shelf. I am excited to play this with family and friends! Cannot wait to get everyone announcing their invitees to the ball!\" - Brian Frahm, frahminator\n\"Belle of the Ball is the best game for couples since Lost Cities!\" - the_FlyingSheep\nKickstarter provides a platform for direct consumers to get Belle of the Ball shipped directly to their door before it hits the store shelves. As a retailer, though, you may reserve copies of the game through Game Salute.\nWithout our Kickstarter Backers, Dice Hate Me Games would not be able to bring quality games to market. To show our respect and appreciation, DHMG promises that backer copies of Belle of the Ball will be shipped out before copies are available for purchase at retailers or conventions. DHMG also pledges to keep all backers informed at every step in the development, printing and delivery processes. We love staying in touch with all of our supporters, so please never hesitate to contact us with questions and concerns.\nHello again! Can you all believe that two years after the launch of our first title, Carnival, that we're here presenting our sixth Dice Hate Me Games title? These past couple of years have been an overwhelming experience, and I'm humbled by the support from everyone that has been along for the ride since day one - or joined us along the way!\nI'm very excited about Belle of the Ball, and I think you all will have so much fun throwing your parties - especially when announcing your guests! Daniel Solis has poured out his heart and put all of his extremely creative mind into this project for over two years, and I couldn't be more proud to offer it to all of you.\nThanks in advance for all of your support - now come on in and let's get this party started!\nAll the best,\nChris Kirkman", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs with any project that involves the production and manufacture of a good to be delivered, there is certainly a real chance for hiccups, delays and more than one or two gremlins gumming up the works along the way.\n\nLuckily, we have a few projects under our belt, and have dealt with many of those snafus and gremlins. We have a good working relationship with two of our overseas manufacturers and have become accustomed to their protocols, communication styles and general idiosyncrasies. We try to plan for all contingencies, and we've been fairly successful with that in our past projects.\n\nWe've learned a lot these past couple of years. The last Dice Hate Me Games project - VivaJava: The Coffee Game: The Dice Game - was successfully funded last month and is currently in production. Things are going smoothly with that project, so far, but it still falls well within the risks and challenges category since we are still awaiting dice samples and file approvals. We are vigilant and resourceful, however, and will keep on top of that project while we promote and prepare Belle (and Carnival and The Great Heartland Hauling Co.) for a hopeful production run. If there's one thing we've gotten good at it, it's multitasking!\n\nWe won't lie - stuff happens. Delays can occur. Sometimes you have to go back and forth on color samples six times just to get the color right, and even then the color isn't perfect. But what we do promise is that we will hold ourselves to the same high standards we expect from other board game publishers, and we will be completely honest and open with each of you every step of the way.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #26", "update_userinfo": "Party Reports!", "update_content": "Greetings card gamers,\nWe\u2019re pleased to announce that all pledges for Belle of the Ball, Carnival, and The Great Heartland Hauling Co. have been shipped out to backers!

Seriously though, it works! Our illustrations are fun, quirky and memorable and we have plans, big plans, if you will help us! Chineasy has been on the Internet now for a few months, since my TED talk, and we have already amassed quite a following, if we do say so ourselves. We have turned to Kickstarter because we KNOW that there is a real desire for a book, as well as other Chineasy material. We are here because people won\u2019t stop asking us for MORE!\nIt is evident that people are hungry to learn about China. People are keen to be able to communicate with the 1.3 billion people. Yet there is not much out there to enable them to do so. Whilst the entire Chinese population is learning English, it is time for us to really comprehend this complex economy and society with our own eyes, knowledge and judgment. Knowing their language is the first baby step but a crucial one.\nThe real agenda behind this project is to bridge the gap between the East and the West.\nI want to give the West a real understanding and knowledge of China and Chinese culture through their own eyes rather than through layers of packaging, manipulation or loss in translation. Chineasy will become the first step for anyone in the world who wants to understand China, Chinese culture and its language. It is educational, social, cultural and inspirational. I am demonstrating the beauty of this deep and ancient culture with a modern interpretation through sleek modern design. For me this is also an arts project, as I grew up in an artistic family. I am connecting the dots by going back to my artistic upbringing, and connecting my life's journey through the East and the West.\nThe Methodology\nThe Chinese language has long been considered the most difficult major language to learn, largely on account of the vast number and complexity of its characters. Being a Taiwanese native now living in London, this is a fact I am acutely aware of. When I began to teach my British born children Chinese, I realized just how difficult Chinese characters are for a native English speaker to learn. It was like torture for my kids! So I spent many years looking for a fun and easy way to teach them how to read Chinese. After years of searching, I realised that none of the methods out there were engaging or efficient enough. So I did what any entrepreneur would do, I created my own method to learn how to read Chinese characters: Chineasy. And you know what? It works.\nChineasy allows people to learn to read Chinese easily by recognising common characters through simple illustrations. Behind the charming and engaging illustrations, the entire system is based on a rather complex programme I designed on my computer by breaking down and reconstructing thousands of characters. It is the CPU behind this method.\nThe magical power of the Chineasy method is that by learning one small set of building blocks, students can build many new words, characters, and phrases. Master a few building block sets and your learning will accelerate to a whole new level. With very little effort, learners are able to read several hundred Chinese characters and phrases whilst simultaneously gaining a deeper understanding of the historical and cultural influences behind the vocabulary. Even though there are tens of thousands of Chinese characters, only a few hundred are actually necessary to comprehend basic Chinese literature and begin to delve into Chinese culture and art.\nThe Oxford English Dictionary has 171,476 words in it, but I think it is safe to say that most people do not know all 171,476 of them. In Chinese, though we have thousands of characters, not all of them are needed to understand the language. For instance:\n20,000 = Characters in a Scholar's vocabulary \n1,000 = Characters used in standard literacy \n200 = Characters used Basic literacy\nWith top 200 most frequently used characters a person will be able to understand about 40% of the basic Chinese literature. The trick is to know how to build phrases by using those characters. This is enough to understand Chinese found in Menus and on road signs.\nIn Chineasy we started off with 8. With these 8 building blocks we can quickly build hundreds of compounds (made up of two or more building blocks) and phrases (made up of two or more building blocks & compounds). Have a look at Chineasy.org then you will be amazed how many more characters and phrases you are able to recognise and remember just knowing the first set of 8 building blocks.\nAre you are confused by all of the terminology? See below\nHow we create illustrations\nWhat makes Chineasy unique is its beautiful visual style, which is highly memorable, but also captures the fun and modern side of Chinese. But, these simple illustrations are anything but simple to create \u2013 as our three designers will tell you! Each character we create has to follow the same three guidelines: they have to look stunning, be stylistically consistent with what we have produced before and most importantly they have to be educationally effective.\nBefore we even start designing our team researches the definition, origin and history of the character. We then move on to the applications (for example, how to build more characters and phrases) and finally we consider how to make stories out of them.\nAfter this research our designers create their different interpretations of the character. We always have several versions and numerous drawings for each. Between us we then discuss, debate, bounce ideas and then finally decide on a final version to you. Each character is one of our children!\nHelp us!\nWith your help we would like to publish a Chineasy book. We have already made a start, but we want to do more and we want to share the characters with you in all of their Glory! With your help we can finish our first batch of characters and publish them in a beautifully bound book. We hope to include characters and phrases and stories (what sort of book would it be without some stories!)\nIf we succeed we would also like to produce even more educational material such as an App and audio recordings, we have so many things planned!!!!!!\nThe Creator\nShaoLan in her own words: Hiya All! Growing up as the daughter of a calligrapher and ceramic artist in Taiwan, art and an appreciation for the beauty of the Chinese language has always been a huge part of my life, but I admit\u2026it is not easy to learn!\nI\u2019d like to think of myself as an entrepreneur, geek, writer, traveler and dreamer. I have had several dramatic career changes in the past and, while studying for an MBA, I wrote four best-selling books on software.. In my second semester I co-founded my first venture, pAsia Inc, which became a major player in the Internet sector in the Greater China area in the late 1990\u2019s. After moving to London, I began investing in and advising young technology companies through Caravel Capital, which I founded in 2005 whilst studying at the University of Cambridge. So you could say that I have now come full circle with Chineasy as I have finally gone back to my artistic roots...\nBut, Chineasy isn\u2019t a one-man band! We have been incredibly lucky to have the artistic talents of the illustrator Noma Bar supporting us. He saw something in Chineasy and has been helping the whole team come up with fun and memorable illustrations for all of the characters \u2013 it is not an easy task!\nBreaking down the Great Wall of Chinese one character at a time!\nWhat Your Support Means!\nAs well as the book, the money we raise on Kickstarter will also let us fund the expansion of Chineasy in the following ways:\nChineasy Rewards - Go on, you know you want them!\nOnce we are funded we will be able to create more SET posters such as Nature, Animal and Person!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nEverything is uncertain in life, but the one thing you can be sure of is that if we get the money you will get the rewards of your choice.

We will aim to get everything to you by Christmas so that you can share the Chineasy love with the whole family, but unfortunately, we cannot be responsible for the post (though we will do our best!).\n\nAll stretch goals will be initiated once the campaign is successful, but wont be completed for at least 4 months due to the commissioning process. \n\nOnce we get the book published copies will eventually become commercially available in early 2014, however Kickstarter backers would get theirs first.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #48", "update_userinfo": "Happy Lunar New Year of the Dog!", "update_content": "Happy Lunar New Year of the Dog!

Will your squad advance cautiously, utilizing cover and outmaneuvering the enemy, or will they charge furiously into melee combat where brute force and resilience will win the day? In battle, how you command your warcaster, warjacks, and warriors and the tactical decisions you make to adapt to your enemy will determine your squad\u2019s fate.\nIn WARMACHINE: Tactics, you\u2019ll be able to save multiple squads in different configurations so that you can always pick the best load out for the mission or opponent at hand. And if you want to see how your squad stacks up, you\u2019ll be able to pit them against an AI opponent in order to try out your strategies and evaluate their performance before putting them to the true test against opponents from around the world.\nThe Iron Kingdoms are populated by rare individuals who possess incredible arcane talents in addition to unmatched combat skills. Even more important, they can mentally command and channel their power through the most devastating weapons of war\u2014warjacks. In WARMACHINE: Tactics, your squad is led by such a warcaster, one of many unique characters drawn from a colorful pantheon that makes up the epic cast of this setting. Each warcaster possesses an arsenal of weapons tailored to his personal fighting style as well as a unique combination of spells and skills. These include a defining arcane feat that, when used at the right time, can turn the tide of battle.\nWarcasters possess a replenishing reservoir of magical energy, called focus, which endows them with their superhuman abilities. Focus is used to cast spells, charge the protective fields of their specially created battle armor, and increase the effectiveness of their combat abilities.\nEvery warcaster interacts with his or her warjacks and warriors differently. One warcaster may promote aggressive strategies and bolster her squad\u2019s performance in melee combat, while another warcaster may provide greater defense and longevity to his squad, encouraging a more methodical approach to victory. The interchangeability of warcasters in WARMACHINE: Tactics provides nearly infinite replayability and ensures that no two game experiences are ever the same.\nThe spearhead of the WARMACHINE fighting force is the warjack. Outfitted with an array of wicked weaponry, these imposing constructs of steel and iron are brought to life through a fusion of steam power and magic and controlled with deadly precision by the warcaster.\nA warcaster is in constant telepathic contact with her warjacks and can channel her focus through a warjack to boost the machine\u2019s combat abilities and enable it to execute devastating power attacks.\nThe relationship between warcasters and their warjacks is as close as the kinship between any brothers in arms. Over time, a warjack gains experience and may bond with its warcaster, taking on unique personality characteristics and developing new aptitudes.\nFleshing out the squad in WARMACHINE: Tactics are the warriors. Encompassing a wide range of disciplines and roles, warriors are selected for the fighting capability and supporting tactics they add to your squad based on how you want the force to operate on the battlefield.\nSquads in WARMACHINE: Tactics are small, elite units, and the warriors that comprise them are all heroes in their own right. The warriors bring with them a gallery of incredible weapons and abilities that can make a squad perform efficiently and effectively in any situation, from rapid assaults to stealthy hit-and-run maneuvers and everything in between.\nEach battle awards warriors, warjacks, and your warcaster with experience that unlocks new options for your squad, like tactical feats for the warriors or bonds between the warcaster and his warjacks that affect the performance of the warjacks in specific situations. This ever-growing list of options can be accessed during squad building to customize your force to your precise strategy.\nEach campaign will focus on a single novice warcaster character and allow you to play through the formative experience that evolves that character into a full-fledged warcaster, also playable in multiplayer.\nThe campaigns will deliver an extensive, story-driven experience. Although conducting your squad during campaign battles works exactly like combat in multiplayer, you\u2019ll also have the opportunity to choose how the central character develops her abilities through the course of her evolution.\nWARMACHINE: Tactics will ship with the \u201cNo Man\u2019s Land\u201d campaign, featuring Cygnar\u2019s Lt. Allison Jakes, a young journeyman warcaster trained as a duelist who is unexpectedly thrust into a position of great responsibility and leadership before she is ready. Under your command, Lt. Jakes will rise to the occasion in the face of horror and adversity in this harrowing story that will define her character forever in the ongoing saga of WARMACHINE.\nFuture campaigns will explore all the factions of WARMACHINE and feature a cast of characters uniquely designed for both the video game and the tabletop.\nOne of the most exciting aspects of WARMACHINE: Tactics is being able to play against your friends no matter where you are or what time it is. Online multiplayer will support both synchronous and asynchronous play, so you can compete head-to-head against a live opponent on the other side of the world, or you can play the asynchronous \u201cplay-by-mail\u201d mode, which allows both players to take turns at their leisure. If you don\u2019t have a friend available and still want to get your battle on, you\u2019ll be able to find an opponent with automatic matchmaking. And WARMACHINE: Tactics will offer casual, ranked, and tournament play to suit the style of every player.\nMultiplayer will be supported with regular releases of new maps, units, and even whole new factions. We want to ensure that your game experience is consistently fresh and offers new challenges every time you play.\nOur funding goal allows us to produce the single-player campaign and the multiplayer mode featuring playable forces with multiple warcasters, warjacks, and warriors for the Cygnar and Khador factions as well as some Cryx units that appear in the single-player campaign\u2014about three dozen units in all. We hope to get a whole lot more in there by achieving our stretch goals: the WARMACHINE tabletop game currently includes over 500 distinct warriors, warjacks, and warcasters, and our ambition is to bring as many of them into WARMACHINE: Tactics as possible. Our goal is to deliver regular expansions to the game in the form of campaign and themed bundles that will add new characters to your faction rosters and new stories to experience. Multiplayer maps will also be released regularly as free downloads, available to play by everyone.\nWe\u2019re not just going to show you some pretty pictures and expect that you\u2019ll back our project. We\u2019re going to entice you with what we hope are tantalizing offers you can\u2019t refuse!

This collaboration has allowed us time to bond, to learn to work effectively and efficiently, and to develop the trust required for two entities to undertake the challenge of bringing a dream to life. Individually, we bring vital expertise and resources to the WARMACHINE: Tactics project, and together we can achieve more than either of us ever could alone.\nPrivateer Press Interactive and WhiteMoon Dreams have made a considerable investment in time and money to pay for the initial development of WARMACHINE: Tactics. We accepted this risk so that we could present a project worthy of your confidence. Our belief is that by promoting this project on Kickstarter, we\u2019ll raise the profile of the game and expand awareness of WARMACHINE to an even wider audience that will help us achieve the funding necessary to produce the best version of WARMACHINE: Tactics possible.\nIn early 2013, Privateer Press Interactive and WhiteMoon Dreams officially joined forces to co-produce WARMACHINE: Tactics without the traditional support of a publisher.\nPrivateer Press Interactive was founded by Matt Wilson, owner and Chief Creative Officer of Privateer Press, Inc., the leading independent producer of tabletop miniatures games, best known for WARMACHINE, the game of steam-powered combat set in the fantastic world of the Iron Kingdoms. The mission of Privateer Press Interactive is to bring the tabletop gaming worlds of Privateer Press into the digital medium.\nWilson, who created WARMACHINE, has worked in the game industry for over 18 years as an artist, art director, writer, and award winning game designer. Prior to the twelve years of titles he has generated at Privateer Press, Wilson art directed and was the lead concept artist for Magic: the Gathering at Wizards of the Coast, as well as contributing artistically to Dungeons & Dragons, FASA\u2019s Battletech and Shadowrun lines, and AEG\u2019s Legend of the Five Rings, where he also created the world and developed the game.\nFor six years, Los Angeles-based WhiteMoon Dreams has worked with companies all over the world to bring their games to market and has been heavily involved in game technology R&D with partners including Disney, Intel, and Tencent. WhiteMoon Dreams is helmed by founder and CEO, Jay Koottarappallil, who has spent 18 years in the video game industry working on a range of titles, including the Myth, Ratchet & Clank and Medal of Honor series\u2019.\nKoottarappallil has assembled a team of design heavyweights including Creative Director Scott Campbell, one of the key minds behind the original Fallout, and Game Director Kevin Mack, who ushered Fear Effect and Medal of Honor. Projects at WhiteMoon Dreams are managed by Executive Producer Rusty Buchert, a revered icon for indies everywhere for his work at Sony on such titles as Flow, Flower and Journey as well as being responsible for some of Interplay\u2019s biggest games, including Descent, several Star Trek games, and many others.\nBy combining and sharing resources between our two companies, we are able to move rapidly and efficiently through the development process of video game production. WARMACHINE: Tactics is a true collaboration, and because of the constant communication and the fact that WARMACHINE'S creator, Matt Wilson is part of the game\u2019s design team, we are able to ensure the most faithful interpretation of the WARMACHINE setting possible.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nA letter from Privateer Press Interactive founder, Matt Wilson:\n\nVideo games are complex undertakings. Everything presented on the screen has been painstakingly created by many disciplined professionals\u2014artists, animators, programmers, designers, and audio and effects engineers. Games are a meticulously orchestrated symphony that, when well presented, create unforgettable interactive experiences for those who play them. If the concert isn\u2019t well executed or conducted, the result is sluggish performance, a frustrating interface, low-quality art, or missed deadlines.\n\nThese variables make predicting the outcome uncertain, but every potential problem is surmountable with the proper application of time. Ideally preparation and experience will help avoid any pitfalls, and carefully planned contingencies will make it less disruptive when one is unavoidable. The most significant challenge in software development is simply delivering what\u2019s been promised on time.\n\nWhile it may appear Privateer Press has made some bold moves in the past, the truth is, we are risk averse. We make our decisions cautiously, with great consideration and calculation. Privateer Press Interactive, being composed of the same executive team, is no different. We know our greatest risk in this is the reputation of the Privateer Press name we have built over the past twelve years, and we have not undertaken this project lightly.\n\nThe decision to launch this project on Kickstarter came after nearly a year and a half of observation and analysis of other crowdfunded projects, and our decision to make this journey with WhiteMoon Dreams follows nearly five years of friendship and trust developed from our professional association. This is not a quickly conceived scheme, nor are we entrusting our beloved WARMACHINE to an unknown quantity. We have weighed the alternatives and considered the variables, and we\u2019re confident in our choice of development partners. But that\u2019s not enough. Just like you, we needed to see it in action.\n\nTo be sure of our decision, along with WhiteMoon Dreams we have funded several months of development on WARMACHINE: Tactics so we\u2019d be able to show you something credible and worthy of your pledge. We didn\u2019t want to just show concept art and offer lengthy descriptions of the game we envision; we set out to prove we have a team with the talent to bring this world to life. New progress is made on the game daily, and we\u2019ll be sharing that with you regularly throughout the campaign and right up until the product launch. We\u2019ve chosen a realistic funding goal that will support the required development, and we\u2019ve committed to a comfortable timeline with built-in contingencies should we encounter unavoidable delays. And we have planned our current funding beyond the end of this Kickstarter so that our team can remain focused on its continued development without skipping a beat.\n\nWhen we undertook this project, we also made a pledge: we will not launch another Kickstarter project until WARMACHINE: Tactics has released and has achieved all we have promised to deliver in the basic game as well as all the stretch goals we reach. We view this Kickstarter campaign as our one shot\u2014our single opportunity to create this game on our terms, and with your support.\n \nWe will honor your support above all else.\n\nNo one knows the future. When I met Jay Koottarappallil of WhiteMoon Dreams five years ago, neither of us imagined we\u2019d someday be making our WARMACHINE game this way. But now, more than ever, I am confident it will get done\u2014and I can\u2019t wait to play it with you.\n\nMatt Wilson\nOwner & CCO\nPrivateer Press, Inc.\nPrivateer Press Interactive, Inc.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #85", "update_userinfo": "LATEST DEVELOPMENTS", "update_content": "Greetings WARMACHINE: Tactics Backers!\nWhiteMoon Dreams is forging ahead with the development of WARMACHINE: Tactics and has some great news about the latest patch, available today, and what's coming up.

They crash land on a weird planet and end up locked in a mysterious fortress called Armikrog. Then...the adventure begins!\nThe Game\nArmikrog is a point and click adventure game that features all of the characteristics of TenNapel's unmistakable style:\nQuirky and lovable characters\nUnique worlds\nA compelling story\nMind-bending puzzles\nGreat animation\nTons of clay!\nThe Music\nTerry S. Taylor -- the award winning composer of The Neverhood soundtrack, will be composing and performing an entirely new original soundtrack for the game. Hooray!!!\nArmikrog will be available DRM-free for PC (WINDOWS), MAC OSX and LINUX, and distributed though GOG.com, The Humble Store and several other digital distribution platforms. For those of you who prefer Steam, we are now on Steam Greenlight. Click the link below where you can vote YES for Armikrog and boost our popularity!\nArmikrog on Steam Greenlight\nMaking this game will be a labor of love, and a \"thank you\" to all Neverhood fans and adventure gamers.\nArmikrog is being developed by Pencil Test Studios, an independent game development company located in Lake Forest, CA. Along with Doug TenNapel, the team includes core members from The Neverhood, as well as puppet fabricators, sculptors, and animators that will help to create the stop-motion that makes this project so unique.\nArmikrog will also feature the voice talents of:\nThe Neverhood was conceived and created from the ground up over a 12 month period. Armikrog will be developed using the Unity engine for PC, MAC and LINUX in order to secure the goal of completing the project within one year. We'll also be using many of the same animation, modelling, sculpting, set building and clay & puppet fabrication methods we've used before\u2014keeping the overall game design scalable so that we can create a fun and exciting experience within our targeted funding goal, but still have the flexibility to expand, should the opportunity present itself.\nOf course, none of this happens without your support, which is why we are reaching out to you through Kickstarter. Why Kickstarter? Funny you should ask...\nKickstarter is our most direct link to you, the fans. This is your opportunity to express whether or not you'd like to see another clay and puppet, stop-motion adventure game. Armikrog is a unique and creative project that we would love to make for those of you who have, over the years, dreamed of the chance to immerse yourself in another world made of clay. We're here to offer you the opportunity to make this project a reality.\nWhile our funding goal is considerably less than The Neverhood cost to produce in 1997, it is still our biggest hurdle. But in light of what it will cost to create, the real question is this: Would you support and play this game for $25?\nIf enough of you support it, you will get this game.\nThe Armikrog game will be comparable in size and scope to The Neverhood. It's been noted that our initial funding goal is significantly less than the cost of the original Neverhood game--this is possible since we are now utilizing technology that was not available to us 15 years ago (Unity engine, post-production and editing software, etc) which will allow us to create this game more efficiently with a overall higher level of quality.\nIn addition to our more conventional game production pipeline, we are also utilizing many of the same stop motion techniques used in such feature films as Paranorman and Nightmare Before Christmas. A significant portion of our budget is allocated toward puppet fabrication and sculpting, set building, lights, cameras, and lots and lots of clay!\nStop motion animation is an art all of its own. Each puppet, set and prop is individually hand-crafted by artists, while each and every frame is painstakingly animated. This specialized process is what makes this game unique--and we feel the time and talent that it takes to bring a project like this to this to life is worth every penny.\n100% of the funds that are raised will go directly into the production of the game. To date, we\u2019ve invested over $100,000 into the preproduction, design, and development, and we can see how fun and amazing this project will be. We want to deliver an incredible experience to all of you who support us, and applying 100% of your contributions toward development is the only way this will happen.\nIllustration by Earthworm Jim poster artist, Mike Koelsch\nRewards fall into two basic categories: Digital Rewards that are distributed though Steam and/or comparable download venues, and Physical Rewards that will be distributed through the mail. Note that all physical rewards under $1000 have an additional shipping cost for supporters with addresses outside of the United States.\nRewards that are not dependent on the production of the actual game will be fulfilled before the date specified in the reward tiers. Since we can't predict the amount of rewards that will need to be fulfilled, all rewards have been given the same fulfillment date as the game's ship date (July 2014). Once the campaign has ended, we will notify you of the fulfillment dates for those rewards that will ship sooner.\nBoxed Edition in the big, old-school size (mockup - design not finalized)\nKickstarter Exclusive Armikrog T-Shirt ($200 tier and above)\nTommynaut stop-motion production puppet\nDigital Rewards\nPhysical Rewards\nArmikrog is already getting a lot of great press.

Having many of the original members of The Neverhood team is a tremendous asset, as we already have the experience of creating this type of game. All games face unforeseen challenges throughout the course of production, but we have yet to face a challenge that we couldn't overcome. We have already begun to detail the entire scope of the game before production begins, which will help to define and minimize risks--which is key to the successful development of any game.\n\nWe've already invested a substantial amount of time and money into preproduction, laying the groundwork for an amazing game and we hope that you are as excited as we are about this project.

We've come so far in pairing these two genres together, and we're asking for your help to take us across the finish line\nCryptozoic Entertainment, creators and publishers of the World of Warcraft Trading Card Game, is excited and proud to introduce HEX: Shards of Fate, the first real MMO/TCG. A completely unique game that takes place in an original and exciting fantasy world, HEX was created from the ground up as a digital trading card game and brings tremendous innovation to how a TCG can be played.\nWith all the social interaction and roleplaying you would expect from a fully featured MMORPG, along with the deep strategic and collectible game play of a TCG, HEX is a completely new gaming experience. We're designing full card sets, dungeons, storyline, community tools, advanced AI, and so much more. This is a massive undertaking and that's why we're asking for your help to bring HEX to life.\nWhat are our goals for HEX?\n\u2022 We want to bring together both experienced TCG veterans and new players who have never played a collectible card game before. The game is free to download and play, so anyone can give it a try!\n\u2022 We want you to join guilds with other TCG players and practice dueling with the latest deck builds. \n\u2022 We want you to enter online TCG tournaments and win awesome prizes. \n\u2022 We want you to take your TCG skills and have them drive an RPG experience, unlocking new cards and treasure, as well as developing your character within a compelling, completely original story.\n\u2022 Most of all, we want the experience to be deep, engaging, and polished.\nThat\u2019s what we want to provide for you \u2026 but we need your help!\nHEX takes everything you would expect from a full, deep trading card game and combines it with a massively multiplayer online role-playing game\nLet\u2019s start by discussing the elements of the TCG.\nThe great news is that HEX was designed from the ground up to take advantage of the \u201cdigital\u201d part of \u201cdigital TCG\u201d. This means we have innovated a number of fun and unique ways of doing things that have never been done before in a TCG, which are detailed below. \nHere at Cryptozoic, our bread and butter is creating polished TCGs; it\u2019s how we make our living. When it comes to producing a balanced and deep TCG experience, the design is king. The fun digital features will always support and enhance the play experience, and never trump it. Features like clean resource tracking, transforming cards, and allowing you to easily broadcast your games to viewers across the internet are all possible due to innovation in the digital space. \nFor experienced TCG players, we have designed the card set around Booster Draft and Limited play. We have engineered the card sets to launch three times a year, like a standard TCG. We have put a tremendous amount of work into creating the best possible online TCG experience, both in terms of balance and design, as well as a graphical polish. \nNot only that, but surrounding this TCG is an amazing online role-playing experience\nAs can be expected from the company that makes the World of Warcraft TCG, we are a company filled to the brim with hardcore MMORPG players, and some of our designers have even built MMORPGs in the past. For example, Kevin Jordan, who was one of the three original designers of the universe\u2019s most successful MMORPG, World of Warcraft, is now the lead for the HEX MMORPG elements.\n As hardcore MMORPG players, we had a huge list of features that we thought could really make an online TCG incredible! Not the least of which is a robust, story-based PVE experience, complete with dungeons and raids and monsters and loot, all tied around playing a card game. When we started thinking about PVE, community, guilds, auction houses, factions, storytelling (all the stuff that makes an MMORPG fun), we knew that HEX could be something special, something that had never been done before! \nIt is difficult to get all the innovation built into HEX into one easy-to-digest place, but let\u2019s give it a try with this handy\u2026 \nFEATURES LIST!\nMMORPG:\n- Create your CHAMPION character with a choice of 6 classes and 8 races\nFully customizable champions with talents, gear, and game altering abilities that revolutionize the TCG experience.\nPre alpha game play\n- Collect GEAR in rarities from common to legendary and tailor your champion\u2019s winning strategy\nEach card in the game is linked to several pieces of gear that fundamentally change how the card works. Equip this gear and find MILLIONS of unique combos and winning strategies. \nAnd keep your eyes open for extra rare SET BONUSES\n- Explore dozens of DUNGEONS and battle with friends in epic RAIDS\nDungeons offer the ultimate PVE experience: deep TCG puzzles and encounters unfold the world of HEX and offer over a hundred hours of game play, storytelling, and the chance to earn new cards and gear (including over 300 unique PVE cards).\nKraken's Gold Dungeon\nHEX FEATURES THE MOST ADVANCED TCG AI EVER CREATED\n- Utilize HEX\u2019s advanced GUILD functionality, and join or create the ultimate TCG group\nPractice with friends using the guild deck bank, or join guild sanctioned tournaments.\nShare cards with your guild via the guild bank\n- Buy and sell cards, gear, and other in-game rewards in a robust and fully featured AUCTION HOUSE\nA full player economy will allow you to trade and sell your gear and cards as you build the ultimate collection.\n- Earn FACTION REWARDS as you complete quests and unlock world-shattering adventures in the world of HEX\nFaction rewards offer players unique cards and gear; as your faction allegiance grows, so does the power of your rewards.\nTCG:\n- Fully featured TCG with over 350 cards in the first set alone\nCryptozoic is a leading TCG publisher with years of experience building the World of Warcraft TCG; we have brought that expertise to HEX with the same attention to detail so we can offer the finest digital TCG experience available.\nPre alpha gameplay and interface\nAmazing Digital TCG Innovations!\n- SOCKETED CARDS! Put gems into cards to customize how they play\u2026 with the first ever sandbox TCG, you can design the card\nWith 20 gems in the first set and numerous socketed cards, the combinations are endless as you mix and match to create your own perfect combo.\n- The DOUBLE BACK feature makes each card a unique collectable and gives each a life of its own\nFlip your card and see its back, flip it again and see the DOUBLE BACK; each double back features 3 card achievements (unlock them all to transform the card into an \u201cextended art\u201d version), a leveling bar (fill it to transform the card into a foil variant), a trophy case (earn trophies using the card in a tournament-winning deck), and other card-specific information.\n- TRANSFORMING CARDS change mid-match as you play, level your troop or hatch a mighty dragon from an egg during the fight\nTransforming cards offer players the chance to engage in new strategic formats in an effort to grow their cards mid-match and unlock fun powers and game winning abilities.\n- The most aggressive ORGANIZED PLAY infrastructure ever offered for a digital TCG\nWith dozens of daily tournaments, on demand 8-player drafts and (potentially) REAL CASH prizes, HEX is poised to be the definitive professional online TCG.\nCome tournament time, test your mettle in limited (sealed and booster) and constructed tournaments, where the winner is determined by skill and daring, not by PVE-enhanced cards.\nFounded in 2010, Cryptozoic Entertainment, Inc. is a premier developer and publisher of original and licensed board games, card games, comics and trading cards, including the World of Warcraft\u00ae Trading Card Game, DC Deck Building Game, Epic Spell Wars of the Battle Wizards and The Walking Dead\u2122 Board Game. Following a philosophy and core principle of \"Fans First,\" the dedicated gamers and fans of the Cryptozoic Entertainment team are focused on producing fun and amazing products along with epic events that bring all gaming fans together as part of the Cryptozoic community. World of Warcraft TCG has been translated into 9 languages, and with millions of packs in print, it is one of the most popular TCGs in the world!\nCryptozoic makes games based on some of the most popular brands!\n\nThe scope and magnitude of HEX is bonkers! Not only are we trying to create a completely new gaming category (the MMO/TCG), but we are doing it at a scale that is just plain crazy \u2026 for example, this will be the largest first set of cards ever created for a TCG launch.\nBut we feel this is the type of game that needs to have everything in the first pass to make it work as a whole. The magic of HEX is that it has so many different things working together to create something remarkably fun and different.\nWe have been in development for almost two years and have accomplished a lot. As you can see from our videos and screenshots, the game is looking incredible. But we need your help to finish. With this last push we can fund HEX\u2019s remaining development and give this game the launch it deserves.\nAll of our reward tiers offer huge values. We are offering standard products at a fraction of the price you would buy them at launch, as well as very cool exclusive cards that will only be available through this Kickstarter (once this campaign ends, these Kickstarter-exclusive cards will never again appear in any future set release). We wanted to make sure that you are not just making a donation to finish the game, we want you to feel like you have made an investment in the online TCG you are going to playing for a very long time.\nOur goal is 300,000. This amount will insure we can meet the last of our art and engineering requirements. We have a robust number of stretch goals, and hope we can reveal some of them (hopefully, all of them!). With the support of you\u2014the gaming community\u2014we will be able to launch HEX together with all the features that will make this a landmark title.\n330K - Authenticator Support At Launch.

Video game development is not easy. It can be difficult to predict the stumbling blocks even in the best case scenario, so with something as new and innovative as HEX, it can be even more difficult. \n\nThe good news is that HEX has been in development for almost two years and we have built a series of deliverables that we believe can be completed in the remaining development time we have scheduled. We have tested the game systems and feel confident everything will socket together and create a fantastic experience.

A number of backers requested that they receive a discount off of shipping rather than receiving the \"free\" t-shirt, so we have arranged for an alternative. If you would like to receive the \"free\" t-shirt (I apologize about this because I guess at this point it is no longer free) please add $5 to your order for a total of $40. If you would like to opt out of receiving the t-shirt, please add $2 to your order for a total of $37. This was a horrible rookie mistake on our part and we beg for your understanding and forgiveness.\nBackers Located Outside of the US - please see the chart contained in the link below for information regarding the cost of shipping abroad.\nShipping Costs Chart\nOur first mistake was putting a $35 MSRP on this book rather than a higher amount ($50 or $60). We do not have the ability to change this as per our contract with Tezuka Productions.\nOnce we realized that we could not afford to pay for all domestic shipping, we had to make a choice. Our options as we saw it were to either (1) make a lesser quality book, (2) restart the Kickstarter campaign to account for shipping expenses, or (3) ask that backers add money for shipping. For this first book, we did NOT want to compromise the quality, as our vision was to literally publish one of the highest quality manga ever released in English. Also, we have put way too many hours into this Kickstarter campaign and received too much support from the online community of Osamu Tezuka fans to start it all over again.\nPlease read updates #2, #3 and #4 for more details. Feel free to send us a message or email me personally at andrew@thekansaiclub.com with ANY questions or concerns. I will respond as soon as possible. Thanks for your amazing support!\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nWe would like to bring the joy of owning one of Osamu Tezuka\u2019s most charming and powerful collections of short stories to American Tezuka aficionados. Of the numerous short story collections created by the late and great \u201cGodfather of Japanese Comics,\u201d \u201cThe Crater\u201d stands out as the perfect blend of mystery, suspense, horror, fantasy and comedy. This is the first time that one of Tezuka-sensei\u2019s short story collections will be published in English.\n\u201cThe Crater\u201d first appeared in Japan\u2019s \u201cWeekly Shonen Champion\u201d and ran from August 10, 1969 to April 1, 1970. It has since been reprinted in Japanese on numerous occasions, but this is the first time that \u201cThe Crater\u201d will be published in English. Kansai Club will be publishing a SINGLE EDITION of this amazing book which will include all 17 short stories from the original publication. We are ONLY printing 2,000 copies of this book and each book will be individually numbered out of 2,000. Any books not sold on Kickstarter will be sold at our booth at the upcoming Florida Supercon in Miami, Florida from July 4-7th. If there are any books still available after the convention, we will be shipping the remainder to select comic book and specialty book stores throughout the country (where they will likely charge more than $35 a book). The books will be printed in a large high quality Hardcover format (7 x 10 inches) and will come with 3 different 7 in x 10 in art prints inspired by content from \u201cThe Crater\" (see pictures below).\nI am incredibly PROUD to announce that the books will also include a foreword by the award winning historian and author, Frederik Schodt, as well as an introduction by renowned historian and manga academic, Dr. Ada Palmer.To learn more about Frederik Schodt and his newest book, \"Professor Risley and the Imperial Japanese Troupe: How an American Acrobat Introduced Circus to Japan - and Japan to the West,\" check out his website at http://www.jai2.com/. To learn more about the fascinating world of Dr. Ada Palmer, please visit http://www.adapalmer.com/ and http://tezukainenglish.com/.\nAda is also currently running a Kickstarter campaign of her own, promoting her musical group Sassafrass' newest album/play, \"Sundown: Whispers of Ragnorak - Norse Myth Song Cycle.\" Sassafrass is an a cappella group, specializing in sci-fi, fantasy and mythology-themed songs, and complex polyphony. Sounds interesting right? Everyone should check out their Kickstarter campaign at http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/648994832/sundown-whispers-of-ragnarok-norse-myth-song-cycle?ref=live.\nAny person who pledges any amount of money for this Kickstarter campaign will automatically gain membership to our \"Kansai Club.\" You will receive access to an invite only message board on our website where we will be holding regular contests with prizes and you can communicate directly with Andrew and Yuka. Members of the \"Kansai Club\" will also receive our quarterly newsletter and be privy to promotional offers, discounts and be the first to hear about our future projects.\nWe will also be randomly including a T-shirt inspired by content from The Crater for every 50 books sold through Kickstarter. If we reach our extended goal of selling 1,000 books through this campaign, then EVERY person who pledged $35 or more will receive a FREE t-shirt with their order. If your pledge amount already included a t-shirt then we will send you 2! If we reach our super-duper-God-bless-the-internet goal of selling 1,500 copies of our book through Kickstarter, then we promise that the Kickstarter campaign for our next book will include 2 different books!\nThis project of ours is all or nothing. It took us over 6 months to convince Tezuka Productions to allow us to print The Crater. As an upstart publishing company with no street cred, we were required to pay the royalties for each of the 2,000 copies of the book in advance. It took us another few months to come up with this money. Almost $25,000 and well over 1,000 hours of sweat equity later, the project is just about reaching the end. This book will be published regardless of Kickstarter; too much time and money have already been invested into this project. At the same time, as a brand new publishing company, we NEED Kickstarter and the support of Osamu Tezuka fans in order to make our first project successful. If we are forced to sell this book through Amazon we may actually lose money on each book sold.\nEveryone needs to start somewhere and this is where it begins for us. EVERY penny made through the sales of this book and ALL related goods will go right back into our next project. If this Kickstarter campaign fails, then we will likely become defunct, never to see our dreams realized. However, if we succeed, then our future holds no boundaries. We have faith in you, so please have faith in us.\nIf you have any questions or concerns, you can post them on this Kickstarter page and our website, or feel free to email me personally at andrew@thekansaiclub.com.\nInformation to Take Into Consideration:\nThis book is not intended for young children. There are a few short stories that are appropriate for children under the age of 13, but the majority of them are not. Some of the stories include brief nudity, graphic scenes of violence, and content that children may have trouble understanding. However, all of this is done very tastefully. The short stories in The Crater bring to mind episodes of the original Twilight Zone series. Most are thought provoking, some contain political/social messages, and others are downright creepy. All of the stories contain Osamu Tezuka\u2019s signature sense of humor.\nThis book reads from right to left. Why did we do this? Because we prefer to read manga this way (and we also realize that many people would be angry with us if we printed left to right).\nEVERYTHING offered in the reward categories are EXCLUSIVE to this Kickstarter campaign. Once the campaign ends, these items will no longer be available for sale anywhere.\nArt Print #1\nArt Print #2\nArt Print #3\nT-Shirt\nThe images on this t-shirt have not yet been approved by Tezuka Productions and are subject to change.\nSticker\nThe images on this sticker have not yet been approved by Tezuka Productions and are subject to change.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe don't foresee the possibility of many setbacks to this project.

Just add paper and get this:\nEnvelopes made from scrapbook paper\nEnvelopes made from magazine pages\nEnvelopes made using your own photographs\nEnvelopes made with rubber stamps\nEnvelopes made with wrapping paper\nEnvelopes made with old calendars\nEnvelopes made using wallpaper\nEnvelopes made using kids' art\nEnvelopes made using maps\nWhich envelope would you pick up?\nWhat Is It?\nThe Kreate-a-lope\u00ae Envelope Maker is the fastest envelope maker on the planet! It does not require scissors or tracing and most people can make an envelope in about 30 seconds out of any kind of paper.\nWhen I first came up with it, I had no idea how many cool papers the world had to offer. I started with just using magazine pages and then discovered you could also recycle old calendars, wrapping paper, wall paper (you can get discontinued wall paper sample books from many paint and wall paper stores for free).\nAnd it just took off from there - I started using digitized photographs, a friend made an envelope using her newborn's footprints to make a birth announcement, people were telling me they made their own wedding invitations using fine papers, kids like to use it for their own artwork, and teenagers go almost as wild for it as card makers and rubber stampers. (I did my first press release using the Sunday comics.)\nIt's really an amazing tool that makes anyone feel creative and the list of papers and ways to make one-of-a-kind designs is endless. Not to mention, you can save a ton of money and bring smiles to the people in your life with your super cool creations.\nHow Does it Work?\nIt's very simple. You use the window of the bigger template to line up any image you want on the front. Then, you tear the paper against the edge of the template by pulling it towards the center on a slight angle. After you've sized the paper to match the bigger template, flip the paper over and realign the bigger template.\nThen, drop the rectangular template into the window, remove the bigger template, and fold the paper around the edges of the rectangular template. Then, glue the side flaps to the bottom flaps and seal the top flap when you're ready to send a letter, give a card, stuff it with cash as part of a gift, etc.\n\nThe cool thing is, because you use the window to line up your image, you can control what goes on the front. So, if you're making an envelope for your mom and she likes flowers, you can use a cool magazine page, or wrapping paper, wall paper, or just about anything with a flower on it - even your own digitized and printed photos!\nSay your dad, husband or boyfriend loves cars, use a cool photo of the latest sports car or a classic. Kids love comics and cartoons. Teens love who and what they love and crave to be unique and one-of-a kind in their expressions, the possibilities are endless!\nIf you're a card maker, why not make a beautiful envelope to go along with your beautiful card!\nFans of The Kreate-a-lope\u00ae\nCrafters\nCard makers\nRubber stampers\nPeople that love to recycle\nPeople of all ages\nMail art enthusiasts\nPeople that love to be creative\n\nWhat People Love About the Kreate-a-lope\u00ae\nWorks without scissors or tracing\nQuick & easy to use\nWorks with almost any kind of paper\nPuts a smile on your face\nThe reactions people get when they give someone a cool envelope\nAdding a cool envelope & card to a present\nMakes you feel creative\nRecycling\nIt's a great way to spend time with your children or grandchildren, but it's for adults too.\n\nWhat People Say - A Few Testimonials\n\"This is so simple yet so effective.

And so the templates we'll get from these runs are sure to be the best they can be.\n\nI also plan on moving the fulfillment to a new location so customer service and fulfillment will be better and faster. \nThe Rewards\nChoose from a Number of Different Sizes and Other Goodies\nKreate-a-lope\u00ae A2 Standard Invitation Size\nKreate-a-lope\u00ae A7 Standard Greeting Card Size\nKreate-a-lope\u00ae A6 Standard Greeting Card Size\nKreate-a-lope\u00ae #10 Business Envelope Size\nKreate-a-lope\u00ae A9 Half Sheet Size\n*colors may vary depending on ink availability and pricing\nKreate-a-lope\u00ae sizes & popular uses:\nA2 Standard Invitation Size - this is the template I used in the video.

I'm keen on the quality of the templates they've produced so far and the relatively quick turnaround.\nTo make the Kreate-a-lopes\u00ae we have to buy plastic sheeting in large quantities in order to make the production runs cost effective for us and you, the end user. We then print the artwork on the sheets with a process known as silk screening. After the printing process, the sheets are run through a die cutting press.\nFrom there, the excess plastic is stripped away and sent to our fulfillment house, where they are packaged for sale.\nIt's a very time consuming process and the screens need to be watched very closely for ink blotting and damage. The dies need to be watched closely as well. Once the blades on the dies get dull, cuts that should be straight might bow, or they might break or fracture the plastic instead of cutting it, among other things. If this happens, they have to be sent out to the company we buy them from and they rebuild them or replace them. But our new manufacturer is on top of things and the output thus far has been excellent.\nThis is what our steel rule cutting dies look like.\nThe die goes in this die cutting machine.\nThis is a standard screen frame. We make new screens for every run so they are pristine and the patterns come out great.\nThis is the screen printing machine used for printing on our Kreate-a-lopes\u00ae\nSpecial Thanks\nSpecial thanks to Jodi D. for letting me use her Nikon for the video and still photos, and to Recollections for many of the scrapbook papers shown in the video.

No problem! We'll continue to take preorders (and once it's printed, we'll have information on where you can buy it) - just check out http://www.cantripgames.com/storywar!\nStory War is a storytelling party game for 3 to 8 players. Players split into teams and take control of classic characters like Puss In Boots or a fire-breathing Dragon and use creativity and humor to defeat the opposing team.\nIn most other games the difference between victory and defeat has a lot to do with numbers; the story itself is secondary. But in Story War controlling the narrative is the only way to win. There are no numbers or rules on the cards, only artwork and hilarious descriptions. It's up to the players to decide how to interpret their powers, which means that every game tells unique stories based on the collective creativity of everyone involved.\nHow does it work?\nEach turn represents one battle between two teams of players. The setting is defined by a randomly drawn Battlefield card. Players then look at the Warrior cards and Item cards in their hands and try to come up with a clever strategy. Once every player has played their Warrior cards face-down, everyone flips their cards over simultaneously. Then players must quickly describe, in an open discussion, how their team would defeat the opposing team.\nEach battle is moderated by a judge that rotates every turn (similar to Apples to Apples) so the shared pop cultural context of everyone in the room is very important! Harry Potter fans might play the Basilisk card differently than Percy Jackson fans. Pokemon fans can cite obscure typing match-ups to explain why you can't punch a bird. Dungeons and Dragons players will often overlay D&D rules onto the game - don't even try to convince a D&D-playing judge that the Giant can defeat the Dwarf!\nPlayers are also free to make stuff up, as long as they can be convincing! Everything is being moderated by a judge so if your opponent claims their character is unrealistically powerful, you can challenge that claim. Once a challenge has been issued the judge has to immediately decide whether or not it's a valid move. This means your characters are able to do anything as long as the judge lets you get  away with it! The player acting as the judge and the grouping of teams changes after every turn, so the social dynamic is always shifting! Each battle ultimately evolves into an organic story and a memorable shared experience.\nWhat kind of stories are told?\nStory War was designed from the ground up with inclusiveness in mind. It can be played by anyone and different groups will tell different kinds of stories. If you're playing with gamers the stories are often more combat focused and if you're playing with writers, stories tend to be more character-driven.\nWhen you play Story War with young kids, then you'll likely end up telling G-rated stories. But if you're playing with just adults, the stories can become serious, inappropriate and often very scientific - can Midas turn a Ghost into gold? (Story War also makes a great drinking game!)\nHere's some examples of some great stories that happened in playtesting:\n\"The Lich is the Lady Gaga of the underworld and used her Twitter followers to attack her hater: a Zombie.\" (played by @LeiaJ)\n\"The Leprechaun created so much gold that gold became worthless and his society became isolationist and crumbled.\" (played by Brad)\n\"The Imp used the Philosopher's Stone to transform the air around the Fairy into a bottle - a bottle is the Fairy's nemesis!\" (played by Nick)\n\"The Treant was a Tree of Cheem from Doctor Who. It was protected by The Doctor because it's a space minority.\" (played by Khadijah)\n\"The Mimic put on the Mythril Tux to go to a party with other classic D&D characters but he got kicked out because he's always getting drunk and throwing up treasure and everyone hates him.\" (played by strangers)\nWe've playtested Story War hundreds of times with a diverse balance of ages, genders, and skills. Our objective was to make every card as interesting and useful as possible while also keeping the game accessible to anyone. It's a game that you can pull out of your pocket in front of a group of friends (or strangers) and within minutes everyone will be laughing and having fun.\nWho is making Story War?\nCantrip Games! Which consists of Tom McLean, Brad O'Farrell and Vondell Swain. The initial concept came from months of Tom and Brad prototyping and play-testing different card game ideas until we found something interesting. We knew Story War would require fantastic character design skills and hundreds of pieces of art so we hired Vondell Swain, who is only 19 years old but annoyingly talented at everything. We've spent the last 6 months writing, drawing, designing and playtesting. Now we need your help to finally publish Story War!\nBy becoming a backer of Story War, you'll get to have creative input on the expansion cards! We'll be posting unfinished sketches and concepts in our backers-only update section and welcoming feedback. Story War is a game for everybody, so it's really helpful for us to gather feedback from as many people as possible.\nBut also, backers get cool stuff! Read the list of options on the right side of the page for a full list of rewards. Here is more information about those rewards:\nPrint-and-Play Pack\nFor $10, you'll get a \"print-and-play\" PDF containing all the cards in Story War that you can print out on your own as soon as the campaign ends! (This PDF will also be available at all higher reward tiers.)\nBasic Pack\nFor $25, we'll ship you a physical copy of the Story War base set, which contains 100 cards and the rules. This set is already finished so we'll begin printing it as soon as the campaign ends. This is the game we've spent the last 6 months developing, and it includes cards such as:\nWarriors: Lich, Puss In Boots, Cherub\nBattlefields: Beanstalk, Capital City, Sky Port\nItems: Shrink Ray, Flame Bow, Bramble Seed\nHero Pack\nFor $40 you'll be sent a copy of the Story War base set as soon as it's printed and you'll also get a second shipment containing the expansion deck once it's completed. The expansion deck is less focused on Greek mythology and fairytales and more focused on Asian mythology, science fiction, and niche fantasy concepts.\nThe expansion deck will include at least 50 cards, but we'll add more cards as we get more funding! It will hopefully be expanded to 100 extra cards if we reach our funding goals!  We'll be able to develop the expansion deck much faster than the original deck because we'll have more resources and we'll be able to hire additional artists. But we've already begun working on it! Here are some of the cards it will include:\nWarriors: Oni (a Japanese demon), Kraken, Kami (a Japanese spirit)\nBattlefields: Lunar Colony, Labyrinth, Mystery Mansion \nItems: Philosopher's Stone, Bottomless Top Hat, Super Cape\nDeluxe Pack\nFor $60 you'll get everything listed above AND your copy of Story War will include a bunch of cool comics and exclusive cards! We've added a LOT to the Deluxe Pack since the project launched and unfortunately we can't edit the reward description. But if you back at $60, you won't just get the 5 cards mentioned in the reward description, you'll get ALL of the cards shown below:\nThese licensed cards are Kickstarter exclusives and they will NOT be sold later. The only way we're allowed to make them is as Kickstarter rewards.\nYou'll also get a bunch of \"blank\" cards - that is, cards you can write and draw on and shuffle into your Story War deck! They have the same backing as regular cards, so you can use them just as you would use any other card.\nCustom Cards\nFor $100 or more we'll make a custom card, just for you! Read the reward descriptions on the side-bar for more details! The lowest tier for custom cards is $100, where we'll redraw the Witch or Wizard card to resemble you. At the highest tier, we'll make a custom card based on you that will be included in EVERYBODY's copy of the expansion - the Dwarf card is an example of a card that's based on a real person (Brad O'Farrell, the creator of Story War!)\nShipping\nShipping is included in the cost of the cards, but backers outside the US will have to pay an additional $10. Story War will be printed immediately after this campaign ends and be shipped as soon as it's printed. But the Expansion Deck and any custom cards will be shipped separately  a few months later, after they've been completed.\nTo avoid paying for international shipping twice, we'll hold international orders until the complete order has arrived; if you're an international backer and you'd prefer two shipments instead of one delayed shipment please add an additional $10 to your order.\nStory War is already finished. We've spent the last 6 months playtesting, writing, and illustrating cards, printing prototype copies, and paying our artist out of pocket. We have a complete game of 100 cards and it's super fun! We only need $20,000 to recoup our losses and print the first run of the game. But if we raise over  $20,000, there are so many awesome things we could add to Story War!\nWhat would additional funds add to the game?\nExpansion Deck: We're planning to make at least 50 extra cards for the Expansion Deck, but we'd love to make a full 100 card expansion! That would mean, when combined with the base set, there'd be a full 200 cards! More cards means more random match-ups, which means greater variety between games! \nGame Modes: We've only ever playtested the game using a single set of rules, but we designed the cards to work with a lot of different styles of play. Game Modes would be new rules that you could print out and use with the standard Story War cards. If we raise enough money we'll develop these new Game Modes and distribute them for free.\nCampaigns: Campaigns are one-time-use stories that involve unexpected plot twists that affect the gameplay! These would also be distributed for free. A campaign would be printed out and given to a player who would act as the judge for the entire game. Think of it like watching a suspenseful movie with your friends, but you're also controlling what happens next!\nOnline Multiplayer Client: Story War actually started out as an online game that we first playtested using a chatroom robot. We decided to develop Story War into a card game for simplicity, but we always knew we wanted to ultimately make an online version. Everyone involved in this card game is also a video game programmer and we're very capable of making a high quality online version of Story War. We think the best implementation might be a webcam-based game using Google Plus Hangouts. But doing so would take a lot of time and energy and resources, so we've set it as our highest goal.\nHere are the milestones we're hoping to reach:\nFUNDED! Thank you so much everybody! The game is definitely going to ship now! We've also unlocked at least 50 cards for the expansion deck! More will be unlocked as we reach our stretch goals!\nWhoa! We hit our first stretch goal way faster than expected! This means the number of cards in the expansion (for everybody who backed with $40 or more) increases from 50 to 60! If we reach all of our stretch goals, the expansion will be a full 100 card deck!\nAwesome, our first game mode has been unlocked! \nIt's called Myth Master! It uses all the same cards as Story War and is structured similarly, the key difference is that you are playing as yourself manifested into the battlefield and you are summoning Warriors from the cards in your hand. The ultimate objective isn\u2019t just to take out the other player\u2019s Warriors, it\u2019s to take out the human player who is controlling them, just like in Magic the Gathering, YuGiOh, and the Pokemon manga*!\nSo now that we\u2019ve hit $30k, I\u2019m going to spend the next few weeks playtesting the Myth Master rule set and refining it and then packaging it in an easy-to-understand PDF rule sheet that you can print out for free!\n(* in the Pokemon manga the objective of battle is often to kill the other trainer, it\u2019s pretty metal)\nAwesome, 10 more expansion cards added! We're now up to 70 cards in the expansion deck! But we also have a SPECIAL SURPRISE:\nWe've teamed up with our KICKSTARTER PALS, the Machine of Death, to release a cross-over game mode these special bonus cards only available to backers of both projects:\nThe Machine of Death card in Story War can be used to predict your opponent\u2019s death with just a single drop of blood; the Story War card in Machine of Death can be used to redeem something from a fairy tale. Both cards stand alone as usable items in both games, but they become even cooler when you combine the two games!\nCan a vampire die of cancer? What if it\u2019s sunlight from the Cancer constellation? Using the Machine of Death\u2019s cause-of-death predictions on fantasy characters adds a whole new level of creative challenge to the gameplay of both games! We\u2019ll post more about the crossover rules later on in the campaign!\nWow, we just hit our $40k stretch goal, which unlocks a 5 pack of campaigns! What are campaigns? They\u2019re a single sheet of rule variations that you can print out and read from top to bottom as you play the game. Here\u2019s some examples of what a campaign could contain:\nA choose-your-own adventure style storyline, that uses cards from the player\u2019s hands to fill in unknown variables, where the story\u2019s path changes depending on the outcome of the battle!\nA list of 20 numbered alternate victory conditions for battle (\u201cWoo the princess!\u201d \u201cWin an election!\u201d \u201cDefeat the opponent without drawing blood!\u201d \u201cWin a go-kart race!\u201d) that you could use with a 20-sided die!\nA one-time-use storyline that plays out like an elaborate shaggy dog story with a big twist at the end!\n\nThe best thing about campaigns? We\u2019ll be releasing some that we make ourselves, but players are free to create their own and share them with other players! We\u2019ll even come up with a convenient way for players to share their campaigns with one another.\nHow\u2019s that for re-playability?\nWait we - somehow hit THREE stretch goals in a single 24 hour period? How is that possible! So at $45k we unlock another 10 cards for the expansion, bringing us up to 80 expansion cards! There's only two stretch goals left before we have a full 100 card expansion deck!\nWe've also figured out a good solution for scaling up art production for our higher level reward tiers, so we've DOUBLED the number of available Magic Packs, which continues to be one of our most popular rewards!\nWhoa, we're halfway to $100k! That's so awesome!\nAt $50k we\u2019ve unlocked a new game mode called Conquest Kingdoms. This is a pretty big deviation from the way Story War is typically played! We wanted to make a game mode that focuses on Battlefield cards as more than just a background thing. So we came up with this idea: Let each team choose a Battlefield card that is treated as a base that the other team must capture. That means things like structural stability and environmental advantages and potential booby traps really come into play!\nOutside of the overall concept (which sounds super fun!) the specific rules for this mode are still up in the air! But now that we\u2019ve gotten $50k in funding, we can afford to actually playtest it and find the best possible rules! Once we\u2019ve finalized the rules for the Conquest Kingdoms game mode, we\u2019ll release them online for free as a downloadable PDF!\nWow! Heck! Wow! We went from $40k to $60k in 24 hours! Do you know what that means? We gained the entire necessary funding amount in a single day! The whole $20k, wow!\nWe also added 10 cards to the expansion, bringing us up to 90! If you want to join the discussion which cards we add to the expansion, head over to the comments section on update #7!\nHoly cow! $70k! in the first 10 days! That means we've unlocked new campaigns written by Cantrip Games, but ALSO we have an exciting announcement relating to campaigns:\nWe're going to build a website where users can write their own interactive campaigns that can be viewed on mobile devices. That is to say, when you're playing Story War with your friends in real life, someone could load CantripGames.com on their smart phone and you'll be able to jump right into alternate game modes and rules that are displayed right there on your phone! No printing necessary! Online campaigns can even even contain interactive components and rich media, like photos, video, and branching story paths.\nWe'll be putting all of our campaigns online for free, and also offer printable versions of ones that would make sense as printed versions. We're also going to make it so users can post their campaigns online for free! It's going to be really cool!\nWow, $80k, that means the expansion is complete! We now have a FULL 100 card expansion! This means you can play the expansion as its own game! We'll develop the expansions with the input from our backers, so be sure to check the updates section for more details! \n\"Objection! It's impossible that my client, the Vampire, could've killed the victim - the crime HAD to have taken place during the DAYTIME!\"\nTrial Tales is a Story War game mode we're developing that turns the concept of \"proving your character can defeat another character\" on it's head - instead the objective is to prove your innocence! It's like Nursrey Crimes meets Phoenix Wright!\nThe players on the left and right of the current judge act as the Attorney and Prosecutor who must defend Warrior cards that represent their client and the victim, respectively. Each subsequent player is a witness/suspect. The Battlefield cards art as crime scenes, and the Item cards act as evidence!\nStory War is largely about choosing your Warrior cards, but Trial Tales is all about evidence (Item cards). The prosecutor and defense attorney will have a hand full of evidence cards that they could choose to play or not to play, based on which ones they think would better suit their narrative. Remember, even if you're the one who submits an Item into evidence, it can still be used against you by the other side!\nWe'll be playtesting this mode until we have a solid set of rules nailed down, then we'll release those rules for free. Also $90k! We had a huge bump this week thanks to Hank and Emmy!\nHey, it\u2019s Tom here! Shortly after Brad pitched me the idea for Story War, I threw together an IRC bot that could play it. (IRC is a really old chat platform that nowadays is only really used by hackers and time travellers from the 90s) Even with no art, hastily-scrawled descriptions, and totally un-thought-out characters and locations, we realised this game was a blast.\nIt turns out that a heck of a lot of you think it\u2019s a pretty cool game idea, too, because as of just a little while ago two-and-a-bit thousand of you have helped us hit our $100k stretch goal - and we\u2019re not even halfway into the campaign yet! Amazing!\nSo, it means that, once the Kickstarter wraps up, I\u2019m going to start bringing this old IRC bot into the twenty tens, including lovely graphics, chat, and video! At the moment we\u2019re looking at building it as an add-on to Google+ Hangouts, which means the webcam-based communication elements will already be there for us; we\u2019ve just got to get the game happening!\nIt\u2019s going to be a fair bit of work, so it certainly not going to be live when the kickstarter ends or anything (plus I\u2019ve got to put together the print-and-play stuff first!), but we\u2019ll keep you posted on the progress. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll end up playing it with at least some of you, so I look forward to seeing you on Google+!\nWow, we hit that stretch goal super fast! To celebrate, here are a preview of four of our favorite items in the base set!\nNow that we've hit the \"base set upgrade\" we're going to include some of the features of the DELUXE PACK in the BASIC PACK: The basic pack will now include a sampling of blank cards that users can draw on, as well as it's own mini-comic that will contain different comics from the DELUXE PACK version. These rewards *stack* too, so if you ordered the DELUXE PACK you're also getting everything in the BASIC PACK as well, which means you'll have even more blank cards and even more comics.\n\"Medusa and the Gargoyle would be a PERFECT couple, come on! He's already stone, so she can't turn him to stone and her snake hair can't hurt him. His cold priestly heart would be warmed by her fiery diva attitude. Plus they look so cute together!\"\nKiss & Make Up is our newest game mode - another way to play with the Story War cards. Rather than trying to figure out \"who would win in a fight\" you're trying to convince another player to go out with you in a sea of competing suitors.\nIt's structured similar to The Bachelor - the 'judge' has a Warrior card that everyone else is trying to woo. Then every other player makes their case for why their Warrior is the best match for the judge's Warrior - and they can use Battlefield cards to suggest date locations, and Item cards as romantic gifts.\nThe Warriors are all fighters, the Items art mostly weapons, and the Battlefields are pretty hazardous - but volatile creatures need love too! Isn't that the whole point of Sex And The City?\nThe weekly webcomic has been unlocked! Which means we're going to start posting weekly comics featuring the Story War characters on the Cantrip Games blog! Comics will often be based on actual battles and they can even be submitted by players themselves! The whole world is a writer's room - any time you're playing a game of Story War, every single turn has the potential to become a comic that can be disseminated to other Story War fans. So that's pretty cool!\nStory War hit $180k last night, which means we\u2019ve unlocked a new Game Mode called Hero\u2019s Saga!\nThe basic idea is this: Rather than playing as a new Warrior every round, you play through the entire game as a single Warrior who gets stronger after every battle. There are two ways your Warrior can get stronger: By acquiring \u201cSkill Cards\u201d which are Warrior cards interpreted as learned abilities (for example, if you play the Red Dragon as a Skill Card on your Witch you could reasonably argue it gives her the power to cast fire spells) and by acquiring Item cards that could be re-used in every future battle without penalty.\nThis is our most ambitious and complex Game Mode yet! Once we\u2019ve thoroughly playtested it and worked out all the kinks, we\u2019ll release the rules as a free PDF to all of our backers!\nThat's it, that's the animated short. No I'm kidding the real animated short will be much more animated and much less short. But I am fairly certain it'll star these characters, all of whom have turned out to be fan favorites. We're already talking to some animators and voice actors and music people and animation studios. It's going to be an actual thing and you guys are going to love it!\nEndless Journey is a new game mode that pushes Story War a little closer to Dungeons and Dragons than Apples to Apples - you'll be playing an allied team of Warriors (decked out with magic items, of course) fighting \"against the deck\" rather than each other!\nEndless Journey will be developed with the intention of having it be played as recurring sessions with continuity between them rather than just a once-off game, and we'll be releasing updates once a month that will affect your epic as it develops!\nWe made it! The final stretch goal, until we demolished it way ahead of time and had to come up with extras!\nSo it looks like now we'll be getting the ball rolling in developing a mobile adaptation of Story War! We're not exactly sure what form it'll take just yet, as it's a pretty big undertaking, but we'll keep you posted as we figure it out!\nWe've received a lot of messages about using Story War in schools, and kid-friendliness was an intentional goal of the project from really early on! Now that it's been successful beyond even our most ambitious guesses, we're going to pay some of that good fortune forward by giving away a hundred copies of Story War for use in classrooms!\nPlease spread the word and try to get your friends to back Story War and help us reach these stretch goals! We can't do it without your help!\nThe song in the video is \"Jetpack Blues, Sunset Hues\" by Anamanaguchi, used with permission. All the artwork was made by Vondell Swain.

We've gotten some price quotes from a few major card printers and distributors and we are ready to start printing as soon as the campaign ends.\n \nThe only real potential setback is getting the art for the expansions done fast enough - especially if we get a lot of custom artwork orders. We've been talking to some people that we'd like to bring on board as additional artists so we can work faster, but we have to wait until after the campaign ends to get any formal deal in place.\n\nWe've also partnered with Breadpig, who have assisted with several large Kickstarter endeavors in the past few months - like Ryan Norths' \"To Be Or Not To Be\" book and Zachary Weiner's \"Science\" book.

Edwina Brasseldun, or the groundhog as her friends call her, is happier six feet underground than anywhere else on Rivet. Brasseldun is a subterranean engineer who cut her teeth working in the Timonium Spice mines. She is the foremost expert on underground transport and deployment. With her hit and run tactics she can tip the balance of any fight in her favor.\nBaron Munchen\nNot much is known about Baron Munchen. No one has ever see his face and it is not even certain if he has a face. The glowing liquid in his helmet conceals any hints that there might be a man inside. Some say he is the result of experiments gone wrong while others say he would be dead if not for that suit of his. What is known is that Munchen's suit makes him tough to kill. Artillery rounds have leveled dozens of his personal guard only to leave Munchen standing seemingly unscathed.\nIf we hit this stretch, we'll tool these nifty damage markers so you can easily see how much damage or what effects a unit is suffering from! All games upgraded!\nLt. Mcleod\nMcleod is a man that other men look up to. He is a commander who is always with his soldiers and will always be found at the front of a charge. Hailing from the Northern tip of Brighton, Mcleod will lead a charge by playing his grandfather's ancient bagpipes, lifting the spirits of those around him. It is said that the sound of his pipes can keep a man on his feet when on all accounts he should be down for good.

Leading this charge is Dr. Vorne, a physicist who wears the scares of his many failed experiments with radiation and nuclear energy.  He is well known to the allies for unwittingly pulling Atomic Robo into the world of Rivet, though even Vorne is not certain how that happened.  Though possessing great power, Vorne can sometimes be as dangerous to the Blight as he is to the Allies.\n*Ships Q1 2014.\nThe Red Baron\nTerror of the skies, Baron von Rivetoffen has more air victories than any other ace on either the Blight or Allied sides!  The Red Baron is awfully camera shy though, and has a strong aversion to scout planes...\nEvery Blitzkrieg level pledge gets a free Red Baron if we hit this stretch!\nReme Funck\nReme began his military flying career as a bomb thrower in a late model Bristol Tug. During a mission Reme's pilot was killed requiring Reme to take the controls and land the plane. Because of the shortage of pilots in the Nante area where they were fighting, Reme was promoted to pilot. He soon graduated to flying his own biplane and quickly demonstrated his aerial prowess by downing five blight fighters in a day. As one of the Allies' top aces, Reme is always a welcome member of any allied air group.\nThis is a purchase and stretch goal rolled into 1.

Sporting two turrets it excels at eliminating blight armor assets. Because of its cost it is not seen as often on the battlefield but when it does make an appearance it send the Blight running.\nGryphon's Hammer\nWhen the Rivet Wars became less static and the frontlines began to move day to day the large rail guns deployed by the Blight became obsolete. Under the direction of the Iron Chancellor, these guns were refitted with Heavy siege chasis. Although incredibly heavy the Hammer is quite mobile and considered a tremendous asset in breaking allied strongpoints.\nPneumatic Revolver Turret\nThis innovative turret grants any vehicle tremendous anti-infantry capabilities. Although it consumes a great amount of ammunition it is well worth it.\nGrenade Turret\nThis turret allows for the quick dispersal of smoke or fragmentation grenades for any vehicle. For close combat actions this a real game changer.\nOtto Kuleman\nConsidered a young prodigy, Otto was raised by his parents in the hills outside of Ballmore. There he enjoyed trips to the local tank factories and was hired as a driver. Once he was of age, Otto signed on as a tanker and quickly rose through the ranks. Today he is an officer of renown and any Blight tank crew would be honored to serve with him.\nWilliam \"Shady\" Durgle\nBorn on the Jersey coast of Brighton, William was always one to find the kink in the armor or the weakness in any design or situation. As a tank commander it is this skill which makes him unstoppable. Using tactics some would call unconventional, \"Shady\" uses his opponents' weaknesses to his advantage and avoids direct confrontation. He has never lost a tank or a single crew member in eight years of service. drawing the two heroes now\nThese bad boys will ship with the Battle of Brighton, Red Baron and Reme Funck in Q1 2014.

Her fierce combat skills are only matched by her beauty.\nThe Man In Charge - Some men are born to follow and some are born to lead. The Colonel, as everyone refers to him, is definitely the man in charge. When he walks into a room one can feel his presence. And the gaze of his eye is always scrutinizing his men, looking for any flaw, any weakness. When charging into battle, this is the man you want in charge!\n\nEvery game gets an upgrade with these two generals to plug into your tanks! (or plug turrets).\nGeneral G. Patston (Ally Plug Hero) - After graduating from East Point Military academy General Patston quickly rose through the ranks. Although known for his brash style and quick temper his success on the battlefield can not be denied. A cavalry man at heart, Patston is obsessed with mobility. He is a master of troop movement and is sure to get your men to front and into the fight!\nGeneral E. Romler (Blight Plug Hero) - Romler is a master tactician. He views the battlefield as full of opportunities waiting to be exploited.

When it's time to call in an artillery barrage Cher Ami is your best bet.  \nCapt. Elsa Frost (Blight Hero)\nNo one ever described Elsa Frost as warm hearted. She is more like a machine than a rivet. But this strong unbreakable presence has instilled a loyal fervor in her troops. When Elsa leads her soldiers into battle it is certain that they will be faster, stronger, or more accurate. One thing is for sure, you had better get out of her way! \nM7 B.O.S.S. & Doom Wheel - now comes with 3 each!\nM7 B.O.S.S.\nAfter seeing the effectiveness of the Blight Landkrieger the allies decided to accept proposals for a bipedal mechanized armored tank of their own. The winning design created by the Breton Forge Works built upon a large well armored core structure. This was supported by two hydraulically driven legs. Once fielded the B.O.S.S. became a welcome sight to the allies. Many a soldier has found himself rallying around a B.O.S.S. in the thick of battle.  \nThe Doom Wheel\nWith the monowheel drive system and suspension proving themselves to be both reliable and effective the Blightun Empire decided to repurpose this design for a fast moving gun platform.  The original monowheel parts were upscaled to support the increased armor, engine and ammunition being carried. The final vehicle is both effective at range and in close combat.  Monowheel Dragoons affectionately refer to the Doom Wheels as Big Brothers.\nDrop in alternates for normal Infantry, they're themed to match Baron Munchen and Lt McCleod who've just been unlocked!

It's a wifi-enabled, energy efficient, multi-colored bulb that you control with your iPhone or Android. LIFX gives you unprecedented control of your lights, reduces your energy costs, lasts up to 25 years and delivers an amazing range of experiences we think you\u2019ll love.\nSets up in Seconds\nLIFX is incredibly easy to set-up. Simply replace your existing bulbs with LIFX smartbulbs, download and install our free app from the App Store or Google Play and you're good to go.\n\nWe Need Your Help!\nWe [Phil Bosua, Andrew Birt, Andy Gelme, John Bosua, Ben Hamey, Dave Evans and Guy King] have designed, redesigned and reimagined LIFX many times during the past six months, pouring countless hours into thinking about the user experience, the technical aspects of the project and how to deliver the world's smartest lightbulb to you at an affordable price point. You can help bring LIFX bulbs to the world by being the very first to own them!\nWhat is LED Lighting?\nLED lighting is the future of home and commercial lighting around the world. LED's have reached a price point and level of consistency where they're now the best alternative to incandescent bulbs for their energy efficiency [they use approx. 1/10th the energy of standard household bulbs].\nThese bulbs will not only bring you a great experience, but are one of the easiest ways to reduce your energy bills and impact on the environment.\nIn addition they're unbelievably long-lasting. Just like standard LED light bulbs, LIFX smartbulbs are rated to 40,000 hour / up to 25 year standards.\nEnvironmentally Friendly\nLIFX is a revolution in home lighting and will allow you to save money and reduce your environmental impact. With up to 20% of homes power consumption coming from lighting, it makes sense to switch to LED technology and even more sense to switch to LIFX LED smartbulbs. But this is just part of the story, LIFX is about the experience.\nWhat can I do with LIFX smartbulbs in my house?\nControl your lights from anywhere\nChoose any brightness for a specific bulb, a room or your whole house\nCreate the colors to match any mood or decor\nGet notifications such as Twitter, Facebook, Texts and more\nReduce your energy consumption and save money\nVisualise your music with animated colors\nMake an impression at your next dinner party \nGet creative with colors and effects \nCreate a night light for your kids\nSecurity mode when you're on holidays \nCreate groups of lights \nRobot dance like it's 1999\nThere's many more things you can do with LiFX smartbulbs in fact we're creating a software developer kit (SDK) and a hacker kit so hackers and developers alike will be able to release more and more apps to do things we haven't even thought of yet.\nThe LIFX App\nThe free LIFX App will be available on the App Store and Google Play and we also have plans for a Windows, Mac and Linux app. If we achieve our goal we'll fast track the development of these apps across each platform.\nThe LIFX app is one of our favorite aspects of the entire project, and we've spent countless hours thinking about how you can interact with your lights. We have mapped out a very smooth configuration UX from the app to the LIFX master bulb. In essence you place your LIFX smartbulb into a light socket, turn the switch on and then launch the app. You will be guided through a process of choosing your home network from a list and then entering your password. The LIFX master bulb will then auto configure itself to your router and all the slave bulbs will auto connect to the master. If you add more slave bulbs down the track  these will also auto connect. Each smartbulb can be controlled individually. eg. they don't just mirror the master bulb.\nRegarding security: LIFX will be as secure as your WiFi network. eg. without the WiFi network password you can't control the smartbulbs.\nWe're aware that while the hardware is the most visible and interesting part of this project our software is the soul.\nWhat do I get?\nLIFX comes as either a single bulb or can be purchased in packs. Each LIFX bulb is ready to install straight away. Simply choose the type of bulb you need (Edison Screw, Bayonet Cap or Downlight) and you're ready. If you ever need to purchase additional bulbs, these all form part of your mesh network, meaning every LIFX you buy can be controlled via the same app without reconfiguring.\nWhat types of smartbulbs are available?\nBayonet cap [B22]\nEdison Screw [E27]\nDownlight [GU10]\nSome backers have recently asked for specific fixture model numbers.\nAfter the project has finished we will be sending out surveys to all KS backers asking which type of the above LIFX smartbulb casing you want. You will be able to mix and match bulbs styles in any combination. We are preparing more details on the above casings and other options that will be available in the next few weeks including dimensions and more. The more pledges we receive the more options will be available. Please direct message us if you have a preference for casing style/type that is not on the above list.\nThe Tech\nLIFX uses a master/slave concept to connect to your home router via 802.11n and then onto all the other LIFX smartbulbs via 802.15.4 mesh network. Each LIFX can connect to all country electricity systems from 110V to 260V. This includes USA, Canada, UK, Germany, France, Australia and 95% of other countries around the world. \nYour light switch needs to remain on for the smartbulb to be accessible with the LIFX app. However you can use any light switch to turn your smartbulbs on and off like you do with traditional bulbs.\nLIFX uses a mesh network. The standby power usage of each bulb is very small, in fact a AA battery would keep a LIFX smartbulb in standby mode for approximately 1-2 years. [note: The master bulb requires a WiFi connection which uses approximately 2-3 watts. Only 1x master bulb is required in each home/office.]\nThe LIFX prototype uses an RGB phosphorous COB LED lamp which is approx. the equivalent of a 60 watt incandescent bulb or 50 watt halogen downlight. We are looking into all the options on the best type/brand of LED lamp to use in the production model. Getting this right is something we are very passionate about. (real world comparison - actual lumens of LIFX rated at higher levels than 60w incandescent bulbs)\nWe couldn\u2019t have done this without our distributed systems hacker Andy Gelme who is the lead engineer on LIFX. He\u2019s been at the forefront of automation technology for many years creating systems that run on top of open industry standards.\nWe will be releasing a LIFX Software Development Kit (SDK) that will allow mobile App developers and home automation hackers full control over their LIFX smartbulbs. This includes using a small scripting engine that runs within the LIFX smartbulb. Stay tuned for more details. We can't wait to see what amazing hacks you come up with.\nWe have set up a LIFX Tech blog where you can interact directly with our lead software engineer Andy. Just pop on over to that page if you have some curly questions.\nhttp://tech.lifx.co\nComments\nWe are receiving lots of awesome comments. Keep them coming. One of our favs below.\n\"Out of all Kickstarter projects I have pledged for the LIFX is the first one which, when I showed my wife the intro movie, she immediately said \"Oh, I HOPE you're backing THIS!\" - so, LIFX is as of now officially WifeApproved (tm) in our home, which kind of makes me want to up my pledge to about three dozen lamps.\" - KS LIFX Backer - Nick Sakellariou\nEdits\n- On the back of questions and information we are receiving from the Kickstarter community regarding wattage and lumen output of bulbs in general we have adjusted the video to more accurately reflect this new information. One of the things we love about the Kickstarter process and community is it allows people like us to crowd source funding but more importantly ideas and smarts. We are committed to creating the worlds best smartbulb and will adjust our thinking and approach to achieve this. Given the overwhelming response to our project we are also now planning to hire the best darned LED experts we can find!! Thanks again for your support - we're glad we can share this journey with you.\n- Removed IPV6 from the main info page. Our aim is to use IPV6 but we prefer not to guarantee this until our development matures over the next few months.\nThe Internet of Things\nWe love the internet of things, home automation and the overall concept of the smart home but we also understand for most people it is a large chasm to jump. This understanding has been one of the guiding forces in the design of the LIFX smartbulb - to start with one commonly used household item and make it smart, easy to use and accessible to everyone.\nManufacturing \nLIFX Smartbulbs have been designed and prototyped in Melbourne, Australia and San Francisco, USA and we plan to manufacture via a trusted partner with operations in based in Melbourne and Shenzhen. We realise that whilst we're reinventing the lightbulb this doesn't mean we have to reinvent the manufacturing process. We are using as many standard LED lighting components as possible. These components have undergone rigid testing and stood the test of time. We are also very excited to create our own LIFX customised computer board \"the brains\" of this project. Also fully featured FREE apps will be available on the App Store\u00ae and Google Play\u00ae designed by Bonobo Labs.\nOur Vision\n\"LIFX answers a need that is well and truly overdue. Everyone in the world needs light bulbs. Existing light bulbs are based on an archaic technology that threatens our environment. Light bulbs consume approximately 20% of electricity in homes around the world. They need to be more efficient, smarter and last longer. In the twenty-first century, people need lighting that matches the \"smart culture\" and eco aware sensibilities of our day.\"\nPhil Bosua - Inventor of the LIFX smartbulb", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #35", "update_userinfo": "mini update - correct shipping addresses", "update_content": "It's been a pretty exciting couple of weeks at the LIFX office.

Players truck to various locations around America's Heartland, picking up and dropping off goods using matching cards from their hands. All locations have native goods that require fewer cards to load; other locations may pay a premium for those goods but may also require more fuel - and time - to get there with the cargo. With limited space in each trailer and only five cards in hand at a time, players will have to expertly manage their resources, as well as play the odds and press their luck to be the best trucker on the road.\nClick Here to Pin It!\nThe Great Heartland Hauling Co. will offer a lot of replay value through the use of cards to create a variable board set-up each game. The game will include 60 goods cubes, 4 thick cardboard trucks, and 46 resource cards - required for pick-up and delivery - that are drawn from a shared draft board, as well as 19 fuel cards, which are used to move about the Heartland. The cards and components will be of the same high quality as in Carnival, the first release from Dice Hate Me Games. The box size will also be the same, so you can easily take it with you on the road!\nThe Great Heartland Hauling Co. is a game for 2 to 4 players, ages 10 and up, and designed by Jason Kotarski. Hear more about Jason's design process and the development of the game on Episode 33 of The State of Games.\nIf you'd like to dig deeper into The Great Heartland Hauling Co., you can download the rules right here. Just bear in mind that we're still refining things a bit to make sure they are the best and clearest they can be. Also, we can always make the rulebook longer to make room for more advanced play and to incorporate some expansion ideas (with more components) that have been in development for awhile - if there's enough interest. Wink, wink, nudge, nudge.\nWe'll be working on a video tutorial to show exactly how you play, step-by-step, so be sure to check back for updates over the next couple of weeks.\nAchieving our base funding goal ensures that Dice Hate Me Games will be able to publish The Great Heartland Hauling Co. with the quality that we all have come to expect. But is the base game all there is to the trucking business? Well... definitely not!\nWe've reached our first stretch goal: The super sweet Truck Stops Inspansion! We're now adding 12 more cards to the box! The Truck Stop cards are randomized each game and allow players to purchase upgrades for their trucks; these upgrades grant players special abilities to give them an edge during the game.\nFor more information on our first stretch goal, check out Updated #5 right here!\nAnd now we've reached our second stretch goal - 18wheeples! That's right, we're adding four wooden truck meeples to every box of The Great Heartland Hauling Co!\nFor more information about our second stretch goal, check out Update #7 right here!\nAnd now we've reached the The Long Haul! Our final stretch has been reached, and we're making the game even bigger, with support for a fifth player and some new kinds of Locations cards!\nThis expansion for The Great Heartland Hauling Co. will not be included in the final retail version of the game, so make sure to pledge and then grab some friends to pledge, too! For more information about our second stretch goal, check out Update #10 right here!\n\"I don't know of another pickup-and-deliver game that fits into this same category of game length or weight, so The Great Heartland Hauling Co. is pretty unique in the hobby. It's a filler-length game that still manages to 'deliver' both with its depth and how well it pulls off the core mechanic.\" - Chris Norwood, GamerChris\n\"The Great Heartland Hauling Co. can be a fun and light game or a very serious and competitive one, depending on who you are playing with. When I played with the Parent and Child geeks, the game was about moving as fast as you could, and the players more or less stayed out of each others way. When I played with the Gamer Geeks, players were stealing goods out from under other players and hording them to ensure other players couldn\u2019t score points. In both cases, the game was well received and highly enjoyed. Although, I\u2019ll never be able to look at ham cubes on a salad again and not think 'pink pig chunks'.' - Cyrus, Father Geek\n\"It\u2019s really a game about careful planning, good timing, and a little luck combined with adapting your strategy. Your end game is really important, but be careful to get there at the right time. This makes it an interesting game. It\u2019s one I look forward to playing again.\" - John Moller, Cartrunk Entertainment\n\"The balance between a quick game and feeling like a game was actually played is difficult, and the designer did a great job of getting the balance right for this game. I borrowed the game later for a two player game with just Sam and myself, and I had a really hard time returning the prototype to Chris. I wanted to take the game home just so I could play it more.\" - Ken Grazier, Geek-Craft\n\"I got to play Heartland Hauling at WBC. It's like a light version of Steam. It's good.\" - Josh Edwards, Board Game Reviews by Josh\nKickstarter provides a platform for direct consumers to get The Great Heartland Hauling Co. shipped directly to their door before it hits the store shelves.

Accomplish various missions to unfold the story and gather materials dropped by defeated enemies to craft your weapon of choice. Any part of your weapon is customizable, each one altering the effect of your attack. Create an arsenal of weapons either to match your own play style or to match the challenge of a specific mission.\nMercenary Kings will have a strong focus on cooperative play. The initial version of the game will feature local 4 player cooperative play and will be available for PC. However, we are planning on supporting more platforms and online play if resources allow it.\nYou play as King, the most skilled mercenary on Earth, and you are sent to an island located in the Central American Pacific Coast to smash a ruthless criminal organization that assassinated your former team members. Your mission might be to save the Earth, but your own motives are to uncover the truth behind their intricate conspiracy and to get revenge for your fallen comrades.\nYou'll need skills, a sharp eye and lightning-quick reflexes. However, you won't stand a chance if you charge blindly. You'll need to be methodical and well prepared. That\u2019s why your backup is the world\u2019s best experts, ready and at your disposal to help you gear up for any mission. The Gunsmith can craft firearms of choice and upgrade your body armor, the Knife Expert can build deadly custom knives, and the Shopkeeper provides you with all the supplies you\u2019ll need.\nMercenary Kings features the art style of Paul Robertson, so be ready for spectacular animations and over the top characters!\nThe idea of Mercenary Kings was born back in 2010, as we were wrapping up Scott Pilgrim vs. The World: The Game. We had seen the potential and we were eager to make more awesome 2D games together. It took some time, but the planets finally aligned, and we gathered once again!\nMercenary Kings is currently in a prototype stage, meaning that most basic features have been implemented and are being tested, but it also means that most of its content still needs to be produced. The game will still change and evolve as it takes shape, but the core game mechanics are already well established.\nBackers will have access to a variety of rewards ranging from digital goods, to having an actual influence on the finished game. Higher tier rewards also include premium items such as a set of art prints, a t-shirt, a physical copy of the game, and a limited edition hoodie designed by Bryan Lee O'Malley! Their designs will be revealed in upcoming updates, so stay tuned!\nEarly Hoodie design - Subject to change.\nEarly T-shirt design - Subject to change.\nOur previous game, Wizorb was a success for a new independent game company like us, but it was a relatively small production and even though the revenues earned from it are good enough to allow us to fund another small production, they would not suffice to fund a more ambitious project.\nThis time, with Mercenary Kings, we want to bring our craft to the next level and develop a game to the full extent of our ability. In order to achieve that, we need a budget that will allow us more resources and a slightly longer production cycle. A solution could be to obtain funding from a publisher, but these kind of deals are hard to find and can be restrictive on the creative side. This is why Kickstarter seems like the ideal option for us. It would allow us to fully realize our vision while being able to get feedback from people who support us.\nIf we make it to the $75k milestone, we'll be able to make a version of the game that focuses on the features that are essential to make Mercenary Kings great. But ideally, to bring Mercenary Kings to its full potential, we would need $200k (which is still a modest budget for a video game production). So, listed below are all the features we're planning on developing depending on how much support we get.\n30 to 40 missions taking place on a paradise island under siege.\n4-player local coop mode\n20 to 30 primary weapon sets (guns)\n5 to 10 secondary weapons (knives)\nVarious materials to build parts\nBasic shop items (rations, first-aid, grenades, and more)\nMain NPCs (Colonel, Gunsmith, Knife Expert, Shopkeeper, Helicopter Pilot)\n15 enemies\n4 mind-blowing bosses\n4 color palettes for the main character\nAchievements\n20 to 30 additional missions (total of 50-70)\nAdditional primary weapon sets (guns)\nAdditional secondary weapons (knives)\nAdditional materials to build parts\nNew shop items (such as a riot shield, mines, rocket launcher, and more)\nAdditional NPCs (a Fashion Designer and a Cook)\nAbout 10 more enemies (total of 25)\n3 additional bosses (total of 7)\n4 additional color palettes for the main character (total of 8)\nMore Achievements\nThe full plot is unveiled!\n20 to 30 additional missions (total of 70-100)\nAdditional primary weapon sets (guns)\nAdditional secondary weapons (knives)\nAdditional materials to build parts\n1 additional NPC (Spy)\nAbout 5 additional enemies (total of 30)\n3 additional bosses (total of 10)\n2 additional color palettes for the main character (total of 10)\nTransceiver item and the ability to call for support (Colonel or Helicopter Pilot)\n4-player online coop mode!\nMore Achievements\nLeaderboards\nConsole version\n15-20 extra missions\nAdditional primary weapon sets (guns)\nAdditional secondary weapons (knives)\n1 additional boss (total of 11)\nMore character customization\nOn top of that, no matter how much money we raise, we plan on continuing work on Mercenary Kings even after its release in order to add more features from our wishlist. So, for example, if we reach our $75k milestone, we'll release a version of the game as described above but we'll use the money earned from the sales to work on updates that will add features of the subsequent milestones.\nPaul Robertson \u2013 Animator \u2013 The mastermind behind Pirate Baby's Cabana Battle Street Fight 2006, Kings of Power 4 Billion Percent, and art director on Scott Pilgrim vs. The World: The Game.

Each player takes the role of one of the Gods and battles to come out on top using various warriors based upon the Zodiac.\nKanzume Goddess is a deck building game in the vein of Dominion, Ascension, Nightfall, Tanto Cuore, and Thunderstone. As with those games, you are given a basic set of cards to start with and a field of other cards to purchase and build your deck. In this game, rather than compete for victory points, the goal is to deal damage to your opponents and knock them out of the game.\nWe discovered this game during our travels abroad and thought that it would be a great project to translate and bring over here. The artwork is all very nice and it's a pretty fun game to boot. We've seen a lot of interest in Tanto Cuore and its expansions and felt like it was time to try something new. We're already working on the translations and it's ready to go to print as soon as those are done so we're looking at a reasonably quick turnaround here.\nWhat Sets This Apart From Other Deck Building Games?\nEach player will be playing the part of one of the warring Gods, granting them access to powers that no one else at the table will have, making each player play differently. This game is also more adversarial than other deck building games. Rather than have the feeling that you are basically playing solitaire with several others, you will be battling one another to come out on top.\nContents\nWith each copy of Kanzume Goddess you will receive:\n90 Warrior Cards (18 types x 5 copies of each)\n90 Disciple Cards\n12 God Cards\n6 Life Counters\n1 Tin Box\nThe Rewards Tiers\n$10 Pledge Level\nYou will receive a copy of the Zodiac Button Set featuring artwork from the game as seen below.

BusinessWeek! The Verge! Wired! IGN! The New York Times! Time!\nWe love console games.\nThere's something about a big HD TV and digital surround sound that fills up a living room. Shooters, platformers, sports games, arcade classics and experimental indie games just feel bigger on a TV screen. It's how most of us grew up gaming. \nBut maybe people are missing out.\nWe get it \u2013 smartphones and tablets are getting all the new titles \u2013 they're \"what's hot.\u201d The console market is pushing developers away. We\u2019ve seen a brain drain: some of the best, most creative gamemakers are focused on mobile and social games because those platforms are more developer-friendly. And the ones who remain focused on console games can\u2019t be as creative as they\u2019d like.\nDeep down, you know your best gaming memories happened in the living room.\nYou busted your ass just to find out the princess was \"in another castle.\" You fought bosses that told you repeatedly how much \"you suck.\" You taped a blanket to half of your screen so your friend couldn't see where you were. You traded the best players onto your team just so you could have the perfect season. And you did it all on the TV.\nIt's time to upend console gaming.\nLet\u2019s open this sucker up! It's time we brought back innovation, experimentation, and creativity to the big screen. Let\u2019s make the games less expensive to make, and less expensive to buy. With all our technological advancements, shouldn't costs be going down? Gaming could be cheaper!\nWe're handing the reins over to the developer with only one condition: at least some gameplay has to be free. We borrowed the free-to-play model from games like League of Legends, Team Fortress 2, Triple Town, and many others. Developers can offer a free demo with a full-game upgrade, in-game items or powers, or ask you to subscribe.\nOUYA: The revolution will be televised \nOUYA is a new game console for the TV, powered by Android.\nWe've packed this little box full of power. Developers will have access to OUYA's open design so they can produce their games for the living room, taking advantage of everything the TV has to offer. \nBest of all, OUYA's world-class controller, console, and interface come in one beautiful, inexpensive package. All the games on it will be free, at least to try.\nGreat games come from great developers.\nDevelopers can wave farewell to the roadblocks of bringing a console game to market. Anyone can make a game: every OUYA console is a dev kit. No need to purchase a license or an expensive SDK. It's built on Android, so developers already know how it works. \nThat doesn't mean OUYA is an Android port. You can create the next big title in your bedroom \u2013 just like the good old days! Who needs pants!? \nOUYA could change AAA game development, too. Forget about licensing fees, retail fees, and publishing fees. \nAnd developers agree:\n\"This has the potential to be the game developer\u2019s console. It's about time!\" -- Brian Fargo (founder of inXile) \n\u201cWho wouldn't want a beautiful piece of industrial design that sells for $99, plugs straight into your TV, and gives you access to a huge library of games?\" \u2013 Jordan Mechner (creator of Prince of Persia, Karateka) \n\u201cIf OUYA delivers on the promise of being the first true open gaming platform that gives indie developers access to the living room gaming market, yes that is a great idea. We will follow the development of OUYA and see how it resonates with gamers. I could see all current Mojang games go on the platform if there's a demand for it.\u201d \u2013 Mojang (developer of Minecraft) \n\"I'm excited for OUYA! I am a firm believer that there is always room to challenge the status quo.\" -- Jenova Chen (thatgamecompany, creator of flOw, Cloud, and Flower)\n\u201cThe prospect of an affordable, open console -- that's an idea I find really exciting.\u201d -- Adam Saltsman (Semi Secret, creator of Canabalt)\n\n\"Our games will work so well on a TV, we just need an easy way to get them there. OUYA could be it.\" -- Marek Rabas (Madfinger Games)\n\n\"An open game console that gives independent game developers the flexibility to experiment with their games and business models on the TV, is something that's long overdue.\" \u2013 David Edery (Spry Fox, creator of Triple Town)\nDesign matters.\nWe believe a great console requires a great user experience. We are working with the award-winning designer, Yves Behar, and his firm fuseproject (designer of the Jambox).\nWe are designing the controller to be a love letter to console gaming. It will have everything you've learned to love: fast buttons, triggers, laser-precise analog sticks, a D-Pad \u2013 and it will have a touchpad for any games making the trek from mobile or tablet to the TV. It'll be just the right weight. We are working with select developers to play-test the controller through development.  We call it 'the Stradivarius of controllers,' and we hope developers will be inspired to take gameplay to a new level with it.\nHackers welcome.\nHave at it: It's easy to root (and rooting won't void your warranty).

What we have left to do is simple, but it's expensive. (We\u2019re looking at you Mark Cuban! Woz!

The application allows you to play pen & paper roleplaying games as well as strategy/board games online with other players from around the world. \nWith a host of useful features, we hope to support as many game types as possible:\nRobust dice rolling\nBattle maps with grid overlays\nTokens with editable fields\nMacros for storing frequently used commands\nCustom tables so you can roll from user created lists or card decks\nThese features, combined with the integrated video conferencing already included in Google+ Hangouts, provides what we feel is an experience that closely matches face-to-face tabletop gaming.\nWhy are you doing a Kickstarter?\n\nTabletop Forge started as a hobby project. While it is perfectly usable in its current form, we want to take it to a professional level. The primary use of the Kickstarter funds will be to purchase art assets to use directly in the application. Instead of hunting for an encounter map for that surprise tavern fight, we want you to be able to just choose a tavern map you like and load it directly in the app. We want tokens for all the generic fantasy creatures (like goblins), as well as modern/sci-fi tokens like guards and ships.\n\nBesides empowering players, we believe in supporting indie artists, writers and game designers. A large chunk of our KickStarter money will go back into the community, to people like Jonathan Roberts and Devin Night, so we can secure the rights to use their creations in Tabletop Forge.\n\nWe will also bring more programmers and designers on board to polish the features and user experience of Tabletop Forge and make sure it works smoothly and intuitively. Again, wherever possible we will hire from within, finding artists, designers, and programmers from within the RPG community.  \nSo what do I get for supporting Tabletop Forge?\nWe have a ton of excellent Kickstarter rewards including some fun maps, tokens, and other assets that will be available to backers only. If we hit our goal, we have plans to bring in new content like maps, tokens, and more as stretch goals.\nAfter months of adventuring you have reached the fabled Tabletop Forge and slain the blacksmiths who guarded it. As your reward, you may now take one item from their enchanted armory.\nWhy Tabletop Forge versus other virtual tabletops?\n\nWe admit there are other cool virtual tabletops out there but the primary reason we started developing Tabletop Forge was because of the awesome RPG community that exists on Google+. Even before the first line of code was written for our app, there were a steady stream of people playing pickup games on Google+ Hangouts using separate dice rollers. We wanted to give those gamers a tool so they could have the whole package in one place and solve the issues they were having. Now instead of seeing a handful of games a week we are seeing dozens, and that number is continuing to grow.\n\nThe main advantage of an online virtual tabletop is that it allows for games to be started quickly with no installation and port forwarding necessary. We also feel that our feature set matches up to some of the other popular virtual tabletops and we are improving the application daily.\n\nWe also have a lot of support from indie game designers evidenced by all the cool Kickstarer rewards they are offering. Our goal is to enable a wide range of gaming styles, and not tie Tabletop Forge to one specific system.\nFor example, although we have great map features (and more on the way), we do not want the app to revolve solely around gridded maps. We want to support features common to indie games like atmosphere, index cards, token/chit mechanics, and more.\nWe already have commitments that once we have an in-game store up and running, you will be able to purchase games, adventures, maps, tokens, and more from the game designers and artists for use directly in the app.\n\nNo matter what, Tabletop Forge itself is going to remain free because this is a product we feel that the community deserves and we want to encourage new gamers in the hobby.\nStretch Goals\nStretch Goal #1\nStretch Goal #2\nStretch Goal #3\nStretch Goal #4\nFinal Stretch Goal\nThe first part of this stretch goal is going to be a complete fantasy setting for use with Tabletop Forge along with 4 adventures. The fine folks at White Haired Man they are taking their system neutral setting Kith\u2019takharos and packaging it in a PDF for reference directly in the app. They are also taking 4 adventures (previously design for both 3.5 and Savage Worlds) and providing these for everyone who uses Tabletop Forge. As I have personally playtested a couple of these adventures I think they will be a great addition to our line up of great assets.\n\nThe second part of the stretch goal is going to be 20 issues of Toys for the Sandbox by Occult Moon. Toys for the Sandbox is an ongoing series providing system agnostic story hooks, locations, and NPCs in a framework designed to help a GM insert them easily into any game system. We will be getting a mix of fantasy and sci-fi issues and they will be available directly in the application for everyone.\nThe last part of this stretch goal is something we are personally excited about and if it happens will be bringing aboard a new member to the Tabletop Forge team. If we can hit this final stretch goal we will be including 3D dice that you can roll with the mouse complete with a physics engine. We think web technology is far enough along that we can attempt this and that this feature will help the application feel more like playing at a real tabletop. This kind of feature has been relegated to the desktop space in other virtual tabletops and we hope to bring it to the masses online.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"status": []}], "comment_no": 159, "projec_url": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/joshuha/tabletop-forge-the-virtual-tabletop-for-google-han", "project_name": "Tabletop Forge: The Virtual Tabletop for Google+ Hangouts"}}, {"backer": "Alexander Shen", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "If you miss the library, don't despair!

Brad Talton Jr. (BattleCON, Mystic Empyrean). He is joined on this particular project by artist F\u00e1bio Fontes (Mark PTO, Ranter Works). Several of the Microgames included as rewards for this project are contributed by Daniel Solis (Do: Pilgrims of the Flying Temple).\nLevel 99 Games designs games with the big ideas of replayability, approachability, economy, and innovation.\nReplayability - Each game in the minigame library has been played over and over again, but each is still requested by our friends on game night, at conventions, and over coffee for repeat plays.\nApproachability - You don't have to be a hardcore gamer to play one of these games, but they might just make you into one! Not just gamers, but non-gamer friends, coworkers, and even parents will be able to enjoy your minigames with you.\nEconomy - We don't fluff our games with excess parts, boards, or peripherals, instead making each game only as large as it needs to be. This fusion of elegance and economy allows us to bring you games to you that are \"bigger than the box\" without a bigger price tag.\nInnovation - Each game in the Minigame Library will force you to think differently from any game you've played before. While we stand on the shoulders of the giants of game design, we strive to leap as far as possible (and bring a hang glider with us) as we explore new game ideas.\nWe have a resum\u00e9 of quality games.

Turn everyday objects into touchpads and combine them with the internet. It's a simple Invention Kit for Beginners and Experts doing art, engineering, and everything inbetween:\nIt comes ready to use out of the box with everything you see above: MaKey MaKey, Alligator Clips, USB Cable.\nWhat Can I Make?\nThat's up to you! First, load up a computer program or any webpage (yes that's right, you're surfing the internet to invent). \nLet's say you load up a piano. Then, instead of using the computer keyboard buttons to play the piano, you can hook up the MaKey MaKey to something fun, like bananas, and the bananas become your piano keys:  \nOr let's say you Google for an online \"Pacman\" game and draw a joystick with a pencil (yes, an actual ordinary pencil):\nThen you can play Pacman by touching the drawing with your finger.\nOr you could load up facebook or gmail and send a message on a custom-made alphabet soup keyboard:\nHow Does it Work?\nAlligator Clip two objects to the MaKey MaKey board. For example, you and an apple.\nWhen you touch the apple, you make a connection, and MaKey MaKey sends the computer a keyboard message. The computer just thinks MaKey MaKey is a regular keyboard (or mouse). Therefore it works with all programs and webpages, because all programs and webpages take keyboard and mouse input. \nMake + Key = MaKey MaKey! \nWho is MaKey MaKey For?\nArtists, Kids, Educators, Engineers, Designers, Inventors, Makers... Really it is for everyone. Here is an 8-year-old girl in a Maker Space:\nShe invented a \"knife-and-log\" interface for cutting virtual wood in an online game.\nWe ran a workshop in February 2012 with some professors and grad students who specialize in interaction design. One grad student made this beachball game controller:\nAnother grad student made this working pressure sensitive switch by layering Play-Doh under a spring:\nThe workshop took place at Queen's University during a conference.\nWith MaKey MaKey, kids can start inventing right away, and experts can make working prototypes in minutes instead of days.\nWhat materials work with MaKey Makey?\nAny material that can conduct at least a tiny bit of electricity will work (if it doesn't already work, just rub it with bananas, spray it with water, or apply copper tape). Here are some materials people have used in our workshops including Ketchup, Pencil Graphite, Finger Paint, Lemons, etc.:\nOther materials that work great: Plants, Coins, Your Grandma, Silverware, Anything that is Wet, Most Foods, Cats and Dogs, Aluminum Foil, Rain, and hundreds more...\nRequirements?\nMaKey MaKey works with any laptop or computer with a USB port and a recent operating system. How recent? We have tried it with Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7, and Mac OSX.\nWhy Are You Creating MaKey MaKey?\nWe believe that everyone is creative, inventive, and imaginative. We believe that everyone can create the future and change the world. So we have dedicated our lives to making easy-to-use invention kits. We believe that the whole world is a construction kit, if we choose to see it that way.\nWe are inspired by the Maker Movement. We want to help people start to think of themselves as Makers and agents of change. When you have the \"Maker's Mindset,\" you know you can change the world.\nBefore we created MaKey MaKey we worked on other creative tools and invention kits such as Drawdio, Singing Fingers, and Scratch.\nWhy Are you Doing a Kickstarter?\nIf we raise $25,000 then we can do a large first run, which brings the retail cost down significantly, so that we can sell the kit to you for $35 (including shipping). We want this to be accessible to beginners, educators, artists, inventors, engineers, and anyone else regardless of income. \nWe are raising Kickstarter money to fund the first large run of MaKey MaKey kits. That is why most of the rewards are kits themselves. That's what we're spending the money on: manufacturing the kits.\nHave You Prototyped This?\nEverything in the video is real, running on either the first or the second prototype. Two years ago, we created the first prototype for MaKey MaKey, and ran a workshop at the San Francisco Exploratorium where people made \"Drum Pants\" and \"Tweet Tea\":\nThen we built the second prototype from 2011 to 2012, and we tested it with professional interaction designers. It looks like this:\nOur third prototype was just made, and will be tested at the Maker Faire and by 100 beta testers. It looks like this: \nNow we are designing the kit a fourth time. This will be the kit you, our KickStarter supporters, will receive. It will look mostly like the third prototype, with some aesthetic modifications.\nHow Are You Manufacturing the Circuits for the Orders Placed on Kickstarter?\nWe are collaborating with the amazing team at Sparkfun. Sparkfun is the perfect choice for us because they make safe, environmentally responsible (RoHS compliant) circuit boards. They are located in the USA (in Boulder, CO), and they treat their employees fantastically. Workers are paid a generous wage with benefits, can bring their dogs to work, listen to music while they work, etc. That may sound like it should be \"normal\", but in the world of circuit production it is very rare and there are lots of sad working conditions elsewhere. Also, Sparkfun is the world's largest manufacturer of Open Source Hardware, which is critical to MaKey MaKey, an all Open Source Hardware project.\nWe worked closely with Jim Lindblom and others from the Sparkfun team to get the board ready for manufacturing. We\u2019re grateful to have them as our partners in this project. With their help we will be done manufacturing and shipping by the end of August. They have a lot of experience meeting deadlines.\nWhat Does the Back of the Board Look Like?\nThe back of the board has hookups for 6 keyboard keys, and mouse control. It also has the open hardware logo, a link for help getting started, and an area for using the board in Arduino mode.\nWait... Is this thing an Arduino?\nYou could say this board is 2 for the price of 1. MaKey MaKey runs on top of Arduino. You can start using your MaKey MaKey board in \"Arduino mode\" at any time. This would allow you to spin motors, turn on LEDs, or anything else that an Arduino can do. If you want to learn to use Arduino or other electronics, but want to start without any programming or breadboarding, MaKey MaKey is a good starting point. There's no need to understand Arduino in order to use MaKey MaKey.\nSeriously, I Am a Geek, Tell Me All the Krazy Tech Stuff\nMaKey MaKey is a printed circuit board with an ATMega32u4 microcontroller running Arduino Leonardo bootloader. It uses the Human Interface Device (HID) protocol to communicate with your computer, and it can send keypresses, mouse clicks, and mouse movements. For sensing closed switches on the digital input pins, we use high resistance switching to make it so you can close a switch even through materials like your skin, leaves, and play-doh. We use a pull-up resistor of 10-50 mega ohms. This technique attracts noise on the input, so we use a moving window averager to lowpass the noise in software, saving money on hardware filtering. There are six inputs on the front of the board, which can be attached to via alligator clipping, soldering to the pads, or any other method you can think of. There are another 12 inputs on the back, 6 for keyboard keys, and 6 for mouse motion, which you can access with jumpers via the female headers. If you wish to use a different set of keys, or otherwise change the behavior of your MaKey MaKey, you can simply reprogram it using the Arduino environment. By cutting a trace on the back of the board, you can disconnect the large pull-up resistors if you want to, which would be necessary in a small minority of Arduino-style projects. Have more geeky questions? Post them in the comments and we'll answer them. \nOMG This Is Awesome Where Can I Find Out More?\nMaKey MaKey was at Maker Faire in the San Francisco Bay Area on May 19th and May 20th.

We love Larry\u2026Larry Laffer. We were there when he was born, in 1987. We were there for his last adventure, LOVE FOR SAIL, almost exactly 10 years later.\nAnd we\u2019ve long wished for a version that would combine the characters and game play we already love with:\nThe freedom to play on mobile devices\nA modern point-and-click/touchscreen interface\nUpdated, ultra-high res graphics\nFully voiced characters\nEven more of the humor that\u2019s made Al Lowe a household name\u2026like \u201cBorders\u201d and \u201cEnron\u201d!\nSo we\u2019re making it. From scratch. And we want YOUR help.\nDo you remember Lefty's Bar from the original?  Did you know it's famous?\nWe've already accomplished THREE of the hardest tasks (and one easier one):\nPrying the Leisure Suit Larry license out of the hands of Big Software. DONE!\nConvincing Al Lowe himself to come out of retirement for this top-to-bottom re-imagining of his 25-year-old creation. DONE!\nReaching our initial funding goal ($500,000) so that we can lock in the project. DONE!\nSetting ourselves a new goal of $750,000! so that we can add vastly more content and loads of incredible new features. Al, Josh, the Replay gang and Adventure Mob have a laundry list of bonus features, all aimed at adding length, breadth, and 500,000 new laughs to the original game. Some of the features we'd desperately love to add are: animated intro and cinematic cutscenes, maps, dialogues, more speech, foreign languages, Easter Eggs, minigames (in the LSL tradition: fun to play, easy to skip), new puzzles, new girls, new locations...and that's just the top of the list.\nWhat\u2019s in it for you? That depends on what you pledge in Larry\u2019s Kickstarter campaign!\nTake a look at the list of rewards we\u2019re giving to Larry\u2019s supporters. They include everything from a copy of the game to actually being PART OF the game \u2013 as a character! -- to actually going to Las Vegas with your very own private limo and villa on top of the world's coolest hotels with Al Lowe and writer Josh Mandel!\nThose rewards are cumulative. Pledge at the $100 level, for instance, and you\u2019ll not only get the $100 reward, you\u2019ll also get the rewards given for $50, $25, and $15 pledges. So your sack of goodies can fill up VERY quickly.\nNow, these rewards have never been available before, and will never be available again. They\u2019re strictly for this game, for this campaign, and every single one has been approved by Al Lowe. They are collector\u2019s items to commemorate YOUR partnership in gaming\u2019s biggest comeback EVER.\nSo please help us make LEISURE SUIT LARRY IN THE LAND OF THE LOUNGE LIZARDS: the 25th ANNIVERSARY EDITION a perverted, hilarious reality. Kick in now, and stake your claim in gaming history.\nThe team that created Leisure Suit Larry 1 has been reassembled to create a 2012 \"Reloaded\" version.  Al Lowe, Josh Mandel, Sabine Duvall, and Leslie Balfour have teamed up with Replay Games to form what we call \"The Dream Team\" of adventure games.  We'll be making Leisure Suit Larry 1-7 and keeping you guys informed every step of the way.  If this game is successful then we can bring you guys the rest of the Leisure Suit Larry games (and maybe even Leisure Suit Larry 4: The Case Of The Missing Floppies)! \nWe couldn't do it without you, the most loyal fans in video game history!!  We get all of your fan mail everyday and reply to as much of it as we possibly can.  This is what drove us to create this Kickstarter campaign.  Had we taken this idea to a publisher, they would've turned us down cold since they think adventure games are dead.\nSo, please help us make this a reality and bring Leisure Suit Larry back to his dad, Al Lowe, like he was intended.  We promise to keep you laughing and wetting your pants all the way 'till the end of the game!!!\nWhat happens if we exceed our goal?\nDepending on how far past our goal we get, here's the list of things we'd like to do with the extra development effort:\nFully localize all the voice overs in to as many languages as possible.  We will start with FIGS (French, Italian, German, Spanish) and then branch out from there.\nWe will shoot Leisure Suit Larry on to additional platforms:  XBLA, PSN, and of course: Linux!\nThe game will come to life with a live orchestra performing all your favorite Leisure Suit Larry tunes.\nWe got game!  When our funding goal is exceeded we plan on adding more rooms, more girls, and more lousy pick up lines.  We're basically making it bigger, badder, and uncut (that came out wrong but you know what we mean)!\nSincerely,\nAl, Josh, and the guys behind the scenes that are making this a dream come true for all of us!!!\np.s. we have 2 extra reward tiers but they are a bit too......\"outlandish\" to put in this official Kickstarter page so go here and we'll let you know what they are.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #71", "update_userinfo": "A Special Message from Al Lowe", "update_content": "Great news!

I knew they were good players after watching them record our soundtrack and this night cemented that reputation.\n\nBut the highlight for us Larryites came in their second set when they played several of the cuts from the Larry OST.

We\u2019re nearing the end of the project, and we want to keep you up to date with the information as soon as it hits our desk. This is in an effort to be as transparent as possible while creating what we hope is the single best Leisure Suit Larry project in the entire history of the franchise.\n\nI want to start off by thanking our 4k+ beta testers who have uncovered more GREAT bugs than any internal or external QA department I\u2019ve ever worked with in my entire career. This is largely in part due to the amazing work of QA Manager Jeroen Dekkers, and lead testers Tom King, Justin McMenamin, & badass \u201cwoman in gaming superstar\u201d Serena Nelson. Without each and every tester, Lead Tester, and QA Manager, the game would not be getting all the fixes you\u2019ve found and continue to find.\n\nHere\u2019s the problem, and thus this unscehdule Kickstarter update: due to the pure number of bugs found in the PC version alone (Mac version is being tested now,but not via Steam), we\u2019re having to delay the game, yet again, until the end of June. I can\u2019t tell you how many phone calls, arguments, and heart breaking conversations I\u2019ve had with my advisors on this. I SERIOUSLY wanted this game out by the end of May because we\u2019ve postponed it more times than Larry\u2019s been rejected. Ok, well, maybe not THAT many, but still\u2026.we\u2019ve had some delays.\n\nI want you to know this decision was not made lightly, and I\u2019ve consulted with advisors inside the company and outside the company\u2026with Al, Josh, distributors, our QA Manager, testers, marketing people, \u201cstake holders,\u201d board of directors, etc. The bottom line is, it\u2019s just not ready for prime time. Sure, we COULD release the game at the end of the month, but we\u2019d be shipping it with bugs. Things like: the wrong line being spoken, Larry walking through a table in the cabaret, missing sound effects in the tutorial, no music in certain spots, and Larry\u2019s scaling needing fine-tuning. While some of these may seem trivial, we have ONE SHOT at getting this game right, and it will set the bar for quality for all future Larry games to come.\n\nThe first one to bring up the suggestion of delaying the game was Josh on Thursday of last week. We\u2019ve fought, laughed, cried, and argued over what to do for two full days and came to the conclusion you\u2019re reading now. Josh offered to write this update to you since it was his original idea, but I told him \u201cthe buck stops here\u201d and it was ultimately my call, and my responsibility to tell you and the rest of the world. I am not proud of this decision, but -- and please trust me when I tell you this -- having considered every single possible outcome, I\u2019ve come to the conclusion that we need to give N-Fusion one more month to finish the game. There\u2019s a good possibility that we MIGHT be done before that, but we want to give the game enough time to fix ALL the bugs, and put as much polish on it as possible. Nobody is holding a gun to our head and saying \u201cYOU NEED TO RELEASE THE GAME FOR CHRISTMAS\u201d or anything like that. I\u2019ve always said \u201cwe\u2019ll ship it when it\u2019s ready,\u201d and it\u2019s simply not ready (as much as I wish it were\u2026.trust me).\n\nI\u2019m sure there will be community backlash and I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll get more hate mail because of this, but please understand, this really is the best thing for the game, for Larry, for future versions of Larry, and for you, the person who took a HUGE risk on us in hopes we\u2019ll deliver to you what you firmly believed to be the game we\u2019re making.\n\nI\u2019m sincerely sorry and I hope this decision is the correct one.\n\nThank you for reading, and I hope you understand.\n\nFrom my heart, "}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #63", "update_userinfo": "Unanticipated Update: The Leisure Suit Larry Beta Results", "update_content": "If you pledged at the $75 level or above, this update is for you.

Want to learn more?  Become a backer and read all about it in our Updates Section! \nGunship: First Strike is a tactical space combat game that uses Boards, Cards and Dice together in an innovative and exciting way.  Each player builds a custom Gunship, choosing Weapons and Armor placement to suit his tactics.   The Objective is the total destruction of the enemy Assault Carrier.  Guess what? They have the very same orders!  Engage in Dogfights and Strafing Runs with your Fighter Squadron and use your Gunship's Torpedoes and Bombs to pummel the enemy Carrier (if you survive the Defense Cannon barrage!)\nYour opponent has a Gunship and Fighters of his own, and will be trying his hardest to thwart your plans and destroy YOUR Carrier!  Both sides will deploy a variety of armaments with individual \"personalities\".  Blasters are the most accurate but do the least damage, while Ion Cannons cause lasting effects that slowly drive your adversary crazy!  Torpedoes are a sure thing, but if \"the dice are with you\" when you drop a trio of Thruster Bombs, you'll do maximum damage!\nGunship: First Strike has a unique damage tracking system where you can actually watch your ship get slowly banged up and cringe as important parts get shot right off!  When you take TOO much damage for comfort, or need to switch Weapons, land inside your OWN Carrier for a quick pit stop.  Restore your Shields, load up on Bombs, and get back into the battle - it's going to come down to the wire and EVERY TURN COUNTS!  Most battles are won by less than a handful of Hit Points.\nGunship has awesome artwork and a strong sci-fi theme.  It plays very quickly and makes a great game to \"kick off\" a night of heavier gaming or to play in a tournament or \"best 2 out of 3\" style.\nCheck out a brief Gameplay Summary on our website to see how Gunship works!\n                                                       and\n                      A bunch of illustrated Game Play Examples!\nGunship is for 2 players or two teams of 2 players each (using the 4-player expansion).  A typical game, including set-up, takes about 45 - 60 minutes. \nGunship was designed to be a FUN, light combat game but offers plenty of tough decisions and multiple ways to play your hand of cards.  Since every battle is completely different and you have so many choices of Weapons and tactics, Gunship has a high replay value.  What worked for you THIS time may not work so well in the next game!\nComplete information about Escape Pod Games and Gunship, including our full, downloadable Rulebook, is available on our website:\n                                www.EscapePodGames.com\n               Now, check out everything you'll get for Backing us!\nHere are some pictures of everything that has been Unlocked so far!

We have a manufacturing facility standing by to run 3000 units as soon as we secure funding.  We plan to take some time to finalize artwork and a few Rulebook revisions, and start sending everything out to our manufacturers in late Spring.  By August (hopefully sooner!) you should start receiving nice heavy packages in the mail!\nAll Kickstarter Backers will receive their games and promos well before the rest of the gaming community.  We will not sell Gunship to the general public until you have had time to show off a little first!\nI would like to take this brief opportunity to personally thank anyone who either has or is considering backing this project.

The number keeps going up and now the question is just how much news do we want to make with this? We're getting a lot of attention already and it seems like this little project could have an impact beyond itself. \nAll money raised will go to make the game and documentary better. Additional money means it can appear on more platforms, be translated into more languages, have more music and voice, and an original soundtrack for the documentary, and more!  We're still working to figure out exactly what we can offer, but we'll post more information as soon as possible.\nYour backing and comments have been truly inspiring to me and the team, so on behalf of Double Fine and 2 Player Productions I want to say THANK YOU!!!\nI can't wait to see where this thing can go!\nWelcome to the Adventure\nThe world of video game design is a mysterious one.  What really happens behind the closed doors of a development studio is often unknown, unappreciated, or misunderstood.  And the bigger the studio, the more tightly shut its door tends to be.  With this project, we're taking that door off its hinges and inviting you into the world of Double Fine Productions, the first major studio to fully finance their next game with a Kickstarter campaign and develop it in the public eye.\nDouble Fine Productions\nFounded in 2000 by industry veteran Tim Schafer (Day of the Tentacle, Full Throttle, Grim Fandango), the San Francisco-based company has established itself as a unique creative force with critically-acclaimed titles such as Psychonauts, Brutal Legend, Costume Quest, Stacking, Iron Brigade, Once Upon a Monster, and Double Fine Happy Action Theater.  This year, you'll be given a front-row seat as they revisit Tim's design roots and create a brand-new, downloadable \"Point-and-Click\" graphic adventure game for the modern age.\n\nWhy Kickstarter?\n\nDouble Fine\u2019s XBLA/PSN/PC title \u201cStacking\u201d\nBig games cost big money.  Even something as \"simple\" as an Xbox LIVE Arcade title can cost upwards of two or three million dollars.  For disc-based games, it can be over ten times that amount.  To finance the production, promotion, and distribution of these massive undertakings, companies like Double Fine have to rely on external sources like publishers, investment firms, or loans.  And while they fulfill an important role in the process, their involvement also comes with significant strings attached that can pull the game in the wrong directions or even cancel its production altogether.  Thankfully, viable alternatives have emerged and gained momentum in recent years.\nCrowd-sourced fundraising sites like Kickstarter have been an incredible boon to the independent development community.  They democratize the process by allowing consumers to support the games they want to see developed and give the developers the freedom to experiment, take risks, and design without anyone else compromising their vision.  It's the kind of creative luxury that most major, established studios simply can't afford.  At least, not until now.\n\n\nTim negotiates publishing rights\n\nKeeping the scale of the project this small accomplishes two things.  First and foremost, Double Fine gets to make the game they want to make, promote it in whatever manner they deem appropriate, and release the finished product on their own terms.  Secondly, since they\u2019re only accountable to themselves, there\u2019s an unprecedented opportunity to show the public what game development of this caliber looks like from the inside.  Not the sanitized commercials-posing-as-interviews that marketing teams only value for their ability to boost sales, but an honest, in-depth insight into a modern art form that will both entertain and educate gamers and non-gamers alike.\n\nAbout the Project\nOver a six-to-eight month period, a small team under Tim Schafer's supervision will develop Double Fine's next game, a classic point-and-click adventure.  Where it goes from there will unfold in real time for all the backers to see.\nTim\u2019s Project Lead debut, point-and-click classic \u201cDay of the Tentacle\u201d (1993)\n2 Player Productions will be documenting the creative process and releasing monthly video updates exclusively to the Kickstarter backers. This documentary series will strive to make the viewer as much a part of the process as possible by showing a game grow from start to finish, with all the passion, humor, and heartbreak that happens along the way.  Double Fine is committed to total transparency with this project, ensuring it is one of the most honest depictions of game development ever conceived.\n\nThere will be a private online community set up for the backers to discuss the project with the devs and submit their thoughts and feelings about the game's content and direction, sometimes even voting on decisions when the dev team can't decide.  Backers will also have access to help test the game once a beta is available.  Once the game is finished, backers will receive the completed version in the available format of their choice.\nFor fans of adventure games, this is a chance to prove that there is still a large  demand out there for a unique medium that inspired so many of us.\nRewards\nThis whole experience is being offered for the flat backer contribution of $15.  We believe that beyond the reward of receiving the finished game, the ability to be a participant in the project makes this a unique opportunity.  \n\nFor anyone who wants to contribute above and beyond the call, we have a selection of premium rewards ranging from a download of the full documentary series in splendid 1080p HD video with bonus footage, to unique posters, original concept art, and even a mini painting of yourself done by the game's artist!   \nFor those of you who want to be really special, check out www.doublefine.com for details on super premium high level rewards!\n\n\n\nClosing\nFor anyone interested in the inner workings of the game industry, either professionally or as a fan, this project will be a landmark in exploring the art of development.  For people that just love great games, this is an opportunity to help bring one to fruition.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #58", "update_userinfo": "Your Final Rewards are coming + Double Fine Adventure: Definitive Edition", "update_content": "Hello, Backers of Adventure!\nI love you!\nSorry, I got a little emotional there.

And best of all, if you could play with that? Well, if you like the idea of the twittersphere becoming a virtual universe, this is for you.\nWelcome to Tweet Land, the first set of videogames that plays with reality.\nThis project was born because we always thought that it would be really fun if what people comment in Twitter could turn real. You know, from the serious stuff twitters sometimes talk about, to the really nonsense tweets people make daily. So we decided to start working on this idea, and that\u2019s how Tweet Land was born. We have now advanced a lot and are really excited, but our resources are limited. So we need your help to make Tweet Land what everybody of us dream of. \nIn this universe you will be able to play several videogames. Tweet Land will be launched with two initial games. A racing game called Route 140 and an action game called Love City. Check out the video to watch the action gameplay. Hope you like them. Enjoy!\nThe game works really simple. Every time someone in the world tweets something, his or her tweets could affect the gameplay of Tweet Land by triggering certain action-keywords. It could be a \"car accident\" in your racing game, it could be your hate-gun gets reloaded in the action game, it could be anything.\nWe have created tons of situations that are triggered by their relative keywords that people might tweet. Some of them are:\ncar accident\nmeteor\nshooting star\ntsunami\nvolcano eruption\nfireflies\nzombie\nbeach\nlove\nhate\nshotgun\nlightsaber\nWe have many many more, but we don\u2019t want to spoil your game. And we will create even more. Many will be based on trend topics, many on actual events, and many others will be odd stuff people tweet (you know that happens a lot!).\nThe sweet part comes from the fact that people around the world are always creating tweets for the game based on their real-life experiences; even if they are not playing; even if they don\u2019t know anything about Tweet Land. So the events and the gameplay are always changing within the web and its thousands of conversations.\nTweet Land is the first set of videogames that plays with reality, making it different every time you play and endlessly replayable. Its main features are:\nWe have plenty of Tweet Land done. But we have many more work to do and many things to pay for. We plan to launch Tweet Land before mid 2011, for iPhone and web browser with two initial games. One of the games is a racing game called Route 140 and the other is an action game called Love City. With your support we can:\nsecure the ongoing development and multiplatform release\npay the dedicated servers necessary to run the Twitter integration correctly\nbuy software licenses\nand lock the Beta-phase so we can launch on date\nAs some of the rewards, we are giving to every pledge of $5 or more a pre-order of the game so you can download it when it is ready, and for every pledge of $15 or more we are giving Tweet Land beta-test access before the game is on public release so you can help us build it with your ideas. Check the other cool rewards on the top side-bar.\nWe are a group of friends from sunny Costa Rica that all of our lives have been really passionate about videogames and the web. For this reason every one of us has specialized since years ago into web/software development, graphic design, audio composition, e-marketing, social media and digital creativity.

There are several ongoing game related community events in the Bay Area that need a reliable and free space to continue their missions of bringing people together. That means LAN parties, demo scene events, and artist talks.\nWe've already got a storage locker full of artifacts and a community of dedicated individuals working to make The MADE a reality. We've also been deemed a not for profit by the IRS. Now we just need a space.\n100% of funds raised here will be spent on rent and monthly incidentals (power, internet, etc.).\nWe pledge that your funds will only be spent on the space itself, not on anything frivolous like big tv's and projectors (got em already).

We are Actors at Play, a group of artists who have decided to embark on a true labor of love. We're creating a show entitled BEWARE OF CUPID, based around Valentine's Day and made up of all original pieces related to the themes of love and relationships. The production is set for a 3-week run at The Actor's Playpen in February 2010.\n\nBased in the Los Angeles area, all of us in the cast are actors and/or work in the entertainment industry. Although LA is where you're supposed to pursue a career in film and television, theatre is an important part of our lives (and how we all met)! For the first time, we're challenging ourselves to put on this independent production to see if this might be the first of more to come, and because we know that, all logistics aside, we just want the opportunity to create a truly fun and moving experience for both ourselves and our audience.\n\nWe're self-producing this project which means we're digging into our own pockets. We aren't just the actors in the show, we're also the production team! Because we wholeheartedly believe that we'll be able to create something truly amazing, we have dedicated our time and commitment and talent to this project.\nCUPIDS' AIM\n\nWhile developing a concept for the show, we imagined Cupid not as a single entity, but a variety of cupids. Some may be earnest, while others may have a few tricks up their sleeves. And what happens when a cupid is disgruntled or gets rejected?\n\nIn our show BEWARE OF CUPID, we'll present original scenes and monologues that deal with the different aspects and manifestations of love. What is it like when you really fall in love for the first time, when you struggle to make a relationship work, when you have to get over the one that got away...?\n\nCome see the show in February and view the aftermath of our cupids' work. Maybe you'll laugh, maybe you'll cry, but there's one thing we can agree on... love is pretty complicated!\nBE OUR VALENTINE!\n\nWe've set our Kickstarter goal at $3000, which will basically cover the cost of renting our theatre space. So you are, in a way, helping to provide a home for our show while receiving some fun rewards for yourself. Putting on a show is no easy feat, but we're willing to struggle through the process in order to create something that we can share with our friends and family... a valentine if you will.
