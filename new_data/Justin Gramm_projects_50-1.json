Featuring 100% new questions never seen on the show before!\nUm, Actually presents you with statements about the fictional worlds of popular movies, TV shows and books. They all sound right... but listen carefully, because each one has a mistake hidden in it somewhere! It's your job to figure out what's wrong and announce it before anyone else, starting, of course, with the magic phrase: \"Um, actually...\" \nBut even if you know nothing about Sailor Moon or Star Wars, you'll find yourself making wild guesses, stumbling into answers, and having laughs along the way!\nCheck out this episode to see how a game goes down:\n\nWe\u2019ve got lots of exciting stuff planned for this campaign! \nOver the next few weeks, we\u2019re going to be building a custom deck of questions with input from you, the backers, so don't forget to GET IN THE COMMENTS! We\u2019re calling it the Community Deck, and it will be included in every copy of the Community and Deluxe Editions of the game.\n\nHere\u2019s what you can look forward to in the coming weeks:\nThese weekly polls will pit card ideas against each other and call on you to vote on which one you would rather see in the Community Deck. Would you rather have John Woo or John Wick? Cloverfield or Garfield? Each week we'll do an update with a link to a poll where you can make your voice heard. Sweet democracy in action!\nEach week, we\u2019ll issue challenges that will allow you to offer your support for one of two categories you\u2019d like to see in the Community Deck. You might be asked to act something out, take a crazy photo, or even cobble together a quick cosplay outfit. Check in each Wednesday to learn about that week\u2019s challenge, then get creative and post your efforts on social media!\nWe\u2019ll be announcing a new engagement piece every Friday, each one designed to test your knowledge of all things nerdy! From getting in the game, to scoring some swag, engage with your fellow nerds and get rewarded for it. \nWe can\u2019t wait to see what you guys come up with!\nNot convinced by our fancy graphics and flashy video? Well, we asked our friends to say nice things about the game... so let's hear what they think!\nPLAY\n\nNot familiar with the show? Watch some clips and full episodes below!\nYou can watch every episode of Um, Actually - along with exclusive series like Dimension 20 and Game Changer on CollegeHumor's streaming service, Dropout.tv. You can also watch a number of classic free episodes on the Um, Actually YouTube channel.\n\n\nIf you're one of the awesome folks who backed a previous Wiggles 3D Kickstarter project, such as 5-Minute Dungeon or 5-Minute Mystery, we'd like to express our heartfelt thanks.\nThanks. No, really. Thanks so much for supporting us!\nAnd as another way of expressing our gratitude, we'd like to offer each and every one of you a free 2-month subscription to Dropout and a CA$ 5 credit, which can be applied against shipping charges or add-ons in the pledge manager after the campaign!\nDropout is College Humor\u2019s premier content streaming service, with lots of great shows like Dimension 20, Game Changer, and of course, Um, Actually!\nYou'll be able to claim this gift at the end of the campaign, when you complete your backer survey.\nLimit one per returning backer.\nWe will be charging shipping once the Kickstarter is over as part of your backer survey in BackerKit. \nWe will be shipping from depots in the USA, Canada, the UK, Germany, China, and Australia. We'll choose the nearest depot to you to minimize the chances of additional duty and taxes. Shipping to countries other than the ones where we have depots may result in additional charges out of our control. Please research import regulations to learn about these potential costs for your country before placing an order. \nEuropean and UK VAT and Canadian HST are included in the shipping charges given below. \nEach pledge must be shipped to a single delivery address. We cannot split pledges to ship to multiple addresses.\nActual shipping costs are higher than our charged rates. We subsidize shipping to keep rates affordable for backers.\n\nCurrency Conversions\nRemember that your pledge is in Canadian Dollars, and your card will be billed in Canadian Dollars when the campaign ends. Currency exchange rates change regularly. Look at your local currency exchange rate toward the end of the campaign for the most current price.\nOnce again, we'll be partnering with BackerKit to make it much easier for backers to manage their pledge choices and shipping information.\nAfter the campaign ends, we'll send you a BackerKit survey asking you to provide your shipping information so we can get your rewards to you. You'll have the opportunity to add more copies of the game... at the same price as during the Kickstarter.\nIf you operate a game store and think that your customers would love Um, Actually, we'd love to hear from you!

We celebrate simplicity and smart design.  With four successful 30\u00b0 Ruler Kickstarters, 6,500 ecstatic backers, and 20,000+ delivered products, we\u2019re back and better with the 30\u00b0 Ruler 5.0!  \n\nWe believe life is best when simple things work...\nWhen we create our designs, we use various tools-some basic, some advanced. In the midst of design work on others, the humble ruler came to our attention and we began to look at one of our most used tools in a new light.\n\nWhat\u2019s special about the 30\u00b0 Ruler?\nSometimes all it takes is one great idea to revolutionize a product. For the 30\u00b0 Ruler, it was a simple elevation. By lifting the slope on the ruler\u2019s face by 30\u00b0, we\u2019ve made it easier to use, and we\u2019ve expanded what you can use it for. It\u2019s simple but effective \u2013 that\u2019s what Orangered Life is all about.\nWith a 30\u00b0 slope, you can read the measurements from a glance without having to lean over to use the device. So you switch from a tilted neck to a tilted ruler \u2013 keeping your back straight and your eyes on the target.\nThe elevation also allows for easy grabbing, without having to drag it towards the edge of the table or dig your nails underneath it. Finally, the angled nature of the ruler makes it safe for cutting.\nAlongside simplicity, we believe clarity is key. The 30\u00b0 Ruler does away with teeny measurements, instead opting for large fonts and clear indications. This means you can read the measurements from a distance, and you'll always be sure to find your mark.\nApart from its signature sloped design, the 30\u00b0 Ruler also has a couple of new features.\nThis 2-in-1 ruler has millimetres and centimetres on one side, inches on the reverse. We've labelled them in the same direction allowing for easy conversions.\nThe 30\u00b0 Ruler is designed to eliminate the confusion and strain of reading your typical ruler,  so every tick mark is labelled. \nOn the Imperial measurement side, all hash marks are labelled to eliminate guessing and counting of lines.  \nOn the Metric measurement side, both the millimetres and centimetres are numbered and the hash marks rise and fall making it easy to identify specific millimetre measurements.\nThe 30\u00b0 Ruler starts at zero. It is another simple design feature meaning you can start measuring from the very edge of the ruler instead of having to make adjustments for the useless blank space before the laser engraved measurements.\nThe ruler itself is made from aerospace-grade aluminium while the measurements are laser targeted. In addition to making it more durable, the advanced materials make the 30\u00b0 Ruler more lightweight and scratch-resistant.\nWhat\u2019s New\uff1fNew Color. New Size.\nThe ruler also comes in four sizes of 15cm/6inch, 20cm/8inch, 30cm/12inch and 45cm/18inch; so you can choose the right sized ruler depending on what you\u2019re measuring.\nThe new colour was one of the biggest asks we got from our previous backers. And we don't disappoint our backers! We exist because of you guys, so we're proud to offer the new colours and new sizes.  Not sure which you like? Don\u2019t worry about that yet! You will get to select your colour choice at the survey time.\nReward\nTimeline\nThank You\nWe love sharing our passion for this ruler.\nThrough Kickstarter, we can cordially invite you on our journey and share with you the manufacturing process. We are passionate about what we do, and the opportunity to serve you and bring such a fantastic product to market has been an incredible adventure.\nThis project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 1,100+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $460M raised between them.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOne primary challenge of this campaign is making sure that our product stands up to the tough quality assurance standards we have set.

Every package comes with standard tracking, e-mailed to you the moment the label is printed. To ensure best-practices as far as fulfillment is concerned, we ask that you read this VERY CAREFULLY before ordering.\nDIGITAL DOWNLOADS\nDigital files are sent out 24 hours after we receive our funding, which is typically 14-17 days after the last day of the campaign. These are e-mailed to the address on file and are valid for 7 days. Any extension of this is subjective.\nWe will not be mailing out links after 31 days.\nNo questions asked, no extensions past this point.\nTo ensure that you receive the necessary e-mails that contain these links, DO NOT block, filter, or unsubscribe ICONIC COMICS, KAMEN AMERICA, WETRANSFER, or ORANGEDOX.\nNew to this year is a tracking function that we have backstage that allows us to see download activity based on the e-mail addresses that the link is sent to. We reserve the right to terminate any current or future download ability based on unusual spikes in downloads coming from certain e-mail address. We are aware that people like to enjoy books on multiple devices, but it is at our discretion to evaluate individually any cases that seem to suggest piracy or link sharing.\nSHIPPING\nAll physical items come with an automatically generated tracking number e-mailed to you once the label is printed. We will offer replacements for any lost or damaged item. We will NOT offer refunds / replacements for books that we track as \"DELIVERED\", as it is your word against ours that any form of theft has occurred. Should this happen, please file a complaint with your local UPS / USPS / FEDEX provider.\nWe are not responsible for missing parcels after 3 months from the day they are sent out: that is when tracking information is no longer available to us, and it becomes the customer's word against our fulfillment that a package was not sent. Please read our fulfillment policies very carefully so that there is no confusion later on.\nWe also cannot guarantee the sending of products 3 months after the last package is sent out. Part of our on-time delivery is that customers are responsible for filling out their surveys in a timely manner. We cannot hold on to parcels on behalf of extremely late readers: at some point, we liquidate our stock to make room for new books. While we try to accommodate late surveys, we cannot guarantee either the quality of the book sent or that there will be books available at the time the survey is completed. PLEASE FILL OUT YOUR SURVEY ON TIME. MONITOR ALL UPDATES in the month of expected delivery.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have minimized risks over the last 2 years of crowdfunding by being very transparent with our policies and fulfillment procedures on our campaign pages.

In case of them not being active, they must be carried in the Item Bag taking up one space.\nThe player that uses more than one spell must choose which one to use when their action is performed.\nSkills\nBefore performing any action, the player must decide whether to use or not the Skill.\nThe Skill, just like Spells, will cost Power and the player will benefit from its stats when attacking.\nElite and Boss Skills\nThe deck corresponding to the enemy is prepared.\nA card is revealed each turn of the enemy and that card\u2019s action is performed.\nIf the Skill persists through various turns, the card is put aside, placing Time markers each turn of the enemy until the effect disappears.\n\n\nAs promised on the campaign comments, here is a video of the game captured on TableTop Simulator (TTS). Due to the current Co-VID situation, inviting unvaccinated people from outside JanduSoft, and without an antigen or PCR test would be irresponsible on our part, so that is why we decided to record the game using TTS instead of our printed prototype.\n\nInitially, our idea was having this video uploaded a couple of days ago, but we had an issue with OBS and we did not record the correct audio output, so the only voice in the video was that of the host of the game, and not the four invited players. So last night we gathered four players that worked with us on another playing test session, and this is the game we have uploaded.\nTablet Top Simulator gameplay of MiniQuest Adventures\nTake a look at the video here.\n\nOnce again, since this project has escalated so much, we didn\u2019t have time to script the TTS because it was not our priority, and the game is in a non updated version that we use for testing.\n\nNonetheless, we considered that it would be good to share this TTS game with our community so you can give us all the feedback you can. So the game will be available on the TTS workshop. (An early version, without the extras we have added throughout the campaign). If someone is interested in scripting it, please contact us. \n\nPlay MiniQuest Adventures on Tabletop Simulator\nPlay MiniQuest Adventures here\nThis is not the final version, and has been cut by hand, so we can assure you that although it looks good, the final product will be much better. The colors might be different to the final ones since the prototype has been printed in matte, and the final version will be printed in glossy paper.\nWhen we have the final prototype in our hands we will post an update on the campaign to show the difference in the current finishes and the final ones, and also show you the size of the game inside the box-\nA lot of things inside the box\nTypical game setup\nPLAY\n\n*Handcrafting the prototype tokens\nDiscover the Heroes\n\n\nMartina is a Human Sorceress that takes advantage of her great power to cast devastating spells.\nHer innate ability will allow her to recover power as long as there are enemies nearby.\nDurlan is a relentless Explorer Elf that will take advantage of his movement to get out of harm's way when convenient.\nHis innate ability will allow him to deal deadly blows to his enemies.\nFaenala is a Dwarf Paladin that will do all it takes to protect her companions.\nHer innate ability will allow her to charge at her enemies although wearing a crude and heavy armor.\nRalen is a combat-skilled Human Barbarian seeking glory for his tribe.\nHis innate ability will all allow him to strike multiple enemies with a single attack.\n\n\nIf you like what you see, tell people about it!\nSpreading the word about the game is the best way to help it achieve the kind of success needed for me to produce more material and products for it. \n\nHere are some suggestions:\n\nBecome a Fan on BoardGameGeek \n Retweet & Like on Twitter \n Share & Like on Facebook \n Like & Comment on Instagram \nWe're happy to be working with Backerkit again as our pledge manager to help with your pledge and process accurate shipping fees.

They  are perfect to pull out when your players unexpectedly take a casual  comment for a story hook and you need an adventure idea, or for planning  what dangers lurk in your kingdom. You may even chain several together for an entire campaign!\nEach poker-sized card has a map on one side and a mini-adventure outline on the other side. The outline starts with a short description for the GM.  (Skim these to find an adventure that fits the circumstances.) Choose  between a couple of story hooks to get the adventure started. Next several encounter ideas move the game along. Customize them to match what your players do (drop some, change them to fit circumstances). Finally each card wraps up with one or two follow-up adventure ideas.\nWe've made 11 of these decks over the past few years, and now we're planning four more:\nStretch Goals\nFriendly Shipping\nWe have friendly shipping for the US, Canada, EU, UK, Australia, and NZ thanks to distributors in those countries. See \"Shipping\" below for details.\nMore About Each New Deck\nOver 50 cards of Monster Hunts & Lairs!  While  each will have a couple of unique ways to get the adventure going, these will also have a couple of cards dedicated to which creatures provide what magical effects (sorted by power/challenge) when crafting  magic items or powerful spells.  So if the characters plan to create an item that confers increased flight and regeneration, you'll have a couple of quests to find creatures with those abilities. Each sidequest card will also suggest alternate monsters for the adventure.\nThe Coastal Town Sidequest Deck has 51 mini-adventures designed to play out in a fantasy coastal area, with the adventure outline on one side and a relevant map on the other. The quests center on several VIPs in town who need help with various enterprises as well as threats off the coast & nearby caves. While the sidequests can stand on their own, they are also tailored to match the Coastal Townsfolk NPC Portraits Deck. Each numbered sidequest could involve an NPC of the same number in the NPC deck (though the sidequests do not mention them by name, so you can substitute in your own NPCs). The NPC decks are available as add-ons through this Kickstarter, see below.\nWe also made a deck of Frontier/Mining Townsfolk NPC deck in a previous project. Like the Coastal Town Quests deck, these mini-adventures use the characters from the frontier townsfolk deck, but they aren't required--fill in your own locations and characters as desired. The quests in this deck focus on the mines & a cult near town as well as several tasks key residents need help performing.\nThese 50+ sidequests focus on historical mysteries and lost artifacts of the real world. Perfect for a campaign of tomb raiding or following up on lost crusades.  While most are set in the first half of the 1900s, as outlines they are easy to move to other time periods or even different worlds & genres.\nVirtual Table Top Maps\nYou'll also get PNG versions of any maps we create so you can easily share them with your players--or print larger versions.  For example, we make any battlemats at a scale of 75 pixels per square.\nSamples\nTroll Stew, card 14 from the Monster Hunts Sidequest Deck\nSummoning Gone Awry! card 08 from the Monster Hunts Sidequest Deck\nBy The Rockets Red Glare, card 23 from the Monster Hunts Sidequest Deck\nThe Mummy Menace, card 36 from the Monster Hunts Sidequest Deck\nThe Price of Power, card 14 from the Coastal Town Sidequest Deck\nPocket Full of Trouble, card 18 from the Coastal Town Sidequest Deck\nStuffed to the Gills, card 28 from the Frontier Town Sidequest Deck\nLoot Tunnels, card 33 from the Frontier Town Sidequest Deck\nReviews\n\"If you are a game facilitator that enjoys creating within a confined  space, I think these products will appeal to you. The outlines are  enough to keep you moving forward for a night of play but have enough  room to add your own traps, puzzles, monsters, or mechanical widgets  that I feel they can make for a comfortable backboard to bounce ideas  against.\" --Gnome Stew\n\"On each of these cards you\u2019ll find what you need to fuel a session,  if not several\u2013it\u2019s not every day you can get a year\u2019s worth of  adventure ideas in a single box\" --Bell of Lost Souls \n\"Highly recommend checking them out... If your players need a break from the main story line of your campaign, give these Sidequest Decks a show.\" --A Pawn's Perspective\nPrior Sidequest Decks\nThe prior Sidequest Decks are:\nAfter the TPK (Total Party Kill) - Ideas for the afterlife and how the party may return to the world.\nArcane Academy - Adventures centered on a magic school, for kid characters or adults.\nDungeons, Caverns, & Ruins Fantasy - Fantasy adventures in those settings.\nHigh Seas, Pirates, & Ports - Fantasy & pirate adventures on the seas or port cities.\nHorror Fantasy - Fantasy adventures with undead/necromancy themes.\nLovecraftian/Paranormal - Adventure outlines based on story seeds left behind by Lovecraft and other paranormal stories.\nModern (Criminals, Spies, & Supers) - Quests that take place in the modern day with mafia, spy, and super-hero themes.\nPolitical & Urban Fantasy - Fantasy adventures in town and cities as well as political plots.\nScience Fantasy - Adventures inspired by Jack Vance's Dying Earth, Thundarr the Barbarian, etc.\nScience Fiction - Adventures set in the far future.\nWilderness & Frontier Fantasy - Fantasy adventures set in the wilderness or villages.\nAnd as mentioned above the two Town Sidequest decks are related to our prior NPC Sidequest Decks Kickstarter, but they aren't essential if you plan to fit them into your own towns and NPCs.  If you wish to get the NPC Decks as part of this Kickstarter, they are available as add-ons. For that Kickstarter, we made the following NPC Decks:\nAdventurers\nAnimals (Companions, Familiars, etc.)\nCoastal Townsfolk\nFrontier Townsfolk\nHenchmen & Hirelings\nYou can pick any of the above NPC decks as add-ons, but only the Coastal & Frontier Townsfolk are related to the new Sidequest Decks. \nAnd if you don't want to wait to get our prior decks, the Sidequest Decks and the NPC Decks are all available in our store now.\nPledging\nWhile we've set up rewards for one deck (or PDF), four decks, 10 decks, and 15 decks, you can pick any number of decks by adding more via add-ons.  For example, if you want 6 decks, pledge for four, then as you make your pledge you'll be asked if you want any add-ons.  Pick two more.  You'll also be able to add more via the pledge manager later but pledging during the Kickstarter helps us hit our goal & stretch goals. You'll pick which specific decks you want via the pledge manager.\nShipping\nWe're working with a company that has fulfillment centers located in the US, Canada, the EU, and Australia to minimize shipping fees for most backers.\nWe'll charge for shipping through the Pledge Manager which allows us to have more detail on the shipping rates.  After some recent kerfuffles with international shipping, we've decided to partner with another company to do fulfillment in order to make sure we have friendly shipping rates for the EU, UK, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and of course the USA.  While we'll ship elsewhere, postage rates to other locations may be high. Here are our ballpark shipping rates, which do include VAT (money amounts in US dollars) where applicable:\nUSA: Flat $6 (any number of decks)\nUK: 1 deck $13, 4 decks $17, 10 decks: $29, 15 decks: $35\nEU: 1 deck $16, 4 decks $22, 10 decks: $34, 15 decks: $40\nCanada: 1 deck $16, 4 decks $19, 10 decks: $30, 15 decks: $35\nAustralia: Flat $20, due to their low VAT and shipping.\nNew Zealand: 1 deck $25, 4 decks $30, 10 decks: $40, 15 decks: $50\nOf course, if rates go up, VAT changes, etc., we'll have to pass that on.\nCollaborators\nWe're blessed to work with a great team of innovative RPG creators:\nAaron Canton: Aaron is a professional writer who specializes in writing fantasy and science-fiction works, and has created content for a variety of literary universes,  role-playing games, and works of interactive fiction. \nKeith Curtis: Keith has done about half of the Cartography on our prior Sidequest Decks.  He has also done work for many other game companies, including work on the Babylon 5 d20 RPG, the Song of Ice & Fire RPG, and the updated 5e Keep on the Borderlands.\nMisha Handman: Misha is a professional novelist and gaming writer who lives in the  Pacific Northwest. He has contributed to several earlier Sidequest decks, as well as work for White Wolf Publications and UFO Press. He is  proud to be the only person with his name on the Internet.\nJosh Parry: Josh is a freelance TTRPG author who has worked with Nord Games and LoreSmyth as well as his own self-published titles on Itch.io and the DMs Guild. \nAndrew Shields: Andrew has worked on our NPC Decks and our system neutral creature cards.  He has his own publishing imprint called Fictive Fantasies and has worked for a number of other RPG publishers.\nJoe Wetzel: Owner of Inkwell Ideas, Joe will manage the project, write some of the adventures, make some of the maps, and pick up anything else that needs doing.\nAnd we're helped by Backer Kit:", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis will be our 18th Kickstarter in 10 full years!

Note that the Ant-Man and Wasp Stretch Goals can only be found in the standard retail Core Box.\nWe will be offering backers the option to choose 2-Wave Expedited Shipping for their pledges! By selecting this option, we will separate your pledge into two shipping Waves. The First Wave will contain only the Marvel United: X-Men Core Box (however many copies you get) and it is estimated to deliver around September 2021, about the same time as the Core Box goes to retail. Then, the Second Wave will contain everything else in your pledge, including the box of Stretch Goals and all Optional Buys, and it is estimated to deliver around May 2022. Of course, by separating the shipping, the total cost of 2 different shipments will be charged, so by selecting this option you should notice an increase in your shipping cost and VAT if applicable. The finals costs will be calculated on the Pledg.it Pledge Manager system, however estimates for both waves are listed under 'Shipping Information'. Backers who select Single Wave Shipping will get their full pledge in the estimated May 2022 delivery date.\nPlease take note that once the system launches they'll also have different deadlines to confirm the pledges, with the Expedited shipment having a much earlier deadline. After the deadline to confirm the Expedited shipment pledges, all pledges (and extra pledges) containing the First Wave Core Box will be locked and will no longer be editable. However, everything related to the Second Wave will be editable up until the Second Wave deadline. This means that backers that confirm a 2-Wave Expedited Shipping order will still be able to add/remove pledges/add-ons related to the Second Wave after the First Wave deadline.\nNote: 2-Wave Expedited Shipping will not be available to backers in the UK.\nBased on past experience, we will be charging shipping after the Kickstarter concludes, based on the actual costs incurred to ship. We will collect this via our Pledg.it pledge manager after the campaign ends, using PayPal or Stripe. This is so we can be fair to all our backers as shipping is rarely one size fits all, and also give you more promo goodies and possibly a choice of carrier options.\nDepending on where in the world you are, we will either ship to you from our hub in the EU (European backers), UK (UK backers), Asia (Asian backers), Canada (Canadian backers), Australia (Australia and New Zealand backers) or Atlanta (USA and the rest of the world). Following is a list of rough estimates for shipping a basic Mutant pledge, for a 1 or 2-wave shipment. Keep in mind these are just estimates and that accurate costs will be calculated in the pledge manager system according to your address and that costs will likely rise based on optional buys you choose.\n>>> Note that, in compliance to the EU and UK laws, VAT will also be charged on the pledge manager system for EU and UK backers. At this time we cannot estimate the cost as the charges vary from country to country and it is based on the price of the order plus the actual shipping costs (which can only be properly determined in the system). However, rest assured that the full VAT to be charged on each pledge will be clearly displayed in the pledge manager system before final confirmation. European countries that are not part of the European Union or UK will not be charged VAT.\n**Latin America, Africa, and ROW estimates are based on USPS rates. If USPS is not available, these rates may change. \nBe aware that any pledges that are confirmed after the pledge manager deadline is considered a \"Late Confirm\" and will be shipped from the Asia Hub at a later date, likely incurring increased shipping costs and possible customs fees. Also, note that Late Confirms will not be able to customize the contents of their pledge. They will be offered a single pledge, including most, if not all, the content offered on Kickstarter. We also cannot ship to PO Boxes domestically or internationally. Due to the size of each package there is too great a risk of the package being bounced back to us.\nThe table below gives you a general idea of the full schedule of what to expect once the campaign ends. Keep in mind these are just estimates, and the timeline may vary due to circumstances.\n To learn about Retail Pledges click HERE.\n                                                          \u00a9 2021 MARVEL", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our 48th Kickstarter, and there are some vagaries in terms of timing when it comes to anything produced in China, such as:\nProduction delays\nShipping delays\nCustoms delays\n\nThe estimated delivery date for this project is May 2022, for single wave pledges, and for Expedited Shipment pledges, September 2021 and May 2022 for wave 1 and 2 respectively, but keep in mind this is only an estimate. Also, due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others. We've done our best to minimize this as much as possible, and we are always happy to refund pledges if for some totally unforeseen reason the game can't be delivered at all.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nWe can refund you within 14 days of the campaign\u2019s end, fees included. After that, we have a policy of no questions asked, though that\u2019s minus Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we can\u2019t get back from them after 14 days). However, if we\u2019ve begun packaging your pledge for shipment, no refunds are possible. If a component cannot be delivered AT ALL, we refund that completely, including fees.\nAll refunds after the 14 days close of the campaign may be processed via PayPal or reversed via Stripe to your credit card at our discretion. Refunds within 14 days are reversed via Stripe to your credit card.\nThis project is being funded in USD and any refunds processed will be in USD for the exact amount received in USD, excluding any applicable fees depending on the time of the refund being processed.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look, materials and content of the rewards (and the project) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented while the Kickstarter project was active.\n\nIf you do not log in to the Pledge Manager and confirm your pledge in that system within 8 weeks of our notification via email to confirm your pledge, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received. However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your pledge if you contact us and confirm your pledge after the 8 week window has elapsed. Unconfirmed pledges make it difficult for us to plan production and logistics, and in the past have led to project delays. For this project we do not intend to allow this to happen, which may mean if you confirm your pledge too late, exclusive items may not be produced in sufficient quantity for your pledge.\n\nIf you confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods. We regret we are unable to ship to PO Boxes.\n\nAll backers that have selected \u201cNo Reward\u201d on Kickstarter, that wish to receive a reward for this campaign, must make sure to confirm their order by the Pledge Manager Deadline. We will announce the date for this once the Pledge Manager becomes live. All \u201cNo Reward\u201d pledges will be treated as donations once the Pledge Manager Deadline has passed.\n\nIf you do not accept these terms please do not pledge on this project, but instead wait for the retail release.\n\nTo make sure you have the best gaming experience, all CMON products are warrantied against manufacturing defects for 2 years from the of date purchase from CMON (proof of purchase required).

Each turn, players can: \n Collect resources by drawing from the Supply Bag or visiting the Market, \n Build stages of their unique wonder, \nor complete Support structures. \nIn games of 4+ Players,  players may also Trade, negotiating freely with other players to add to the fun as more players compete.\nPowerful Leaders can also step in to provide game-changing effects. \nBut be careful! Building can be treacherous. Support structures can speed up the construction of your wonder, but also require time and resources which are taken away from completing your wonder. The choices are yours!\nLizzie at Long Distance Gamers provided a wonderful Unboxing Video to give you an idea of how the components look (Prototype Copy).\nOne Card Wonder is a fast, simple, and strategic game that packs in some tough decisions about when and what to build as you seek to impress the world with your Wonder!\nCollecting resources is key! But how best to do it?\nYou can Produce resources by drawing randomly from the supply bag. Keep two resources you may need and place the rest into the Market.\nVisit the Market to take all of the resources of one type from the supply.\nOr, in games of 4+ players, you can get the resources you need by trading with others, if they'll consider your negotiations, that is. How persuasive can you be?\nOne Card Wonder is highly repayable! \nEach of the 12 player mats in the game has a unique set of Support buildings. \nBuild a Support building to make completing your Wonder easier and mark your special ability using one of four obelisk player pieces. \nWill the time and resources spent building a Support be worth the time away from completing your wonder or will your fellow builders race ahead?\nOf course, the multiple stages of your Wonder must be built from the ground up, while the Support buildings may be built in any order. Complete all stages of your wonder to win the game and become the envy of the ancient world!\n\nDon't forget about your unique Leader! Leaders provide a major one-time influence on the game that can be strategically deployed to create a beneficial in-game effect. Plan wisely!\nDownload the near-final One Card Wonder rulebook to check it out yourself.\n\nNot convinced? You can play One Card Wonder online with your friends using Tabletopia to feel the intense game play in this fast-paced game that is easy to get to the table.\nOr sit back and watch Matthew and Jon from Friday Knight Games play on Tabletopia with designer Nat Levan.\nThanks to 1 Minute Board Games for her quick tutorial on game play.\nClearly, we love this wondrous game!

But they have trouble printing common interlocking building blocks. PrintABlok was my answer to this problem, creating a building block for 3D printers that would just work.\nAnd PrintABlok is remarkable because it can't be mass produced. it can only be made with 3D printing.

Full of zany, whimsical graphics, it's a perfect companion for people of any age building out their self-care toolkit.\nLoosely inspired by tarot, each number covers a category of self-care activities  - like meditation or boundaries. Each suit is an area of life - such as emotion or passion. You can shuffle the deck to pick one thing to do at random, play out a suit to experience many self-care activities in one area of life, or explore a category of self-care by playing out the four cards in one number. As you play, you'll learn a lot of self-care strategies - and gain an understanding of what works for you when.\nEasy to carry, easy to transport, and easy to use. The options are endless whether alone or with a group of friends.\nDuring the pandemic, we saw friends and loved ones begin to really struggle with their mental health, and they didn't have the resources to take care of themselves. We wanted to make something fun and accessible to help everyone invest in their wellness.\nPLAY\n\nThis deck became a labor of love for both of us - a celebration of our long self-care journeys. We've spent a lot of time in self-help book sections, in therapy, and in group programming. We know that there is no Ted Talk one-size-fits-all solution to wellness, and that self-care requires a broad toolkit of skills. In building out the deck, we tried to bring in a broad range of skills - and consulted with experts to keep the activities evidence-backed.\nWe couldn't be prouder of the result. Full of personal, strange illustrations, we believe each card distills down a core self-care skill to its basics, and that the deck as a whole offers a solid foundation for anyone hoping to invest in their wellness.\nThe Deck of Care is for anyone who is looking for ways to invest in their wellness, or who is trying to find a balance in this hard world. Filled with fun graphics meant to keep self-care light-hearted, this deck is your perfect companion as you experiment in finding what works best for you when it comes to well-being.\nThe deck also makes a great gift for friends and loved ones entering difficult new adventures - like going to college, attending graduate school, starting a new job, or beginning a family. It serves as a physical reminder to always invest in wellness - even when it seems impossible. We've even designed the deck to be child-friendly, so it can be a lifelong aid for a young one in your life who is just starting to build their self-care toolkit.\n\nAlso inspired by tarot, each of the suits represent an area of your life and is represented by an animal that we felt captured its spirit.\nIf a player wants to go on a longer journey of self-care exploration, we recommend working through a whole suit from Ace to King over the course of a month.\n\nEvery card has a custom illustration that matches the self-care activity. From an 80\u2019s muscle head owl to a snorkeling narwhal, they\u2019re meant to be light-hearted, slightly absurd, and comedic relief for you as you navigate the new ritual of being good to yourself. Our hope? That the unique visuals bring a smile to your face.\n\n\nWe\u2019re prioritizing functionality and beauty over cost efficiency on our production. We are printing on casino-grade German Blue Core paper with a smooth linen-finish. The cardboard tuckbox is printed on colored cardboard and will print with embossing.\n\n$50,000 - We will create a set of training videos to accompany the deck\n\nIf we hit our first stretch goal, we will announce a second. We are reviewing special touches we could apply to printing and limited editions.\n\n\nExhausted Millennial is a creative collaborative between two old friends - Devin and Christin. We met at Drexel University when we were Resident Assistants together, and continued a best-trash-human friendship into our 30s.\n\nIn the summer of 2020, we started a letter-writing project in which we wrote one card a day to a loved one. We worked together to make a set of greeting cards for the project and enjoyed it so much that we just kept making things together. Our brand aims to make things that make existing in this tough world a bit easier - while not taking ourselves too seriously. More than that, we hope to have fun every step of the way.\n\nThose initial cards are available for free for personal use on our site.\nWe are hoping to use the funding from this Kickstarter to launch an e-commerce store with our designs.  We have a long list of projects we want to work on next, and hope this is just the start of a long journey for our little venture.\n\nYou can find out more about Exhausted Millennial on our website or social media, and get a preview of all 54 cards as we roll them out over the next two months:\nFacebook \nInstagram \nPinterest \nTwitter \nOur Site", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our first Kickstarter, so we anticipate we may hit hiccups and have tried to compensate for that with extra work on the front end. We have done extensive research to source a few high quality manufacturers and to print samples. This has allowed us to test functionality and print quality of the cards. We just need to know what the demand looks like and help to fund the mass production. We are confident in the quality of our design and production choices - but, as can happen in any supply chain, something could go wrong during production that delays our timeline.\n\nWe anticipate that our greatest hurdle will be shipping out the decks, especially if sell a very large volume. We are actively researching logistic centers to explore our fulfillment options, and will begin contracting the relationship once we have a concrete idea of our print volume. Establishing that relationship may cause delays in shipping.\n\nTracked shipping will be available by default for domestic (US) purchases, but may not be available in all international markets.

Her promising young assistant Miriam Mayne has accidentally transferred her consciousness to Saturn, where she falls under the enchantment of an evil sorcerer! Jack Paladin, her love, sets out after her on a thrilling celestial journey to the ringed planet! Swashbuckling adventure and high romance await in Julian Hawthorne\u2019s The Cosmic Courtship!\nA Lost Pulp Adventure Restored!\nWhile most are at least somewhat familiar with Nathaniel Hawthorne as one of the great American authors, less well known is that his son,  Julian Hawthorne, was an incredibly prolific writer in his own right. Julian wrote on a wide variety of subjects, ranging from literary analysis of his father's works to poetry to period romances and adventures. Late in his career, Julian even dabbled in the emerging genre of Science Fiction [Hugo Gernsback had only recently coined the awkward term \"Scientifiction\" when this story was first published.]\nThe Cosmic Courtship was serialized in Frank A. Munsey's All-Story Weekly across four issues, beginning with the November 24, 1917 issue and running through the December 15, 1917 issue. While this story has been in the public domain for some time, it has never been collected or published elsewhere until now.\nCirsova Publishing has partnered with Michael Tierney and Robert Allen Lupton to preserve this story for posterity and ensure that it is not lost to future generations.\nThe Cosmic Courtship was serialized across four issues of All-Story Weekly\n\nGoals of this Project\nThe foremost goal of this project is to get an exciting, essentially lost, classic pulp story back into print and into the hands of scifi fans, pulp aficionados, and readers in general!\nWhat do we mean by \"essentially lost\"? While The Cosmic Courtship is a work in the Public Domain and part of the world's common literary heritage, there's virtually no way for anyone to read it! It has only ever been printed in now very expensive and hard to find pulp magazines. Even if cost were not an object, availability often is. \nThis is the case for many novels and novellas from the early pulp era. Julian Hawthorne's The Cosmic Courtship is only one example.\nThe main issues with a project like this are the investment of time and the risk to (often nigh-irreplaceable) physical materials required to reproduce the texts.\nIt is important that the team be compensated for their time and work that they put into making these texts available. \nPhysical Reproductions of the Work\nThe initial goal for this project is to bring The Cosmic Courtship back into print. People who want to read this work will be able to read this novel without having to invest hundreds of dollars into 100+ year old pulp magazines as they infrequently appear on the open collector market. \nAll backers will be credited in an appendix for helping bring this to fruition.\nWe are offering both paperback and hardback formats, as well as a novelty magazine format [similar to Cirsova Magazine] and a no-frills pocket paperback edition. \nWant to spread the love? Be a super backer and donate a classroom set to your favorite teacher or librarian! Help get this work into people's hands!\nThe Cosmic Courtship cover artwork by Fred W. Small, digitally restored by Michael Tierney.\n$3,000 - Bonus Materials\nNot only will we be including the original text of Julian Hawthorne's The Cosmic Courtship, we will including some additional biographical materials and other works by Julian Hawthorne, including a facsimile version of \"Scenes of Hawthorne's Romances,\" an essay on his father's writings, featuring the text as it was originally presented with numerous illustrated plates. \n$8,000 - Digital Copies + Donation of a Public Domain Copy\nAs mentioned, there is a lot of labor, risk, and costs involved in salvaging these texts--we want to ensure that the team working on this project are compensated: if it is worth everyone's while, this will be the first of many.\nThe ultimate goal of a project like this is to make these available to the world because they are part of our literary heritage and everyone should be able to discover and analyze these works to better understand the patchwork history of this fascinating era of fiction.\nIf we raise $8,000, not only will we provide all backers with digital copies of the volume we are creating, we will create and donate a digital text version of the original story to Project Gutenberg. \nThese will be made available after backers have been sent their physical copies.\nPlease consider donating to sponsor this project, or order multiple copies, so we can reach this goal!\n$10,000 - Ongoing Imprint\nMichael Tierney has an impressive pulp library, filled with innumerable stories that are public domain but have never been in print since the early 20th Century. If we raise $10,000, that will show us that there is sufficient interest and support to turn this into an ongoing project where we work with pulp archivists to \"rescue\" these nearly lost works and make them available both in print and for the general public domain so that they can be preserved and enjoyed by future generations!\n$15,000 - Original Images Available\nMichael has agreed to release the images we used of the four issues of All-Story to compile this edition. Michael will host these these images, nearly 100 pages of pulp, on his website.\n$20,000 - ?????\nWhat will we do for $20,000? I don't know yet, but we'll have to think of something fast, since it looks like it's in the realm of possibility!\nAbout the Team\nMichael Tierney is a pulp historian and archivist who has written extensively on Edgar Rice Burroughs, having created the massive four volume Edgar Rice Burroughs 100 Year Art Chronology, and is currently working on another Art Chronology about Robert E. Howard. He has been involved in the comic book industry for 40 years, owning two of the oldest comic book stores in Central Arkansas until switching to mail-order only in 2020. He is also an accomplished science fiction writer and artist, having worked on his Wild Stars saga since the 1970s. Michael not only made his pulp library available for this project, he provided the photographic images of these rare magazines so that a manuscript could be produced. He has also lent his years of experience digitally restoring damaged pulp art to restore the original cover by  Fred W. Small to create a unique cover for this edition.\nRobert Allen Lupton is a prolific author, pulp historian, and commercial hot air balloon pilot. He has published nearly 200 short stories across numerous anthologies, including the New York Times Best Selling Chicken Soup For the Soul series, and has published several anthologies and novels. His most recent novel, \"Dejanna of the Double Star\" was published in December 2020. Robert has been an active Edgar Rice Burroughs historian, researcher, and writer since the 1970s, including at ERBzine, where several of his articles and stories are published. Robert has painstakingly recreated the text as it was originally published from the digital images provided from Michael's collection.\nCirsova Publishing has been publishing thrilling adventure science fiction and fantasy since 2016. They have published nearly 20 issues of their flagship publication, Cirsova Magazine. Additionally, they have published a number of anthologies, a fully illustrated edition of Leigh Brackett's Planet Stories-era Stark adventures, Jim Breyfogle's Mongoose and Meerkat, and the 35th Anniversary Editions of Michael Tierney's Wild Stars.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nMost of the work on this project is done. We're in the process of cleaning up the text, checking it against the scans to ensure that it accurately reflects Hawthorne's story as it was published [while we have corrected a few obvious typos in the original text, we have retained everything else as is to preserve the nuances of Hawthorne's writing].\n\nThe largest task will be fulfillment.

Developed in close association with Adams\u2019s family and literary estate, 42 will be a full-colour, large-format hardback that follows his career from early collaborations with Graham Chapman to his work on Doctor Who, through the Hitchhiker years, Dirk Gently, his groundbreaking non-fiction book Last Chance to See and his later digital work. Alongside this are details of projects that never came to fruition like a proposed theme park ride and a TV series provisionally entitled The Secret Empire. \nAll backers (except for those at the digital poster level) will get their name printed in a special list of supporters at the back of the book.\nJUST IMAGINE\n'I think Douglas was something that we don\u2019t have a word for yet \u2013 a futurologist or an explainer. One day we will realise that the most important job out there is someone that can explain the world to itself in ways the world won\u2019t forget.' Neil Gaiman\nAs Adams's fans know, he was as much a thinker as he was a writer and one of the reasons for creating this book is to properly explore this aspect of his life. The combination of his deep fascination with technology and his unique imagination meant that he had an uncanny knack for predicting the future direction of the digital world. As far back as 1995, he suggested that computers needed to stop being giant hulks of metal and disappear into the things around us to make them smarter. He also had an extraordinary ability to tackle complicated ideas and explain them in entertaining and memorable ways.\nThe following is from one of the speeches he gave later in his life. Bear in mind that when he wrote this, the iPhone, the Kindle, Twitter, Facebook and many other things we take for granted didn't exist.\n'Imagine if every piece of information we ever generated about the world that passed through a computer, whether it's... \na restaurant typing up its menu for the evening, whether it's \na shop maintaining its stock list,  whether it's\n a car noticing what speed it's going, how much petrol it's got left and where the nearest service stations are, and what prices they are charging, whether it's \nsomeone measuring the wingspan of an African swallow, whether it's \nsomeone writing down where and when their grandmother was born, whether it's someone taking a digital photo from the top of the Great Pyramid, \nor just of a flower that has bloomed early this year, \nOr late, or the settings on your thermostat when it's turned on or off,\nOr if every time you took your child's temperature the network remembered.\nImagine all of that gradually creating a shared software model of the world. Just imagine.'\nLetters to Douglas\nThe book will be published in 2022, the year that Adams would have turned 70 years old. A number of his friends and fans are contributing letters to Douglas written for this occasion that will appear in the book. They include Sanjeev Bhaskar, Gary Brooker, Margo Buchanan, Prof Brian Cox and Robin Ince (the Infinite Monkey Cage), Mark Carwardine, Arvind Ethan David, Sue Freestone, Stephen Fry, Neil Gaiman, Simon Jones, John Lloyd, Michael Nesmith, Dirk Maggs, Caitlin Moran and Robbie Stamp.\nThe Book\nThe book will be edited by Kevin Jon Davies, who first met Adams in 1978, knew him for 20 years, and has subsequently worked on a number of Hitchhiker-related projects. \nIt will be 320 pages long and A4 format (210mm by 297mm). For the standard hardback edition the cover will be printed directly onto the cover boards. The collector's edition features an additional wraparound French fold dust jacket printed on both sides that folds out into a poster.\n\nA Note from the Family: \n\"What Douglas loved more than a good idea was sharing a good idea, and whether it was the 1st or 100th time you had heard it, his obvious delight never diminished. It's a pleasure to share that delight with you in this book. We hope you enjoy it.\" \n\n The Rewards\nAbout Kevin Jon Davies . . .   \nKevin with Douglas in the Hitchhikers's studio 1980\nKevin Jon Davies grew up enthralled with Doctor Who and The Goon Show. The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide radio series in 1978 combined the best of both, so the young art student sought out its little-known author Douglas Adams, recording an early fanzine interview. Following a career in film and tv, he went on to direct The Making of Hitchhiker, the 1993 documentary for BBC Video. Adams then invited Davies to art-direct The Illustrated Hitchhiker, a large-format book with pioneering digital composites. Since then he has contributed to a number of Adams-related projects, including as researcher into Adams\u2019 archives for The Hexagonal Phase (2018); the final radio series of The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy.\n\nAbout Unbound:\nHi, we're Unbound, the crowdfunding publisher.\nWe bring writers and readers closer together.

And, well, it is. Especially since the Crystals that you seek happen to be inside giant space Beasts. To mine them, you need to, well, be eaten.\nShould you achieve your objective and mine enough Crystals to meet your quota, it is then cost-effective for the company to activate your jetpack and extricate you from the proverbial belly of the Beast.\nIn the event that the Bacteria present in the Beast overwhelm you and you are digested, do not despair. Your non-organic parts will certainly be useful in the mining exploits of future Miners. In fact, you may encounter some such pieces of equipment in your expedition, remains of less-than-qualified recruits from past attempts.\nFinally, it could transpire that you do not collect the necessary Crystals by the time you reach the end of your adventure, without the Beast having digested you.\nIn this case, you will then exit the Beast from the other end than the one you entered. Alive... and yet forever changed. In this case we will have to evaluate your performance against that of the Beast\u2019s efforts to consume you.\nIn So, You've Been Eaten. the Miner and the Beast will face off against one another. \nThe Miner earns points by collecting Crystals and the Beast earns points by developing Immune Responses and by its Bacteria attacking the Miner.\nThe game ends in a win for the Miner if they collect all 8 different Crystals, and the Beast wins by digesting the Miner after four Bacteria of the same type have attacked.\nOf course, there\u2019s always the possibility that the Miner will simply pass through the Beast\u2019s system, and then the player with the most points wins!\n So, You\u2019ve Been Eaten. can be played as:\nA game for 2 players, with a Miner player against a Beast player.\nA game for 1 player, with the Miner player against a Hibernating Beast.\nA game for 1 player, with the Beast player against a robot Miner.\nA game for 0 players, with a Hibernating Beast against a robot Miner.\n\nWant the all-in-fire-and-forget pledge?\nThe hyper-high-end one with triple-layered(!) boards?\nThe lovingly deluxified KS-limited objet d'art for your shelf?\nThe one with the bursting-with-bits-even-though-it's-even-bigger-box?\nChoose the Collector Edition pledge level, and rejoice!\nAnd if you have not yet decided to back now, here's why you should:\n- Discounted shipping! Post-campaign shipping costs will be higher.\n- Guaranteed availability of the Collector edition! Due to its bigger, special box, we will likely not be producing this as easily as the retail edition, and due to its heavier weight, this is not going to be easy to ship when not doing mass KS fulfillment.\n- Loyalty discount! Get $1 per previous LudiCreations campaign backed - see below for more details.\n- Don't miss a game full of unconventional asymmetric gameplay by Scott Almes & striking art by Kwanchai Moriya!\nPremium Edition - savings\nThe custom-shaped double-printed acrylic Crystal tokens and the printed wooden Bacteria tokens are going to be available as a $9 add-on, and the Dyspepto-Beastmol mini-expansion will be available as a $5 add-on. By backing the Premium edition, you would get a $4 discount, and also receive the custom-cut Replication token (the \"Miner meeple\"), which we do not expect to later sell separately.\n\nCollector Edition - LudiCreations Loyalty Discount\nBackers of the Collector Edition will receive a discount of $1 per previous LudiCreations campaign they have backed in the past, up to a maximum of $5 off. This will be applied in Backerkit and can be used for reducing the cost of shipping and add-ons. For more information, please see the FAQs.\n\nTuckboxes - Sleeves?\nYes, they fit. We tested with premium sleeves.\nRemember kids, always use protection!\nSo, You've Been Eaten. is an asymmetric game. Players must balance short-term benefit against trying to gain an advantage for the next turns. Many times they will need to simply survive the turn. To win, they need to make clever plays and try to corner their opponent into having to make increasingly difficult choices.\nThe Miner is playing a dice manipulation & placement game to try to eliminate Bacteria and capture Crystals (and Tools) that are present on a row of cards between them and the Beast player.\nThe Beast is playing a hand management and drafting game, to try to position their Bacteria to attack the Miner, and acquire Immune Response cards that can make the Miner player's life difficult.\nThe 2p game\nThe Miner begins, and rolls their dice. They then take an action with each one of those dice, removing Stomach cards from the digestive tract between the players, and at the end of their turn, whatever Bacteria is closest to them attacks!\nThe Beast then strategically refills the tract to cause the Miner the most difficulty, then may develop an Immune Response, refills their hand, and plays a Mutation card against the Miner, trying to match the Bacteria on it with the one that might attack the Miner at the end of their turn!\nIf the Miner collects 8 Crystals, they win outright. If one of the Beast's Bacteria tracks reaches the 4th level, the Beast wins immediately. If the deck of Stomach card runs out, points are counted, and whoever player has the most is the winner!\n\nThe 1p game\nSo, You've Been eaten. can be played as a solo game, either as the Miner (against a Hibernating Beast), or as the Beast (against a Robot Miner).\nAll actions remain the same. What changes is how their effects are triggered.\n\nThe 0p game\nNope, 0 players does not mean that the game will set up and play itself. And no, it probably does not count as a play if you decide to not play it. Yes, it does seem to fit the times we are now living in.\nHowever you look at it, having the two AIs play each other is possible, and a conversation starter for the non-board-game-geeks wandering near your shelf.\nYou can download the rules of So, You've Been Eaten. here.\nYou can download the rules of So, You've Been Eaten.: Dyspepto-Beastmol here.\nPlease download these files, as PDFs viewed in-browser may not be displayed properly.

The final produced game may vary in minor ways, e.g. in the tint of some colors, the dimensions of some components, etc.\n\n Featuring:\nSpecial Guest Star:\nWe expect to fulfill the rewards bound for the USA from within the USA, the ones for the EU, from Germany, the ones for the UK from the UK, and the ones for Canada from Canada.\nBackers in the EU, UK, USA and Canada do not have to worry about customs or VAT.\nRewards going to Asia/Pacific/South Africa/Middle East will be fulfilled by VFI Asia.\nNote that we can not be responsible for any re-shipping fees in case your package is returned as unclaimed, or if the address you provided is not valid. Should a package not arrive within a certain time frame that will be announced when it has been shipped, we will spend a period of time investigating its fate before any action is taken.\nCertain countries do not appear on the list of available shipping destinations. This is due to past experiences and potential cost overruns due to weight fluctuations. Click the pledge level and please contact us via KS message if your country does not appear on the list. Regrettably, shipping to CIS and Brazil will not be possible. \n We will be using Backerkit as our post-campaign fulfillment suite and pre-order management platform, through which shipping costs may be paid and additional copies may be obtained.\nBackerkit carts will be locked and credit cards will be charged shortly before fulfillment commences. There will be backer updates that inform about all deadlines.\n\nCosts\nThe real cost of shipping is subsidized and is offered for backers who pledge during the campaign being live. Post-campaign pre-order will likely be paying higher fees.\nShipping fees include costs like ocean freight, import fees and/or VAT, packing materials, labor, replacements shipping; and the risk of shipping cost increases. Those can add anything from $3 to $10 to the price you would have to pay if we did not subsidize them.\nThe shipping costs per copy are as follows, and include tracking:\nBasic edition: USA - $9 / EU - $9 / Everywhere else - $14\nPremium edition: USA - $9 / EU - $9 / Everywhere else - $14\nCollector edition: USA - $9 / EU - $14 / Everywhere else - $19\nUnfortunately backers in the UK, Switzerland, Norway and Canada do not fall in the EU and USA cost categories.\nThe USA cost category includes the \"lower 48\" states, and does not include Alaska, Hawaii, Guam & Puerto Rico. For these and for any other outlying territories, the \"everywhere else\" category applies. Please ask if in doubt.\nBackers (even $1 backers completing their pledge in Backerkit) will get the game with the discounted shipping costs outlined here. The cost will likely increase for post-campaign pre-orders. \nThe real costs that we have to pay are at least $12 for the USA, and $15 in the EU and worldwide - and that is not counting ocean freight and customs costs for us.\nIMPORTANT: Do not add these costs to your pledge! We will collect the shipping cost after the campaign, via Backerkit.\nRegrettably, we can not offer pickup at Spiel in Essen or any other convention.\n\nCOVID-19 Impact\nFulfillment providers worldwide are reporting that significant disruptions in deliveries persist in parts of the world. In practical terms this means that shipments to individual countries may be subject to delays.\nWe have taken what we now (March 2021) know into account when determining our production, logistics and fulfillment plans. However, it may happen that we may deviate from the schedule, and as noted in the Risks section, other backers may receive their rewards a lot earlier than you.\nWhen we have specific new information, we will reach out to backers, either via a backer update or individually, as the situation develops. In any case, please be prepared for delays, both in freight (before your reward is shipped), and after individual fulfillment has commenced. \n Retailers who wish to back this campaign must back at the $1 pledge level, and then contact us via the KS messaging system: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ludicreations/so-youve-been-eaten/messages/new?message%5Bto%5D=ludicreations\nThis offer is available to retailers who have a physical store in the countries allowed by the $1 pledge level. All entities and locations will be verified.\nRetailers within North America may also order from our distribution service provider Hit Point Sales, if signed up with an account. This would likely result in lower shipping costs (e.g. if ordering other games at the same time).\nOnline-only retailers will be considered in territories where no physical retailers have backed the campaign.\n\nFulfillment will be conducted in the following steps:\n1. Individual backers\n2. Physical stores\n3. Online-only stores (if any) - at least 2 weeks after the previous step\n\nThere will be a limit on how many copies of each edition that a retailer can order. A deposit will be taken during the campaign, with the rest of the funds payable via Backerkit.\nOnly retailers who back this campaign will be able to re-order any editions normally available only on Kickstarter, subject to availability.\n\nPlease contact us for more information.\nWhat You See Is What You Get - we like to run simple, straightforward campaigns. We are aware that stretch goals would increase the funding total. However, we have already thrown everything into this game - a lot of time, effort, and money. We are already going to print with the highest quality materials.\nWe also want to offer the game at the cheapest cost possible - and that is incompatible with stretch goals. We'd have to add \"hidden\" profit in the pledge levels that we can then \"spend\" to give you stretch goals - nothing is for free. Raising money beyond our goal does not give us extra money on hand to create stretch goals.\nRetail availability: The game will be available through retailers that back the campaign and want the Collector edition. We hope to eventually send a version of the game to distribution.\nGame design: Scott Almes\nIllustration: Kwanchai Moriya\nGraphic design: Viktor Csete\nProject management: Dimitris \"JamesH\" Chatzidimitriou\nRulebook editing: Paul \"GamingRules\" Grogan\nSpecial thanks: Alvin Chen, David Turczi, Philipp K\u00fchnl, Paulo Renato, Sonja Hatanp\u00e4\u00e4, Toni Heinonen, Angela Viveen, Adam Singer, David \"Dam\" Amorin Garc\u00eda, and all those brave space miners who helped us develop this completely fictional game that is definitely not from a dystopian future.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAll previous campaigns have been fulfilled, except \"Mr. Cabbagehead's Garden returns!\". Its production is initiated, and the project is on track to be completed on time. We are working with a manufacturer we have worked with before, and we are confident in our ability to deliver the game and any additional materials. That said, unforeseen events may affect how quickly fulfillment is conducted, and the final colors, graphics and components that you see presented here are subject to (however improbable) change. We are working with retailers and due to that and the realities of international logistics, it is very likely that some backers or other people may have the game in hand before you do. Note that our goal is to ship the game on time, by the dates listed on the pledge levels. Shipping a package is different than delivering a package. We do not deliver your game, the shipping company does.

Clash of Deck is a card game which has been played and tested by hundreds of players throughout its first year of existence, as a French version. The game was published in 2020 in an atypical form: cards you cut yourself from a folded sheet of cardboard. A new standalone expansion was published each month. \nToday, thanks to the feedback and support of its community of players, Clash of Deck takes off with a new edition, available in English. The game will have more conventional components, such as \"real\" cards, larger and of better quality, with a tuck box. \nThe game will be fully translated in English and French!

We recommend the Draft format for your first plays. Each turn, the players draft cards from a common deck to build themselves an efficient deck. For the Draft format, you only need one copy of the Starter Kit. The Constructed format is destined for experts who've mastered the game's mechanisms and the synergies brought by special abilities. Players build their own decks by choosing 10 cards among all the cards from the game. Their opponent will banish two of those cards at the beginning of the game, to form the final 8-cards deck. For the Constructed format, each player must have a copy of the Starter Kit.\nEach player receives a \u201cWatchtower/Stronghold\u201d card. \nPlace the 2 \u201cBridge\u201d cards in the play area. \nShuffle all the other cards into a draw pile. \nThen, reveal the top 4 cards of the draw pile. First, player A chooses 1 of the 4 available cards. Then, player B chooses 2 of the 3 remaining cards. Finally, player A takes the last remaining card. Repeat the operation, but this time, player B chooses the first card. Repeat until each player has 8 cards. Each player shuffles their cards, constituting their hand. They then place their \u201cWatchtower\u201d card in the leftmost place in their hand.\nThe player who crossed a bridge last becomes the first player. For their first turn, they begin the game with only 6 Mana.\nPlayers play their turn one after another. A turn consists of 3 phases:\nPhase 1 \u2013 Mana Regeneration:\nThe player gains as much Mana as the number of cards in their hand (including the \u201cWatchtower/Stronghold\u201d card). Mana is used to pay cards costs. The player can use it during phase 2.\nPhase 2 \u2013 Summoning:\nThe player can spend the Mana gained during phase 1 to play cards from their hand. A player can only play the 4 leftmost cards in their hand (ignoring the \u201cWatchtower / Stronghold\u201d card). \nA card\u2019s Mana cost is indicated in their upper left corner. Mana that isn\u2019t spent during a turn is lost. A player cannot spend more Mana than they gained during their previous phase 1. The play area consists of two lanes. When playing a card, the player chooses in which lane to place it. \nPlayers only summon units in their respective Realm: player A places their card on the left of the \u201cBridge\u201d cards and player B places their cards on the right of the \u201cBridge\u201d cards. There is no limit to the number of cards in a lane. A summoned unit is placed from the player\u2019s hand in the play area, face up, in the lane of their choice, behind their other units already in play. The card remains in play as long as it isn\u2019t destroyed.\nPhase 3 \u2013 Assault:\nA unit has Health Points (HP), and an Attack Value (ATK). A unit cannot attack the turn it enters play. Each unit a player controls inflicts their ATK value to an opposing unit. Units automatically activate in a predetermined order: first the upper lane, from the unit further away from to the unit closest to the \u201cBridge\u201d; then, the lower lane, from the unit further away from to the unit closest to the \u201cBridge\u201d. \nWhen a unit suffers at least as much damage as its HP value, the unit is destroyed. It suffers the entirety of the damage caused by the attack and the card returns to its owner\u2019s hand, in the rightmost place.\nThen, move all the units on the lane closer to the \u201cBridge\u201d so they fill the gap. Units regenerate their HP at the end of the turn. During an assault, a unit inflicts its ATK value to the closest opposing unit on the same lane. If no opposing unit can be attacked, the unit then inflicts its damage directly to the opponent\u2019s \u201cWatchtower/Stronghold\u201d.\nWhen a \u201cWatchtower/Stronghold\u201d suffers damage, shift it that many places to the right in the player\u2019s hand. \nWhen a \u201cWatchtower\u201d reaches the rightmost place in a player hand, it is destroyed: flip it to its \u201cStronghold\u201d side and return it to the leftmost place in the player\u2019s hand. Excess damage inflicted to the \u201cWatchtower\u201d does not carry over to the \u201cStronghold\u201d. When a \u201cStronghold\u201d card reaches the rightmost place in a player\u2019s hand, that player loses the game.\nEnd of the game\nThe game ends as soon as a \u201cStronghold\u201d card reaches the rightmost place in a player\u2019s hand. Their opponent then wins the game.\nThe Solo Mode allows you to play Clash of Deck alone, through a Quick play or a Custom play.  Before playing custom games, we recommend you practice with a few Quick games to learn and discover the rules and the peculiarities of Clash of Deck\u2019s solo mode.

It is the world's first one-piece miniature electric hand drill for creative DIY, and it features super lightweight, ultra-quietness and great portability.\nFinish your DIY projects with the right tool kit is important. WOWSTICK hand drill helps drill small holes of various things: resin, plastic, wood cardboard, paper cardboard, crafts, model making, aluminum / copper sheet and foil, etc. Aiming at its practicality and simplicity, WOWSTICK is the cordless lithium-ion battery powered drill which is crated just like a pen, an ideal tool for DIY-ers as well as general people.\nNo more clunky gadgets, wires, and plug-points. WOWSTICK one-piece miniature hand drill with its dispatchable head lets you accomplish your creation by gripping up, aiming at the point, and pressing one single button.  \nThe WOWSTICK drill is small and light, just 1.6oz (46g) which fits right in your hand and literally easy to carry anywhere, so you can take it to distant workplaces. Sized at 6.8\u201d*0.6\u201d (172*13.8mm), you can grip it like a pen for ultimate control and precision as well as for comfort.\nIt is not only a great tool for DIY projects, but also a hassle-free decoration to put in your pocket or on any desktop.\nEvery bit of WOWSTICK from outside to inside (Except the button and the charging port) is all metal CNC machined to ensure the seamless curves and consistent product quality. Greatly standing out from the conventional drills in the market, this manner is more precisely made to achieve more stable product performance. Our drilling spindle run-out is far exceeding the industry standard to be less than 0.1mm, resulting in high-precision drilling at the right position every time.\nThe WOWSTICK kit has 8 drill bits made of harden steel: 0.8mm, 1.0mm, 1.2mm, 1.4mm, 1.6mm, 1.8mm, 2.0mm, 2.2mm and it allows drilling at 420r/min \u00b1 10%, so you can use it in many projects and get accurate results.\nThe handheld device is practically designed to cater for different needs, letting you plug in and off bits based on your projects, and the fact that the bits are fully compatible with 2.35 mm diameter bits accessible in the market, you may drill, decorate and attach your crafts freely.\nThe bits can be used on a variety of materials: resin, plastic, wood, clay, bead, crafts, model making, aluminum / copper sheet and foil and more, very practical items in daily life.\nThe WOWSTICK hand drill is ideal DIY workers like in the drilling industry and general people. It will be a good addition to your artisan inventory. It particularly suits those who perform intricate decorations. You can use the mini drill for making holes, for crafts and more applications.\nUse Tips:\nIt is suggested to take in and out alternatively when drilling, so that the residue can be brought out without getting stuck.\nYou may test it on the spare material before use. When there is no issue, you may start drilling holes in your crafts.\nOn harder metal materials,  it is suggested to start with a smaller bit and then shift to a bigger one when it is aiming at a large hole.\nThe smaller the drill bit is, the more attention should be paid. Due to its small size, it is easy to break off when used improperly. \nNote: Be careful of the operation when you are using a finer drill bit since it is easier to break off. You may perform intricate drilling of valuable materials with its unique low speed optimization.\nWOWSTICK mini drill is more than easy to operate. With just one button built at the position of your thumb when you are holding it, you may just start working with a press on the button. When a pause is needed, you may release the button. \nTo replace the bit is also a breeze based on our particularly designed screwless locking mechanism. It is fairly intuitive and no extra tool is needed. Just gently rotate the chuck out, take out the drill bit, put in a new bit, and then secure it. The process can be accomplished within 10 seconds.\nAfter finishing the works, you may put on the drill cap to avoid accidents caused by unintentional pressing of the button. So it is a hassle-free device.\nThe drill has a built-in rechargeable lithium-ion battery so that you don\u2019t have to worry about the distance between the wall plug and workbench or troubles caused when you forget to unplug the power cord. It provides a safe, effective, clean energy, less stressful operation option. It is cordless, tailored pen-shaped designed and operates at 3.7 volts, 1.036Wh. That said, it can be used for at least one month in regular use at its full charge.\nWOWSTICK mini drill is rechargeable via USB type C charging cable. Full charging time is about 40 minutes and can be used about 2 hours.\nWOWSTICK is the sturdy, high quality handheld tool for DIY projects. The whole body is aluminum alloy one-piece molding, giving the most simplified look, comfortable grip and sturdy and durable in use.\nThe motor of the mini drill has also been heat-treated for endurance, so it can continue to work without getting heated for a long time. You will never complain about its quality build.\nWOWSTICK designers have been digging out the maximum abilities of the pen shape. From installations to actual working, creators always like to use the device instantly from idea to prototype and thus may get inspirations at the fingertips.\nIt comes with an improved ergonomic design to ensure comfortable grip in any situation. Using the aluminum alloy shell, it is ultra-compact and light, slim and very easy to handle for detailed projects. Holding it like a pen, its slim grip makes great sense in detailed works. As a result, no matter walnut or resin, you may just focus on the fun of making things.\nGo experiment with the WOWSTICK\u2019s easy drilling. Go ahead and grab your creativity now!\nThe Imezing team consists of a group of designers, engineers and seekers of quality life. Back to simplicity and convenience are our core concept.

Our co-founders, Joanna and Rivelle met while in graduate school at New York University (NYU) pursuing degrees in educational technology design and games research. \nJOANNA is a D&D enthusiast, a self-taught coder, and an emerging technology specialist. She has previously worked at the American Museum of Natural History on the Virtual Reality T-Rex exhibition and its Augmented Reality application. Before emerging tech, Joanna also worked in theatre education and various non-profit organizations for youth empowerment.\n\n\u201cI was always an introverted girl with lots of imagination. I spent lots of days in my childhood alone as my family moved quite frequently. I filled my hours with rich stories, often acting out in different voices when no one was listening. I became a warrior, a hero, a descent of mythical, powerful creatures. In my stories, I had allies, enemies, and crazy plot twists. I always felt a powerful energy deep in my heart that was waiting to be let out. As I grew up, I turned to other forms of artistic expression, but it was never quite enough. As I grew up, I turned to other forms of artistic expression, but it was never quite enough.15 years later, when I was first introduced to a game called Dungeons and Dragons, I watched as everything in my world clicked. I was me again.\u201d\n\nRIVELLE was reintroduced to the land of fantasy by Joanna and joined Cartographr in Spring 2020. She is currently doing her thesis exploring roleplay and character embodiment in fantasy games and hopes to connect this to future Cartographr add-ons. Rivelle has a rich background in Psychology and Human-Computer Interaction (UXD), which gives her the power to bridge imagined possibilities and the constrained reality. She thrives to express the right narrative through design, designing new technology that is both easy to use and intuitive because of her keen ability to empathize with users.\n\"Since I was little, I have always been drawn to the magic of stories and the art of storytelling. I dreamed of being a writer who communicates with such vivid depth and emotion that a reader would be helpless but to succumb to its pull. The best stories allowed me to connect with another path, encouraging exploration and the pursuit of knowledge in ways that the traditional world, or my reality, limited. Stories are a way to journey through another land, one filled with creativity, my lifeblood. As I grew, I went from expressing this as the art of language to the innovation of technology and design.\"\n\nFollow us on: \nInstagram: @cartographr_ar\nTwitter: @cartographr_ar\nJoin Our Discord", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis project is happening, the only factor is the potential delay of the launch date.

With area control, multiple scoring opportunities, combo driven actions, and a pinch of deck building, Dirge: The Rust Wars fits a whole lot of game in a small package with a 30 minute play time.\nDirge: The Rust Wars was strikingly Illustrated by Aaron Nakahara and Liz Lahner, designed by John Clowdus, and published by Small Box Games.\nYou should probably  check out the FAQs at some point, especially if you're not familiar with  Small Box Games and/or you're an international backer! \nThis is a short, 10 day project with clear goals and an achievable funding goal.  By backing this project, you'll receive either a physical and/or print and play Kickstarter copy of Dirge: The Rust Wars.\nAll cards are 310 GSM Black Core Linen Finish.\n\nShipping Costs for physical Rewards are as follows:\nDomestic $4 \nCanada & Mexico $14\nEuropean Union $15\nUnited Kingdom $16 \nRest of the World $18 \nYeah, I know, international shipping sucks.  I wish it didn't.  Please check the FAQ for more information. \nIn Dirge: The Rust Wars, each player will create a Warband consisting of two unique Units (there are nine unique Units, across three different Unit Types: Infantry, Cavalry, and Engines).  When a player chooses a Unit for their Warband, they get the Unit, the Unit's Stat card (which shows the Unit's Move, Attack, and Wounds, as well as a the Unit's Skill) and the Unit's two Ability cards.  These Ability cards are added to the player's starting deck (each player has a starting deck of five Ability cards).\nIn Dirge: The Rust Wars, the Turn Sequence and Action Cards drive the gameplay. The Active player with the Turn Sequence card chooses a face up Action and takes a turn by completing the top half, while the other player takes a turn completing the bottom half. Then, the Turn Sequence card is passed to the other player. When there are no face up Actions remaining, the Turn Sequence card is flipped and the round ends.\nPlayers move and attack with their Units, play powerful Ability cards, and gain control of Locations across several rounds of gameplay to score points.  At the end of a Round, if either player has scored 12 or more Victory Points, the game ends with the player with the most Victory Points winning.\nUnits move orthogonally on a 4x4 board comprised of 9 Location cards. Units can attack other adjacent Units to cause damage. When a Unit takes more Damage than it has Wounds, it is Destroyed. Destroyed Units can be Respawned at full wounds at any of the 4 corners.\nPlayers score Victory Points four different ways: 1 Victory Point for destroying an opposing Unit, 1 Victory Point for playing two or more cards during their turn, 1 Victory Point if both of their Units are on the board at the end of the round, and at the end of the round, the player controlling the most Sawgrass Sea Locations gains 1 Victory Point.\nYou can view the full rules here. \nBoard Game Barrage talk about Dirge: The Rust Wars in their latest podcast.  You should check it out!\nThere are no Stretch Goals in this project.  Everything for Dirge: The Rust Wars has been unlocked on the front end of the project, and the copy of the game you'll receive by backing this project will contain upgraded and additional items+ that will not be included in future (if any) non-Kickstarter printings of the game.*\nTwo Piece Black and Gold Foil Stamped Box (big enough for sleeves)\nPrinted 12 page rule book\n6 Plastic Slide Trackers\n*These will be limited to the Kickstarter print run, which will be a print run equal to the number of backers for a physical copy of the game, plus a +/- 10% overage.\n+Future non-Kickstarter printings of Dirge: The Rust Wars will not contain the above listed items, and will come in a tuck box.\nWhether you\u2019ve been around since 2007, or you\u2019re just now finding out about Small Box Games, thank you for taking the time to check out this project!\nSmall Box Games is a one man show that I started in 2007 with a pretty simple vision: make small, unique, domestically manufactured card  games in small print runs.  Over the past 14 years, I\u2019ve managed to  stay pretty true to that vision with Small Box Games.  While I stepped away from Small Box Games in 2017, I have been publishing my designs again as Small Box Games since 2019, and it feels great to be back doing what I love!\nThe games I design and publish, including Dirge: The Rust Wars, are hardly, if ever, available in retail (online or otherwise).

Get Me Off This Planet!\", \"The Siblings Trouble\", \"GemPacked Cards\", \"Heroes and Tricks\", \"Herbaceous\", \"Legendary Creatures\", \"Sunset Over Water\", \"Herbaceous Sprouts\", \"Heroes Welcome, \"Skulk Hollow,\" \"The One Hundred Torii,\" and \"The Whatnot Cabinet\" all successfully funded and shipped to backers. \"Herbaceous: Pocket Edition\" is shipping to backers in April. We strive to run excellent Kickstarters and deliver fantastic products.\n\n\"Floriferous\" is well-tested and balanced. The graphic design is complete and the card art is final. Box and instructions are near final and we have been working closely with our printer. Limited amounts of work will remain based on how the KS unfolds.\n\nThere are inherent risks whenever undertaking a project as complex and large as producing and distributing a board game, but we have over 6 years of experience dealing with these. We've gone out of our way to surround ourselves with experienced board game developers, distributors, and people who have run and launched successful Kickstarters. This team of friends has been exceedingly supportive and we're sure will help as we hit any upcoming bumps in the road. And there are bumps. Strikes, shortages, and shipping delays are all hard to predict.\n\nMost importantly, if something does go wrong, we will keep everyone in the loop as the project moves forward and comes to market.

We all look forward to the beautiful summer months when we can relieve the intense work pace and pandemic exhaustion. With SADE, your summer months will now be more beautiful! Enjoy a few lazy days at the beach with SADE, or maybe a family picnic at your family's favorite park. While COVID-19 has ruined travel plans for some of us, we still have a chance to take a trip to the mountains or the seaside. It is a time of lazy days to relax around the pool, take shore excursions, and vacation on sunny beaches. So, whether your vacation destination is a secluded beach in the Maldives or just your neighborhood pool, make sure you have all the essentials in your beach bag: Sunscreen, sunglasses, maybe the latest paperback novel, and of course, your soft and luxurious beach towel SADE. So let's talk about the numerous advantages of traveling with SADE in summer.\nSADE is very strong, but extra thin. This allows SADE to dry much faster than other towels. This means that there will not be a bad musty smell like regular towels. They are also extra light. This is just one of the many advantages SADE has over other towels, especially when traveling. Another advantage is that it helps to minimize the weight of your luggage! After all, who wants to carry big and thick towels in their suitcase? And when you get to your destination, they are easy to store as they take up very little space.\nSADE is woven from super long fiber, high-quality Turkish cotton (the best quality cotton grown in the world). It will not come off rough or frayed edges after a few uses. It will not wear out in any way with successive washes and drying, it will actually become softer and fluffy.In addition, you will be amazed by its super absorbency despite its lightness and thinness. This means that SADE will dry quickly in the dryer and will not eventually get the annoying musty smell that most regular cotton towels get. It will stay fresh and comfortable for years.\nAnother good thing about SADE is its versatility. Do you need a beach towel? Put one in a beach bag! Also, they are easy to carry, although they are large enough to give you good protection at the beach. In fact, you can take two SADE to the beach - slide one as a pillow behind your head and the other lying on top of the other, and look at the ocean you love on your romantic getaway! If you're going somewhere where the nights are cold, SADE is perfect as a scarf or even a shawl! It can be used for more than just beach or pool towels. Its many uses include bath towels, beach blankets, travel blankets, camping towels, yoga mats, or even a bathrobe. And you will find that SADE is soft enough to wrap your baby after bathing.\nSADE is made from Turkish Cotton - and Turkish Cotton is indeed some of the most versatile ingredients in the world. This type of cotton has much longer fibers than other types of cotton. In a towel, the rule of thumb is that the longer the fibers, the softer they are. Therefore, SADE is much smoother than its voluminous cotton competitors. And because of its super thinness, it dries very quickly, unlike the volume of a terry cloth towel! Moreover, Turkish Cotton, unlike the series production of cloth and towels that are prone to making machine, hand weaving looms generally serves in Turkey.\nThis special care ensures that Turkish cotton is of much better quality than terry cloth. We can also add that Turkish Cotton is incredibly durable, which means you can enjoy your new SADE for a very long time! And another advantage is that this gorgeous Turkish Cotton SADE makes it much softer than regular cotton towels! And the more you wash them, the softer you will see they are! This is different from other cotton towels that start to crumble and become brittle as you wash them.\nFor some people, it seems surprising that SADE is so absorbent because the material looks incredibly thin. However, it is a known fact that they absorb water better than your average terry cloth. Their secret lies in the longer cotton fibers we described above, they also affect the towel's absorbency! If you hang a SADE to dry, it dries much faster than terry cloth.Therefore, there is less time for bacteria - even mold - to settle!\nSADE's size is perfect! Because it is much thinner, unlike bulkier cotton towels, it fits more easily anywhere, whether it is a bath or a beach bag. However, it is larger than a normal-sized towel and is fully usable as a bath towel.\nThe traditional look of a SADE gives it a classic vibe that makes it stand out everywhere! Besides, SADE can have many interesting uses other than a towel. A scarf, a boat towel, sunbed cover, curtains, a blanket for new babies, and even a blanket castle for your kids!\n\n\nSade Towels\nSade Bathrobe\nSade Bathrobe\nStrong hunch, sense of responsibility, easy communication and patience of women are great advantages in the business world. This enables them to be more successful in business life. The reasons for these are not habits acquired overnight. Another reason for women's success in business life is their strong premonition. This feature increases the success graph of women in business life.\nThey can calculate and interpret ideas without seeing the future. Of course, it does not mean that it acts with the desired emotions. Again, based on data about their job, they use their foresight. Women have the ability to do many jobs together. These features also help women to be successful in business life. If you pay attention, while talking on the phone, they can read e-mail, apply nail polish, look at their notes, give instructions to others with a hand-arm sign, and mix food. Such practicality does not exist in most men. The fact that a woman rushes from her job to cook at home and take care of her children and spouses is a proof of her superior skill abilities.\nWomen are more fortunate in communication than men. They communicate more easily, and these features make it easier to overcome difficulties. Overcoming the difficulties increases the success lines. If women love their job, they are patient and resistant to all kinds of difficulties in their work, they do not give up easily, they struggle until they reach their goals. Their self-expression features are high.\nAlthough the inequalities in social, cultural and economic life between men and women in Anatolia are tried to be reduced, we cannot mention that serious progress has been made. When we look at the place of our women in working life, we unfortunately observe that they are far from male employees. Today, while the employment participation rate of men in Anatolia is around 70%, the rate of women is around 30%. This means that most of our women stay out of our working life and away from productivity and stay on the side of consumption.\nSade Towels\nThe reasons that cause this situation are; The fact that women are not welcomed to work, which is a phenomenon caused by a patriarchal social structure, can be listed as the fact that our women living in rural areas cannot be employed in qualified jobs due to the lack of sufficient education.\nWe must accept the fact that women are not only important in family life, but also in our economic life. All women, especially women living in rural areas, should be prevented from dropping out of their education, more vocational training centers should be opened to gain professional skills, and women's entrepreneurship should be opened with trainings that provide technical and vocational skills to our women, apart from the financial dimension.\nWe took a big step in this campaign to include our women in business life. We saved our housewives from their busy housework and included them in collective pieces of training such as design and weaving as a social activity and organized workshops. Our women now have the economic freedom to financially support their families.\nSADE is an enterprise that aims to empower housewives by teaching transferable skills and to ensure dignity and cultural integration in their communities with quality and traditional handicrafts. We are currently empowering many women. With this campaign, we promise a SADE of first class quality with minimalist design. In this way, you will be able to touch the life of a working woman and allow us to hire more women weavers.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs all we know, COVID-19 is the one and only ruler of the world.

Your favorite songs blasting through the speakers. Candy bar wrappers piled next to a warm drink in the cheap plastic cupholder. Your companion riding in the passenger seat, snapping pictures of landmarks as you settle into the hypnotic rhythm of the road. But be careful: this fun road trip could get dangerous as you drive through Death Valley.\n\nDeath Valley is a pocket-sized, push-your-luck, tableau building game for 1-2 players, with each traveler striving to assemble the best mix of cards in their Journey and Scrapbook in order to win the game.\nDeath Valley is 18 cards, packaged in a portable and durable wallet.\n\nEach turn, players will choose whether to assign a card to their Journey, or move cards from their Journey to their Scrapbook. Cards feature stars (points), special abilities (affect the value and position of cards), and some interesting facts about Death Valley.\n\nEach card also has a hazard (Heat, Terrain, Flood or Animals) listed. Having 3 of the same Hazard visible in their tableau will cause the player to bust and lose all the progress in their Journey.\nAll 4 hazards and their card distribution within the game.\nAt the end of the game the player with the most stars in their Journey, plus any additional points from card abilities, is the winner.\nTo set up the game, shuffle all 18 cards and place 1 face-up between the players. On a player\u2019s turn they have 3 choices: add the face-up or face-down card from the top of the deck to their own Journey, or Rest. When a player Rests, they move at least one card from their Journey to their Scrapbook (stacking them into a single pile if they select multiple cards) and shuffle as many of their remaining Journey cards into the deck as they choose.\nAfter the player takes their action for the turn, they check for Hazards among the visible cards in their Journey and Scrapbook. If they have 3 of the same Hazard type showing (3 Flood cards, for example) the player busts: 1 of the Hazard cards is removed from the game and the rest of the player\u2019s Journey cards get shuffled back into the deck.\nOnce there is only one card remaining in the center area, the game ends. Each player counts up the stars showing in their Journey row. Visible cards in the Journey and Scrapbook might have abilities that adjust that score. Once all effects have been applied, the player with the highest star count is the winner.\nBackseat Driver Variant\nIf you want to really press your luck and give up a little control, try out the Backseat Driver Variant. In this variant players may choose to play the face-up card on their opponent\u2019s journey as well as their own. At the end of each turn you will check to see if either player busts.\nSolo Mode - Designed by Kevin Ellenburg and Mike Mullins\nThe game will come with rules for solo play. Here you will face an AI explorer that thinks through its action each turn similarly to a player (playing the more intense Backseat Driver Variant). This explorer never rests in its pursuit of adventure.\nIf you would like to try the game yourself, the mostly black and white preview PNP is available at PNP Arcade now!\nhttps://www.pnparcade.com/products/death-valley-kickstarter-preview\nIn previous campaigns we created expansion material and used it as stretch goals. Since 2018, we've just given it away from the start. So no worries on whether we'll hit it or not, you are getting bonus content if you pledge here. The free expansion for this campaign is Death Valley: Panamint City.\nThis expansion consists of 6 more cards, letting you customize the deck before playing Death Valley. Before play, organize all the base game and expansion cards by hazard type. Then select 3 Animal, 4 Flood, 5 Terrain, and 6 Heat cards to shuffle into the deck. Unselected cards will not be used. Includes Vultures, Panamint City, Red Cathedral, Ubehebe Crater, Zabriskie Point, and Panamint Dunes.\nHere are the rewards available during this campaign.\n\nTo add more games to your order, you can do one of a few things:\nUS Backers only - to order games that ship now - go to our website http://www.buttonshygames.com and place an order using the coupon code \"0321us\" to get 15% off  of your order. Your website order will ship now, as long as you don't  order any pre-order items, otherwise the entire order will ship as  soon as everything comes in. As always, if you reach $25.00, you will  also receive free shipping. (NOTE: We previously offered a US Backer  code to combine games to save on shipping, but in most cases this was a  much better deal of free shipping AND 15% off.)\nInternational Backers only - go to our website http://www.buttonshygames.com and place an order using the coupon code \"0321international\" (REPEAT: THIS IS FOR BACKERS ONLY) to get free shipping on your extra game(s). Note: The limit on this  offer is 3 wallet games (and up to 3 expansions) total, including  anything that you order at Kickstarter. Anything above 3 wallet games  (and 3  expansions)  will end up bumping into the next shipping tier,  which can be as much as  $10 on international orders. These games will  all ship together with your Kickstarter rewards.\nThere are many notable games and we'll be featuring those throughout the campaign.\nWhile the game includes lots of great little historical facts about Death Valley, here's a little history about the game itself.\nDeath Valley was originally Kevin Ellenburg's entry to the 18 Card Challenge: Design A Game About A Real Life Location, and we\u2019re happy to see it coming to life. It has a unique take on the familiar push-your-luck mechanic where players have to think about managing their hazards as well as the card abilities, making each choice matter beyond the immediate threat of busting. On top of that, the gorgeous art from Fachri Maulana perfectly captures the lonely beauty of Death Valley National Park.\nFirst up is Kevin's initial pitch video in it's entirety (note some changes were made to the gameplay and cards throughout development):\nAnd here is the 18 Card Challenge video where it was a finalist, along with two other games that we eventually published, Skulls of Sedlec and Horreos. All 3 of which are available here. \n\n\nWe have an awesome following of repeat customers. As a result, we've built the Board Game of the Month Club.\nIt's a subscription service where you receive unreleased microgames,   promo cards, expansion content, and Kickstarter discounts ... every   month! Supporters also receive from $1 to $10 off EVERY WALLET GAME  that  we make. (Members back our Kickstarter projects at the $1 pledge  level  above.)\nOur 2021 $5+ packages include an episode of The Final Lightyear.\nGather your crew and gear and launch into a  fringe section of space where the law teeters over the edge and a good  captain can earn a living. There's no shortage of threats that endanger  the goodfolk of deep space, but luckily your torpedo bay is full and  lasers are hot.\nIn Lightyear you'll play solo or cooperative with a friend, as the  captain of a so-called starship, in hopes of earning some rewards and a  decent rep. Using tactical maneuvering and dice-based action selection,  you'll work through the sector's small, medium and large enemies trying  to gain rewards and ultimately live to see another day. Customizable  episodes will challenge you with variable enemies and threats while  offering powerful new gear and talented crew to help you in your  adventures.\nOur $10 packages include all of the above and something   extra. Generally it's a tiny game (up to 9 cards), or some expansion  / promo cards for our existing games.\nAnd our $20 package includes all of the above and a copy of   the featured wallet game (or the wallet game of your choice).   The featured wallet games also come with any expansion material that  is given away in the Kickstarter campaigns (like the Panamint City expansion  here).\nIf that sounds cool to you, check out the Board Game of the Month Club on Patreon!\nhttp://www.patreon.com/buttonshy\nThank you for checking out Death Valley!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWith our method of publishing and using multiple manufacturers, there's always a chance that one part of the game could come in with an error, leading to delays.

Simply pick a theme, start drawing, and Dungeon Alchemist creates high-quality maps you can print, share, or use in your favourite Virtual Tabletop Application.\nDungeon Alchemist is a standalone software app for Windows, Mac (including ARM) and Linux, which will be distributed through the Steam platform. We plan to release Dungeon Alchemist near the end of 2021, but the exact timeline depends on how much money is pledged in this campaign. If you choose to opt for an Adventurer (\u20ac45) or higher pledge, you'll get access to the beta program a few months before release.\nWe will unveil new features as we progress further in the campaign. If we surpass our funding goal, we will add even more content and features to Dungeon Alchemist for everyone to enjoy! Check out the stretch goals below.  \nDungeon Alchemist was created by Wim De Hert and Karel Crombecq, both longtime roleplayers. This project came from a personal need for an easy-to-use, convenient tool for making dungeon maps. Both working a fulltime job, we just don\u2019t have the time to design each map in excruciating detail, but we still want cool-looking tailor-made encounters for our campaigns. That\u2019s why we believe Dungeon Alchemist can really make a difference, and we are incredibly passionate about making it.\nWe would love to make Dungeon Alchemist available to everyone at a low price and with amazing content from the start. But the reality is that we have bills to pay, and to make this project as good as we want it to be, we need money to fund development. We truly believe it has the potential to be a game-changer, and we created this Kickstarter because we simply cannot build it without your help.\nWim De Hert is owner and founder of BlueJay Design Consultancy, and has over 20 years of experience in illustration and graphic design. While being an avid Pathfinder and Dungeon&Dragons player for as long as he can remember, creating Dungeon Alchemist has been an ambition ever since getting a fantasy game at the age of 7. Wim will be working on Dungeon Alchemist\u2019s lead visuals, concept design and modelling.\nKarel is an experienced game developer and senior graphics programmer. Karel has been in the game industry for over 10 years and has released games on mobile platforms and consoles. Before that, he earned a PhD at the University of Antwerp on machine learning and computer simulation. With a passion for video games and RPG\u2019s in particular and lots of experience programming games and AI algorithms, Karel is the perfect person to tackle this job! \nWe are a two-man team and we do everything ourselves. This means that we can use all the help we can get to spread the love! The more money we collect in this Kickstarter, the more time we can spend on developing Dungeon Alchemist and adding cool new features, and the quicker our app will be finished. Everybody wins!\nIf you want to help us fulfil our dream, you can do so in several ways:\nJoin our Discord Server and engage with the community.\nTell everyone about us on Facebook.\nFollow, retweet and engage with Dungeon Alchemist on Twitter.\nTalk about us on your favourite subreddit:  /r/battlemaps, /r/dnd, /r/dndmaps, /r/Pathfinder_RPG, /r/Roll20, /r/FoundryVTT,  /r/FantasyGrounds, ...\nThis campaign is promoted by Backercamp.

Since then, the feedback (begging and pleading) has continued, so we were sure to provide LOTS of Dice Jails and Dice Vaults in this campaign. So, what are they? Dice Jails are intended to punish bad dice in style. Dice Vaults are for less naughty dice who need a place to stay for the night... or until their next adventure commences. \n_______________________________________________________________\nEASY TO PRINT!

All Dice towers are designed to work with standard 20mm dice at 100% scale. (*Dice set/tower scales are determined by the size of the D20 in the set.) If you can't print the towers at 100%, then print them at 60% to work with tiny 12mm dice sets (can be found in local game stores or on Amazon.) Teeeny tiny printers such as the Photon and Mars are unlikely to print the majority of dice towers AND work with existing dice. However, Dice Jails and Vaults may work, depending on size and scale. \n (Photo of actual printed objects ^) \nActual Resin print\n_______________________________________________________________\nHave bigger dice? No problem! You can 3D print these files at any scale (*that your printer can support!). Use the dice scaler tab in the PRODUCTION SCHEDULE to determine scale. \n_______________________________________________________________\nWhat printers are supported? All files will be designed to fit within 7\" square print areas (Prusa Mini). Files will be split vertically to fit taller printers.      \nPrinted in Resin (60%)\n_______________________________________________________________\nI don't have a 3D printer, how do I get a physical product? Although we won\u2019t be selling physical prints through this campaign, we will be offering a Merchant tier that allows the sale of physical prints of all 15 core products, plus ALL unlocked stretch goals. We had a plethora of Merchants with our previous campaign, and we expect (hope) we can duplicate the same success here! \n_______________________________________________________________\nWill you be including 6 tray types for towers in this campaign? Sadly, no. Instead of offering 6 simple trays, we wanted to focus on unique designs for each tray for this campaign.  All tower files will come with one removable tray. Our hope is to include spaces to hold dice, but all trays may not have a great spot for dice. Trays will be only one size, one type. In collecting feedback from the previous campaign, we found that the majority of backers were printing the same trays (large.) If we get enough feedback, we may consider an additional tray type (OpenLock perhaps?) but at this moment, one tray is what is being offered in this campaign.\nTrays that are too large for our 7\"x7\"x7\" print minimum will be split into parts using puzzle shapes for easy assembly. \n_______________________________________________________________\nCan you teach me how to 3D Print? We have a Fates End Print Support Group on Facebook for all backers with lots of volunteers who can help you get started. Many of our backers from the previous campaign were first time printers, and were able to get up and running with the help of our volunteers. \nWe will send the Facebook Link out to all backers after the campaign funds (usually two weeks after the campaign ends.)\n_______________________________________________________________\n When will I get the files? \nEach object will take about 1 week to model, print test, repair and deliver. GM screen(s) will take two weeks. Please check the PRODUCTION SCHEDULE for Release dates.\nThose who back the FatesEnd #1 & #2 or Dual License tiers will receive their FatesEnd #1 files after this campaign funds (*usually two weeks after the campaign ends.)\n_______________________________________________________________ \n\nQuotes from backers of FatesEnd 1 (previous campaign):     \n_______________________________________________________________\nPrevious Campaign (FatesEnd 1)\nIf you're interested in adding files from the previous FatesEnd campaign (FatesEnd1), but you'd like to see them first, you can find renders, photos and details here. \nPLAY\n\n_______________________________________________________________\nImprovements\nWe'll be fulfilling orders from this campaign through Backerkit! We're hoping for a better/clearer process for file access this time around. \n\nSince this is our 2nd campaign, we learned a lot from the previous one. We believe this experience will help us communicate more effectively to help fulfillment run smoothly! \n_______________________________________________________________\n MERCHANTS \n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>IMPORTANT NOTICE<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<\nNew Merchants: The Merchant license from this campaign does not apply to the previous campaign (FatesEnd1) If you want to sell FatesEnd1 assets, we offer the Dual License for new Merchants.\nMerchants from FatesEnd1: you do not need to purchase a Dual License since you already have a license to sell assets from FatesEnd1 (The first campaign). However, if you wish to sell assets from this campaign (FatesEnd2), you must back the Merchant License tier.\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>><<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<\nOur Merchant program in our previous campaign was a huge success! Many Merchants sold so many towers/dice jails from the previous campaign, they were able to expand their print space into a full fledged printer farm! Some Merchants were even able to convert their printing hobby into a full time job from selling FatesEnd merch! To be clear, we can't guarantee the success of every Merchant (that's honestly up to you), but it was fun to see the success of many of our Merchants, especially those who were actively engaged on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, etc.\nIMPORTANT NOTE: No one is permitted to sell prints form this campaign (FatesEnd2) unless they back the Merchant License tier, or the Dual License Tier from this campaign. Selling/giving away files is strictly prohibited. \n______________________________________________________________\nLicense duration: The license is good for a full 24 months from the date of the last released file. The more stretch goals we unlock, the longer you can sell! \n______________________________________________________________\nMerchant ID. To protect our Merchants and their investment, every Merchant receives a unique Merchant ID. This makes it easy to spot sellers who haven't acquired a Merchant License and put a stop to their piracy (Yarrrrr! Avast ye swabs!)   \n Special note for FatesEnd1 Merchants: for those of you who back the FE2 Merchant tier (this campaign) We'll make sure your IDs have the same number as your FE1 ones.\nRestrictions: You may use FateEnd watermarked renders in your listings, however please don\u2019t use Fates End photos to promote your sales. Please use your own photos when listing for sales (you may use concept art until 1 week after finalized files are delivered.  \nWatermarked Render Example\n ______________________________________________________________\nMerchant-Only FB Support Group\nWe have a Merchant-only Facebook support group where you can all share photos of your prints, ask questions and help support one another. \nIf you want to get a Merchant License, but you're still not sure which tier to back, please check this handy for further clarification:\nDual Licenses are only for new merchants who wish to sell prints from both campaigns.  \nFatesEnd 1 Merchants already have the right to sell files from FatesEnd1. Please do not back the Dual License tier if you already have a Merchant License from the previous campaign. Please back the Merchant License tier.\n\nMerchant Licenses and Dual Licenses from campaign 2 will not be issued until campaign 2 funds (two weeks after the end of the campaign.)\n\nThe new campaign does not limit the Merchant License duration from the previous campaign (FatesEnd 1) in any way.\n\n****SPECIAL FOR ALL Fates End 1 MERCHANTS**** If we get more than 20 Dual-License ($550)backers in this campaign, we will extend ALL MERCHANT LICENCE durations from the FIRST campaign to match the end date of FatesEnd 2 licenses!

", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is my second campaign. The first one blasted past all of my expectations. I've learned a lot from the process, and although we had a few hiccups in the beginning, I believe, in the end, that it was a successful campaign. We have an active community of backers who support one another, and to me, that's the biggest success I could have hoped for.\n\nI feel that there is very little risk this time around. I own all the software, hardware and a lot of learnings from the previous campaign. \n\nChallenge 1: Manufacturing/modeling easy to print items\nSolution - Experience! I\u2019ve been 3D Printing since 2015 and modeling since 2013. In that time, I\u2019ve learned how to create models that don\u2019t require supports, rafts or high infill. (Honestly, complex creations that require supports are the BANE of 3D printing! Many swarings have happened in this house due to the struggles of printing items that require complex supports.) I have owned 11+ printers (no kidding!) We currently have 3 Prusa MK3\u2019s, 3 Prusa Minis, an Elegoo Saturn and a Anycubic Mono X.\n\nChallenge 2: Time\nSolution - Self-employed! I have the time planned out to create the remaining files for this campaign. I have the software, hardware, skill and experience, all I need is time. I am self-employed so I have complete control over my time! All I have to do is schedule the time in, and boom - we\u2019re on track!\nBy funding this project, you make it possible for me to focus on this project instead of client work for a time.

Providing models all round to community members in some of the most popular campaign offered in Digital on Kickstarter.\n\nAll Core models have already been created and will be delivered directly after the Kickstarter end, when payment is received. So no waiting more than necessary for your core files. All Stretch Goals have also been completed, but need to be tested and will be available shortly after that.\n\nDIGITAL MEDIA: We strive to produce models that will print with as little support and parts as possible. Some models print in one go whilst most are split up into parts which must be printed separately and then assembled.\n\nThe file format of choice will be .STL and the models shall be zipped and made available to the user for download. The user is responsible for downloading their product and must have a valid internet connection and email with which to collect their reward, via internet download. We will keep the files on our system for at least three months after the first date of issue. The user must ensure that he collects the files within this time frame or risk forfeit. Lovecraft will always try their utmost to ensure that you receive your files and we hope that you enjoy printing them as much as we have enjoyed creating them. If there are any issues please contact support@i-lovecraft.com\n\nBackers must realize that the resolution you obtain on your print is down to the system you use. Our high resolution files will give you almost render quality prints on high end Resin machines, whilst the same files will produce lesser resolution prints on standard FDM printers. At any rate, the files have been previously tested on Resin and FDM printers and have shown satisfactory produce.\n\nWe recommend FDM Prints with at least a 400micron nozzle and 150 micron layer height for terrain. A 120 micron layer height will give you outstanding prints all round.\n\nResin printers should have no problems obtaining excellent resolution and finish, even at 100 micron layer height although 50 micron layer height is recommended for minute sculpt detail clarity. Although miniatures and figurines can be split into smaller parts, large terrain pieces will require a standard 220x220mm print bed, standard for FDM Printers like the 'Ender3'. We do try to restrict the maximum size of models to 180mm sq where possible.\n\nWe supply the user with a design that has been tested on conventional home hobby printers and is proven to print. All the models are tested and sliced with 'Cura' software which is freeware and available to all backers for use. We recommend that backers use 'Cura' as it is fully tested with our models and we can offer customer support, if any problems are encountered. We are unable to give customer support for other slicing software and backers use this at their own risk.\n\nAll the files have been checked using Netfab, this means that PrusaSlicer should have no problems slicing these files. Many of the files are also tested using PrusaSlicer.\n\nAll accumulated Grab Bag, Bonus models, also known as Daily Bonus or Free Models are given freely, under no obligation, as is and as a gift and don't form part of the campaign or responsibilities associated with this.\n\nWhen using our digital media, we do not hold ourselves responsible for the production or manufacturing process of the design, this is exclusively up to the user.\n\nUsers may modify models and files at their own risk and only for their own personal use. Modified files are not guaranteed by us and as such, users do this under their own risk and know how.\n\nThe Images shown on the campaign page are just for visualization and although they may come very close, they may not be an exact representation of the final design or printed model, which may vary.\n\nWe reserve the right to alter any of the models shown, at any time, before delivery, with the intent of improving the design, or efficiency of production.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nSomething else\nDigital distribution, no impact to the environment", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u20ac1 or more", "title": "Super Backer and Add-on", "descp": "Help us by contributing and following this project.

Miniatures in the game will come unpainted.\nIn Tiny Epic Dungeons players control a band of Heroes exploring a treacherous dungeon in search of the fearsome Dungeon Boss.\nHeroes make their way through the dungeon one room at a time. Around every corner goblins and ferocious minions seek to block the Heroes\u2019 path.  Where there isn\u2019t an enemy, traps are set, ready to spring on even the most prepared Hero.\nTiny Epic Dungeons features a modular dungeon that is unique with each play.\nThe game is played over 2 ACTS: the Dungeon and the Dungeon Boss. In both acts the players are constantly struggling against the waning firelight of their torch which decreases each turn. When the torch goes out, the Heroes are forever lost in the darkness.\nAfter clearing the dungeon of all its minions and finding the entrance to the lair, players must engage in an epic battle against the Boss. Each boss has unique abilities and a lair with a unique environment that gives various advantages and disadvantages depending on the skill used and where the Hero attacks from.\nThese Epic Monsters cannot be slain by mere swords, axes, arrows, and the occasional spell. Ritual Rooms around the dungeon must be used to lower their magical bond to the dungeon. The Dungeon boss must be lured to these rooms to lower their defenses and allow the Heroes to strike the final blow!\nVictory in Tiny Epic Dungeons is achieved by defeating the Dungeon Boss!\nIn order to do that, the Heroes will need to collect Legendary Loot, and Supreme Spells. \nHeroes of old crafted loot to honor the ways of their clans. Bear, Lion, Phoenix, and Panther. Heroes can discover pieces from these ancient sets that grow more powerful the more you collect. \nWill you be the greatest warrior the Bear clan has ever seen?

Except, they are not like normal goblins.  When you defeat a Mixy Goblin, something explodes! You'll draw a Potion Card to see what the effect is. Each Potion Card will describe a peril that occurs when you kill a Mixy Goblin and will also leave you with a handy potion for use later!\nAdditionally,  the mini expansion brings new Dungeon Bosses, Minions and Goblins to the game.

It can be prone to many mistakes and delays, even for experienced publishers.\n\nWe are proud to say that we're prepared for the task at hand and have years of experience in successfully producing board games and fulfilling Kickstarter projects.\n\nHere are the steps we take to prepare and reduce the likelihood of mistakes and delays:\n\n1. We have done significant pre-production. This includes having all the illustrations for the game complete and the graphic art over 95% complete. The production quote is in hand and ready to be initiated.\n\n2. We are working with an experienced manufacturing partner. We are familiar with their production requirements, timelines, payment schedules, communication methods and Chinese freight arrangements and costs for when it comes time for shipping. We will provide tracking information for the boat when the games leave China.\n\n3. We are working with an experienced fulfillment partner. We are confident that they can handle any amount of work we send their way. They have fulfilled many projects and have proven to be communicative, punctual and respectful when dealing with our customers.\n\nAbove all, I am 100% dedicated to backer communication. I will be transparent with our process and involve our backers as much as possible. I will be present daily during the project to answer any questions and I read every comment.

Also great as a travel game to take on holiday or when you're out with friends. It plays in 20-40 minutes for players aged 8+. It's quick to learn but strategic, learn from your enemy and try to get inside their mind to work out what sequence they will lay their cards down.  Artwork by Adrian Stone.\nThis game condenses Operation Market Garden into standard deck of 54 cards, making it highly portable.\nQuick to setup and learn with minimal rules.\nContains historical references so can also be used as a teaching tool.\nFun and accessible to all age groups and non gamers.\nStrategy as well as luck.\nOriginal artwork.\nRecreating the largest airborne invasion in history, Operation Market Garden in World War 2.  Use your battle and tactic cards to out smart your opponent, use your equipment wisely, reveal events and monitor your divisions. Can you win enough battles to secure the vital bridges, will you be able to capture and hold all of them in time? \nEach game will have the following cards.\n3 rule cards (double sided)\n1 Victoria Cross card\n5 Bridge Cards\n7 Allied Battle Cards\n7 German Battle Cards\n3 Allied Equipment Cards\n3 German Equipment Cards\n3 Allied Tactic Cards\n3 German Tactic Cards\n5 Allied Division Cards\n14 Event Cards\nYou can visit my Facebook page Littlebighorngames to view how to play all my games, the link is below.\n https://www.facebook.com/littlebighorngames/videos/?ref=page_internal \nIf you like what you see, please feel free to like the page as well.\nI have also created a youtube video for this game link below\n https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MY2h7Q6TiUI&feature=youtu.be \nOperation Market Garden has also been reviewed by Matt White who has launched several successful Kickstarters.  Please see his link below.\nOperation Market Garden card game Review - YouTube\nI recently did an interview about the game with The Players Aid link below.\n https://theplayersaid.com/2021/01/11/interview-with-thomas-lee-designer-of-operation-market-garden-pocket-card-game-from-little-bighorn-games-coming-to-kickstarter-january-15th/ \nMore artwork is also available to see on the instagram page link below.\n https://www.instagram.com/littlebighorngames/ \n\nThe rules for this particular game are below, they consist of 3 double sided cards.\nRule Card 1 (Double sided)\nRule Card 2 (Double sided)\nRule Card 3 (Double Sided)\nThe aim of the game is to capture all 5 bridges just like in the campaign, these can be laid out on the play area all together in a line and revealed as each bridge is won or just placed individually.\nThe 5 bridge cards and the back of the cards.\nEach player will have 7 battle cards and will use one each battle, whoever has the highest score wins the battle, whoever wins the most battles wins the bridge.  The Allied player must win the bridge to carry on, a draw or loss ends their game. The key of the game is to work out what sequence you opponent will lay their cards down.  What cards have they already used?  What sequence did they use last bridge? Do they have a favorite combination of cards? Can the event card help you get an advantage?\nWhen should you use the Victoria Cross card, use it now or save it for a later battle?\nWhich Division cards have been affected, does the German player favour certain ones?\nCan I make my opponent use their most powerful card on my weakest card?  Should I go on the attack the first few battles or hold back?\nYou can take it in turns to be the Allied player to see who can win the most bridges.\nThe 7 Allied Battle cards and the back of the cards\nThe 7 German Battle Cards and the back of the cards.\nIn addition to their battle cards, each player will have 3 equipment cards, which they can combine with their battle & tactic cards to increase their total points value but use them wisely as they can only be used once a bridge unless stated on an event card or using a Victoria Cross (see later)\nThe 3 Allied and 3 German Equipment cards.\nIn addition to their battle cards, each player will have 3 tactic cards, which they can combine with their battle & equipment cards to affect the outcome of a battle but use them wisely as they can only be used once a bridge unless stated on an event card or using a Victoria Cross (see later)\nThe 3 Allied and 3 German Tactic cards\nThe backs of the Allied & German Equipment & Tactic cards.\nIn addition to Battle, Equipment and Tactic cards there are also event cards which can influence battles.  On the first bridge only the event cards with a 1 in the top right hand corner are used, these generally favour the Allied player and reflect the events in the actual operation.\nThe 7 Event cards to be used on the first bridge plus back of the cards.\nIf the Allied player wins the first bridge on the second bridge an additional 7 event cards are shuffled in to form a new event deck, these generally favour the German player and reflect the events in the actual campaign.\nThe 7 Event cards added to the event deck on the 2nd Bridge.\nIn addition to the cards above the Allied player also has 5 Division cards.  I wanted to reflect the effects on the Divisions and their fighting capabilities as the battle wore on.\nThese start the game on 3 if the German player wins a battle he can choose to change the current event card or reduce one Division card by 1 rotating it accordingly.  Once at zero the effect on the cards kicks in.  These cards are never reset at the start of the next bridge they remain as they are, the more bridges the Allied players wins he will find his tactically and equipment options will reduce.  These cards can be used straight away or added after a few games.\n5 Allied Division cards and the back of the cards.\nIn order to give the Allied player a fighting chance of winning the game or winning a few bridges, I wanted to bring in a final element which again reflecting the actual campaign.  During the battle 5 Victoria Crosses were won for outstanding bravery.  This card can only be used 5 times so use wisely. There are several ways it can be used as below this is also stated on the rules cards.\nChange the current event card at the start of a battle.\nStop the German player reducing a Division card by 1\nAdd 1 point to your total score at the end of the battle once total scores have been revealed.\nGain 1 random tactic card back once all 3 have been used.\nGain 1 random equipment card back once all 3 have been used.\nThe Allied Victoria Cross card.\nThe game comes in a sturdy two piece cardboard box, I could have made this a stretch goal but I wanted to offer this day one to all backers.\nThe two piece box for the game.\nIf you like a game that is quick to setup, learn, play, highly portable, fun, has elements of luck, memory and quick thinking, I believe you will like Operation Market Garden.  Gamers and non gamers will enjoy it.\nHowever if you like more in-depth strategy, rules and a longer game then it may not be for you.\nCopies of my other Kickstarter games will be available during the Kickstarter except Eastern Front which has now sold out, however I still have a few promotional copies of Eastern Front which I will be offering in a free prize draw if certain targets are hit.  My very first game Western Front will also be available.\nLittle Bighorn Games\nHere are a few comments from Boardgamegeek about my games;\n\nEasy to learn, fast paced bluffing game with fantastic artwork! We usually play lomng games (Gloomhaven, Memoir Blackstone Fortress, ...) but when we don't feel like setting one up, we always grab this one or its predecessor Operation Overlord.  Good fun and easy to pack when going on a holiday.\n\nWell balanced, fast, thematic and excellent fun even when you are losing. Mixes a good historical theme with a tense bluffing game that really makes you think how to sequence your card plays.\n\nGot the Kickstarter- played the game quite a few times with other gamers and family. Great fun, plays quick, bluff card tactics work well and great historic theme.  Has a lot of strategy for a simple, easy to explain game. Cards look great and quality product.  Currently one of our favorite go to quick war-game.\n\nVery good fast paced game. Very historical too (and a very strong art direction and illustrations). I strongly recommend it.\n\nGood little filler, like the bluff mechanism not a huge amount of depth to it but definitely what I would classify as good for the pub.\n\nEnjoyed this game much more than I thought. Fun \"guess what your opponent is going to do\" game. This one is similar to Eastern Front (WWII), but deals with Western Front in WWI. For such a small game, does a really good job of simulating the futility of trench warfare and the stalemate that this created. Small size, small table space, and quick game play makes this a perfect game for my collection - travel, high school game club, lunchtime game.\n\nFun little game. My 14 year old son takes great satisfaction in kicking my b**t with this one.\n\nA quality game! Quick to set up and learn, and incredibly fun card game to play. This game is always in our luggage when we go away on holiday. Highly recommended.\n\nI also conceived the game to be a helpful teaching tool, so was absolutely delighted with this feedback.\nHello! I just wanted to send you a message to tell you about my experience with your Western Front game.\nI won it in a raffle at handycon, and it had sat on a shelf for a few months. But recently my autistic nephew (my main gaming partner) has taken a huge and deep interest in world war history, and so I brought it off the shelf to play and it really worked well with him! He loved the attention to details with the cards and he liked the event cards for example the Brits getting support from the USA. Every card we flipped over he would make up a mini story about how the battle progressed with the tanks advancing against the infantry for example.\n  He LOVED when the cards had unique art, for example he got really excited when the Red Baron card was different from the British plane.\n  In closing I just wanted to tell you that it worked really well for him and he is asking to play it over and over (the last game to make him like this was SOS Titanic so you are in good company next to Bruno Cathala!) and since you are a small company I wanted to let you know that you have our support in the future.\n\nI was also lucky enough to get some Pupils at Wycombe Abbey School to play Western Front, their History Teacher Mr N George said;\n\"We love how quick the game is to set up \u2013 you can jump into it in a matter of minutes. The best thing about it is how thematic it is \u2013 everything from the names and artwork on the attack cards to the descriptions on the event cards gives you a really good feel for the period.\nThe event cards are one of our favourite bits, and they teach an important lesson, which is that you can\u2019t plan for every eventuality \u2013 sometimes you have no choice but to use the hand you\u2019ve got as best you can. This is much the same situation as the WW1 commanders faced, so do they deserve the blame they often get?\nI think from the perspective of a History teacher these games are useful in that they get the kids asking questions and give them a feel for the period. So, thank you once again!\"\nThese will not be traditional stretch goals like other campaigns, I could have made the box a stretch goal but I wanted to offer this day one.  Instead during the campaign I will have prize draws once certain targets are reached.  The prize draws will be done after the campaign ends and the free games added to the winners pledge.  Here are the targets.\nFunded 1 copy of Western Front added to the prize draw\n100 New Facebook Likes 1 copy of Operation Market Garden added.\n100 New Followers on instagram 1 copy of Battle of Britain added.\n200 backers 1 copy of D-Day Operation Overlord added.\n250 backers 1 copy of Eastern Front added.\n300 backers 1 copy of Eastern Front added.\n350 backers 1 copy of Eastern Front added.\n400 backers 1 backer gets their entire pledge for free. This will be refunded after the campaign ends.\nPostage is added during the campaign so you know day one how much you will pay. I'm aiming to get the Kickstarter delivered by October 2021.\nLike many people I love games and have backed over 150 projects on kickstarter. With the success of my first three Kickstarters I have been able to do another, and here it is!\nI'm currently working on several new card games and have working prototypes for the following, Wolf Pack, Enigma and Bomber Command.\nWolf Pack will be my first game which will potentially allow up to 8 players to play it, which I am super excited about.\nI also have a working prototype for a World War Weird solitaire card game called 'Hurtgen Horror' \nI have already had three successful Kickstarters, so I'm confident I can deliver again.

In addition, these buildings house a wide array of monstrous foes, magic items of varying power, and new mechanics!\nThis book is more than it seems. These taverns are laced with their own secrets, hidden histories and locked doors. But more than internal stories, the book itself serves as a guide to the hidden lore of its most prevalent characters.

Because it changes shape every time you visit! Using dozens of room tiles and a table with descriptions, have your players run through a potentially endless maze of rooms. If you add the arcane haze variant, filling every guest's mind with rage, you can potentially use this tavern as a standalone roguelike board game! \nIf you grab our custom card deck, you can fully immerse yourself in a newly designed game for standard playing cards.

The models were created by 3D scanning real world trees, so they're extremely lifelike (Only mini). \n\nWhy we did it.\nAn essential element of scenery for fantasy tabletop adventuring games is trees. If you imagine traveling through the woods, you imagine a densely forested area with many trees covering the landscape. Other than the visible path ahead or behind, trees block the line-of-sight in all other directions.\nAchieving the feel of a dense forest in a tabletop gaming scenario is difficult for several reasons:\nMiniature trees typically block your view of your characters\nMiniature trees get in the way of being able to move your characters\nMiniature trees are not usually very realistic\nRealistic tree models are a lot of work to make\nRealistic tree models are often fragile\nRealistic tree models take up a lot of storage space to prevent them from being broken\n\nThe Solution.\n3D-scanned, 3D-printable Trees! (This is reward tree 5)\nWe have created 3D printable tree models by 3D-scanning the geometry from real-world tree trunks. By design, our models do not have the leafy parts of the trees so you can see your character models even if they are right next to a tree. Since the models lack the fragile leaf-parts of typical model trees, they can be conveniently stored together in a bin or drawer. The geometry is so tree-like, we've found that we get a very convincing representation of a tree without needing the leaves.\nA real tree and its corresponding digital model\nYou can create scenery that is very reminiscent of a forest by printing these same few tree models at different sizes and positioning them around the tabletop.\nThe same tree model printed at 100% XY-scale on the left and 150% Scale on the right. Bigfoot for scale\nWith just a few of these realistic tree models, you can make an entire forest by printing the trees at different scales and scattering them randomly around the landscape.\n\n Free sample.\nYou can 3D print \"Tree 3\" right now for free. All I ask is that you share this kickstarter on facebook via the link on this webpage. We set it up so that once you do, the download button will reveal itself.\n\nEasy to print.\nThese models print easily and support free on FDM-style printers. Many of the trees can even be printed with zero infill because there are no internal overhangs. Depending on your printer's bridging capability, you might need to print with no top layers if you try to print zero-infill.\n\nTerms & Conditions\nAs a backer, upon successful completion of this Kickstarter campaign you will be rewarded with a license to print and use a set of model files for non-commercial use only. You may not sell, share or distribute any of the digital files or derivative works based on the files. You may modify the files for personal use only. You may not create any derivative works, including printed models, that are to be used in a commercial manner.\nYou will be granted a non-exclusive, non-sublicensable, non-transferable license to download, access, and 3D print these model files for the purpose of your own personal use, for your own storage, retention and reference.

Some of the most important missions that took place between 1957-1968 were charted on a beautiful graphic entitled \"The Conquest of Space\" that was issued in 1968 by a Swiss printing company. This magnificent chart displayed the flight paths of these missions and also featured the paths of satellites, and probes to the moon, Mars, and Venus. \nNow, this chart has been fully restored, recolored, and - with your support - will be launched as a special limited-edition reissue.\nThe Conquest of Space Chart\nThis reissue of The Conquest of Space chart will measure 26\" x 36\" ( 2.16' x 3'/66cm x 91cm ). It will be printed on 80lb glossy cover stock with a UV coating and feature a 1/4\" border - in black - so it will be easy to frame. \nClose-Up Detail\nThe chart is printed in two languages - English and French - with an easy-to-read legend on the side that helps you identify which spacecraft are manned/unmanned and belonging to which country. \nThe Details are Amazing!\nThe Conquest of Space chart was first released in 1968 in Switzerland and today it is very difficult to find. Even if one was lucky enough to hunt down one, it would have crease lines running through it because the original charts were issued folded. \nThe Original Chart\nI have restored the graphics on the poster, eliminated these crease lines, brought out the vibrancy of the original colors,  and did some redesign work on it as well. I wanted to keep the chart looking as much like the original as possible but when I was adjusting the colors, the blue background seemed too dull, so that was changed to black...and then, of course, stars had to be added to the galaxy! \nThe captions were initially printed in four languages but it made the chart look overly cluttered, so the reissue features just English and French. The original also had a white banner at the bottom that distracted the eye from the chart, so that was eliminated and the legend moved into a box on the bottom left corner. \nTHE SPACE COLONY POSTER - $12\nOne Space Colony poster. This mid-1970s concept rendering by Rick Guidice shows a proposed design for a NASA space colony. It measures 12\" x 16\" ( 30cm x 40cm ) and will be shipped rolled in a mailing tube. Shipping is $3 within the USA. If you have already selected The Conquest of Space reward, then you can add-on the chart for only $6!\nTHE CONQUEST OF SPACE POSTER - $35\nOne Conquest of Space poster. This is what the project is all about. It measures 26\" x 36\" ( 2.16' x 3'/66cm x 91cm ) and will be shipped rolled in a mailing tube. Shipping is FREE within the USA!\nTHE MAKE 100 - $35 ( Limited to 100 )\nOne Conquest of Space poster....plus the bonus 12x16\" concept poster available only through this Kickstarter campaign! It features a beautiful concept rendering by artist Rick Guidice of a proposed design for a NASA space colony in the mid-1970s. \nTHE CONQUEST OF SPACE X2 - $60\nOne for You, One for a Friend. You'll receive two Conquest of Space posters. You can keep them both for yourself or give one to a friend ( you'll have to give it to them yourself ). Shipping is FREE within the USA!\n\nPERSONNEL REPORT\nMy name is Constance.

NEW OPTION: HIGH ELVEN! VOTE NOW!\nVOTE NOW!\nThe system is pretty simple! Each month, you choose a theme and we create assets that are matching that theme for the Townbuilder, as well as a number of print-ready buildings that you can download immediately.\nIf you back this Kickstarter you will receive a code that will, once redeemed, automatically unlock the release for the current month and all following months for the duration you backed for.\nIf you are supporting any miniature sculptors on Patreon, you will already have an idea how such a system plays out. The only difference is, that you will get buildings and customization assets instead of miniatures, and they will be available on townsmith.de instead of google drive/MyAirBridge/Sync.\nAccess to the Townbuilder Software is not included in the subscription, but also not necessarily needed. Please read the section \"TB not included\" for more information.\n\nBasically, each release is a number of models (Walls, Floors, Doors, Windows, Roofs, etc...) that are fitting the theme of that month and are automatically unlocked for your account as soon as they are available.\nAdditionally, we will create a number of print-ready, support-free buildings, that you can download as a zip file that includes everything you need. You can also customize the buildings with any models of prior releases or our last Kickstarter in the Townbuilder.\nThere are a total of 6 releases planned in this Kickstarter, with more to come if the system is profitable. Depending on your pledge you receive a total of 3 or 6 such releases!\n\nSubscribing after these initial 6 months is optional and you will be asked if you want to stay subscribed when you enter your activation codes.\nWe would love for you to stay subscribed and allow us to expand the Townbuilder each month for a long time, but you can also use this Kickstarter without binding yourself to a subscription and just get the 6 months of assets and buildings.\n\nNow let's talk about our last Kickstarter, Townbuilder Unlimited, which was really successful and allowed us to make the Townbuilder much bigger than we ever anticipated! But as many of you know, that Kickstarter has not yet been completely fulfilled. But as you can see in the delivery dates, there is plenty of time for us to finish the last stretch goals before the first monthly release is due.\nWhat we have learned from our last Kickstarter and from running this company for more than a year now is that the most valuable things out there are information and time. If we know which and how many models and buildings we have to create 4 months before the first release rolls out, it will improve the product quality and lower our stress level significantly.\n\nHere we would like to show you the concept art for the already chosen themes, as well as the options for the later releases.\nPLEASE NOTE THAT THIS IS JUST CONCEPT ART. HOW DETAILED AND VARIED THE 3D MODELS WILL BE DEPENDS ON THE UNLOCKED STRETCH GOALS.\nCheck the \"Monthly Release\" section to see a daily update on how much has been unlocked. \nClick to see more details!\nClick to see more details!\nClick to vote!\nSeptember, October, November: Will be determined after August has been voted\n\nYou can choose in which month you'll start your 3-month subscription. If Draconic, Aztec, or the voted theme in august isn't your thing, you can skip these months and start your subscription with the September release.\n\nI assume that most people who stumble across this Kickstarter are either backers of our last campaign or bought the Townbuilder shortly after on MMF, BackerKit or in our store.\nBut for those of you who are new to Townsmith, here is a quick overview:\nPLAY\n\nWe really can't explain what the Townbuilder is any better than our info page can: Townbuilder Info Page\nTLDR: The Townbuilder is a web-based custom creator for 3D-printable buildings for tabletop games. You can combine small building blocks, such as walls, floors, roofs, and stairs, into complete buildings.\nAh, and of course, if you don't own the Townbuilder yet, you should head over to our store and have a look at it! There are already plenty of models that you can use to create buildings.\nIf you decide to get the Townbuilder, I HIGHLY recommend watching our User Guide Youtube Playlist, it helps a lot with getting started!\n\n\nAbout a year and a half has passed since Tom and I had the idea for the Townbuilder. Initially, it started as a side project next to our university studies.\nWell, we're certainly not at that point anymore. We had a very successful Kickstarter last year and since then the Townbuilder has gone from Open Beta to Early Access 0.1-0.4 and finally to Townbuilder v1.0.\nBut what exactly has improved and changed in the software since you last saw it on Kickstarter?\nImproved Performance\nIncreased Server capacities by a factor of 10\nImplemented under the hood services that allow us to better monitor the performance and problems of the Townbuilder\nImplemented OpenLOCK capabilities\nDeveloped our own peg and magnet system, allowing for 1-6mm magnets and pegs to be placed on almost any model\nCreated a peg placement mode that makes it much more convenient to place pegs\nEnabled scaling of the exported building to a variety of popular scales\nStarted a partner system to get models of other designers into the Townbuilder\nAdded Fillerblocks, a way to fill out empty space or use them as placeholders (cube, cylinder, prism, floor-like)\nAdded a grouping system that gives the user full control over which models are exported as one STL\nAdded a group linking system that expands the grouping functionality to allow for multiple floors to be linked together for export\nAdded Building Blocks, a way of saving and importing whole buildings into your workspace, enabling creative users to fully modularize their building process\nAdded animations to different elements\nReworked the entire GUI making it responsive on smaller and larger monitors.\nCreated the Signbuilder, a sub-application for the Townbuilder, with which you can create signs with custom text and logos that can be used in the Townbuilder\nFixed 500+ bugs\nHad the servers burn down 3 times\nWIP on (semi-)automatic mesh repair using Netfabb so models can be used in all slicers (Simplify3D users rejoice!)\nWIP on a link sharing system, that allows users to share their builds via unique URLs\nWIP on creative mode that allows users to build with all existing assets, save and share the building, but not export it as an STL\nWIP on on-click merchant integration that will allow users to send out print-commission request to our licensed merchants directly from the Townbuilder\n\nWe will also post this in the FAQ, but just to be clear:\nDoes the subscription include access to the software?\nNO, IT DOESN'T. THIS KICKSTARTER IS JUST ABOUT A MONTHLY EXPANSION OF MODELS AND PRINT-READY BUILDINGS!\n\nIf you backed our last Kickstarter, you already got a lifetime license to the Townbuilder.\nThis system will not change and will remain as it is for the foreseeable future. We do not charge you extra, nor do we give new people cheaper options to get the Townbuilder.\n\nYou can back this Kickstarter without owning the Townbuilder and you will still get all the STLs for the buildings. However, you will not be able to customize them unless you backed our last Kickstarter or you specifically backed one of the following reward tiers:\nTownbuilder Advanced + 6 Months Subscription\nTownbuilder Pro + 6 Months Subscription\nTownbuilder All In\n\nWith this Kickstarter, our stretch goals will depend on the number of backers, NOT on the money raised. That is because this number gives us a rough estimate of how many subscribers we will have in any given month.\nSince you can back for just three or for six months, or for a pledge level that includes both the Townbuilder and a subscription, each individual backer will contribute different amounts of money. This means we use the backer number as a rough estimate of our monthly subscriber count, which in return allows us to determine the variety and detail level of a monthly release.\nBelow you can see the different detail levels that can be unlocked on some example buildings from the Draconic and Aztec theme. \nThe roadmap also includes print-ready, support free buildings of all previously created sets. These will be built once, not on a monthly basis, and will be made available to all backers in the same way as the ones from the monthly releases. If you have access to the sets these buildings were built with, you will be able to customize them in the Townbuilder, otherwise, you will only have access to the print-ready version.\n\n\nOur current Merchant License System is really really simple. You pay 35\u20ac per month and you can sell as many prints of Townbuilder buildings as you want.\nThis does include all the print-ready buildings that we will create with this Kickstarter.\nFor more information, check out our License Agreement.\nIf you want to become a Townbuilder Merchant, check out our store!\n\nAs you may know, we have opened the Townbuilder up to external content. This means that we implement models by other creators as well as our users into the Townbuilder.\nIf you want to know more about this, and want to suggest a creator to us, or get your models into the Townbuilder, send us a message via partners@townsmith.de.\n\nWe are Townsmith. This sentence meant a lot to us when we launched our very first Kickstarter over a year ago. And it only continued to grow in meaning when the Kickstarter exploded beyond all expectations on the second attempt. Since then, our team has grown, and so has the responsibility of all of us.\nWe are very happy to say that we still have the same spirit that originally brought us to this.\nWe are just a group of nerds who love DnD and 3D printing and creating cool tools for our hobby!\n\n\nIf you want to get in touch with us, the best way is via Discord. We have a very active server with over 1800 users. Feel free to join our community, we are always happy to help you out!\nWe also post regular updates on Instagram and Facebook.\nAnd then, of course, you should subscribe to our Youtube Channel if you want to get notified whenever we make more user guides.\nIf you have business-inquiries or want to talk about collaborations in general, please send us an email at business@townsmith.de\nIf you are interested in becoming a partner and getting your models in the Townbuilder, please contact us via partners@townsmith.de", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have now almost fulfilled one of the biggest digital Kickstarters in the 3D printing scene.\nWe have gone through the insane challenge of getting a company of 10 people up and running. And it has been running cleanly for about 4 months now (Our initial Kickstarter launched 7 months ago).\n\nWe have a team of 5 artists and 1 technician working on getting hundreds of models in the Townbuilder and Tom and I are always available to fix any technical issues that might come up.\nAnd we are ready to expand our team if we reach higher stretch goals and the funding is there. If this system makes 50k a month, rest assured that most of it will directly influence the amount and quality of the models we make, while the rest will go into research and development for the next builder. Wait did I just spoil that we are coding another custom builder? No one reads this section anyway, won't do any harm. For the few of you that do keep posted and look for some green in the wild of our website, you might find some hints soon ;)\n\nStill, there are some risks we simply cannot account for:\nA) Longevity. We survived the 'valley of death', that destroys so many start-ups. However, we still cannot guarantee how long the service will live. This Kickstarter is meant to provide us much more safe planning for the next 6 months, but who knows how much money we will make with this system afterward. And if it doesn't pay for the artists, we will not be able to continue the subscriptions.\n\nB) Times of uncertainty. We all know that 2020 just ended, and it taught us, that it can always get worse. So if the world collapses into an economic crisis, a war breaks out or half of our team dies, we will simply not be able to recover. Stuff like this will cause this project to fail since we just don't have millions on the side or 200 employees.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nSustainable Distribution\nPure Digital Shipping", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u20ac40 or more", "title": "3 Monthly Releases", "descp": "10% saved versus a monthly subscription after the Kickstarter\nWith this reward, you will get an activation code which will begin a free 3-month subscription for our Townbuilder SubSystem.\nThis means you will get access to 3 monthly model releases\n(check the campaign description to see what 1 release includes as this is expanded over the course of the campaign)\nINCLUDES:\n3\u00d7 monthly releases\nVote for the themes starting in August", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2021"}], "stat": ["26 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac60 or more", "title": "6 Monthly Releases", "descp": "33% saved versus a monthly subscription after the Kickstarter\nWith this reward, you will get an activation code which will begin a free 6-month subscription for our Townbuilder SubSystem.\nYou can activate this code at any time, so feel free to skip the months that don't interest you!\nThis means you will get access to 6 monthly releases\n(check the campaign description to see what 1 release includes as this is expanded over the course of the campaign)\nINCLUDES:\n6\u00d7 monthly releases\nVote for the themes starting in August", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2021"}], "stat": ["188 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac80 or more", "title": "Townbuilder Advanced+6 Monthly Releases", "descp": "ONLY BACK IF YOU DID NOT SUPPORT OUR LAST KICKSTARTER AND NEED A TOWNBUILDER EDITION, NOT JUST MODELS!!!\nFor more information on what the Advanced Edition and the Medieval Set are, please check the campaign description!\nINCLUDES:\nTownbuilder Advanced Edition\n6\u00d7 monthly releases\nMedieval Set\nVote for the themes starting in August", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2021"}], "stat": ["12 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac100 or more", "title": "Townbuilder Pro+6 Monthly Releases", "descp": "ONLY BACK IF YOU DID NOT SUPPORT OUR LAST KICKSTARTER AND NEED A TOWNBUILDER EDITION, NOT JUST MODELS!!!\nFor more information on what the Pro Edition and the Medieval Set are, please check the campaign description!\nINCLUDES:\nTownbuilder Pro Edition\n6\u00d7 monthly releases\nMedieval Set\nVote for the themes starting in August", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2021"}], "stat": ["7 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac200 or more", "title": "Townbuilder All In", "descp": "ONLY BACK IF YOU DID NOT SUPPORT OUR LAST KICKSTARTER AND WANT EVERYTHING FROM THERE AS WELL!!!\nYou will get a total value of 291\u20ac at 31% off for only 200\u20ac.

It has since appeared in store shelves in a shortened form courtesy of independent publishing company Antarctic Press.\nWhen we last left off in Volume 2, the Kamen Corps was squaring away with the triple threat of Machiavellian agent Niro Lansky, the mud-manipulating Vermillion Masquerade, and the arrogant, armored Kamen U.N.

If you told people from the Middle Ages or Ancient Egypt about a telephone, a car, or electricity, they would take you for a deity or a superhero. But do you actually know how these things work?\nAs a child, before bed, I used to imagine with my dad what things like bowstrings would be made of in ancient times. In the morning, looking it up, we would be startled to discover that bowstrings were made of veins and if you wanted instead to make one from gunpowder ingredients you had to urinate on hay!\n\nAs I got older, I got into mechanics and discovered that many apparently simple things are based on brilliant ideas. All the discoveries and inventions that seemed incredible and almost magical when I was a child actually were just as fantastical as I imagined!\n\nI realized that most people knew very little about how such inventions of our civilization as a plow, a mill, a blast furnace or glass are made and how they work. I began making a list of the most amazing inventions I would like to tell my children about. Later I added illustrations, which became more and more bizarre and mysterious. After some time, I finished a draft of The Book of Incredible Inventions and Discoveries. \n\nNow I want to share this book with everyone who hasn\u2019t lost their juvenile curiosity and love for mystery. If you are as fascinated by technical, military, medical and artistic inventions as I am, you definitely will love The Book of Incredible Inventions and Discoveries and The Ultimate Guide to Rebuilding a Civilization. This book is an illustrated encyclopedia of mechanisms, processes and materials that have played a significant role in human history.\nThere is no other book like this. Currently, information about inventions is scattered here and there in boring textbooks and manuals that are neither understandable nor inspiring. The Book of Incredible Inventions and Discoveries presents the most meaningful facts about our culture combined with out-of-this-world ideas and fabulous illustrations. It is the first treatise of its kind on these spectacular magical inventions. Only with your help will we  be able to create this exceptional book.\nVsevolod  Co-founder of The Book\n\nThe Book is a unique artifact similar to the most mysterious and mantic books of humankind. The visual symbolism of the book connects it to the prominent fifteen-century Voynich manuscript while its uncommon and original ideas are similar to the Summa Technologiae of Stanis\u0142aw Lem. The book is also influenced by the aesthetics of the renowned Codex Seraphinianus. The Ultimate Guide is a real masterpiece and an endless source of inspiration.\n\nOn the pages of The Ultimate Guide you will find visual instructions for making handy mechanisms and materials in case you lose them or forget. With over 400 pages of detailed and catchy illustrations, you will forget about everything and bury yourself in the book. You won\u2019t stop thinking of what you saw.\nThis section is all about how to be healthy, cheerful, and fresh. Here you\u2019ll find out how to give mouth-to-mouth resuscitation without getting punched in the nose. You\u2019ll learn how to remove your appendix if you don\u2019t need it anymore. We\u2019ll tell you which mushrooms are tasty and which mushrooms are fun (what are mushrooms and what are shrooms). We\u2019ll teach you yoga and Chinese needle therapy. Believe us, all of this knowledge will come in handy in the ruins of the post-apocalyptic world! (not to mention in the modern world, given the cost of medical insurance). We\u2019ll also explain how to make gypsum, glue, penicillin or even all three together from scratch.\nThe whole world is a big chemistry lab and the only limit here is your lack of knowledge. If there\u2019s sand under your feet, you can make glass. If you see trees around you, it\u2019s a step from there to making paper. The magic of our civilization, which is electricity, can also be made from easily accessible materials. There are tons of ways to make it and we\u2019ll reveal the most original one.\nResearchers have concluded that human brain development was always influenced by laziness and greed. We want to have as much as possible with minimal effort and that\u2019s what makes us geniuses. Mills and water pumps will do the work for you. The combustion engine will help you in traveling any distance. Cameras made of boxes and paper with photosensitive surfaces will immortalize your successes\nIn all the worlds of the Multiverse in which this book will be published, we\u2019ve agreed that killing people isn\u2019t cool. We wish these inventions never appeared, but still\u2026.The trebuchet is pretty darn good. To create saltpeter, which is the main gunpowder component, all it takes is hay and human urine. How long will you have to pee in the pit full of hay? You\u2019ll find this out in The Ultimate Guide. By the way, did you know that the alchemist who discovered gunpowder thought he was creating the elixir of life? Well, if you throw pots full of gunpowder at your enemies, you\u2019ll become immortal (for a while).\nThe home of ancient man began from fire, so if you don\u2019t want to be dumber than your ancestors you need to learn how to use flint and steel. If all goes smoothly, you\u2019ll be able to build a log house, weave a rug, mould houseware out of clay and build a boat. You\u2019ll learn the art of tying knots and using natural dyes. But above all, you\u2019ll learn how to construct a unique top-class mousetrap, so rodents won\u2019t have any chance. (Failing to do that, read about cat domestication in the Farming section.)\n\nIt\u2019s said that wheat domesticated humans rather than the opposite. Agriculture made us who we are today, so in this book you\u2019ll find a detailed description of grain types and animal farming principles. You\u2019ll learn to make fishing nets, help to deliver calves, procure salt and honey. But first you should learn to brew the best-ever wheat beer. (Which will literally be the best beer in the world since you\u2019ll be the only brewer after the fall of civilization)\nLife is not only about surviving; it\u2019s also about not dying of boredom. There will be fewer fights in your survivor camp if you give people cards and chess. Your children won\u2019t set fire to your house (built thanks to the instructions of the Hearth and Home section) because they will be playing ball or flying a kite. You\u2019ll become a local movie mogul if you make a phenakistiscope, a device that creates the illusion of motion. By the way! We\u2019ll tell you how to make a vibrator.\n\n\nThere is nothing similar to the sound of the Australian didg. It\u2019s literally the voice of spirits. This musical instrument exists in all the worlds of the Multiverse, so make sure to read a manual on how to make it. The same applies to the jaw harp, which can be found in the history of any nation on the earth and beyond. During your interworld journey a sitar and a bell will come in handy too. Tell whomever you meet about the music theory of our world and don\u2019t forget to ask about their notation too. \n\nRituals, traditions, and etiquette are as significant as mechanisms and materials. The most basic and peculiar inventions of human communication were collected in The Ultimate Guide. How do you tie a tie to make a good impression? What is the philosophy behind fashion? What are the rules of setting a table and marking the road? How exactly do you carry out seppuku in the way that will most impress others?\nA Dutch philosopher Johan Huizinga in his book Homo Ludens proved that games appeared long before culture. People enjoyed games and invented a gillion of different games in the ensuing thousand years. Many games also keep arcane knowledge. For example, card suits depict archetypes of the human psyche, chessmen talk about the social organization and hierarchy. You\u2019ll be able to rule the whole world if you know how the main games of humanity, such as football or Monopoly, work and what rules they have.\n\nPeople had not yet invented writing when they discovered that fried meat was much better than raw and that fermented fruit juice dissipated sorrow and made them sleep like a baby. Over time, cooking has become a real art that requires imagination and ingenuity. Asians held raw fish in a pressing machine for weeks to make sushi. Arab nomads occasionally discovered cheese recipe by keeping milk in bags made of sheep\u2019s stomachs. And don\u2019t forget to learn the recipe of the main food invention, which is bread. Without bread you won\u2019t be able to make your new world fully civilized. \nThe intriguing illustrations that combine engineering drawings and medieval art depict the structure of devices and materials in many forms throughout the many worlds of the Multiverse. What does it mean? According to The Ultimate Guide, people find new ideas in the world\u2019s information realm rather than come up with new ones. This means that development of these ideas isn\u2019t connected to anything really. They can appear out of the blue in different worlds of the Multiverse.\nIn one of these worlds, medieval peasants work fields with tills attached to bicycles. In another world, gladiators of the Colosseum fight under stadium lights. There is a world where indium-gallium alloys are the essence of microelectronics instead of silicon. In one more world zeppelin became the main means of transport when humanity discovered a cheap way to produce helium as opposed to explosive hydrogen. On the pages of The Book of Incredible Inventions and Discoveries you\u2019ll find tons of such examples and probably will think that similar ideas have come to your mind before.\nIt is made for satisfying curiosity, widening the horizons of your mind, drawing inspiration and teleporting from world to world.\nThis book will make an excellent gift for all those who are keen on art, technology, history and such puzzling sciences as semiotics and hermeneutics.\nIt is made for satisfying curiosity, widening the horizones of your mind, drawing inspiration and teleporting from world to world.

All the pages of the book will be printed on special thick 157gsm paper. This is a high-quality mat art paper, which definitely feels well and holds well. The Ultimate Guide will be a hardcover book and will have stunning matt laminated cover.\nThe Ultimate Guide contains knowledge of humankind and it can\u2019t come to life without the help of people. We need the support of enthusiasts who believe in the unique future of the human mind.\n                                                   In the first place, the raised money will go to the illustrators because The Book of Incredible Inventions and Discoveries forms a collection of great detailed pictures. The budget also includes the work of content editors and the book\u2019s printing.\nPLAY\n\nThe Book project is promoted by REPROJECT.\n\n\nFB agencies:\nThis project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 1,100+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $460M raised between them.\n\"More than $50,000,000 has been raised with Sprint's support\"\nThis campaign is promoted by Backercamp.

Escape from the pessimism and propaganda of modern fiction, and take a journey through a mythic America that might have been.\nIn PIRATES OF THE ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVES, twelve-year-old Philo starts a pirate radio station with his friends in the mountains of Virginia, and learns that the world is a stranger place than he ever imagined. The Ancient Marauder, the Bright and Terrible Birds, the Mishipeshu, and other creatures of myth and legend populate this enchanting mixture of science and fantasy.\nIn FIVE MILLION WATTS, Philo takes a job at the most powerful radio station in the world, meets a mysterious old man who claims to be a Neolithic god, and learns the story of a genius inventor who built an experimental transmitter to communicate with aetheric life forms.\nIn THE TOWER OF THE BEAR, Philo travels from the bottom of the Arctic Ocean, to the forbidden lands west of the Mississippi, to the shores of a prehistoric inland sea, enlisting the aid of scientists, kings, ancient gods, and mythological beasts, in a search for a super-metal from another universe.\nIn THE CITY OF ILLUSIONS, Philo battles prehistoric sea monsters, meets the Bear who guards the hub of the universe, journeys into ancestral memories to confront the Ancient Marauder, travels a mythic river in a dugout canoe, crosses the last of all deserts and learns the fate of the Tyrant, befriends a cybernetic teddy bear with strange abilities, escapes from the clutches of the Bone Demon and the Electrical People, and infiltrates a futuristic amusement park in search of the legendary Bullet Train.\nIn THE EARTH A MACHINE TO SPEAK, Philo builds an impossible transmitter on the shores of the Arctic Ocean, learns the truth about a mythical subterranean race, and discovers a mysterious neutron star on the edge of the Solar System, bringing his epic journey to a spectacular conclusion.\nThis odd, quirky, fun, and wildly imaginative series has gotten rave reviews from indy SF authors and readers. \n\"Pirates of the Electromagnetic Waves is an amazing young adult techno-adventure reminiscent of Bertrand R. Brinley\u2019s classic Mad Scientists Club. Set in an alternate universe nostalgically reminiscent of mid-century America, Wood tells the story of a boy and his young friends as they struggle to build and operate a radio station. I highly recommend this book, and I look forward to more Yankee Republic tales.\" - Hans G. Schantz, The Hidden Truth, scientific advisor for the Yankee Republic series\n\"Fenton Wood\u2019s debut novel does so many things right that it\u2019s hard to knowing where to start a proper review.  The basic plot... is actually a narrative device, a central structure on which Woods hangs all sorts of interludes and vignettes that run the gamut from frontier ghost stories, to Old Country goblin tales, to cloak and dagger games of cat and mouse, to diamond hard sci-fi, and along the way, each little morsel provides a broader glimpse into the wider world of a world that might be a long time after the apocalypse, might be a fairy-tale inversion of our world, or might be its own thing altogether.\" - Jon Mollison, Barbarian Emperor, Neon Harvest\n\"This is an utterly charming short novel which, on the surface, reads like a young adult adventure from the golden age, along the lines of the original Tom Swift or Hardy Boys series. But as you get deeper into the story, you discover clues there is much more going on than you first suspected, and that this may be the beginning of a wonderful exploration of an alternative reality which is a delight to visit and you may wish were your home.\" - John Walker, co-founder of Autodesk, Inc.\n\"This is the kind of book that having read it makes you feel like you have a fun, exciting secret, and saying too much would give it away and spoil it for those who follow after.\" - Neovictorian, Sanity\n\"Zowie, what a read! I thoroughly enjoyed Fenton Wood's Pirates of the Electromagnetic waves and I CAN'T WAIT for the sequel. This is the sort of book I've always wanted but didn't imagine could exist.
