Keep them out of sight but easily accessible whenever you need a quick refresher or to jot down notes.\n\nYour Work Essentials Organised\nWith a dedicated space for stationery and small accessories in the toolbar, you\u2019ll always have quick access to your work essentials, whenever you need them.\n\nCables Kept in Place\nThe magnetic cable holder can be moved anywhere along the toolbar to keep your cable in place and always within reach. No more tangles or cables falling off the table!\n\n Stylish and Functional Work Surface\nThe soft and elegant vegan leather will transform any desk into a warm and comfortable workspace, providing a smooth surface to write on and to use your mouse with ease \u2013 suitable for both right and left-handed users.\nFeel professional, confident, and in control with a simple addition that can make a huge difference.\n\nMade to Last \nThe Orbitkey Desk Mat protects your desk from scratches, stains and spills.

Add additional cable holders to manage multiple cables.\nDesign Process\nWe always try to be conscious of what we\u2019re designing \u2013 focusing less on the quantity, and more on the quality of a small, but considered selection of products. Our hearts, minds and even weekends were poured into this new product, and here\u2019s a small lookbook to give you an idea of how we went about designing the Orbitkey Desk Mat.\n About Orbitkey \nWe believe in clever organisation for better living.\nSince 2013, we've launched 4 crowdfunding campaigns, with over 33,000 backers, raising over USD 2 million.\nWe love Kickstarter. Not only did you help bring Orbitkey to life, you also allow us to focus on making great products and keep doing the things we love \u2013 without the influence of outside investors.\nWe are a team of 21 passionate individuals based in Melbourne, Australia \u2013 driven by design, innovation and clever organisation. This new project is the result of continuous feedback and hard work over the past few months. We hope to have you join us on our journey towards better living.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have a pretty good track record with our previous 4 campaigns \u2013 with most rewards being shipped on time or with a 1-month delay at most. Our previous campaigns have also given us valuable experience in all aspects of bringing a product to life and running a crowdfunding campaign.\n\nIt has better prepared us in the challenges associated with tooling, production, logistics, communication, and delivering a high-quality product.\n\nHowever, there are always challenges and unforeseen obstacles that arise when trying to bring a product to life.\n\nIn the case of encountering unavoidable obstacles, we have always handled them swiftly and efficiently, and have always conducted things in the best interest of our backers and Orbitkey family. We always keep our backers updated with complete transparency.\n\nWe will do our very best to ensure we deliver what we promise and to go the extra mile whenever possible.

Our products are designed with the best materials and built to last \u2013 tested thoroughly to withstand heavy use. We love that we're still seeing plenty of backers from our first Kickstarter campaign in 2013 still using the rewards they received then.\nReusability and recyclability\nOur products are designed to last. However, should you encounter any problems with any of the parts, you can let us know and we'll be able to send you a specific replacement part.\nSustainable materials\nThe base of the Desk Mat is made of 100% recycled PET felt. On top of that, all our packaging material is plastic-free and 100% recyclable.\nEnvironmentally friendly factories\nAll our factories have been carefully selected and are partners we've been working with for several years. We have team members on the ground who visit the factories on a regular basis to ensure quality, ethical and environmental standards are upheld.\nSustainable Distribution\nWe plan to optimise our shipping routes by utilising sea freight to transport bulk quantities to local warehouses to reduce the carbon footprint of our delivery plan.\nSomething else\nLike Kickstarter, we've already committed to offset our carbon footprint in 2020.

Production version will be 4\" x 6\"\nThere are many different definitions for the acronym \"EDC\", but in this project we mean \"every day carry,\" a collection of useful items that are consistently carried on person every day. The main reasons for having EDC are utility and preparedness; to help individuals overcome simple everyday problems, and to prepare someone for unexpected and possibly dangerous situations. (Source: Wikipedia)\nExample of every-day carry items.\nDuring our search for an organizer to carry our own EDC products, we've learned that there are a lot of great organizers out there. However, there were two problems we encountered:\n1) There wasn't an organizer small enough to carry a lighter load that also gave us the ability to expand to carry larger items when we needed to.\n2) We found that a lot of organizers featured similar, limited strap configurations on both sides of their inner compartments. We wanted more strap versatility.\nThis is what led us to design our own.\nWhether you\u2019re a daily commuter, emergency responder, avid traveler, or work-from-home EDC enthusiast staying organized is important to be truly prepared for anything; especially when it comes to keeping those small or large every day carry items close at hand.\n Compression & Expansion Zipper \nEDC organizers come in various sizes and capacities but ours is one size with dual capacity. So what we did was we took the expansion zipper feature from our ZIP Travel Waist Pack project 3 years ago, and put it into the organizer...\nThis extra zipper is designed solely for expanding or collapsing the overall depth of the bag to give you more or less space for storing items. This helps you add larger things such as bandages and medicine bottles, or to save space when you\u2019re traveling or packing light.\nGRID-STYLE STRAPS\nElastic grid-style straps isn't new to the storage industry, however to the best of our knowledge, they have never been used inside of a zippered EDC organizer until now...\nExample of every-day carry items inside the organizer.\nOur multipurpose EDC organizer provides you with plenty of storage straps for storing and securing all the little things you\u2019ll need to provide emergency repairs, keep your tech device cables organized, or simply be better prepared for any camping or survival activities.\nRugged Materials\nWe know that you might use this all-purpose EDC carry bag for some pretty serious outdoor or emergency response needs which is why it has high tear and puncture resistance and designed with reinforced zippers and pulls.\nMultiple Carry Options\nWe\u2019ve added a small handle at the top of the bag for some quick grab-and-go use as well as two long MOLLE compatible snaps that let you attach it to larger backpack or bag so you don\u2019t misplace it or leave it behind. \nMorale Patches\nOn the outside of our rugged EDC organizer pouch you\u2019ll find a Velcro (hook & loop) patch area that will let you attach one of your favorite patches such as a country flag, military unit, military branch, red cross, or a patch from the best TV show ever!\nWater-Resistant Fabric\nMade with water-resistant 500D fabric to help keep your gear drier on the inside when you\u2019re traveling, working outside, or stuck working in a bit of inclement weather like rain or snow.\nPlease Note: The organizer is NOT waterproof and does not float on water.\nYKK Zippers and Pulls\nEach EDC organizer features thick pulls attached to the zipper base with reinforced silicone wrapped around them for added strength and pull resilience.\nVERSATILITY\nOur organizer allows a wider range of emergency response or outdoor travel gear while also adding a sleek, trendy look that matches its toughness. \nExample of tools inside the organizer.\n Weight: 8 ounces\nWe went through several different design options. Here are the most recent illustrations showing the first and second styles which ultimately led to the final design.\nPlease note that you are pledging on the EDC Organizer ONLY. Every-day carry items (e.g. Apple AirPods, pocket knives, flashlights, tools, velcro patches, etc.) that are shown in the photos, videos, and animations are for educational purposes only.\nAfter the campaign, all backers will provide shipping information and confirm pledge rewards through BackerKit, where we will offer the opportunity to purchase additional EDC Organizers, ZEROHOUR products, and other accessories (ADD-ONS) to ship together with your reward. Instructions will be provided at the end of the campaign in a backer update.\nFirst Aid Survival Kit\nWe understand that putting together a First Aid Survival Kit by purchasing items one-by-one yourself can be tedious. So to make things easier, we've teamed up with a manufacturing partner and put together an awesome package for you. The First Aid Survival Kit ADD-ON will include the following items: \n25 products totaling 240 pieces will make setting up your organizer a breeze. Available as a BackerKit ADD-ON!\nInternational Backers:\nPlease check with your country's knife import laws before purchasing the First Aid Survival Kit ADD-ON. The knife specifications are as follows: It is a folding knife that has a flipper tab for one-hand operation, there is a liner-lock that keeps the blade locked when opened, and the blade's total length is 3.25 inches / 8.25 cm.\nIn the event that the knife is not allowed in your country, you will have the option to purchase the ADD-ON without the pocket knife. \nExample of a First Aid Survival Kit setup.\nBonus:\nWe are also including a RED CROSS on a black background patch (not to be confused with the ICRC red cross that is on a white background) for your EDC Organizer if you purchase the First Aid Survival Kit ADD-ON. The patch by itself will also be available as an ADD-ON.\nFor USA backers; single organizer rewards we will ship via USPS First Class Mail (5-7 Business Days), two or more organizers will typically ship via USPS Priority Mail (2-3 Business Days). For international backers; we are going to be using USPS ePacket which varies between 10 - 21 Business Days. As of July 1st, 2020 ePacket is ONLY available in these countries:\nAustralia\nBelgium\nCanada\nCroatia\nDenmark\nEstonia\nFrance\nGermany\nGibraltar\nHong Kong\nIreland\nIsrael\nJapan\nLithuania\nLuxembourg\nNetherlands\nNew Zealand\nPoland\nPortugal\nSingapore\nSouth Korea\nSweden\nUnited Kingdom\nIf your country is not listed above (or if your country is listed but you want your package to arrive faster), you can still pledge and we will ship it by USPS International First Class Mail but we HIGHLY recommend that you consider upgrading to FedEx Priority Mail (3 to 5 Business Days; Guaranteed Service) otherwise your package may be at risk for getting lost or stolen. FedEx will be available as an ADD-ON on BackerKit at the end of the campaign. \nWith the support of our backers, we've raised over $1,000,000 on Kickstarter to create ZEROHOUR products, which have been featured on The Today Show, CNet, Yahoo! Tech, and Discovery Science Channel. Backers, media, and consumers support us because we know how to reinvent products, and we stand by our work with limited lifetime warranties.\nThank you for your support as we welcome the EDC Organizer to the ZEROHOUR family!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOur team has managed fourteen prior Kickstarter campaigns from start to finished product.

Our patented air filtration system uses industrial grade, replaceable filters, blocking 99.9% of air particles. \nATMOBLUE's unparalleled breathing experience utilizes many of the cutting edge technologies found in high-end purifiers today but offers the added benefits of mobility, style and comfort. With excess air being produced on-demand, users of ATMOBLUE always have access to fresh, filtered air.\n\nOUR STORY\nIn 2016, while living abroad, the creators of ATMOBLUE experienced hazardous air levels for the first time. While various masks on the market offered protection from larger particles such as sand and pollen, very few masks effectively filtered smaller particles such as bacteria and PM2.5. This was how the idea to create a wearable, air purification system came to mind.\nAfter months of research and development, the team created ATMOBLUE, launching an initial prototype in Asia. The feedback was incredible. ATMOBLUE received rave reviews, publications and awards. Today, building on top of their initial success and prototype, the team behind ATMOBLUE is ready to introduce a new and improved version to the world!\nSignificant upgrades have been made to ATMOBLUE including new and improved batteries, in-built mask controls, upgraded long-lasting HEPA filters (150 hours of use time), as well as a newly designed and patented head strap. In addition to these upgrades, ATMOBLUE has been updated to fit within FCC and UL standards and is currently undergoing certification reviews for US and global sales. ATMOBLUE is currently RoHS, SRCC and QCQ, certified. By funding this campaign, you will be first in line for ATMOBLUE.\nAt this time, you may only purchase ATMOBLUE via Kickstarter so please avoid third party websites and sales links as they are either old or fraudulent. Unfortunately this is quite common with successful campaigns.\nFor additional questions or investment and distribution inquiries feel free to contact us at support@atmoblue.com or directly via Kickstarter messenger. \nWe look forward to this journey and can\u2019t wait to get ATMOBLUE into your hands! \n\nFEATURES:\nReplaceable Industrial Grade H13 HEPA Filters\nBlocks 99.97% of air particulates \nAverage use time is 150 hours\nHigh Quality, Multi-Fold design\nTraditional filters are flat and are quickly consumed. Our unique filters are made of up meticulous folds, compressing the flat surface area of two 9.5 squared inch sheets, into two compact filter blocks which slide right into your mask\nN95 < N99 < H13 HEPA Filters\nYou may have heard the term N95. This simply means 95% of air particles are being captured. At the higher end of the spectrum, N99 (99%) masks are offered for more industrial applications such as painting or waste cleanup. Moving one step further ATMOBLUE's, H13 HEPA filters block 99.97% of particles which are 0.3 microns in diameter or larger. To give you a bit of context, one strand of human hair is about 75 microns across!\nIf used properly ATMOBLUE can reduce the amount of toxic air you breath in by up to 99.9%. ATMOBLUE cannot diagnose, cure, treat, or prevent any illness or condition related to the inhalation of toxic air, bacteria, viruses, smoke or fine air particulates.\nFollow link to learn more about HEPA technology: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HEPA\n\n\n\nInnovative Air Flow Technology\nDual, high-speed, centrifugal fans continuously supply filtered air to create a refreshing breathing environment.\nThree airflow control settings. Users adjust speeds as needed\nPositive Air Pressure allows users to breath effortlessly with zero resistance.\nThe term positive airflow means excess air or \u201cpositive air\u201d being pushed into the mask and out through its vents. Because of this solution positive air pushes out exhaled air increasing the overall effectiveness of the mask by removing unwanted bacteria from the breathing zone. \nDesigned for the most extreme conditions ATMOBLUE\u2019s multiple airflow settings allow users to switch between light mode, when sitting idle on the train or a car, to high strength when jogging through the city or on the job.\nDepending on your use, such as fan speed, your rechargeable ATMOBLUE system runs continuously from 3 \u2013 5 hours. When battery life is running low a red indication light notifies users when to recharge. Simply plug into any USB port until your indicator light turns white again. \n\n\nLightweight silicone seal\nDermatologically friendly silicone creates a soft but airtight seal keeping good air in and bad air out. ATOMBLUE wont leave marks on your face after each use and can be worn with glasses without fogging up vision.\nATMOBLUE\u2019s fresh air system combined with our unique silicon solution give users a truly enjoyable breathing experience. That means, no nasty scent or moist fabric touching your face.\nDesigned to fits various face sizes.\nOur unique silicon seal was designed with users in mind. We compiled data of over 1000 individuals faces and created a unique solution which adapts to various sized faces. ATMOBLUE's soft, lightweight silicone seal contours around users faces leaving enough room for movement and flexibility. \n\nPatented head strap design for maximum range and comfort\nOur patented head strap system allows users to move about comfortably in any direction. If you\u2019ve ever worn a mask you know how frustrating head straps can be as they cause unnecessary pressure behind your ears or simply fall off your head when moving around.\nWith our unique strap-channel design, the continuous head-strap flows through the mask, around your neck and head, creating a full range of continuous motion.\nDesigned with athletes in mind we used high-quality,  flexible, materials allowing for a stretch when using your mobile device or looking around your periphery. ATMOBLUE\u2019s strap system in combination with our soft silicone seal allows for a tight, secure fit with superior comfort and style. \n\n\nCompact design & Interchangeable skins\nShowcase your unique style with ATMOBLUE's modular skin system. Available in four color configurations: Smoke, Pearl, Cement Grey, and Light Pink\nReplaceable covers allow your mask to transform and adapt to your style and environment. Simply remove the magnetic HEPA caps and pop off the front of the mask. Once you\u2019ve chosen one your ideal color skin, simply attach and go.\nDesigned to be worn around your neck when not in use or in your carrying bag, ATMOBLUE\u2019s compact design features a lightweight design of only 190 grams.\n\nAPP control (Unlocked with Stretch goal)\nAs an added bonus, all ATMOBLUE units come standard with built-in software & APP control. The device management APP provides real air-time quality indicators, tracks personal metrics and most importantly offers dynamic air flow controls.\nOur patented i02 air control algorithm allows users airflow to automatically adjust according to their activity. If the user suddenly picks up speed, say while working or exercising, the APP automatically increases fan speed, reducing breathing resistance and offering more fresh air on demand. Over time we plan to release new updates to the mask for extended capabilities.\nPLAY\n\nThe ATMOBLUE App in action! \nWith the ATMOBLUE app users can interact with their mask, confirm filter life, personalize airflow settings or simply check the air quality index in their area.\nSTRETCH GOALS\nOnce the following Stretch Goals are met we will be unlocking the following upgrades for free!

This new project is the result of continuous feedback and hard work for the past few years. We hope to have you join us on our journey towards better living.\nWe always try to be conscious of what we\u2019re designing. To focus less on the quantity, and instead focus more on the quality of the small, but considered selection of products. Our hearts, minds and even weekends were poured into this new product, and here\u2019s a small lookbook to give you an idea of how we went about designing Orbitkey Nest.\nApart from being a beautifully designed product, we\u2019ve ensured that Orbitkey Nest is crafted from premium materials and will withstand everyday use. We\u2019ve conducted rigorous testing that demonstrate the durability of Nest: \nExternal Fabric Abrasion Testing\nElastic Loop Durability Testing\nElastic Loop Abrasion Testing", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are always challenges and unforeseen obstacles that arise when trying to bring a product to life. However, this will be Orbitkey\u2019s 4th Kickstarter campaign, and the previous campaigns have given us valuable experience in all aspects of bringing a product to life and running a crowdfunding campaign. \n\nIt has better prepared us in the challenges associated with tooling, production, logistics, communication and delivering a high-quality product.\n\nIn the case of encountering unavoidable obstacles, we have always handled them swiftly and efficiently, and have always conducted things in the best interest of our backers and Orbitkey family. We always keep our backers updated and with complete transparency.\n\nWe will do our very best to ensure we deliver what we promise and to go the extra mile whenever possible.

They are designed with the best materials and built to last \u2013 and tested thoroughly to withstand heavy use. We love that we're still seeing plenty of backers from our first Kickstarter campaign in 2013 still using the rewards they received on Kickstarter.\nReusability and recyclability\nOur products are designed to last. However, should you encounter any problems with any of the parts, you can let us know and we'll be able to send you a specific replacement part.

Click the image below:\nWhat is The Draft Top tool?\nExplosion not guaranteed\nThe Draft Top tool is a patent pending bar tool designed to remove the top of almost any can.  \nThe result is a topless can that enhances your drinking experience and allows you to do things with the can that you never thought you could.\n Not to mention the innovative design safely removes the top leaving no sharp edges. \nThe Draft Top can be used on most 8-19 oz beverage cans. \nAre you a beer drinker? \nGood news, the Draft Top tool works on Domestic, Imported, and Craft Beers\nDon\u2019t drink beer, no problem!\n The Draft Top tool also works on Spiked Seltzers, Canned Wine, Canned Cocktails, Energy Drinks, Iced Coffee, Soda/Seltzer, and much more.\nWhy Drink Topless?\nThere are many reasons why you should Drink Topless, but here are just a few.\n A smooth pour\nRemoving the top allows for an uninterrupted pour. Leaving you less full and ready to grab another. Ditch the glass and drink straight from the can.\nImagine the mugs as your stomach....\nEnjoy the full taste \nBy removing the entire top, the Draft Top tool allows your nose to enjoy the aroma of your beverage instead of the aluminum top. Enhancing the flavor and allowing you to enjoy it as if it were a glass.\nYou have to be classy when drinking wine in a can\nGarnish your drinks\nSpicing up your favorite canned drinks is even easier when you Drink Topless. Whether you like cocktails or just a little citrus in your beer, we've got you un-covered.\nSend It\n By opening the entire top, the Draft Top tool allows you to drink from the can even faster. Great for showing off your skills to your friends or for das bootsrennen.\nBe like Jesse and Drink Topless\nGetting Creative\n Topless cans are perfect for those right-brained individuals who want to get their craft on.\nThey are also perfect for those who just want to play drinking games such as beer pong or beer die.\nPing pong balls sold separately\nThis was not our first try...\nHow to Use the Draft Top\nDrinking Topless only takes 4 simple steps.\n1. Grab top edge of can\nOr bottom edge of can\nDon't grab the center of the can! \n2. Open Handle and place tool on the top of the can\n3. Squeeze handle and rotate\n4. Align rim with handle notches and slowly rock to open the top\n\nHow Does it Work?\n When the handle is squeezed, it forces the center gear to rotate causing each of the four splitters to synchronously extend towards the rim of the can allowing the Draft Top tool to open a variety of can sizes. \nWatch the Draft Top bar tool opening different sized cans (CAD model shown)\nDurable Design\nThe tool is made of high impact ABS plastic allowing it to withstand the wear and tear of every day life such as:\nA night in a cooler\nAn accidental encounter with your car... We're just trying to prove a point, there's no need to celebrate it Frank!\nEngineered for Performance\nThe splitters are designed to be safe to the touch and last for hundreds of cans and likely more.\nSmall enough to take on the go\nThe Draft Top is about the size of most smartphones and can easily fit into your pocket.\nThe Draft Top tool is smaller than your average smartphone\nSimply click the handle closed for safe storage and slip it into your pocket to take it anywhere.\nInterested in Co-Branding?\nWe have designed the Draft Top tool to be easily customized to help promote your brand.  Just give us your logo and pick  your colors.\nCAD models shown\nCo-branding is not available during Kickstarter, please contact us at hello@drafttop.com for more information.\n\nHow did we get here?\nProudly American Made\nIt was very important for us to keep manufacturing here in the States. Not only does it help speed up delivery times and improve quality for our customers, but it allows us to utilize a network of talented manufacturers across the country. We are very pleased with the quality and support we have received from our vendors and look forward to working with them for future orders and products!\nOne of the injection molding machines in our manufacturer's facility\nProduction Has Begun\nFrom design to prototyping, tooling to production, the Draft Top tool has already started its journey from idea to reality. Take a look at what we've been up to.\nPLAY\n\nOne of the Draft Top tool's molds being manufactured\nPLAY\n\n Production parts being made in an injection molding machine\nDraft Top tools in their packaging\nHell or High Water - We're Making this Product\nAs you can see we have already initiated production for this product, so it\u2019s not a question of \u201cIF\u201d you will be rewarded with the product but \u201cWHEN\u201d. We have proven to deliver on our promise in the past and fully intend to do it again.\n                Thank you for your support because without you we wouldn\u2019t be here!!! \nDrink Topless \nThe Draft Top team\n\nFAQ's\n Why would I want this? Instead of smashing your nose against the aluminum top, you can smell the aroma of your drink. Not to mention a smooth pour and no clugging which makes you feel full. Or just Send It. \n When will this be delivered? We are anticipating early 2020. \n Do you ship overseas? Yes. Separate shipping rates apply.\n Can you get different colors? There will be additional color options in the future. Sign up for details or contact us at hello@drafttop.com \n Are you able to put another logo on the Draft Top? Yes, but not during Kickstarter. Minimum orders apply. Reach out to us at hello@drafttop.com for more details\n Does it leave a sharp edge? No, the cut occurs inside the rim of the can and folds the aluminum into the rim.  \n Are the blades sharp? No, in fact they are purposefully dull. We call them splitters. Technically they are splitting the metal and not cutting it.\n Will the splitters rust? If left in water for a few days or covered in soda or beer there is a likelihood that they will develop surface rust. They are made of 300 series stainless.  \n Can it be washed/is it dishwasher safe? We don't recommend using it in the dishwasher as it could affect longevity of the tool. We recommend just rinsing it using warm water after each session. \n How long will it last? We've tested samples on hundreds of cans and have prototypes that are still being used well above 1,000 cans \n Does it grab the top? No. If the top falls completely in, you have to flip it on its side and pull it out. If it partially cuts the lid, you can use the tool to fold it into the can like the tab normally folds in. \n So the top just falls in the can? Sometimes. It all depends on how the tool is used. If it partially cuts the lid, you can use the tool to fold it into the can like the tab normally folds in. \n Isn't the top dirty? Maybe but its the same top that you put your lips on when drinking from the can the normal way. So just Drink Topless! Its a lot better.  \n Does it work on Tall boys? Yes, most 16oz to 19oz cans. It does not work on most 24oz cans or the Fosters Oil Can\n Does it work on crowlers? No - those are good for a nice set of glasses\n How does it work? When holding the tool in either hand, the top right corner has a part of the handle that sticks out. When you push this in the handle opens and retracts the splitters to the center. With the opposite hand holding the can near the top or bottom near the bends, you place the tool on the can and slowly squeeze while starting to rotate. The four splitters move outward from the center when you squeeze the handle. They puncture the inside rim of the can just below the top and split the aluminum open as you rotate the tool. A minimum of a quarter twist is needed to fully remove the top but sometimes it take a half or full twist. Below the handle are grooves designed to allow you to rest them on the rim and push the lid in. Remember, the objective is to open the top not take the lid out.   \n Do you or will you sell replacement parts? Not at this time. \nThis project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 950+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $400M raised between them.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhile there is always a potential for unknown\u2019s to occur, the only challenge we can foresee at this time is uncertainty of delivery times based on the volume of orders.

Over the past 12mths we've drilled down all the way into the nitty-gritty details to build a comprehensive plan to launch Zero Co. But no matter how much planning we've done, the reality is that this is a start-up. There are risks and challenges that lie ahead. Here are some of the key ones we've identified:\n\n1. Maybe you won't like our products:\nDon't sweat, we've got you covered with our 100% 30-day money back guarantee. That means if you're not 100% satisfied with our products, send them back to us within 30 days and we'll refund your hard earned cash.\n\n2. What happens if we don't hit our fundraising target?\nKickstarter is an all or nothing funding platform. That means if we don't hit our funding target, all money is refunded to supporters. It's essentially another money-back guarantee.\n\n3. What happens if there are problems with our manufacturing process?\nWe're working with one of Australia's largest contract manufacturers of environmentally-friendly products. They currently manufacture for A LOT of big-name supermarket brands and have confirmed that they have capacity to deliver our products on time and on budget.\n\n4. Do we have the experience to pull-off a project as big as this?\nZero Co founder Mike Smith has been building start-ups for the past 10yrs+. He has successfully scaled a number of businesses. The senior management supporting Mike at Zero Co have extensive experience in their respective fields. The investment team and board are world-class entrepreneurs, business people and investors with decades of experience at the highest levels of business. Together this diverse group of professionals have outstanding credentials to deliver a project like Zero Co.\n\n5. What's to stop us running away to the Caribbean with all your money?\nZero Co founder Mike Smith has invested most of his life savings into this project. He's not getting a cent of that money back until the company starts to turn a profit.

It's an amazing device for note taking, drawing or just binging on Netflix. But one thing always bugged us: writing on it feels kind of like plastic on glass. It's awkward, tiring and the result is usually sloppy.\nThat's why, two years ago, we developed the original Paperlike screen protector and Kickstarter helped us make it come to life.\nSince then over 10.000 digital Artists, Sketchers, Notetakers and Business Professionals, all around the world, used their Paperlike constantly. \nAnd they had feedback. \nAnd we listened.\nOne thing came up again and again: The paper feel is great, the precision is great but the quality of the screen became too grainy. There was too much refraction going on.\nSo we went back to the drawing board, tinkered and experimented and today, we're super proud to present to you ...\n\nThe new Paperlike with Nanodots\u00ae Surface Technology\nMore paper-feel, less display noise.\nThe key ingredient for the new Paperlike is the new Surface Technology \"Nanodots\u00ae\". We called it that for a very simple reason: because we've basically sprinkled tiny dots across the screen protector's foil. These dots don't disturb the light as much, thus you get a rougher screen with less refraction.\nPaperlike\u00ae Nanodots\u00ae in action\nThe Paperlike is made for Artists, for Notetakers, for Creatives. It's made for Makers and Doers like you.\n\nDraw\nArtists all around the world love the Paperlike for the improved precision and tactile feel. We optimized the ideal amount of friction for long drawing sessions and the right stroke resistance for optimal accuracy. \n Write\nThe iPad is an amazing device for taking notes and for going paperless. But something's not quite right. The slippery feel of the plastic pencil tip on glass makes writing imprecise and tiring. \nThe Paperlike helps you combine all the advantages of a digital device while keeping the nice tactile feel of paper. \nMake sure you're ready for endless meeting notes or the scribble for your next big idea!\nEnjoy\nAfter you're done with all that making and doing, you might want to enjoy your iPad in a say \"less productive way\". Since the new Paperlike is made for superior display quality, nothing stands in the way of you and some relaxing hours of Netflix or Youtube. And you know what's best? The matte and glare resistant finish of the Paperlike even allows you to enjoy your screen time sitting in the sun. (Please apply sun screen where necessary, the Paperlike does not fix that. Yet.)\nAbout us\nToday, Paperlike is more than just Jan. He still has his fingers in every aspect of it, but we have an amazing team to support him and make all of this possible.\nSo, what are you waiting for? Back us on Kickstarter and help make the new Paperlike\u00ae with Nanodots\u00ae technology come to life!\nLove your iPad even more.\n\n\n\n-----", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nManufacturing and quality control: \nWe're working with an experienced manufacturer for the Paperlike 2, and they have consistently manufactured our prototypes with the right surface condition and material.

We called the magazine P8NT.\nWhat we didn't know at the time was that paintball was about to enter a period of massive growth that would transform every aspect of the industry. \nIn just a few short years we saw tournaments move out of the woods and onto airball fields, an explosion of new companies and equipment, the introduction of electronic guns, the war between the leagues and the creation of X-Ball, the quest to bring paintball to television and the emergence of high-paid, superstar players. Paintball would never be the same.    \nThis was an era when participation in the sport was exploding, and mainstream acceptance seemed to be just around the corner. For the first time, paintball would have to grapple with the possibility of corporate sponsors, television deals, six-figure contracts for professional players and a competitive environment that was like nothing anyone had seen before. \n2004 Tampa National Professional Paintball League event\nThe final issue of P8NT Magazine was published in 2004, at the height of this era. Since then, thousands of photos and hundreds of hours of interviews have sat untouched in storage.\nNow, exactly 20 years after its debut, the original team behind P8NT is reuniting to tell the story of one of the most exciting and important periods in the history of paintball, in a format that's never been seen before. \nF8MOUS is a limited edition, 350 page hardcover photo book collecting hundreds of photos, stories and interviews from one of the most revolutionary eras of tournament paintball. This is the story of how the passion and drive of a handful of players and industry leaders transformed paintball\u2014and what was gained, and lost, as a result.\nThis is an unfiltered, inside look at how a game became a sport.\nThis project is a labor of love for everyone involved, and we're turning to the paintball community to help bring it to life. F8MOUS is your opportunity to own a piece of paintball history\u2014but it's also a chance to help make history. \nChris Lasoya, playing for Team USA at the Nation's Cup inaugural X-Ball exhibition event (2002)\nADDITIONAL REWARDS\nEvery level of support includes a copy of F8MOUS. But for those who are able to go above and beyond to help bring this book to life, we've put together a series of exclusive rewards. \nWe're offering the basic book at a break-even price, in order to make it available to as many people as possible. At the supporter level and beyond, we'll include your name in a special section of the book as one of the people who made it possible.   \nAll of the photos in F8MOUS were shot on film, giving it a unique look and feel. As part of the original photo process, 8\" x 10\" contact sheets were produced for every roll of black and white film (color photos were primarily shot on slides). (LIMITED TO 50) \nWe've hand-selected 50 of these original contacts sheets from 1999 to 2004 and are making them available as a special, limited reward. Each sheet is printed on glossy photo paper and displays a full roll of film (approximately 36 images each) exactly as they were shot, complete with original grease-pencil notations from the photographer. \nThis is your chance to own a large, 11\" by 17\" giclee print of a photo by one of the original P8NT Magazine photographers. You can choose any one of the hundreds of photos in the book. These are high-quality, archival prints suitable for framing, and each one will be specially packaged and shipped flat. If you have a question about which photos are available, email paintballfamous@gmail.com and we'll let you know if we have what you're looking for.    \n(Just a few of the hundreds of photos you can choose from)\n\"These guys took it to a level that was hugely brave. Their design language didn\u2019t just move things on a bit, it showed everyone what can be achieved with great creative input ... Bravo. Take my money. I want my book.\" \u2013Al Woods, Planet Eclipse\n\"This magazine changed my life. I read every issue front to back 100 times. It motivated me to become pro, pursue travel\u2014and now is part of the inspiration for the Iron City Classic.\" \u2013Tim Montressor\n\"P8NT had an uncanny way of telling an entire story through a single image that literally made you feel like you were actually living that very moment of time without reading a single word. To this date, I have never come across this level of artistry within any other sport.\" \u2013(Dirty) Dave Pastore\n\"Ask those that where there, and they will tell you that P8NT defined an era in paintball history that we all hold dear.\" \u2013Jack Wood, Planet Eclipse\n\"If you are a fan of the sport, you should pitch in and help these guys get this off the ground. New school or old school. Doesn\u2019t matter. If you\u2019re old school, you know these guys rock and they\u2019re trying to give credit to those of us who helped bring this thing to life. If you\u2019re new school, you ought to respect and appreciate what got this sport to where it was when you found it.\" \u2013Lane Wright\nFor the duration of this Kickstarter campaign, we'll be posting regular updates on Instagram at @paintballf8mous and on Facebook at facebook.com/paintballf8mous. Follow along to get a look at some of the iconic photos that will be included in the book, as well as outtakes, work in progress, and some special surprises from the archives. \nQ: So, is this P8NT Magazine?\nA: Nope. But it is being made by many of the people who were involved in P8NT, including editor & publisher Christopher Hass, photo editor Chris Dilts, and designer and photographer Dan Mouradian. Dan Napoli, Matt Marshall, Sara Duckwall and Aaron Moore are also part of the team, and all of the photographers whose work will be included have given permission to include their photos in the book. If you were a fan of P8NT, you'll want a copy of F8MOUS. But even if you've never heard of P8NT, if you care about tournament paintball this is one you won't want to miss.\nQ: What exactly will be in the book?\nA: A whole lot of stuff: Hundreds of photos, many of which have never been seen before, as well as stories and interviews conducted from 1999 to 2004, many of which have never been published before. Together, they tell the story of the creation of the modern pro paintball scene.\nQ: When will I get my copy of the book?\nA: Work on the book has already begun, and if we're able to hit our funding goal we hope to have it completed by the end of the year. Everyone who orders a copy will have access to regular updates on the progress of the project, as well as behind-the-scenes looks of the book as it comes together.\nQ: Will the book be available outside of Kickstarter?\nA: Currently there are no plans to distribute the book beyond this limited edition run, so the only way to guarantee you'll get one is to order through the Kickstarter campaign. You have until August 29 to reserve a copy. \nQ: Where does the money go?\nA: This project is a labor of love for everyone involved, and all of us are volunteering our time. We want to produce the best possible book, and all of the money raised will be put back into the project. Here's a breakdown of how we plan to use the money:\nPrinting & production:            58%\nShipping:                                    15%\nPhotography services:            11%\nEquipment costs:                       5%\nVideo production:                      3%\nKickstarter fees:                         5%\nCredit card processing fees:   3%\nTOTAL:                                           100%*\n*(based on a $40,000 budget)\nIf you still have questions, or if you just want to drop us a line and let us know what you think about the book, you can email us at paintballf8mous@gmail.com.

The tighter you grip it, the more secure it the mechanism gets. It's built from the ground up and is backed for life. If a high-end titanium knife and a compact screwdriver had a kid, this would be it. \nTi EDS\nThe Backstory\nIn 2017, we created the Bit Bar to provide a way for people to comfortably EDC (everyday carry) a screwdriver and extra bits. Today, we are excited to show you our newest addition to the series that we call the Ti EDS. It's a more streamlined version of the original that has a few new tricks up it's sleeves.\n360\u00ba Spin View\nWhy Carry A Screwdriver? \nIt's amazing how many times a day we need a screwdriver and various bits (i.e. door hinges, hose clamp, kid toys, camera gear, honey-can-you-fix-that, etc.) but don't want to run back to our tool box for these trivial/small tasks. Somedays we like to keep a low-pocket profile so the original Bit Bar tends to stay in a drawer those days.  So, designing a more streamlined version with a built-in extension arm is what we wanted to tackle next. It's been the perfect size to get things done and yet not take over our pockets. \n4 Side Views\nUnique Features\nBringing all of these details below together is what make it special.\nSolid Grade 5 Titanium\nSecure Frame-Lock Mechanism\nBuilt-In 40mm Actuating Extension Arm\nPocket Clip/Lanyard/Keyring Friendly\nRare-Earth Magnets (to keep everything tidy)\nExtra 2 Bit Storage Tray (w/spring loaded ball bearing)\n100% Metal Construction (no plastic parts) \nSolid Grade 5 Titanium 40mm Extension Arm\nEvery single millimeter, chamfered edge, and tiny detail has been designed, re-designed and refined until we were happy with how it felt and functioned. \nThe extension arm rotates 180\u00ba and locks securely in the center of the tool.\nCountless Daily Uses\nVisual Size Comparisons \nVisual size comparisons (Left to right) : Ti EDC Wrench, KeyBar\u00ae, Ti EDS, Bit Bar, TPT Slide\nSecure Grip & Mechanism  \nThe tighter you grip it, the more secure the frame lock gets.\nNo Proprietary Bits, Use The Bits You Already Own\nWe know you already own a bazillion standard 1/4\" hex bits and that your perfect 3 bits to EDC are different from ours. So feel free to swap them out/customize the 3 hex bits with the ones you own and build your ultimate pocket screwdriver.\nMagnetic slotted tray for storing 2 extra bits. (accepts standard 1/4\" hex bits)\nA spring-loaded ball bearing provides quick access and keeps your bits in place when stored.\nEasy Open/Close\nQuick one-handed operation is key and the Ti EDS screwdriver intuitively opens and closes like a pocket knife. \nIt quickly opens & closes, just like a frame-lock style knife.\nWhat's Included? \nTi EDS Screwdriver (Stonewashed finish only)\n3 Hex Bits (S2 steel, standard 1/4\"bits)\nLifetime Service Warranty\nIncluded: Ti EDS Screwdriver + 1/4\" Flathead Bit + #2 Phillips Bit + T8 Torx Bit (Pivot Screw Size)\nSpecifications\nTi EDS Specs & Weights\nLifetime Service Warranty\nSimply said, if it breaks we'll repair it for you.\nIf you've been burned other companies in the past, let us assure you that's not gonna happen here. No red-tape, no corporate run-arounds, just good ol' fashion service.\nSo, does that mean you can smash it with a hammer/abuse it and get a new one for free?\nNope, but it does mean that if you have an issue under a normal-use situation that you think needs to be fixed/repaired you can simply shoot us an email, mail it back to us, and we'll help fix your screwdriver ASAP.\nHere's a link to our lifetime service & warranty page.\nTimeline\nMid-July thru Mid-August - KS funding period\nEnd of August - KS releases funds\nSeptember thru November - Production & QC\nDecember & January - Assembly, Packing, & Fulfillment\n\nWhy Kickstarter?\nOur company (Big Idea Design LLC) started back in 2011 after our very first Kickstarter project. So, to us it simply feels like home. We don't have (or want) any investors so we bring our new products to the Kickstarter community. We simply love being an active part of this community and making unique products with our backers that are built to last.\nChadwick & Joe - (Big Idea Design, LLC)", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our 28th kickstarter project so we are very comfortable knowing what it will take to bring this project to a successful completion.

The outsoles are available in black and white, and are constructed exactly the same \u2014 giving you the opportunity to mix and match different outsoles and insoles. \nMuvez LLC is a New York City-based footwear brand dedicated to reinventing traditional footwear by integrating modern design and peerless functionality.

Five years ago I created Valek - wooden engraved rolling pins to emboss pastry with fun patterns. It gave me a huge experience about managing a whole project (30 000+ sales and tons of 5-stars reviews): I had to be simultaneously CEO, factory worker, designer, after sales... \n I decided that I had to launch a new project that was really meaningful to me. I got the idea of making a women powered board game. So I founded Playeress. I wanted to make it meaningful, fun and durable. \n WHY I NEED YOUR SUPPORT \n I'll use the funds to buy a wood printer and an industrial wood sander, to manufacture the first batch of games and order first 1000 boxes. The funds will also cover the costs of those 28 stunning watercolor portraits.\nCREDITS: \nYann Girard-Kozerski - hot coffee and best sandwiches on the planet to keep me going, bold ideas and never ending support \n Daria Golab - stunning watercolor portraits \nLaura Froissart - motivation above human levels! and amazing communication managing\nSpecial thanks to my 3yo daughter Leia who left me without any doubts about my project by getting to know and absolutely falling in love with some of the mighty women while playing with the prototypes!\n  NOVEMBER 2018 - Kickstarter campaign and production of the first batch of games. \nDECEMBER 2018 - Shipping in time for Christmas! \nJANUARY 2019 - Second production (translated and personalized editions).

For more info see the update.\nAs with any product, there is the ugly threat of copies. The Bandicoot is pending design registration 201812762 and patent application 2018901607. We take infringement very seriously and will take legal action if required. (Sorry 'bout that. Now, to more exciting matters...)\nThe real story here is the fact that we haven't traded off optics for looks. We have both - form and function. Have a goosey at how this little ripper works:\nWe've placed these LEDs in the optimum position for their purpose. This means no bulky, hinged lighthead, no bulky battery pack on the back, and no elastic fabric over the top of your head to hold it all together.  \nWe will launch with 4 colours: Black / Midnight Blue / Red / Khaki Green\nThis is a common concern we hear. But fear not Fabio, it isn't sticky like in a rubber band. It's a matte finish that treats your hair kinder than Pantene.  \nThis is a rubber band. The Bandicoot is not.\nIf you want to look it up, the surface texture is called Yick Sang YS20043. Sounds fancy, right?  \nFear not Fabio! It won't tangle your locks.\nCamping is one of those categories where things don't really change all that much. There are a few big players in headlamps, and they simply add a few extra lumens, and update a couple of toggles on their headbands each year. We wanted to throw a cat among the pigeons, or a marsupial among the flaming galahs.  \nMost bright headlamps are bulky, ugly, fiddly, unwieldy, pricey and uncomfy.\nOr you can get them tiny, wimpy, and with a measly lumen output.  \nAs with bike bells, headlamps all pretty much look and work the same. And there are two specific problems we tried to solve: \nFabric elastic loses fidelity. This is an overly syllabic way of saying \"straps are crap\". We asked headlamp owners what the biggest issues were with this product and kept hearing \"the strap died before the light did\".  \nOur silicone band won't lose its strength, and doesn't need constant adjusting. Wearing a slightly thicker beanie? No probs, it'll stretch over.  \nIf you have a tiny headlamp, chances are it has an equally tiny output and one set of optics pointing in one direction. We wanted to introduce sophisticated optics - for reading; running; finding the toilet without waking up your other half; ambient light; and low light - but without the kerfuffle. equivalent to a potato... on the front of your lemon.  \nThe idea started years ago. That is, the idea to change the way headlamps worked and were worn.  \nWe looked at where the lights sat on the head.  \nThen decided they were probably in the right place for all the functions we wanted. But we wanted it toight. Like a toiger.  \nThe size and bulk, plus the hinges that you see on most multi-function headlamps are so cumbersome. We wanted to get a little crazy...\"unhinged\" if you will...so we created a \"Single Chassis\". \nIt's important to keep a low profile. (B'dm)\nIt's not unusual to have battery and LEDs together, but it is unusual to have them in one chassis at such low profile. The aim and the outcome? To provide a static platform that provided variable angle optics - each designed for specific tasks .....our designer set our engineer was no small one. \nBut Eli and the team only went and bloody did it!\nWe looked at fabrics, elastics, treatments, toggles and all sorts.  \nExploring strap texture and design\nAnd we came back to the benefits of silicone. After all, after a year or two, classic elastic straps becomes about as reliable as the waistband on your lucky* undies.  \nWe also realised there should be no \"loose ends\". So our toggle system of tightening is unique and easy to tighten or loosen.  \nA little bit of birds eye\nA little bit of side eye\nWe looked at the LEDs and found some interesting opportunities to innovate:  \n1. Colour Rendering Index (CRI): Reading lights are often too bright white OR too luke warm. Our downlights have a CRI of >90 which means objects\u2019 colours are represented accurately. \nHow dya like them apples?\nY\u2019know when you are in the supermarket and stuff just don\u2019t look quite right?.. Yeah, low CRI! This is great info for pub quiz, and\u2026designing headlamps. \n2. Battery Indicators: The reading lights are also the battery indicators  \n3. Our 3 core LEDs are from LumiLeds. We have selected particularly high efficiency LEDs to ensure optimum output, whilst retaining runtime. And the colour temperature is whiter, to provide excellent visibility at distance. \nWe made the decision to go Li-Po USB rechargeable. Why? Because the advantages are overwhelming. Save space, weight, your wallet, and the environment. Did you know one of our batteries is equivalent to 650 AAAs...  \nAnd to recharge is now extra easy with our PWR Bank range, directly into your computer, or via a USB wall charger.  \nPLEASE NOTE, WE WILL ASK FOR YOUR DELIVERY ADDRESS IN LATE JUNE - AFTER THE CAMPAIGN FINISHES. \nKnog is best known as a cycling accessories brand. But we're designers first. A small team of hungry creatives, engineers and designers who like to disrupt everything. Especially the boring. Especially the stuff that people have resigned to \"it'll always be that way\". \nYep, those are the feathers we like ruffling. We had a great campaign with the Oi bike bell in 2016 which has gone on to sell 1 million units around the world, and win several design awards. THANK YOU for your support! We are humbled.\nBut cycling is just one outdoor activity. We want to extend the reach of our consumers to the campsite, running trail and beyond.  \nSo that's why we're back here on Kickstarter. We want to see if you - the Kickstarter audience - agree. We think it's a great product, of course. We've done our homework, met retailers and consumers, all who think Bandicoot is a good idea. But there's no more valuable validation data than someone parting with their hard-earned money (even if only a bit) to support the product.\nTHANK YOU!

Sporkatula? Foonula? We couldn't decide, so we decided to call it Morsel. \nWe wanted to design a better utensil that solved all the shortcomings we saw in conventional sporks and camping utensils. And after a year of serious sporking, we think we've succeeded.\nSquishy but not sticky, for easy scraping on any surface.\n      Eating should never be the crux of an adventure, so our goal is to make eating just a little bit easier, no matter what you're eating out of.\nScrape every last bit of food, every single time. More food in your stomach, less cleaning, and less waste.\nMorsel's long length is perfect for scraping every last bit of food from your Mountain House meal without getting your hands dirty.\nSometimes length matters.\n      Morsel is designed to be more versatile and useful than other utensils. Simply put, it's designed to work better.\nPro Tip: Morsel is a perfect gift for anyone who eats food.\n     Stretch goals are additional goals in case we exceed our original funding target - like if (by some miracle) Morsel goes viral on the interwebs.\nWe have a bunch of wild ideas for spin-off products, and if our campaign is successful enough we'll be able to bring them to life too. Ideas like...\nCool Colors - Get a spork to match your style\nMorsel Mini - Same spork, smaller size\nMorsel Spoon - For the spooning purist\nDo you dig it?

If not for us, then do it for the adorable little Morsel Mini.\nBy supporting Morsel's Kickstarter, you are helping us fund the injection molds and food-grade materials needed to order our first batch and make Morsel a reality.\nBut more than that, you're helping support a couple of freelance inventors who have spent an entirely unfathomable amount of time and energy designing... a really cool spork.\nMorsel Spork is just the start. We want to continue creating innovative and functional culinary contraptions - ones that work equally well for the discerning outdoorsy person, the family picnicker, or the van-dwelling vagabond.\nWe're here to shake up the spork industry, and you're invited.\nWe're two Portland-based product designers trying to bootstrap our way into spork production. We've already collaborated on a bunch of cool freelance design projects, and as individuals we've each successfully launched and fulfilled crowdfunding campaigns. Over the last decade we both worked in product engineering and creative design environments, and are experts at turning napkin sketches into real things (for realsies).\nZac | Website\nAlex | Portfolio | Website\nIt started with a simple idea: to make a spork with a rubber edge.\nZac just wasn't satisfied with the sporks on the market. He vented to Alex about how camping sporks were all basically the same, and they all sorta sucked at being used as eating utensils. He wanted something that would fit any shape - which led to the idea of having a soft, rubbery spoon.\nThis was probably the first of Zac's countless silly product ideas that had genuinely piqued Alex's interest. The whole product could be simple, elegant, and functional - and they felt that previous attempts at reinventing the spork had fallen short of what a spork could truly be.\nThey agreed to tackle the Ultimate Spork Project, and set to work. Following a traditional product design process, they began by examining all the things they did and didn't like about current spork tech. They started dreaming of all the ways they could impove the spork. And they spent beer-fueled nights sketching concepts on post-it notes, sorting ideas, and evaluating manufacturing risks and feasibilty for different concepts.\nAfter a lot of heated discussion, emotions, and coffee, they started to focus in on a general design plan. From there, they spent countless hours sketching and hand-carving sleek models out of foam, creating 3d-printed concepts, and working on the design's functionality and manufacturability.\nThe quest for a better spork was on.\nWe started making a list of all the other little things that annoyed us about conventional sporks. Things like...\nTiny, barely-functional fork tines\nSpoons that drip liquids\nHandles that break too easily\nHandles too short for deep food bags\nWe wanted to address all these common spork complaints, while blending the solutions into a single, elegant utensil. One that functioned as well as any normal kitchen cutlery, and one that didn't feel like a compromise.\nOur designs evolved, literally, into a complex asymmetric shape that allows for continuous contact, whether digging into tight corners, or scraping along the surfaces of big bowls.\nWe've crafted countless prototypes from clay, foam, and plastic, and we've bought fancy 3d-prints to validate and test our design.\nMorsel is the result a year and a half of spork-centric obsession. A quest to create the rad, versatile utensil that we always secretly wanted, and you never knew you needed - until now.\nAs a couple of product design perfectionists, we're proud of what Morsel has become - an expression of form that makes no sacrifices in function.\nOr, in the words of a random internet person...\n     We still need your help to spread the word.

Now you\u2019re faced with a huge dilemma\u2026do you \u201cattempt\u201d to defrost it faster? Or do you scrap your plans all together? YT Touch Defrosting Tray will defrost rock-hard meats, poultry, and fish in as little as in 20 minutes.\n\nThe material of YT Touch defrosting tray is Aero-aluminum with enamel coating, which is food grade material with FDA standard.\n   Best of all, there\u2019s no messy overflow to clean up after defrost. All the water is carefully run off and trapped in a safe, water secure tray underneath the tray.\n           In order to increase the defrosting speed, the other frozen food should turn-up every 5 minutes.\nDefrosting time depends on food contact area, temperature, humidity and turn-up times. The tests results just for reference.\n  You could attempt to run water over it and defrost it faster, but then you\u2019re washing away vital nutrients, minerals, and its most potent flavors. Additionally, thawing your meat on this tray reduces the spread of contaminates microwave defrosting poses. Because there is no heat source, there is no chance of spreading salmonella, staph, or any other contagious disease.\n You could possibly defrost it in the microwave, but then you\u2019re faced with a bigger problem. When you defrost foods in the microwave, some parts may defrost while others don\u2019t. You could also get certain parts of the meats defrost too close to cooking temperatures, which can be dangerous to one\u2019s health.\n      The design of the cast-molded aluminum literally pulls the cold and frost out of your food, reducing your thawing time from several hours to sometimes minutes!\nOnce thawed, you can even use the tray as a cutting board for dicing and slicing. If you want to thaw out beef and then slice it for fajitas, you can easily do it with the tray.\n                  Aerospace aluminum is an ultra-high strength deformed aluminum alloy, it's currently used in a wide range of aerospace industry, it has good mechanical and processing properties, compared with the ordinary aluminum alloy, its mechanical and processing performance is much better. \nAfter a completed examination YT Touch received following international certifications: LFGB/DGCCRF/FDA. \n            \n\nThis project is promoted by Jellop, a direct response online advertising agency specializing in Kickstarter campaigns on Facebook Ads and Google AdWords. \n                     ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhile we realize that it is virtually impossible to foresee every possible risk and challenge that we will face in the future, we have made every attempt to address those that we have anticipated.\n\nWe are already in close contact with the manufacturing plant, and they are fully prepared and are awaiting the start of the production.\n\nOur team also has an opportunity to personally verify each shipment to make sure that every customer receives their order without any defects.\n\nWe will work hard to meet all deadlines, get rewards to everyone on time, and keep you all up to date along the way.

Sitpack ZEN is a truly ergonomic, height adjustable chair that lets you relax whilst maintaining a good posture. \n3 years ago we created Sitpack here on Kickstarter. Now, with the awesome help of 7071 backers from KS and Makuake in Japan, we\u2019re thrilled to be back with another great innovation.  \nSitpack ZEN-XI | weight: 460g / 0.99lbs | Weight capacity: 136Kg/300lbs\nSitpack ZEN-XII | weight: 360g / 0.79lbs | Weight capacity: 136Kg/300lbs \nZEN XI - Matte black anodized aluminium tubes\nZEN XII - Matte black carbon tubes \nSitpack ZEN was created based on feedback from thousands of backers \u2013 who wanted portable seating to be made: more COMPACT, STRONGER, LIGHTER, MORE ADJUSTABLE and much, more COMFORTABLE.  \nOur core philosophy is to employ leading edge technology to reach these goals and make portable seating convenient, awesome and easy to use.\nWhen we first made the Original Sitpack we started with the existing cylindrical shape of the 500ml beverage can. When we went back to the drawing board, we let our imagination run free - and crafted something built of materials that were sufficiently strong and light enough to fulfill all our expectations.\nThe Y-Shape of the ZEN is the perfect angle to suspend a seat that is ergonomically designed to adopt the correct shape by using the weight of the user. The \"hammock\" shaped seat provides both optimal comfort and flexibility.\nBy using only the finest materials we are able to build to the tightest and most demanding specifications. We don\u2019t compromise on materials. We want this chair to last you a lifetime.\nMade with more intuitive features - eg markings along the tubes, Sitpack ZEN can be used straight out of the box. By following the white markings you\u2019ll be set up in seconds. Open, pull, twist and enjoy. While developing the product, and during the coming months we will be co-designing the white markings on each tube, with feedback from our backers.\n   We make the Sitpack ZEN series from only the finest available materials: carbon \ufb01ber, aerospace grade aluminium, tactical mesh, ballistic fibre and Kevlar webbing. By matching the performance of these materials with precision engineering we\u2019ve produced the most robust, height adjustable, lightweight chair in the universe. Or have we? Any extra terrestrials out there? Bring it on! Make our day!\nBy using Sitpack ZEN at the office and at longer, standing events you are able to train and maintain a good posture, which, in turn, boosts your energy levels, your motivation and your concentration.\nStuck at a desk all day? Well, our bodies are not designed for it, nor are we designed to stand. Humans are designed for walking. Sitpack ZEN is the solution that lets you stay active whilst doing a sedentary job. I bet you are slouching overyou laptop right now?\nIt's no secret that your work position can quickly lead to neck or back aches, which can turn into chronic pain. Everyone experiences this type of pain in their life. We\u2019re here to help improve your sitting/standing posture and to help avoid these shooting pains.\nIf you use Sitpack ZEN for just 30 minutes a day, we guarantee that you'll feel the difference. Use Sitpack ZEN at the office. Make watching TV, gaming and any outdoor activity where you have to stand for a long time a posture improving, active event.\nIn order to make Sitpack ZEN the slimmest and lightest portable seat in the world we had to push the technologies and the materials to the limit. Everything down to the screws has been specifically designed for the purpose and custom made in order to avoid any compromises in quality, weight and size.\nSitpack ZEN is the result of combining the design ideas of old fashioned foldable seats with the structural solutions to be found in nature. Nature provides us with examples of the most elegant and material-light constructions. So why not follow them? \n          We have successfully created and fulfilled a kickstarter project before. Since we launched Sitpack back in Oct. 2014 - we\u2019ve honed our skills and vastly improved our production and sourcing network to bring you a product of the highest quality. Design Awards are expensive, so we\u2019ve only got three. We\u2019re much more interested in your appreciation of what we are doing.\n          PRESS KIT\nShipping\nWhen an order is placed, it will be shipped to an address designated by the purchaser as long as that shipping address is compliant and verified by our warehouse.

Sitpack reserves the right to make changes based on continuous testing, production and material selection.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIn the past, our most difficult problem was production delays. Since we launched our first Kickstarter project in November 2014, we have gained an incredible amount of experience in manufacturing technically advanced products. This time round we are much further along the production process for Sitpack ZEN than we were with our first project. We've completed the first set of custom tooling for Sitpack ZEN. However, with a product that has to go through some 100 hands before the final touches we can only control so much. In the past, we encountered all kinds of setbacks and tried to foresee any new ones. As a result we give genuine delivery times that have some slack built in.\n While we can't control every issue that may pop up, but we can and will promise to communicate transparently and as often as necessary with all our backers - much as we did during our first campaign.\n\nRefund Policy \n\nKickstarter is not a store but created as a donation-based platform for helping ordinary people bring their ideas to life, using crowdfunding. We are not a large company by any means and all funds are used to sustain quality and ensure that our pledge is delivered to your doorstep.

If there is a problem or defect with your product when you receive it, we would be happy to assist you. Please contact us at hello@stipack.dk In accordance with Kickstarter\u2019s Terms and Conditions. We are not obliged to refund pledges post-campaign, as pledged funds are immediately set a set aside for production.

If you are truly not satisfied with your Sitpack Pro Pledge, we will refund your original pledge minus 20%, which helps to fund our contractual production agreement with our partners, as well as the 10% Kickstarter crowdfunding fees.

Not only did you help bring Orbitkey to life, you also allow us to focus on making great products and keep doing the things we love \u2013 without the influence of outside investors. We love the community and communication that comes with creating a new product, and we are grateful for the many friends we have met along the way, many of which have joined our team.\nThis new project is the result of countless feedback and hard work for the past few years. We hope to have you join us on our journey towards better living.\nDesign Process\nWe always try to be conscious of what we\u2019re designing. To focus less on the quantity, and instead focus more on quality of the small but considered selection of products. Our hearts, minds and even weekends were poured into these new products, and we are excited to be sharing the process with you.\nAdaptable design. Often, we are locked into things that you need to carry every day because it was very difficult to do otherwise. From the onset, we wanted to create something that truly flexible and versatile \u2013 both on the micro and macro level. Each component of the system is designed to work with each other and your belongings seamlessly. Our ring is designed to allow you to be more flexible with the things you need to carry. It allows you to quickly detach anything you do not need. This way, you can carry just the essentials at any given time.\nBeautiful construction. Similar to our previous products, we blend traditional craft with the modern production process, to create something that\u2019s uniquely elegant and functional. Together with our manufacturing partners, we aim to create consistent, high-quality goods that are going to serve you for a long time. In order for us to create a highly accurate leather goods, we had to design custom jigs to assist with aligning the components at the right place during construction. Each individual metal components have to go through many different processes to ensure the dimension accuracy and high-quality cosmetic finishes.\nMaterial Science. Every component has been considered down to the very last details, including the material. Both the Ring and Clip have a unique construction. The design relies on two materials\u2013so different in characteristic\u2013working harmoniously to create a truly functional accessory. Finding a suitable material for this proves to be quite challenging. We needed to find a material that is flexible but has a really good shape-memory. This way, it will be easy to operate and will return to its original form straight after usage. After many failed attempts, we found that glass-filled polymer is the most suitable material for our application. Compared to the native polymer, it has improved mechanical properties of rigidity, strength and surface hardness \u2013 all while maintaining the flexibility. \nPatent Pending Locking Mechanism. One of the most challenging things in the entire process is designing a locking mechanism that is secure but also easy to unlock when you need to. It took a while, but we created many different types of locking feature design and ended up with the one that works really well. Our locking feature design automatically drops into place when a full rotation has been made \u2013 ensuring that the inner ring will not rotate unintentionally. We also added a pull tab, so you can easily unlock the mechanism when you need to. In the process of creating an intuitive design, we ended up with an iconic look/silhouette for the product that we carried through to the design of the Clip.\nDesigned with you in mind. Similar to the original Orbitkey key organiser, the new products feature very clean aesthetic and minimal branding. The result is understated elegance that you can carry everywhere confidently. We\u2019ve spent many hours, creating countless prototypes of different designs for each component. The size and usability are some of the most critical aspects we focus on perfecting. The final size was dictated by the ease-of-operation, size of keys, and also correct proportion. The surface is smooth to make it a pleasant accessory to interact with. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis will be Orbitkey\u2019s 3rd Kickstarter campaign, the previous campaigns have given us valuable experience in all aspects of bringing a product to life and running a crowdfunding campaign. It has made us better prepared in the challenges associated with Tooling, Production, Logistics, Communication and delivering a high-quality product. \n\nIn the past when we have encountered unforeseen obstacles, we have always handled them swiftly and efficiently, and have always conducted things in the best interest of our backers and orbitkey family. We always keep our backers updated and with complete transparency. \n\nFor this campaign, we are working with suppliers that we have previously worked with and using manufacturing methods that we are very familiar with. We have taken considerable efforts to make us better prepared, including starting on production tooling prior to the campaign and ahead of schedule. We will also have a team member on the ground, keeping a close eye on production throughout the production process.\n\nWe are confident in our ability to deliver you a great high-quality product, but despite our experience and familiarity with our supplier partners, we understand the risk associated and unforeseen challenges that comes with bringing a product to life. \n\nTooling - We are incredibly proud of our previous products but to achieve the high level of finish and quality we have set ourselves, there can often be multiple rounds of adjustment which may cause the production to be subject to delays. This is something that we have prepared for and reason we have already begun tooling for the new designs ahead of schedule.\n\nLogistics - Over the past 4 years, we have built a robust and efficient supply chain, however we are also aware of certain circumstances that are beyond our control (e.g. natural disasters and strikes). We have built in extra buffer to accommodate for these in our timeline and we promise to always be transparent with you and to prioritise our Kickstarter Backers.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 13 or more", "title": "Orbitkey Ring", "descp": "Get ONE Orbitkey Ring - No more pinched fingers and broken nails.\nAdd additional items to this reward using the Add-ON Menu (see FAQ).\nINCLUDES:\nOrbitkey Ring", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["673 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 24 or more", "title": "2 x Orbitkey Ring", "descp": "Get TWO Orbitkey Rings.

We'll demo products and answer any question you've got:\nWhat is all this?\nWe're Peak Design, a San Francisco based product design company. We're also the luckiest goobers on the planet; we engineer and make world-class photography gear, and we both shape it and share it with the Kickstarter community.\nWe've got new stuff, and you can pre-order it by backing this Kickstarter project. Your new gear will ship worldwide before the end of this year!\nThis is Peak Design's 7th Kickstarter project! Holy Toledo, we can't even believe it ourselves. This time around, with your help, we are making our best products even better.\nHow to back this campaign:\n1. Click \"Back this project\"\n2. Pick your reward level\n3.

Check out the Add-On Menu and increase your pledge amount accordingly\nFor detailed instructions, scroll down to the bottom of this page or see the FAQ.\nJump to: Add-On Menu | Reward Menu | FAQ\nWhat are we making?\nAll-New Capture v3\nIt's a metal clip that lets you rigidly carry any camera on your backpack strap, belt, or bag. Take your camera more places, keeping it secure and instantly accessible. Our new design is made of beautiful machined and anodized aluminum, and is smaller, lighter, more durable, and more comfortable than ever before. There's a also new Pro Pad for heavy rigs or all-day carry.\nAll-New Slide + Slide Lite\nThey're the world's most quick-connecting, versatile, stable, and comfortable pro camera straps, one for DSLRs and one for mirrorless. All hardware and materials have been updated for better comfort, smoother operation, increase durability, and gorgeous aesthetics.\nWhy did we make 'em?\nThere are a million straps, harnesses, and holsters out there for carrying cameras, and none of them met our needs. They were bulky, flimsy, frumpy, floppy, and frustrating. We knew we could do better.\nWhy are we updating them now?\nYou (our Kickstarter backers) brought Capture, Slide, and Slide Lite to life several years ago, and those earlier versions are really, really great products. Since then, we've learned tons, and we knew we could make these core products even better. Our backers demand the best, and we feel inclined to give ya'll just that.\nPeak Design has enormous plans for 2018. But before we start our next adventure, we had to give these three products the performance and aesthetic upgrades they deserve. Like momma used to say: dance with the one who brought ya. Now, let's meet these products:\n Capture: why is it so exceptionally dope?\nCapture is, in our humble opinion, the best damn way to carry a camera. It keeps your camera rigidly secure, yet instantly accessible with the click of a button. \n   Jump to:  Add-On Menu  |  Reward Menu  |  FAQ\n    Slide + Slide Lite: What makes 'em so freaking sweet?\nHave you ever used a traditional camera strap? You're probably all too familiar with bouncing cameras, clunky connectors, annoying shoulder pads, tripod incompatibility, and frumpy looks. With Slide and Slide Lite you get none of that, and all of this:\n    Jump to: Add-On Menu | Reward Menu | FAQ \n  Now for the nitty gritty.\nWow, you've really made your way down the page. Maybe that's because you're looking for more details. Well, lucky for you we didn't spare a single one.\nJump to: Add-On Menu | Reward Menu | FAQ  \nAnd now for the big question...\n    Reward Menu \nAdd-On Menu\nNot sure how to use the Add-On Menu? Read this FAQ.\nNot sure how to use the Add-On Menu? Read this FAQ. For more info on what all these products are, visit peakdesign.com.\nWhy such a short campaign?\nThere's a lot going on at Peak Design right now. We've launched over 20 SKUs in the last few months. It's almost holiday season. And, we'll soon be launching our own flagship retail store in San Francisco. We're keeping this campaign short and sweet so we provide top-notch service to our backers without dropping the other balls we have in the air. We also want to ship all rewards out before the end of the year! \nWhen will it all ship?\nWe expect all rewards to leave our warehouses by mid December. That means that many of you will receive awards before the end of the year and even before the holidays.\nPlease note that we cannot guarantee that rewards will ship by a certain date, and once rewards are in the mail, we have even less control over how long it takes them to reach your doorstep. We'll do everything in our power to get rewards out the door by early December, but we can't make any absolute promises. See the FAQ for details.\n  This project is promoted by Jellop, a direct\u00ad response online advertising agency specializing in Kickstarter campaigns on Facebook Ads and Google AdWords.\n       ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our 7th Kickstarter project since 2011, so we've had ample time to hone our design, manufacturing, shipping, and supply chain management processes. Most importantly, we've gotten pretty darn good at setting our customers' expectations accurately and delivering on our promises.\n\nBut no matter how much we've got our poop in a group (official midwestern terminology) things can still go awry. If they do, we solemnly promise to give you full transparency into the issues and solve them in a way that leaves our backers happy and proud to support our company.\n\nSupply Chain Risk: Sometimes a machine or tool breaks. Sometimes a factory loses power for a day. Sometimes we get the wrong parts or materials in. These things happen from time to time and can affect how long it takes to build our products.\n\nShipping Risk: It's the holiday season, the busiest shipping time of the year. Every year, record breaking volumes can cause port congestion, over-stuffed warehouses, and shipping service delays.\n\nActs of God: We're based in San Francisco. That means we could have an earthquake. Or we could have the Wellness Coach Convention and the Artisan Toast Convention scheduled for the same weekend (can you imagine finding a place to brunch, let alone park the Subaru?!).

The action happening all around you, sound flying past your ears.\nImagine combining your favorite stories and games with the immersive power of VR, regardless of genre and no matter how they were originally made.\nWith CINERA, you can dive into it all, watch it all, play it all, hear it all. And you can do it from your own home.\nThe CINERA Difference\nAt CINERA, we look at things differently.\nInstead of asking how we can make your home cinema more like a movie theater, we asked how we could make your home movie-watching, show-streaming, video-gaming experiences better?\n All Of Your Favorite Media In Stunning Detail\nDual 2.5K Resolution (2560 x 1440 x 2)\nWith ground-breaking dual 2.5K displays, CINERA is a pioneer in the headset industry. You\u2019ll enjoy all your favorite media at a resolution 8X that of an iPhone 7+ . . . and 3X that of a movie theater screen! \nCheck out this video to see what we mean.\nPLAY\n\nGet Into the Action with the Best 3D \nBefore, the only way to get a high-quality 3D movie experience was at the theater. Now you can watch 3D even better from your couch.\nTo give the illusion of 3D, most movie theaters project two distinct images onto the same screen through polarizing filters. Your big, plastic glasses filter out the images so one eye sees only one version.\nIn this process, you lose more than 75% of the light\u2014and the images never quite match up. This is why you often lose the crispness of the images, and why some people even feel nauseous.\nBETTER 3D THAN THE MOVIE THEATER\nCINERA's dual-screen architecture eliminates this problem entirely. Its native stereoscopic display system means each of your eyes has its own individual display panel and light path, there is no filter and no loss of quality. So you can to enjoy brighter, more vivid 3D images than ever before. \n  See More Than Ever With Super-Wide Field of View\nENTHRALLING SCREEN SIZE\nA lot of the reason why movie theaters provide such an enthralling experience is because you feel immersed in the film.\nTypically this is done by making a physically larger screen. However, bigger doesn\u2019t always mean better.\nYour vision consists of two portions: a central portion (30 degrees in either direction of the center), and a peripheral portion (the rest of your vision range).\nEven though we perceive objects in our peripheral area as blurred, making an experience truly immersive requires that the visuals extend into that space.\nAfter extensive testing, we believe we have found the perfect combination of clear image and the feeling of immersion: 66 degrees.\nPLAY\n\n    Never Miss a Detail\nDual Screen Solution\nMost existing headsets use a single screen and split it down the middle into left and right regions. This leaves each eye with a square-like peephole with an aspect ratio of 0.89.\n\nIf you\u2019re wondering why this feels so inadequate, it\u2019s because most movies have an aspect ratio of 2.39. So when you play a movie on a typical headset, to keep the ratio, only about 47% of the screen can be used\u2014rendering over half the pixels useless.\nPLAY\n\nWith more than half the pixels out of commission, it\u2019s no wonder the image quality suffers.\nTo give you the highest quality display ever, CINERA provides an entire unique display panel for each eye. Each of these panels are optimized for movie-viewing, letting more than 95% of all the pixels shine.\nMore Pixels, More Quality . . . Or Not?\nYou probably have heard of PPI, or Pixels Per Inch. (Most of us became familiar with the term thanks to Apple\u2019 retina display.)\nWhile PPI can be a helpful stat, it doesn\u2019t tell the entire store. PPI only illustrates the pixel density of a display\u2014not necessarily what the human eye can actually see. Your sight can be affected by a handful of other factors, like distance to the display or optical lens.\nPIXELS PER DEGREE (PPD)\nInstead, a more efficient way to measure display quality is with PPD\u2014Pixels Per Degree. \nPPD translates to the number of pixels per degree in human vision. The higher the number, the nicer quality image you get to enjoy. Here are a comparison of PPD between CINERA and several other headsets:\n All of the Action, None of the Pressure\nEnjoy CINERA with the Burden Free Arm \n*UPDATED ARM*\n\nWe added an all-new functionality that allows the arm to connect to the goggles from either the top OR the bottom. Check out these short videos to watch it in action.\nConnect from the bottom to preserve space\n  Or connect from the top for some more hand-to-mouth clearance.\nThe last thing you want when you\u2019re watching your favorite media to get fatigued.\nMost headsets require you to put the entire stress of their product on your head. This can be burdensome over long stretches of time, leading to discomfort or even health issues.\nWe totally eliminate this problem, with hands-free CINERA arm.\nBRING THE POWER OF THE MOVIE THEATER TO YOUR COUCH\nFinally\u2014the comfort of your couch with the high-quality movies you love. With the zero-stress hands-free arm, you\u2019ll be more relaxed than ever.\nWATCH MOVIES HOW YOU WANT\nWith its a easy-to-use built in pump, you can move Cinera to practically any position without a lot of force. You\u2019ll enjoy complete freedom\u2014watch standing, sitting on your couch, or even lying down flat.\n  PROTECT YOUR HAIR STYLE\nOkay, maybe it\u2019s not the first thing you think of when you hear \u201cmovie experience.\u201d But it\u2019s true\u2014headsets destroy hairdos.\nSomeone\u2019s solution was to shave his head! But don\u2019t worry, we\u2019re not going to let you go that far. With the burden-free arm, you\u2019ll end the movie with the same gorgeous hair you had at the start.\nBONUS: CONTROL YOUR DRONE CAMERA WITH STYLE \nSee Why People Love CINERA\nPLAY\n\nA Note From Our Designer\nPLAY\n\n  FPV Head Mount\nWhen you aren\u2019t watching movies, Cinera\u2019s First-Person View (FPV) head mount is perfect for flying your drones.\nHigh-Quality Display\nWide-View Angle\nEmbedded 4-Hour Battery (with head mount)\n9-Axis Gyroscope\nYou\u2019ll be controlling your drone\u2019s camera with a tilt of your head in no time!\n   Upgrade Your Personal Entertainment\nConnect with your favorite devices and applications to take your entertainment to the next level.\nWATCH YOUR FAVORITE STREAMING SHOWS\nEasily install your favorite streaming apps like Netflix, YouTube, Hulu, and HBOGo. You\u2019ll instantly be able to enjoy the content you love in a gant screen way bigger than your local movie theater.\nAs another option, you can also play files from your local video archive either using a micro-SD card or your network server.\n   CONNECT WITH HDMI\nHook up your favorite Blu-ray player, gaming console, or computer with Cinera\u2019s HDMI Input to take your gaming from the little screen to the silver screen.\nYou feel surrounded by the story\u2014like you\u2019ve been invited for a couple hours to leave your own life and enter someone else\u2019s. No home theater system could ever come close to the enthralling screen size, the gorgeous detail, the heart-racing surround sound.\nAll the Details\n    * We plan to upgrade CINERA HDMI from 1.4a to 1.4b . We got many requests urging us to upgrade HDMI so as to fully utilize Cinera\u2019s 2.5K ultra high resolution displays. We heard you. Based on our engineering team\u2019s evaluation, it CAN BE DONE! We are working to upgrade Cinera\u2019s HDMI from 1.4a to 1.4b, which supports 2.5K resolution input.\n\nHowever, this is still a preliminary analysis, which requires further reviewing and testing. We will release a final update before the campaign ends, so our backers can make a final decision then. But we suggest you to pledge as soon as possible, as the super early bird units are almost all gone\nCINERA and all the Accessories\n01: Cinera Headset\n02: Power Adapter\n03: Micro USB Cable\n04: Burden- Free Arm\n05: 2-in-1 Mouse and Keyboard Remote (STRETCH GOAL!)\n06: FPV Head Mount (Purchased Separately)\nWhat they say about CINERA\n  PLAY\n\n\nHello from the CINERA team!\nAbout CINERA\nCinera, Inc., is incorporated in Newark, Delaware.\n\nThe company was founded in 2014 by a group of enthusiastic and passionate entrepreneurs who love movies and technology, and is scheduled to launch its first product\u2014a head-mounted personal theater system\u2014in the summer of 2017.\n\nCinera Inc.\u2019s mission is to revitalize the big-screen experience outside a movie theater, so movie lovers could enjoy movies with highest quality and great convenience with comfort.\n\n    Strech Goals\n\n\n  We have unlocked our 1st stretch goal !

A story that turned into a dream to being able to protect the people from mosquito borne diseases.\n\nThe increasing population on earth and urbanization all over the world is causing problems everywhere around the world. The current indoor mosquito traps have been based on technology from the past. We had to re-invent.\n\nSo we went back to the drawing board, adding in research and innovations from the last few years to develop a new generation of smart mosquito traps that are suitable for the current society. Efficient and effective. \nThe Story of Brian Lamsee\none of our close friends that has had a tragedy happen on his vacation with his grandson. Afterwards he had a Dream and a Purpose. Development of the MBOX.\nPLAY\n\n  Design in Progress\n  Help us spread the word on Facebook!\n    We will continue the fight! And need your Help!  \nOur mission is to protect people from mosquito borne diseases and help people that have caught these terrible diseases. We cannot fight this alone and we need your help. Time is ticking and nobody knows when the next deadly mosquito disease is going to appear.\nQM Limited has a long history of fighting against mosquitoes in Hong Kong. QM has developed many traps in cooperation with public instances in Hong Kong. But this is was only our first step, we have technology to create even more efficient mosquito traps and we want to be able to give everyone a chance to use it to fight against mosquitoes at home. \nMosquito borne disease keep mutating and who knows when a new one will appear. Mosquitoes are already the world deadliest animal that kills over 750.000 people a year(Gates Notes). Even though we can continue the road we have walked in the past, but time is something we cannot fight and only with your help we can accomplish this fight and give our children a safer world.\n  The Trapping Methods\nTechnology Packed\nThe Mosquito Box uses a combination of different methods to specifically lure female mosquitoes (the ones that bite) into our traps.  Below you can find the list of technology and links to their workings.\n- Co2/H2o from the Tio2 coated surface    \n- Dark color design    \n- Heat & Spectral Wavelengths from the CCFL/UV Light    \n- (optional) Attractants from Biogents (Germany) \nPhotocatalysis effect (Tio2 -> co2/h2o) (Air Purify)\nFemale mosquitoes track humans by tracing Co2 and H2o. They can track Co2 up to 50 meters and follow it back to the place of origin. \nThe UV light of the Mosquito Box irradiates a surface coated with Titanium Dioxide to enable the photo catalysis effect (see below) to lure mosquitoes.\nThis effect is discovered by Dr. Akira Fujishima from Tokyo University of Science and it helps simulate the human breath of Co2 and moisture that mosquitoes use to track their prey.\nPhotocatalysis\n  Titanium Dioxide Coating\nMosquito Sight (Mirror Surface) (Dark Color Design) \nMosquitoes have 2 compound eyes. The compound eyes are made up of many hundreds if not, thousands of lenses called ommatidia. \nTesting with different colors we noticed that mosquitoes prefer the color black over any other. Another interesting fact is that mosquitoes stay in groups. With our Mirroring surface it will give the feeling to the mosquito that she is not flying alone to the prey and increase the chances of the mosquito nearing our Mosquito Box.\nFrom a Mosquito's Perspective\n  USB 3.0 (Quick Charge) / (Heat Generation)\nWe have incorporated a USB 3.0 to easily recharge your Phone. We have thought of many ways in increasing the heat generation of the Mosquito Box to attract mosquito's but many would incorporate wasting energy to generate heat. \nBy adding the USB Charger to charge your phone, the Mosquito Box and your Phone produces extra heat to attract mosquitoes, This way it will not waste any energy and produce our desired extra heat attraction.\n  Additional Heat Generation\n  Spectral Attraction (CCFL/UV Color)  \nThe light that a CCFL light produces attracts mosquitoes since it has been adjusted to give off the same body heat of human body\u2019s. The light itself also emits a special spectrum that attracts mosquitoes and other flying insects. \nA CCFL light can last up to 40.000+ hours in comparison to the traditional UV lights that people still use from decades ago, there is no need to exchange the light bulbs anymore. Another interesting thing is that a CCFL light uses 60% less energy than the traditional UV bulbs. \nMosquito Spectrum\n  CCFL Light\n  at Night\n  Biogents Attractants  (Optional Attractants)\nResearchers of Biogents (University of Regensburg / Germany) have over 16 years of research regarding the olfactory system of mosquitoes. \nWe have implemented their sweet scent attractants into our traps. With the following results as seen below. \nOur Mosquito Box can function without the optional attractants. If you include the attractants into your trap, you can increase the trapping efficacy.\n  Lab Testing\n  Our Mosquito Testing Box\n  Trapping Efficacy\nCapturing Mosquitoes\nThe Mosquito Box has a fan for two purposes. The fan acts as a suction device to suck in mosquitoes that are attracted to the Mosquito Box.\nThe second function is to make sure that the Co2/H2o that is generated can be spread out.\nFans of the MBOX\n  Capturing Tray\n  The Mosquito Box Usage \nThe Mosquito Box is designed for indoor usage but is also capable functioning outdoors like for your garden/patio or balcony. \nThe MBOX is a specialized device that lures in mosquitoes by offering an alternative for the mosquito, when there are no options available for the mosquito to bite like in your living room or bed room it will be attracted to the trap and captured.\nThe most important aspect is that you have to keep the trap on when there are no alternatives for mosquitoes to guarantee a 100% capture rate.\nCoverage\n  Can be places anywhere\n  Adapters for Any Country\n   Specifications:\n  Specifications\n    Production Timeline:\n  Shipping\n  Shipping Schedule\n A lot of work has already been finished after our first generation of the Mosquito Box. We are looking to expand globally to give everyone a chance to buy a Mosquito Box and protect their family & friends from mosquito borne diseases.\nOnce our finance have been rounded up, we can immediately start producing and shipping our first products after carefully testing them. \nHow the funds will be used. \nOur mission is to develop even better traps in the future that we can provide to the world. If there is any profit, we will dedicate it in research & development to improve our understanding of the mosquito. \nWe will also provide products & methods to areas that need mosquito control the most. We believe that when you are backing us, it is not only helping you to get rid of mosquitoes, but you will also be helping humanity getting rid of mosquitoes.\nWe really have to reduce the amount of deaths by mosquitoes, it is one of the biggest killers of the world and to achieve this we need your help!\nBack us now!\n    PLAY\n\n  Infograph (Gates Notes)\n                                                                                                              Increasing Risks\n                                                                                                              Malaria Risks\n Protecting Your Family & Friends On the Go\nProtect your Garden & Have a BBQ without being bitten!\n  Easily Blend In\n   ", "risks": "", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Calvin Li\nFirst created \u00b7 0 backed\nHi everyone, my email : li.calvin@qmworld.eu My name is Chung Hon Calvin Li.

The reason for this is because the mosquito box is packed in a very sturdy box and it weighs around 1.05kg in total. This makes the shipping a bit more expensive than other kickstarter products. The current prices we have received from ups/dhl/fedex and hong kong couriers are the prices we have on kickstarter. The mbox shipment will take around 5 office days with these couriers world wide.

We have launched a new campaign titled\n\"Rebel: World's 1st Certified Tri-Connector Charging Cable\"\nPlease visit the campaign here. Please back us and thank you for your support.\nPython is the world\u2019s first charging cable with Tough Kevlar\u00ae Reinforced Braided PVC Skin for superior strength and a lifetime warranty.\nPython is Universal, Certified, Strong, Fast, Durable, Reliable and Lasting. \nPython cables are available in several dynamic lengths. Python is the world\u2019s longest Apple MFi certified cable. \nWe stand behind our product 100% and back it with a lifetime warranty. \n Not the least expensive, not the most but far better than other cables costing a lot more and simply delivers lasting value.\nOver 10,000-user tested and recommended \nThe Python Family of Cables:\nStop wasting your money on weak flimsy and gimmicky uncertified cables that don\u2019t last. Meet the Python Charging Cable, the world\u2019s first dual charging cable with Tough Kevlar\u00ae Reinforced Braided PVC Skin for superior strength and a lifetime warranty.\nWe have put together a host of amazing perks with a flat shipping fees of only $10 for any reward anywhere in the world. So please make a pledge with just a few clicks then share with all of your friends and join our mission to create the strongest, fastest, most durable, most reliable and lasting Charging Cable Ever.\nHow to select multiple cables\nLast June, having been fed up with wasting money on weak flimsy and gimmicky uncertified cables that don\u2019t last, we launched the Python cable, the world\u2019s first charging cable with Tough Kevlar\u00ae Reinforced Braided PVC Skin for superior strength and backed it with a lifetime warranty.\nThen we followed with the Python USB-C Quick Charge 3.1 IF-Certified with Thunderbolt-3 support cable to a rave review.\nWhen we developed the Python Kevlar-reinforced charging cables last year and backed it with a lifetime warranty, we had no idea that so many would copy our idea and include Kevlar in their cables. But there is more to what makes Python the superior cable that it is. A lot more! We have also learned a lot in the past many months and have made great changes to the Python cable. The result is strength, resistance and durability in a charging cable to last a lifetime.\nPython cables are the fastest cables ever and are the world\u2019s longest MFi and USB-IF certified cables and all are backed with our stunning customer service too.\nWhat makes Python so strong is the DuPont Kevlar\u00ae Reinforced braided PVC throughout the cable. What is Kevlar? It's the stuff that bulletproof vests are made of. It is the most powerful and strongest material in the world.\n Why PVC and Kevlar?\nWhile Kevlar has very high tensile or pulling strength, it has very poor compressive strength (resistance to squashing or squeezing) and combining both Kevlar and PVC together offers us an unmatched strength, flexibility and durability.\n Now all of our usb-a (standard usb) cables are available in dual connectors. The Short, the Stock, the Long. Your choice to select: Micro USB + Lightning or Micro USB + USB Type-C. You can also select a single connector in Micro USB, Lightning or USB Type-C. Enjoy!\nWe know you don\u2019t always have a lot of time to charge your devices that\u2019s why we engineered Python cables to charge your devices at the speed of light. It is up to twice as fast as regular charging cables, which allows you to top-off your battery quickly during those times you\u2019re away from the wall. \nMany cheaper cables go with thinner wires to cut cost, and they can\u2019t handle enough current to charge newer, power-hungry devices at full speed. A cheaply made cable can also hamper data-transfer speeds. The many leading brands cables we tested had 19% slower data-read speeds than Python, and the slowest-charging cable conducted 41% less current than the Python cable.\nPLAY\n\nBuying after market USB cables will pretty much always result in getting cheap quality 30/30 cables and your device will barely break 500mAh when it charges, maybe even less. This isn't the only issue though. After you use a cable for a while it eventually stress near the plugs and causes poor connectivity between your device and the wire.\nPython cables Use 18AWG silver-plated copper cables for lower resistance and faster charging than any other cable out there and offer high speed charging at 3.1A, 3.2v - 20v & 18W and data sync up to 10Gbps and our new Python USB-IF Certified USB-C to USB-C Quick Charge 3.1 Generation 2 cable with up to 40 gigabits per second and 100 watts of power, gain support for Thunderbolt 3, and benefit from the ability to simultaneously connect to two 4K 60 Hertz display or one 5K 60 Hertz display. , which would save you a lot of time to do other things...\nOur USB-IF test results for successful certification\nPython was born out of the necessity for a reliable and efficient charging solution, to de-clutter and to de-stress your life! The tough 3M braiding material keep the Python Cable inherently tangle-free.\nPrism Zinc alloy connectors\nPrism is available in silver or gold\nFrom left to right, Sunset & Sunrise Vivid charging cables\nA larger prototype of Corekey.

Share on Facebook   |    Share on Twitter\neto is a beautifully designed wine decanter that gives you the freedom to enjoy wine at your own pace, and never waste a drop again. Its innovative, patented preservation system uses an airtight seal to keep wine perfectly fresh for at least 7 days, as proven by blind taste tests carried out with 'Master of Wine' Richard Hemming, and independent laboratory testing at Bangor University.\neto is easy to use - its unique design ensures every step is quick, clean and complements the traditional ritual of enjoying wine.\nDue to its patented preservation system that creates an airtight seal over the wine, eto halts the oxidation process, which in turn preserves the wine\u2019s freshness and taste. \nAs we become more health-consciousness, more and more of us are choosing to enjoy just a glass or two rather than several \u2013 or even save our wine drinking for the weekend. eto gives us this freedom. \nWith eto you can open and savour that treasured bottle over several days or even weeks. \nThe long funnel gently oxygenates the wine to release its flavours and the sharp lip ensures drip-free pouring. \nNo waste, and no need to rush to finish the bottle (or the next one...)\neto\u2019s ability to prevent wine oxidation has been proven by independent tests carried out at Bangor University. The graph shows just how effective eto is compared to other wine preservation products. \nBeacon Laboratories. \u00a9 Bangor University 2016\neto underwent rigorous testing and re-testing over a 12 month period with a variety of red and white wines. The results were indisputable - eto far out-performed competitor products in every tightly-monitored test.  \nWhile science proved eto prevented oxidation, blind taste tests with wine experts showed that eto protected the quality of the wine too.  \n'Master of Wine' Richard Hemming \u2013 and writer at JancisRobinson.com \u2013 took part in two separate blind taste tests, comparing freshly opened wine with its eto 7 day preserved equivalent.  \u201cOn the seventh day ... for me, the results were unanimous: there was no perceptible difference between a freshly opened bottle and the eto-stored sample\u201d Read the full article HERE.\nAfter taking part in a similar blind taste test, Wine Director at Honest Grapes, Tom Harrow, commented \u201cA wine which had been decanted (into eto) seven days beforehand tasted every bit as fresh as a wine which had come from a recently opened bottle. But it also had the added benefits of decanting, in that the wine was breathing ... it was opening up ... it tasted absolutely delicious.\u201d \nI am Tom Cotton, an award-winning industrial designer with nearly 20 years experience of bringing products from concept to market. I am passionate about protecting the environment, and in 2011 became interested in designing a product that helped to reduce wine wastage.\nWine wastage is a huge environmental problem across the world. In the UK alone, 50 million litres of wine are poured down the sink every year - see WRAP report EVA063. A recent study by Laithwaite\u2019s Wine put the figure down as enough to fill 333 Olympic-sized swimming pools, and also these disturbing statistics: \nOur inability to preserve wine once the cork has been popped is a major cause of this wine waste. And I quickly discovered that the wine preservation products on the market were either ineffective or hugely expensive.\nMy inspiration for eto came after a friend highlighted the method - common amongst wine experts - of transferring leftover wine into a smaller container to minimise the air contact. After experimenting, I found the method of reducing air exposure very effective. I just needed to work on the container\u2026 \nAfter months of exploration I filed a patent for an innovative design in September 2012. At the core of the invention was a new unique valve concept that sealed wine at exactly the right moment, no matter how much wine was left. \nThe \u2018design for manufacture\u2019 stage brought significant challenges. Not only did the valve require costly \u2018proof of concept\u2019 prototyping, experts in the glass industry said the precision required for glass simply couldn\u2019t be achieved within the cost.  \nAfter a highly rigorous and competitive process, I was awarded an Innovate UK government grant to develop eto further. This support proved invaluable, allowing me to build over 60 functioning prototypes, develop a detailed manufacture design and test eto\u2019s effectiveness in the laboratory. \nFive years on, we have a product that really works. eto looks beautiful, preserves wine brilliantly and is exceptionally easy to use, store and maintain.  \nWe have built a strong relationship with our chosen manufacturing partner, and use only the highest quality materials to ensure eto is effective, elegant and durable in the long term. \nAll materials are food approved and fully compliant with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the German BfR, ensuring they have no effect on the wine\u2019s flavour. All materials are also BPA free. \nThe glass used in eto is high precision \u2018toughened\u2019 borosilicate glass that\u2019s optically clear & \u2018seam free\u2019 to optimise the wine colour. The glass has increased heat & shatter resistance, and won't stain or absorb any odours.\nHigh grade Stainless steel with anti-corrosion properties and antimicrobial finish.\nPVD coating creates a tough finish that is approximately ten times harder than stainless steel itself.\neto dissembles into four main sections and these can be individually replaced if damaged. (Although we do not foresee any reason to replace parts due to natural wear & tear.)\nAs glass specification was one of our major challenges, we undertook extensive research before selecting a glass manufacturer who we were confident could achieve the consistent glass tolerance required for eto without spiralling costs. High standards in worker treatment and environmental impact were also essential.  \nWe have worked closely with our manufacturing and assembly partner for over two years. They have over 30 years of experience bringing premium houseware products to market, and their skilled quality control team inspect each product before shipping.\neto has taken several years to perfect, as we have built multiple prototypes to improve and simplify its design. We now have a product with minimal parts, precision-engineered seam-free glass, and high grade, anti-corrosion stainless steel that is both durable and aesthetic.\nBack eto and become part of our story. Once the campaign is over, we will be in touch to collect your shipping address details. We will then keep you updated throughout the process, and you will become one of the first people to enjoy using eto in early 2018. \neto is a unique and innovative product, and would make a great gift for any wine drinker. If you would like to buy eto for someone special, simply download the \u2018gift card\u2019 (from the link below) which can be printed, or sent electronically. \neto is easy to clean \u2013 simply rinse with hot water straight after use and avoid using detergents. Please note, the metal parts of eto are not dishwasher safe. \nTo make eto viable, we need to raise \u00a355,000 through our Kickstarter campaign. This diagram shows you how your money will be allocated. Any additional funds will be used to increase production. \neto's creator Tom Cotton is an award winning industrial designer with nearly 20 years experience creating 3D product & packaging designs for some of the world\u2019s leading brands. He has a passion for delivering fresh, breakthrough designs that reflect a high-level of consumer and market understanding, and has a strength for balancing design and technology constraints, often working through tough issues until they are resolved.   \nTom is cited as \u2018inventor\u2019 on over 18 international patents for consumer products, and has been extensively involved in the development and commercialisation of IP. His enthusiasm for innovation and problem solving is balanced by a detailed understanding of manufacturing, materials, IP & business realities. He\u2019s created structural pack forms and product designs for clients including Gillette, Diageo, Procter & Gamble, Absolute vodka, Bacardi and Nestle.\nPLAY\n\n Easy to use - even by a 3 year old :)\nI am a London based Welshman and, like many of my countrymen, proud of my roots. The word eto means \u2018again\u2019 in Welsh, which perfectly sums up the joy of the product. eto allows you to enjoy wine again, and again \u2013 without sacrificing either its taste or our planet.\nKickstarter is a proven start-up platform with a community of \u2018early adopters\u2019 who help vet, fund and refine new products. For innovative entrepreneurs who want to realise their vision, the pioneering Kickstarter community offers the most supportive platform. We highly value the Kickstarter community and its role in supporting innovation and hope that together we can launch eto. We\u2019re not on Kickstarter to make a big margin; we\u2019re here to build a community of early adopters who can also help us decide what eto will do next.  \nJoin us in bringing this collaboration to life \u2013 we can't do it without you!\nWe couldn\u2019t have created eto without the help and support of friends and family, all of whom who have encouraged us to launch our new product on Kickstarter.

We love playing cards, but we couldn\u2019t really find anything that was quite suited for our minimalist way of traveling. When you travel as much as we do, you don\u2019t want to carry anything extra around. Every item makes a difference. We\u2019re big fans of improvement, and decided to create the ultimate playing cards for travelers. The making of the Air Deck has taken us through several countries, and we\u2019ve met many wonderful people along the way. Now we have the prototype ready and we\u2019re proud of the result. Meet our new travel companion, the Air Deck. The world's first truly travel optimized playing cards!\nThe Air Deck team\nKey Features:\n52 Playing Cards + 2 jokers\nWaterproof and washable\nPremium printing with a protective matte varnish\nMade from extra durable premium PVC\nSlightly textured back, smooth front \nSturdy deluxe matte tuck box \nPlaying card size : 3.43 x 1.26 inches (87 x 32mm)\nPerks:\nFree world-wide shipping\nFree PDF \u201cCard games from around the world\u201d\nOption to buy the Air Deck in white color\nHere's a mock-up of how the Air Deck will look in red color.\n  With the Air Deck with you can play everywhere anytime. It fits easily on small surfaces, such as a plane tray table.\n  Regular paper playing cards tear, stain, bend and break easily, but we've designed the Air Deck to be extremely durable.\nQuality\nWhile we wanted a compact and light deck, we didn't want to compromise on quality. We went to several of the world\u2019s manufacturers of premium casino cards and asked for the best materials they could provide. In the process of creating the ultimate travel deck, we tried out over 50 different high end plastic materials. The materials were taken through  scratch, bending and handling tests to identify the best candidate. Finally we ended up with a premium \u2018casino quality\u2019 PVC that has all the properties we want.\nThe cards have a premium feel to them.\n  The Air Deck is designed to be brought anywhere. It takes up very little space and easily fits into your pocket.\nThe Air Deck is incredibly resistant to tearing and bending, and it\u2019s totally waterproof. You can play with these in the pool, in the boat, in the tub, in the rain, at the beach, pretty much wherever you can think of.\nThe cards are 100% waterproof, so you can even use them in the pool or the bathtub.\n  The cards are washable. Liquids and dust rinse off easily.\n  The Air Deck is a surefire convesation starter.\nHandling\nIn the process of selecting the material we sought advice from several playing card professionals, to help us find the optimal material and design. The end result a deck that shuffles and handles like you expect professional cards to do. The cards are slightly textured on the back, while the front is plain. This provides excellent handling and a good grip.\nThe Air Deck shuffles easily\n  Our goal was to make the Air Deck both visually interesting and simple to read.\nDesign\nWe\u2019ve worked hard to create a fitting minimalist design for the Air Deck. For us, it was key that the cards are uncluttered, symmetrical and easy to read. We also wanted to create something fun and \u2018out-of-the- ordinary\u2019. The Air Deck\u2019s unique design will no doubt act as a conversation starter on your travels. The deck consists of 52 playing cards + 2 jokers and measures 87mm X 32mm. Despite the smaller footprint we\u2019ve retained all the features of standard decks. The length ensures that it handles much like a full size deck, and the narrower width makes the deck fit nicely in the palm of your hands.\nJack, queen, king and ace of hearts.\n  The Air Deck comes with a solid tuck box. It's laminated for extra protection and features spot UV printing.\n For this campaign we\u2019re offering the cards in two different colors; black and white.\nThe Air Deck in black color\n  The Air Deck in white color.\n  The Air Deck in red color\nWe hope that you are as excited about the Air Deck as we are. Support our project, and give yourself, or someone you care about, the perfect playing cards for traveling.\nAdd a nice view to your game.\n  The Air Deck is incredibly strong and flexible.\n   ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe do not anticipate any major challenges to this project, and we promise to stay transparent and update you every step of the way. \n\nMuch of the work is already done. The design phase of the cards is finalized and we\u2019ve made the prototype you see in the video. We\u2019ve had personal meetings with the manufacturer and agreed on all details, and we've gotten several quotes for fulfillment and shipping from reliable partners. We're ready to go! :) \n\nNow we just need your support so that we can afford to print the first batch of decks.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support":

It's fun, addicting, easy-to-learn, and while you're playing, you discover how computers work.\nI'm all about teaching kids to code. When I was a professor at the University of Minnesota, I saw how valuable it is for all students to be coders. I have three young kids and I've tried all sorts of games to build their interest in coding. The problem is that they all treat computers like abstract, black boxes. They overlook the fundamental, most amazing concept: how simple switches, connected together in clever ways, can do incredibly smart things.\nKids learn best when they use their senses to explore concepts. Turing Tumble is the only game that lets kids see and feel how computers work. The logic isn\u2019t hidden inside a computer chip \u2013 it\u2019s all right there in front of them. It builds logic and critical thinking skills, fundamental coding concepts, and grounds their understanding of computers. \nAnd adults, this game is not just for kids! \nIt's a game unlike any you've ever played. It takes creative thinking to come up with a solution to each puzzle - you can't just stumble across the solution by trial and error - and it's extremely gratifying to build it and watch it work. Even if you're an expert programmer, I guarantee you'll find the latter puzzles a challenge.\nThe Game\n Turing Tumble comes with 105 parts:  \n1 game board\n1 game board stand\n30 ramps\n10 bits  \n8 gear bits  \n6 crossovers  \n4 gears  \n3 interceptors  \n1 presser \n20 red marbles\n20 blue marbles  \n1 puzzle book\nTuring Tumble has 105 parts in all\nHow it works\nThe game board releases one marble at a time from the top. Each marble falls down the board and when it reaches the bottom, it pushes down one of two black flippers at the bottom that release another ball. If it pushes down the left flipper, a blue ball is released. If it pushes down the right flipper, a red ball is released.\nPlayers add logic by putting 6 different types of parts onto the board:\nThe ramp directs balls in one direction, either to the left or to the right.\nThe \"ramp\"\nThe crossover lets ball paths cross over one another. Balls come in one side and exit on the opposite side.\nThe \"crossover\"\nThe bit adds logic. It stores information by pointing to the right or to the left, like a 1 or 0. It becomes more and more important as the puzzles progress.\nThe \"bit\"\nWhen the computer\u2019s objective is complete, the interceptor is used to stop the computer from releasing any more balls.\nThe \"interceptor\"\nLike the bit, the gear bit stores information by pointing right or left, but when the gear bit is flipped, it also turns other gear bits connected to it by gears. \nThe \"gear bit\" and \"gear\"\nThe gear bits are mind-bending, but they add a whole new level of functionality to the board. They also make the computer \"Turing complete\", which means that if the board was big enough, it could do anything a regular computer could do!\nTuring Tumble comes with a book of 51 puzzles. They start out easy and become steadily more challenging. Each puzzle leads the player to discover new concepts that can be applied to more complicated puzzles later on. The puzzles are woven into a 20-page comic story, beautifully illustrated by Jiaoyang Li, where each puzzle brings Alia the space engineer closer to rescue from a seemingly deserted planet. Jiaoyang is a senior at the University of Minnesota, majoring in both art and computer science. This will hopefully be her first published artwork. \n\"I've had the chance to preview the material with my 8 and 10 year old children and they loved the story-based approach. The graphics are very high quality and the story is fast-paced and engaging. The puzzles do a great job of showing how you can build complex systems from simple building blocks.\" -- Dr Tracy Gardner, Director Tech Age Kids\nHow to Play\nThe goal of each puzzle is to build a computer that completes an objective. For example, here's challenge #1:\nChallenge #1\nThe objective of this puzzle is to make all of the blue balls (and only the blue balls) reach the end.\nYou begin by building the starting setup. \nPuzzle 1 starting setup\nYour job is to figure out where to put the parts listed under \"Add to board\" in order to complete the objective. It tells you to add four green ramps to the board...but where? Here's what happens when you run it with just the starting setup:\nPLAY\n\nWithout those four green ramps, it doesn't work at all - there's nothing to catch balls coming off the third ramp down, so they fall freely and bounce all over the place. And it doesn't complete the objective, since sometimes red balls reach the end, too.\nCan you think of the solution?\nTo solve this puzzle, place the four ramps in such a way that they complete the path from the top of the board to the bottom of the board. \nHere it is running:\nPLAY\n\nWay to go!\nWhat Kinds of Things Can It Do?\nThe Turing Tumble mechanical computer can do all sorts of things. It can:\ncount\nadd\nsubtract\nmultiply\ndivide\ncompare numbers\nit can do logic\nit can create patterns  \n\u2026and much more \nHere are a few examples...\nExample 1:\nThis computer is the solution to puzzle 11, where the objective is to create a computer that generates the pattern: blue, blue, red, red, blue, blue, red, red\u2026\nPLAY\n\nExample 2:\nWhen you reach puzzle 19, binary numbers are introduced into the puzzles. In the following picture, a number is represented by four bits. To read the number from the bits, all you have to know is that the top bit is worth 1, the second bit down is worth 2, the third bit is worth 4, and the fourth bit is worth 8. Simply add together the values of the bits that are pointed right. For example,\nThe numbers 0 through 8 are shown in binary. To read them, add the value of the bits pointed right.\nNow, here\u2019s a computer that counts up to 8 in binary. You can ignore the other parts, just watch those four bits.\nPLAY\n\nExample 3:\nHere's one of the more difficult puzzles. The goal of this puzzle is to create a pattern that starts with a group of 2 blue balls, then a group of 4 blue balls, and then a group of 8 blue balls, with each group separated by a single red ball.\nPLAY\n\nStretch goals\nStretch goal #1 ($150,000 - reached!): We\u2019ve heard from many of you that with kids at home or in classrooms, it's important to be able to glance at the box and see that all the pieces are accounted for. If total funding reaches $150,000, we'll upgrade the box insert to a vacuum molded insert with shaped holes for the individual parts. \nStretch goal #2 ($200,000 - reached!): We think it's important that the Turing Tumble box is sturdy enough to stand up to repeated use. Both at home and in a classroom setting. If total funding reaches $200,000, we will upgrade the box to a premium design with a magnetic latch, and we'll make it out of thicker cardboard. \nStretch goal #3 ($250,000 - reached!): Sometimes you just need a little extra help. We'll put hints to each of the puzzles online. This is in addition to the solutions that are already in the back of the book.\nStretch goal #4 ($300,000 - reached!): Four extra red balls and four extra blue balls in every copy. By now, we've probably got a full set of balls hiding under our fridge. And our couch.\nStretch goal #5 ($350,000 - reached!): Stand upgrade! We'll give the stand adjustable tilt so you can speed up or slow down your computer. Might need to add a CPU cooling fan if you get it going too fast. :)\nStretch goal #6 ($400,000): This is the big one. Can we reach it? If we can hit this stretch goal, I'll create *9* more puzzles \u2013 up to 60! We'll also make an educator\u2019s version of the puzzle book online, and we'll create a website where you can share your own puzzles/creations.\nInternational Shipping\nGood news! We have enough backers that we can import Turing Tumble into several countries and pay customs fees ourselves. Check the FAQ to see a list of the countries that will not have to pay VAT. \nThe cost of international shipping is reduced by $10 for our international backers (excluding Canada)! See this update for more information.\nCreating Turing Tumble\nI spent a good part of the last two years designing Turing Tumble. I started by attempting to make it something like a board game version of the wonderful browser-based game, Manufactoria, where you build Turing machines to sort objects and create patterns. It wasn\u2019t long before I ran into the same problem other programming board games have\u2014if your program has more than a few instructions, it becomes a long, tedious process to run it by hand, and the person running it is prone to error\u2014especially because they\u2019re the one who made the program in the first place.\nI knew the game had to be able to run the programs itself, and that\u2019s when I started looking into mechanical computers. An old toy from the 1960\u2019s came up in my searches\u2014the Digi-Comp II. The Digi-Comp II was probably the first mechanical computer powered by marbles. It was a great place to start, but I still had a long way to go. It wasn\u2019t programmable, it wasn\u2019t Turing complete, and it wasn\u2019t a game. \nI began by creating a system where parts could be placed anywhere on the board to program the computer. The first part I created was the bit. I thought a simple T-shaped part (a) would do the trick, but I 3D printed it and found that it didn\u2019t. When it was angled at 45 degrees, the ball sat directly on top of its rotational axis, so there was no force to rotate the part. I played with the shape, size, weight, balance, and surface friction, and eventually arrived at a working design (g). However, when I altered the design to make it injection-mold-friendly and CNC milled it (h), it became too light and bouncy. A ball would flip it one way, and it would bounce right back the other way again. I made a few more adjustments and finally arrived at (i).\nDevelopment of the bit\nThe ramp was the next part I designed. I thought it would be easy, but a simple ramp (a, b) didn\u2019t work at all. If two or more ramps were placed in a row, balls got going too fast, and by the time they hit another part, they\u2019d bounce off the board. To slow the balls, I tried all sorts of things, but eventually arrived at a counterweight system (c) that carried through to the final version (f).\nDevelopment of the ramp\nThe crossover was another tricky part. At first, I tried to make it like a tube that took a ball over another part and back down on the other side (a). But since the only part that could fit behind it was the ramp, the next version had a ramp built in (b). It worked well enough, but it stuck too far out of the board, leaving no room for the gear bits. The next version was flat (c), then more reliable (d), and then injection-mold-friendly (e and f).\nDevelopment of the crossover\nI tried a few different approaches to make bits that could turn each other. Eventually I arrived at a design using gears. I found that the gear bits had to be balanced differently than the bits. Bits needed extra weight at the top of the part so that after it flipped it had some weight to keep it there. Gear bits, on the other hand, needed to be balanced because the extra weight on top became too much when, say, three gear bits were connected together. The later designs had equal weight on top and bottom.\nDevelopment of the gear bit\nThe interceptor was, as you might expect, the easiest part to make. The first was 3D printed (a), and the final version was CNC milled and compatible with injection molding (b).\nDevelopment of the interceptor\nThe game board also went through several iterations. At first, I 3D printed a test board with just 6 places to insert parts (a). As the parts evolved, the test board did, too. By the time I created test board (e), things were working well, so I designed a complete game board (f). I had it 3D printed elsewhere since my 3D printer wasn't nearly big enough. I used that game board a lot to continue improving the reliability of the parts and to do beta testing. Then I designed a final, injection-mold-friendly version and made it by CNC milling (g).\nDevelopment of the game board\nHow will the funding be used?\nThis game has a higher funding goal than most tabletop games because of the large number (and size) of plastic parts - it's sort of like a LEGO set, but without the massive quantities that would normally bring costs down. The injection molds for the 14 different plastic parts will require the majority of the funding goal. The rest of the funding will go to per-game costs for 75 plastic parts, 40 painted balls, 30 stainless steel counterweights, a 100+ page booklet, and packaging. A small fraction will be left for unforeseen costs.\nSpecial thanks for the wonderful articles!\nPopular Mechanics: This Brilliant Mechanical Computer Is Built for Gaming\nBoing Boing: Cool marble-powered mechanical computer to solve logic problems\nTechCrunch: The Turing Tumble lets you and your kids build real mechanical computers\nThe Mac Observer: Turing Tumble on Kickstarter Has Kids Building Mechanical Computers\nGeekDad: Kickstarter Alert: Program a Mechanical Computer With \u2018Turing Tumble\u2019\nTech Age Kids: Turing Tumble: Gaming on a Mechanical Computer\nThe Toy Insider: Turing Tumble Has Potential to Create a Coder in Everyone\nEngaged Family Gaming: Kickstarter Preview: Turing Tumble\nThe Laughing Squid: The Turing Tumble, A DIY Mechanical Computer Powered by Marbles That Solve Puzzles of Logic", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nBesides some cosmetics, the game is fully designed, so there is relatively little risk. The change to injection mold manufacturing introduces some risk. Though the parts are already designed to be compatible with injection molding, it may be that the when parts are made with this new process, they have a different balance or need to otherwise be adjusted to meet tolerance requirements. These types of things could cause delay or additional cost, but of course as a Kickstarter backer, the additional cost would not be passed on to you.\n\nIf the project is fully backed here on Kickstarter, we will likely work with Panda Game Manufacturing to create the first production run (for everything except the injection molded parts).

Being lightweight is every serious cyclist's goal-to be able to go further on your ride without being weighed down by gear.\nThe Cyclist Card is a two part multi-tool made to fulfill the need to fix or adjust your bike at a moments notice. It's compact, and can handle almost any adjustment\u2014from setting your seat, to straightening a bent disc brake.\nFeatured On:\n Cool Cleveland, Brenmi, Everyday Carry, Gear Shout, The Coolector, Geeky Gadgets, Gear Hungry, Traction Life, HiConsumption\nThe Cyclist Card is designed with our favorite high end blade steel: CPM S35VN. We had a wonderful response to the toughness, edge retention, and reliability this material brought to our flagship multi-tool, the EDC Card. We\u2019ve loved what you, the backers, had to say about it, so we decided to use it again for this design.\nCPM S35VN Blade Steel\nS35VN is a hard-wearing, high-end stainless blade steel designed to be as strong as possible without sacrificing edge retention, corrosion resistance, or machine-ability. The usage of this steel requires state of the art processes. It must be heat treated in a vacuum for uniformity, then cryogenically tempered multiple times for maximum durability and strength. Up to 58-60 HRC (Rockwell Hardness).\nWhy Don\u2019t We Use Titanium?\nWe decided to stay away from titanium for usage in a hand tool. Titanium is a strong material, but it's much softer than S35VN. We\u2019ve used S35VN because it brings a great balance of heft, strength, and longevity that titanium just doesn't have at this volume of material.\nAfter two years of heavy use with our flagship card tool, we still haven't been able to make a dent in the steel. S35VN has proven its value!\nFunctionality\nThe credit card shape and size of the Cyclist Card makes it easy to carry with you on your ride in your wallet, saddle bag, pocket or keys.\nThe Cyclist Card has 43+ functions designed to cover your bases of preparedness for your ride on the road or trail.\nIncluded tools:\nTire pry \n15mm, 13mm, 10mm, standard hex wrenches\nTwo advanced hex wrench bodies capable for all size hexes: 3mm to 17mm ( or 1/8\"- 43/64\u201d). Twenty-nine wrenches total. Useful for vintage bikes and elsewhere.\nThree spoke wrenches: 3.23mm, 3.3mm, 3.45mm\nTruing fork to straighten bent disc brakes\nMillimeter measure\n#2 Philips and 3/16\" X 1/32\" flat head drivers \n1/4\" hex wrench. Doubles as modular bit system. Holds 1/4\" bits.\nPorts for auxiliary tool \nThe all-important bottle opener\nThe Cyclist Card is designed to be as functional as it\u2019s compact form will allow. It can handle most fixes, but is not meant to replace an Allen or Torx multi-tool set. That's why we designed a separate auxiliary tool to be used in tandem for multiple extra functions.\nThe Auxiliary Tool\nThe Auxiliary Tool is an additional accessory that gives you the ability to extend the leverage capabilities of the Cyclist Card. It also allows you to replace your Allen key multi-tool set by utilizing a retainer space to carry two 1/4\" bits to replace Allen or Torx keys where needed.\nThe Auxiliary Tool is made with 17-4PH steel. A high-grade, corrosion-resistant, stainless steel used in helicopter parts and knife-making. \nUnique Features - Cyclist Card System\nFirst of it's kind made with S35VN blade steel \nUpgraded tooth hex wrenches for superior range of use. This type of hex wrench grips a wider range of hexes than traditional types.\nModular: Utilizes 1/4\" hex bit shanks + Auxiliary Tool for extra leverage w/ bit containers. \nTSA Compliant: No sharp edges & under 4\u201d long.\nCan be used handheld or with Auxiliary Tool extension for maximum torque.\n\nThe Cyclist Card isn't limited to just bikes, It works around the house too.\nAfter developing the EDC Card with Tofty, I was surprised by how often I found myself reaching for the card. I began to fully appreciate its high functionality and was inspired to create something as convenient and user-friendly\u2026inspired by a great childhood pastime\u2026riding a bike. If you ride long distances or are fastidious in your biking credo, chances are, you\u2019ll do what you can to carry less so you don't wear yourself out. The Cyclist Card fits that bill and I wanted to bring that to life.\n\nI was inspired to create the Cyclist Card following on the heels of what the EDC Card came to be: A complete and reliable asset with its military grade steel and unique composition of tools. Like the EDC Card, the Cyclist Card is the first of its kind to be manufactured with high quality S35VN blade steel and the first purpose-built card tool for cyclists. I set out to create a high quality tool that you can rely on for years to come. \nExecution Plan\nWe're almost there. We\u2019ve created prototypes to ensure with thorough testing that the Cyclist Card works. We have excellent manufacturers who make quality products in a timely fashion, and we are dedicated to bringing you a quality product - no exceptions.\nWe need your help to bring the Cyclist Card to a full production run. Pledges will enable us to purchase material, pay for manufacturing, shipping, and minimal packaging.\nIf we\u2019re able to acquire sufficient funding, we\u2019ll begin the manufacturing process as soon as this project comes to a close. Our priority is to get these packed and shipped out to you, our pledgers, by Spring 2016.\nConservation Through Quality Design\nI believe in making products that last a lifetime. It\u2019s been my goal since the beginning of Cha-O-Ha Design Co.\nIn order to protect our environment, I believe it\u2019s important to create products with the intent of longevity and producing less waste throughout the production process - from sourcing and crafting to finish. In every step we are mindful to create as little waste as possible within our limitations, and we are looking to the horizon to create even less waste in the future.\nAbout Cha-O-Ha Design Co.\n\"Cha-O-Ha\" is derived from the Lakota Native American language. It means, to be among the trees, or at one with nature. We specialize in handmade & precision crafted, utilitarian goods. At CHA / O / HA Design Co., we exhibit particularity in design and detail and use the best quality, hardest-working unique materials.

We could not implement these improvements in a timely fashion to bring to the Kickstarter platform.\nWe have developed the Cyclist Card up to a 2.2 Version, as seen here in the project. In full disclosure to our pledgers \u2014 Products shipped will be a slightly updated version 3.0 series with these minor improvements:\nWe promise these minor changes will not affect the overall outcome of the product: The changes are strictly performance based, and will strengthen the structural integrity of the Cyclist Card - to provide a better quality product that will last longer. You will get the product you are expecting! \nOn top of that, as with all our manufactured goods, we include a full lifetime guarantee from manufacturer defects or breakage. If your Cyclist Card were to break, simply send us your product back and we will replace it.\nThank you for your understanding.\nCha-O-Ha Team - Tyler Lacor & Peter Chapman\nCustom Pledge Instructions - How To\nSo you would like to add another product to your already selected pledge?

What an amazing month it has been.  We are so happy to see that our vision for a larger Kindling Cracker is shared by so many, and we look forward to shipping your Kindling Crackers to you soon!\nEveryone else that would like to buy our Kindling Crackers, you can find us at the below links.\nwww.kindlingcracker.com\nwww.kindlingcracker.com/pages/buynow\nhttps://www.facebook.com/KindlingCracker\n Welcome back to our Kindling Cracker King Take 2 Relaunch.\nApologies for muffing our first campaign, but we didn\u2019t anticipate that Kickstarter would generate so much commercial interest behind the scenes. The Insider story really generated a huge amount of orders for us and it meant we took our eye off our 1st campaign at the crucial halfway point. Hopefully this relaunch makes it up to everyone who backed us. \nYou\u2019ll all be receiving your KING now and because of the interest in it we\u2019ve been able to continue the tooling and are ready to roll.\nOur story\nHi I'm Ayla, my story began in 2012 when I was just 13 years old. I needed a science project for school. As I watched my mum turning firewood into kindling with a hatchet, the hatchet slipped and cut her finger, and so began my adventure of finding a better and safer way to cut kindling.  The resulting school project was my invention, the Kindling Cracker!  After a lot of hard work and determination the Kindling Cracker is now an award winning product that is available worldwide.  \nIf you haven't heard of a Kindling Cracker, it is a safer and easier way of cutting kindling. Instead of swinging a sharp object, you swing a blunt one.\nIt is so simple to use! Just rest a piece of wood on top of the blade, gently tap to 'bed' the wood to the blade, take hands away and hit firmly until wood splits! EASY!\nSafe and Easy\n\nIt is the perfect companion for your backyard stack of firewood, creating perfect kindling for your fireplace, fire pit, pizza oven, sauna, barbecue or smoker. \nSome Key features are:\nSafe, easy and Fun to use   \nDurable, Made in Australia of high-quality cast iron\nVirtually maintenance-free\nBolt holes for permanent mounting\nGreat for indoor or outdoor use\nSo why am I on Kickstarter?  \nPeople with longer and wider firewood need a larger Kindling Cracker. This has opened the market for me to create a bigger Kindling Cracker.\nWe have done all the designing, made the tooling, done trials and are currently designing all of the packing. Kick-starter is awesome! People can get amazing deals on new products and help the product or idea get off the ground. One of the rewards I am offering is 90 collectible units which will be embossed with First Edition. The sales of these awesome units, and any other pledges made, will help us get it to market. So, if you would like something really cool that works really well, sign up quickly to get one and help me get this Cracker Cracking!\nNew Tooling is made!\n  Almost twice the size of the original\n  The New Kindling Cracker King Design\nI wanted our new design to be built for the same purpose but also have great feel and look, so who better to ask for some help with the design coverings than Weta Workshop, I bet many of you would have heard of them as they are well known around the world for all their amazing film designs, costumes, creatures, props and weapons, etc. Which have been used for the likes of the Lord of the Rings, The Hobbit , Avatar, and many more. Richard Taylor and his amazing team jumped at the challenge and blew me away with their concepts. Their attention to detail is out of this world!  After Weta workshop did their magic on the product we needed to send the design to our friends at Intercast and Forge (which is the Australian foundry we teamed up with to make my product) The team at Intercast spent weeks tweaking the design to make sure it would work perfectly with the equipment they use, the result was exactly what we were hoping for.... it\u2019s a amazing thing when Art meets Engineering.  \n    The New Kindling Cracker King Dimensions\n  We are Full on making the Kindling Cracker King\n  Feedback about the Original Kindling Cracker \nI can't believe my kindling cracker is still in one piece! I've beaten the living daylights out of this thing since my wife got it for me a couple of Christmases ago. You guys must make these things out of old UFO parts. What is even more amazing is the blade is as sharp as it was the day I got it and I have put a tremendous amount of wood through it. Keep up the great work. These days, it's a privilege to come into contact with a truly superior product. Bill, Grapevine, Texas  \nI just received my Kindling Cracker! Love love love it! So much easier and faster than my hatchet. No strain, just easy breezy! . Lacey  \nBest thing I ever bought!!! . Doug  \nSince I lost my loved husband 6 mths ago the only thing that I was concerned with was losing my fingers or cutting my hand whilst cutting kindling on my lifestyle block. Not using the chainsaw or crutching ewes etc or any maintenance. So today after it arrived whilst raining I managed a barrow load of kindling in 20mins. Such a simple idea Ayla but what a life saver for me. Thank you so much. Joanne.  \nThis amazing tool has take NZ by storm. Everyone with a wood fire should have one, so safe to do to most dangerous job. Even young children could do the task. The story behind it is a modern day fairy story, a fantasy come true. It took a young girl to come up with the idea, well done Ayla. Lesley  \nI gave my 83 year old mother one recently - wow, you should see her go!! She has so much kindling now that I may end up with next year's supply already done for me. She really loves it and I am happy that she is safer than with a little ax. Lindsey  \nGot mine for Christmas. I had given up splitting wood because of torn rotators in both shoulders. This tool makes me smile every time I use it. Easy on the shoulders and works like a charm. Thanks to my family for getting it and Ayla for inventing it. George  \nThank you, love our Kindling Cracker! Does exactly what it is supposed to! So much safer than an axe!

We've also been blindsided more than once by completely unexpected issues and always dealt with them in a way that leaves every last customer happy with their purchase and proud to support our company.\n\nIn short, we know what we're doing, and you should be very confident that we will deliver what we say we will, when we say we will. And we solemnly swear that should unforeseen issues come up, we will handle them with the utmost transparency and care for you, our backers.\n\nSupply Chain Risk: We're incredibly proud of our supply chain, and have a lot of confidence that we can make what we say we'll make, when we say we'll make it.

We pad our schedule for these kind of things, but sometimes not enough.\n\nActs of God: We're based in San Francisco. That means we could have an earthquake.

We couldn\u2019t find a good reason either. While looking for the answer, we did however find several problems with the sunglasses industry that we think really needed to be solved.\n \u2022 AFFORDABILITY: Not $300. Not $200. Not even $100. Our sunglasses are starting at just $35 on Kickstarter. By working direct to consumer, we pass the savings on to you with radical transparency.\n \u2022 PRACTICALITY: We wanted to create a quality handmade pair of sunglasses that\u2019s built to last, but could be used for everyday wear.\n\u2022 DESIGN: They\u2019re beautifully crafted for timelessness with a less-is-more approach, resulting in a classic minimal look that will suit any style.\n  We are a team of product designers, overseas importers, dreamers and marketers who came together on a mission to collectively use our skills to make a difference. Together we created Eye Gave, with the single goal of eliminating trachoma before 2020.\nIt's a simple idea: design a high-end pair of sunglasses, work directly with the factory so we can sell them at a reasonable price, and include the cost of a sight-saving eye operation in the price tag. For every pair you buy, you provide a sight-saving treatment for someone suffering from trachoma.\nAndrew and the youngest member of the team\n  QUALITY & PRICE CONTROL\n We believe high-quality sunglasses shouldn\u2019t come at a high price. Don\u2019t be fooled by the price tag, these glasses are of the same high quality as the sunglasses you see locked away in the glass cabinets at your favorite sports shop. We use the same materials, construction methods and high standards as the big names -- these glasses are made to last. We\u2019ve been using and testing our samples for a couple of months now, and we\u2019re very confident that they aren\u2019t going to break the first time you sit on them in the car.\nBecause we have both designers and Vietnam-based manufacturing experts on our team, we\u2019re able to work directly with the factory and sell directly to you. That means prices that don\u2019t break the bank.\n  High quality solid metal hinges and wire core temples\n The Sunglasses: Product Details\n\nFIT \nBig head, small head, we\u2019ve got you covered. Our sunglasses have a full metal support bar running the length of the temple, so they can be bent and adjusted to fit your head perfectly. No problem.\nIf there is an issue with your sunglasses, just send them back to us and we will take care of you, no questions asked. We want to keep the sunglasses on your head. The more you wear them and show them off, the better for everyone.\nSPECS\nMaterial: 100% black acetate with satin finish\nHinge: Heavy Duty 3 barrel Silver Nickel Hinge with full temple insert. A high quality hinge properly treated to not cause any allergies if in contact with the skin\nLens: Polarized TAC category 3 lens, with 100% UV Protection made from impact resistant polycarbonate. The grey lenses cut light without distorting colors.  \nTemple length: 140mm (5.5 inches) \nLens width: 53mm  (2 inches)\nNose bridge length: 20mm  (0.8 inches) \nTotal width: 135mm\nMade in Vietnam\n \nThe Partnership\nEye Gave and Sightsavers. Two different skill sets, one common mission.\nWe at Eye Gave are product developers, not eye doctors. Sightsavers will be doing the important work they specialize in: performing eye operations, dispensing medication and training locals to examine, treat and support people suffering from trachoma. Meanwhile, we concentrate on building a brand known for its loyalty to charities that do great things and amplifying their name and their work.\nSightsavers is an amazing international organization that changes lives for the long term. They work in more than 30 countries to eliminate avoidable blindness and support people with visual impairments to live independently.\nWhat is Trachoma?\n\u201cTrachoma is probably one of the most neglected diseases in relation to its contribution to global suffering.\u201d Dr. Anthony Solomon, Chief Scientist, Global Trachoma Mapping Project\nTrachoma is an infectious eye disease. It is estimated that 41 million people worldwide, mostly women and children, have active trachoma infection and need treatment. If left alone, trachoma causes the eyelashes to grow inwards towards the eyeball, scratching the cornea and causing extreme pain -- and then blindness.\nBy providing these operations and treatments, we can allow people that are currently being cared FOR to care for others -- helping families function the way they should, allowing parents to go back to work and relieving the strain of having a disease in the family.\nWhere Did It Start?\nThe project started around four years ago as an idea that we could replace an everyday priced item - something that you would buy on a whim like a pair of those terrible sunglasses from the gas station - and do something amazing with it.  As a team, we have used our skills to find a factory, design the glasses, create the branding, build the partnership needed to do the good, and bring it all together for this campaign.\nTimeline\nWe are far enough down the production line to set a firm timeline. If the campaign reaches its goal early, we will commit to the factory and \"OK\" the first sunglasses to be finished and shipped. We are confident that we can start shipping the sunglasses by the end of the campaign. We will be sure to update you on all progress we make and set clear goals.\nOur Team \nAndrew: Design I have a passion for minimal product design. After an amazing Kickstarter campaign last year, I decided to use the know-how from that campaign to try and make a difference.  \n\nRoger: Manufacturing\nI have a passion for starting business that have a strong focus on making the world better. I now live and work in Vietnam, where I am coordinating the manufacturing process of our EyeGave sunglasses. \nErica: Partnerships \nI have realized the unlimited potential for connecting projects with causes that help give back locally and globally. I coordinate our efforts with Sightsavers and manage delivery logistics.\nCatherine: Messaging\nMy background is in marketing and brand messaging, and I'm passionate about helping businesses communicate their message effectively to help further their missions -- especially when that mission is for the greater good!\nThank You\u2019s\nThank you for checking out the campaign. If you have any questions please add a comment to the comments section and we will be happy to help. Even if you can\u2019t back at the level of the sunglasses, please back at the $1 level to stay in-the-know with updates and follow the instructions to share the campaign with the world.\nGetting a product ready for market and creating a campaign like this is a huge undertaking. We have to take some space up here to thank those who have helped us along the way. Christine with Moth To Flame for the video, Sanderson Bob for the wonderful branding, Robin King and all the Sightsavers team, Paula, Margarida and Aymeric for production wisdom, Anemi for the B roll video and Mr. Vi for logistics.\n                  SaveSaveSaveSaveSaveSaveSave", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have been working with the factory in Vietnam for over a year now.

As a team, we're making this our top priority. There are always hiccups along the way, but we do not see any major issues in delivering the sunglasses as promised.

Whether it is competing in Regionals, AMARP, a new Max lift PR or conditioning in the off-season...I got you covered. Literally.\nSay goodbye to bruised and battered shins.\n(Warning: Graphic Imagery Below)\nWhat a simple web search reveals:\nThese armored socks are a unique and innovative solution to an all to common occurrence: Injured Shins.\nNo more grinding, cutting or busting up your shins. Get stronger not injured.\nThanks for your help, Jess Poller\nComprised of the highest tech materials and designed to facilitate any movement where the weight begins on the floor.\nI'm pulling the bar purposely into my shins here.\nProtection from Proper Deadlift Form:\nDeadlift technique:\nHowever you were taught, or weren't taught, there are a few key points of the deadlift that everyone agrees on, besides the fact that that this lift is a necessity. These points are dictated by physics and confirmed by BroScience:\nThe bar will be over your mid-foot. ( Your center of gravity)\n\n The bar will be in physical contact with the leg.\n(If you watch the best lifters closely, you can see the talcum powder flying off their legs as drag the bar up into position... )\n\nProper technique dictates contact with the bar.\nThe shoulders will be forward of the bar.The lower back will be held in normal, rigid extension. \nBar Bell Knurling can cut, scrape and bruise the shins - even through socks.\nUp until now you had only a few choices to protect your shins and none were optimal.\nDuct tape alone or under socks,\nLong Pants ( often hot) \nHigh socks  (often in conjunction with pants) \nHigh socks also tend to be thin which further limits their abrasion protection and are often \"one size fits all\", ironically the weave is pulled thinner on large athletes or any lifter with more muscular calves, providing the strongest with the least...\nNeoprene shin warmers which \"grab\" the bar (an armored shin guard is a stretch goal, should this campaign succeed) and finally the\nOld School method still in use which shows how little innovation has happened - cover your shins and thighs self in baby powder ortalcum to reduce friction...not always practical and always a mess.\nAnother choice, one that I was told to do, and one I found to be since, unacceptable - is just accept scarring and bruises and the risk possible serious infections... ( which happen more often you think at gyms, including Staph infections) \nI don't see the point of building a  physique at the price jacked up, scarred  legs. \nOne of these methods may or may suffice on their own... but if training more than one modality, such as running and lifting for a WOD or metabolic conditioning, then there is no way to be comfortable and protected...until now.\nProtection from Improper Deadlift Form:\nOk, if your setup is lacking, or you are learning, or you have some bad habits or mobility issues these socks will also protect you and help mitigate further injury but these are not meant to replace bad form, in fact the shin armor may allow better feedback to improve technique and function as teaching aid and help with finding the groove you wanted all along.\nProtection from Improper Oly Form:\nAMRAPS, Sets of 90% Maxes, True Maxes, improper hydration, you name it the reasons are endless why your form will invariably suffer, sometimes.. \nUnlike the Deadlift, on the Olympic lifts if you banging your shins there is problem with your technique... however if you are learning, just pushing yourself and your capabilities or working beyond technical failure - you still want these. \nBecause Box Jumps. These socks will help mitigate any injuries from these and other physical activities involving impact / or rope burns:  OC / Spartan races, Mountain Biking, MotoCross, Skateboarding...\nArmor Plated. The first line of defense. Breathable, flexible armor, low friction.\nThese innovative socks are specially designed with laminate armor to provide shin protection that is without parallel. Deadlift, Snatch or Clean for PRs or AMARP with confidence.\nThe armor is comprised of thousands of precisely positioned guard platelets and epoxy resin coating to provide a flexible barrier from abrasion, scuffs, and scrapes \u2013 the armor was initially designed by Higher Dimension Materials, Inc to offer protection against stabs (as in knife attacks\u2026) so it is guaranteed to offer protection from even from the gnarliest barbell knurling.\n The armor plates in this highly innovative and precisely engineered material are flexible, breathable and quick drying.\nLow Friction\nAdditionally the armor provides a low friction environment to facilitate pulls and up your max, as proper deadlift form has you pulling the barbell up your legs you are not just pulling against gravity \u2013 but also friction. \n\nClose up:\nA Truly Super Fabric.\nI tested and researched many different materials and designs, sourced from tactical, military, aerospace industries worldwide and fabric even designed for NASA, before being referred to Higher Dimensions, Inc. I remain extremely impressed by the properties of this \"Armor.\" \nLook at the examples below:\nThis material is pretty bad ass: here is a link involving a live Rattlesnake.\n\nAnd here is a link demonstrating its appeal in industrial settings. This is a longer video, however the Armor depicted is same as offered here. \nPadded. A second layer of protection\nJust the right amount of material and helps protect against the barbell cutting and bruising your shins. Robust enough offer protection against rope burns and even missed box jumps, light and thin enough you won\u2019t notice it is there. \n Innovative Sock Design. Designed for lifters.\nProprietary blend of fibers woven in sock offer even more functionality\nAbrasion resistant fibers\n\nLow friction zone to facilitates pulls\n\nCooling / Wicking properties \n\nAnti odor and Antimicrobial\nInnovative, performance and strength promoting design \nTightly woven knit prevents barbell knurling from catching\n\nOver the Calf Length for protection\n\nCooling / Wicking properties \n\nErgonomic left and right foot designs, promotes stability.\n\nVentilated mesh areas\n\nArch Support and secure fit for comfort \n\nCushioning at heel and toes to minimize impact and maximized shock absorption\n\nAwesomeness", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI did the heavy lifting early.

I started cutting down trees and clearing the rocky site to build a home for my wife and me, to enjoy our retirement. Very soon I got angry on traditional axes, because they were so dangerous and hard to work with. The axe struck me more than once. I had to swing the axe high over my head to build up enough speed to split those fresh logs and eventually this activity started to give me back pain.\nYears and years went by and numerous ideas began to take shape. One day I was levering yard stones with a crowbar and then it struck me \u2013 I finally knew the answer to my problem! I was sure that crowbar\u2019s prying power over big rocks and stumps could be also applied to an axe. I threw the crowbar into the bushes, ran to the kitchen and started to sketch out my new lever-based axe.\nI realized my plans by making numerous prototypes of my axe at a local steel workshop. Prototype by prototype I developed new features to make my invention safer and more effective. Finally I got to this combination of beautiful design and incomparable functionality.\nNow, together with my team, we have managed to make a small production batch. However, to produce on a larger scale, we require expensive production tooling. This far the feedback from users has been amazing! And most importantly, there have been no accidents with Leveraxe since we started selling them.\nRecently, we started thinking how could we make more of these axes and how to make more people happy with this axe. We know that the design is finally ready to be brought in front of wider public but this is where we need your help.\nAt this moment we are basically in homestretch with all our R&D work. Together with our team we have sorted out all engineering issues and chosen materials to be used for the new version of Leveraxe.\nThe new handle will be made of engineering compound, characterized by high mechanical strength, stiffness and thermal resistance. Most futuristic about this part is that it is hollow inside, making the Leveraxe even lighter, which in turn helps to build up more speed when in action. Furthermore, this polyamide offers high toughness at low temperatures as well as easy processing during production.\nThe new axe head will be made of iron alloy, which enables us to produce more complicated products in one step but also offer excellent wear resistance in later use. Regarding the design we will keep all the proven features like the side hook, which will clamp on the log after the swing, thus reducing the risk of hitting yourself.\nWe have totally reinvented the oldest tool known to mankind. Leveraxe is a smart wood-splitting device. It is simply clever!\nLeveraxe is based on a lever mechanism and rotational action. The head is attached from the side, not the center, which alters its center of gravity.\nAfter you hit a log, Leveraxe head will break in few millimeters and then stops. At the same time counterweight on the right side of the head forces the axe to fall sideways, splitting the log apart with ease. Because of that Leveraxe can handle all common hardwood.\nPLAY\n\nWe are currently working together with top manufacturers to produce the new version of Leveraxe. However, to produce on a larger scale we require expensive production tooling.\nPlease help us fund our project and be part of this historical adventure of reinventing the oldest tool known to mankind - lets make it happen together!\nWe have been testing prototypes with people around the world and the feedback has been more than amazing. Leveraxe really works like promised.\nThank you for considering backing our project in Kickstarter. I am sure you will find nothing else like Leveraxe \u2013 in terms of design, function and overall quality \u2013 anywhere in the world.\nTo reward you helping us kick-start this project, we offer our invention in limited colors and with very special price. Make sure to check out the green Leveraxe Kickstarter Special Edition in available pledges!\nShould you choose a Leveraxe, congratulations and welcome to the family \u2013 as you are starting a wonderful journey amongst many others! It will give you many years of enjoyment as it is built to last decades.\nKind regards,\nHeikki K\u00e4rn\u00e4\nInventor\nINTERNATIONAL BACKERS\nWe are proud to have Leveraxe fans all over the world.

I\u2019ve had them all. Almost daily. And so, for the last little while it\u2019s felt like I\u2019ve been held at gunpoint!\nLong story short:\nI decided to \"bite the bullet\" and create what you wanted.\nSo after an obscene amount of design, development, testing and tweaking...\nI can finally reveal to you the TiBiner\u2122:\nThe TiBiner\u2122 is the ultimate key-chain carabiner - designed specifically for this type of use. Ultra-light and super-simple to clip on and off.\nThe model of the TiBiner\u2122 above is the 'T60' - it's a fully-titanium, ultra-minimalist never-before-released carabiner.\nBut it gets better...\nA few months ago I created a limited run of double-ended titanium carabiners and they sold out in just a few hours - it was crazy!\nAnd, as with pretty much every product that sells-out on my website - there was a mob of frenzied customers asking, and even demanding, I make them again.\nThe truth is:\nI've further developed and refined that double-ended titanium carabiner and am now giving you access to it.\nAnd this carabiner is called the TiBiner\u2122 'T60D':\nThis is the 'T60D' model of the TiBiner\u2122 - the 'D' stands for \"Double\" because of the double-ended functionality.\nJust for the record,\nThe T60D has all the same unique, custom design features as the T60.\nSimply put:\nThe T60D has gone through the same rigorous, no-holds-barred development process as the T60 - so you know it's tried, tested and proven!\nThe 'D' in the T60D name stands for 'Double'... because of it's double-ended design.\nIt's kinda crazy... not only is the TiBiner\u2122 down-to-earth functional, but it's possibly the SEXIEST carabiner ever made!\nHave you got a \"bug out\" bag ready to grab and take with you in an emergency situation?... then a set of TiBiners\u2122 are an absolute MUST!\n  And here's what you need to know about the TiBiner\u2122 T60 and T60D:\nMade entirely from Grade 5 Titanium (so you\u2019ve got the ultimate combination of strength, lightness and absolute bragging rights!)\nOnly one moving part -- no complex hinges or pins to go wrong (because of its simple design you can have absolute confidence your TiBiner\u2122 is never going to seize, stick or fall apart!)\nProprietary \u201cQuick Release\u201d lever design (you will be un-clipping your TiBiner\u2122 with a single, easy press of the unique lever mechanism\u2026 EVERY time!)\nEasy \u201csnap on\u201d clipping action (just push the spring-lever of the TiBiner\u2122 onto whatever it is you want to clip it onto in one quick motion!)\nYou know, I don't think I could make the TiBiner\u2122 T60 any simpler for you if I tried!\nPssst, here's a little secret... the TiBiner\u2122 T60D is actually stronger than the original T60 model.\nAt just over 60mm (2 1/4\") long the TiBiner\u2122 T60 and T60D sit perfectly in the \"sweet spot\" in terms of size.\nSpecifically designed for everyday use -- so no \u201cover-engineering\u201d (this means you're getting a titanium carabiner that does exactly what it's supposed to without any unnecessary weight... or features you'll never use!)\nProprietary Matte finish (your TiBiner\u2122 is going to get the same proprietary silky-smooth, Matte finish my other high-end titanium products get!)\nSmart \u201chook\u201d to help prevent accidental un-clipping (this is the same unique function I\u2019ve used on other titanium products... so you can be damn sure it works!)\nPocket-friendly size (the TiBiner\u2122 was designed to be not-too-big and not-too-small... it\u2019s the \u201cGoldilocks\u201d of carabiners \u2013 you will almost certainly find it \u201cjust right\u201d!)\nHere's the T60 together with a bunch of my other high-end, titanium products: TiWrench\u2122, PryMal\u2122, TiTweezers\u2122, and TiClaw\u2122\nMade from rock-solid 3.5mm -- 0.140\u201d -- titanium (so you \u2018ve got the ultimate combination of super-strength and ultra-lightness all rolled into one!)\nBeveled edges (it's not just good enough for the TiBiner\u2122 to be \"functional\"... I made sure it also looks damn good too - so you can be the envy of your friends and family!)\nPrecision machined (the design and machining tolerances of the TiBiner\u2122 gets well into aerospace industry accuracy -- perfect for you to boast about at parties!)\nGuaranteed for life (as with everything I create... you\u2019re going to get my personal 100% unconditional guarantee!)\nPrecision engineered beveling on the TiBiners\u2122 pretty much guarantees you will be envied by anyone you show these to. You have been warned!\nHeres' the T60 and T60D next to a standard 'AA' battery to help you visualise the size of them.\nWorks as a super-secure pocket-clip (not only can you hang your TiBiner\u2122 off your belt-loop... but, when you clip it on the edge of your pocket, it \u201clocks on\u201d like alligator jaws!)\nMinimalist design (you\u2019ve got the ultimate no-nonsense titanium carabiner that not only looks good... but it has literally nothing to \u201cgo wrong\u201d either!)\nUltimate camping and hiking companion (a set of TiBiners\u2122 are indispensable when out in the wilderness -- from tying onto paracord to hanging your gear!)\nTo be honest... The TiBiner\u2122 T60D model in particular is the carabiner you're unlikely to be able to do without once you've taken it on your first hiking or camping trip!\nRemember... the TiBiner\u2122 is ultra-light and because it's made from Grade 5 Titanium - it will probably be something you pass down to your grandchildren!\nSilky-smooth lever-action (the spring-lever opening mechanism design has been tweaked and tested so it works 1000 times out of 1000 tests!)\nSuper-grippy \u201cfinger grip\u201d grooves (the TiBiner\u2122 has the tried-and-tested grip-pattern found on many of my other products... so it will never slip or slide when you\u2019re pressing the spring-lever to open it!)\nThe T60 was pretty much made-to-measure for the task of belt-loop hanging of your keys and everyday carry gear.\nLike I said:\nI was pretty much forced to create these high-end, titanium carabiners. My previous Customers demanded it!\nAnd truthfully...\nI really didn't want to disappoint my previous Backers and Customers because of the great emails, comments and private messages I continually receive from them.\nHere's just a small sample of what I'm talking about:\nBack to what I was saying...\nThe TiBiner\u2122 has been designed for every day use on belt-loops, rucksacks, and so on.\nIt's not designed for you to swing yourself from the nearest cliff... and so there is no \"over-engineering\".\nThe TiBiner\u2122 is super-light, ultra-minimalist and made to last several lifetimes (literally!).\nDid I mention the precision of the machining of the TiBiner\u2122 reaches near-aerospace tolerances!\nBut the bottom line is...\nThe TiBiner\u2122 was designed and created because my previous Customers wanted a high-end, one-of-a-kind-and-nothing-held-back titanium carabiner.\nAnd this was because they were blown-away by my blisteringly successful HookUp\u2122 clips I created on a previous Kickstarter project.\nYou will barely notice two or three TiBiner\u2122 T60D carabiners clipped onto your backpack... but they will be ready for action when you NEED them!\nWait, there's more...\nLet's run through some of the unique features of the TiBiner\u2122:\nCustom Beveled Edges\nI wasn't happy to settle for just a minimalist design for the TiBiner\u2122.\nSo I took things a little further and added custom beveling to the design.\nDon't blame me if your friends and family are shamefully envious of your TiBiner\u2122!\nProprietary Matte Finish\nHaving now designed and created over a dozen different, high-end titanium products... I've got the surface finish perfected!\nYour TiBiner\u2122 is going to have the same buttery-smooth and absolutely flawless Matte finish as my other sought-after titanium products.\nSuper-Secure \"Hook\"\nTo ensure your TiBiner\u2122 has absolutely no risk of slipping off whatever you have it clipped onto...\n... I've specifically designed-in a \"hook\" where the spring-lever closes.\nYou can have 100% confidence that whenever you clip your TiBiner\u2122 onto something, then it's damn well going to stay there!\nOne-Piece, Easy-To-Press \"Quick Release\" Spring-Lever\nAfter perfecting the spring-lever on previous titanium products...\n...I re-designed this same tried-tested-and-proven mechanism for the TiBiner\u2122.\nAs far as I know, this easy-to-press lever mechanism is unique to my designs. It's super-practical and makes un-clipping your TiBiner\u2122 incredibly easy.\nQuite simply:\nThe TiBiner\u2122 spring-lever mechanism is the ultimate in simplicity and reliability.\nUltra-Grippy \"Finger Grips\"\nThe finger-grip pattern on the TiBiner\u2122 is the same tried-and-tested pattern I've used on a ton of my other products.\nSo you can be damn sure your fingers are never going to slip or slide when unclipping your TiBiner\u2122.\nLast but not least...\nYou may already know this, but I always offer a lifetime guarantee with everything I create.\nAnd the TiBiner\u2122 is no different.\nYou\u2019re going to be getting my personal 100% Unconditional Money-Back Guarantee.\nIf you\u2019re not absolutely blown-away by your TiBiner\u2122 the moment you open the packaging... then just ask me for you pledge amount back. And I\u2019ll give you back every single penny no questions asked.\nNot only that, but...\nIf you somehow manage to bend or break your TiBiner\u2122 just let me know and I'll replace it for you immediately!\nOh, and one more thing...\nThe reason I can offer you this guarantee is because of the absolute confidence I (and my Customers) have in what I produce. Simple.\nIf you're going hiking or camping, then you really don't want to be setting out without at least four or five TiBiners\u2122.\nVitally important last and final point:\nI've created two ***Kickstarter Exclusive*** Reward Packages specifically for YOU.\nThese packages are way, WAY below the planned retail price... and, quite frankly, are an obscenely good offer (even if I say so myself).\nHere's why I've been forced to make this Magnus-has-gone-stark-raving-mad offer to you...\nI've just paid the deposit on a new \"fancy pants\" tumbler (so I can get an even better finish on my high-end titanium products). And now I've got to come up with the cash to pay for the rest of it!\nSimply put:\nMy back is against the wall on this one. I literally have to do whatever it takes... and making you \"an offer you can't refuse\" is pretty much my only hope at this point.\nThe best part is, you are the one that's going to benefit the most from this situation I'm now in.\nDon't get me wrong...\nI've not \"cornered\" myself here - worst case scenario is that I put the new tumbler on hold ...or I get a bank loan (which I really don't want to do - because I'd much rather give you this incredible never-to-be-repeated offer than hand over cash to some \"Fat Cat\" bankers!)\nTake a look at the Rewards below -- particularly the ***Kickstarter Exclusive*** Reward Packages -- and discover just how good these one-time offers are...\nLet\u2019s take care of this...\nNow you've seen the Rewards above - it's time to pledge for the one that works best for you. Scroll to the top of this page and click on the Reward level you want to pledge for.\nOne last thing...\nI\u2019m not sure if I\u2019ll continue to produce the TiBiner\u2122 after this Kickstarter project is finished and the Rewards are shipped out.\nBacking this project right now is the only way you can guarantee you\u2019re going to get access to the TiBiners\u2122.\nDon\u2019t delay! Scroll to the top of this page and click on the Reward you want to pledge for RIGHT NOW!\nSincerely,\nMagnus Macdonald\nP.S. Remember... even when this project gets funded and I ship out all the Rewards - I cannot guarantee I\u2019ll be producing the TiBiners\u2122 ever again. And, even if I did, they will almost certainly never be at this exclusive-to-Kickstarter low price.\nP.P.S. Don\u2019t forget... You\u2019re getting my personal, 100% unconditional money-back guarantee with your TiBiners\u2122 (which means you can return your Reward to me for any reason... or even no reason at all... and I\u2019ll give you back every penny of your pledge amount. No questions asked).\nP.P.P.S. One last thing... You\u2019re getting what are possibly the most original, minimalist, high-end and fully Grade 5 titanium carabiners ever produced. The only way you can guarantee you \u201clock in\u201d yours is to scroll to the top of this page and pledge for the Reward you want RIGHT NOW!\nFAQs\nWhy Does Your Profile Show This Is Your First Kickstarter Project (\u2026When I Know You\u2019ve Launched Four Very Successful Kickstarter Projects In The Past)?\nA couple of super-simple reasons:\n#1 \u2013 After Backing around 70 other Kickstarter projects I want to try and keep a Kickstarter account as a Project Creator separate to the account I pledge with.\n#2 \u2013 As Cogent Industries (that\u2019s my fancy-sounding business name :-D) grows, then I hope to start being able to ship from locations closer to where YOU live. This would have huge benefits in terms of speed, reliability of delivery, import tax, and so on.\n(Some of the products from my previous Kickstarter campaigns are available on my website).\nWhy Do You Offer An Unconditional Money-Back Guarantee?\nSimple: I am very, VERY confident of the quality of what I make.\nI can\u2019t see any reason why I wouldn\u2019t offer such a guarantee to you. It\u2019s difficult for you to see the quality of the TiBiners\u2122 BEFORE you physically receive them.\nSo what I CAN do for you is to remove ALL \u201crisk\u201d in backing this project. Know that you can return your TiBiners\u2122 if you're not blown-away by the quality and functionality of them.\nHow Do I Order Multiple Rewards?\nIt's EASY... just double your pledge amount for whichever Reward you've selected and you'll receive two of that Reward. (...and if you want three of a particular Reward - then just pledge three times the price of that Reward)\nWhy Don\u2019t You Have Any Stretch Goals?\nI try to provide you with the best Rewards possible before I launch a campaign - so I don't typically do stretch goals.\nI anticipate the TiBiner\u2122 project being successful and getting reasonably \"over-funded\".\nHowever, should this project really take-off and get funded well above the funding level ...I may then offer some stretch goals. That\u2019s fair, right?\nWill Your Titanium HookUp\u2122 Clips Fit On The TiBiner\u2122?\nThey will fit on, yes. BUT...\nBecause the HookUp\u2122 clips are so compact - they cannot just \"clip\" on... they can only be put on the TiBiner\u2122 by opening the spring-lever of the TiBiner\u2122 itself.\nBut the good news is that I plan to produce some larger version of the HookUp\u2122 clips soon so this will be a non-issue.\nHow Strong Are The Carabiners?\nThese carabiners are specifically designed for everyday use.\nThe carabiners have been engineered to be compact, light and minimalist... for use on belt-loops, rucksacks and so on.\nSimply put:\nThese are not \u201cheavy-duty\u201d carabiners for you to go climbing. And so I have not done any form of official breaking-strain tests.\nThey are super-strong and will handle pretty much anything you throw at them in everyday use.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI have over a dozen titanium products to my name now. All of them designed, made and shipped myself!\n\nSimply put:\n\nI have the processes and systems in place to fulfill the project on time (and, most likely, ahead of time).\n\nThe only real issue would be if I was significantly over-funded by some huge amount (unlikely).

From room to room, their house to a friends\u2019 or even home to office. \nWith Proper Audio 2, we want to create a speaker that is truly the best of both worlds.\nElegantly Mount Your Music\nPutting your speaker on a wall not only looks insanely cool, but creates a full room sound experience, elevating your speaker to ear level and making the most of your music, whether listening alone or with a room full of friends.\nIt's Easy to Install and Mount\nThe Proper Audio 2 mount disks are available in Black or White and install in 2 seconds with simple, residue free 3M adhesive.  Once installed, it's only a quick 'turn a click' to mount or remove.\nPLAY\n\nIt Moves Effortlessly\nThe slim, low profile mount disks are barely visible, meaning you can feel comfortable sticking one to a wall in every room, and then taking Proper Audio 2 with you, wherever you are at any given time.\nPLAY\n\nIt Can Be Taken Anywhere\nBeing battery powered and offering a full 8 hours of use on a single charge, it also loves being taken on the go, and is light & durable with a soft rubber base to rest comfortbaly on any surface, anywhere.\nIt Connects to All Devices\nProper Audio 2 is powered by Bluetooth which allows you to wirelessly connect and play music without cables and without limits. Almost every smart phone, tablet, laptop, etc is equipped with Bluetooth. Universally compatible and works with iOS, Android, Mac OSX, Blackberry, Windows, etc.\nPLAY\n\nEngineered for Room Filling Sound\nProper Audio 2's high performance acoustic chamber and driver cone design spread the sound evenly throughout the room for a full, 360-degree audio experience. You will enjoy an impressive 85db of rich, well balanced sound.\nFor PA2, we have also integrated a passive bass driver, which allows us to generate the great deep low end audio of a quality powered woofer, without draining any battery power.\nWe have been enjoying Proper Audio 2 mounted to our studio walls for the past 3 months, listening to our favorite Spotify playlists all day, everyday. We're so excited about how great it sounds, and, for any Melbourne backers, we invite you to visit our studio anytime to meet the team experience it yourself!\nIt's Feature Packed\nIt's the Ultimate iPhone Dock\nProper Audio 2 is also the worlds first magnetic iPhone speaker mount. With simple tap and go iPhone mounting, your speaker becomes the best place to leave your iPhone and enjoy movies, music videos, coverflow, facetime, skype or anything else with great, big sound.  It's a completely new speaker experience that truly integrates your iPhone and takes advantage of your iPhone's beautiful screen.\nFour high powered (and electronics-safe) neodymium magnets are hidden beneath the 'M Lock' mount plate at the center of PA2's droplet mesh. Mounting your iPhone is a matter of a simple tap-on/tap-off when used in conjunction with Proper\u2122 M Lock iPhone cases, available for iPhone 4 to 6 Plus.\nHere are some great apps that look beautiful and work seamlessly with the Proper Audio + iPhone Mount setup:\nIt's a Speakerphone\nIt's not only about great music. Proper Audio 2 also works seamlessly as a hands free Speakerphone. Our onboard noise-cancelling microphone means you're heard clearly on the receiving end, and our superior audio components mean your caller is heard loud and clear.  PA2's speakerphone functionality turns regular phone calls into experiences that feel like the person is right in the room with you.\nYour iPhone is already designed to move between music and phone calls seamlessly, and Proper Audio 2 makes that experience bigger and better in every way. When a call comes in, your music fades out and the call can be answered. Done talking? Your music fades back in and picks up right where it left off.\nIt's Beautifully Minimal \nMuch of our design work has centered around squeezing a lot of technology into the simplest of shapes, a circle. With this minimal approach, we are left with only the absolutely necessary details, keeping the focus on one thing - your music. Spheres are also ideal acoustic sound chambers, and the shape plays a big role in helping us deliver beautiful audio in a small, lightweight speaker.\nWe can\u2019t wait to share this great project with you. By pledging, you get us one step closer to making this product available to iPhone lovers all around the world, and you will have the satisfaction of knowing YOU helped make it happen.\nWhy we need your help\nSeveral generations of prototypes and more than 12 months of design development has already gone into Proper Audio 2. To start mass production we need to make considerable purchases, including injection moulding tools and electronic components. What you contribution will help us do:\n$4K, Kickstarter and Amazon Payment Fees\n$10K, Injection Moulding Tools\n$12K, Global Bluetooth Certifications and PCB Development\n$14K, First Production Run\nWe have seen a lot of Kickstarter projects take months and even years to hit their delivery dates, we have been designing and manufacturing products for over 4 years and have great respect for how long products \"really\" take to get to market. We have been testing working prototypes for the last few months, they perform exactly as we intend the final units to perform, so we are as ready as our project could be. \nThis is our anticipated timeline:\nWho is Studio Proper?\nWe're the 4 year old industrial design studio behind the Proper\u2122 range of iPhone & iPad cases, stands and modular mounts. We're based in Melbourne, Australia and our products currently ship to over 70 countries.\nAs a team, we believe that music is an experience that goes far beyond what you hear; it's also what you see and what you feel. It's also something we all love sharing with friends and family. How you interact with your music creates the experience that we all strive for in our everyday lives.\nHow Proper Audio 2 Came About\nThis product is the result of a previous, paused Kickstarter campaign. We're thankful to the hundreds of Kickstarter pledgers who provided us with such quality feedback the first time around, and voiced their desire for this product to be made. \nWe listened, and have spent the last year further developing PA2, focusing on performance, usability, aesthetics and most importantly first class audio quality, combining it all into a single product experience we know you are going to love.\nThe Team\nTaking everything you loved about PA1, and working hard to add the features our backers requested, we went ahead and tweaked the design. The result is Proper Audio 2 - a speaker that does everything you want it to, and much more.\nIn order to bring Proper Audio 2 to life, we need your support. Not only does this mean pledging for your very own speaker, but also sharing this project with your friends.

We consider our manufacturing experience to be one of our greatest strengths at Studio Proper. Through selling our current range of products, we have very strong existing manufacturing relationships.\n\nWe've spent the last year working hard vetting factories, coordinating assembly of the final product, and cultivating positive, personal relationships with our suppliers (this is really important in China!). We've finalised the product design focusing on manufacturability, developed working prototypes, and with Studio Proper staff on the factory floor we have structured QC for every unit that comes off the production line.\n\nWe've learned an immense amount along the way, and we've taken pre-emptive steps that we hope will mean there are no surprises along the way. We've invested a lot of focus pre-Kickstarter, to get to a point where we're confident the product is proven and manufacturable with minimal alterations.\n\nThat said, producing anything has challenges. International holidays can often slow down production time and there's always the chance for unforeseen issues, but we're confident that once we begin manufacturing with the funds this campaign raises, we've done the hard work upfront to make sure everything goes smoothly. Past that, already have a proven supply chain that can scale and distribute effectively.\n\nWe are very proud of this product, and very dedicated to bringing it to you.

When armed with dish soap and hyper-maneuverable scrub brushes, he still couldn't loosen the bacteria from the bottle.

A phone call to mom yielded some ideas; a drinking vessel designed to open up in the middle for easy cleaning that can compact to half its size when empty.\nResilient and ever thirsty, Chris grabbed his sketch pad and hacksaw.

Envisioned by engineer Ewen Smith and product designer Daniel Hood, Wolf is the first product by startup cycling technology firm, Augur. Wolf is a seamless blend of efficient lighting and an intelligent, onboard controller. Wolf keeps you and your team seen and safe - and ahead of the pack.  \nFront Lamp: See Further, Be Safer.\nCollective Safety - The Next Thing You'll Never Cycle Without\nCollective Safety underpins the need for Wolf. As a cyclist, I've seen too many avoidable crashes, bumps and scrapes caused by the dangers (and thrills) of riding in a peloton. A clear view ahead becomes a dazzling brightness as another cyclist's light cuts across your vision. Cycling with your teammates, this can be quite dangerous. This is why we have invented Wolf and Collective Safety. \nCollective Safety is an intelligent communications system built into every Wolf light. Wolf is constantly searching for members of its pack. When it finds another Wolf light, it automatically activates the safest lighting mode, calculating distance and speed. In a peloton, it means that cyclists on the outside have the brightest lights, while those in the middle are dimmed, ensuring that everyone can see - and be seen - safely. Collective Safely keeps you and your team out of harm's way. \nAnatomy of a Wolf\nWolf by Augur is made by cyclists. We have carefully considered how our design and materials can meet your needs and improve your ride. Industry leading CREE LEDs meet machined aluminium. Onboard electronics are designed to handle robustly the challenges faced by the toughest road warriors. To get you salivating, take a look at what Wolf is packing: \nMachined, 6061 anodised aluminium\nLong life rechargeable lithium polymer batteries\nIP56 rating to prevent water and dust entering the lights\nCompact, light, cordless design\nSecure silicone attachment straps\nFour Modes: Every Situation Covered\nNo two rides are ever the same. With four intelligent lighting modes, Wolf has something for everyone - at all times. Stay on a mode for at least 20 seconds, and the next time you wake up your Wolf lights, they'll remember that mode and be ready to go.\nCollective Safety at work: Outermost lights are bright, while inner rear lights are dim. All the safety, none of the blinding.\nHigh Intensity Strobe lets everyone know you're coming. Signal to other road users that you and the team are on the way. Wolf's high intensity strobe focuses attention where and when you need it. \nFull Power Beam cuts through the darkness. Pump 165 lumens in a 20 degree wide beam straight ahead. See further so you can go faster. Improve your situational awareness with a market leading brightness to runtime ratio in this well known and loved power mode. \nLow Intensity Blink a healthy mix of visibility and battery conservation. A slower strobe, the low intensity blink mode keeps you visible for longer and is suited to lower-risk riding. \nLow Intensity Beam is perfect for twilight riding, when you don't need a full beam but still need help to see where you're going. Simply set the beam and cycle. It's that easy. \nAnd because there is nothing worse that running out of battery while on the bike, there's a special fifth mode to get you home super safe:\nPower Reserve keeps your light going till you're home safely. Power Reserve mode comes on automatically if the battery is low, giving you an extra long runtime to get home safely. \nSustainable - End to End\nWe started Augur because we want to make sustainable, great products. Wolf is designed from the very beginning to deliver on our dream of great technology that doesn't hurt the earth. This is why we have chosen highly recyclable components and have achieved an amazing energy efficiency. Our stretch goals will also enable us to improve our environmental credentials - but we can only get there with your help. \nWe also don't like the idea of retiring your old Wolf just because a new model has come out. To ensure your Wolf can grow old with you we've made it USB updatable. When a new Wolf gets released you'll be able to plug your existing lights in and get all of the latest features. Its our way of giving back a little.\nThe clever Wolf rear light with Collective Safety\nTech Specs: \nWe know you love the nitty-gritty. So here it is in all its grizzly glory. You've got two options: you can read the summary below, or head over to the Wolf website to read the full rundown of Wolf's tech specs. \n165 Lumens Front / 35 Lumens Rear\nDual / Triple CREE LED with optimised optics\nCordless internal lithium polymer batteries (950mAh front, 850mAH rear).\n7 hours battery life on High Intensity Strobe mode\nUSB charging (compatible with most modern smartphone chargers too)\nIP56 Rating for Dust and Water Ingress\nWhat's in the Box: \nEvery pair of Wolf lights is carefully packaged in our branded shipping case. Made from recycled card and screen printed with the Augur logo, your Wolf lights will arrive in perfect shape and order. Inside, you'll find: \n1x Front Light with attached silicone strap\n1x Rear Light with attached silicone strap\nCharging cables (2x USB charging cables, compatible with any 5v USB port)\nQuickStart Guide\nInvitation to the Peloton Pack - Wolf's online community at Augur.net.au\nIf you order an Alphas Earlybird special, you'll also find your commemorative certificate inside.

I graduated from a Bachelor of Mechanical Engineering at Swinburne University of Technology (Australia) in 2012. After working for several years as a project engineer in one of Australia\u2019s largest engineering companies, I wanted to start a company that made sustainable, technologically advanced products for specialist markets. As an avid cyclist, Wolf was naturally my first product idea. \n\nBy backing Wolf on Kickstarter, you are joining a process with considerable momentum. Advanced prototypes have already been completed, the design is at a refinement stage and I am already looking at our shipping and packaging arrangements. Wolf is very far along the development process. Your commitment to Wolf enables payment for tooling and manufacturing, the final step before Wolf is a reality. \n\nWe want you to become a part of our community. Augur's website is home to the Peloton Pack, an online discussion space where we can work together to develop new product ideas, discuss Wolf and all enjoy our passion for cycling together. We do hope you'll enjoy your time with Wolf and if it keeps you and your team safer, we have all done our jobs - you included. \nAs seen on:\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe've done as much of the work for Wolf as we can before we look at production and shipping. Our prototypes are at very advanced stages and this means there is less risk involved than if we were starting with our idea. Most of the risks at this stage are related to delays in component deliveries, but we thought we should talk you through what we've done to minimise these risks: \n\n- Scaling Production\n\nOur prototypes have been produced in small batches of 10 units. Scaling to meet the demand of a Kickstarter with an open ended number of orders could represent a challenge in a short time frame. We have been building relationships with a number of suppliers to be able to flexibly adjust production capacity when the need arises. This means that we can bring on additional production capacity in a large production run and still be on track for our delivery estimates. \n\n- Component Production and Availability\n\nWhile we can adjust for scaling through bringing on additional suppliers, changes in component production rates and availability can impact our shipping estimates. We have a strong relationship with our component suppliers and are confident they will inform us of any large or rush orders they might receive that could delay the delivery of components necessary for Wolf. \n\n- Minor design and functionality changes. \n\nWe're including this as a risk but we see it as an opportunity. Based on feedback from the Kickstarter process we could make minor changes to the design and functionality of Wolf, such as increasing the battery life, decreasing run times, opting for slightly different materials. We will keep you informed about any such changes and we actively encourage your feedback as we move through this Kickstarter campaign.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Ewen Smith and AUGUR\nFirst created \u00b7 4 backed\nABOUT AUGUR: Augur is a design and engineering collective based in Melbourne and Perth, Australia.

A 360\u00b0 grip ring allows you to spin, flip and grip your phone like never before and then with a simple twist the grip ring is transformed into and instant phone stand in both portrait and landscape mode.\nWe are proud that we can say Linkmount will be made in the USA. With our team of Rhode Island manufacturing partners we will further the RI State\u2019s tradition of precision craftsmanship.\nThe Linkmount System is semi-permanently bonded to your phone or case. This is only possible thanks to 3M's VHB (very high bond) tape. This stuff is incredibly strong and is used in place of rivets, screws, and welds in many applications. \nWhen you get a new phone, you can take your Linkmount off with a piece of dental floss. Although the tape is not reusable, we will ship all our Linkmounts with an extra piece of VHB tape. \nPLAY\n\nWe designed our magnetic mount, the Simplemount out of frustration for cheap products that hold smartphones utilizing sticky \"gecko pads\", clunky mechanisms that were impossible to remove, and suctions cups that don't do their jobs.\nThe Simplemount is a reliable, durable, and easy to use magnetic dock. Although we initially designed them for cars, our prototype testers have found that they are quite handy: They allow you to mount your phone just about anywhere you can imagine. You can also use them to keep track of and organize most metal objects.\nUsing 3M technology Simplemount applies quickly and securely to almost any surface permanently. The Simplemount can be removed in 30 seconds without damage to the mounting surface.\nExpand your Linkmount System. The Kickstarter checkout does not offer the ability to select multiple rewards. To purchase a reward and add ons, just add the value of the add on(s) to the pledge reward you are selecting.\nFor example: If you are getting Reward #2 ($20) and \u201cSimplemounts Everywhere\u201d ($10) your total pledge will be $30 ($20+$10).\n                       For more info on the DIY Clip please see update #7\nWe are utilizing a platform called Backerkit to manage the fulfillment process. Participation is not mandatory, but greatly appreciated. Backerkit will help us deliver the Linkmount to you, on time.\nYou may choose to opt out of Backerkit, but it may slightly delay the delivery of your reward. \nYou'll be asked to confirm your pledge information (quantity, color etc) and provide your shipping address through BackerKit at the end of the campaign. It also puts you in control of your pledge by allowing you to manage your own order quantity and shipping address. \nYou will not receive a Kickstarter survey requesting this information. \n                                 We are seeking the help of the Kickstarter community to bring the Linkmount System into mass production. \nAs this is our first product, we wanted to be positive that the Linkmount works. Because of this, we made a low production run of Beta prototypes. We have had over 100 people put them on their phones and test them extensively with excellent feedback.\nWe need funding to purchase tooling for mass production, which will drive down the costs of each unit. The beta prototype and our user testing has taught us where we can improve the Linkmount and those changes are ready to go into the final mold.\nThe design and engineering of the Linkmount has now been refined and ready to go into production. This would only have been possible with the help of our manufacturing partners. \n Special thanks to AnderImage for the video.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs with any new products there is the possibility of delays.

Rick first introduced the Compressed Air Rocket launcher (CAR v1.0) to the world in MAKE magazine issue #15, where he showed how to build a compressed air rocket launcher for launching paper and tape rockets hundreds of feet.  His design utilizing a sprinkler valve and PVC construction has been duplicated countless times since the article came out.  We now have a new article about the Air Rocket Glider (ARG) and we have updated the launcher to make it even better.\nRick and Keith, presenting at the NY Maker Faire. If you have never attended a Maker Faire, they are great fun for the entire family. There were more than 100 Maker Faires held around the world last year. Click on the picture to find a faire near you.\nRick is in his twenty-first year teaching middle school social studies and language arts in San Jose, CA where he also leads after-school Maker clubs. He\u2019s the founder and director of the Washington Maker Workshop, a non-profit Maker space in a low-income neighborhood of San Jose.\nRick at NY Maker Faire, test launching a functional prototype KickSat on a paper rocket, CAR v1.0 in foreground. Thanks Zac!\nRick has also exhibited his launcher at all the Bay Area Maker Faires, the Detroit Maker Faire ,and the New York Maker Faire. At each Faire, he shows hundreds if not thousands of people how easy and fun compressed air rocketry can be. He has also earned the Editor's Choice and Educators Choice Award at nearly every event.\nJust some of the awards Rick has earned\nKeith is a mechanical design engineer with 18 years of experience designing robotic prosthetic arms (LUKE Arm), medical devices, and ultra-precision air bearings in New Hampshire. He has built several CNC machines and 3D printers, as well as founded a local CNC group. Keith is also a contributing writer for MAKE Magazine, has designed the Air Rocket Glider in MAKE #39, and helped redesign the CAR 2.0.\nKeith and his kids helping an excited young rocketeer at the NY Maker Faire\nWhen East and West Makers meet - How the ARG was developed:\nOne snowy Saturday morning in early 2012, Keith was out launching some compressed air rockets and a folding wing glider with his kids (both inspired by Rick's MAKE articles), when he realized it would be fun to combine them.  He created a 3D model that afternoon, 3D printed out some prototypes that evening, and was back outside for testing the next day.  Keith contacted Rick, supplied Rick a working prototype ARG, and they have been working together ever since.\nFirst Air Rocket Glider (ARG) Prototype on left, Ready to launch on double barrel custom machined launcher on right (not for sale)\nKeith and Rick have been refining and optimizing the design of the Air Rocket Glider (ARG) for over a year, and have plastic molding vendor already selected.\nThe New CAR v2.0:\nThe new design of the Compressed Air Rocket launcher uses all metal parts, rated to 150 PSI minimum.  There is a sturdy wooden base, that allows the unit to be folded up for easy storage and transport.  All that is required for assembly is a screwdriver and an adjustable wrench.  No need for the messy PVC adhesive, soldering, or batteries which were required for the original version 1.0.  Also, the air reservoir has been optimized, greatly reducing the volume of compressed air in each shot, without affecting performance.  This also means much less pumping!  We have already tested out our supply chain for all of the CAR v2.0 parts, and have all of the vendors on board.\nWhy we need you!\nHere is the point where we need the help of the KickStarter community; to take this from small quantity prototypes and bring it to production.  The main expense is the cost of the plastic injection mold that the ARG components will be produced in.  Also, the cost of the pneumatic components for the CAR v2.0 drops with volume, which will allow us to provide it to you at a competitive price.\nTo minimize any issues with the molded plastic parts, we have had exacting prototypes made that are true to the production part dimensions.  This allows us to check the fit and finish, and ensure great performance.\nNow, on to the fun stuff! The Rewards:\nReward 1 - The Sticker:\nThe AirRocketWorks Sticker\nFor reward #1, you will receive a sticker, and our thanks for your support.  If you like, we will add your name to our contributor list on our website, www.AirRocketWorks.com\nReward 2 - The Folding Wing Glider - FWG:\nFolding Wing Glider kit, wings open.\nPLAY\n\n The video above shows Rick's son launching a Folding Wing Glider.\nIn MAKE Magazine issue #31, Rick reintroduced the world to the nearly forgotten Folding Wing Glider (FWG).\nThis reward contains a kit of parts and detailed instructions on how to build the Folding Wing Glider, pictured above.  It is launched using a large rubber band, with the wings folded back.  During ascent, the wind resistance against the wings holds them back against the body.  When the plane slows down at its maximum altitude, the rubber band pops the wings open.  Each wing rotates forward on the wing pivot wire, then both wings rotate down on the central wing pivot.  Then the plane glides down gently.  This is based on the ingenious design of Jim Walker, who first patented the idea in 1940.\nReward #3 - The Air Rocket Glider - ARG:\nAir Rocket Glider - ARG, wings open\nPLAY\n\nThe Air Rocket Glider will be made from a tough injection molded ABS plastic, the same kid-safe material that Legos are made from.  The body tube of the ARG is a tough non-brittle nylon material that can really take a beating.  The nose of the ARG is cast from a soft super-ball type material for safety and resilience.  The wings are made from 3/32\" thick Balsa wood, which is lightweight and stiff.  If the wings become damaged, wing templates can be downloaded and printed from our website and used to cut out new wings from balsa wood sheet available from local craft stores.  NOTE: This reward level does not include the launcher.  This is being offered for the thousands of existing owners and builders of a first generation compressed air launcher.  It includes the smaller diameter launch tube required to launch the ARG.  See reward level 5 & 6 below, which include the launcher and the ARG kit.

It's easier to build, will fold up to save space, requires less pumping, but has the same great level of performance as the old design.  It's a complete kit of all the parts required to build a heavy duty launcher made from industrial grade components that will last for years.  The only tools required to build it are a Philips screw driver and an adjustable wrench.  Detailed instructions are included, and are also available on our website.  Also included is a paper template and instructions for making and customizing paper rockets.  Simply photocopy the template, cut out the pattern, build the rocket on the supplied build tube using masking tape, and you are ready for action!  Build time for these rockets is less than 10 minutes, and even kids as young as 5 can build them with a little assistance.  Customize your creation with markers, patterned duct tape, etc.   Use your imagination!  Also, this launcher can be used to launch foam rockets as well, info on our website.  These are great for kids parties, scouting events, teaching about physics, etc.  NOTE: This reward level DOES NOT INCLUDE the Air Rocket Glider kit of parts.  If you choose to purchase a ARG kit in the future, the required launch tube is supplied in this kit.  See reward level 5 and 6 below for launchers that include the ARG kit.\nReward #5 - The New CAR v2.0 and one ARG kit:\nCAR v2.0, shown with ARG ready to be launched! (pump not included)\n This reward level includes the launcher from reward level #4, and the same ARG kit from reward level #3.  To switch from launching paper rockets to launching the ARG, simply swap the launch tube on the outlet of the silver valve.  Both launch tubes are included.  If you would like to purchase additional ARG kits, please contact us directly.\nReward #6 - The New CAR v2.0 AND one ARG kit AND one FWG kit:\nRULE THE SKIES! This reward level includes the CAR v2.0 launcher from reward level #4, one ARG kit from reward level #3 AND one FWG kit from reward level #2.

There is very little risk on this proven product.\n\nARG Risks, Reward #3:\nWhile this is a brand new design, we have tested out several rounds of prototypes to ensure reliable operation of the parts. We have sent the designs out to several trusted injection molding vendors for quotes, and have arranged to work with one of them with a proven history on a previous project. The main risk for this reward level is a delayed shipping date, as the following tasks are serial: Order and machine the mold (4-6 weeks), Verify the quality of the first molded parts (1-2 weeks), procure the first batch of parts (3-4 weeks).\n\nCAR v2.0 Risks, Reward #4, 5 & 6:\nWhile this is a major improvement over the original version 1.0 CAR, we have also simplified and refined the launcher design and packaging. We already have our second prototype order in process with our pneumatic component vendor, and have tested the function and quality of every component. We have also have secured a trusted vendor we have used on previous projects to manufacture the wooden stands for the launcher.

Please!\"\nInterior Design 2014: \"It\u2019s simple, stylish, smart yet sophisticated. Perfect addition for your modern home\"\nStudio Dope: \"Studio Proper made it easy to love their newest design\"\nSound now has a place - All bluetooth speakers require a surface upon which to lay the product, in wall mounting the PA1 not only are you reducing desk or table clutter, but the you open yourself into a more elegant relationship to your listening environment.\nA speaker has one simple task; to produce beautiful satisfying sound, yet so many fall short. The typical gripe with battery powered Bluetooth speakers is that they are weak, prone to audio distortion and lack full dynamic range. \nLooking for a great Christmas gift for a loved one? Pledge for a PA1 and give out an Christmas card to tell that special someone what a great product they will be receiving in April 2014.\nYou can download the instruction and print your own PA1 Christmas card from this link here. The card will contain a web link which they can visit and read up on their new speaker system (webpage will be launched before Christmas)!\nThe PA1 is a beautiful Aluminum Bluetooth speaker, designed for what we believe to be most important: usability, great sound output and quality materials.\nThe driving force of the design was to provide everyday users with a true value design, which encompassed amazing sound without unnecessary elements, available for a fraction of regular wall speaker pricing. We\u2019ve taken everything we\u2019ve learned from our customer base and experience of making IOS accessories and fused it into the PA1. The visual styling and user interaction reflect the PA1\u2019s intuitive intention \u2013 it\u2019s a speaker that brings a new feel into the everyday home.\nGreat design & sound ought to be universal; we wanted to push beyond the norm of comparative products and were dedicated to designing everyday speakers that were just as beautiful and powerful in sound.\nWe decided to keep PA1 wired to avoid sacrificing power or sound quality, as is necessary with portable battery-powered speakers. This wiring allows us to power larger drivers, providing you with a fuller, well balanced and incredibly rich audio experience.\nNot only can PA1 be installed in under a minute, its design is flexible, PA1 can be easily moved with a simple 'turn and click' motion to any room/space that you have a Wall Mount installed. Now you have the flexibility to move your music as you move around the house, whilst allowing it to work flawlessly as a permanently installed speaker. By leveraging our universal Wallee\u2122 'X-Lock', Mount Disks and stands, we're able to offer the best of both worlds.\n On, Off, and Pairing are all intuitive and within reach - no need to compete with multiple buttons or switches.\nPA1 connects wirelessly to any Bluetooth enabled device. We've selected a premium Bluetooth module ensuring clear, consistent pairing and high quality audio streaming. PA1 also remembers up to 5 devices and automatically pairs when in range, so you'll only ever need to physically pair the first time you turn it on.\nWe're really proud to announce that based on early feedback we've worked with our internal and external engineers to add Dual Bluetooth Stereo Pairing (also known as True Wireless Stereo). This means that two PA1's will now pair together creating a true left and right channel stereo experience allowing two PA1's to be placed up to 10 meters apart. Now speakers can be placed at each side of a room for a huge sound experience!\n3 years ago we developed our 'X-Lock' modular mounting system, dubbed \"Wallee\u2122\", to enable mounting your iPad and iPhone across a range of mounts and stands. PA1 is designed around the same system, and looks great when used in conjuction with other components from our best selling range of Wall and Table Stands.\nMount your iPad alongside PA1 and you've got a complete, powerful entertainment hub. The modern day jukebox perfect for entertaining. iOS devices make for beautiful, capable media centres. PA1 is designed to work in harmony alongside your iPad or iPhone.\nInterchangeable fabric covers allow you to personalise the aesthetic to best match your environment. Covers will initially be offered in Black and White. Backers will also be able to choose between either Black or White braided power cables.\nMachined Aluminum Unibody construction for unrivaled rigidity, with a fine bead blast, anodized finish.  \nOur driver arrangement provides full stereo sound through 3 drivers. 1 tweeter for clear highs, and two large stereo drivers for deep, warm mids and lows.\nWe're the 3 year old industrial design studio behind the Wallee\u2122 range of iPhone & iPad cases, stands and modular mounts. Based in Melbourne, Australia\nAs a company, we are obsessed with customer service and work hard to deliver product happiness no matter what. We are prepared to do whatever it takes to keep our backers and customers happy.\nWe back our product so strongly that we openly invite anyone to visit our studio in Melbourne, Australia to meet the team and put these speakers through their paces in person.\nHave further questions? Or just want to learn more about PA1 from the designers behind the product? We've set up an exclusive Skype account that you can reach us on anytime we're in the studio. Call us on Skype username 'studio.proper.kshotline'.\nWe appreciate you taking part and supporting this exciting product, and we're proud to offer deep discounts on PA1 to our backers for the duration of this campaign.  PA1 will retail at $250.00 once our campaign is completed.\nWe\u2019ve spent the last 10 months developing this wonderful product focusing on everything from sound quality, use case scenarios, modularity, Bluetooth connectivity and aesthetics.  After 6 exhaustive rounds of prototyping, and months of rigorous testing, we believe we are ready for production. Here is our anticipated schedule..\nWe have partnered with Shipwire to handle warehousing, logistics and the final leg of distribution and shipping. They have successfully shipped our products to customers world-wide for the last 2 years, and have plenty of experience handling Kickstarter product delivery.\nWe're obsessed with designing for people, and feel there's no better way to do that then to allow the kickstarter community and existing customers to participate in making this exciting project come to life.\nPress Kit Download Link: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ahf28k3fhnu7c5u/bPBynQ0FPm", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our second Kickstarter campaign, and we know all too well that every \npre-production product has inherent risks and challenges, some of them unforeseen. \n\nWe've been developing and manufacturing consumer products for close to 3 years and have a deep understand of the entire process. We consider our manufacturing experience to be one of our greatest strengths at Studio Proper. Through selling our current range of products, we have very strong existing manufacturing relationships.\n\nWe've spent the last year working hard vetting factories, coordinating assembly of the final product, and cultivating positive, personal relationships with our suppliers (this is really important in China!). We've finalised the product design focusing on manufacturability, developed working prototypes, and we have structured QC for every unit that comes off the production line. We've also completed detailed site inspections for the manufacturers that we've selected.\n\nWe've learned an immense amount along the way, and we've taken pre-emptive steps that we hope will mean there are no surprises along the way. We've invested a lot of focus pre-Kickstarter, to get to a point where we're confident the product is proven and manufacturable with minimal alterations.\n\nThat said, producing anything has challenges. International holidays can often slow down production time and there's always the chance for unforeseen issues, but we're confident that once we begin manufacturing with the funds this campaign raises, we've done the hard work upfront to make sure everything goes smoothly. Past that, we've created a supply chain that can scale and distribute effectively.\n\nOur 4 strict promises to our backers are:\n\n1. BE TRANSPARENT AT ALL TIMES\n\n2. COMMUNICATE REGULARLY AND IN DETAIL\n\n3. INCLUDE BACKERS IN THE PROCESS\n\n4. INCLUDE BACKERS IN ANY DECISIONS THAT NEED TO BE MADE\n\nWe are very proud of this product, and very dedicated to bringing it to you.

Please spread the word lets get this project started! \nWhy Colladjust?\nYou have tried to iron it, starch it or press it and now your settling for the tie... Don't! \nColladjust is a simple, lightweight and innovative little addition to your collar. Simply place it under your collar where you would usually place a tie and it will support your collar nicely. Once in place you can move your collar by bending and twisting it to the height or width you like!  \nLightwright, Low Profile\nProduction Model, 3rd Gen\nColour possibilities\nI have just received these first two samples from my supplier. They included a milky white alternative silicone which in many ways I prefer. If you guys can vote on it that would be great. Alternatively we will think about giving pledgers the option at the end of the project. \n\n(the clear silicone tubing is wider in this prototype. In reality it will be 3mm in diameter like the milky white tubing in the image. A perfect snug fit. \ntwo variations\nAdjustable Size\nColladjust is unisex and can be used with any fabric type. The thin silicone tips can be simply trimmed with a pair of scissors to meet your required neck size.\nCutting colladjust to size with pliers or scissors\nfreshly cut production sample.\nBefore and After\nvarious shirt types with colladjust\nPrototypes\nThe prototype looks simple because it is, it has no frills, it just works. I have developed the product into a more appealing and functional design choosing specific materials that do their job perfectly. \nSupport Bracket - This is to keep the back of the product straight at all times and stop it from kinking when you adjust it.\nInner Spine - The thickness of the inner spine is just right to make it easy to adjust but also keep the its shape permanently. It is made from aluminium which helps to keep the product light and comfortable.\nSilicone Coating - the rough silicone coating grips to the inside of your collar to stop it moving throughout the day. It is clear to make it invisible under thin clothing. \nFinal Product\nIf you pledge for me and order a Colladust you really have something to look forward to. The final production model will be of the highest quality made from silver coloured aluminium spine and crystal clear silicone!\n\nAll products will be sent in cardboard lined jiffy bags so your colladjust will arrive in pristine condition. \nTagging Stickers ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs of now I cannot see any reason why Colladjust could not be in your collar by January.

The second batch with retail packaging will be produced in Germany. Meetings with high street retailers will begin in January. \n\nStep by step...\n\n1. Concept refinement (done September)\n2. Material selection (done September)\n3. Functional prototype (done October) \n4. Production management ( November end)\n5. Delivery and Quality control ( Late January)\n6.
