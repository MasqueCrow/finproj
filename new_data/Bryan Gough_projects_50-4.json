Today, this new home offers opportunity and peril. Remnants of ancient civilizations hold dangerous knowledge and forbidden power. Your people build settlements on new worlds, but those places rarely offer a safe haven. Conflicts often rage between people and factions. Pirates prowl the spaceways in search of easy prey. Baneful creatures and dark forces dwell on corrupted planets and in the abyssal void between stars.\nEncounter creatures both wonderous and horrifying (Art by Joshua Meehan).\nThe default tone for Starforged is human-centric science fiction on a perilous frontier. This is a scavenged future, with starships cobbled together from salvage. People cling to survival on inhospitable worlds and in remote space stations. Much has been forgotten or lost.\nVisit Remote Settlements on perilous worlds (Art by Joshua Meehan).\nIt's a dangerous life for anyone living in the Forge, and doubly so for the Ironsworn\u2014those adventurers bound to sworn quests.\nSwear iron vows and see them fulfilled or forsaken (Art by Joshua Meehan).\nInspiration comes from the the quest-driven adventures of The Mandalorian, the lived-in aesthetic and outer-rim locations of the original Star Wars trilogy, the workaday exploits of Firefly, the isolated suspense and industrial grittiness of Alien, the desperation and retro-tech of the modern reboot of Battlestar Galactica, the mysticism of Dune, and the cosmic mysteries and class struggles of The Expanse. It's all blended together into a heady stew of perilous sci-fi adventure, and topped with a dollop of Guardians of the Galaxy gonzo.\nMost aspects of the setting can be adjusted to your preferences. The campaign launch exercises offer inspiring prompts and guidance to immerse you in a galaxy of your own creation. \nThe Art\nStarforged is packed with amazing illustrations by lead artist Joshua Meehan. Josh composites photos, textures, 3d objects, and hand-painted elements to create a vibrant, cinematic rendering of the people, places, and perils of the Forge.\nSet off on perilous expeditions (Art by Joshua Meehan).\nJosh uses the Starforged oracle tables and generators to help build the unique subjects and aspects of each illustration. The art is directly inspired by the game!\nDevelopment process for an Ironsworn: Starforged illustration - from initial concept to finished piece (Art by Joshua Meehan).\nExplore mysterious precursor sites (Art by Joshua Meehan)\nIt's a perilous galaxy, so consider bringing an ally (Art by Joshua Meehan).\nFace deadly foes in high-action battles (Art by Joshua Meehan)\nThe System\nStarforged is true to Ironsworn's roots, tuned to fit the spaceborne setting, while incorporating experience and feedback from years of development and play. \nIf you're new to Ironsworn, here's a summary of how it works.\nThree Ways to Play\nLike it's predecessor,  Ironsworn: Starforged offers three ways to play.\n Guided: One or more players take the role of their characters, while a guide moderates the session.\n Co-Op You and one or more friends play together to overcome challenges and complete quests. A guide is not required.\n Solo: You portray a lone character driven to fulfill vows in a dangerous galaxy. Good luck!\nYour Character\nThe Starforged playscape, with print-and-play asset cards and character sheet.\nYour character in Starforged is composed of stats and trackers. These elements help you determine the outcome when you perform risky actions.\nAs you complete quests, make discoveries, and form bonds, you gain experience. You spend this experience to add assets\u2014vehicles, modules, paths, companions, and deeds\u2014which deepen your abilities and options.\nCharacter creation is fast and flexible, with a guided exercise to help define your background, resources, expertise, and goals.\nMoves\nMoves are self-contained systems to resolve an action, scene, or question. There are moves to cover most uncertain or risky situations you encounter in Starforged. \nFor solo and co-op play,  moves help resolve your actions and trigger new opportunities and complications. For guided play, moves take an active role in the conversation between the guide and the other players.\nSample move from Starforged.\nIronsworn: Starforged moves are inspired by the innovative, fiction-first mechanics of the Apocalypse World system created by D. Vincent Baker and Meguey Baker.\nMomentum\nThe momentum meter is one of your character's most important mechanical attributes.\nMomentum is a special mechanic which is core to playing Starforged.  You can gain momentum as an outcome or option when making moves. This represents securing advantages, acquiring new insight, and making progress in your quests. You lose momentum when you suffer a cost which causes a delay or puts you at a disadvantage.\nYou can use momentum to gain a decisive result \u2014 or avoid dire failure \u2014 on a critical move.\nAction Roll\nWhen you make a move representing a risky or uncertain action, roll three dice at once:  An action die (D6) and two challenge dice (D10). Add your relevant stat and any bonuses to your action die. This is your action score.  Then, compare your action score to each of the challenge dice and check for a strong hit, weak hit, or miss. The move will tell you how to interpret the result.\nThere are three possible outcomes for the action roll:\n Strong Hit: Your action score beats (is greater than) both the challenge dice. You succeed at what you are trying to do.\n Weak Hit: Your action score beats only one of the challenge dice. You succeed, but with a cost or lesser effect.\n Miss: Your action score doesn't beat either challenge die. You fail, or must make serious concessions\nThe Oracles\nStarforged Oracles are random prompts and generators which help answer questions in solo or co-op games, or provide creative backup for the guide in guided play. They are an inspiration engine--ready to introduce amazing locations, surprising revelations, and dire challenges to your Starforged campaign.\nMockup of oracle tables within the Starforged rulebook.\nIf you loved the oracles in Ironsworn, you'll find much more to love here. It's an entire galaxy of possibilities! Plus, these tables are largely system agnostic and can be paired with other sci-fi systems. \nStarforged oracles are included in the Preview Edition, which is an immediate reward for backing this campaign.\nShipping Info\nThe pledge levels do not include shipping. After the Kickstarter concludes, you will pay shipping for any physical rewards through the pledge manager. \nHere is a list of shipping estimates by region. \nContiguous USA: $11-$16\nEU/UK: $20-$25\nNorway/Switzerland: $33-$41\nCanada: $20-$25\nAustralia: $21-$25\nNew Zealand: $21-$34\nChina, Macao, Hong Kong: $12-$17\nRest of Asia: $24-$36\nAll Other Countries: $57-$120\nWe are customs-friendly in the UK/EU and many other regions! Check the FAQ for details.\nPledge levels and the shipping fees above do not include VAT. If VAT fees apply in your region, you will be charged those fees in the pledge manager after the campaign ends. However, we want to alleviate these charges as much as we can,  so we will cover 50% of your VAT fees!\nLegacy Add-Ons\nIn collaboration with DriveThruRG, we are offering Ironsworn books and cards as add-on rewards during this campaign. These materials are not completely compatible with Starforged, but include mechanics, tips, and guidelines which might help enrich your Starforged campaigns. Plus, they allow you to experience vow-driven quests in the perilous fantasy setting of the Ironlands. These are the existing editions of these books and cards, and are not new versions or reprints.\nThe bad news: Shipping on these legacy items is managed separately through DriveThruRPG, and shipping cannot be combined with physical Starforged rewards. \nThe good news: You'll receive your reward codes after this Kickstarter campaign ends. You can order your legacy books and cards at that time, rather than waiting for release of Starforged. \nAs a thank you for supporting Starforged, printed legacy add-ons are discounted from current prices by about 15-20%. You can select these add-ons when choosing your backer level. If you add a legacy item to your pledge, you'll receive a code to purchase that item from DriveThruRPG for the cost of production and shipping.   Check this page at DriveThruRPG for current estimated shipping costs.\n Ironsworn Print Edition - Set off on perilous quests with this 270-page core rulebook. Winner of a Gold ENNIE award! \n Ironsworn Asset Deck (Printed Deck) - Upgrade your Ironsworn playscape with a deck of printed asset cards.  \n Ironsworn: Delve - With a vast array of new options and tools, Ironsworn: Delve is the perfect companion for your Ironsworn campaign.

Playtesting has been underway for several months. Much of the art for the book has already been completed. \n\nAbsolute Tabletop has developed dozens of RPG products, and managed four successful Kickstarter projects. They have experience with fulfillment and logistics, and will help ensure a smooth delivery for our valued backers.\n\nBecause this project involves a larger team than previous Ironsworn products, we may encounter delays due to a specific individual's availability. We will put measures in place to ensure that no one (including Shawn) is an indispensable resource that would cause a failure to deliver. We will keep the backers informed about what is happening with the project, and will provide regular preview releases of the book as it is developed. \n\nWe may also encounter delays due to unexpected issues with production and shipping. Working with our fulfillment partners, we will make our best effort to identify and resolve any issues before they impact the backers. \n\nShawn has always believed in open and transparent communication with Ironsworn fans, and this project will be no exception.

Whoever has the Agent itself scores even more points, but only if they successfully lead others off their trail!\nAs the end of round approaches, the stakes get higher and higher\u2014every action taken affects who ends up with the Agent card, as well as who might know its location! Deceive your friends with mind games, reverse psychology, and other strategic plays to maximize your points.\nThat\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg\u2014keep an eye out for stray point cards, the valuable Asset card, the elusive Double Agent, and much more\u2026\nIf you enjoy strategy card games or spy-themed stuff as much as we do, join the #Agency and help us make this game a reality! Your mission is a go.\nWith all the love in the known universe,\nJohn \ud83d\udc27 , Ethan \ud83d\uddff, Alex \ud83c\udf2e\n\nWhen the campaign ends, we will be ordering the decks in bulk from PrintNinja, a top-reviewed custom printing manufacturer we've partnered with.

Our current estimate for when you'll get the game in your hands is October 2021!\nThe above is a prototype from The Game Crafter. The final decks will be ordered from PrintNinja using higher quality materials with all the same card counts!\n The Origin Story \nOn day 5 of a 16-day cross-country road trip, deep into the barren yet beautiful highways of Idaho, arguably hallucinating in the heat of the van, John turned to Alex and asked, \u201cYo, wanna make a card game?\u201d\n\u201cIght.\u201d\nThe original idea was to have a ~special card~ and aim to end the round with it in your hand. The card was nicknamed \u201cthe card\u201d, and so the game \u201cthe card the game\u201d.\nSoon enough, basic action cards like Search, Investigate, and Wiretap were added (various name changes omitted), among others.\nFinally, the yin to the yang of \u201cthe card\u201d was added: the endgame voting chart. \u201cIt would be super interesting if you only want to end with \u2018the card\u2019 if some players don\u2019t know you have it\u2014it\u2019d be a constant mind game battle whether to keep it or give it away, and how many players know where it is or not!\u201d\nEventually we added a spy theme to spice things up. \u201cThe card\u201d became the Agent, and the game became \u201cIntel\u201d. Of course\u2026 it\u2019ll always be \u201cthe card the game\u201d in our hearts. \ud83e\udde1 ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nProduction of the game is simple: a tuck box poker deck is a relatively straightforward product to make.

Protect basecamp and craft awesome new equipment with the loot collected from your fallen foes, so you can take on bigger and badder beasts!\nBattle massive monsters in a wild open world.\nWith two complete core sets, playable standalone or together, you can embark on quests in two distinct habitats teeming with native beasts. \nAs you gain more experience, the monsters get tougher. Every beast has three difficulty levels to challenge your skills. Successfully slay a 4-star monster, and you\u2019ll win your campaign!\nWant a one-shot monster fight without the tracking? \nArena quests let you hunt any monster, at any difficulty level, using any hunters, right away. Simply equip your hunters with the recommended loadout and dive headfirst into the fight!\nExplore the lush Ancient Forest...\n\n...the arid Wildspire Waste...\n...or combine sets to expand your world!\nPlay with any combination of hunters and hunt any combination of monsters during your campaign. Because hunters can make equipment from other sets, combining sets opens up a whole new world of weapons and armour for your hunters to craft.\nFind out how the core sets combine\n\n\nBecause hunters are defined by their weapons, every hunter is a different way to play. Where the great sword hunter trades movement for raw strength, commanding respect with its incredible stopping power, the dual blades hunter favours swift strikes and mobility \u2014 dashing in with a flurry of blows before dodging to safety.\nSome video game weapons come with extra special features, like the charge blade and insect glaive. To really squeeze the juice from that Divineapple in the board game, those hunters come with special rules.\nThe monsters you hunt will determine which loot you earn and what weapons you can craft to help on your next quest. So, you\u2019ll need to decide together where to follow the Scoutflies next. \nOnce you\u2019ve chosen a monster, track them through the lush Ancient Forest or arid Wildspire Waste using the choose-your-own-adventure quest book.\nImmerse yourself in the New World, gathering resources, avoiding health-sapping pitfalls, and searching for a monster that could appear at any moment.\nJust like in the video game, the tabletop monsters can be wild and unpredictable, with changing moods and attack preferences. The tracks you discover will determine what state you find the monster in, and which special attack is added to their deck.\nEnjoy the beauty of the landscape as you climb trees, scale cliffs, and explore caves for bonus resources \u2014 but don\u2019t get too distracted. Every quest has a time limit. As you hunt, you\u2019ll discard time cards, giving you less time to take down the beast when you eventually track it down...\nDiscover more about the Gathering Phase\nIt\u2019s crush-or-be-crushed with monsters as mobile as these! Every monster is a boss, and every boss is a unique challenge, with different ways of moving, different attack styles, and special rules that will trigger during battle to change things up.\nMonsters dictate the flow of battle, deciding who to target and even taking the first turn.\nLuckily, the more experience you gain, the better you\u2019ll get at predicting the monster\u2019s next move. As you learn their \u2018tells\u2019, the clues on the back of every behaviour card will give you a bigger hint at what\u2019s coming next.\nOnce the monster has made their move, it\u2019s your chance to react! Because these are wild beasts you\u2019re fighting, you won\u2019t always have the same opportunity to act before the monster moves again. \nYou\u2019ll need to decide who\u2019s best placed to attack, who needs to sharpen their weapon, and who needs to get the heck out of the way before the beast strikes again...\nDiscover more on Monster Behaviour\nYour position matters. Monsters have four arcs for their behaviours and their body parts: front, left, right, and rear. Where you\u2019re standing determines whether you\u2019ll get hit, but also what parts you can target.\nBreaking parts can trigger rules that change monster behaviour and earn bonus loot for your whole party, which you can use to craft upgraded weapons for taking on tougher beasts.\nWhen you\u2019re taking on a monster, three things are vital to success: positioning, teamwork, and managing your cards.\nThere are no dice in combat. Instead, combat is controlled by cards which you\u2019ll use to create combos, meaning you\u2019ll string together attacks at the cost of stamina.\nBecause attack cards can also be used for movement and dodging attacks, which also uses stamina slots, you\u2019ll need to make strategic choices about when to play cards and when to keep your board clear.\nKeep an eye on your stamina to balance your offensive and defensive moves, or you might find yourself caught out and crushed by a massive monster attack!\nDiscover more on How Hunters Work\n Craft new weapons and armour upgrades using the hard-won loot from your monster battles, swapping cards into your deck to gain newer (and more powerful!) bonuses and attacks.\nChecking potential rewards is key to choosing your next monster quest. Some equipment offers elemental damage and resistance which could help you in a future hunt.\nBecause everything you craft stays in your inventory, switch equipment between quests to give you the best chance against the next beast!\nYou\u2019ll start with a unique attack deck based on your hunter\u2019s weapon and upgrade options you can craft from bone and ore. The more monster loot you claim, the better your weapon choices become!\nDiscover more on Upgrading Your Hunter\nLike the video game, Monster Hunter World: The Board Game is a campaign game. Over multiple sessions, you\u2019ll face tougher monsters, upgrading your hunter and equipment as you go.\nThe more monsters you slay, the better the weapons you can craft, the bigger the monsters you can hunt \u2014 until you\u2019re ready to take on a 4-star monster and win your campaign!\nWith 25 campaign days to spend (more if you're playing with combined sets), you'll need to make strategic choices about which monster to hunt and when. \nWill you hunt tougher versions of the same monster to craft all the weapons you can? Or try a fresh challenge?\nAfter a heart-pounding hunt, you may want to kick back and relax. Spend a few campaign days at HQ visiting the Smithy to craft new equipment, petting the Poogie, and enjoying a meal whipped up by the Meowscular Chef!\nHow Hunters Work\nTracking Monsters\nMonster Behaviour\nUpgrading Your Hunter\nArena Quests \n Combining the Core Sets\n   We\u2019ll ship your rewards to one of our international hubs.

Instead, crossing continental distances, only to reach the wall of a \u2018room\u2019. Passing beyond will only bring yet another room on the other side of it, with new lands stretching off just as far again.\nAlthough all manner of threats exist out in the wilds, such as strange animals and beasts, and other barbaric or dangerous people, the greatest dangers of all, are the Rooks. Huge, hulking stone automatons that patrol, somewhat mindlessly, out in the wilds of the Colostle\u2019s rooms.\nThat is until they are disturbed. Every Rook is different, there are no two the same, and they are the only source of magic in the world. As such, they are something of a target to hunters looking for tech they can scavenge, artefacts they can sell or magic crystals to grant them strange and unpredictable powers.\nThat is if they can bring one down...\nA 'room' stretching out before an Armed adventurer...\nWhat is a solo RPG?\nThink of it like a personal, mindful writing exercise, where the game provides you with prompts to write your own fascinating adventure in this strange world. You will be keeping a journal of your adventures, and the game system is a way to determine what you will encounter along the way, and to dictate the outcome of combat. All the book provides is prompts and inspirations, but it is up to you and your character to flesh out the details and to write about what you discover.\nFirst you need to create a character, someone of this world. This book will guide you through this process, but it is completely up to you. Then the game provides you with an outline of your first adventure. You can decide how to interpret these prompts and what to write, there are no limits to what you can do, this is YOUR adventure.\n\nWhat is in the book?\nThe Colostle book will be a 24 page A5 tome with all the rules required to create and play your own Colostle adventure. The book will have a thick 300gsm cover with foiled lettering, and the internal pages will be on off-white recycled paper for an otherworldly look and feel. The book will also feature black and white illustrations throughout suggesting glimpses of the world and the kind of characters you could create.\nDesign of the interior black and white pages (mockup)\nHow does the game work?\nThe basic principle is that of drawing cards from a shuffled deck of playing cards, and checking their colour, suit or number against tables to see what they represent for your adventure.\nIn the exploration phase of the game cards might stand for meeting another traveller on your journey, finding some abandoned ruins or discovering a mysterious doorway. its up to you to write in your journal what these things are and what they mean for your character. The game simply suggests things, like writing prompts, set against a fantastical world... its up to you what they all mean for your greater story. In the Combat phase, cards stand for attacks with the numbers on the cards showing their strength. Playing the right card at the right time could mean victory for your character!\nAs you play and write you will find ideas for what the mysteries of the Colostle might mean, just falling into your head. I don't provide the answers in the book, every player will discover their own truth and meaning of the world.\nAll you will need is a deck of playing cards, a pen, some rough paper for making gameplay notes and a journal to record your character's adventures in.\nHow to Play Colostle - Example of a typical Exploration and Combat phase in the game\n3 Unique Character classes\nTo play Colostle you will need to create a character, and to that end there are 3 unique classes introduced in the book that will help you do that. They are; The Armed, The Followed and The Helmed. All of them use parts and pieces harvested from Rooks that give them special abilities. I don't want to give everything away, as it is only a small book (!) but you can see an Illustration of The Armed class below.\nThe Armed - wielders of harvested Rook arms\n Rewards + Stretch Goals Breakdown\n Cheaper Shipping Options\nIf you look in the rewards you will notice that some rewards have an identical twin with the added 'Cheaper Shipping' to their title. This is because I found a cheaper shipping cost later in the life of the campaign after these tiers had been already added. If you are a new backer, and you live outside the UK, please make sure you select the 'Cheaper Shipping' version of the tier you would like, to make sure you get the best deal on your shipping.\n(These 'Cheaper Shipping' options only exist for the top 3 tiers, \u00a320 or over. The lower tiers have accurate international shipping as they are, so you don't need to worry about those)\nNew artwork for the 'Oceans' module!\nNew artwork for the 'Battlements' module\nWho am I?\nMy name is Nich Angell and I am a comic book artist, illustrator, writer and game designer. I am one quarter of the stories-and-games company Big Punch Studios, creators of comics such as 7STRING, Afterlife Inc., and Cat and Meringue and the super fun card game Sandwich Masters!\nI have worked on a lot of comics and games, both from an illustrator perspective and a concept/creation one. More than anything I love creating worlds, whether thats a place to hear a story from, or a place to play a game in, making worlds is my thing! So when I found out about solo RPGs and played a few I realised what an awesome thing they were, a small tight rulebook for a brand new world.\nAs someone with a wild imagination I am always coming up with new ideas and Colostle is the latest setting that popped into my head. This time though, I was excited to create a more open ended world so that others can experience the joy I have creating stories, adventures and mysteries.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI have worked on many graphic novels and as such am extremely familiar with creating books and making artwork printready. I have run a great many Kickstarters both on my own and as part of Big Punch so I am highly confident in the process and know the extent of what is involved.\n\nAs with all of my Kickstarters and those I have been a part of, I believe communication is key. I know to update regularly and keep the backers informed even if unforeseen delays or problems occur.\n\nWith a small book and a small print run like this I don't foresee any issues.

Serenity. The Millennium Falcon. \nYou can\u2019t have a good space story without an iconic spaceship. Of course, more often than not, the heroes of the story aren\u2019t flying some shiny new cruiser. Those are for the wealthy, the elites\u2014not our lovable scoundrels. No, they fly the bucket of bolts\u2014the outworn, patched-up junker held together with hope, prayers and duct tape.\nThe eponymous 'bucket of bolts'\nThese ships weren\u2019t always hunks of junk though\u2014they have long and storied histories, and might even have been respectable vessels at some point. We only ever see a slice of that story though, a single captain and their motley crew. \nThis game flips the perspective.  \n\nThe Game.\nBucket of Bolts is a hack of Artefact, my game from last year's ZineQuest. Instead of creating a magical item, this time you'll be telling the story of a single spaceship. You\u2019ll create a brand new freighter, fresh off the manufacturing line, and explore its history through each of the people who captain it. Your ship will change as the decades pass - new names, new parts, fresh paint, fresh starts - until your story draws to a close.\nYou\u2019ll choose your Captains, bringing them to life with names and details, and create stories of their time with your ship using prompts and tables. When you\u2018re ready to move on, you\u2019ll choose a Fate for your ship. Maybe it\u2019s traded away fairly, but more likely it\u2019s stolen, captured or even wrecked. You might drift for a while as you wait for your next Captain, or the seat might still be warm when a new one takes over. Either way, the galaxy will change around you, and you\u2019ll see it all from the view in the cockpit.\nLike the original Artefact, it\u2019s a great way to spend an hour or two; sketching, world-building and storytelling in your own company. It's also a fantastic way to generate really unique ships for tabletop games like Edge of the Empire, Traveller or Scum & Villainy, with rich backstories, fun details and tonnes of personality.\n\nThe Zine.\nFormat \nA little paper prototype of the zine opening.\nI'll be using a new format for the physical rewards. Beak zines take an A3 sheet of paper and fold it into an 8-page A6 booklet. This process leaves one side of the paper blank, that people sometimes use to make a poster.\nOne of the things that's always bugged me about Artefact is how much flicking around the book you need to do as you play the game. I thought\u2014why not use the blank side of a beak zine for all of the game's content; the tables, questions and prompts you\u2019ll need during play. So that\u2019s what I\u2019m doing.\nIn Bucket of Bolts, you\u2019ll be able to read through all the rules in the booklet and then unfold it into a complete reference for play. Pretty neat huh?\nAnd here it is closing!\nPaper\nExtract comes in a range of lovely colours.\nOf course, I'm still taking every opportunity to make this little zine a deluxe product. I'll be using one of my favourite paper stocks, G.F Smith Extract.\nAs well as having some seriously impressive environmental credentials (it's made from recycled coffee cups), it's also just a lovely paper that comes in some great colours. I\u2019m partial to Mustard, as you can see in the prototype, but we\u2019ll see when the print samples arrive.\n\nInk\nCopies of ARTEFACT, outside on a sunny day.\nAs with my previous projects, I\u2019ll be using Risograph to print the book. That means rich, vivid shades with the aesthetic of screen printing, but viable for large-scale print runs. It\u2019s also one of the most sustainable ways to print, with soy-based inks & low energy machines. It\u2019s going to be beautiful!\n\nIllustration\nTorben is very excellent at drawing spaceships.\nSpeaking of beautiful, I'm also commissioning Torben B\u00f6kemeyer again to do some awesome illustrations for the game. Spaceships are his bread & butter, and I think his sharp, detailed style is a really good fit for this game. You\u2019ll have seen his key art at the top of the page, and he's already hard at work on the game's cover.\n\nCollector\u2019s Edition\nI'm looking forward to an excuse to get wild with paper & ink combos...\nI\u2019m also offering a Collector\u2019s Edition of the game, exclusive to the Kickstarter, packed with bonus printed matter like art prints, stickers and random tables.\nIt\u2019s all paper stuff, but I think it\u2019s gonna feel pretty special.\nAny \u2019game content\u2019 (such as random tables) will be available to all as a digital download.\n\nAccessibility\nLike Artefact and Orbital, the digital edition will also be fully-compatible with screen readers. A second version will also be provided to support a range of visual processing needs. Once again, Yubi will be handling the accessibility design of the digital files.\n\nCommunity Copies\nEvery backer of Bucket of Bolts, physical or digital, will also be contributing one digital copy of the game to be available for free for those who need it. Thanks!\n\nStretch Goals\nThis is intentionally designed as a small project, but I've still got some cool things to announce if we break past our funding goal :)\n\nDelivery.\nTimelines\nI\u2019ve got a draft of the game written, and I\u2019m happy that the core concept works as well for spaceships as it did for magical items (after making a few changes to the design). I\u2019m hoping to get a playtest version out in a month or two, with the full digital version being delivered in late spring/early summer and the physical edition following soon after.\n\nBackerKit\nAs with my previous projects, I\u2019ll be using BackerKit to manage fulfilment. This time, though, I\u2019m collecting shipping fees through Kickstarter so you shouldn\u2019t need to add funds in BackerKit unless you\u2019ve selected add-ons.\n\nOrbital \nOrbital header art\nMy previous project, Orbital, is going to print imminently which means that the bulk of the work for that Kickstarter is done. I\u2019m not shipping out the rewards myself, and the stretch goal content is coming along nicely. I\u2019ll continue to actively manage the project, but barring any catastrophes it shouldn\u2019t take up much headspace.\n\nARTEFACT: Reviews & Remarks.\nI\u2019m so happy with the way Artefact has been received. Here\u2019s hoping I can recapture some of that magic for Bucket of Bolts.\nIf you\u2019re a returning backer: hi, nice to see you again! I hope you also enjoyed Artefact :)\nPrint copies of Artefact\n\"It combines a little bit of writing and a little bit of drawing with a lot of storytelling to make a game that is one of the most relaxing and mindful experiences I have had this year.\" - Shut Up & Sit Down\n\"This is a great system agnostic supplement that could fit on any gamer\u2019s shelf\". \u2014 Pulp Culture Museum\n\"It was a wonderful game that once I started, I had a hard time putting down.

Players deploy recruits into battle, then spend their available action points during each activation. Trigger powerful attacks and abilities from either a deployed recruit itself or from the cards in their hand.\nTo begin play, each player chooses a runelord then everyone chooses one of several game modes. Follow the setup and win conditions found in the Battle Compendium and hit the battlefield!\n\nQUICK OVERVIEW  \nLet's have a look at some gameplay basics:\nACTIONS\nThere are several types of actions that recruits can take during play. All actions will have a cost associated with them and every recruit has access to three action points to spend per activation. If you see an action point icon, simply pay the corresponding point and perform the action shown. \n32mm runelord miniatures available as an add-on! Models do not come painted.\n\nBATTLE DICE\nThere are 5 battle dice in the game, each tiered by color. The higher the tier, the more powerful the dice.\nThe combat system is progressive. The better you roll on the battle dice, the more wounds are dealt and the more varied the attack's effects will be. In the example below, watch how this melee attack gets better as the rolled dice tier increases!  \nTAKING ENDOWMENTS\n  During each warzone activation, players have three options when using Facilitators:\nOption 1: If activating a warzone with a runelord deployed, simply discard any number of Facilitators from your hand during the Endow Phase and increase any rune of your choice by one for each Facilitator discarded in this way.\nOption 2: When activating a warzone with a non-runelord recruit deployed, you may discard a single Facilitator during the Endow Phase and destroy the deployed recruit to increase any rune of your choice by one. If you have another recruit in your hand to deploy, do so, and keep fighting!\nOption 3: During the Active Phase of any recruit you control, you may discard any number of Facilitators from your hand and draw a card for each Facilitator discarded in this way.\nRECAP: Unique Aspects\n Recruit Actions: When you draw into a recruit, if you do not need or want that recruit to be deployed into battle, you can spend them from your hand for their actions just like any other card! Does that Peacekeeper need a ranged attack this turn? Play your Hound Master for her attack action and discard it. This not only creates surprise attacks that your opponents don't see coming, but it is also a great way to free up hand space if you need to draw cards and you are at your max hand size. \n Endowments: Runes allow players to level up mid-combat! Do you need that one extra hex of movement? Good thing you drew that Facilitator. Unlock an endowment of Grace and get there!\n Modular Map Tiles: Do you want to play a small, single-tile battlefield where there's nowhere to run? Select one of six double-sided tiles small enough to bring the battle to a coffee table. Want to play a full-on war with four players? Put all six map tiles together for a 19x27\" double-sided battlefield! [Spoiler: If we are fortunate enough to unlock our second set of double-sided map tiles, they are designed to combine with the core tiles offering two more 38x54\" battlefields! Not recommended for coffee tables.] \n Battle Dice: The progressive battle dice system puts all of the important information during combat into one place. Simply roll the attack's denoted dice and apply the wounds rolled to the target along with any Weak (circle), Strong (triangle), or Critical (star) effects rolled, each effect unique to the attacking recruit! \nThis guide is a work in progress.\nJoin the game designers for this quick overview of combat basics: \n [NOTE: All components shown are prototypes and can change based on your feedback.] \nThink you're ready to give it a shot? Download our demo on Tabletop Simulator!\nAdventures are scenario-based experiences for 1-4 players depending on the selected adventure. Each adventure will have a guide on how to set up the components for play and specific win|lose conditions for players to solve, hindered by the actions taken by AI-driven recruits called villains.\nVILLAINS\nVillains follow a simple series of behaviors that are unique to each villain in the adventure. When activating a villain, simply follow its list of behaviors in the order shown. When they have completed all of their behaviors, their activation is complete.\nLet's have a look at a villain from the adventure, The Unrighteous King:\nAt the top, you will note that this Brute has rulesets for both one or two-player experiences. Every villain will have rulesets that scale its difficulty based on the number of players. In this example, all of this villain's innate actions are listed in the top section while all his behaviors are listed below. When you activate this villain, you would follow its behavior list from behavior 1 through 5 then complete its activation.\nFor a better look at the contents of an adventure, download the demo rulebook below or give it a shot on Tabletop Simulator!   \nThis guide is a work in progress.\nActual prototype shown above.\nThe Sovereignty Stage is an optional game mode where players can take the armies of their favorite runelords and mix them into a resource-management, deck-building engine where players take turns purchasing cards over twelve rounds of play. Purchasing is done from three available markets: The Barracks, The Armory, and The Training Grounds. Along the way, journey cards are drawn where dangerous encounters, exciting events, and aggressive PvP cards can dramatically change the outcome of a player's resources. \nPHASES OF A ROUND\nDRAW: All players draw and reveal five cards.\nJOURNEY: Beginning with the first player, each player draws a single Journey card, then resolves its contents. If the card being drawn has the PvP card back, only that single card is drawn and all players perform its contents together!\nPURCHASE: Beginning with the first player, players may purchase a single card from the available markets or they may pass. After each player has passed or purchased, restock the markets and begin again until all players have either passed or can no longer afford to purchase.\nDISCARD/RESTOCK: All players discard any remaining cards from their hands and restock all markets.\nActual prototype shown above.\nWHY THE DECK BUILDER?\nThough it's optional, the deck builder mode allows players to create countless new combos by mixing their runelord's cards with the cards from other runelords' armies. As new runelords are introduced in future expansion, old runelords will get a new lease on life, expanding the game's replayability for years to come!\nPLAY\n\nNOTE: Battlefield/Adventure Add On is set as an $85k stretch goal.\nActual prototype shown above.\nYou may be asking: \"What is a runelord?\" \nWho better to answer that than the creator himself, author David Farland?\n Here's an interview with David Farland and game design John D'Angelo:\nRunelords take qualities like strength, intelligence, and beauty from their willing vassals. As runelords do this, they became stronger as their vassals become weak and infirm. But there's a catch! The Runelord must keep the vassals safe, lest they lose their powers. \nVIDEOS\nDoug of 2+Tough breaks down what he thinks makes The Runelords stand out.\nMark Streed from Dice Tower goes into the biggest changes from the first campaign. \n Unfiltered Games gives the rundown on The Runelords and gives a live playthrough!\n Not_A_Superhero learns the game in real-time!\nGloryhoundd presents a quick overview of theme and gameplay!\nJoin Mike from One Stop Co-Op Shop as he attempts to tackle The Unrighteous King Adventure solo!\nThe Battle Cast breaks down what makes The Runelords so unique and helps answer the question: Should You Play?  \nThe Hungry Gamer discusses the evolution of The Runelords.   \nARTICLES and PODCASTS\nGabe and John go over the value of community feedback.\nCheck out this interview with Board Game Halv!\nA fun episode where designers John J.

As such, we're well aware of the common bottlenecks in Kickstarter fulfillment. We also are well aware of the supply chain impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nSo with this in mind, here's what we're going to do to make sure you get your game on-time and in mint condition:\n\nWe have an active relationship with our manufacturer. We've had prototypes created and we can vouch for their quality. As soon as the campaign funds, we're ready to manufacture the game. That includes stretch goals too - every single additional goal has been vetted so we can confidently fulfill on-time and within our budget.\n\nSlow shipping is also a common problem. That's why we've chosen our domestic and international shipping partners very carefully. We've scoured online reviews and have contacted some of their current clients to make sure they're up to the task.\n\nHave a concern that you don't see addressed above?

She also noticed that the selection of products offered for water activities lacked sophistication and a cultural connection. Alma Ocean is the first, Black-owned pool inflatable start-up with a mission of promoting inclusivity, creativity, and sustainability through the design and production of inflatable pools and water activity accessories.\nFounder + CEO, Danielle Hodge\n\nCREATIVITY: Inflatable pools should not only cool you off in the Summer, but they should create an experience and set a mood once placed and filled. Alma Ocean offers creative designs that will enhance any outdoor space and serve as the centerpiece to every backyard barbeque or balcony. \n\nSUSTAINABILITY: Alma Ocean believes in protecting the ocean, which is why upcycling is such a priority. Reusing and recycling inflatable pools and water products is a way to alleviate Alma Ocean\u2019s environmental imprint on this Earth. We have partnered with some of the best Upcycling Guru's worldwide to help us accomplish our goal of inflatables being a \"Forever\" product.\n  INCLUSIVITY: We want EVERYONE to enjoy the water and have access to swimming resources at their finger tips.  Alma Ocean offers resources for swimming lessons, surfing groups, and other water activities to encourage EVERYONE to safely get their feet wet. We empower swimmers and non swimmers to navigate through the water with confidence.\n\n WHY CROWDFUNDING:\nAlma Ocean is currently in the crowdfunding phase and early manufacturing phase. We are dedicated to offering countless varieties of inflatable pools and water product designs; however, financial limitations only allow for a small selection of designs to be available at this part of the process. With the help of donations from supporters, the capital raised will be used to manufacture current designs and expand to include additional design concepts for production. The crowdfunding capital is also being used for marketing, graphic designers, product shoots, media, and other production costs. Every dollar raised is a step towards the business goals and mission of Alma Ocean.\n\nWHERE WE PLAN TO GO:\nOnce the crowdfunding goal is reached, the capital received will be allocated in a variety of ways. This includes the production of the inflatable pool and water accessory designs that are currently available, and fulfilling orders generated from crowdfunding supporters. It will also be allocated towards marketing, graphic designers, product shoots, media, and other production costs. Additionally, Alma Ocean will use the capital raised to expand and grow its business. As the business grows, the product designs available will also grow.\nCulture Addict Inflatable Pool - Fits 3 adults comfortably.\nThe future of Alma Ocean is limitless. Its long-term plans include expanding product variety, evolving product design to incorporate innovative engineering, developing consumer connections, and increasing awareness for water safety. Alma Ocean strives to be the resource on everything related to water activities. Whether someone needs to learn how to swim, wants to enhance their swimming experience, or wants to upcycle their current water products, Alma Ocean will be their destination.\nIn production phase\n\nTo say thanks to everyone who makes a contribution to this campaign, we are offering Alma Ocean products through this campaign before we offer them anywhere else. Contribute now and help us create wealth in the black community \u2013 supporting a group of black entrepreneurs who are building a business that means something.\nOther Ways You Can Help\nIn addition to making a monetary contribution to this campaign, you can show your support for what we are doing by sharing a link to the campaign on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, and any other social media platforms you use. The more people hear about Alma Ocean today, the smoother our launch is going to go.

Being in the water is healing for your mind, body, and soul. A little history on our OG leaf float, this one is special to us. We asked our designer to give us something that speaks to culture. He looked up leaf patterns in Africa and BOOM, low and behold the OG leaf float was born. We call this float OG because Its original and unique design left us with no choice but to put it at the top of our list. P.S.

Here lie the remnants of the First Born, an advanced civilization that conquered the galaxy long ago but have since been dormant, waiting for the younger species to take their first steps into space.\nThis sleep wasn\u2019t dreamless, and over the millennia the First Born were slowly driven mad. Fanatical and paranoid, they have learned to fear and despise the new species that they once longed for.\nWhen the Traders arrived in a seemingly abandoned asteroid field to pick over the bones of a long-dead people, the First Born were awoken\u2026\nCore Space: First Born is a sci-fi miniatures board game in which you control a band of Traders venturing into the ancient First Born temples. The game takes place on the highly- detailed 3D board included in the box. Your Traders must explore the area, fulfil their objectives, salvage what they can and then escape back to their ship, spending their earnings on desperately-needed repairs. The exciting campaign system will track your crew from game to game, developing their skills, upgrading their equipment and immersing you in their story.\nFirst Born is based on last year\u2019s cyberpunk bestseller Core Space (see \u2018What is Core Space?\u2019 below for full details) but is a fully standalone starter set playable by new and existing players alike. It retains the same simple core mechanics and our unique \u2018real search\u2019 system while seamlessly integrating this new and mysterious alien race.\nTo find out more about the gameplay, download the rules HERE or check out the playthrough videos further down the page.\nThe Crew of the Eidolon \u2013 these incredible characters are just some of the 32mm scale plastic minis included in the box (supplied unpainted).\nThis time the narrative campaign in the starter set is built for a single crew and playable co-op and solo \u2013 something that\u2019s long been requested for the game! It is of course fully compatible with the existing range of crews and expansions as well as our wide selection of terrain. All Core Space expansions and boosters are modular so you can mix and match them for a fully customisable experience, from a solo RPG-style adventure to a full-on 6-player PvP skirmish.\nTo win you will need to follow the Trader credo:\nSALVAGE // TRADE // ADAPT // SURVIVE\nCore Space is a fully self-contained skirmish game \u2013 everything you need to play the game, including a 2\u2019/60cm square neoprene mat covered in our award-winning modular terrain (no glue or paint required!), is included in the starter set. Established players will be excited to hear that all of the miniatures, terrain and equipment in the box are brand-new, expanding on the huge Core Space universe with never-seen-before settings, characters and stories.\nLet\u2019s find out a bit more about the two pledges on offer:\n You can find Xanadib's latest Pledge Calculator HERE.\nHave you been living under an asteroid?

Genetically engineered to be the most intelligent form of First Born; millions of years without stimulus has atrophied their once-great minds. In a real sense this has reduced them to little more than beasts, but they are extremely powerful and near indestructible.\nThis expansion includes one of these True Gods. It\u2019s the biggest miniature we have ever made for Core Space and stands over 120mm tall! It\u2019s designed to straddle the terrain, representing its phenomenal power to reform the living rock of the surrounding chambers it as it moves. Flanked by its two hulking Guardians and with brand-new missions to tell its story, this is a challenge your Traders can\u2019t afford to miss. \nThe Gates of Ry'sa are a network of interlinked portals to other worlds, times or alternate realities. The gates are not wormholes like Lagrange points nor tears in time and space like Core Space; instead the gates imprint a galactic 'map' on the traveller's own neural network to alter its place in time, space and reality.\nThe First Born primarily use the Gates to travel between asteroids within their own star system, and they keep this technology heavily guarded from intruders\u2026\nThe Gates of Ry\u2019sa is a brand-new expansion to Core Space First Born that adds these gates to the game along with some powerful new First Born threats \u2013 the Talos and the Cerberosa. See Update 11 for full details.\nThe new narrative campaign in the expansion will see your Traders attempt to secure one of these gates for themselves before passing through it to reach yet more undiscovered treasures in the more distant First Born asteroid bases. New equipment and mining opportunities await amongst the incredible new terrain pieces included in this set. The gates are housed in enormous caverns large enough for all manner of creatures to come through, and the shifting colours in the energy pylons make for an eye-catching centrepiece to your gaming table. New event cards shuffled into the deck will represent the reality-shifting nature of the nearby gate.\nThe expansion can be added to your pledge for just \u00a331 (see Add-ons below for full details).\nTrading Post 5 is a waystation hastily established in a crater on an abandoned asteroid just beyond the Lagrange Point. Here an enterprising Captain can hire traders, mercenaries and other useful hands and stock up on fuel, machines, equipment and weapons in a eclectic bazaar of stores, workshops, bars and dens of iniquity.\nThe outpost attracts a colourful assortment of dubious characters and ne'er do wells; exactly the sort of tough, shifty types you'd expect in the final outpost before untold wealth or grisly death!\nTrading Post 5 is a new expansion for Core Space that brings the Traders back out of the asteroid temples and introduces a host of new characterful NPCs. See Update 21 for full details.\nThe new narrative campaign in the expansion will see your Traders visit the Trading Post hoping for a big score from their recently acquired alien loot. They can peruse the stores, meet with contacts, and even recruit new Traders to their cause. However, the aliens that they so rudely awakened have followed them back\u2026 Can they defend the settlement from its attackers trying to reclaim their asteroid home?\nThe new terrain in the set forms part of Trading Post 5 and is made up of shops and cargo in pre-fab containers. The expansion is populated by new NPCs, including Civilians, a lone Galactic Corps agent, the Ganger proprietor of the Trading Post, and four new playable Traders!\nThe expansion can be added to your pledge for just \u00a331 (see Add-ons below for full details).\nTo add an item to your pledge, simply increase the total amount of your pledge by the cost of the item.

The next stage is getting them tooled and produced, with many samples stages along the way to ensure quality. We predict that we will begin shipping in autumn 2021. However, the exact timing is impossible to predict and there is always the potential for delay with products produced in China, especially if any components do not meet our high quality standards during production. We will of course keep our backers up to date as best we can once the project closes.\n\nBy backing this campaign you acknowledge that the final product may vary slightly from the prototypes shown in the images, due to tooling tolerances or artwork improvements during production. We will notify backers of any major changes should they occur.\n\nWe are aiming to deliver this Kickstarter in full in advance of the retail release date.

Be careful though, as an alliance can only last so long. Only one player can be crowned the most victorious. Be ready to strategize, calculate, backstab and deceive the other players to victory.\nEach player takes a set of 5 Ships and 5 Cargo cards in the color of their choice.  Each player places their Cargo in front of themselves in a row, with the value face down.  Players can place their Cargo cards in any order they choose.  Place a Ship card on top of each Cargo card, with the Ship side up.\nShuffle the main deck, deal 5 cards to each player face down.  Place the remaining cards face down in the center of the play area.\nThe player that travelled the furthest today goes first.\nPlayers take turns in clockwise order.  The active player may take any of the following actions in any order.\nPlay a single Crisis card\nPlay Crew cards\nPlay Command cards\nTrade card(s) with other players\n  A player that plays no cards, may discard their entire hand.\nAfter each turn, the active player will check for Crisis that still has a Crisis card attached. If that player ends their turn with a Crisis card attached to a SHIP, that SHIP is destroyed and its Cargo is lost.  The Cargo attached to that Ship will not be counted towards their score at the end of the game. The active player then draws from the Main Deck until they have 5 cards in hand, before proceeding to the next player.\n\n\n\nAfter you complete all of your actions, your turn ends.  Any of your Ships with Crisis cards still attached are now destroyed.  Flip over the affected ship, revealing the destroyed side, leaving the cargo in place underneath it.  Discard the Crisis card and any Crew cards that were attached to that ship.\nDestroyed Ships are out of play for the rest of the game.  The attached Cargo underneath the destroyed Ship must remain concealed and will not count towards your final score.\nAfter removing any destroyed Ships, draw from the main deck until you have 5 cards in hand.\nThe game ends when a single player's entire fleet is destroyed.  Everyone else will score points for Cargo attached to their Ships that are not destroyed.\nPlayers will flip over their undestroyed Cargo and total up the points.  The player with the highest sum of points is the winner.\nIf multiple players have the same sum of points, the player with the most intact Ships wins the tie.  If there is still a tie, the player with the most Crew cards attached to their Ships wins the tie.\nSpace TrailBlazer: Standard Game- Backing this reward will get you a copy of Captain\u2019s Log: Crisis Detected and access to all our unlocked stretch goals with an early bird discount.\nStandard Game - Backing this reward will get you a copy of Captain\u2019s Log: Crisis Detected and access to all our unlocked stretch goals.\nSharing is Caring - Backing this reward will get you two copies of Captain\u2019s Log: Crisis Detected and access to all our unlocked stretch goals.\nShare the Love - Double the fun!

With decision branching, you\u2019ll be able to make choices while you listen that could change your story\u2014just like a Choose Your Own Adventure book. \nForteller\u2019s previous work includes Gloomhaven, Frosthaven, Jaws of the Lion, and The Isofarian Guard. So, your legend is in safe hands!\nListen to a sample of Forteller Games' audio for Bardsung:\nBecause Bardsung can be played as a campaign game, the custom Game Trayz insert (unlocked on Day 1) will keep everything from your core box organised between play sessions\u2014so you can pick up right where you left off.\nImage shown is for illustration purpose only. Actual product may vary due to product enhancement.\nLegends are heroes who have adventures worth singing about.\nIn a world where being sung of by bards is the mark of a true hero, you begin with a single tile, a destination, and the desire to become songworthy. What unfolds is a labyrinthine dungeon of your creation, filled with dangerous enemies, wandering monsters, challenging puzzles, and valuable treasure.\n\nThe immersion of roleplaying games meets the elegance of board game mechanics in an epic 50+ hour campaign. \nInspired by dungeon-crawling and roleplaying classics, Bardsung is a cooperative dungeon explorer for 1-5 players that combines the best elements of both with contemporary gameplay to create a powerful new experience.\nInspire the songs.\nDescend into the depths of an ancient forge, building your dungeon and creating your legend as you explore\u2014with no game master needed. As you venture through the ruined halls, you'll face the strange and terrible creatures that call the darkness home...\nLive your legend.\nFrom your path through the dungeon to the growth of your character into a fabled hero, the decisions you make and directions you take will evolve your story.\nBecome Bardsung.\nWith multiple potential paths through the depths, you can always return to take a different route. Play through again and again, hero. The ancient forge is a warren of secrets waiting to be discovered, and your legend is just beginning!\n Bardsung is a game of pathways. \nFrom your physical journey through the ancient forge to your metaphorical journey of building your character into a fabled hero, your choices define your experience.\nExplore the dungeon in standalone sessions, or as part of a narrative campaign that evolves based on your decisions.\nEach dungeon has a way in and a way out. The journey between is up to you.\nWith swift setup, a procedurally generated dungeon, and easy-to-grasp mechanics taught by an intuitive tutorial-based rulebook, your descent into the depths will be quick...\n\nTo hasten your descent, the hero you choose will have a starting role in the party\u2014but how they progress is up to you. You have the freedom to either follow their suggested path, or create your own bespoke hero with a unique set of traits and arsenal of attack combos.\nRead more on Levelling Up\nA classless path system lets you build the hero you want, your way.

Because each adventure includes its own dungeon and takes around 45-90mins to play, adventures can be played as one shots or as part of a campaign.\nRegardless, the choices you make while exploring will change your story, from the secrets you uncover to the way the adventure ends\u2014which, in campaign play, leads you to the next adventure...\nIn a hidden vault, you\u2019ll find set cards that are unlocked by your choices as your game goes on. Perhaps you find a dwarf prisoner, chained to a wall. Free them, and you\u2019ll draw a numbered card from the vault and shuffle into one of the decks.

Aspect decks evolve with your campaign, and can create lasting and long-ranging effects.\nRead more about the Aspect Decks\nAs you walk the ruined halls, you'll face strange creatures that call the darkness home. \nControlled by simple and intuitive AI, enemy behaviours are varied and quick to resolve. Be wary, for enemy behaviour will change as you move deeper into the forge and your foes adapt to your presence.\nJust like your hero, enemies can level up, evolve their attacks, and can even learn to hold grudges against heroes who defeat them.\nEnter intelligent and dangerous combat featuring cooperative combo play that goes beyond simply moving toward an enemy and rolling dice each turn. \nIn a zone-based system that emphasises freedom of movement, teamwork and positioning are vital to solving the combat puzzles created by battle aspect cards, which are unique to each encounter.\nBattle aspect cards modify combat encounters. Be wary of cards that grant enemies more dangerous attacks, such as poisoned weapons, or add more enemies through either a sudden ambush or time-delayed reinforcements. \nYou'll need to adapt to the changing state of play, hero\u2014but your abilities can't be used over and over, so choose your moment wisely!\nRead more about Combat\nRound length, turns, and enemy activations are governed by a dynamic marching order that will keep you on your toes, encouraging you to adopt strategies that control the ebb and flow of initiative.\nThe marching order determines initiative each round and refreshes each turn. Combat can be unpredictable\u2014the marching order is a second battleground you can use to control the chaos, so manipulate it to your advantage!\nRead more about the Marching Order\nPerform heroic deeds to gain fate that can be used to power special abilities. Any fate you earn is shared amongst your party, so working together is key.\n\nAnd speaking of fate, darkness can descend with the roll of a die. \nAs you build your dungeon, you may find yourself needing to double back\u2014perhaps you missed some loot, or an aspect card triggered an earthquake that blocked your route.\nYet turning back may not be so simple. The dungeon may be yours to explore, but you aren't the only inhabitants. Wandering monsters stalk the halls, their movements signalled by echo tokens that come ever closer. \nKept at bay only by closed doors, the nature of the beast won't be revealed until the last moment...\nRead more about Wandering Monsters and Mini Bosses\nExploration\nCombat\nAspect Decks\nMarching Order\nWandering Monsters\nLevelling Up Heroes\nExample Hero Builds\nWeapons & Equipment\nCampaign System\nAlternative Endings\nMini Bosses\n\nEverything you get in Bardsung: Legend of the Ancient Forge!\n\nWe\u2019ll ship your rewards to one of our international hubs.

Keep in mind that these costs could change based on the total number of stretch goals unlocked during the campaign. Once the campaign is finished and you\u2019ve confirmed your address and any add-ons, your accurate shipping cost will be calculated in the pledge manager.\nSadly, due to customs, import laws, and other restrictions, Steamforged is unable to ship pledge rewards to these locations (see point 10 of terms).\nBecause of the size of the package, we\u2019re also unable to ship to P.O. Boxes.\nKeep in mind that any pledges confirmed after the pledge manager deadline will be shipped from our UK hub at a later date. For non-UK backers, this will likely increase shipping costs.\nFor the regions listed as \u2018friendly shipping\u2019, we cover any VAT or sales tax charges. So, those are accounted for in the pledge price and shipping estimations. \n                                                               Backers in other regions will be liable for any VAT or sales taxes which may be applied in their own countries. There will be no extra costs for VAT charged in the pledge manager.\nBelow is a rough schedule of when you can expect key things to happen once the campaign ends. This schedule should give you an idea of when your payment card will be charged, and when shipping is likely to begin. Because circumstances are different from project to project, this timeline is estimated based on our experience.\nWe want to get your rewards into your hands as soon as possible. Because of the potential for unexpected effects on planning and production schedules, there\u2019s a chance you might not get your rewards before the game is available at retail.

You can then spend the Credits to do extra actions.\nThe Ghost Piece expansion adds 24 new puzzles with unique shapes and new reward mechanics. There are also 3 new types of level-5 pieces, the Ghost Pieces. This expansion enhances the replayability of Project L and opens new strategic options for you to explore.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to get the Add-ons?

It\u2019s because of your continuous involvement and interest in our games that we amass enough energy and motivation to push our projects further ahead. As a thank you, we\u2019re including a special promo pack in all our Kickstarter campaigns that our ambassadors get for free!\nYou will automatically receive Project L: Finesse Ambassador Pack for free if:\nYou have pledged during the first 72 hours of the campaign,\nYou have supported any of our previous Kickstarter campaigns, or\nYou were subscribed to our newsletter before this Kickstarter campaign launched.\n\n  Looking back to the original campaign in 2018, Project L went a long way. Two years ago, thanks to the support of all the amazing backers, we've fully unlocked all Stretch Goals that allowed us to produce the game in a shape and quality we had never dreamed of. There's not much that could be added or upgraded \u2014 just look at what the backers and reviewers say!\nWhen it comes to the Finesse expansion, we had no other option than to follow the quality of Project L & Ghost Piece (not that we wouldn't like that), so Finesse is already coming to Kickstarter in a super-maximized mode.\nWe prefer to not add anything superficial, untested, or not fitting the content that's been originally planned for the game. And since mostly everything has been already added to the game, the inevitable result is that this campaign is Stretch Goal free.\nOn the other hand, the journey towards making Project L a reality has been so exciting that we just love the idea of sharing it with you in full detail (in even more detail than that the backers of the original campaign remember!). To accomplish that, we\u2019ve prepared a series of behind-the-scenes stories as well as making-of interviews.\nStay tuned for the project updates!\nSince the original campaign from 2018, we\u2019ve partnered with Paul Grogan from Gaming Rules!, a professional rulebook writer & editor, to enhance and streamline the way you can learn to play Project L. Furthermore, focusing on the feedback we\u2019ve received since the first version of the game, we\u2019ve also perfected the rules in terms of game mechanics\u2014mostly concerning the player actions and endgame. \nCheck out the Revised Rules 2.0 (WIP).\nPrinted Revised Rulebook (2.0):\n comes automatically with all pledge levels! So, if you're a backer of the original campaign and are now pledging for the Returning Backer rewards (just the Finesse expansion), you'll receive the physical revised rulebook 2.0 as well.\nincludes the rules of Project L (base game) and all expansions in a single book.\nincludes updated player aids,\nis printed on premium soft-touch paper (that you know from the original campaign).\nis available in English only (see below for more details).\nWe're proud to announce that Asmodee will localize and manufacture Project L (base game) and also distribute it in retail.\nIf you're interested in a localized retail version of the base game, get in touch with your local branch of Asmodee for details about if/when they are releasing Project L in your country and/or language. Since the localization is now in the hands of Asmodee, we're no longer allowed to produce non-English versions of the game.\nPlease note, however, that the retail version by Asmodee and this Kickstarter version by Boardcubator are two separate product lines run by two separate companies. While there's a good chance that the content of one will be compatible with the other, we cannot guarantee that.\nShipping will be charged after the campaign through a pledge manager.\nFriendly Shipping \u2014 We offer friendly shipping to the EU, US, UK, Canada, Australia, China, Hong Kong, Macao, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, South Africa, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam. Backers from these regions won't spend additional money on customs or other import fees. Based on any given region, we will either ship your reward directly from within the country or will fully cover all potential import fees you might get charged for. \nAdditional Copy Shipping Discount \u2014 If you're interested in getting an additional copy of Project L or one of the expansion, you will spare on shipping for the subsequent copy thanks to reduced rates. Check the table for the discount.\n\nIf you're interested in getting an additional copy of the game, check out the Shipping section for shipping discounts.\nBigger Groups \u2014 If you\u2019d like to pledge for even more copies, get in touch with us at sales@boardcubator.com and we'll get back to you with a special offer.\nJan \"Suki\" Soukal \u2014 Co-founder of Boardcubator who left his day job in IT security a few years ago to become an independent board game creator.

However, we believe that with the experience we have from the previous campaigns, we will successfully overcome any obstacles that might come up.\n\n\u20ac1 PLEDGE \u2014 If you aren\u2019t decided which pledge level you want, just rewrite the pledge amount to \u20ac1.

Rulebooks, game boxes, player aids, and puzzle boards have scratch resistant varnish or lamination that ensures that these components will last a long time under frequent use. Based on hundreds of rounds of playtesting, we have gradually improved the technological aspect of puzzle boards into their current 5-layer structure.\n\nThe base game is readily expandable without the need to make any component changes or upgrades to the base game that would require releasing a new version of the game. All expansions of the game can be mixed together.\nReusability and recyclability\nGiven the durability and material quality of the components in the game, Project L will last a long time before it starts showing signs of use or general material deterioration. In the rare case a component gets damaged, we will provide replacement parts.\nSustainable materials\nProject L holds Verification of Conformity according to the EU Toy Safety Directive 2009/48/EC, which declares the game as safe for children and parents to play with and also verifies that there are no physical / mechanical, flammability, or chemical risks.\nEnvironmentally friendly factories\nPanda GM, the manufacturer of Project L pays extreme attention to worker comfort and safety standards with a fully air-conditioned environment, while being BSCI social compliance certified and following the OHSAS requirements for occupational health and safety.\nSustainable Distribution\nBased on our previous experience with successfully fulfilling Kickstarter projects, we are constantly optimizing the shipping routes to make sure that the distance the game travels is as short as possible. We use several distribution hubs and fulfillment companies to make sure that packages are shipped in bulk where possible before the last mile delivery to our backers.

For this reason, we have carefully selected our manufacturers and with them we are committed to optimizing and defining every single content of the Soulgivers box according to high standards, both for the prints and for the game elements.\n\nWe give particular importance to the chosen finishes and materials, because we want the visual and physical aspect of the game to be part of the experience itself. But we are also putting all of our energies into this project. All of our energies go to a collaboration with an Italian company that has been dealing with imports for over 40 years, which financed the first prototypes and financially supported Soulgivers to get to where we are today. With their experience, we are confident that we can better manage any aspect of production and imports from China, with the upmost attention to safety, with Quality Control on site. \n\nWe believe in our project so much that we have opened a company dedicated to the design of board games, operational since July 2020: Gravity Games. \n\nMoreover, today Soulgivers is already in an advanced phase of its production.

See the FAQ for estimated shipping costs.\nFailure to complete your BackerKit survey by the deadline (which will be announced in a Kickstarter update once the pledge manager opens) will result in a refund and removal from the project. We cannot allow projects to remain open forever; we must set firm deadlines so that we can properly close campaigns.\nIf you wish, you may choose to use a fulfillment service. This allows you to pledge for the project and then provide us with a U.S. address for delivery of your rewards. Forwarding from the fulfillment service, as well as any local fees, is your responsibility when using a fulfillment company.\nINTERNATIONAL DELIVERY NOTE: No physical rewards are offered to international backers. If the project closes successfully, we will offer the Random Fun Generator book through Amazon's print-on-demand service*, which will make it cheaper for you to purchase the print books (shipping will cost a lot less).\nWe continue to search for reliable, economical solutions to international Kickstarter delivery.\n* As a perfect-bound book, not a wire-bound title.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nSteve Jackson Games is an established game publisher with a successful track record and we have enough Kickstarter experience to deal with issues should they arise.

To reduce the chance of delays, we are limiting physical rewards to U.S. only.\n\nNow it's time for you to tell us whether or not to complete the project.

See below for the full box contents.\nDeep Space D-6: Armada is a stand-alone multi-player sequel to the original solitaire game Deep Space D-6.\nIn Deep Space D-6: Armada, you and up to 3 friends will work together to complete missions, fight enemy fleets in ship to ship combat, and ultimately defeat an evil federation. \nYou'll get stronger as the game progresses, building the perfect starship from over 50 station modules, hiring heroes from a pool of more than 30 unique units, and finding resources to help you dismantle your opposition. \nArmada is a complex and deep game made simple and intuitive through visual and user experience design. If you've played Deep Space D-6 before, you'll be immediately familiar with the mechanics of Armada. If you're new to the series- I hope you're ready for tough decisions and tactical planning! \nDeep Space D-6: Armada is played over a series of game rounds. Each round consists of three phases:\n\n1) Planning: Players perform actions to travel between planets and prepare for upcoming tasks such as upgrading their ships or hiring Heroic crew.\n2) Encounter: Players complete Away Missions or combat enemy fleets at their current location (together or alone).\n3) Resolution: Event and Threat Detected cards are drawn and hazard effects are resolved. \n Learn more about the game in upcoming updates:\nThe Starships (Update #2)\nStations Modules and Weapons (Update #4)\nCrew and Special Abilities (Update #6)\nTeam-Up encounters (Update #8)\nRule Book\nWant to know more? Check out the prototype rulebook. This is a work-in-progress rulebook and is subject to change. \n PHASE 1: Planning\nTravel, repair, upgrade ship, hire crew.\nPLAY\n\nPHASE 2: Encounter\nShip-to-ship combat and Away Missions.\nPLAY\n\nPHASE 3: Resolution \nDraw new event cards, spawn enemies, resolve hazard effects.\nPLAY\n\nCreating a science fiction world where the primary color wasn't black proved to be a large challenge. As a lover of classic science fiction, I was drawn to the bright colors and \"loudness\" of pulp era sci-fi. A true test of Armada's visual direction came from designing the board- or lack thereof. \nA space themed game without the empty blackness of space almost felt wrong, and for some people they probably won't be able to get over it! So Armada uses free floating planet tiles making whatever surface you play on the core color of the \"board\". Still want that dark sci-fi feel? Play on a neoprene star field map. Want to feel like you're floating in space? Try a glass table! \nFor the art, I've enlisted in the help of Gareth Davies. Gareth's unique art style creates a vibrant science fiction world while keeping things minimal and clean. \nFor the components themselves, I aimed for a classic board game look with a slight vintage feel. There are over 50 custom dice in this game!  We're taking advantage of new manufacturing technologies, but don't want to go overboard with component gimmicks. \nGet the full game as a $2 add-on!\nJUMPSHIP is a hidden identity party game for 5-10 players. You can get a copy of the mini-version for $2 with your Armada pledge. Just add $2 to you pledge. See the update for more info (Not available by itself. Limit 1 copy per copy of Armada).\nNo stretch goals. Tau Leader Games does not do Kickstarter exclusives. We fully develop our games and don't piece parts out to be added as stretch goals later.\nBut with your help and community feedback, I've been able to redesign and upgrade the shield and hull trackers! They look like this now:\nOther upgrades:\nA dedicated solo scenario meant for quicker play.\nCustom plastic insert for the hero dice.\nBlack Core cardstock on all cards.\nDrawstring bag for beacon tokens.\nPrinted player pawns (instead of stickers)\nShipping will be charged after the campaign in the pledge manager. Thanks to the funding progress of this campaign, I've been able to lower shipping rates.\nGames will be shipped though fulfillment partners primarily in Canada, China, the EU, the US, and Australia. This should reduce custom fees and VAT. Shipping rates are partially subsidized. \nBackers are limited to 3 total games per pledge. You may add up to 2 additional copies by adding $48 for each additional game to your pledge. There will be no extra shipping charge for extra copies. \nFor larger orders (cases of 6+) or retailer pledges, please inquire by sending a message to the creator.\nTabletop games are becoming more and more popular every year. We as consumers (and designers too!) employ platitudes and conjecture comparing the increased complexity and immersion of board games to the capabilities of video games. If we are to make these comparisons, we must also recognize the dangers of any consumer-focused game mediums. Publishers have a responsibility to be morally accountable for any practices that manipulate fans, deceive consumers, or incite misbehavior among those that partake in our hobby. Deceptive pricing schemes, endless boxes of collectible miniatures, nickel & dime expansion structures, undisclosed kickbacks, even player toxicity- these are just a few areas of growing concern within the emerging tabletop industry. Please take a moment to consider how your purchasing habits and use of games reflect on the industry, whether it is my games or someone else's. \nNever forget that tabletop games are a place for communion, self-expression, can have positive effects on our health and mind, and can lead to wonderful careers and societal impact. As an independent publisher I'm committed to creating games that respect players, and delivering them with practices that are healthy for the community. \nHave fun and play nice. \nJoin the Armada today!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nDeep Space D-6: Armada is my most ambitious and largest game to date. Though the game is already designed, we continue to balance and add new features. There is also a non-trivial amount of art assets to be completed. These things will take time. \n\nThis will be my 6th Kickstarter game project. I've been all over the place- let me tell you. From last-second funding escapades to projects far exceeding my own projections and everything in between. This means I've also seen failures and made mistakes. I've been late to hit deadlines. I've been unresponsive when I needed communication the most. I take full responsibility for my actions and hope people will be fair in judgement and understanding. I am fully aware that being an individual does not necessitate leniency in a market full of large companies and publishers with impressive capabilities. Let's just do our best to be reasonable and keep the spirit of independent self-publishing alive!\n\nTauLeaderGames has a 100% delivery rate but every project still has inherent risks. October 2020 is my best estimate for a project of this scope based on my past experience. While this timeframe includes room for errors and overages, it doesn't encapsulate every possible obstacle.

Play as one of four street urchins each with their own book and a different talent that will make your personal experience differ from that of the other players.\n Play multiple cases (4) as you explore the mean streets of London and experience hours of case-solving fun.\n A multi-player gamebook experience... if you always wished you could share your gamebook experiences with your friends than you are going to absolutely love our cooperative Graphic Novel Adventures games and this game takes it to a whole new level.\nSo how does it all work?\nSherlock has some casework for the Irregulars. It is up to you, to prove your worth.\nYou'll each choose one of the four Irregulars (it is ok if you have fewer players and only choose some, or even one!).\nWiggins has begun to master the art of deduction under Holmes's tutelage.\nMyrtle is a master of disguise and can help the Irregulars slip past all but the most observant.\nIke is particularly good at throwing a beatdown on foes of the Irregulars, or providing some muscle.\nVicky is an expert at climbing and acrobatics, allowing her to spot things for the group.\nNow you are ready to play! Select a Mission from the mission book and set out across London to solve the mystery.\nPlayers will need to be on the lookout for how their special skill can help the group.\nClick to see a larger version!\nAfter you've completed a mission decide to move on to the next or save your place and continue later.\nFor the first time, you can see where it all began. The entire line of Sherlock GNAs take place after the famed dive off of Reichenbach Falls, where Sherlock and Moriarty allegedly plunged to their deaths. Now you can see what happened after those incredible events, and how Sherlock got back in the investigatory saddle, through the eyes of his trusted friend, Dr. Watson.\nSherlock trusts you to prove your deductive prowess and solve cases that have left Inspector Lestrade, and Scotland Yard, puzzled to say the least. Be careful though, not only are your investigations perilous, but Sherlock himself has little tolerance for failure. However you choose to go about solving the mysteries, as always, it's your story, your choices, and your adventure.\nWe want to make this as simple as possible, so there are just three options for pledging.\nWe know it's holiday season, and many of us are running around looking for the perfect gift still.

We have this handy holiday certificate for you, so you can have something to give one of those special people in your life while they wait to crack the case on Baker Street.\nClick on the image for a Hi-Res download.\nThe game has multiple missions to experience.

Equipped for a twenty-year voyage, she will carry the Travellers on an epic journey from Charted Space to the edge of the Orion Arm. Deepnight Revelation must forge a path through uncharted systems and the territory of unknown alien races. Everything she finds will be new, and if she meets with disaster there will be no rescue.\nDeepnight Revelation\u2019s destination is a mysterious radio source at the mouth of the Great Rift. Described in the ravings of a madwoman as the place beyond everything, Terminus Point holds a terrible secret. Reaching it is only part of the mission; at Terminus Point the Travellers will face a desperate battle to prevent mass extinction on a galactic scale, and literally go further than any Traveller has gone before.\nWhat is Inside?\nThe Deepnight Revelation box set will initially contain four books, a card deck and a huge poster map, but stretch goals will unlock additional hardbacks to expand the campaign, covering new adventures and regions of space that the Deepnight Revelation will travel through.\nDeepnight Legacy - a 32 page adventure that introduces the Travellers to their mammoth task.\nCampaign Guide - a 104 page book that lays out the immense scope of the campaign.\nReferee's Handbook - a 96 page book that guides the referee gently through the herculean task of running the campaign.\nTerminus Point - a 72 page adventure into the most distant and fantastical realms that forms the great finale of the Deepnight Revelation campaign!\nA giant poster map featuring deck plans of the Deepnight Endeavour, along with crew departments, while the reverse has a huge scale map depicting the expected route of the journey along the Great Rift and known points of interest.\nA deck of cards, covering Mission Briefings, Standing Orders, and Mission Roles.\nMost of the writing for the Deepnight Revelation box set is complete and you can download the first adventure included in the set (a work in progress, but fully playable), Deepnight Legacy, right HERE.\nDeepnight Legacy: The deep-rift outpost at Point XF-1402 has gone silent. Sent to investigate, the Travellers come under attack from the shambling remains of the crew. As the nature of the threat becomes apparent the Travellers face a terrible choice. They must ensure an alien entity never reaches an inhabited planet\u2026 even if it means they can never leave.\nCampaign Guide: A complete guide to the exploration cruiser Deepnight Revelation and her mission. The Campaign Guide details the Deepnight Entity and the ten year voyage to its hiding place at Terminus Point, the route of Deepnight Revelation and the regions of space she will pass through, along with incidents and adventures that will befall the intrepid crew.\nReferee's Handbook: The Referee\u2019s Handbook contains all the rules and information the referee needs to run an epic campaign of exploration at this magnitude. Using a resolution cycle developed specifically for this campaign, along with advanced rules for whole-crew endeavours, the Referee\u2019s Handbook makes resolving large scale tasks quick and simple. Whether the Travellers are decoding alien hieroglyphs, putting down a mutiny aboard their ship, or trying to prevent a critical system breakdown, the Referee\u2019s Handbook covers every eventuality.\nTerminus Point: At the mouth of the Great Rift lies Terminus Point. There, on the very edge of the spiral arm, the Travellers confront something that will consume all life in the galaxy. They have only the resources of their battered ship and weary crew; backup is a decade away even if the Travellers could call for help. They will fight with what they have, treading a thin line between extinction and revelation.\nWhy Kickstarter?\nTraveller veterans will be familiar with the massive Pirates of Drinax campaign. When we came up with the idea for Deepnight Revelation, we knew it had vast potential that could be developed into a truly epic gaming experience with multiple side plots and new areas of space - making it perfect for a Kickstarter project.\nThe box set will contain the beginning and ends of the campaign, along with guidance for the referee to run exploration campaigns as the Travellers make their way along the Great Rift. However, Kickstarter gives us a chance to expand this greatly with specific adventures and regions of space to be encountered along the way, turning this into the greatest voyage made outside of Charted Space!\nThe 'Feels'\nWhen we embarked on this project, we knew we wanted to create something truly special. Your Travellers will be going far, far beyond Charted Space and we wanted to get across to them the true, terrible majesty of the universe. They will encounter and interact with black holes, neutron stars, and nebulae, while visiting hellworlds and planets lit dimly by a brown dwarf. This will be a trip like no other, and we wanted to make sure Travellers remembered it for the rest of their gaming lives, something that is far more than a simple episodic 'five year mission' style of game.\nTo that end, we have drawn upon many sources for inspiration, and recommend referees immerse themselves in the likes of the Cosmos TV series (both new and original), and films such as Sunshine and Interstellar. On a big 4k screen with full surround sound.\nThis is what we want your Travellers to experience during this campaign.\nYou can hear writer Martin Dougherty's thoughts on the campaign and contents of the box right here:\nPledge Levels\nThere are just three main pledge levels in this Kickstarter project - select the one that appeals to you most and we will soon have Deepnight Revelation in your hands.\nThe Deepnight Revelation Commemorative Pack\nCitizens of the Third Imperium will be able to purchase a special commemorative pack to support the Deepnight Revelation mission - and now you can too, simply by choosing to pledge at the Deepnight Revelation Officer level!\nIn the commemorative pack, you will find:\nThe unique Deepnight Revelation cloth mission patch\nA pad of blank Subsector Maps, ready for your exploration\nSix Deepnight Endeavour pencils, perfect for your players\nOne Deepnight Endeavour pen, because referees are worth it\nThe Deep Space Phenomena Recognition Pack, 24 postcard-sized aids picturing and detailing the mysteries of the universe\nA boxed set of 20 brand new Deepnight Endeavour dice\nAll in an official and attractive presentation pack (seriously, if you are a Traveller collector, you will not want to miss this one!)\nStretch Goals\nWe have a multitude of star systems and strange phenomena to explore, and we will be bringing you the deep mysteries of the galaxy via hardback books that explore specific regions of deep space and add additional adventures to the campaign.\n The Riftsedge Transit: We have added a new hardback book detailing the first leg of the mission! The Riftsedge Transit is exploration writ large, in which the Travellers will encounter new alien races and discover wonders never seen before. They will stand amid the ruins of a vanished civilisation and perhaps learn its fate, follow clues to the home of a starfaring species and launch a daring rescue to save new friends, then face a mature Deepnight Entity controlling a whole world, and learn the true power of their enemy.\nThe Near Side of Yonder: A hardback covering a region of 15 sectors directly spinward of Terra has been unlocked, in which the Travellers encounter three starfaring races which stand on the brink of war. The way forward is through their territory and helping one race will antagonise the others, perhaps triggering a devastating conflict, but the Travellers need allies and information. They could tread a careful path through local politics or turn the weapons of Deepnight Revelation upon any who oppose them.  Finally, the Travellers learn of a fleet assembling to tackle an enemy super-warship... and that they are the target. The Travellers' actions will determine if they face overwhelming odds or merely a tough fight.\nThe Crossing: A new hardback book that will see the Travellers searching for a way across the bulge where the Great Rift starts to curve rimward has been unlocked! However, the route is dangerous and a single mistake will doom the crew to a slow death in deep space. They must brave the greatest hazards of deep space; flaring stars, gravitational anomalies, and a deathtrap planet. The Travellers find evidence of those who trod this path before and learn more about the mysterious Leviathan, before reaching the distant shore. What appears to be a safe haven turns out to be even more deadly than the crossing, but there can be no turning back now.\nThe Far Side of Nowhere: The fourth expansion for the Deepnight Revelation campaign has been unlocked now we have reached the heady heights of \u00a365,000. By this time Deepnight Revelation is in poor condition and her crew weary. No sign has been seen of starfaring aliens for months, until a small outpost is discovered. The alien operators seem to find the Travellers familiar. Whilst they are puzzling over this, a trade ship arrives at the outpost. The crew are human. The Far Side of Nowhere represents a change of pace in the Deepnight Revelation campaign; a chance to return to some old-fashioned Traveller adventures. However, the stakes are higher than usual \u2013 a mis-step could terminate the expedition or force its abandonment.\nVoidshore: Voidshore has been unlocked! This book begins with a transit from the Far Side of Nowhere but focuses on exploration of the very fringe of the spiral arm. As the Travellers explore the region they become aware of another expedition in the area, leading to a tense encounter with other explorers. Whether these rivals become allies or enemies depends very much on the Travellers\u2019 attitude to them.\nThe overall theme in Voidshore returns to one of exploration and discovery, with the Travellers piecing together clues to find the route of a Droyne expedition. Finally, all preparations made, the Travellers stand on the edge of the spiral arm and plot a jump out into the unknown. Ahead lies Terminus Point and the final destination of their mission.\nExpeditions: If we reach the appropriately astronomical heights of \u00a3100,000, we will add Expeditions, the sixth Deepnight Endeavour hardback expansion. Expeditions (a working title!) is a set of adventures designed to be slotted into any portion of the mission, where the crew of the Deepnight Endeavour meet new civilisations, explore fascinating stellar phenomenon and, maybe, gain a few things that will aid them in their epic voyage.\nTraveller Packages\nDuring past Traveller Kickstarter projects, we offered various existing Traveller books so backers could fill the gaps in their collections. The Traveller range is starting to grow quite nicely, and so we have put together a range of Traveller Packages that will allow you to add to your pledge and get these books as soon as the Kickstarter is complete (no waiting around for Deepnight Revelation to be printed!).\nSimply choose which packages you are after and add their cost to your current pledge level. After the Kickstarter is complete, you will receive a survey asking you to confirm which packages you added, and we will send you these books within the next four weeks, along with their PDFs! ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have always delivered on our Kickstarter projects and if you were to ask one of our previous backers of previous Traveller projects such as The Great Rift, the Element Class Cruiser Blueprints or JTAS, we believe you would hear that the quality of our Kickstarter projects is always worth it, and you tend to end up with more than you originally pledged for!\n\nThat said, we have taken steps to ensure Deepnight Revelation does not overrun its projected completion date.\n\nFor a start, much of the work has already been done on the box set, and the first adventure in the set has already entered the art and layout process - you can freely download what has been completed for free using the link above.\n\nSecond, we have brought in fan favourite Martin J Dougherty, to pen the campaign.

It has such a fun feeling while playing, it\u2019s light-hearted, it plays solo, it plays up to 4 and you can talk a lot of smack while laying out Traps. In a lot of ways, it\u2019s the perfect roll and write to play at the pub or with the brunch bunch.\"\n\n\nBoardgames & Bourbon shows off Deadly Doodles and notes that the game is for a younger crowd . . . agreed!

For this campaign, international delivery is estimated as up to three months after United States delivery due to the complexity and time required to transport packages from the U.S. to other nations.

For a very limited time, the datasphere is revealing secrets. Backers only: check out this update to access the vertice and see what secrets the datasphere is revealing!\n\n\nExplore a vast new realm. Uncover never-before-revealed secrets of how the ancients shaped the Ninth World. Face the legacy of those secrets\u2014and, possibly, the utter destruction of the Ninth World.\nThe Numenera: Liminal Shores Kickstarter seeks to fund three thematically linked, hardcover sourcebooks containing all new material for the award-winning phenomenon of the Numenera tabletop RPG. \nOver a billion years into the Earth's future, great civilizations have risen and fallen, each attaining wonders beyond our wildest dreams and furthest imaginings. The remnants of these civilizations shaped the Ninth World into a beautiful but weird place of both wonder and danger. \nYou have explored ruins of the ancient past and found the magic there called the numenera. You have wandered the Steadfast and the Beyond, to discover cities and peoples you never knew existed. You have dived the ocean deeps and found that there, too, lie wonders of the past. Perhaps you have even followed in the footsteps of the prior worlds and voyaged to the stars, or beyond. \nBut the Ninth World still has more unexplored places. One of them is all around us, even now. It\u2019s a network of ancient information, sustained by machines far above our heads circling the world far overhead. And it\u2019s much more than that. It is knowledge and secrets, but it\u2019s also a sort of place. A conceptual space. The datasphere.\nUp until now, people have only caught glimmers of the datasphere. But recently access points, called vertices, have been discovered. Those who find these access points can use them to explore a metaphysical space and plumb the depths of its mysteries. Further, they can use them to learn of new discoveries in the real world. Whole new lands to explore. And even to uncover the mysteries of the prior worlds, and the grand actions that took place aeons ago, affecting the Earth, the Sun, and the other planets. Actions that have an impact\u2014perhaps a massive impact\u2014on our world today.\nNumenera is a game about exploration and discovery. The three new hardcover books offered in this Kickstarter campaign give you all-new methods of exploration and incredible discoveries to be made. They will take your campaign to new heights while embracing the game\u2019s core focus. \nThis Kickstarter will help us launch three new hardcover sourcebooks for Numenera:\nVoices of the Datasphere\nNo other aspect of the Ninth World evokes as much wonder\u2014and generates as many questions from Numenera players\u2014as the datasphere. This hardcover sourcebook delves into the datasphere, making its mysteries yours to command!\nVoices of the Datasphere opens up a whole new aspect of game play, where characters interface with and explore the reaches of the datasphere. This strange new metaspace is not just an ancient alien data network, but in fact multiple such networks\u2014some damaged, incomplete, or aged or evolved past their original purpose\u2014created by myriad civilizations and interacting in unexpected ways. The datasphere offers knowledge to be learned, treasures to be discovered, and wholly new challenges to be overcome. \nLiminal Shore\nThis hardcover Numenera sourcebook offers a new land in the Ninth World, discovered only through clues found in the datasphere. What new people live there? What wonders do they command? Do they know more about the mysterious prior worlds than you do? Do they have cyphers and artifacts never before seen by anyone from the Steadfast or the Beyond? Liminal Shore will offer answers to all these questions, plus new creatures, new NPCs, and new adventures for your Numenera campaign. Be the first to explore a whole new land!\nEdge of the Sun\nThe sun\u2019s luminosity is increasing: a billion years from now, it should have all but swallowed the Earth. So how does the Ninth World even exist? And what happened to the planet Mercury? How, and why, was our world engineered to survive this long?\nThe beings of the prior worlds clearly did . . . something. And now, thanks to discoveries made in the datasphere, the PCs can find out what happened unimaginably long ago, and how those discoveries are vitally important to events transpiring even now.\nEdge of the Sun offers a jaw-dropping, entirely new adventuring locale out in the infinite void, and thrilling, epic, adventures that potentially affect the entirety of the Ninth World itself. Although it can be a part of any Numenera campaign, if you were ever looking for an incredible finale, this would fit the bill!\nAnd perhaps, with stretch goals, we will unlock even more books and additions to the game . . . \n\nWe have a lot of great rewards in this campaign, depending on what level you choose when you back us.\nNEW TO THE NINTH WORLD: This is a great level to take if you're just discovering Numenera and want to give it a try. The Numenera Starter Set has everything you need to start playing, and because it's an existing product, we'll ship your copy within weeks of the close of this campaign. But note: This backer level doesn't include the titles we're funding through this Kickstarter. To get those, you'll need to add them on (see Add-Ons, below). Or for the best deal, choose a different level and then add on the Numenera Starter Set.\nALL THREE PDFS: This is the level to choose if you just want the PDFs of the key titles being funded by this campaign.\nINTO THE DATASPHERE: Choose this level if you want PDFs of the three key titles from this campaign, plus PDFs of the follow-up titles that we hope to unlock through stretch goals. (If you've seen our Kickstarter campaigns in the past, you know we usually unlock a number of additional titles.) For the best deal, though, ONTO LIMINAL SHORES gives you all the same titles in print and PDF.\nALL THREE BOOKS: This is the level to choose if you want the hardcovers of the key titles\u2014plus you also get the PDFs.\nONTO LIMINAL SHORES: Choose this level if you want both the PDF and print versions of three key titles from this campaign, as well as all of the follow-up titles we hope to unlock through stretch goals. Who knows how far the campaign will go and what will get added by the end? (If you've seen our Kickstarter campaigns in the past, you know this will become a great deal.)\nAUTOGRAPHS: The same great deal as ONTO LIMINAL SHORES, but you get a hand-signed autographed bookplate with each book.\nPLAYTEST AND EARLY ACCESS: Just like with the ONTO LIMINAL SHORES level, you get everything this campaign unlocks, but you also get early access to the material and autographed bookplates for each title. Basically, you\u2019ll get the material when the playtesters do, and if you want you can provide feedback from your playtests like they do. You\u2019re not obligated to do so, though\u2014you can also just select this level and gain access to the manuscripts early. \nRetailers: The LIMINAL RETAILER level is a flexible way for you to decide how many Numenera products are right for your store, and to avoid tying up lots of cash between now and release. Your pledge gets you two copies each of the three titles funded by this campaign (Voices of the Datasphere, Liminal Shore, and Edge of the Sun). You may, at a later time, increase the quantity of these titles, and add additional titles funded by stretch goals. You\u2019ll pay for those additional titles, at a retail-friendly discount, at that time. It is likely (but not guaranteed) that you will get them ahead of street date, and you are welcome to begin selling them immediately. In addition to those books, you get a free deluxe Numenera point-of-purchase promo kit. For this retail backer level only, MCG covers domestic US shipping. \n\nAdd-ons are additional items you add to your reward level. Simply increase your pledge by the appropriate amount. After the campaign ends, we\u2019ll get in touch with you about the extra money you pledged and what it was for. Some of these add-on items are only available through this Kickstarter campaign\u2014if you want them, be sure to add them to your pledge now!\nIMPORTANT NOTE \"SHIPS ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD\" is Kickstarter's way of saying that backers anywhere can support our project. It does not mean free shipping. We collect the cost of shipping at the time of reward fulfillment.\nREWARD REDEMPTION AND FULFILLMENT Because we will be shipping rewards at several times over the course of several months, our fulfillment process may be different than other campaigns you\u2019ve backed.\nA few weeks after this campaign ends, we will invite you to review your pledge on BackerKit. This allows you to confirm your pledge and add on anything that you might have missed. Although we use BackerKit to organize backers, pledges, and add-ons, we don\u2019t fulfill rewards through them. Instead, your rewards from this Kickstarter campaign will be fulfilled through the MCG Shop, which ensures that we always have your up-to-date address at the time we ship a reward. It also lets you, the backer, redeem them at your convenience. \nHere\u2019s a brief look at how it works: when your rewards are ready, we\u2019ll notify you by email. You\u2019ll log on to your already existing MCG Shop account, or (if this is your first MCG Kickstarter/purchase) you\u2019ll create an account on the MCG Shop using the email address you gave us in BackerKit. Once you\u2019ve logged on to your MCG Shop account, you\u2019ll go to your Coupons page, and you\u2019ll see coupon code(s) that make your reward(s) free. You\u2019ll decide when to redeem your rewards, and\u2014if your rewards include physical products\u2014to what address to have them shipped. You may delay redemption of your rewards for up to one year after the product\u2019s release date.\nIf you move between reward shipments, you won\u2019t need to tell us, since you\u2019ll simply enter your new address the next time you redeem a reward. If this is a gift and you want to ship it directly to the recipient, simply enter the recipient\u2019s shipping address as the Ship To address when you redeem your reward.\nAll backers (domestic and international) will pay for shipping when they redeem their rewards. We\u2019ll offer a variety of domestic and international shipping methods from which you will choose when you redeem your rewards.\nDOMESTIC SHIPPING You\u2019ll pay for shipping when you redeem your rewards. There will be several shipping options from which to choose. Your rewards will ship from our fulfillment center in the United States.\nINTERNATIONAL SHIPPING International shipping is expensive. We don\u2019t have any control over that, and we can\u2019t accurately predict what shipping rates will be at the time of fulfillment. \nYou\u2019ll pay for shipping when you redeem your rewards. Please be aware that you are responsible for import duties, taxes, and brokerage fees, and that we must comply with international law and cannot mark your reward as a gift or as a zero-value item.\nPlease see below for more specific information on shipping to your country.\nSHIPPING IN NORTH AND SOUTH AMERICA (not including the United States) Your rewards will be fulfilled by our shipping center in the United States. You will be responsible for import duties, taxes, and brokerage fees (if applicable). There will be USPS International shipping options from which to choose when you redeem your rewards.\nSHIPPING TO THE UNITED KINGDOM AND EUROPE Your rewards will be fulfilled by our shipping center in the UK. United Kingdom backers will not pay import duties and taxes. We hope Brexit will not adversely affect the shipping of books from the UK into the EU, but due to Brexit uncertainty we cannot at this time promise that EU backers won\u2019t pay import duties, taxes, and brokerage fees. You\u2019ll choose between tracked shipping (more expensive, but with a tracking number) and untracked (more affordable, but no tracking) when redeeming your rewards.\nSHIPPING TO AUSTRALIA, NEW ZEALAND, THE SOUTH PACIFIC, AND ASIA Your rewards will be fulfilled by our shipping center in Australia. Backers in Australia will not pay import duties and taxes; other backers will be responsible for import duties, taxes, and brokerage fees (if applicable).You\u2019ll choose between tracked shipping (more expensive, but with a tracking number) and untracked (more affordable, but no tracking) when redeeming your rewards.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is the fifteenth Kickstarter campaign for Monte Cook Games.

Pledge now for all four decks. \n Update #16 - PDF news.  \nThe Dossier Deck campaign introduces a series of tools for game masters to create, customize, and populate their games with detailed system neutral NPC's. To launch this new line, SkeletonKey Games is creating three unique card decks; Merchants, Mages, Commoners, and Orcs & Goblins. Each 51-card deck is a stand-alone accessory capable of producing over 4,000 different combinations. You can combine all three decks to open up over 100,000 variations. \nNow with four decks to choose from. Better yet, choose them all!\nEach Dossier Deck contains three different card types; Appearance cards, Traits cards, and Story Hook cards. Simply shuffle each card type into its own mini-deck and draw one card of each type.\nEvery game master finds themselves in a pinch from time-to-time. It's actually part of the fun of being a game master. Dossier Decks provide a tool to help game masters springboard great roleplaying opportunities with their players. \nNeed a detailed alchemist for your players to interact with? Mix your Mages and Merchants decks and draw one out. In an instant you could have a temperamental gnome who distrusts humans and would make you a great deal if you could help him out with his rare feather collection.\nA goblin ambush makes for an great random encounter but how about an ambush lead by a stout goblin covered in boils that fears water and possesses a treasure that belongs to a far more powerful entity.\nNot a seat-of-your-pants kind of game master? Planning out a collection of unique NPCs has never been easier. Draw or select the cards for as many NPCs as you will need (and a few extras just in case) and store them in a 9-pocket card page. You can get three NPCs per sheet or six if you double side them! \n A. Appearance Card - The content of this card is perfect to share with players.\n B. NPC portrait.\n C. NPC name.\n D. A short descriptive blurb, perfect for reading aloud as a first impression to players.\n E. Traits Card - This card is focused on the character's personality and skills. It is perfect for guiding the game master in making the character unique.\n F. Trait text gives game-master-only insight into the character.\n G. A quote gives an example of something the character might say or a look at the overall way they speak.\n H. Story Hook Card - This card features inspiration for side quests, treasure, and extra drama in your story line.\n I. This text describes an item, place, or creature related to the character in some way.\n J. Art related to the content of the Story Hook card.\n K. The story hook text gives game masters a subplot that can be a springboard for adventures and side quests.\n L. Set Symbol and Card ID Number - If you decide to shuffle your sets together, you can keep track of which cards go with which set should you ever want to separate them back out.\n\n\nOnce SkeletonKey Games has produced this project, the final fulfillment will be handled by the great team over at Nord Games.\n Shipping: Estimated shipping rates are listed by region in the FAQ below.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nSkeletonKey Games has run and delivered four Kickstarter campaigns.

His callous fingers ran tenderly across the anvil, he knew this was the last time he\u2019d ever see it. The thuul closed his eyes and thought about all the marvellous armours and weapons he had crafted in his smithy, deep within Voronoy-Kefas, and sighed. Then he turned to the beautiful Murgla resting upon the anvil, his masterpiece. The Mittraka-inlaid runes gleamed in the dying light from the Logi furnace, runes he had crafted and empowered, runes holding fragments of his own memory. \nHe closed his eyes and ran his fingers for the final time across the Murgles, feeling the holy power held within the runes. \nAs he opened his eyes again, the shadows in the smithy deepened. It was on the move. The Hunter. And Argothar was the only prey left in Voronoy-Kefas... \nRunes of Memory is an official campaign for Trudvang Chronicles, which will take the player characters across the Stormlands and the Oster Sea in search of a lost dwarven kingdom, Voronoy-Kefas. \nThe Campaign\nAges ago the dwarven kingdom of Voronoy-Kefas became hit with a terrible plague of madness. As thuul Argothar T\u00e9waz was also hit by this curse, he crafted a mystic rune and bound a part of his soul in a marvelous Murgles, hoping that one day a dwarven hero would come along and be able to unlock the Murgles' secrets.\nAfter being attacked by goblins the adventurers discover the Murgles of T\u00e9waz. Seeing it has unknown runes a Thuul is needed to interpret them. At the same time the bearer of the Murgles starts to have vivid dreams of grand caverns, great furnaces and dwarven smiths at work. As the adventurers learn about the Runes of Memory, they start to get leads as to where to find Voronoy-Kefas, the lost dwarven kingdom.\nTheir mission to find the kingdom takes them far and across dangerous lands and open seas. Once they find the secret entrance, they will find that the old kingdom is the home to skeletons and an intangible demon. To reclaim the kingdom and discover what happened to the dwarves in Voronoy-Kefas, the adventurers must face the demon along with their own darkest fears and nightmares. Only the most brave and clever heroes can prevail and help restoring Voronoy-Kefas til its former glory. \nPrinted version of this book is KICKSTARTER EXCLUSIVE!\n Adventure: Curse of Runes \n Written by Max Herngren\nCover by Alvaro Tapia\nThe Thuuls etched great runes and magical wards all along the scarlet blade of the sword, for this new material was unknown to the dwarves and thus they were yet weary of it. The jewelers and artisans etched gemstones that shone like stars into its hilt and weaved its grip with the thick hide of the toughest tunnel hog in the kingdom. Forged from the boiling blood of dragons, every dwarf in Trudvang grew to fear its name. \nFor this runeblade bore a cruel destiny, and the king named it Krovabonh \u2013 \u201cIronblood.\u201d\nCurse of Runes is the tale of the characters\u2019 struggles to free themselves from an ancient curse cast upon them by primordial powers of fire and soot that dwell within a dwarven sword from the Age of Dreams. The journey will take them across Muspelheim, the home of the dwarves \u2013 deep into the heart of the fabled kingdom of Tvologoya and the molten core of Trudvang. \n\u201cYes, indeed.

In Catacombs Cubes, you take on the role of a Catacombs hero and compete to expand the small village into its full glory!\nUse wooden cubes to build unique structures, and then add them to the Village Grid. Put a tile in the right place to enable combos that can quickly turn the tide of a game.\nStrategic tile placement, efficient resource management, and timely combos will determine the victor!\nWe are excited to be releasing our first non-flicking game.

Additionally, some gameplay rules may have been altered.\n\n\nHow To Play\n Note: Only the English manual is available for download.\nThe Quarry\n   At the start of the game, the players choose whether they would like to play with dice or with tokens. The Quarry Foreman then draws or rolls the Quarry Offers, one for each player. During their turn, each player gets to pick a Quarry Offer.\nAnimated GIFs may take a moment to load.\n\n                                      Each Quarry Offer allows a player to collect Cube Pieces or perform special actions, such as contribute to the town's Palace or transform one of their existing Cube Pieces.\nAnimated GIFs may take a moment to load.\nBuilding a Tile\n  Instead of drafting from The Quarry, players have the option to Build a Structure on their turn.\nPlayers can build either their Residence Tile, or one of the available tiles in the Village Plans. To build a structure, a player must have the adequate Cube Pieces in their Construction Yard or Warehouse to physically replicate the shape of the cubes on a blueprint. \nAnimated GIFs may take a moment to load.\nOnce built, the player places the tile in the Village Grid next to an existing tile. The player earns various rewards based on the structure they completed, and based on where they placed the tile.\nAnimated GIFs may take a moment to load.\nCoins\nPlayers can earn Coins when they build a structure in the town. Coins can be spent at any time during a player's turn which allow them to perform additional actions. Otherwise, saving coins can potentially earn players some Victory Points during the end game scoring.\nAnimated GIFs may take a moment to load.\nContributing to the Palace\n   Unlike other structures, the Palace is built over the course of the game by all players. Each contribution a player makes earns them some rewards. To contribute to the Palace, a player must get the Palace Action Token or spend a Red Coin.\n  Only the player that contributes the last cube to the Palace gets to actually add the palace to the town, and reaps extra rewards.\n  Animated GIFs may take a moment to load.\n End of the Game\nOnce the Village Grid has reached its maximum size, the game ends. The maximum size is determined by the number of players, for example, a 4 player game ends at a 4x5 Village Grid. \n Players who decided to hold on to their Coins for the end of the game will get extra Victory Points for having the most of one type of Coin.\nThe player with the most Victory Points wins!\nSupport\nFor customer support and inquiries: \nPlease email: ks@elzra.com\nPlease note also that we cannot respond to specific customer support requests on the comments page of this project.

If you want to know what I am up to in the future, the url WWW.FORW.DE is always going to forward to my latest project (or to my homepage, Twitter feed, etc., if I am not currently running a project). In addition, you can follow me on Twitter @KaiHerbertz\nThis Kickstarter campaign aims to expand Albedo - a space-themed  deckbuilding game. The base game is required in order to use the expansion. Therefore, this Kickstarter campaign also offers the Albedo base game in the reward levels.  \nThis expansion retains Albedo's innovations, for example space ship cards that can be rotated  to retrofit them or the extra decision layer at each planet. Albedo's simultaneous action selection results in minimum downtime and a uniform game length. In addition the expansion includes new planet cards, a new type of card, and a new faction.\nHere are a few how to play videos about the base game as well as a short explanation with images. The expansion adds a new playing style for the new faction, but the core mechanisms remain the same. \nDRAW 2 PLANET CARDS (3 PLANET CARDS WITH 5-8 PLAYERS)\nDRAW 6 UNIT CARDS\nEVALUATE THE PLANETS\nCONFIGURE YOUR UNITS\nSECRETLY ASSIGN YOUR UNITS TO THE PLANETS WITH THE NAVIGATION CARDS\nONCE EVERYONE HAS ASSIGNED THEIR UNITS, RESOLVE THE PLANETS. FOR EXAMPLE, THE PLAYER ABOVE MIGHT FACE OTHER PLAYERS AT PLANET 1:\nPLAYER 1 HAS 7 SPACE COMBAT (ACE PILOT 3 + FIGHTER 2 + SECONDARY LAYOUT FIGHTER 1 + SECONDARY LAYOUT FIGHTER 1) WHEREAS PLAYER 2 HAS 8 SPACE COMBAT (FIGHTER 2 + FIGHTER 2 + FIGHTER 2 + SECONDARY LAYOUT FIGHTER 1 + SECONDARY LAYOUT FIGHTER 1)\nPLAYER 2 GETS THE FIRST PICK OF PLANETARY LOCATIONS.\nAFTER PLANET 2 HAS BEEN RESOLVED AS WELL, PLAY CONTINUES WITH THE NEXT ROUND AND 2 NEW PLANETS.\nTHE GAME HAS A SET LENGTH OF 7 ROUNDS, AFTER WHICH THE PLAYER WITH THE MOST POINTS WINS THE GAME.\nSean and Ronan from the Gamepit podcast produced one of their Pit Stop videos to concisely explain how Albedo works:  \nToucan Play that Game also produced a How to Play video about Albedo: \nThe expansion consists of a box, a rule book, and 100 cards: the new faction takes up 56 of those cards. There are also 16 planet cards and 20 \"secret\" cards (see explanation below). That leaves 8 cards, which are going to be used for additional copies of the Aerospace Fighter unit from the base game.\nAs a new catch up mechanism, whoever has the least amount of victory points at the end of rounds 2-6 is dealt a secret card. If players are tied for the lowest victory point total, then each of the tieing players receives a secret card. \nThere are 5 different secrets, which are duplicated thrice for a total of 20 cards. Each secret is worth 1 victory point. Instead of taking a victory point a secret can be played for its card effect. Here is a selection of three of the five cards. However, their layout and wording might change slightly. \nPraise for the Albedo base game and the Albedo Space Pirates! expansion: \nFellow game designer Robert Seater, who triggered the idea for the Yggdrasil alien species with his forum question \"Can I play as a fungal or plant-like alien race?\", has this to say about Albedo and its first expansion on BoardGameGeek: \n\nHere is a blurb (click the image to see their review) by Fiona and Amy from the Game Shelf about the Albedo base game: \nThe Cardboard Cultist made a timelapse video about Albedo: \nHerbert and Philipp of the \"Nerds-gegen-Stephan.de... caught in play, der nerdige Trashtalk\" podcast talked about Albedo in one of their earlier episodes (in German). \n Elea and Philipp of the \"Nerdige and niveauvolle Trashtalk\" talked about Albedo in their latest episode, which was recorded on the 6th of July 2019 (in German). You can find the relevant section at the 8 minute 45 seconds mark.\nHolger Christiansen of the Teilzeithelden also reviewed the Albedo base game.

He only had the  first edition available, but apart from cosmetics the first and second  edition are functionally the same: \nLast, but not least, I was a guest on the We're not Wizards podcast and talked about the Albedo Yggdrasil campaign.\n BoardGamePrices.com gave a shout out to Albedo Yggdrasil in their News & Features section!\nIf the base level funding goal is exceeded, additional promo items are added for free as stretch goals to the reward tiers that contain the expansion.\nPromo items may appear at different occasions (for example at a trade show), but Kickstarter backers have early access to these promotional items.\nOnce a stretch goal is reached, the next stretch goal is going to be revealed.\nIf you are a retailer and are interested in Albedo, please get in touch  via e-mail (info at hespiele dot de) to discuss specifics.  \nAs with all Kickstarter campaigns that have physical rewards, one of  the highest costs is shipping, which is about \u20ac9,- for most countries. \nIn  order to reduce the cost for backers, I am going to subsidize the  shipping cost and cover a portion of the shipping cost myself.  Therefore, there is a flat shipping cost fee of \u20ac5,- for everyone instead of different shipping costs for different regions. \nSince the game is produced in Europe, distribution within the European Union is not going to incur additional duties. \nPlease be aware that there might be duties in your country (USA, Canada, Australia, etc.) if you are not residing within the European Union. \nThe EU-friendly shipping image was downloaded (with implicit permission as per their blog post) from Stonemaier Games. \nAlbedo on Boardgamegeek \nHESpiele Website \nImprint \nData Protection / Privacy \nHESpiele on Twitter \nKai Herbertz on Twitter ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWith the experience of previous Kickstarter campaigns and two completed board games (\"Das Katastrophenspiel\" and \"Albedo\") I do not expect any unsolvable difficulties.

We will collect this via our pledge manager after the campaign ends, using PayPal. This is so we can be fair to all our backers as shipping is rarely one size fits all, and also give you more stretch goodies and possibly a choice of carrier options.\nWe will ship your rewards at our cost to our international hubs. Depending on where in the world you are, we will either ship to you from our hub in the UK (EU backers), China (Asia Pacific backers), Singapore (Singaporean backers), Canada (Canadian backers), Australia (Australia and New Zealand backers) or Atlanta (USA and the rest of the world). Following is a list of rough estimates for shipping a basic pledge. Keep in mind these are just estimates and that accurate costs will be calculated in the pledge manager system according to your address. Also keep in mind that costs will likely rise based on optional buys you choose.\n*** For backers in China, please read THIS UPDATE.\nUnfortunately, different import laws and customs have made it impossible for CMON to ship games to certain specific countries.\nWE DO NOT SHIP TO: Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Afghanistan. \nPlease note that while we do our best to get you your rewards in a timely manner, you may not necessarily receive your rewards before the product makes it into distribution in your own country or before it's made available at conventions and special promotion opportunities. We hope that the special price and exclusive items you will get during the Kickstarter will make up for any such possible lag. However, if this is something that is not acceptable to you, please do not back this project, and instead wait for the retail release. Thank you for your understanding. \nBe aware that any pledges that are confirmed after the pledge manager deadline is considered a \"Late Confirm\" and will be shipped from the USA hub at a later date. For non-US backers, that will likely incur increased shipping costs. Also, note that Late Confirms will not be able to customize the contents of their pledge. They will be offered a single pledge, including most, if not all, Kickstarter Exclusive Optional Buys. We also cannot ship to PO Boxes domestically or internationally. Due to the size of each package there is too great a risk of the package being bounced back to us.\nThe table below gives you a general idea of the full schedule of what to expect once the campaign ends.

Also, due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others.\n\nWe've done our best to minimize this as much as possible, and we are always happy to refund pledges if for some totally unforeseen reason the game can't be delivered at all.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nWe can refund you within 14 days of the campaign\u2019s end, fees included. After that, we have a policy of no questions asked, though that\u2019s minus Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we can\u2019t get back from them after 14 days). However, if we\u2019ve begun packaging your pledge for shipment, no refunds are possible. If a component cannot be delivered AT ALL, we refund that completely, including fees.\n\nAll refunds after the 14 days close of the campaign may be processed via PayPal or reversed via Stripe to your credit card at our discretion.

However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your pledge if you contact us and confirm your pledge after the 8 week window has elapsed. Unconfirmed pledges make it difficult for us to plan production and logistics, and in the past have led to project delays. For this project we do not intend to allow this to happen, which may mean if you confirm your pledge too late, exclusive items may not be produced in sufficient quantity for your pledge.\n\nIf you confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods.

Our first 2 books touched briefly on the character design process, but this new book is a really deep dive into the art. Character design is such a vast field, which is why it needs it's own focused, indepth book. \nWe're working with an amazing line up of incredible industry PROFESSIONALS, and the book is jam-packed full of their combined experience, gained over their long careers. \nDesign Example - Unofficial Cover\nDesign Example - \"Character Archetypes\" Chapter\n The Goal! \nOur goal is to help YOU be a better artist and have fun at the same time! We want to provide you,  both hobbyists and pros, with a better understanding of the WHOLE character design process. Most importantly, the book gives you the tools you need to produce unique and memorable characters. \nThe techniques and tutorials included in the book help build your confidence and strengthen your knowledge of the art of character design, enabling you to successfully design for any project, and most importantly, in any style. And that's why we have such a wide array of artists with varying styles contributing to book! \nThis is a book that we have dreamed of making for a long time and it is our biggest project to date.

Most evident is our new, easier-to-use format. The original Traveller, many years ago, was three Little Black Books (LBBs) - 48-page black-covered booklets with the titles Characters and Combat, Starships, and Worlds and Adventures. We're formatting this edition as three Big Black Books (BBBs) with the same titles, but 280 pages (Book 1) or more (304 pages for Book 2 and Book 3), and all in a slip case.  \nThe T5 Core Rules Set\nWe have been working on this project constantly since 2015. Oh, there were breaks along the way. After the last printing, I was inspired to write the Traveller novel: Agent of the Imperium; somewhere in there, I had a quadruple bypass (I'm recovered, thank you). But we've been playing Traveller5 and working through its rules and concepts.\nThe Three Core Rules Books\nNow is the time for a reprint. \nAdventuring In The Traveller5 Universe. The Traveller5 Core Rules are a foundation, and  they support all sorts of adventuring within the rich Traveller universe. To help get everyone started, we have created a set of five Traveller EPIC Adventures: \"The Voyages of the Free Trader Insert-Name-Here.\" This 32-page PDF follows the exploits of any Free Trader as it wanders through Regina subsector in the Spinward Marches. We'll release it at the same time the physical books ship (that is, in August). \nAdventuring In Regina Subsector: our introductory EPIC adventures\nCards. If you have ordered anything from us in the past few years, you have probably gotten a few cards stuck in your order. We find these are great pieces to use in adventuring. So we have created the Traveller5 Benefits Deck - 54 Poker Cards in a box (subject to some last minute changes): \n12 ships (Beowulf, Scout, Yacht, and more) for use as mustering out benefits, as encounters, or as goals for adventure.\n12 worlds (Regina, Capital, Rhylanor, and more) for use as homeworlds, interesting places, or as destinations.\n12 weapons (StapleGun, Magnum, Advanced Combat Rifle, and more) for use as mustering out benefits, or available in the local weapons shop.\n 6 arcane tasks (Drive Tuning, Knack for Astrogation, and more) for acquisition in the course of adventures.\n 6 medals (Starburst for Extreme Heroism, Exemplary Service, and more) for use as mustering out benefits, or as adventure hooks.\n 6 random items for use in adventures. \nJust a sampling; subject to change.\nThe Captain's Supplement (with the Ship captain Level) provides still more items.\nAdd-Ons.We also have three add-ons (they are included at the Owner-Aboard level) that enhance the Traveller system: Deck Plans, the Traveller Novel, and the Traveller Audiobook.\nThe Deck Plans were originally issued with the Big Black Book. This edition describes them in detail based on the Ship Design System, and we find they are a great resource for adventures. \nAdd the Deck Plans to your Pledge for $20.\nThe Traveller Novel - Agent of the Imperiumgives insights into the history of the Imperium. If you missed it, this is your chance to get reading copy, and the Audiobook (on two CDs; about 10 hours of audio). By the way, the Audiobook disks include the novel eBook, AND a footnoted PDF: 300 footnotes explaining and detailing what's going on in the story. \nAdd the Paperback to your pledge for $14.\nAdd the Audiobook to your pledge for $14.\nOr, add both to your pledge for $22.\nAdd Ons\nFinally, each level has one or more Crew ID Cards: Traders' Guild Member Cards with a pre-generated, named character corresponding to the Backer Level (and all the lower level cards as well). At the First Officer (and above) Level, we'll edit the name of the character to a name you specify (within reason).\nAside. This is intended to make you support at a higher level: to bump your pledge up so you'll get more of the cards. But I just can't do it.

Photo by Kyle George.\nA Tribute to the Creative Forces of Trout Grass \nThe film's production lasted nearly three years and spanned two countries, including locations in China, Seattle, Montana, Wyoming, Florida, and Arizona. Andy Royer and Ed George were there, guiding the operations, every dynamic step of the way.\nRecently, these two energetic creators of Trout Grass passed on to the spirit world. Producer, co-writer, and bamboo extraordinaire Andy parted from two daughters and a wife when he died in 2015 after a years-long battle with cancer. Director and cinematographer Ed left unexpectedly in 2016 following a heart attack. Ed\u2019s first gig in filmmaking was as an assistant on the legendary Woodstock documentary, shot 50 years ago this summer!\nTrout Grass is an important part of Ed and Andy's dynamic body of work, and it must continue to be available and discoverable for audiences. Trout Grass: The Revival Edition is a tribute to the two innovators.   \nCinematographer Ed George enjoying a day's work in Montana. Photo from ThisIsBozeman.com\n\"A Beautifully Crafted Film.\" \nTrout Grass: The Revival Edition. A legendary rod maker treks to the source of his inspiration. A craftsman halfway around the planet encounters \"spirits of the bamboo world.\" A writer-angler contemplates the power of our connection to rivers. And diverse audiences discover what it takes to convert a piece of grass into a six-sided baton ready to conduct an orchestra of trout and water. \nThe documentary Trout Grass unveils the joys of international camaraderie, fine craftsmanship, and majestic rivers as it tracks the 10,000-mile passage of bamboo around the world. From a lush forest in remote China, to a rustic workshop in Montana, this film traces the transition of bamboo from a living plant to a finished fly rod. \nTrout Grass has always been an international journey into the passion of fly fishing, but it is also a captivating window into the life force of rivers and the intricate bonds of sustainable craftsmanship.\nThe film appeals not only to fly fishers and bamboo enthusiasts, but also fans with interests in cultural heritage, meaningful work, and the beauty of our Earth's people and places. \nEd George and split-cane aficionado Hoagy B. Carmichael getting the shot. Photo by Kyle George.\nWords and Images Built to Last\nTrout Grass achieved great success upon its release in 2005. The film was featured at a dozen festivals throughout North America and Europe, including the Telluride Mountain Film Festival, and Bend Film in Oregon. The producers were awarded \"Best of Festival\" and \"Audience Choice\" at several screenings. About 5,000 DVDs sold in North America during the first few years of release. The documentary aired on Public Broadcast Service affiliates throughout the western United States. \nBut, hey, as Louis Carlozo of the Chicago Tribune noted, \"If it sounds like the stuff of a public-TV yawner, guess again: [David James] Duncan wastes nary a word as he tackles his subject with a poet's passion and reporter's zeal.\"\nThe film never grows old. Its pace is as soothing as the flow of mountain streams. And like the meticulously crafted split cane fly rods on display in the film, the writing, cinematography, and music are each created by masters of their art. \nReap Your Rewards\u2014Exclusive Posters, DVDs, Downloads, or a Custom Fly Rod\nDepending on your inclinations, the most exciting benefit from your Trout Grass: The Revival Edition pledge might be the custom bamboo fly rod from Sweetgrass Rods of Montana.

Your goal is to develop a self-sustaining colony independent of any terrestrial organization. This will require understanding the importance of water, air, power, and food \u2014 the necessities for survival.\nDo you dare take part in humankind\u2019s biggest challenge?\nRovers, Robots and Ships\nOn Mars is played over several rounds, each consisting of two phases - the Colonization Phase and the Shuttle Phase. \nDuring the Colonization Phase, each player takes a turn during which they take actions. The available actions depend on the side of the board they are on. If you are in orbit, you can take blueprints, buy and develop technologies, and take supplies from the Warehouse. If you are on the surface of the planet, you can construct buildings with your bots, upgrade these buildings using blueprints, take scientists and new contracts, welcome new ships, and explore the planet\u2019s surface with their rover.  \nIn the Shuttle Phase, players may travel between the colony and the Space Station in orbit. \nAll buildings on Mars have a dependency on each other and some are required for the colony to grow. Building shelters for Colonists to live in requires oxygen; generating oxygen requires plants; growing plants requires water; extracting water from ice requires power; generating power requires mining minerals; and mining minerals requires Colonists.  \nUpgrading the colony\u2019s ability to provide each of these resources is vital. As the colony grows, more shelters are needed so that the Colonists can survive the inhospitable conditions on Mars. \nDuring the game, players are also trying to complete missions. Once a total of three missions have been completed, the game ends. \nTo win the game, players must contribute to the development of the first colony on Mars. This is represented during the game by players gaining Opportunity Points (OP). The player with the most OP at the end of the game is declared the winner. \nNOTE: Contents shown on this page are for visual representation only.

We established our makeshift colony on Charon and explored the region. We discovered the Royal Martian Federation (RMF), the Hielo and the Myst, and made contact. Although historical rivals, we worked together to survive the frigid conditions, stockpiling resources and launching probes across the Milky Way.\nOne probe returned compelling data from the Copernicus System in Quadrant 1. Coper has a yellow dwarf star and an intriguing group of planets. A dazzling radioactive element, that we named Vertium, was discovered. Our physicists think it could heat our colonies, and upgrade weapons and armour. As word spread, the rebel groups bolted for Coper. The fragile cooperation evaporated. Each faction is now out for itself - claiming planets and mining Vertium. The stakes are clear: for whoever controls the Vertium will control Coper, and perhaps the galaxy. Brooks out.\nVertium is a quick and tactical space colonization game for 1 to 4 players. Players are faction Commanders directing their Captains to claim planets and mine the powerful radioactive element Vertium.\nAs influential moons orbit the colonized planets, additional Vertium is gained.

Numbering now in the trillions, they are a polyglot, cosmopolitan people, organized under a central hegemon: Union. The galaxy is vast before them, and humanity is its mirror. For some, it is a golden age of post-scarcity utopia. For the rest, that golden age remains a dream to be attained. \nInto this roiling galaxy you take your role as a mech pilot \u2014  from cold-blooded mercenaries to honor-bound Baronic cuirassiers, hardscrabble Union regulars to professional Constellar Midnights, Far Field teams at the uncanny edge of known space to the ever-wandering Albatross. Operating with a wealth of licenses from one of the galaxy\u2019s Big Five fabricators, you and your friends play a tight-knit squad of pilots on campaign \u2014 comrades together in a galaxy of danger and hope. Will you fight for Union, working to rectify the crimes of previous administrations? Will you run contracts for a corpro-state, working to advance private interests while lining your pockets? Will you fight to liberate your people from all masters, human or otherwise? Or will you fight only for yourself? \nLancer features a mix of military science fiction and mythic science fantasy. In the setting, conscript pilots mix ranks with flying aces, mercenary guns-for-hire brawl with secretive corpostate agents, and relativistic paladins cross thermal lances with causality-breaking entities. \nIn Lancer, there is promise in the potential, but the hard-won gains of humanity are under serious threat. From the internal: ruthless corpro-states, bitter anthrochauvinist reactionaries, and ponderous oligarchs, to the external: MONIST 1, or RA, an anoriginary being with unfathomable power and unknowable goals; the Aunic Ascendancy, the unbroken heirs of Old Humanity; and more. \nHaving only begun the project of recovering from its own internal political revolutions, Union now scrambles to reassert its control over a galaxy that would fall to chaos otherwise.\nWho will you fight for, pilot? \nLancers relaxing between deployment\nWhat is Lancer?\nLancer is a tabletop roleplaying game that prioritizes four pillars of play: \nRules-light, fluid, narrative play while outside of the mech.  \nTactical mech combat that promotes creative tactics, teamwork and explosive moments of action.\nModular, progression-based mech customization where narrative, setting, and character is imbued in the gear, systems, and equipment your character chooses. \nA play loop that encourages narrative advancement. \nLancer offers deep, modular mech customization, a wide range of player backgrounds to prompt storytelling, and a system and setting with room for any narrative you and your group want to tell. It\u2019s best with a group of 3-5 players, and can be used to run a one-shot session or persistent campaign. \nLancer draws thematic inspiration from various media: The lived-in, cosmopolitan, working class CRT retrofuture of Aliens, Blade Runner, 2001: A Space Odyssey, Akira, and Cowboy Bebop; the science fantasy of Dan Simmons\u2019 Hyperion Cantos, Bungie\u2019s Destiny, Ursula LeGuin\u2019s The Left Hand of Darkness, Moebius\u2019s The World of Edena and Arzach, and Anne Leckie's Imperial Radch trilogy; the soldiers-on-campaign tension of The Thin Red Line, Band of Brothers, and Platoon; and the subjectivity-fraying uncanny of Tarkovsky's Stalker, Cronenberg\u2019s Videodrome, and Evangelion\u2019s Angels. \nMechanically, aspects of Lancer\u2019s play owe particular thanks to existing media for inspiration: Schwalb Entertainment\u2019s Shadow of The Demon Lord for its Accuracy/Difficulty system; the Armored Core series for its modular mech customization; and to John Harper\u2019s Blades In The Dark for its downtime systems.  \nWhile we have a significant number of finished art and lore in the book already, we imagine the final product to be part setting book, part ruleset, and part art book \u2014 a rich resource for not only roleplaying tools, but narrative-inspiring art and worldbuilding. \nBruja introducing her Gorgon\nWhat Does Lancer Do Differently?\nThere are clear, differentiated rules for narrative play and tactical combat.\nNarrative play and tactical combat demand different rule sets and scales of play. Whether you want the game to move at a fluid, narrative pace in order to zoom in or expand your story, or jump right into tactical mech combat, Lancer establishes clear guidelines for when and how to implement differing styles. \nLancer offers systemized downtime and brings narrative-enhancing structure to the play session.\nLancer has a clear play structure making it easy for game masters of any experience to run a dynamic campaign. Players can take downtime actions with defined outcomes to progress story beats, work on projects, or get access to resources. What they do during downtime impacts how their missions begin, progress, and end. This structure prompts clear goals, stakes, and personal involvement from the characters that will help your table to bring storytelling, role-playing, and consequence to every game.\nLancer\u2019s character system is classless, modular, and encourages deep customization.\nWhen you progress in Lancer, your pilot permanently gains licenses that grant them access to parts and gear from a mech of their choice. Unlike other games, however, you are not locked in to a set character path - instead you will create your own personalized mech. Your pilot can mix and match any parts you like, creating a system where players define their own roles by the choices they make. Build broad or deep \u2014 your pilot is your pilot, and your mech is your mech. \nFlavor, characterization, and setting drive every aspect of Lancer \nNearly every gear option has lore attached to it, further defining the history and tone of the setting as well as acting as hooks for deeper player characterization. When you take licenses from the IPS-Northstar Raleigh, the gunslinging mech with the MJOLNIR chest cannon, you know exactly what you're getting.\nOda and his IP-N Raleigh, deep desert\nYou can already play the pre-release version of LANCER here (the link or clicking on the title above will take you to our itch.io page where you can download the game) and download a fully working version of our companion app, COMP/CON, here. This is the full game, totally free and currently being played by dozens of groups, but without a lot of the art, layout, and editing that's the goal of this kickstarter. Even after release, we will always have a free version of LANCER available on all platforms.\nAfter nearly two years of development, play testing, and community building, we wanted to take the next step and finish Lancer\u2019s first edition core book in proper form: hardback, with full color, professional editing and layout, and packed with art by some of the best illustrators working in comics and concept design today. \nClick through for a larger size\nLancer is a large project. Roughly 560 pages of finished text \u2014 rules, setting information, lore, generators, NPCs, and many more tools for Game Masters \u2014 almost 20 artists, and millions of possible gear combinations. We\u2019re asking for a fair amount to fund this project, but we think it\u2019s just that \u2014  a fair ask. \nClick through for a closer look at the MkII Sherman\nOne of the things we want to make clear is that we don\u2019t want to keep anyone from playing Lancer. Despite the campaign to raise funds necessary to create a final product, we mean to keep a version of Lancer free \u2014 always. We've gone almost two years in public development of this game and intend to keep the game available for the community to play and enjoy.\nLancer is the second TTRPG from Tom Parkinson Morgan, creator of Kill Six Billion Demons and Broken Worlds, and Miguel Lopez, a fiction writer based out of Portland, Oregon.\nMassif Press is a new publisher made up of Tom Parkinson Morgan and Miguel Lopez.

Here's the breakdown:\n 300 Backers: Iconic Mech Wallpapers (for desktop and phone) - ACHIEVED! \n 400 Backers: Logo Wallpapers (for desktop and phone) - ACHIEVED! \n 500 Backers: Company Catalog Wallpapers  - ACHIEVED! \n 1000+ Backers: Access to CLOCKMAKER'S BARDO, a sealed Union Intelligence Bureau report. -  ACHIEVED! \n CLOCKMAKER'S BARDO Report unlocked.

Expect a Twine game to be delivered no later than the physical copy's launch date. \nClick through for the social stretch goals\nAs we gain in backers, we will release the art and details for the four Long Rim mechs above, so stay posted!\nWe amazingly blew through our first stretch goals in the first 6 hours of this campaign. This means all backers at the PDF tier and up will receive digital copies of No Room for a Wallflower, Lancer's first official campaign module, and three Field Guides, setting and lore guides for the various areas of the Lancer canon. Delivery for these digital-only rewards will be some time in 2020.\nSince we're predicting our physical book will be ready to ship no later than March 2020, and shipping quotes are only good for a brief window (comparatively speaking) we're going to hold off on charging shipping fees right away; we don't want to under charge now and then have to charge you again when it comes time to fulfill your pledges!\nAs soon as we're ready to ship, we'll send out a notice via BackerKit \u2014 that way we can ensure you'll have the best possible price on shipping. So, for right now, you don't have to add anything to your pledge beyond the stated pledge level! \nIn the meantime, here's an idea of what we're projecting for shipping costs (subject to change, of course, all prices in USD):\nDomestic shipping (US) will run a flat $12.00.\nCanada, UK, EU, Australia, China, Hong Kong, and Japan is a flat $25.00 USD.\nShipping to New Zealand is $27.00 USD\nShipping to Switzerland and Norway is $45.00 USD. \nAnd shipping to the rest of the world is $51.00 USD.\nNote that these are all subject to change. If you're snagging a physical book, be on the lookout for further communications via BackerKit. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe know backing TTRPG campaigns from new developers can be a risk, but we want to assure you that Lancer is a safe bet. While this is Massif Press' first campaign, we are confident in our timeline and our product. \n\nHere's why:\n\nThe text for the Core Book is done save for a final copyedit and layout, has been available in progressive editions for free since July 2017, and has a robust play and homebrew community. If you're new to Lancer or on the fence about backing, you can check out the full game for free, request a PDF of an older edition, or come chat with the dev team and homebrew/fan community on the Discord. We're passionate about this project, and intend to use the funds raised by this campaign to pay our layout artist, editor, and general artists to polish this book with the finish we feel it -- and its fans -- deserve. \n\nSo, to that end, here are the risks we face: \n\nDeadlines. As soon as the campaign wraps and we can pay our team, they'll get working on art, editing, and layout. As long as they stick on deadline, we'll meet our final PDF fulfillment date. We don't anticipate any delays as long as we are able to get deliveries from our art team on time.\n\nPrinting. Once our final PDF is sorted out, we'll be working with our printer to get the first run of books on time. As soon as the final product is proofed and the first run is printed, we'll get physical copies sent to the backers that pledged for them. Time and shipping are the risks here -- we'll be communicative and up front with all backers who come in at this level, and expect physical fulfillment no later than March 2020. In the meantime, you'll always have access to the free PDF, and the Premium PDF as soon as it's finished.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 2 or more", "title": "Ominet Access", "descp": ">//ACCESS is TRUE and PERSISTENT\nWant to follow along with development?

We will be trawling through the Journals of yesteryear, selecting the best articles, revising/re-writing them for the latest edition of the game, and adding a whole host of never-before-seen material. This will (initially) be compiled into three volumes which, for Kickstarter backers only, will arrive within their own deluxe slipcase.\nWe will also be drawing from the better fanzines of the era (having tracked down the original authors) to create the essential resource for exploring Charted Space!\nThe Journal of the Travellers' Aid Society (JTAS) will be starting at three 128 page volumes, but stretch goals will unlock additional volumes at no extra cost to backers - we will simply extend the slipcase in size and add the additional books!\n\nWhat is Inside?\nMuch of the work on the first three volumes has already been completed, and you can download part of Volume One right HERE, so you can see the style we are going for with these books. This is a work in progress, and you will see it updated to completion over the course of the Kickstarter project.\nEach is a treasure trove of information and game additions, including adventures, new ships, animals from across Charted Space, philosophical musings on the big empires, histories, different takes on familiar equipment and vehicles, brand new vehicles, characters to be met in starports, playable alien races, and much, much more...\nThis is what we currently have planned for Volume One (subject to tweaks and ever better ideas as we continue to work on the Journals):\n The Ship in the Lake: Uncover a sunken vessel lying in a potential hotspot to uncover a small fortune\n Bestiary: Poke and provoke the Bush Runner, Tree Kraken, Lozin, Luugiir, Tree Lion, Seedspitter and Miniphant\n SOHO Light Freighter: A heavily armed trader suitable for the worst areas of the Reach - with High Guard rules for Laser Barbettes\n SuSAG: The run down on one of the largest megacorporations in Charted Space\n The ATV: A look at the familiar ATV, with variants both large and small, grav-assisted and aquatic\n A Concise History of the Vilani: Explore how the Vilani rose to prominence\n Burst Lasers: For when you just cannot decide between pulse and beam\n The Dynchia & Girug'kagh: Two fully playable minor alien races\n Remote Piloted Reconnaissance Unit: A perfect device for Travellers who want to see what they will be facing before leaping in with both feet\n Embassy in Arms: Stage an evacuation of an embassy under fire in this adventure\n Within the Two Thousand Worlds: Understand the K'kree before they appear in your campaigns later this year\n Piracy on the Spinward Main: How best to make Credits from 'freelance' trade?\n Vargr Corsairs: And then see how the masters do it\n Assault Rocket Launcher: A brand new weapon with ammunition to resolve any situation\n Simone Garibaldi: A scholar to be met at any starport - but is her latest discovery real?\n Emperors of the Third Imperium: Just who is in charge, and how did they get there?\n Light Patrol Vehicle & APC: Found at many starports, these light vehicles are suitable for policing and light military use alike\nVolumes Two and Three have oodles more articles, including more aliens and animals, more adventures and characters, explorations of Imperial and Zhodani military forces, a revision of the original Exotic Atmospheres Special Supplement, vehicles of the IISS, and much, much more - we will be showcasing the contents of each volume during the Kickstarter process and courting your opinion on the articles!\nThe new Journals of the Travellers' Aid Society come in a 8.5\" x 5.5\" format (a bit bigger than the old 'little black books'), making them easy to have at hand at the gaming table to flip to the articles you are after.\n\nWhy Kickstarter?\nWell, we enjoy talking about Traveller to Traveller fans which, for us, is enough to get everyone involved in the first place.\nHowever, the greater truth is that we are sitting on tons and tons of Traveller source material... and these Journals are the perfect vehicle to get it to you. \nDoing this project via Kickstarter will not only allow us to gauge your opinions and reactions as to the actual contents of the Journals and which articles should be selected for inclusion, but we can link your backing directly to the amount of content - in effect, the more popular this project becomes, the more volumes we will be able to put into the slipcase.\nWe will be starting with three volumes and have already started compiling articles for a fourth. How many more will follow will be up to all of you!\n\nPledge Levels\nThere are just three main pledge levels in this Kickstarter project - select the one that appeals to you the most and we will soon have the Journals in your hands.\nA huge (28\"x 40\") full colour poster map showcasing the major powers of Charted Space and their position in the galaxy\nSix Traveller pencils, perfect for your players\nOne Traveller pen, because referees are worth it\nThe Ship Recognition Pack, 25 postcard-sized aids picturing and detailing the most common ships of Charted Space\nA boxed set of 20 brand new Traveller dice\nA Character Sheet pad, ready for your Travellers to record their most personal details...\n\nStretch Goals\nThere is a Tigress Dreadnought's worth of Traveller material we could fill many JTAS volumes with - and that is exactly what we will be doing through stretch goals!\nIf we reach these intergalactic heights, we will add to the TAS Welcome Pack - High Passage backers will gain a paperback 'novel' containing a set of Traveller short stories. These will also be received as ebooks (PDF, ebook, and mobi formats), and High Passage backers will be the very first to read the first instalments of a new range of Traveller fiction coming later this year...\n\nTraveller Packages\nDuring past Traveller Kickstarter projects, we offered various existing Traveller books so backers could fill in the gaps of their collections. The Traveller range is starting to grow quite nicely, and so we have put together a range of Traveller Packages that will allow you to add to your pledge and get these books as soon as the Kickstarter is complete (no waiting around for the Journals to be printed!).\nSimply choose which packages you are after and add their cost to your current pledge level. After the Kickstarter is complete, you will receive a survey asking you to confirm which packages you added, and we will send you these books within the next four weeks, along with their PDFs!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have always delivered on our Kickstarter projects and if you were to ask one of our previous backers of previous Traveller projects such as The Great Rift or the Element Class Cruiser Blueprints, we believe you would hear that the quality of our Kickstarter projects is always worth it, and you tend to end up with more than you originally pledged for!\n\nThat said, we have taken steps to ensure the Journal of the Travellers Aid Society does not over run its projected completion date.\n\nFor a start, much of the work has already been done on the first three volumes, and volume one has already entered the art and layout process - you can freely download what has been completed for free using the link above.\n\nSecond, we have brought in several Traveller-writers, including fan favourite Martin J Dougherty, to pen the brand new material for these Journals, thus spreading the load. Traveller veterans will know the reputation of Mr Dougherty well, as he is a true professional and one of the most reliable writers Mongoose has ever worked with in our near-18 years of business - backers of the Great Rift and Element Cruisers Kickstarter projects saw that he delivered manuscripts on time, and they were most excellent!\n\nWe will be showcasing previews of the Journals throughout this Kickstarter to demonstrate just what we are working on, how we are progressing, and to gauge your opinion on the articles.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a31 or more", "title": "Traveller", "descp": "You get the heartfelt thanks of the Travellers Aid Society, and a warm welcome in every starport you visit!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Apr 2019"}], "stat": ["14 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a330 or more", "title": "Virtual TAS Member", "descp": "You will receive the PDF edition of The Journal of the Travellers Aid Society, with all volumes and all stretch goals that are unlocked in PDF format!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2019"}], "stat": ["146 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a350 or more", "title": "TAS Member", "descp": "You will receive the slipcase edition of The Journal of the Travellers Aid Society, with all volumes and all stretch goals that are unlocked, along with the PDF editions as soon as they are complete.

Click here for information \nHow does a book of war game rules written in 1880 lead directly to the creation of Dungeons & Dragons nearly a hundred years later?\nSecrets of Blackmoor is the two-hour documentary film resulting from an unprecedented exploration into the evolution of Role Playing Games (RPG's) that reveals the true origin of Dungeons & Dragons.\nIt's the story of the invention of Role Playing Games as told by the people who were there: the Twin Cities Gamers. \nIf you think D&D is the beginning of the story, then think again: D&D is actually the end of the beginning.\nA pair of extremely valuable copies of Original Dungeons & Dragons (commonly known as OD&D)\nIn 1974, Dungeons & Dragons is the first Role Playing Game ever published.  It also becomes a worldwide phenomenon that brings fame and fortune to its creators: Gary Gygax and David L. Arneson.\nPlayed by millions, and now a multi-billion dollar industry, D&D has influenced the likes of Stephen Colbert, George RR Martin, Robin Williams, and countless others.\nIt is the foundation of much of today's pop culture: Game of Thrones, World of Warcraft, Magic the Gathering, and more.\nYet, Dave and Gary's fame, and the ensuing legends & myths, have eclipsed the actual history of the game.\nIs this the oldest Character Sheet ever found? It is!\nSecrets of Blackmoor takes you to the very beginning, and reveals what actually led to D&D.  The film debunks the tired old mythology by showing you the very roots of the RPG's creation and all the relevant facts:  the who, how, and why of the game's origin.\nBe one of the first to know the Secrets of Blackmoor -- Coming March, 2019.\nA Napoleonic miniatures battle being played, 1966. Is this the beginning of Role Playing? It is!\nWe are done editing the movie, but it needs a little more work before it can be released.  All of our time is now consumed by what can best be described as adding a fine finish to an already wonderful movie.  We're really down to adding the last touches -- things like color and sound refinements. \nWe feel strongly that Secrets of Blackmoor is the seminal documentary on the history of Dungeons & Dragons. Yet we need you to support us in this last stage of post production.\nPlease take a minute to look over our videos, and gifts (located in the side bar).  There's even a special reward level to be delivered this Christmas day.\nGet out your dice and roll for initiative, become part of our Secret Team by pledging your support!\nMore about the film follows.\nIn 1963, a bunch of high schoolers and college students form a military history club in the Twin Cities area of Minnesota.\nHiding within this club is a group of war gamers, who find an old military training manual from the 1880's in the library of the University of Minnesota. On the cover is  a curious title,   Strategos - the American Game of War, and it is written by a man with an equally curious name, Charles Adiel Lewis Totten. \nIs this the book that inspires the Twin Cities gamers to invent the RPG? It is!\nWithin the dense pages of this old book are a few sentences that inspire these young gamers.  The influence of Strategos quickly changes how they play their war games.  But are they really following these old rules, or have they stumbled onto something truly unique by re-interpreting what they say?\nShould a game be constrained by rules and a board, like Monopoly, or should there be no boundaries at all? \nIs this one of the oldest Dungeons in existence? It is!\nThese young gamers have no idea that they will devote the next 10 years of their lives as the incubator that develops the ideas and methods for an entirely new type of game, and that they will change the face of their hobby forever.\nOne thing is very clear--something magical is going on in the Twin Cities.\nMost people no longer know the names of the gamers who came before D&D, or the crazy ideas they came up with that made D&D possible.  Without people's names to attach to ideas, the real history of how RPG's come into existence gets lost. \nWho is David Wesely?\nWho is Duane Jenkins?\nWho is Peter Gaylord?\nWho is Ross Maker?\nWho is Helen Nicholson?\nDave Arneson's own miniatures on his map of the Comeback Inn\nAs you dig deeper into the past, you begin to ask even more questions.  Who created the archetype of the first Wizard, Thief, or Paladin in one of these games?  Who was the First Woman to ever play in an RPG?  Where did the concept of the dungeon adventure come from?  Who was the first \u201cDungeon Master,\u201d or referee?\nAnd the number one question: who invented Role Playing?\nWe've been asking ourselves these kinds of questions since we began playing RPG's back in the 70's.\nThose who helped create RPG's are nearly forgotten.  Many of them have passed away unsung.  Yet clues to their lives can be found in cardboard boxes hidden in attics and basements.   Old papers, and worn lead ships and soldiers, tell stories of hard fought battles and dirty political maneuvering.\nIs this a secret message passed between players during the very first RPG in 1968? ... It is!\nMost important is the revelation of the ideas behind all of the games they create.  That with each iteration of their games and ideas, these young gamers in the Twin Cities are pushing the envelope on how a game should be played.  That there isn't just one RPG, or one inventor, but many. \nThey begin to develop a new play style, The Role Play Method, and they apply this method to nearly every game they get their hands on, thus creating a series of RPG's.\nThe evidence for these games can be found in the relics.  We have worked to discover and preserve many astounding game documents, like the first character sheet, or hand-written correspondence in a game between mighty rulers in the time of Napoleon.  There are even maps of worlds, cities, and foreboding dungeons.\nIs this the earliest town map made for an RPG? It is!\nOften the meaning of the relics isn't obvious, but video interviews with the people who used these objects gives them context.   We have sought to record as many interviews as possible, thus preserving what is left of the oral history of the Original Role Playing Gamers, \"The Blackmoor Bunch\".\nThe old stories and secrets have been closely held by the people who were there when it all began over 50 years ago, and are now finally revealed in the documentary Secrets of Blackmoor: The True History of Dungeons & Dragons.\nIt might be surprising to find out that this documentary began as an accident.  We really never thought we'd be doing this kind of film and we had no idea what we'd discover.  Yet, it has exploded into an obsession for us. \nJust over 5 years ago, myself, M. Griffith (call me Griff), and my partner Chris Graves, known collectively as \u201cThe Fellowship of the Thing,\u201d set out on an investigation into the history of role playing.  We did it by asking simple questions like: Who was the first player to die in a role playing game?\nOur search became worldwide as we reached out to experts all over the planet for help.  We ended up traveling to 10 different cites in search of answers.  We shot over 200 hours of movie footage and we found more than 20,000 documents and photographs.  It is difficult to show you just how enormous this project has become.\nIs this the first Dragon figure made for an RPG? It is!\nThis entire adventure has been a gamble for us.  Our first exploratory shooting trip could have been a complete failure.  We might have realized that there was nothing new to be found, and that making a movie about RPG's is just a silly idea, yet we\u2019d just spent about $10,000 on a crap shoot.\nInstead, we discovered that there was a group of incredibly fascinating people with interesting stories to tell.  There were many games developed by the Twin Cities gamers that have role playing in them, and that, to paraphrase what they tell us: the invention of RPG's did not happen overnight; it was an accumulation of ideas that evolved over many years. \nIs this the first indication that a Fantasy RPG is happening in the twin cities? It is!\nThe sheer volume of people, life events, and games, cannot be covered in just one documentary.  It forces us to make a lot of hard decisions about what to cut and what to keep in this first in a series of films.\nThis is only Volume 1. We narrowed down the subject matter to fit into one 2-hour movie. This first movie examines where the very concept of the RPG came from, and how it led to Dungeons & Dragons.  Yet there are many other stories we found:  the genius behind the Dungeon! board game, John Snider's 1972 Sci-Fi Role Playing Game,  M.A.R. Barker's World of Tekumel, and others.  We look forward to following up on this film with another volume with more detail about Gary and Dave collaborating on the creation of Dungeons & Dragons. \nFor now, we want to focus on getting this movie done.\nThank you, \nChris and Griff (Co-Directors of SECRETS of BLACKMOOR)\nThis year is a significant landmark in RPG history.  It was during Christmas break, 50 years ago, that David Wesely tested a game he invented. It was set in a town named Braunstein. With that one game, David Wesely took the methods for roleplaying to new heights, and the Twin Cites gamers liked it so much that the term \"Braunstein\" became their term for all their RPG's.\nWe want to celebrate this occasion.  We also want people to know about Wesely's game. Anyone who supports us at Any Level will receive a special online screener of the 24 minute section of the film dedicated to Braunstein, available on Christmas Day, 2018.\nWatch this screener, and you will know the answer to \"who was the first player to die in an RPG?\". \nWe've also come up with several other \"Thank You\" gifts at a variety of levels that are located in the sidebar of this web page.\nVideo on Demand, DVD's, T-shirts, Dice Bags, and more...\n We have online screeners and DVD's of the movie.  We have a T-shirt designed by Bob Bledsaw (in 8 different colors and 7 sizes from XS to 3XL). The image shows Gerti the Dragon taking flight over Blackmoor Castle.  (\"Gerti\" is the name of the very first Dragon in fantasy RPG's).  There are handmade Dice Bags with the Blackmoor castle emblem also designed by Bob.  We know you won't want to miss out on those.\nWe also really want to highlight the truly special gifts!\nThe Braunstein Gift Pack:\nWe did say \"be one of the first to know the Secrets of Blackmoor,\" and we know some of you just can't wait to see the film.  We've created a gift level for those who want an insider sneak peek of the entire film - available on Christmas Day, 2018.  Sure, it won't be all slick and perfect like the final version, but if you want to see the film early, well, you'll have to put up with seeing a little bit less shine (you'll still get the final, polished version in February).\nWe think this is an ideal gift for the gamer in your family (whether it's you, or someone you know, who will truly enjoy being one of the first to see the movie). \n The Lost Dungeon of Tonisborg Deluxe Hard Bound Edition Book: \nOld School Fantasy Artwork from Tonisborg Dungeon Deluxe Edition Book\nA complete 10 level mega-dungeon module in a hard bound cover!\nWhile making the movie we discovered the never published Tonisborg Dungeon maps, the second fantasy RPG dungeon from the Twin Cities, that all thought had been long lost (it had been hidden away in a basement for decades).  We asked the original creator, Greg Svenson, how he felt about making a book with his dungeon maps in it, and he really liked the idea.  Then we got Daniel Boggs, game historian and designer, to contribute his design expertise along with his Champions of Zed, Open Game License, rules.  Lastly, we got ahold of Bob Bledsaw Jr. (Judges Guild), who had worked with his father on Dave Arneson's First Fantasy Campaign in 1977, and he came on board as well.\nOver the past year we've been putting together this historic Game Module, with personal background by Greg Svenson, maps, guidelines for old school play, and complete game rules.\nIt even includes many quotes like this one, by the original RPG'ers:\n\"Anxiety leads to doubt - doubt leads to fear - and fear, if properly manipulated - leads to terror!\" - Robert Kuntz - Game Author and Theoretician\nIt is written so that a novice can learn to play, yet we've put some old gamer wisdom into the book that even experienced grognards will appreciate.\nThe Minnesota Gaming Experience:\n(Limit 6 to 10 gifts)\nThe Minnesota Gamers playing one of the games that, through their desire to improve playability and have more fun, led to the invention of RPG's\nThis is something truly unique. When we told David Megarry, author of the Dungeon! (1975) board game, and member of the group who invented RPG's, about our upcoming Kickstarter, he asked if he could help us.\nWe weren't really sure what he was planning.  Several days later he phoned us and proposed that he would host a mini game convention in the Twin Cities.\nThe Minnesota Gaming Experience was born! \nRoss Maker (left) and Bob Meyer (Right) at the Dave Arneson memorial Blackmoor game session, 2018\nSome of our intrepid supporters will be able to come and play many of the games that influenced the creation of RPG's with the very people who created the games.  It's like a cruise ship vacation to Gamer Fantasy Island. \nWe like the idea so much, that both Chris and I will be coming to the event.  I'm even going to run a game session for those brave enough to risk entering Tonisborg Dungeon.\nJust to sum it all up:  It's a week of gaming at a bed and breakfast.  All your meals are taken care of.  You play a different game every day.  All you have to do is get yourself to the Twin Cities.\nEvent begins March 28th and ends April 3rd, 2019 (Check the sidebar for a list of games, and referees.)\nThere are some stipulations:\n-We have to get at least 6 people to support us at this level, or we will have to refund the donations.\n-We do not provide transportation to Minnesota, but we will have airport pick-ups and drop- offs.\nPersonally Delivered Dungeon! Board Game:\n(Limit 1 gift at this level)\nDavid Megarry with his original Dungeon! game map prototype\nThis Gift Level is another of David Megarry's brainstorms.  What can we say?  He really likes the movie. \nIt is the most elite of gifts: an original, unopened 1st edition copy of Dungeon! - the adventure board game from 1975.\nWell, ok. That's sorta cool--but it gets better! \nDavid Megarry will hand deliver the game to your house anywhere in the USA or Canada.  He will also give a personal presentation to you & your friends on the history of the Twin Cities Gamers, and how he came up with the idea for his game.  After that, he will show you how Dungeon! is played and help you have a fun gaming session with several, already opened copies. (The true importance of Dungeon! is revealed in Secrets of Blackmoor).  \nWho knows, maybe the Secret Team will tag along and shoot some video of the event.  \nMore information about all of the gifts are in the sidebar. \nIs this a photo of members of the Blackmoor Bunch in Dave Arneson's Living Room, 1971?

Are they \"successful\" in life? Can they get into college if they choose to follow that route? How do they make a living, get jobs or start their own businesses? And how do they define success for themselves?\nSELF-TAUGHT is a documentary that answers these questions, as told through the stories of six remarkable young adults who share their personal challenges and successes of growing up unschooled. As they talk about their childhoods and their desire to learn in their own unique ways, they also reflect upon how these experiences helped shaped who they have become as adults. \nIn addition to these main stories we\u2019ll also hear from experts with extensive experience in alternative education models, child development and psychology, and and delve into what it means to be a self-directed learner. Plus we'll spend time at a center that has been changing the lives of teen learners for more than two decades.\nThere is a growing interest worldwide in alternative ways of learning and families everywhere are seeking answers and new learning opportunities that will empower their children. I believe these stories will resonate strongly with those already on the path of self-directed learning and inspire and encourage those who are considering taking their education into their own hands.\nHOW WILL THE MONEY BE USED?\nI mentioned briefly in the video above what stages the film has to go through next in order to be completely finished. Here's a specific breakdown of exactly what those stages are and how the money raised in this campaign will be used:\n\nMUSIC  - The music for any film makes a huge difference to the final experience. It truly transforms it and I'd like to have compelling music in this film too. This part of the finishing process is by far the biggest and most expensive task. A great composer is worth their weight in gold.\nCOLOR-CORRECTION - For the most part, the footage in the film looks fantastic. But there are always shots that need some extra help and additionally, a skilled colorist can give the whole film a unified look that makes it flow seamlessly from shot to shot so that your viewing experience is not interrupted by distracting visuals. \nSOUND MIXING - There's nothing worse than not being able to hear the sound of a film properly, or having the music and dialogue competing with each other for aural space. All the sound in a film has to be balanced and mixed so that you can hear everything well and get the full audio experience.\n   HOW KICKSTARTER WORKS \nKickstarter is all-or-nothing funding so if I don't make it to $15,000 no one will receive the awesome rewards, I'll get absolutely nothing and the film won't get finished. That would be a sad scenario. I understand that not everyone will be able to make a financial contribution at this time, but please know that every dollar counts towards reaching the goal, and every effort you make to promote the project will help me reach more potential backers. So regardless of whether you can personally donate, please promote this project on Facebook, twitter and on your other social media platforms. I'm grateful for your support.\nCAN WE EXCEED OUR KICKSTARTER GOAL? \nAbsolutely! If we raise more than the $15,000 goal, I'll be able to take the film that much further along in the process. I can use the extra funds to promote the film more widely, organize screenings and perhaps even make personal appearances at screening events. So if you are passionate about the idea of freedom in education, if you were inspired by my last film Class Dismissed, then please consider donating whatever you can to this project. Every donation counts and I really want to share this film with you.\nThank you so much for your support, Jeremy Stuart, Director", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are always risks and challenges involved in making an independent film with a low budget, delays can happen for all kinds of reasons, but with a solid track record making my last film Class Dismissed and with over 25 years experience in the film industry as a veteran editor, I feel very confident that I can deliver a fantastic film for you.

Read on...\nIn The Crusoe Crew, you'll work together with the other players to explore islands, solve puzzles, and find rubies, pearls, and statuettes that will allow you to buy items for the next session!\nYou are going to really love this experience! Here are some key features of the game.\n Contents include: 4 - 96 page soft cover books, 1 map/rulesheet, Box with magnet enclosure and ribbon for easy removal of the books from the box. Deluxe pledge also includes a special box with deluxe ruby, pearl, and statuette game pieces!\n Family friendly gameplay for 1-4 players ages 7 and up (or even younger with adult help!). Also highly enjoyable for grown \"kids at heart\" like most of us gamers are!\n Virtually no setup time and minimal rules! Start playing in as little as 5 minutes.\n Great character choices! Play as one of the (fictional) children of the famed Robinson Crusoe, each with their own book and a different talent that will make you personal experience differ from that of the other players.\n Explore multiple islands several times and with different characters giving you hours of replayability.\n A multi-player gamebook experience... if you always wished you could share your game book experiences with your friends than you are going to absolutely love this game. I'm in heaven playing our new Graphic Novel Adventures books and this game takes it to a whole new level.\nLet's take a deeper look into the game and how it works...\nYour father, the famed Robinson Crusoe, has fallen ill. \nWhen his pirate friend, the infamous Raloo Pali, shows up to recruit Robinson for his treasure hunting skills, he has no other choice but to rely on the Crusoe kids to do the job. \nYou'll each choose one of the four Crusoe kids (it is ok if you have fewer players and only choose some!). \nKik - (pronounced like \"Kick\")  has exceptional strength, not to mention a hammer and explosives for uhh... select circumstances.\n Sarah - she can talk to animals and her cat Purr sometimes sniffs out secrets.\nGabby - she is the queen of riddles and can solve puzzles easier than her siblings.\nNeta - he is incredibly agile and can reach otherwise difficult or impossible to reach spaces.\n Next, you'll decide which of the 3 treasure types you want to prioritize as a team, rubies (easiest), pearls (average), or statuettes (difficult). You'll still search for ALL treasure types, but they will be converted at the end of the game for scoring purposes.  \nNow you are ready to play! Select an island on the map to explore and each player will turn to that frame in their respective book!\nPlayers will need to be on the lookout for hidden treasures, hidden numbers, and ways to use their unique character talents. The following is an example of how the game plays with multiple characters. Click on the image if you'd like to see a higher resolution version of it! \nClick the image to see a higher resolution version of it!\nTrack what you find and how much time has passed on the rule sheet (printable version will be available for download). You'll have only 5 days* to find the most treasure possible, so good luck!\n*within the game, a day ends when you see the sun symbol as on the character sheet below \nFor a more fun way to track your treasure, back for the Deluxe version and get a piece pack that includes plastic Rubies, Pearls, and little Statuette miniatures! \n*Components and sizes not final and subject to change.\nEach time your group finds a treasure during the game, you'll take one of those pieces and put it in the treasure box. At the end of the game during scoring, you'll simply count how many of each piece you have!\nThe Crusoe Crew has multiple islands to explore. Some frames will have you mark 1 day off on your sheet when you see a sun icon. When 5 days have passed, the game is over. You can get a lot of play from each of the main islands exploring each multiple times and you will also want to experience them with each of the different characters. All of these factors add up to many hours of enjoyment for you, your family, your friends, and your game group!  \n\"Crusoe Crew is the type of game that can create a memorable experiences for your friends and family.  As a solo player, I wanted to squeeze all the fun out of all four books. There is enough content to keep you busy for awhile. \" - Jeremy, Jambalaya Plays Games\nWe want to make this as simple as possible, so there are just three options for pledging.\nAdditional copies of any pledge can be added by multiplying the pledge amount by the number of that pledge you would like to receive, no additional shipping is required.\nDue to our localization agreement we can only offer rewards for shipping to the USA, Canada, and Australia. We apologize for any inconvenience or disappointment this may cause to our customers in other regions. Please be on the lookout for other language versions of the game in your region. \n ****Advanced Shipping option for USA and Canada****\nWe are offering a limited number of pledges to receive The Crusoe Crew early. We can do this by air shipping a pallet of games over from China. Backers choosing advanced shipping will receive the game 4 - 8 weeks early! \nThe Crusoe Crew is a fully developed Graphic Novel Adventures cooperative game contained within four books and is our English translation of the game recently released in France from publishers Makaka Editions and Blue Orange Europe. We are producing the English version under a localization agreement and as a result, we will not be offering stretch goals for this campaign. However, it should be noted that our Deluxe Piece Pack is a Kickstarter Exclusive item not available anywhere else and will not be offered into retail distribution.  We do reserve the right to offer the Deluxe Piece Pack at conventions, direct from our website, or for other promotional purposes. \nInstead of stretch goals, throughout the campaign we will be revealing more about each character and how they work and showing off some simulated puzzles you can try to solve. Don't worry, we'll change things so they won't be from the actual game (no spoilers!) \nWe'll follow this map starting with a Kik update on November 15th!\nThe books are soft cover with good quality and no binding issues. The map and rules are printed on card stock and the cardboard box has a magnetized enclosure and is of good quality with color printing inside an out. The Crusoe Crew game will not be printed at the same printer where we printed the first printing of the Graphic Novel Adventures books. As with all of our products, we stand behind the quality and if there are any issues we will happily take care of you.\nAuthor and Artist: Shuky and Gorobei\nEnglish text layout, editing, and development: Shaun Varsos, Evan Derrrick, and A.J.

Any request for refund after more than two weeks has passed will be subject to a 10-20% cancellation fee to account for KS fees and administrative expenses.\n\nAbandoned Pledges\nWe require that our pledge manager and/or survey be completed in a timely manner so that we can process orders efficiently and on time.

We give plenty of time to complete the survey, so please do so in a timely manner to avoid any inconvenience or delay. Any survey that is not completed within 30 days from final fulfillment (defined as the last date of shipping of KS rewards for your region) will result in your pledge being considered abandoned and any amount pledged will be considered a gift in support of the project. \n\nBy pledging to this project you understand the risks, challenges, and pledge terms we have laid out here, and agree to be bound by them.

Players assume the role of ship Captains plying the mains of the Third Imperium.\nThe game has been designed to accommodate 2-4 players, but it also supports solo play and we anticipate releasing special solo play scenarios and game modes.  Single and two-player games should last between 30 and 60 minutes, though early learning games will take longer.\nTraveller is a customizable card game, which means you get to make your own deck.  However, it is not collectable.  There are no rarities.  Every product is a fixed set, so you always know exactly what you're getting. \nYou can learn more about our game from our website, forums, facebook, twitter and boardgamegeek pages.\nThe Digital Version\nThis Kickstarter is a follow up to our original 2016 project.  Now we hope to take the physical card game and bring it to an online platform where captains can play with others at any time, anywhere in the world.\nCurrently the game is in what we'd call pre-alpha.  The shell of the game rules have been programmed in, but we haven't converted all the cards yet.  That's where you come in!  The funds from this Kickstarter will be used to cover the costs associated with finishing the online version.\nThe initial focus is on two player, captain vs. captain play.  That base should be sufficient to allow for the solo play scenarios as well, though programming them in hasn't been started.\nPlatforms\nCurrently the pre-alpha build works with Windows, Mac and Linux.  We'd like to follow up with Android and iOS, which our design team tells us is feasible, though it will take a good amount of UI work and some additional programming.\nExample of Play\nOur basic mechanics are an icon-driven race game, with ample opportunities to interact with, and even engage in piracy against, other players. All Captains must also contend with a hostile galaxy and the looming threat of insolvency.\nGame play proceeds through six phases.\nReady (ready cards, refill hand, determine initiative and prepare for the rest of the round)\nAdventure (play Complication cards, decide which Contract to pursue, or declare Piracy!)\nProcurement (procure permanents into play)\nAction (alternate taking actions)\nResource (collect resource tokens)\nResolution (Resolve Complications, fulfill Contracts and conduct Piracy)\nThe full rulebook is available for download from our website.\nRewards\nSome of our rewards are digital, and some are physical.  When selecting reward tiers or Add Ons, please carefully review.  If you're not sure, post in the comments or send us a message and we'll be happy to help!\nAll physical rewards will require backers to pay actual shipping costs.  Shipping costs will be calculated upon the conclusion of the campaign, when we send the backer surveys.\n Will the custom cards for TAS and Patron members be digital-only?\nNo, the custom cards for the Traveller's Aid Society and Patron reward tiers will be available in both the print and digital formats. In fact, every card is going to be available in both formats!\nThe Digital Promo Pack, a collection of special promotional cards,is included to all backers at the Low Passage level and higher.

After being called to the bar, he worked in criminal defense and indigent legal services at places such as the Santa Clara County Public Defenders and the Bay Area Legal Aid Domestic Violence Restraining Order Clinic. After that, he entered private practice, primarily focused on indigent representation for Alameda County.  \nHe has been gaming all his life, first as a mascot and henchman in his father\u2019s gaming group, then a full member, before eventually becoming a game master of his own groups. Some of his favorite games include Traveller, RuneQuest, Through the Breach, Shadowrun, Vampire: The Masquerade, and Fading Suns. \nFor the last 10 years, Jeff has been Assistant RPG Coordinator for Kublacon, one of the West Coast\u2019s largest gaming conventions. He can usually be seen at the major Bay Area cons. \nIan Lee (Lead Developer) started playtesting CCGs in the late \u201890s, eventually working on more than half-a-dozen games sold by several publishers. He then worked on the design team for the Precedence CCG titles, Babylon 5 and Wheel of Time, during which he acquired experience in managing the interplay between CCG mechanics and maintaining the thematic draw of licensed IPs. \nIn addition to having been a certified judge for Magic: The Gathering competitive events, Ian was active in several CCG competitive play circuits, achieving Top Ten world-wide rankings in Babylon 5, Ultimate Combat and Vampire: The Eternal Struggle. \nHe brings over 20 years\u2019 experience, having participated in numerous CCGs in virtually every role, from player, competitive player, playtester and design and development. A fixture on the Northern California gaming convention circuit, he has been running a variety of RPG, CCG and board game events at local cons for over two decades.\nMatt Morgan (Lead Programmer) is our in-house programmer, with an almost unhealthy degree of mastery over both programming and gaming!  He has worked in multiple roles and disciplines, including back and front-end development, DevOps, testing and cloud architecture.  Matt was also the programmer for Chromancer.  Unfortunately the business decisions taken by the project's creator and the company meant that backers were never able to play the game, but Matt's work in it was first rate! \nTony Yin (Project Manager) is a 'first generation' gamer who played Chainmail and Greyhawk at the infancy of D&D. He also played Runequest in its early days, in the campaign of one of its authors, Warren James, at the old San Jose area gaming cafe, The Bandersnatch. Tony also began his adventures in the Third Imperium at about the same time. He still has a full set of LBBs, all with price tags showing just how much further a buck went in 1981. \nIn addition to RPGs, he was a fierce competitor in the board games Star Fleet Battles and Squad Leader. Having attended the first PacificCon, his passion for gaming remains strong to this day, especially for MMORPGS such as Eve and World of Warcraft, and 4x titles like Master of Orion and Civilization. \nTony has over 30 years of experience in the Silicon Valley, and has had extensive dealings with contract manufacturers (CM) in Asia since the late 90's. He has decades of experience developing and launching consumer and commercial products, including packaging, print, logistics, traffic, and material management. \nAs a native born Chinese speaker, Tony is able to handle not just the planning and management of a project, but direct communication with various manufacturers and distributors. \nLocation for the Demonstration of Play video by Collector's Legion:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/collectorlegion/\nMusic in the videos provided by: http://www.bensound.com/royalty-free-music/2", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe card game and all associated art assets already exist, and our programmer is in house.

We jam-packed all of the Catacombs you love into this campaign!\nREWARDS\n  Unlocked stretch goals are included in all pledge levels.\nADD-ONS\n STRETCH GOALS\nCatacombs is a dexterity based, one vs many dexterity dungeon crawl. Four heroes are selected to protect the town of Stormtryne by battling their way through countless enemies before finally facing the dreaded Catacomb Lord.\nEach hero has their own unique set of actions, abilities, items or spells that aid them through the various rooms and encounters.\nThe Overseer player controls the monsters and the Catacomb Lord, acting as the adversary the heroes aim to defeat.\nThere is a near limitless combination of rooms to explore. Some rooms have a swarm of monsters that the heroes must fight through to succeed. Others provide unique encounters where the heroes can spend their hard earned gold on new items, healing services, or even gamble to gain every edge they can against the Overseer player.\nThe actions a character may take are determined by the rules provided on their cards in the form of shot sequences. Each shot does something different. Some do varying amounts of damage, while others can freeze opponents, scare them off, or teleport allies out of danger, to name a few. There are dozens of shots in Catacombs.\nAnimated GIFs may take a moment to load.\nJust using a shot doesn't always guarantee its action, however. In order to be effective, players will have to train their dexterity skills and accurately flick wooden discs. Ducking in and out of cover, positioning shots, and banking attacks off obstacles are essential skills to an experienced player.\nAnimated GIFs may take a moment to load.\nIf the heroes live long enough to breach the Catacomb Lord's Lair, they will meet their final test - battling the Catacomb Lord them self!\nRubber Playmats!\nWith the new Catacombs playmats, you will enjoy an incredibly smooth and consistent flicking experience. All of the premium playmats are our standard 12.6 x 26.8\" (320 x 680 mm) size.\nWall & playmat dimensions.\nEvery playmat has two unique designs, one on either side. Enjoy a wide variety of room settings to complement the fantasy experience of Catacombs.\nThree different mats, six unique sides. Prototype mats shown, actual product may vary.\n The surface of the playmats are a very fine cloth weave, which is smooth to the touch. This allows the wood discs to glide across with impressive precision, making every shot satisfyingly consistent.\nBigger, better box.\nWe shrunk down the height and width of the box, making it Kallax shelf friendly. Then we increased the depth, to make room for the new rubber mats. In addition, there's now plenty of room for expansion content, and a new plastic tray.\nGloomhaven box for size comparison. Prototype shown.\nFits in your Kallax shelf.\nImproved Wall System\nWith this printing, we are introducing our custom plastic cross stands for the barrier walls. These eliminate the old hinged design, which were prone to tearing. We also doubled the wall thickness for rigidity. These improvements result in a very sturdy and more resilient wall system.\nAnimated GIFs may take a moment to load.\n\nNo More Holes, Bigger Obstacles!\nWe removed the obstacle holes from the play surfaces, replacing them with obstacle icons, just like in Catacombs & Castles. This allows us to have different obstacle placements between the two sides. With no holes, you can even use your awesome new playmats with your other games!\nWith this change, the previous obstacle discs became too light to stay in place. As such, we have increased their size by five times.\nBrand New Tutorial Manual\nIn addition to the revamped reference manual, we have written a brand new manual with a comprehensive step by step walk-through of an entire game. Learning Catacombs just got a lot easier.\n MANUALS\nTake a look at our fully revised and updated reference manual, and our brand new tutorial manual! Both manuals are subject to change.\nThe tutorial manual provides a brief overview of the game, and a comprehensive step by step walk-through for beginners. The reference manual has not been stripped of any rules, so you do not have to skip back and forth (like some other dual manual games do).\n REVIEWS\nPlease note that the components shown in the videos below are from previous printings and will not reflect the newer, improved iteration of the game.\nDexterity Game System & Deximat logos.\nCatacombs Third Edition is one of a number of tabletop games that are designed using Elzra\u2019s Dexterity Game System\u2122. The Dexterity Game System\u2122 sets a standard of flicking mechanics that are common between all Dexterity Game System\u2122 titles, making them easy to pick up and learn.\nElzra\u2019s Deximat\u2122 branded playmats are made of high quality neoprene and are integrated with our dexterity based game titles. They provide a smooth surface so that each of your Catacombs adventures are consistent and exciting.\n For customer support:\n Please email: ks@elzra.com\nPlease note also that we cannot respond to specific customer support requests on the comments page of this project. You will be directed to email ks@elzra.com.

If you fail to confirm your pledges after this deadline, your rewards will be shipped to you from the Elzra warehouse in Canada. As such, shipping costs may be considerably higher for those outside of Canada and the US.\nOur guiding policy is that our backers receive their rewards before they are made available at retail or conventions. We will make our best effort to adhere to this policy, however we may not be able to meet this goal in some cases. If this is a concern, we encourage you to wait until the retail release of the game.

For this campaign, we are using the same overseas production team and printer that produced Catacombs Conquest.\n\nFor this campaign, we will continue to use a Pledge Manager to manage customer orders and to mitigate miscommunication related to shipping address changes.\n\nWe are fully aware of potential delays that may happen with products that are produced overseas: printer production schedules, major holidays (especially Chinese New Year), shipping, and customs delays. We will work diligently to minimize these types of disruptions and promise to communicate transparently with our backers if they occur.\n\nWe have estimated delivery for April 2019. Due to the global logistics involved in shipping, some regions may receive their rewards sooner than others.\n\nWe have prepared as much as possible for a successful project (the core artwork assets have already been approved by the printer). \n\nIf the product cannot be produced and/or delivered due to some unforeseen circumstance, we will refund pledges.\n\n=======\nRefunds\n=======\n\nRefunds may be given within 60 days of the campaign ending, including fees.

Likewise, all of the quests and encounters can be run as individual one-off games or strung together to create a full story arc.\nThis book also doubles as a graphic novel collection of the webcomic's second chapter which can be enjoyed separately from the game, or together!\nThis book is supplemented with a digital bundle that includes everything you need to print and play the game including:\n\u00b7 Character Sheets and Map Markers\n\u00b7 NPC Sheets and Map Markers\n\u00b7 Three Brand New Maps\n\u00b7 Trap Tiles\n\u00b7 Enchanted Woods Travel Tiles\n\u00b7 Loot Cards\nIn addition to the Mystery of the Moon Stone adventure module, this Kickstarter will fund the publication of the first full-length Sidekick Quests rule book. So far, all of our rules have been made available in an abbreviated quick-start format that can be downloaded on the Sidekick Quests website. Now, for the first time ever, we have a fully fleshed-out book that covers character roles, advanced mechanics, character advancement, the ins and outs of the Kingdom of Chivel setting, and more.\nFinally, we have some beautiful pieces planned for stretch goals that will be rewarded to everyone who pledges at and above the $30 level. This includes heavy duty punch-out cards for the shifting map mechanics in two of our quests, a Sidekick Quests GM screen, and even a reprint of our first adventure book: The Secret of the Sewer Wizard for those who may have missed our first successful Kickstarter.\nSidekick Quests is an all-ages role-playing game designed to be an introduction to the genre for those who have never played before, specifically children and student as young as kindergartners! This is the second volume of Sidekick Quests. It tells the adventure of the Mystery of the Moon Stone as both a full length graphic novel and as a roleplaying game campaign! The story and game are both created with families in mind, so adults can read the comic with children and then play together through the quests and encounters detailed within. The GM and players can read the story, get a first-hand look at what their characters can do, and then sit down and relive the events themselves.\nSidekick Quests  introduces all the standard mechanics like movement, initiative order, abilities, combat and drama you'd expect in a roleplaying game. Players protray character roles featuring a diverse cast of adventuring sidekicks that are pre-made for quick play but with room for enough customization to truly make them your own. Abilities and skills are clearly labeled with a system of colors and icons for quick and easy reference, and advancing your character\u2019s strengths is a simple matter of exchanging gold stars earned in-game.\nSidekick Quests the RPG is meant to introduce younger players to the world of roleplaying games in hopes that both children and adults could play together and still have a fun and unique experience. Many of the rules in Sidekick Quests are simplified specifically for ease of play with younger players. \nThousands of players of all ages have already enjoyed the print to play versions available for sale at the sidekickquests.com online store.

Part roleplaying game, part web comic, it's unique, and delightful. Kids and parents alike will love James Stowe's lively, wonderful creation - as my daughter and I already do. - John Kovalic, cartoonist and illustrator\n[James Stowe\u2019s] world and characters captures imaginations in young and old alike. Sidekick Quests is doing a huge part to seed the next generation of tabletop gamers with positive messages and healthy table habits that encourage inclusiveness and fair play. You cannot go wrong laying down your hard-earned dollars on this campaign. - Brian Patterson, cartoonist and creator of d20Monkey\n[Sidekick Quests] feels like the best game of DND you played as a twelve year old indoor kid, in all the best ways. - Chris O\u2019Neil, Kobolds Ate My Baby and 9th Level Games  \nSidekick Quests is engaging, dynamic, and everything that a kid's RPG should be. It's got old-school charm, indie sensibilities, and is just plain fun. - Tracy Barnett, Exploding Rogue Studios\nJames took what could've been a one-off internet meme and turned it into an earnest love letter to fantasy adventure. - Daniel Solis, award-winning game designer", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nEvery publishing project carries risks. Sidekick Quests is written, illustrated, developed and directed by King Octopus Games; two dedicated game makers, James Stowe and Anna Izenman. If either James and Anna are to be struck by lightning or encounter personal emergencies it will have a bigger impact on the completion of this project than a larger company might see. \n\nThis is the second Sidekick Quests kickstarter for James Stowe. The first, The Secret of the Sewer Wizard, was a success but there were delays in production. We learned a lot from that first kickstarter. First, both books involved in this kickstarter are over 75% written already. The writing is intended to be completely finished by the end of this campaign. Also all the stretch goals add to the quality of the finished product. We intend to use a fulfillment service to handle distribution. Sidekick Quests is no longer a one man operation either. Now development is handled by the small team of King Octopus Games. \n\nKing Octopus Games uses outside suppliers and shippers for printing and manufacturing, which involves possible risks and delays that we can\u2019t foresee or control.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Receive Project Updates", "descp": "Donate at this level to follow our progress and receive all project updates!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2018"}], "stat": ["6 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "Single PDF", "descp": "Choose a PDF download of either the Mystery of the Moon Stone adventure module or the Sidekick Quests Rule Guide, as well as the digital bundle.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2019"}], "stat": ["5 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 15 or more", "title": "Both PDFs", "descp": "You will receive a PDF download of both Mystery of the Moon Stone and the Rule Book as well as the digital bundle", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2019"}], "stat": ["41 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 30 or more", "title": "Single Book", "descp": "You will receive a physical copy and a PDF download of one book of your choice, the digital bundle, and all unlocked stretch goals.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Only certain countries"}], "stat": ["16 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 50 or more", "title": "Both Books", "descp": "You will receive a physical copy and PDF download of both The Mystery of the Moon Stone and the Rule Book, the digital bundle, and all unlocked stretch goals.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Only certain countries"}], "stat": ["77 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 55 or more", "title": "One Book and a Sketch", "descp": "You will receive a physical copy and PDF download of one book of your choice, a sketch of your favorite Sidekick Quests character, the digital bundle, and all unlocked stretch goals.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Only certain countries"}], "stat": ["1 backer"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 75 or more", "title": "Both Books and a Sketch", "descp": "You will receive a physical copy and PDF download of both books, a sketch of your favorite Sidekick Quests character, the digital bundle, and all unlocked stretch goals.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Only certain countries"}], "stat": ["7 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 100 or more", "title": "Be a Part of the Game - Single Book", "descp": "Back at this level and we will name a piece of Sidekick Quests lore after you!

Facebook | Twitter | Discord | Newsletter\nOmno is a single player adventure that will take you through lush forests, across a sun blasted desert, over a frigid tundra, and where the power of a lost civilisation will even carry you to the clouds. On the way you will meet strange creatures, encounter many surprises and maybe make a friend.\n\nBesides offering an interactive world, Omno challenges you with puzzles, hidden secrets and obstacles to overcome in 3D puzzle platformer style.\n\nIf you want to see Omno in action, here is some gameplay footage of the game:\nThe world of Omno is teeming with creatures great and small for you to observe and interact with. Shy crab-like rocks, helpful turtles, maybe even a friendly dinosaur to ride?\nYou must unlock the hero\u2019s true potential and master unique skills to continue their journey.\nYour magic staff is the key to powering forgotten relics, and will allow you to dash lighting fast across platforms, glide over land, sail above the clouds and more!\nThe game covers a wide variety of landscapes and is built with state-of-the-art development tools and tricks (I sometimes show behind the scene stuff in my newsletter if you are interested) to create vast areas while ensuring a stable framerate.\nThe audio of Omno features a melancholic, mysterious and at times epic  soundtrack. For the music of the trailer I worked with the versatile and experienced composer Benedict Nichols and I hope I can keep up this great collaboration with the help of the backers.\nI have been working on Omno for over 2 years (the last 8 months fulltime) and now I would say Omno is about 60% complete. I took a lot of time to nail down the tech behind the game which is pretty much done already! Also all the core mechanics are finished and all worlds are in a playable stage.\nThe main thing missing is putting all pieces together, replacing placeholders with actual assets and adding way more animals, a lot of secrets to discover and overall more love to the game, which takes time of course.\nOmno is developed by myself (Jonas Manke), a solo indie dev from Germany. Before Omno I gained production experience as a freelance animator for 10 years on many movies and games (lately 'State of Decay' series - check my personal website or IMDB for more). Working for myself in this competitive environment not only helped me gain a lot of experience in game development but also in planning projects, setting realistic deadlines and budgets. I met great people and inspiring artists along my way who I talk to on a daily basis to receive the hardest and highly qualified feedback.\nOmno is currently planned to release on Steam (Windows) in the second half of 2019, though I would love to port the game to other platforms (Switch, PS4, XBOX) if there is enough funding for it.\nThe game will support gamepad and keyboard input at launch and will release in English, though I might add further languages down the line.\nthe actual look might differ from this image\nWhile running a Kickstarter campaign comes with a lot of risk and requires a great deal of work, there are several reasons why I think a crowdfunding campaign makes a lot of sense for Omno:\nDeveloping the game together: Since the beginning of Omno I have always listened to feedback and enjoyed talking with fans of the game, and a Kickstarter campaign means I would be able to get even more direct feedback from backers.\nCreative freedom: While there is a good amount of interest from publishers for Omno I would love to stay independent and finish the game with complete creative freedom.\nMoney (of course): The money raised by the Kickstarter would mostly be used to cover my living costs for the end of development and to pay some additional collaborators for music and sound. If the campaign is overfunded I have lots of ideas for stretch goals (did someone say consoles? ;) ).", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI\u2019m probably not the first one to tell you that game development always bears certain risks.

Together you\u2019ll face deadly foes, find treasures that are permanently added to your starting decks, and earn experience that you'll spend to improve your characters' skills, abilities, and starting health. \nAdd-Ons\nTo order an add-on, just increase your pledge by the appropriate amount.

Your opponents won't know what your quests are, but you may show your quests to your teammates. \nAt the beginning of the game, shuffle the Relic cards and deal one face down into a \"relic pile\" for each quest card in the game. When you complete a quest, reveal it to all players, then you acquire a random relic from the relic pile for free.\nThe extra relics (those not in the relic pile) get shuffled into the market deck, adding powerful new items to the market. \nThe Ancestry Pack\nThis 20-card pack allows you to play Hero Realms as a Dwarf, Elf, Ogre, Orc, or Smallfolk. You can use any race with a generic starting deck, or combine them with any character pack. So you could play as an ogre wizard, an elven ranger, a dwarven fighter, or any one of the dozens of new race-class combinations. That means tons of options for the makeup of your party for cooperative play, and literally hundreds of possible new PVP match-ups. \nEach race comes with four cards.\nAn Ancestry card that shows that race\u2019s health modifications and any special rules that apply to that race.\nAn ancestral skill or ability card that starts the game in play. \nAnd two cards that modify your starting deck. \nEvery race has its own strengths and weaknesses, giving them a unique play feel while still being an even match against each other or against a standard human deck.\nThe Lost Village Campaign Deck\nYou now stand in Rathiel\u2019s office, where the Lord-Governor of Thandar has given you and each of your companions a title \u2013 Defender of Thandar \u2013 and a new mission.\n\u201cGo to Heart\u2019s End. Go and find out what happened there. Perhaps this Ruinos Sect is again up to some malevolence.\u201d\n\"What has befallen he people of Heart\u2019s End?\", you ask.\n\u201cThat\u2019s the problem,\u201d the Lord-Governor says. \u201cThe entire village is missing. Two weeks ago a trio of tithe priests vanished on their rounds. They were last seen on the road to Heart\u2019s End. At the request of the High Priest, I sent a small troop of soldiers to investigate. Only their captain returned.\u201d\nThe Lord-Governor gestures to a guardsman who opens a side door. A man who must be the captain is helped into the room and gently lowered into a chair. He looks freshly bathed and his clothes are clean, but his eyes are unfocused and you sense his mind is far from this room.\nThe Lord-Governor kneels next to the captain\u2019s chair. He clasps the man\u2019s hand and speaks softly. \u201cThese are friends, Goran. Tell them what you told me. Tell them about Heart\u2019s End.\u201d\nGoran\u2019s head lolls for a moment, and you fear the captain is about to lose consciousness. Then he opens his mouth. His voice is trembling and you struggle to make out the words. \u201cGone\u2026 all gone.\u201d\n\"Do you mean the  villagers are dead?\" you ask in soft, calm voice, trying not to upset him further.\n\u201cNot dead\u2026 no\u2026 bodies...\u201d Goran frowns as if remembering something and then his face pales. He stands suddenly, knocking the Lord-Governor back, and his terrified eyes dart around the room. \u201cRed eyes!\u201d he shouts, \u201cRed eyes! Red eyes!\u201d\n\u201cHold him,\u201d Rathiel commands, and two guardsman restrain the struggling captain. After a short struggle Goran\u2019s eyes roll back, and you realize the poor man has lost consciousness. After the guardsmen carry the captain from the room, the Lord-Governor addresses you. \u201cYou now have the same knowledge I do. Please. Go to Heart\u2019s End and bring me answers.\u201d\nThis campaign deck features a full color adventure book and over 100 cards including 12 oversized Master cards!  \nVideos and Reviews\nProject Notes\nShipping\nWe will be shipping to backers directly from fulfillment centers in The US, EU, Canada, Australia, and Asia.\nOur goal is to get product to our backers as soon as possible. When product arrives at one of our fulfillment centers, we will begin the process of shipping to backers in that region without waiting for product to arrive at other hubs. This means that backers in some regions may receive product before backers in others.\nIMPORTANT - For this Kickstarter you will be charged shipping separately after this Kickstarter concludes. This will be done via the Pledge Manager which will be sent out early next year. What you are charged for shipping will be base on our actual cost to get your rewards to you from your regions fulfillment center.  \nHere is an estimate of shipping cost by region. Keep in mind this is just an estimate and cost may vary based on the size and weight of your package based on the quantity of unlocked stretch goals and add-ons you choose to get. \nUSA (Contiguous 48): $10-$16\nAlaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico: $15-$30\nCanada: $19 - $29\nEU: $18 - $27\nNorway, Switzerland: $33-$39\nChina, Macoa, Hong Kong: $12-$19\nRest of Asia $21-$33\nAustralia $21-$30\nNew Zealand $21-$36\nRest of the World: $43-$79\nUnfortunately we don't ship to Afghanistan, Brazil, Kazakhstan, Russia, or Ukraine.  \n*Kickstarter Exclusives\nThese are exclusive items for Kickstarter backers, with remaining stock available through conventions and special promotions only. Kickstarter exclusives will eventually (in a year or two) be remade with new art for general sale. \nThe Kickstarter Exclusive version will be forever identifiable by its original art. \nNothing is final until it is printed. \nWe are still doing playtesting and development of these sets, so cards may change. All art, card text, and packaging pictured is subject to change. The final versions you receive may not exactly match what is pictured here.\n A closer look at the add-on playmats: \nFearless Charge Playmat\nPhoenix Plume Playmat\nKeening Bat Form Campaign Playmat\nEnraged Bear Campaign Playmat\nLaughing Shadow Campaign Playmat\nRuinos Archpriestess Campaign Playmat", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nComponents, including art and layout is subject to change before the final product ships.\n\nWith any printing, there is risk of delay in the proofing, printing or packing steps. With overseas printing there are additional possible delays from shipping and customs. \n\nAlso, we tend to be perfectionists, and sometimes we will do multiple redesigns to get the game play just right. \n\nThe estimated delivery date for this Kickstarter is December 2019, but please keep in mind this is just an estimate. We will work hard to ship your games on time, but our number one concern is that the games be awesome. If we have to delay delivery to improve the product, we will.\n\nBased on delays in delivery of our recent Kickstarters, we added a buffer to this estimated delivery date, so while it is possible we may deliver earlier than this date, it may also be later. If later delivery would be a serious problem for you, please consider not backing and waiting to pick up the product in its retail release instead.\n\nWe are pretty active on the comments while the Kickstarter campaign is live, so we can get your feedback and input.

These will give you some points but also additional pieces as rewards. Since you also keep the pieces you used to finish puzzles, your pool of pieces starts to grow.\nMaster the Strategy \u2014 Once you've built a sufficient pool of pieces to challenge the black (difficult) puzzles and even more of them at the same time, unleash the Master action! It allows you to put a piece on all of your puzzles in a single action.\nWin the game \u2014 Once the black puzzles are gone, the game ends as you rush to complete your remaining puzzles in the final round.

Newton Corporation, the most beloved company that ever existed, gifted the world with the hyper-local gravity engines and, together with them, eternal peace and prosperity. However, to provide an outlet for all the violence innate in humans in such periods of peace and to amuse the crowds, Newton Corporation sponsors a brutal distraction: the Zero Gravity Tournament. In this capture-the-flag game, you control a team of warriors whose life is devoted to entertaining the masses. Use the 3D arena to overthrow your enemies and please the public, score Cheers to win the match! \nWatch the gameplay 360-videos in the section\"FULL GAMEPLAY & RULES\".\n                                 In Zero Gravity, you control a team of 14 warriors in a spectacular capture-the-flag match. To win a game you need to score the agreed number of Cheers before the other players.  \nRULES\nBefore you start the game: \nSetup phase (once per game): choose your starting area and place your first Spawning Point, your Flag and your team's Commander; place the bomb at the center of the bottom side of the arena and set the target amount of Cheers needed to win the game.\nAfter you start the game, the game is based on Rounds, each one made of four phases:\nRestock phase: add new N-coins to your stock (2 + bonus earned during the game) and draw 2 Sponsor Cards;\nTrooper phase: generate 1 new Trooper close to each Spawning Point and perform an action with each one of your Troopers at no cost (Move/Attack, Run);\nChampion phase: use your N-coins to generate new Champions and perform actions with them (Move/Attack, Run, Jump, Power Jump or Drop) in order to score Cheers;\nScenario phase: roll 2 dice to randomly place new Crates and/or Beasts into the arena, then move them and use their abilities.\nThe first player that reaches the target amount of Cheers wins the game!\nSee the following sections for further details on the teams, game components and rules.\nTEAMS OVERVIEW\nThere are four teams fighting in the Zero Gravity arena: the Nordic Sharks, the Milwaukee Eagles, the Moscow Jackals and the Tokyo Demons. Each Team is composed of four Champions (1x Commander, 1x Sniper, 1x Jumper, 1x Harrier) and 10x Troopers: each player controls a team of fourteen right out of the box. All such miniatures are called Units and Zero Gravity contains 56 of them, all 40mm magnetic miniatures.\nEvery Team brings its own individual set of movements and attacks, but also unique abilities that set them apart from the others and affect all players' strategies.\nFear is meaningless to the Nordic Sharks: the mix of human and shark traits resulted from genetic improvements which also affect their behaviour in battle.  \nTeam Quirk - Hunters: Beasts cannot defend from the attacks of the Nordic Sharks.\nModern Valkyries, the Milwaukee Eagles team shows sculpted bodies and incredibly fast recovery speed. Don\u2019t tease them \u2013 they can hunt you down for eternity.  \nTeam Quirk - Healing Spirits: At the beginning of your Turn: you can restore up to two members of the Milwaukee Eagles by +1 Energy.\nThe Moscow Jackals hunt in packs to herd and capture their elusive prey. If you are looking to outnumber your enemy, this is the right team for you.  \nTeam Quirk - Jackals at the door: At the beginning of your Turn: put in play a Trooper in a cell adjacent to any member of the Moscow Jackals.\nThe Tokyo Demons are cruel cyborgs and ninjas trained to kill...in spectacular ways.  \nTeam Quirk - Warlords: Every time the Tokyo Demons score Cheer(s), add one extra Cheer.\nSPONSOR CARDS\nAt the beginning of the game, after the Setup, the Restock Phase provides the teams with the necessary resources to continue the battle. Newton Corporation allows sponsors to power-up the teams and each player, following turn order, can draw a Sponsor Card with unique abilities.\nSponsor Cards deck\nThere are 30 unique Sponsor Cards in the game, which allow Units to perform stronger attacks, grant special abilities, provide additional resources and much more.  \nExample of Sponsor Cards\nHOW TO SPAWN NEW UNITS \nThe rules set by Newton Corporation, carefully improved year after year, define the Trooper Phase to force the teams to deploy their Troopers before any of their Champions. You can place new Troopers into play and activate all of them for free. This creates a splendid commotion, loved by the crowd, and builds up the Climax of the show: the Champion Phase.\nIn the Champion Phase you can spawn Champions from your Spawning Points, use Sponsor Cards gained in the Restock Phase and, more importantly, activate the Champions. They can Move/Attack (melee, primary or secondary attack), Run, Jump, Power Jump or Drop (see the \"Movement and Attack\" section for further details on the unique mechanics allowed by Zero Gravity arena). \nSpawning Point inside a team's starting area\nHOW TO SCORE CHEERS \nThe objective of each Team is to score the highest possible amount of Cheers or to perform actions that will make this possible in the following Rounds.\nYou can obtain Cheers in the following cases:\nBring an enemy Flag from his/her starting area to your starting area on the opposite side of the arena (e.g. from A1 to B1 or viceversa)  - 15 Cheers \nDetonate the Bomb in the Gate - 10 Cheers \nDestroy an enemy Spawning Point with the Bomb - 8 Cheers \nEliminate an enemy Commander - 5 Cheers \nEliminate an enemy Harrier, Sniper or Jumper - 3 Cheers \nEliminate a Beast - 2 Cheers \nEliminate an enemy Trooper - 1 Cheer\nBring an enemy Flag from his/her starting area to your starting area on the same side of the arena (e.g. from A1 to A2 or vice versa) - 1 Cheer \n  Track your Cheers on your Team Sheet\nUNIQUE MOVEMENT AND ATTACK MECHANICS \nHere follows a summary of the main moves and attacks for all Units and Beasts:\nMOVE\nMove the Unit in any direction, for a number of cells equal to or lower than its Movement score, as indicated on the Team Sheet. \nATTACK\nMelee attacks may be delivered if the Target is adjacent to the Attacker (orange cells in the picture above). \nPrimary Attacks may be delivered if the Line of Sight is free: anything can obstruct the Line of Sight. It is possible to perform Primary Attacks within the same Surface or on the adjacent corridors (yellow cells in the picture above).\nSecondary Attacks may be delivered from the same areas where it is possible to Jump (the Line of Sight is always free). The Target can be in a 3x3 cell area around the corresponding position on the closest surface from their attacking point, as indicated in the illustration above. \nJUMP\nOnly Champions have the ability to Jump from one surface of the board to the corresponding position on the closest surface from their starting point (e.g. G6-G6).\nPOWER JUMP\nChampions have the ability to Power Jump to from one corridor of the board to the diametrically opposed one, on the cell with the same letter from their starting point (e.g. L-L).  \nDROP\nChampions have the ability to Drop from the top surface of the board to the corresponding position on the bottom surface. The landing cell can only be occupied by an Object (Bomb, Mine, Flag, Crate), in which case the appropriate effects can be applied, otherwise the Champions cannot Drop. \nChampions can never Drop from within the Team area.\nBEASTS\nNewton Corporation intervenes in each Tournament to \u201cmotivate\u201d the battling Teams. After the Champion Phase, in the Scenario phase, the player with the least amount of Cheers introduces Beasts in play on behalf of the Newton Corporation. The role of the Beasts is to disrupt a players\u2019 strategy, to bring chaos and shatter the Teams\u2019 spirit to entertain the crowds.\nThere are 30 Beasts (40mm): 10x Minotaur, 10x Minelayer, 10x Replicator.\nMinotaur - Hold in captivity after its creation by the Newton Corporation, the Minotaur is a walking disaster: he can hurl in any direction anyone adjacent to him. The only way to escape his violence is simple: never cross his path. \nMinelayer - In an attempt to create a regenerative bio-weapon, the Newton Corporation gave life to an uncontrollable and unpredictable being, capable of generating explosive mines from its body. Considering its limitless destructive power, there is no better place for it than the Zero Gravity Tournament! \nReplicator - Newton Corporation spent trillions of dollars to develop a faster mitosis, to speed-up the growth of their crops and livestock. The result was unexpected: the cells were reacting only when other Beasts were in the same area, and ended up duplicating only other Beasts. People say that this was the real goal of Newton Corporation, to fuel the never ending needs for the Zero Gravity Tournament...\nMinotaur, Replicator and Minelayer Bests\n OBJECTS & SETTING ELEMENTS \nThe Newton Corporation surely doesn\u2019t leave anything unattended: a special Bomb was developed for the Zero Gravity tournament to spice up the show. A teletransport technique was applied to the Flags of each Team, causing them to reappear in the Teams\u2019 Area if dropped outside. Overall, many other Objects and Setting Elements were created by the best scientists of the Newton Corporation to enhance the experience of the Zero Gravity Tournament: \nFULL GAMEPLAY & RULES \nHere you can find our awesome videos...360 degrees!

We are preparing all the content for the printout version (layout, pictures), thus there will be differences in its final version.\nDownload the DRAFT Rules here.\nCheck the FAQ to find some other details!\nIn the year 2130 humankind was saved by the most disruptive technology of the third millennium: the hyper-local gravity engines, capable of bending the universal law of gravity at the will of its creator - the Newton Corporation. The new technology quickly became an essential part of everyday life, tackling overpopulation by exponentially increasing living space and solving famine with vertical cultivations: in a matter of years, Newton Corporation became the most powerful and notorious company in the world.\nDespite all the good done by Newton Corporation, there were protests, strikes and even revolts of thousands of people who believed that these technological advancements were dangerous for the human species. The strong reputation of Newton Corporation convinced the world leaders to denounce such acts of violence and defend the many research facilities by the military forces.\nMany years passed and with them the protests faded. However, a group of fanatics kept on nourishing their anger and plotted an assault on the headquarters, leading to the murder of the Newton Corporation founder and CEO. The military arrested the culprits who were immediately sentenced to a public execution, to be aired across the planet as a warning against rebellion towards such a global benefactor.\n The execution was followed live by 99% of the world population. This exorbitant share is what pushed Newton Corporation to sponsor a spectacular and bloody event every year. Their goal was twofold: commemorating the punishment inflicted to the rebels and provide a single outlet for violence, so as to experience peace for the future year.\nWith the blessing of all world leaders and population, Newton Corporation developed new technologies capable of cloning the executed rebels, enhancing their abilities and peculiar traits. Four teams were created and sentenced to battle against each other for eternity, in the name of peace.\nFrom the ashes of those rebels new Champions were created: the Zero Gravity Tournament was born.\nZero Gravity comes with the Tournament map. In this 3D space, the players have few obstacles and can concentrate on obliterating each other in a marvellous feast of guns and explosions.  \n MENTIONS FROM THE WEB\n\"Miniatures Sports Hit The Next Level With Zero Gravity Kickstarter.\" - Beasts of War\n                   \"This stunning game innovates to the point where players can enjoy an amazing experience.\" - Reviews Featured\n\"Taking board games to a whole different level, District games has developed a game set that defies the laws of gravity and fun.\"  - Gears 'n' Gadgets\n\"Gravity.

We will be using a pledge manager platform to handle this. If you are an experienced backer, you'll know that we are doing this to be fair since shipping costs vary greatly depending on your location. We will then use a fulfilment company to bring the orders to your doorstep, using the most appropriate warehouse to lower the costs and respect the environment. You can find below a list of rough estimates for shipping a standard game package (5kg volumetric weight). Although costs may rise based on weight increases from unlocked stretch goals, we promise we'll do our best to keep them down. \nWe don't promise short and impossible deadlines: we will fulfil the campaign in the time that it takes to do a perfect job and you will receive your game 6 months after the end of the campaign. The table below gives you a general idea of the schedule once the campaign ends. Keep in mind these are just estimates, and the timeline may vary.  \nBe aware that all pledges that are confirmed after the pledge manager deadline will be shipped at a later date. We also cannot ship to PO Boxes domestically or internationally (due to the size of each package there is too great a risk of the package being bounced back to us). We truly hope you will enjoy our game!  \nRETAILERS\nZero Gravity will not be available through normal distribution channels after the campaign ends. \nIf you are a retailer and are interested in receiving Zero Gravity including all the unlocked Stretch Goals, you can order multiple copies of the game during the campaign at a discounted retailer price. \nContact us at info@districtgames.it with a proof of your retailer status (VAT number, Tax ID, etc.) to receive information on discounted prices and  retailer pledge process.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our 2nd Kickstarter.

I've been creating the story at DriveComic.com, and it's entirely free to read (go try it!). And now, it's time to collect the full Act Two into a gorgeous, 256-page hardcover!\n\nDRIVE is my favorite kind of sci-fi: Hilarious characters in a serious story. A mashup of \"Hitchhiker's Guide\" and \"Dune,\" if you will.\nIt's placed in a Second Spanish Empire \u2014 a galactic empire \u2014 which finds itself staring down a war with an alien race called \"The Continuum of Makers\". Humanity has built its empire using technology stolen from the Makers, and these creatures want it back with an almost religious fervor. In the brewing war, it's clear that humanity will lose \u2014 and lose badly \u2014 unless they can find some advantage in battle. That hope arrives in the form of a tiny, mysterious creature who can drive a starship like no one's ever seen. Now all humanity needs to do...is find 10,000 more pilots just like him. But no one knows where he's from.\nThe 256-page hardcover book will be 8.5\"w x 9\"h (21.6cm x 22.8cm) and gorgeously printed! We've already unlocked TWENTY stretch goals...and as we unlock more, your hardcover gets better 'n better -- all at no extra cost to you!\nAaaand, if you didn't get Act One already -- you can get both books in this Kickstarter! \nHere's a quick guide to help you decide what rewards you'd like for backing the project!

You could add an order for the add-on in there.\nPlease note that we will add shipping fee for the add-ons (including all pledge with the add-on items). We will use pledge manager and send the survey 1 - 3 weeks after the campaign ended\nFor Megacorp Premium Item Collection, you will get megacorp music discography (4 songs) even though you didnt see it in the pledge level.\nWhat if everyone you know, loved, and remembered are just complex simulations in a computer-generated universe? What if you began to see through the shroud that separates what you think is your life from what is real? What if you wake up from this simulation, only to wonder if you are in another?\nSimulation Theory is a Boardgame for 1 to 6 players which combines elements of an escape room and a dungeon delve. The game has 3 major modes for different audiences from casual (17 minutes playtime) to hardcore (2+ hours). Simulation Theory is played with a combination of standees, cards, boards, and Dice. The dice are mainly used for tiebreakers.\nSimulation Theory was created by Mark G. Koh (Megacorp), Shawn Siow, and an international team. For the full credits, see team credits below. We put together this Kickstarter campaign because we cannot build this without you.\n\nThe base game will include 3 realities, each with 5 unique characters. The 6th character per reality will be available as a stretch goal. Each of these characters has their own strengths and weakness plus a unique backstory which has a real impact in the Ultimate mode (rules and game components will update soon)\nSeveral ways to play\nCasual mode: Easy to learn and teach, only 15 - 30 mins to play\nChallenge mode: Additional depth for experienced players, try out a special Scenario\nCompetitive mode: Much more deterministic mode of the game, with fixed treasures and it relies much more on the skill of the players than a lucky topdeck or discovery\nUltimate Mode (Stretch goal): A different way to play with branching quests for each character and deterministic gameplay. Directly integrates the story and history of the different Realities together with the gameplay\nCongratulations! You guys made it to unlocked \"Ultimate mode - Stretch goal\". In Ultimate Mode, players need to complete various quests, unique to each Character, to gain treasure and Ascend to the next Reality. Each turn, players also discover part of the story of Simulation Theory and can choose to take different actions towards one of four unique outcomes per Character.  \nThis mode will take a much longer amount of time to play than the casual or challenge mode \u2013 we estimate around 2 hours for a full game with players that are familiar with the other modes of Simulation Theory\nStretch Goal Unlocked : Ultimate Mode\nThis mode rules assume players are already familiar with the Challenge Mode and Comepetitive Mode rules an the basics of Simulation Theory are assumed here.\nSETUP \nChoose one reality. Take it's challenge deck. Find and remove the boos card, shuffle the challenge deck. Place the boss card at the center (3,3) position on the 5x5 board and fill out all the other spaces with the challenge cards face-up on the board from top to bottom, starting left to right. \nShuffle both of coordinate decks (column and row) \nTake the top card of each coordinate deck - showing a pair of coordinates - row and column. \nRandomize the purple generic tokens face down. Take a purple generic token and place it face down (without looking at it) on that position, on top of the card occupying the card at those coordinates. Do this eight times. \nEach player chooses a character from the present reality. \nSetup each player with their story tracker card on the left hand side of their character card. place the life token on \"2\" position and the book token on the \"1\" story node position for each character\n\nFIRST TURN POSITIONS \nDuring the first turn of ultimate mode, players each take their standee and choose a challenge card which is not surrounded by 4 cards orthogonically (e.g.: has a card above, below, left and right of it) - this is that player's STARTING POSITION. Each player's standee must be at least 2 spaces (horizontally or vertically) away from the next player. Two standees can be diagonally next to each other. All players must agree on their positions before the game commences. Players cannot choose a starting position with a token or standee on it.\nTURN SEQUENCE  \nThere are three parts in each turn, a planning phase, an action phase and a quest phase.\nPLANNING PHASE\nDuring the planning phase, all players act simultaneously. Each player chooses which action to perform in this phase:  \n-MOVE  \nMove the character standee into an adjacent space by specifying coordinates with the dice. The space chosen must be horizontally or vertically next to the standee. A move cannot be made into a diagonal space. Do this by placing the two dice on one of the characters traits on the board (the first to represent a row number and the second to represent a column number.) The character must have an equal or higher trait value to the challenge card in order to move onto it, otherwise they will lose one health. Can move onto challenge cards with a token or another standee (e.g.: another player) on it, if they do  \n-REST [recover life]  \nIf a player has 0 life, this is the only action they may perform The player gains 1 life and may not perform any other actions this turn. To perform a heal action. The player places his dice onto a trait of his choice but with the numbers 6/1\nACTION PHASE  \nThe action phase happens after all players are ready and reveal their dice placements. Each player who chose to move, moves their standees now. Then each player that chose the heal action, increases their health by one position. If their standee was lying down (0 health), they now place them upright.\n-INTERACT/ATTACK\nA character that lands on a challenge card with another player/character on it triggers an attack. If a character standee moves into a space with a token on it, this triggers an interaction. Interacting with a PURPLE generic token triggers a story event for that player in the QUEST PHASE -UNLOCK CHARACTER QUEST -\n-UNLOCK CHARACTER QUEST\nCharacter Quests can be unlocked when a player moves onto a card which is any one part of a 1-3 card pattern matching a quest unlock pattern that that player has. The player must declare it when it happens when they resolve during the QUEST PHASE\nQUEST PHASE During the quest phase players resolve the story items that are triggered due to the course of their actions. \nFor PURPLE TOKENS - these tokens are turned number side up. The player then refers to the ultimate mode manual pdf and will look to \"Encounter Events\" section of that reality and do the actions on encounter events.\nFor CHARACTER QUESTS: these are the quests that are unlocked and are often narratives from a character's memories/past.\nINJURY AND DEATH IN ULTIMATE MODE  \nTaking damage: Characters are dealt damage as a consequence of story events or combat. Whenever a character is dealt damage, move their health that number of positions equal the damage to the left of their life track\nASCENSION IN ULTIMATE MODE  \nAscending from the present reality in ultimate mode is the objective of each session. A player that successfully completes any combination of 7 character quests and events will asend. Failing this, the player that enters the 3/3 position after the final boss of the reality is defeated OR if the final event runs out of time (in ACT 4) will ascend.  \nTHE END OF THE GAME  \nEach session of ultimate mode is set in one reality. The players play until one player Ascends and then the session is finished and scores are taken.\nSCORING IN ULTIMATE MODE  At the end end of each session, each player counts the the following as their score\n1. ascension tokens - the player that ascends receives the gold ascension token and has 20 VP  \n2. treasure - the face value of each treasure card collected counts as VP\n3. Quests - each quest card has a VP value\n4. EVENTS -each major events card has a VP value\n5. HEALTH - every point of health a player has at the end of the session converts to 1VP\n6. Trait tokens - take the total number of positive trait tokens minus the number of negative trait tokens a character has, this converts to VP \nRETAINING SCORE\nEach player should record down their scores for an ultimate mode session. The scores should be cumulative into the next session. Until all available realities are completed, the final winner is the player with the highest total score of all sessions\nBasic Gameplay: Casual Mode\nThis describes fundamental core mechanics only: the game has much more to offer in two other modes\nSimultaneous Turns\n\nPlanning Phase: Secretly select which card to hit, and which trait to use\nEveryone simultaneously reveals their plan\n Action Phase: Compare your stats to the card\nMiss - Leave the card face up for later\nWin - Gain a treasure!\nLose - Skip the next turn, or discard a treasure\n\nPlan well and you could encounter rival players in the same location to help or hinder.\nAscend through the three Realities\nDefeat the boss or find the Exit and wake up in a new Reality. Gain a new Character to face new challenges, or return to your previous Reality with Godlike power.\nAscending\nGain a new character\nFill board with new reality challenge cards\nGames End\nThe game ends after someone ascends from the third Reality\nAdvanced gameplay : Competitive mode\nDownload and try the free print and play here.\nTry Simulation Theory on Tabletop simulator here.\nNote: The game pieces in both the print and play and the tabletop simulator only have rudimentary art instead of the illustrations used for the final production version.\nExplore three different realities. Which one is real? Who knows\nThe Stone  \nLegend has it that millennia ago, a star fell from the heavens crashed into the world of Gaeus. It is said that this stone is imbued with such vast power that anyone that touches the stone would perish. Other stories claim that instead of dying from its touch, someone worthy would be able to wield its Godlike power. The stone was thought to be lost but has been rediscovered when a mighty quake cracked the earth asunder, revealing the ancient temple that was built around it. As it is, the primacy of the 8 God Kings is threatened by a warlord immune to their magic, who is also amassing a tremendous horde. Heroes have experienced fevered dreams, brought about by the stone calling to them.\nYou are one such stoneseeker. You awake disoriented, having lived some other life in a place where magic does not exist and the God-kings do not rule.\nThe land of Teres, where the stone fell, is now a hotbed of political intrigue, with adventurers and royals alike gambling their lives on reaching the stone first. And through it all, a horrid otherworldly blight twists all life it touches as it spreads unchecked. Will the stone grant you the power to fulfill your wishes?\nThe Prison  \nYou awake, wearing a prison jumpsuit and strapped to a Virtual Reality machine. You are deep in the bowels of a black site that officially does not exist; Level 44.\nThe prison is the infamous Simbulan Penitentiary, located in the city of San Miguel. The prison is privately owned and staffed by sadistic ex-criminal guards and robotic EXA units.\nBut you are not in any normal cell. The machine you were connected to moments ago should induce Virtual Enhanced Interrogation. The technology is so advanced that the life you just experienced feels more real than the shithole you are now trapped in. None of this is even remotely legal, even by the corrupt standards of San Miguel.\nSuddenly the locks on your cell open as a prison riot rages throughout the facility. The supermax inmates have spilled over into the black site, taking over section by section in a murderous rage. Is it too late to escape? Is it too late for answers?\nThe Ark  \nAfter the near-apocalyptic singularity event on Earth, the newly risen AI's left behind a seemingly benevolent member of their kind, GENECIA. Her intervention veered humanity away from the brink of extinction, by providing them the gift of viable long-distance space travel. A part of that gift is the designs of the Genisis Ark. Like millions of others, you are on one such Ark. Yours is headed toward P4-11, a habitable planet.\nYou awake in a cryo-pod as one of the privileged few who went on this journey to a new home with their entire body intact. Less important colonists only had their brains transported, awaiting their bodies to be reconstructed when the new world is settled.\nThe Ark has virtual reality programs to keep the minds of those in stasis active. Your VR sim was strange, almost entirely too real. That, and you were woken too soon. Alarms are blaring, the life support system seems to have been damaged. The ship's AI is mysteriously absent. Where is the captain? Can you save the mission? Can you save yourself?\n\nDesigner note: We didn't just 'tack on some lore' for our game - we take storytelling very seriously.

Learn the basics here. \n\nThis is a simple 1v1 playthrough in casual mode in a hotel room\nRemember that all our playthrough videos use rudimentary placeholder art. Please do not judge the components by what you see here. The standees and the main board components are not shown.\nThe purpose of these videos is to demonstrate the core mechanics and craftsmanship of STG's game design. The two other game modes (challenge/adventure) build on the knowledge from playing casual mode at least once.\n Challenge mode utilizes the basic rule framework of the game to deliver almost infinite replayability with Challenge scenarios (you can try the ones below with the print and play!). Believe us, it is almost like designing an entirely new game each time.\n\"Arkfall\" - 4 Players - Stone Reality Scenario\n                                                                                                        \"Decontamination Protocol\" - 3 players - Prison Reality Scenario\nCompetitive mode is a much more deterministic mode of the game, with fixed treasures and it relies much more on the skill of the players than a lucky topdeck or discovery. The challenge cards are dealt face up in a 5x5 grid, with the boss card at its center. Ascensions move the boss.\nPlaythrough video of Competitive mode in Singapore\nWhat Others Says About Simulation Theory Game\nIGN Post-launch (SEA)\nIGN Pre-launch (SEA)\nGames Hub (Malaysia)\nTantrum House - on 37:50 mark in the podcast (USA)\nGame It (Spain)\nDAGeeks (Philippines)\nBoard Game Geek (USA)\nMany thanks to Lytt Labs for manufacturing the official STG watch!

That is why I agreed to get on board and help with the writing. I am going to speak candidly here and say that once I got here things were a little helter-skelter, to say the least; and Mark K\u2019s requests were on the ambitious side. That said, it was a great opportunity to present a little something of myself to share with all of you and I hope you all will feel it fun to experience. Some details. The stone reality and ark reality has been written and is currently being conformed into the Ultimate Mode (Scenario) format. Stone abilities are done, with the prison and ark realities being playtested and worked on. Everything\u2019s permitted and nothing is forbidden... In the Ultimate Mode, I have taken the creative license to divert from the Megacorp canon of the realities. Stone, prison and ark. My reason for doing so is to provide a more streamlined experience where the focus is on the Ultimate Mode\u2019s story and gameplay. For example, in the Stone Reality, we follow in the steps of one of the \u2018Paladin\u2019. Players may take turns playing this character or each player may have their own characters throughout the reality. In Ultimate Mode you will use treasures to purchase abilities and customise your characters as you best befitting your play style. Now, imagine the ultimate mode as a play. There will be an Active, Inactive and Required character. Active characters are named characters in the current quest, while inactive characters are characters who have the abilities of the class (prince, wizard, etc) but are not actively participating as a named character.

There is exploration, trade, investigation, space combat, science projects, infiltration, and troubleshooting. We play to find out how the crew gets the job done, the choices they make, the rules they break, and the lengths they will go for their patrons.\nA Free Spacer contingency type corvette recently folded into a system around the core.\nFeatures\nFree Spacer is a roleplaying game with distinct features for science fiction roleplaying, inspired by Cowboy Bebop, Dark Matter, Farscape, Firefly, Killjoys, Switchblade Honey, or the works of Heinlein.\nTrue Sci-fi// At its core, the game has a theme of freedom vs. power in a depiction a future far from now, rather than a retro sci-fi. It is contemporary science fiction that leverages the newest space sciences, takes into account biotechnology, and brings the internet to the rim of the quadrant.  \nCustom Starship// You play the crew of a starship. The ship acts a template for your crew and the type of contracts you take. Together you operate the starship, each taking a ship station.\nSandbox play// Space is big; a vast sandbox of unlimited freedom. Free Spacer provides a series of streamlined and efficient tools to the Gamemaster to prepare locations and characters. These are not just empty places and stat blocks, rather each includes their agenda and faction relationship.\nCold War Phase// The Cold War phase is a faction turn that lets you, the Gamemaster, simulate the faction struggle to control the sector. The phase generates your sector background and gives you prompts to create contracts.\nContract is law// You're a contractor, you live and die by your contract. Like the law, you may break the terms of your contract, but there is a price. The crew negotiates contracts to earn Residual Value \u2013 the value of Cargo, which acts as the in-game experience points.\nProcedural Sector// From the Sector and the great societies at the core of civilisation down to settlements and creatures, Free Spacer has tool to procedurally generate everything. Sit down and build out your own detailed setting or just what you need. Every world, system, and factions will be your own, all while emphasising a real sci-fi galaxy.\nFree Spacers battle their way along the hull of a capital ship\n  Game Mechanics\nFree Spacer uses a unique set of core mechanics designed for science fiction. The system is streamlined, but with crunch that emphasises science and technology. The players roll all the dice and have plenty of knobs to turn.\nTasks// Players roll a pool of ten-sided dice, which represent their crewmember\u2019s skills, specialties, and resources. You roll these task dice against a pool of six-sided dice that represents the task's difficulty.\nResource Management// During play, you have a variety of resources to manage that bestow useful benefits in play. You can spend charge to increase your chance to succeed, trade cargo to earn profit, spend Supply to power gear, and spend Complex Materials to maintain or advance your crewmember, ship, and gear.\nProjects// The game has a set of advanced mechanics known as projects. Projects use the core mechanic, but multiple tasks work together to complete them.\nFree Spacer has been in development for several years and the entire book\u2014rules, setting, GM prep, and game sheets\u2014has extensively playtested in multiple versions. Free Spacer is finally ready for you. To get it into your hands, I need your backing. Your pledges will be used to bring the best possible version of Free Spacer into existence.\nEditing// With the game text complete, I\u2019ve brought in Karen Twelves as the editor. She\u2019s finished her first edit and the book is ready for further editing, indexing, and final tweaks. The Kickstarter will enable Karen to shepherd Free Spacer book to its completion. \nIf we fund, she\u2019ll complete the edit of the revised manuscript in multiple passes and we\u2019ll also hire a proofreader and indexer.\nArt// The art of Free Spacer reflects contemporary science fiction. It is a complex future with multiple elements, like holograms, branding, technology, the internet, the frontier, and space. As the Art Director, Lisa Sapinsky is responsible for all the art throughout the book. She has made a good deal of the art in 3D. She\u2019s using Modo, Substance, and UnReal for the final rendering. She has already commissioned other illustrations, like those you see on this page from John Love and Rocco Commission original Free Spacer Logo. The art promises to be contemporary and beautiful.\nIf the game funds, Lisa will be able to complete the art for the book. That means more of everything. More aliens, creature, and starships in 3D environments. She\u2019ll also add art of your gear, the crew kit that makes you a veteran Free Spacer. Likewise, she\u2019ll add more silhouettes art and in-setting 2D art. On top of the interior art, we are exploring a lot of different cover concepts from the minimal to the complex. To push this to the next level, I have three awesome art stretch goals.\nA Free Spacer contingency type corvette vectors towards orbit of terrestrial giant\nLayout// Amongst my many hats, I enjoy layout art. I\u2019ve already laid out the many play sheets for the game and am making headway with layout tests of the full the book in Adobe InDesign. I am laying out the book as a 6x9 digest with a clean easy-to-read style that directly addresses you as the player or gamemaster. \nIf the game funds, I\u2019ll be finishing a full layout of the book with full hyperlinking.\nActual Play// You may have played a version of Free Spacer at GenCon, GoPlay NW, PAX West, TCTC, Fear the Con, Fan Expo Canada, or Roll20 Con. I have been also running actual plays on Twitch and posting them to YouTube. Even better, Eric Vulgaris has just started to run their own Actual Play series on Thursdays, check is out on their Twitch and YouTube.\nFulfillment// We will do fulfillment through Indie Press Revolution, who will also be handling the post Kickstarter distribution. We are currently looking into other fulfillment services for locations outside the US.\nShipping// We will charge for shipping once the campaign is over using the Backerkit Surveys. Shipping rates will likely change before the games are ready to ship. Please keep this in mind as you pledge.\nRoll20 Support// The game already has ship and crew sheets on Roll20 that you can try out right now. \nIf it funds, the sheets will be upgraded to include Gamemaster character sheets and use the compendium and new charactermancer. Likewise, I want to add more functionality to the sheets to make Roll20 the easiest way to play Free Spacer.\nFree Spacers dealing with an onboard emergency\nHere\u2019s what it is all about! Your reward for supporting this project. Beyond my everlasting thanks, you will get the first copies of Free Spacer and become forever part of the game.\nPreview PDF// As a backer of Free Spacer, you'll get access to the early preview PDF before the Kickstarter campaign concludes. This preview includes all the text and tables with Karen\u2019s first edit. The preview won\u2019t have art, an index, or any extras\u2014just a straightforward layout.\nFree Spacer PDF// As backer of the #drifter level or greater, you\u2019ll receive a copy of the final book as a PDF at the conclusion of the Kickstarter. The final version will be complete with the same text and art as the physical copies of the book. The PDF will be hyperlinked and bookmarked for easy use.\nSector Archive// At the #dataflow level and above you\u2019ll receive a PDF version of the Sector Archives. The Sector Archives is a booklet of pre-prepared setting and campaign materials. It has everything you need to start your campaign with little additional prep. The archives include setting materials and one or more beginning contracts, plus, all the locations and characters you need to run those scenarios. The Sector Archive includes a flexible setting for any sort of play and one based on Eric Vulgaris\u2019 streaming actual play. Stretch goals will add more settings by game talented designers.\nSoftcover book// Those backing at #crewmember level receive a layflat 6x9 softcover book. We\u2019ll be designing the cover art during the campaign and looking to you for feedback. \nHardcover book// Those backing at #veteran, #captain, and #gamemaster level receive a lay flat 6x9 hardcover book. We\u2019ll be putting the cover art together during the campaign and be looking to those that pledge at these levels for feedback. \nPrinted Sector Archive// At the #gamemaster and #captain levels you receive a printed booklet of all the setting information for each Sector Archive to present to your players.\nBe an Example Player// Five awesome backers will become part of Free Spacer. At the #captain level, your name, pronouns, and in-game choices will be immortalised as the example group throughout the text. Every reader will see your name as they learn to play the game.\nAlthough Free Spacer will be a complete Roleplaying game, I want to push it further and make it even better. I have devised two types of stretch goals, those that enhance the book and those that add resources for your game. I hope you will help me get enough people onboard that we can make some of this cool stuff.  \nFree Spacer crew greeting strange new alien sophonts\n[Unlocked] Social Media Pirates\nOnly by promoting the Free Spacer Kickstarter can you free my dangerous pirate supplement. This will be an oppressive setting that puts your faction on the wrong side of every local law. You\u2019re the villains that threaten to tear it all down.\nHow it works// Help promote the game and we\u2019ll add points to a reserve. Once it reaches 2018, we\u2019ll unlock the stretch goal and it will be added to the Sector Archive. \nPromote the game in any of these ways to add points to the Reserve:\n1 point: Join the Free Spacer Facebook group \n1 point: Like the Free Spacer Facebook page  \n1 point: Join the Free Spacer G+ Community \n1 point: Follow the me on Twitter: http://twitter.com/XophRA  \n1 point: Tweet the Kickstarter link with #FreeSpacer \n100 points: If you post a link on any of the above sites to a blog post promoting the Kickstarter, reviewing the preview, or hosting a picture of your group playing Free Spacer.\n200 points: If you run a podcast or stream, schedule an interview with me, and post it before the end of the Kickstarter.\n[Unlocked] $20,000 CAD - Offset Print\nThe game will be printed as a 320 to 400 page 6\"x9\" digest style book in soft and hardcover. We will do an offset print run through Friesens in Manitoba Canada. Friesens is an employee owned premier short run printer founded in 1907 as a family company. I have had a relationship with Friesens since 2009 and I believe I\u2019ll get a beautiful print. Likewise, it was important for us to print locally with a Canadian printer.\nThe Secor Archive will be printed using Lulu or smaller local printer due to the small number of copies. \n[Unlocked] $21,000 CAD - Technician Sector Archive by Kira Magrann\nWhen this stretch goal is unlocked, Kira Magrann will write a Sector Archive for crews that fly the Technician flag. The Papiliocene Sector is well known for its radical advances in technology. Their need for funding and subsequent corrupt practices has led to corporate espionage, worker exploration, and strange new technology that doesn't care much for sentient flesh. The systems here flourish by exporting tech to other systems, but not without cost to the inhabitants under their corporate rule.\nKira is a tabletop roleplaying game designer, queer cyborg, and snake mom living in Columbus, Ohio. She currently has a Patreon where she designs experimental games, a YouTube channel where she talks about game design, and she blogs a few times a month at Gnome Stew. With the support of her patrons she recently released a game about Lesbisnakes in wintertime titled A Cozy Den. You can find all her work at her website.  \n[Unlocked] $21,500 CAD - Scout Sector Archive by Johnstone Metzger\nAfter this stretch goal is unlocked, Johnstone will write a Sector Archive for crews that fly the Scout flag.

The game is complete, the mechanics are final and have been playtested thoroughly. It is a working playable roleplaying game. It has been fully written and is undergoing minor tweaks and revisions for clarity and simplicity. It is in the editing and art phase pre-layout. There is a risk with me doing the layout, but I have several layout artists in the wings that could come to the rescue. \n\nThe Sector Archive relies on work from other designers, all of which have experience delivering Kickstarter stretch goals, self publishing, and even successfully completing their own Kickstarters. \n\nFriesens has a long history of printing quality work, but there could also be some delays, but these should be minor.\n\nShipping can always be problematic, which is why we'll be using Backerkit and/or, if we print a offset run, Indie Press Revolution to deal with fulfillment.

It has never been published and almost disappeared from history after the war, but we are now restoring the pages of one of the most important documents of WW2. \nThe original 112 pages contained thorough information about everything from tidal forces to typical battle tactics and had the absolute highest security stamp during WW2: Top Secret Bigot - above Top Secret.\nIt described the German defenses and typical strongpoints, the risk of chemical attacks and was so thorough it even had an analysis of the soil type on Utah and Omaha Beach.\nThe book will contain a one-to-one copy of the original Monograph, new historical context and rare photos to explore. \nin total app 250 pages in hardcover including the original Monograph, added historical context and rare photos.\nWe will restore every single page from 1944 to its original look as it was presented in the Neptune Monograph. \nThe original Monograph will run on the right page throughout the book. Here you get a rare insight into the depth of the incredible intelligence work and literally cast your eyes on the same pages, that the allied command got in their hand for the first time six weeks before D-Day.\nOriginally the left pages were blank. Here commanders could add their notes and latest updates. We have decided to use this space to give a deeper understanding of the Monograph and add historical context and rare photos on the left pages of the book to explore and get the full picture of how the information was collected.\nThe Neptune Monograph was split into nine sections giving a deep and rare insight into the situation in Normandy six weeks before D-Day. All nine chapters will be in the book. \nThe Monograph has more than 14 pages of charts, maps, and graphics showing predicted German troop movements, tidal charts, and graphics of the layout of typical German strongpoints in Normandy as well as charts of the naval threat from warships and mines. The maps, charts, and folios will be restored and be in the book in full color.\nStretch goals are set up to allow us to expand the book into a package complete with full-size maps and a very rare addendum. This is quite expensive, but we would love to add it to the Neptune Monograph (see below for more information about our stretch goals, and how you can help expand the scope of the project).\nHenrik Elling has worked for more than 15 years teaching history and as an Editor in Chief at Scandinavia's best selling history- and science magazines.

Corey\u2019s award-winning series of science fiction novels to the tabletop. Using the Adventure Game Engine (AGE) rules found in Fantasy AGE, Blue Rose, and Modern AGE, The Expanse takes players to a far-future solar system where humanity is divided: Martians, Belters, and the people of old Earth struggle for political power and resources, but even older, alien, forces are stirring in the universe, and human history is about to take an unexpected new turn. The Expanse applies the fast-playing and action-based AGE rules to spaceships, solar colonies, and adventure and intrigue in the far-future, where the actions of the characters may change the course of history!\nAs long time fans know, The Expanse was a roleplaying game campaign long before it was a series of novels or a TV show. We are delighted to bring it full circle with this game! And here's the best thing about The Expanse RPG: we've been working on this for well over a year and rules are done! They've been through multiple iterations and playtesting, and we've worked closely with Ty Franck and Daniel Abraham (together, James S.A. Corey) throughout to ensure we are getting The Expanse right. Now let's hear from Daniel and Ty themselves!\nPLAY\n\nWant to check the game out RIGHT NOW? Download The Expanse RPG Quickstart today! This is a 40-page PDF that includes stripped down rules, pre-generated characters, and an adventure you can play right away. The download is free. \nThe Expanse RPG Features \nThe Expanse is based on the exciting new Modern AGE rules-set, and includes many of its features, such as customized character building using Backgrounds and Professions, Drives for character engagement, and an abstract resources system. It also makes use of the Modern AGE approach to action, exploration, and social encounters, complete with stunts and systems for all of them. To get a closer look at Modern AGE, you can download the Quickstart here.   \nThe following are some of the unique features of The Expanse in comparison to other AGE games:  \nFortune: Rather than Health, characters have a Fortune score that measures lucky near-misses, close scrapes, and trivial hits before the character takes serious harm. Fortune is also useful for modifying die rolls and offering players some narrative control but, watch out! Spend too much of it and your luck could run out when you get caught in a crossfire!\nConditions: In addition to a running Fortune total, characters use various conditions to measure things like injuries and fatigue as well as tactical challenges like hindered movement or sensory abilities.  \nInterludes: The interludes in between encounters are given their own treatment, allowing players to make use of their \u201cdown-time\u201d (including long hauls between destinations in the System) to recover, do maintenance, build their connections with others, or pursue their own projects.  \nSpaceships: The Expanse RPG features a system to model and create spaceships and its own system for space combat, including the assault on Thoth Station as an example of the system in action!  \nThe Churn: The Expanse also offers something for the Game Master with the Churn: A ticking counter that measures the crew\u2019s progress through a story and just when things are going to suddenly go sideways and become even more complicated!\nTwo Editions to Choose From!\nWe are offering the core rulebook of the Expanse RPG in two formats:\nThe Standard Edition is now (thanks to unlocked stretch goals) a 224 page full color hardback with a poster map of the solar system. This is the version that will stay in print after the Kickstarter has been fulfilled. \nThe Special Edition is a deluxe version of The Expanse RPG. It features the same beautiful full color interior of the Standard Edition with a black leatherette hardcover and a ribbon bookmark. This version is a Kickstarter exclusive, so it will not be available after the close of this campaign. Thanks to an unlocked stretch goal, the Special Edition now includes a dust jacket featuring the game's gorgeous cover art!\nThe Expanse Game Master's Kit\nThis Kickstarter also includes The Expanse Game Master's Kit, which will ship alongside the book. It currently includes the following, but may expand with the unlocking of stretch goals:\nA three-panel landscape format GM Screen with vital game system reference tables on one side and three panels of Expanse art on the player-facing side.  \nA set of game reference cards, including an initiative tracker, stunt references, and action references useful for players at the table.\nNow includes pre-generated characters after a stretch goal unlock!\nNow includes an adventure after a stretch goal unlock!\nAbzu's Bounty\nAbzu's Bounty is the first campaign for The Expanse  Roleplaying Game. This series of six linked scenarios will let you kick off your adventures in The Expanse in style. All six parts were unlocked as stretch goals so the full campaign is a go! Best of all, if you back the Kickstarter for $30 or more, you get a PDF of Abzu's Bounty for free! \n\nDesign Team\nWe assembled a great team to design The Expanse Roleplaying Game. Steve Kenson is the lead designer. You may know Steve from our Blue Rose and Mutants & Masterminds RPGs, or from any of the dozens of RPG books he's worked on over the last two decades. He had the able assistance of Seth Johnson, Ian Lemke, Rich Lescouflair, Rob McCreary, Jason Mical, Neall Raemonn Price, Zack Walters, Nicole Winchester, and of course James S.A. Corey!\n\nImportant Note: Shipping!  \nWe are going to be charging shipping separately later this year when the books are almost ready, and it will be EU-, Canada-, and Australia-friendly. In our previous Kickstarters, we tried to keep it simple with just a few standard shipping costs but this has proved a poor way to handle it. International shipping can be brutal and in too many cases we were paying more to ship than we collected for it. Shipping rates can also rise after a campaign ends but before the games are ready to ship. So about a month from shipping, we will assess and collect actual shipping costs using a pledge manager. The upside is that you don\u2019t need to pay the full cost now. We also want to point out that The Expanse RPG Standard Edition will be sold through distribution and into game and book stores after backers get their books. If you are concerned that shipping is going to be too expensive, be aware that the Kickstarter will not be the only way you can get the game. If you can get it from your local game store and save yourself a lot on shipping, that\u2019s a totally reasonable decision to make. There are also special tiers of the Kickstarter for retailers, so you can also talk to your local store and find out if they'll be bringing in books that way.\nGamers and retailers may also be interested in our Pre-Order Plus Program. Basically, this lets gamers pre-order our games through their local stores and get the same special we offer on our website. You can find out more about Pre-Order Plus here. \nStretch Goals\nOur initial batch of stretch goals are focused on enhancing the core rulebook and GM's Kit, make them bigger and better. \nUnlocked!

For continuing updates on Call to Adventure, visit BrotherwiseGames.com and our Facebook page!\nCall to Adventure is a tabletop game in which players compete to craft the hero with the greatest destiny. Play cards to build your character, cast runes to face challenges, and choose whether to follow a path of heroism or villainy. The core game mode is a 2-4 player competitive game, but Call to Adventure can also be played solo or cooperatively!\nCall to Adventure was created by Brotherwise Games, designers of the hit game Boss Monster. Our goal: design a game based on character-driven fantasy novels and RPGs. In Call to Adventure, facing a childhood rival or meeting your true love can be as important as slaying a dragon.\nAnd as part of this Kickstarter, we're thrilled to announce collaborations with two New York Times bestselling authors, Patrick Rothfuss and Brandon Sanderson. The very first expansion to the game -- available as a pledge level within this campaign -- will be set in the world of Rothfuss's The Name of the Wind. When this campaign reached $300,000 in funding, Brandon Sanderson announced that next year we will be releasing Call to Adventure: Stormlight.\nWhether you play in these fantasy worlds or create your own, Call to Adventure is a chance to create your own epic journey.\nChoose your path. Cast the runes. Achieve your destiny. Heed the...\nThe base game contains everything that 1-4 players need for unlimited hero crafting fun. Please note that the numbers above include all stretch goals unlocked over the course of the campaign (with the exception of the Kingkiller-exclusive \"Path of the Adem\" stretch goal). Higher pledge levels bring meaningful improvements to your game:\nPlease note that there will be no pledge manager for this campaign, but in some countries we can support Add-Ons through Kickstarter. Scroll to the bottom of this page for more information on Add-Ons.\nThe default \"world\" of Call to Adventure is classic fantasy, inspired by traditional tropes of sword-and-sorcery storytelling. But as huge fans of fantasy fiction, we dreamed of bringing Call to Adventure to established fantasy settings.\nBrotherwise Games is thrilled to announce that our first expansion will be set in the world of Patrick Rothfuss's best-selling Kingkiller Chronicles series. This expansion, and others to follow, will add new Challenges, new Destinies, and unique mechanics unique to the author's world.\nThe Name of the Wind and The Wise Man's Fear are two of the most critically-acclaimed fantasy novels ever written, and we couldn't be more excited to bring their characters and themes to this expansion. Fans of the books will love this expansion, but anyone can enjoy it. Most of the cards feature Heroic Fantasy themes that can be brought into any fantasy world. And by backing this Kickstarter, you get the exclusive \"Path of the Adem\" Origin, Motivation, and Destiny cards!\nCall to Adventure is a game about choices. Do you begin as a Peasant or a Noble? Do you train your Strength or seek out Wisdom? Do you follow the path of a Hero or Antihero? Will your backstory ultimately be tragic or triumphant?\nOn every step of your hero's journey, you'll have to choose between immediate rewards and long-term potential. Do you push your luck and face a daunting Challenge now, or build your Abilities until you're truly ready?\nIt all starts with the first cards you'll see in the game: your Origin, Motivation, and Destiny:\nEach player is dealt two of each card type, giving you the chance to begin crafting your hero right away. The three cards you choose become your hero's Story, and most other cards you gain will be tucked under these initial Story cards. By the end of the game, after your hero has faced a host of challenges, your Story could look something like this:\nUnlike a standard die-roller, Call to Adventure relies on Runes to see if the fates are smiling on your efforts. The three core runes can be used for all challenges. You can also add any relevant Ability runes you've gained, and can choose whether to risk Corruption by casting dark runes.\nEvery icon visible in your Story is important. They reflect your heroic capabilities and contribute to your final Destiny score:\nEvery turn, you may attempt to add one card to your Story. For example, to gain a Trait, you must simply meet its prerequisite:\nChallenges, on the other hand, require you to push your luck and cast the runes to see if you succeed. Challenges are also another example of Call to Adventure's emphasis on choices. Every Challenge has two \"paths.\" The path you choose determines the reward you gain if you're successful.\nThe game doesn't end there! Hero cards can help you on the path to glory, while Antihero cards can make the most of an angst-ridden path. Experience tokens, gained when you fail a Challenge, can be spent to fuel card abilities. Engine building, set collection, and cross-table play are all part of the Call to Adventure experience!\nFor more on the game itself, we have posted a gameplay video. You can also download the rulebook or watch this How to Play video from The Rules Girl:\nThis campaign has unlocked every one of its stretch goals! With over 50 cards, two new play modes, and multiple component upgrades, this campaign has succeeded in seriously enhancing your Call to Adventure experience. Every stretch goal is available at the base game pledge level (and already included in the card counts above), with the exception of the \"Path of the Adem\" (which will be shipped with the Name of the Wind expansion early next year).\nAdd-Ons are only available to backers in the US, EU, Canada, and Australia. If you wish to Add On one of the items above, please increase your pledge by that amount, and then specify your desired item in the post-campaign Kickstarter survey. Backers in the EU, Canada and Australia should add an addition $5 per item in shipping costs when calculating Add-Ons.\nBrotherwise is partnering with Kickstarter veterans, Quartermaster Logistics, to make U.S. and international fulfillment as affordable and effective as possible for all our backers.\nU.S. domestic shipping is included in your pledge, and the same amount subsidized for International shipping charges. Thanks to Quartermaster's worldwide fulfillment network, we'll be offering Canada, Europe, and Australia-friendly shipping, so that your costs are considerably reduced and VAT costs are covered.\nThe table below details your additional international shipping costs:\nRetailer Pledge Level\nGame and hobby retailers have been the heart of Brotherwise\u2019s success as a small publisher. With the goal of continuing that productive partnership, Brotherwise provides a retailer pledge option for brick and mortar game store owners excited to carry Call to Adventure. Terms are as follows: \nYou must be a brick-and-mortar retailer with a shipping address in the US, Canada, the EU, or Australia. It is okay if your store is outside those regions as long as you have a freight forwarder or similar service with an address within one of those regions. If you have a question as to whether or not you qualify, please contact us at bwisegames@gmail.com. \nYou may only purchase one complete carton of 5 base games. Because of the more distant launch date, The Name of the Wind expansion is not available for the retailer pledge, nor are the playmat or sleeves. However, all stretch goals will be included with your 5 copies of the game. \nThe pledge level amount is set at 50% of MSRP. Brotherwise will cover all shipping.

One team, the villains, are trying to take over the world with their their doomsday devices. The other team, the spies, are infiltrating the villains' secret lair to stop them. The spies must use their stealth and cunning to shut the villains down without getting caught. The villains must use their deductive reasoning and massive stockpile of weapons to prevent the spies' subversion. 2-4 players, ages 10+, 60-90 minutes\nCompletely asymmetric - each team plays completely differently. Will you be sneaky or discerning, cunning or explosive!?\nWork as a team - You won't make it far on your own. Players must coordinate with their teammate if they hope to be successful.\nHidden movement - Both sides move in secret, making the spies harder to hit, but they never know when a flamethrower is just around the next corner\nStrategic gameplay - Through the unique programming mechanics of the game, both teams must prioritize when to bunker down and expand their abilities, and when to sprint out and hope for a victory.\nMultiple powers to explore - Each character has multiple abilities to unlock, making every game a completely unique experience\nSet in the Burgle Bros universe - Some of your favorite safecrackers have been called in to save the world.\nNote from the Designer, Tim Fowers:  Sabotage is not for everyone. Unlike my past games, Sabotage is a head-to-head battle with a high learning curve. It has been a passion project for a long time - trying to capture the sublime gameplay of \"Spies vs Mercs\" mode of Splinter Cell, but in a boardgame. It is tricky at first, because of the unique mix of mechanics, but it's not too heavy after a game or two (my kids play with me).  I strongly encourage players to try the intro game, before unlocking all the gadgets (available free as intro Print and Play here). Sabotage has layers of delicious mind games that dedicated players will discover as they master the tools the game provides.\nSabotage is a tense and strategic cat-and-mouse game for two teams. Each team has their own copy of the 4x4 grid map, separated by a divider. Four dice are rolled each round, and all players program their moves simultaneously by spending those dice.\nThe Villains execute their programmed moves first, followed by the Spies. When Spies take a move action, they must announce some information about their location to the Villains. They use this to deduce and track the Spies. Both sides have the ability to unlock new tools and get access to more dice each round.\nThe Spies are trying to hack 8 times before the Villains hit them 5 times with their weapons.\nFor a brief overview, watch the video below:\nHere is video of how to play with the advance abilities.\n Each round, one player rolls the dice, and all players copy those numbers.\n Then everyone programs their actions using 2 of the 4 dice.\n Each time Spies move, they have to reveal one piece of information.\nFor a more complete understanding of the rules, check out the rulebook here.\nHere is an advanced game playthrough:\nSabotage brings back some of your favorite Burgle Bros characters - but with a whole new look!\nWe are also introducing a new cast of evil villains to go toe-to-toe with the Burgle team, all illustrated by Ryan Goldsberry.\n                                                                                                                           For this project we're not making stretch goals.  We have a bunch of timed unlocks coming every few days that will make the game even better.  Also there are no kickstarter exclusives or expansions.  No shenanigans.  This is just the lowest price there will be for the game. It will not be in distribution, but will be at some retailers.\nHow are we making it even better? The first Fowers game with miniatures:\nThe game will include miniatures of all the characters.  And because of the divider, both teams need a copy of each mini, so we're making a second set.\nDon't have four players?  We also have a mobile app that you can play against!  Grab a friend and go up against some computer controlled villains.  Your side plays just like the normal game with the board, cards, etc.  All you do is input what you would normally announce to the other team.  It also will generate new maps each game.\nABOUT THE CREATORS\nTim Fowers is the designer of many successful games including Burgle Bros, Fugitive, Paperback, and more. He is excited to be teaming up with Jeff Krause, the programmer responsible for the Burgle Bros and Hardback apps, along with Ryan Goldsberry, the illustrator behind all of Tim's games.\nWHY PLEDGE NOW\nHelp guide the development of this game. We listen to our backers and strive to implement their clever ideas.\nBackers receive the game at a discount compared to after the campaign.\nThis game is not going to distributors.

Her first and most prominent work, Color Problems: A Practical Manual for the Lay Student of Color, first published in 1901, provides a comprehensive overview of the main ideas of color theory at the time, as well as her wildly original and artistic approaches to color analysis and interaction. Through a 21st century lens, she appears to stumble upon midcentury design and minimalism decades prior to those movements. \nShe was a visionary color theorist whose methods were later adopted by men and became ubiquitous in design curriculums around the world. She was an incredible artist and creative champion whose pioneering work is conspicuously absent in nearly all history books. We aim to change that with this new presentation of her seminal work. In addition to presenting the original book in an accessible softcover, we are offering a beautifully bound hardcover edition exclusive to this Kickstarter campaign. This deluxe facsimile version will not be made available again.\nEmily Noyes Vanderpoel at home (courtesy Litchfield Historical Society)\nHer remarkable inventiveness shines in a series of gridded squares, each 10 x 10, that analyze the proportions of color derived from actual objects, many of which were in Vanderpoel's vast collection of ceramics and antiques. She leaves her process relatively mysterious but what is clear, as historian and science blogger John Ptak\u202fnotes, is that Vanderpoel \u201csought not so much to analyze the components of color itself, but rather to quantify the overall interpretative effect of color on the imagination\u201d. Her square format predates Josef Albers\u2019\u202ficonic Homage to the Square\u202fby some fifty years.\nA Selection of Color Analysis Plates\nThis incredible book has long languished in antiquarian book markets.  Original copies trade hands for more than $500 and it has never received its proper audience. \u202fWe aim to change that, and with this new edition have taken meticulous measures to reproduce the original artifact at an affordable price. Largely disserved by the public domain, this vast 400 page book has been reproduced in recent years by shoddy print-on-demand services, from academically held PDFs and most tragically, only in black and white. Working with the Historical Society that Emily Noyes Vanderpoel helped establish, we are the first to invest the time, money, and love it takes to replicate this brilliant collection of color studies accurately. Using the most current digital methods and archival printing production, we aim to finally do justice to Vanderpoel\u2019s forgotten legacy as visionary and pioneer.\nWe will also be contributing an introduction written by design scholar Alan P. Bruton, who has been researching Vanderpoel and her work for decades. This introduction will serve to reflect on her incredible body of work from the vantage point of 21st century art history and women's movements, helping to illustrate that Vanderpoel remains one of the most important, underrated, and contemporarily relevant artists of her time and of the last century.\n\"Thoroughly conversant with the best scientific research of her day, Emily Noyes Vanderpoel brings an artist\u2019s eye and designer\u2019s sensibility to her prescient study of color. From embroidery and Persian rugs to ceramics and painting, her perceptive analysis reveals what was long hiding in plain sight. The remarkable illustrations are actually works of art that not only anticipate but actually compete with the best work of some of the most important twentieth-century artists.\"\nMark C. Taylor\nColumbia University\n\"Vanderpoel\u2019s delightfully inscrutable work is an artifact from out of time: abstract modernism born of the Victorian need to classify everything\u2014even the mundane. This book inspired me, and deserves this beautiful new treatment in print.\"\nLiza Daly  Author and creator of the Vanderbot \n\"This re-edition of Emily Noyes Vanderpoel's 1901 Color Problems is a fantastic addition to the library of literature that celebrates the wonders of visual experience. The writing is elegant, the information profound. How can we resist a book that opens with an exegesis on various elements of color in nature and on bird songs and Beethoven and declares \"We may aptly term color the music of light\"? The book is both a celebration and a lucid guide: to issues of luminosity and color temperature, and of harmony as well as contrast. And it is a compact dynamo of the history of color theory up to the time of Vanderpoel's writing. The many color plates are magnificent, both in the pleasures they provide and the magic they demonstrate; I feel safe in saying that Josef Albers would have been gobsmacked by this glorious volume.\"\nNicholas Fox Weber\nThe Josef and Anni Albers Foundation\nIn order to produce the beautiful objects you will receive as a backer at such an accessible price we need funds for printing and binding a large run. We aim to print at least 1000 copies, and our goal reflects the production costs for this amount, but the more pledges we get here the more we can print! As an established (although relatively young) publishing company we already have storage and distribution methods streamlined which will make for a seamless experience for our backers. \nWe also plan to spread the word of Vanderpoel's forgotten work as far and wide as we can. We need your help in righting this historical wrong. Tell your friends about Emily Noyes Vanderpoel! They will no doubt be as happy to discover her and her work as we have been. \nPDF - Each backer will receive a download of our high resolution color corrected PDF of the book. We poured months of work into this using the original book as a source. We are delighted to share this exclusive presentation with you!\nBookmark - This elegant handprinted bookmark comes with every copy of the book. It is printed in metallic gold ink on acid free paper.\nPreview of Bookmark\nSoftcover Book - This printing of Color Problems includes a thoughtful selection of paper stocks. Like the original, the text portion of our edition is printed on a soft uncoated natural stock. The 116 color plates are printed on a bright white coated paper stock to best display colors. The interiors will be offset printed with close attention to color reproduction. The book includes sewn signatures for long term durability and lay flat binding for ease of viewing. The cover is foil stamped and includes a vibrant slipover belly-band. We have taken careful measures to ensure all aspects of the production are of the highest quality.\nSoftcover version\nKickstarter Exclusive Hardcover Book - The deluxe cloth-bound Kickstarter Exclusive Edition comes with the same interiors bound into a deluxe foil embossed boards and an alternate belly-band. Like the original book, this Exclusive Edition includes a square compositional viewer and translucent filters tucked in the back. These filters allow the reader to interact with the art works and the world around them in a truly interactive way, and help illustrate some of Vanderpoel's most ingenious ideas about the perception of color. This Deluxe presentation of the book will only be available to backers of this campaign.\nExclusive Hardcover Version with Transluscent Films\nArtist Print - This beautiful 12\"x18\" Fine Art print of COLOR ANALYSIS FROM A BUTTERFLY is executed in-house at The Circadian Press.

Using specialty inks and 100% Cotton paper, these extremely limited editions will last for generations.\nWE HAVE REACHED OUR STRETCH GOAL!\nOne of our favorite details of the original Color Problems printing is the gold and silver metallic pantones that are included in several of the color analyses. You can see an example below of the use of these metallics and the special beauty it adds to the page. We have funded our stretch goal and now we can afford to include these pantones in every copy of the book that we make, both hard covers and soft covers!

We established our makeshift colony on Charon and explored the region. We discovered the Royal Martian Federation (RMF), the Hielo, and the Myst; and made contact.  \nAlthough historical rivals, we worked together to survive the frigid conditions, stockpiling resources and launching probes across the Milky Way.  \nOne probe returned compelling data from the Copernicus System in Quadrant 1. Coper has a yellow dwarf star and an intriguing group of planets. A dazzling radioactive element, that we named Vertium, was discovered. Our physicists think it could heat our colonies, and upgrade weapons and armour.  \nAs word spread, the rebel groups bolted for Coper. The fragile cooperation evaporated. Each faction is now out for itself - claiming planets and mining Vertium. The stakes are clear: for whoever controls the Vertium will control Coper and perhaps the galaxy.  \nBrooks out.\nUpdated Cover - Complex Director & Titan robot\nSkirmish Dice with symbols\n These are the latest dice above, as of June 11.

This is one good example of why we need Kickstarter backers. VERTIUM is an excellent scifi game, but we need extra funds to improve the artwork. We have created four interesting human factions. Better illustrations on the 4 player mats will bring the Soar, the Royal 'Martians', the Hielo and the Myst, to life. This will also allow us to bring in Special Abilities (Advanced Rules). This is on top of manufacturing, shipping, customs, and other costs. Thank you for considering to back VERTIUM. We appreciate it!    \n SOAR [yellow faction] The Soar are a band of First Nations, Americans and Canadians who are active in the heights of the northern Rockies. The frigid conditions neutralized the Titan (the giant killer robots of the Complex), turning them into slow and easy-to-hit targets. The Soar are known for their smarts and never-say-die attitude, and are exceptional fighter pilots. They are also experts in agri, including all manner of cloned plants and animals.  \nROYAL MARTIAN FEDERATION [red faction] At first, the independent \u201cMartians\u201d co-operated with the Complex, but after hearing of atrocities committed across the Earth and on the Moon, they turned against the tyrants. The RMF was founded by Brits and the former EU. Years of pioneering work on Mars, and skirmishes throughout the hundred years\u2019 nuclear war, have made them battle-hard veterans. They are experts in nuclear fission.  \nHIELO [white faction] Descendants from Argentinians and Chileans, the Hielo live in an extensive series of tunnels inside the giant ice sheets of Antarctica. Tech experts, they cause havoc with the Complex\u2019s global systems: knocking out communications between the Complex HQ and the Titan. The Complex have blasted large parts of the majestic ice fields, but can never quite locate the ice burrowers. The Hielo are experts in ice, water, and electrolysis.  \nMYST [black faction] An extremely wise and mysterious people-group living amongst the mist and fog of the Mongolian mountain-tops. Having established their dynasty over much of Asia and Russia, the Myst were forced back to the heights of Mongolia. As with the other remaining factions, they realized the weaknesses of the Titan. Besides the cold and ice, the Titan are terrorized by the swift eagle drones of the Myst. The Myst are also experts in metallurgy.  \nCopyright: Randall J. Thompson / Caper Games.

However, the estimated delivery date is February, 2019. Also, due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others, and there may be some countries we are unable to ship.

My name is Kevin Sherry, author and illustrator of many popular children's books, including The Yeti Files series and I'm the Biggest Thing in the Ocean.\n What I have made here is a brand new 104-page book, filled with fun illustrations, that is a Fantasy Role Playing Game Starter Pack\n Scales & Tales is a rule book, an easy instruction manual and an activity book all in one!\nThe book itself\n Table of Contents include: Classic pen & paper, Tabletop gaming, Terrain, Miniatures & Figurines, Snacks, How to Fantasy Role-play, Create a Character, Leveling Up, Personality Generator, Weapons and Gear, Range, Spell Casting, Combat, and Bad Guy Glossary. \n When I was young, I wasn't allowed to play the classic D & D role playing game.  I think a lot of kids were in the same boat.  Either their parents didn't allow it, or it was just too complicated to get started.\nSo many years later, after I had already published many children's books, my friend asked me to participate in a role-playing campaign that he wrote, and it opened a whole new world for me!\nI realized Fantasy Role Playing was the game I had always wanted to play!  I loved the brainstorming, the collaborative storytelling and the simple joy of having a group of people around a table telling jokes and coming up with a story together.\nHERE'S the THING:  I think difficult gameplay is a real barrier to people who would have a lot of fun in a role playing game, but find some of the rules complicated and difficult to decipher.\nSo with my background in children's books, I've used simple, precise language and hundreds of illustrations to take what I've learned from classic role playing games and present it in a very fun a graphic way.\nWhat's Inside the Book?\n-The first 50 pages are the instructions, the users guide.  Think of it as the Player's Manual and the Game Master's Guide in one.  Scales & Tales explains everything from basic gameplay to character creation , to setting up your DIY game board, to a monster glossary, an armory, spellcasting and more.\nYou start with seven books of magic in Scales & Tales\nIncludes a personality generator to spice up your characters\n-The Second half of the book is a campaign I wrote made of ten one-night quests.  There's instructions and maps for each quest, and the quests I wrote are all great examples of classic role-playing tropes, like: Exploring castles and dungeons, navigating deep forests, a town setting, a quest on a boat, a rescue scenario, a chase scene, all culminating in a grand battle atop the highest castle.\nWhat sets Scales & Tales apart?\nWhile there is a lot of traditional combat in the book, sometimes fighting bad-guys all day gets a little redundant.\nThat's why Scales & Tales contains ways of augmenting your traditional \"End-Boss Combat\" with fun drawing games and party puzzles.  Games like: Telephone, exquisite corpse, blind contour drawing, and Pictionary-Like games.\nAlso, Players learn early in the book how to use a drawing game to summon one of 24 different familiars, Each with their own unique stats.  So each Player can have a little animal companion-who doesn't love that?!\nShown here are half the familiars included in Scales & Tales\nThis book, Scales & Tales, was a self-motivated project for me.  I really needed to write this book to share the joy of role-playing with people who just don't know who to get into it.  \nIt took me two years to write and illustrate, but THIS BOOK IS DONE!\nI put so much of heart and soul into this book, Scales & Tales, so if you've read this far, I hope you will please consider supporting this Kickstarter campaign, and ordering a book.  There's also a lot of really cool Kickstarter Incentives and I'm looking forward to painting some of my supporters hero characters for sure!\nFantasy role playing has opened up a whole new world of creativity and imaginations for me and I'd love to share that with you and everyone with my new book, Scales & Tales.\nHere's a look at the t-shirt incentive:\nScreen printed tank top\nScreen printed T-Shirt", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis book is fully finished, ready to ship.

For ten years, I - The Angry GM - have been dispensing literally the best table-top role-playing game mastering advice ever offered by anyone through my website, TheAngryGM.com. And now, I'm condensing all of my best advice into a book so you can read it while pooping without the risk of dropping $1,000 worth of electronics in the toilet. If you've never played an RPG before, it will tell you how to get started. If you're ready to run your first RPG session as a GM, it'll tell you how to get behind the screen. And if you've been running games for a while, it'll tell you how to actually get good at it. In addition, although the FDA has told us we're not allowed to say this book will cure any chronic diseases, clear up acne, or improve your \"bedroom\" performance, there is technically no evidence that it WON'T do any of those things. \nBut Seriously, What's This Book About?\nIf there was a college course about running table-top role-playing games like Dungeons & Dragons and Pathfinder, this book would be the textbook. Assuming the professor was a little lax in their textbook-selection standards. Because this book does not f$&% around. It doesn't give you any touchy-feelie, hippie-dippie advice about \"making players happy\" and \"always saying yes, and...\" or anything like that. It's like being punched in the gut by actual, practical, useful advice like \"how to actually narrate a scene\" and \"how to know when to use dice\" and \"when it's time to tell your players to stop screwing around and get serious because its taking way too long to get through this combat.\" If you want real, useful GMing advice delivered by someone who could have played the gruff drill sergeant who actually turns out to care about you in any one of those military coming-of-age movies, this is the book for you. \nAnd, look, when I say it's like a textbook for a college course, I don't mean it's dull and hard to read and overpriced like literally any rule-book from any role-playing game ever published. I mean, it starts at the basic level and then works its way up. If you don't have a clue how role-playing games work, it'll get you started. If you've seen a few games played and want to get your friends together and run your own game, it'll help you do that. After that, it drops into a 200-level advanced course and tells you how to go from amateur to expert. \nThis book is great for anyone who wants to run great games. Even people who have never run games. That's why every single gamer should buy two copies. One for them - and yes, we mean you - one for you and one for the kid brother or niece or the weird school or office friend who wants to know how to get into gaming, but who you don't have the time or the wherewithal to run a game for. \nWho is The Angry GM? Why is he Worth Listening To?\nThe Angry GM is me. I got started running Dungeons & Dragons and other role-playing games when I was ten-years old and, thirty years later, I'm still doing it. And ten years ago, I started a website based on telling other people how to do it well enough that people would still be coming back to their games thirty years later. And I've run games for lots of people. Newbies, oldbies, middlebies, experienced gamers, other GMs, kids, adults, the whole shebang. I've run official games for a number of companies at conventions. I've even written seminars on GMing for organized play groups. I really do know my stuff. And that's not all. Actual game designers have liked my stuff so much that they've even asked me to work on their products. Technically, I'm a freelance game designer now.\nAnd I don't believe in fluffy, useless crap advice. I believe in practical, useful advice that tells you what to actually do. And I'm not afraid to tell you in a no-nonsense tone. I'm not here to hug you and kiss you and tell you that there's no wrong way to game. I'm here to tell you that there ARE wrong ways to game and you don't want to do them. And then I'll teach you how to do it right. \nBut Surely, You're Not Doing this Alone!\nOf course I'm not. I'm brilliant, not crazy. My job is just to write this thing. I've got a whole team of people whose job it is to actually turn my great words into an actual book. \nFirst, I'm working with the fantastic Third Act Publishing to actually, you know, turn the words into a book. And the head of Third Act, Jim McClure, he's a dude I've worked with before. He knows his stuff. He's successfully published several of his own games and helped other independent game designers get their stuff to market too. He knows publishing and Kickstarting inside and out. \nSecond, the amazing Big Jon Mosley will be illustrating the book. He's a comic and graphic artist from Long Island, New York and a graduate from the NYC School of Visual Arts. He's done all of the art over at TheAngryGM.com and even designed the character. Well, he drew the character. It's based on the actual Angry GM's actual appearance. But he translated my visage to comic form.\nThird, I've got the unequaled Brian \"Fiddleback\" Casey to edit the thing. He's a freelance game editor and writer and a long-time podcaster. You might have heard his voice reading my words on The GM Word of the Week podcast. Yes, that's him. But his voice isn't what I'm after. I'm using him for the same editing talent he's used on Fantasy Flight Game's Star Wars RPG and Modiphius Entertainment's Mutant Chronicles and Infinity RPG line.\nFourth, we've got the peerless Colin Kyle to lay the book out. Do the layout. To art the layout? Whatever. As one of the founders of Wrong Brothers Gaming, he's an enthusiastic gamer, a social media manager for the Blaze Breakers marketing firm, and he has a PhD in ecology and evolution from U of Chicago. I'm not sure how that relates to his gift for layout design... artistry, but he's got it nonetheless. Also, he finally cleared up our burning question about the actual difference between a frog and a toad. So he got the job.  \nOkay, I'm Sold. But What's the Actual Book Going to Look Like?\nAre you really so hung up on appearances? The content of the book is going to be amazing. I already said that. Who cares what the wrapper is going to look like? \nOkay, fine. The actual book will be a nice, durable softcover book. It'll be digest size, so it'll sit comfortably on a bookshelf amongst either your RPG books or your casual reading books. That's about six by eight inches, if you want to get picky. It'll end up being about 130 pages long. And it'll have nice, black-white-and-gray-scale comic art by Big Jon Mosely.\nThe book will be divided into three major sections. The first section will be for folks who have only a vague understanding of RPGs. That's the kid brothers and nieces I already mentioned. The second section, slightly longer, will be for people - either the newbies or experienced players - who want to jump the screen and organize their first game section. The third - and longest - section will be chock-a-block full of gaming advice designed to help new and experienced GMs \"git gud\" at running games. It'll be easy to navigate between the different sections, so you only have to read the parts you need.\nBlack-and-White Art? 130 Pages? But I Want More!\nI bet you do. Well, look, my goal with this Kickstarter is to get a book into your hands. And to get it there in six months too. People say I'm mad to promise that. I say \"I'm not mad, I'm Angry.\" And I wanted to make sure that was going to happen. So, I'm aiming at the easiest, fastest, most efficient way to do that. \nBut, I want to cram even more content into this thing. A 130-page, black-and-white book is just the beginning. I'd love to add more chapters, more pages, and more topics. And I'd love for the book to be in full color. Jon's art deserves it. So, I've added a bunch of stretch goals. The more support people like you throw at the book, the more I'm going to stuff into it and the better it'll look. \nAnd that's not all. If we can really blow the funding out of the water, I'm even going to make a special bonus available. I'll write a full-on introductory adventure module for new GMs to use when they finally do get behind the screen. With pregenerated characters and everything. Heck, any GM will be able to use it, really. Yeah, I know. I'm awesome. \nSo, if you want more, that's on you. I'm ready to give it. Your support will make it happen. \nThat Sounds Great, But Spell It Out: What Are the Stretch Goals?\nSpell it out? Fine.

We based ELIA Frames on the standard Roman alphabet, since roughly 70% of the world\u2019s population uses it to read and write.\nEach ELIA Frame features an outer frame (circle, square, house) and interior elements that combine to form the main characteristics of standard alphabet letters. \nMost of you looking at this page likely aren't visually impaired\u2014but maybe you know someone who is. Or, perhaps you're a designer who believes in the mission and would like to support the campaign by taking home a poster. Either way, we need your help and support to share our message.\nSource: Braille Reading Rates: \"Reading By Touch\", By Susanna Millar, Routledge Press, 1997\nBraille: the current system\nBraille has been described by Fred Schroeder as \u201cliberating a whole class of people from a condition of illiteracy and dependency, and giving them the means for self-fulfillment and enrichment.\u201d We couldn\u2019t agree more\u2014it is extremely important for those who can read it. However, braille has considerable shortcomings in the 21st century:\nLess than 1% of those who have a visual impairment can read braille.\nOf those who lose their vision as adults (roughly 98% of the population), very few learn braille\u2014so it is not a viable resource for the vast majority of those who have lost their vision.\nBraille requires exceptional finger sensitivity and intellect, along with a lot of determination and time\u2014it can take up to 10 months just to learn the alphabet.\nELIA: our modernized system\nAbout 200 million people with a visual impairment could benefit from ELIA in its current design, and another 85 million could benefit from it if customized to their standard scripts.\nCurrently, the employment rate among individuals with visual impairment is at an estimated 43%. For those who read braille, that rate soars to 85%. ELIA can have the same benefit for the 99% who can't read braille.\nELIA Frames can be learned tactilely in as little as 3 hours\u2014and visually in a few minutes\u2014since the font leverages a previously established alphabet.\nHow to read ELIA\nELIA, Roman, and braille alphabets.\nWith this campaign, ELIA can enable people to gain increased independence and literacy.\nELIA Frames are scalable and beautiful!\nTestimonials \nCheck out this sound clip from BBC Radio 4's In Touch Podcast with Peter White!\nPLAY\n\nI\u2019m a writer and so I work a lot with words and I\u2019m quite interested in anything that\u2019s going to help me read faster or read better. You mentioned when people later in life lose their sight and they lose the ability to drive or read a book, I think it will be enormously helpful for people who are older to be able to sit down and quickly begin to get information from a tactile system again...I had vision up until about the age of 12 or 13, so when I look at the O and the E and the T and the N, they\u2019re quite recognizable. My wife is sighted and I showed it to her and within five minutes she could recognize words. \n- Adam Linn, Writer, taken from Interview with BBC Radio 4\nAs someone who experienced vision loss as an adult, I immediately recognized Elia as a potential tool for those in need of accessing printed information. This led me to feature their story on my podcast. Learning to tactilely recognize the alphabet in less than an hour, along with the availability of multiple font sizes, I knew this system could be especially helpful to seniors in need of labeling household items. As an advocate for people with vision loss I am all for providing people with options that best suit their individual needs. ELIA Technologies is another tool to assist people with vision loss.\n\u2014Thomas Reid, Reid My Mind Radio\nI tried to learn braille three times in my life. I learned the letters easily, but words were difficult for me and sentences really slowed me down. Learning the ELIA system took me only an afternoon. It\u2019s an easier system than braille because it uses actual fragments of the letters of the alphabet that are placed in their own individual frames. I strongly believe that it could be helpful for people who can\u2019t read braille.\n\u2014Karen Kacen\nDon\u2019t ever quit Andrew. This alphabet is important to people who have lost their vision. It can help people remain independent. We fight to remain independent. Because if you lose your independence, then your privacy is threatened. If you lose your privacy, then your dignity is threatened.\n\u2014Elia Vallone (Andrew\u2019s Grandmother, who inspired the creation of ELIA)\nWe tested ELIA with over 300 participants, and analyzed over 175,000 responses.\nELIA keyboards can revolutionize the work of the blind and the sighted, helping them type faster and more accurately.\nDown the line: developing ELIA for ATMs, phones, and more.\nOur design process\nTo design the system, we created and tested hundreds of letter shapes and combinations of letter features. We prioritized the most easy-to-feel features, incorporated them in the most frequently used letters (e.g. the letter \u201cE\u201d is easier to feel than the letter \u201cK\u201d), and then tested those letter shapes to study which were most commonly confused with others.\nWorking \"B\" Frames.\nThe ELIA Frames letters are designed to be understood by touch for those who have a severe visual impairment, to be read by touch and sight for those who have modest visual impairment, and to be read visually by those who have full sight.\nOur process sketches creating ELIA.\nThe printer we hacked to create ELIA.\nPrinting ELIA Frames.\nOur design partners\nThe original design for ELIA was created by our founder Andrew Chepaitis' mother. From there, Andrew, with help from graphic designer Ze Frank, developed the first frames font, and we then finalized the design of ELIA with our industrial designer, Reed DeWinter of Humanfactors Design Works.\nThanks to a collaboration with Order, we've been able to make ELIA as effective and beautiful as possible. Order is a design studio founded by Hamish Smyth and Jesse Reed, who has previously worked on communication design projects like the WalkNYC pedestrian wayfinding system, and Kickstarter\u2019s redesign. Their team built upon our design work to leverage the essential parts with new tools, to help communicate our project in a clear, memorable, and unique way. \nOrder created the Roman alphabet ELIA font using the established ELIA Frames matrix for a cohesive, effective, gorgeous new identity.\nThe ELIA Display font, developed by Order.\nCreating the ELIA font from the ELIA Frames matrix.\nTimeline\nRewards\nDeclaration of Independence poster\u2014in roman alphabet and ELIA Frames, designed by Order.\nDetail shot of the Declaration of Independence poster from Order.\nA mock-up of the ELIA Starter Kit.\nThe ELIA tactile keyboard cover, so you can easily learn the system and type faster.\nOur story \nOur founder Andrew was inspired to introduce ELIA after his grandmother started losing her sight from macular degeneration. A woman who could once finish the New York Times crossword puzzle, she found it difficult to learn braille\u2014it was based on an entirely new system that she had no reference to.\nThat's when Andrew and his mother started thinking of a solution that built on his grandmother's skills, since her case wasn't unique\u2014just 1% of the blind/Visually Impaired (VI) population is born without sight, with the rest losing sight later on in life. Andrew continued his mother's work through the next decade. Thirteen years later, he founded ELIA Life Technology.\nOur team has since received support from the National Institute on Aging, the National Eye Institute (divisions of the National Institutes of Health), the National Institute for Standards and Technology, and NYSTAR. We've collaborated with Lighthouse Guild for the Blind in New York City and have a printing partnership with HP. We've tested our system with over 300 participants, running controlled studies comparing learning ELIA to learning braille or the raised Roman alphabet. We analyzed over 175,000 of the responses from research participants. \nNow, we want to establish ELIA as a mainstream system that will connect people who have lost vision with the rest of society like never before. With this Kickstarter, we will update, streamline, and mass produce our printing technology. \nAndrew and his mom, Elia V. Chepaitis, Ph.D.\nELIA is especially useful for labeling, e.g. for those who take medication for a visual condition.\nWhy Kickstarter? \nKickstarter is a great place to introduce a product, because it's a community of early adopters, innovators and creative thinkers. We're hoping this community will support our project by sharing it with those who actually need it most, and may not have access to this platform.\nThis Kickstarter will serve the most critical needs of people who have a visual impairment\u2014enabling them to retain their literacy, live independently through labeling household items, and learn the skills needed for employment and workplace independence.\nAgain, your funding support will help us streamline and mass produce our printing technology. From there, we'll begin printing books in the ELIA Frames font, to be distributed to libraries and institutions across the US where readers will be able to read the texts and share them with their community. This will be the first step to establishing ELIA as a system across the country, and around the world.\nOur team\nThank you!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWith creating our product, there can always be unforeseen delays in the printing.

You and up to 3 friends play the roles of the surviving leaders and must defeat the armies of Vesh over a series of 7 stories. Each story offers a unique puzzle and has optional objectives depending on how long you want to play.\nThe game features full character customisation, worker management, board exploration, roleplaying-style quests and strategic combat designed for replayability. Experience dice free combat and battle against more than 10,000,000 uniquely generated creatures on a map that has 1,000's of possible layouts, using characters you create by choosing from over 100 different options.\nThere are 6 heroes to choose from, each featuring 12 unique skills and 90 customisable stat points allowing you to specialise in attacking, healing, tanking, area control and worker management.\nThis Kickstarter adds four new World Packs to The City of Kings allowing you to pick and choose the new content you want to have:\nCharacter Pack 1: Yanna & Kuma  \nCharacter Pack 2: Rapuil & Neoba\nSide Quest Pack 1\nHero Pack\nEach Character Pack contains 2 new playable heroes with advanced skills, a new 3 story adventure, and more terrifying creature abilities creating new puzzles for you to solve. \nThe Side Quest Pack tells you more about the world by adding 50 new side quests to The City of Kings, introducing the new \"Get To\" and \"Build\" quests to the game.\nThe Hero Pack adds 6 miniatures to The City of Kings, so you can replace your hero standees with beautifully sculpted miniatures.\nFor those of you who already own The City of Kings, an Upgrade Pack will be sent to anyone selecting the \"Create your own\" or \"World Packs\" tiers containing free copies of the updated Rulebook and Quick Reference booklets.\nDigital versions will also be made available shortly after the campaign for anyone who would like them.\nIn addition to new content for The City of Kings, during this Kickstarter we are offering our new standalone game, Vadoran Gardens for the very first time! Full details on the game, along with reviews and runthroughs are available at the bottom of this Kickstarter page!\n Retailers can find out more info about our retail options by messaging us directly.\nLast update at \u00a3340,000: 34xp | Quest total: 49xp\nThe City of Kings already contains 40 unlocked stretch goals from our first campaign, and we have already fully upgraded Vadoran Gardens to be the best it can be, this means we won\u2019t be adding anything extra to either game during this campaign.  \nHowever!  \nWe are going to be running an adventure over the duration of the Kickstarter which will give you the opportunity to unlock extra scenarios and stories for The City of Kings.\nThese will be released as free Print & Play files between August 2018 and February 2019.  \nHow do we unlock them? By earning XP! For every \u00a320,000 we raise, you will earn 2xp, and every day we will be releasing daily quests via updates, Facebook, Twitter and on our website where you can help earn bonus XP!\nThe City of Kings can be played in 2 ways, by choosing either a story or a scenario.\n7 Stories  \nThere are 7 stories to play, each story has its own objectives and continues a narrative introducing you to the world and characters. Stories are the heart of The City of Kings and will provide you with a challenging, immersive experience.\n12 Scenarios\nThe 12 scenarios provide quick ways to play the game offering smaller challenges of varying difficulty. They focus on different aspects such as combat or worker management and provide endless ways to play, and you can even create your own!\nLet\u2019s go  \nOnce you have chosen a story or scenario, each player will need to choose a hero to play. Each hero can be customised by levelling up, allowing you to create your own role.  \nPerhaps you want to be a long-range attacker or a fast moving, short range healer. If you\u2019d prefer to focus on absorbing damage (tanking) or managing workers, then you can do that too! There are 90 customisable stat points and 12 skills per hero, so you never have to play the same way twice.\nThe City of Kings is played in rounds, during each round you will check if you have completed your objective, update the time tracker and then each player will perform their turn.\nPlayers will move across the board turning over tiles, discovering resources, side quests, hazards, building sites, traders, creatures and more.\nEach player will control multiple characters, their hero and their own workers, who can be used to gather resources, build structures, explore and place traps.\nWhen you encounter creatures they will be generated from a simple set of rules creating a challenging creature for you to defeat. There are over 10,000,000 possible creatures to fight and each will require you to come up with a strategy to defeat it.\n Creatures are persistent, staying on the board until they are defeated. There are no dice*, if your attack stat is 5, you will do 5 damage. You will need to work together, using your environment to absorb the creatures attacks, keep each other alive and to find a way to overcome the creatures' powerful abilities.\n* For players who like to roll dice, there is an optional character stat which you can level up, allowing you to roll dice to modify your attack and heal actions.\nThe Blood-Letter's chase Vyliria and Earthshaker around the board setting fire to the environment. Our heroes try to survive whilst their workers build up the Shrine, giving them the additional strength they need to defeat the creature.\nThe City of Kings offers endless puzzles requiring true cooperation, full character customisation, roleplaying quests, resource management and an immersive experience that we hope you will love. \nYou can download the rulebook here and the quick reference booklet here.\nThe City of Kings is a fully cooperative game with no hidden information and supports solo play through a single player controlling 2 heroes. As such, the game plays the same as it would for 2, 3 and 4 players and you will get the full experience.\n  You can read the full review by Geek & Sundry here.\n You can read the full review by Who Dares Rolls here.\n You can read the full review by Polyhedron Collider here.\nYou can read the full player report by Robert Yates here.\n The following full customisation options can be added to any reward, simply increase your pledge amount by the amount shown below. If you have any questions please ask in the comments and we'll be happy to help you!\nAttention Acolytes! Old V\u2019Sheel, the High Priestess of the Vadoran Gardens is retiring, and maybe one of you will take her place. Go out into the gardens, study her lessons in Life, Nature, and Wisdom to prove yourself worthy of such an honor.  \nVadoran Gardens is a standalone competitive card-drafting and tile-laying card game, set in The City of Kings universe. Players take it in turns to play cards while trying to connect similar tasks such as feeding animals, watering flowers and cleaning relics, as they try and complete the lessons set by Old V'Sheel.\nVadoran Gardens is played over 10 rounds, in each round you will be set a lesson restricting the cards you can play.  \nOn your turn, you will pick up the card you selected on your previous turn (or during setup if it\u2019s the first round), and then place 1 card in front of you.\nThe first card you play will be placed on the table, every following card you play must overlap the last column of the previously played card. The card does not have to overlap all 3 squares in the last column, but it does have to overlap at least 1, giving you 5 options each turn.\nAs you explore the gardens, you will want to connect areas of grass, soil and water to score points and avoid the sand. You will need to connect animals, flowers and statues in specific ways to complete achievements while trying to return lost animals, pendants and tools to their homes.\nOnce you have played a card, you will then need to place your Player Token on the card you want for the next round, this decides both the card you get and turn order for the next round. You will always know what cards you have available for this round and the next, along with what restrictions will be in place, so forward planning is essential.\nYou can download a draft version of the rulebook here.\nIf you would like to get both Vadoran Gardens and The City of Kings then please select the appropriate tier for The City of Kings content you would like, and increase your pledge by \u00a317. You can do this when you select your reward by manually increasing the amount shown by \u00a317, and at the end of the Kickstarter we will ask you to confirm the \u00a317 is for Vadoran Gardens. \nShipping for Vadoran Gardens will be free, when added to any The City of Kings or World Pack rewards.\n You can read the full article by Creaking Shelves here.\n All shipping is EU, America, Canada and Australia friendly, so no custom fees will be charged for these locations.\nUnfortunately we can no longer ship to Brazil due to their customs regulations. If this should change I will let you know.\nIf you would like to help spread the word during our campaign then feel free to download and use our avatars anywhere you like. \nWe have also put together a fan and media kit containing some high resolution photos and artwork which you are welcome to use on your website, social media or anywhere else you choose.\nFrank West is the designer of The City of Kings and Vadoran Gardens, he is also the worldbuilder, art director and graphic designer.\nMiguel Mitchell Da Silva works full time creating the artwork for The City of Kings Universe and creates nearly all of the beautiful pieces of art you will see whilst adventuring in The City of Kings and Vadoran Gardens.\nSara Jorge is responsible for making Frank\u2019s dream became a reality by helping with prototypes, playtesting, design concepts and by believing in him every single day.\nIan O'Reilly is our primary writer assisting Frank with writing the stories and quests you\u2019ll find on our website and in the game.\nAlec Jackson created our visual identity and brand, helping to guide our graphic design.\nWally is our account manager at Whatz Games who are manufacturing the game.\nHeriberto Valle Mart\u00ednez is our primary sculptor and created the amazing miniatures available during this campaign.\nMatthew Walker created the sound track for our Kickstarter project video.\nRosko Lewis provided the voice for our Kickstarter project video.\n We would love to hear from you and talk about The City of Kings, Vadoran Gardens or just gaming in general!

We will be running more playtests as the Kickstarter campaign runs, but we expect any further changes to be minor. \n\nArtwork\nAll of the artwork is done for the core game, we have a few tokens and bits of graphic design to finish off for the expansions but otherwise we are good to go. \n\nMiniatures\nThis will be the first time we include miniatures in our campaign, but we have chosen to work with the same company that is used by CMON to produce their miniatures and are confident the end result will be amazing.\n\nEditing\nThe bulk of the work prior to manufacturing now is copy editing and proof readings of all the new content and rule updates to make sure we catch as many spelling mistakes as possible. We\u2019ve allowed time in our delivery schedule to manage this.\n\nManufacturing\nWe will once again be working with Whatz Games who did a fantastic job for us in the first print and we are confident in their ability to manufacture a great second print.\n\nShipping\nOur importing and fulfilment process went very well during the first campaign, delivering games to all regions within a few weeks of each other.

In this game, players colonize the galaxy using their ships, which they will move on a modular board, allowing for a different map and different experience each time you play the game.\nThe rules are simple: Each turn a player has to move one of his ships in a straight line, as many spaces (star systems) as he wants but he cannot go over systems controlled by other players. After his move, he has to place a Colony or Trade Station on that system, thus gaining control over that system for until the end of the game, for which he will get an amount of points. When all of the players placed their Colonies and Trade Stations, the game ends and points are calculated. The player with the most points is the winner!\nWith these extremely simple rules, players will get into the game from the very start and they will immediately immerse in the depths of the tactical and strategic choices they will need to make, in order to score more efficiently at the end of the game.\n Social Stretch Goal is still active!\nHelp us spread the word around for the campaign by sharing the posts below and for each 20 shares + retweets we will include another Technology card!\nSharing this Facebook post on your timeline: \nhttps://www.facebook.com/smallstarempires/posts/1857701910957675\nRetweeting this post: https://twitter.com/ArchonaGames/status/994663787151192067\nAdditionally, we will be including another Technology card for each AUD $1000 that will be above the AUD $93.000 mark, or more precisely above the final stretch goal! \n To see more details on what the Fate of the Galaxy is all about, check out this Kickstarter Update!\nNew Add-on: TILES and 2 NEW CIVILIZATIONS!\nMake your epic Small Star Empires gaming nights even more epic by including this 5th and 6th player expansion! \n\nAlso, if you buy both the Deluxe 5-6 player expansion AND the wooden component set, you will get the 5-6 player wooden expansion set FOR FREE!\nCivilizations overview\n                                                             Get to know the Civilizations and their Unique Abilities on our blog post here:\nhttp://www.archonagames.com/2018/04/18/the-civilizations-of-the-galactic-divide/\nFor more information on Galactic Warlords visit our BGG Page\n                                       Download the RULES of the Base game HERE.Download the DRAFT RULES of the Expansions HERE.Download the Supermassive Black Hole mini-expansion rules HERE.\nDownload the EPIC GAME MODE rules HERE.\nDownload a Print and Play of a single scenario of the Solo Campaign HERE.\nCheck out Milan's overview of Small Star Empires at Essen Spiel 2016 by BoardGameGeekTV:\n And check out this overview of the expansions:\n Check out the companion Score Keeper app that is available for both Android and iOS!\nDownload the app for Android, or iOS.\n Watch The Dice Tower's review here:\n Watch Undead Viking's review here:\n Read I'm a Social Gamer's review HERE.\nWatch Epitrapaizoume's video review here:\n  Watch Life of a Board Gamer's review for Small Star Empires here:\nRetailers and Group Pledges  \nFor retail and group pledge orders, please write to us at contact@archonagames.com.

The app will still be the intended and most streamlined way to play, but print and play quests offer an alternative.  We will also be providing a template document for players to create their own quests which they can then share with the community on Board Game Geek.\nEach player builds their adventurer by selecting a character card, equipment card, and special abilities card. Builds can range from a standard stealthy rogue with daggers, to a mage that wields a greatsword. Players must work together to slay monsters, complete encounters, and achieve the goal of their quest. Each quest has a different goal, from escorting a priest to complete a ritual, to killing a giant troll that has been terrorizing a nearby town.\nThe companion app handles the quests and encounters allowing for quick setup times and streamlined gameplay. Random encounters and quest generation provides variety and replayability even when playing the same adventures. Using an app also allows for gameplay to be re-balanced and additional new content to be added after release.\nDeck Box Dungeons supports 1-2 players. With two copies you can play up to 4 players. Games typically last 30-60 minutes, but may vary depending on player count and the quest selected.\nHigh quality components are important to us. All cards will be 310gsm ivory core with a linen finish. The custom dice are engraved and composed of compressed resin, and the meeples will be made of wood.\nSetup - Quick, simple, and gets you playing fast.  Select your quest in the app and setup any starting dungeon tiles displayed.  Then build your characters, shuffle the item deck, and you're ready to go!\nRound - Rounds are broken down into three phases, player, enemy, and refresh. Players take turns activating each round in any order. Each player has two actions to use each round. The main actions are move and attack, but quest specific encounters can add new options.\nExploring - Dungeon layout is handled by the app and the same quest may have multiple layouts or be completely random.\nCombat - Combat is D6 based where 6's are successes. The number of dice you roll is determined by your equipment card, and you then add any modifiers from your equipment or character cards to your results.\nAbilities - Character abilities use Energy and are free actions which may be performed at any time. Abilities add more options for players and are great for things like combo-ing attacks, supporting other heroes, and more.\nSkill Checks - In addition to combat stats, heroes also have different skill stats which are modified by the abilities you choose. Skill checks are used in encounters to add more depth and choices to quests.\nCustom Dice - The enemy dice are custom designed to track the type and health of enemies.  They are also used to gain loot and scale according to enemy strength.\nRules - The final rules, including a tutorial, will be built into the app.  In the meantime, you can view the latest version of the rules by using the link below.\nClick here to view Rules PDF\n                                                       We need your help.  Without you we would not be able to manufacture the game and create the Android/iOS apps to the quality standards we have set.\nThe game design and artwork is 95% done.  We may make adjustments based on the Kickstarter, but for the most part things are ready to go.  We have production and shipping quotes in hand.\nWe also have a working web based protoype app that is fully functional.  If there are any issues that delay the final app, the game is currently fully playable with the web prototype.\nHighly expandable.  Be one of the first to enter the world of Deck Box Dungeons.  We see this as a highly expandable game with plans already in place for the future of the game.  Because of the app and our custom designed enemy dice we believe most expansions will only require a new deck of cards.  That means lower cost expansions which makes them much easier to produce.\nQuality components are very important to us. We decided to have them from the beginning instead of upgrading things with stretch goals. Therefore, all of our stretch goals focus on adding more content.\nCalder's story quest has been unlocked!\nDelyth's story quest has been unlocked!\nAylen's story quest has been unlocked!\nSalmarin's story quest has been unlocked!\nNaeva's story quest has been unlocked!\nDunael's story quest has been unlocked!\nPrint and play quests have been unlocked and add the ability to play without the app. These quests may vary from the ones in the app. We will also be publishing a template document to allow players to create their own quests to play outside of the app!\nUnique meeples have been unlocked and will replace the standard meeples!\nAn additional double sided Ability card has been unlocked and will be included with every copy!  This will add two more options for Ability sets when building your character.\nAn additional double sided Equipment card has been unlocked and will be included with each game!  The new card will two more weapon options when building your character.\nUpgraded cards have been unlocked!  Cards will now be black core instead of ivory core.\nAn additional Item card has been unlocked for the market deck! Items are consumable and can offer help and unique options in battle.\nAn additional double sided Hero card has been UNLOCKED!  This will add two more hero options and even more options for character builds.\nZeke Walker (Designer) - Zeke founded Ariah Studios to better support his previous web and mobile games (and possibly to help support his Kickstarter habit).

For these reasons we have decided to charge shipping after the Kickstarter campaign ends.\n1 Copy: US - $5-7 | Rest of World - $11-15\n2 Copies: US - $8-10 | Rest of World - $16-20\nPlease note these are only estimates.

Virtual reality has come at a cost they can never pay, a tradeoff of freedom for technology. But there are freedom fighters who reject the system, unplugging from the illusion and working to make things right once again. They are la R\u00e9sistance. \nRise up and defy the corporations in the Uprising: The Dystopian Universe RPG, set in the same universe as The Resistance, Coup, and One Night Revolution from Indie Boards & Cards.\nAre you already a backer? Then go to this backers-only post and download the latest copy of Uprising right now!\nFound a typo or other error in the draft? Let us know! We're collecting them here.\nLooking to support a local retailer by preordering Uprising through them? Encourage your FLGS to back us and get their copies early!\nUprising is the roleplaying game based on the hit Dystopian Universe (DU) games from Indie Boards & Cards, including The Resistance, Coup, and One Night Revolution. Like the other DU games, Uprising is about cunning spies and government agents, loyalty and betrayal, propaganda, unrest, and violent revolution. Unlike the other games, it\u2019s a roleplaying game or RPG. Uprising uses a modified version of the Fate Core rules. You\u2019ll step into the identities behind the cards\u2014or make your own\u2014and foment rebellion, betray close friends, aid enemies, and hopefully survive the dark and gritty streets of Paris Nouveau.\n\nAn RPG? What\u2019s that?  \nIn a roleplaying game, all of the players work together to tell a story--in this case, one about the lives of revolutionaries in the cyberpunk world of Paris Nouveau. Most of the players are PCs or player characters. These players decide what their character will do in response to what's happening in game. One person at the table will be the Game Master or GM. This player decides what the opposition and supporting characters do. When a character takes action, the player will roll the dice to see how successful (or unsuccessful) that effort is, but the real fun is in deciding together what happens next.\nYour cyberpunk Paris experience may vary.\n  What if I\u2019ve never played an RPG before?\nYou're in luck! RPGs are a lot of fun, and we've made special effort to insure this one is accessible to fans of the other DU games who might never have tried an RPG. Inside, you'll find the following beginner-friendly elements:\nCharacter archetypes based on familiar DU cards \u2013 Ever look at the cards during a game of Coup: Rebellion G54 and wonder what the Aristocrat or the General was thinking? This is your chance to find out first-hand!\nBeginner-friendly instructions \u2013 All this group storytelling sounds great, but what exactly do you do? This book lays it all out, along with an example of how it would play at the table.\nCharacter playsheets \u2013 Like the other DU games, all of the characters fall into familiar types. Pick a playsheet, customize it, and get playing quickly.\nSample missions - To help out new GMs (and anyone short on time!), we\u2019ve provided a series of pre-made missions. All the pieces, plot points, and characters are provided!\nStep into the Dystopian Universe\n\nI\u2019m a Fate fanatic! What\u2019s in it for me?\nFor gamers familiar with Fate, Uprising offers some new and exciting mechanics\u2014not to mention that compelling cyberpunk setting. Inside, you\u2019ll find the following new elements:\nSecrets \u2013 Fate Core is built around camaraderie and teamwork, but at its core, the Dystopian Universe is full of backstabbing and deceit. Uprising provides a mechanical system for in-character secrets that will keep everyone at the table guessing.\nPrep scenes \u2013 Do more with your downtime than just refreshing your Fate pool with the new prep scene rules. Request favors, requisition equipment, and create advantages to use later.\nNew action rules \u2013 Instead of skills or approaches, Uprising uses means\u2014Fight, Manipulate, Maneuver, and Observe. Adjust the outcome depending on whether the means fit the end goal.\nAdvancement system \u2013 Instead of milestones, character-specific goals lead to character growth\u2014and sometimes put the characters at odds with each other.\nIn Paris Nouveau, danger lurks around every corner.\nAt KS launch, we\u2019ve already got a laid out copy of the game, which you can download immediately upon pledging. We're still finishing up the art, and we'll be sharing the development of the last few pieces with you throughout this Kickstarter! Next steps include proofing (which you can help with by downloading the instant PDF and reporting any problems here), finishing up that art, and print production.\nOur current timeline has Kickstarter fulfillment happening in December 2018, but we're looking at possibilities to shave some time off of that. Of course we\u2019ll keep you notified of how we\u2019re doing at every step of the process. We\u2019re rather proud of our track record when it comes to prompt KS fulfillment and excellent customer service, and, as always, we\u2019re committed to making this KS a positive experience for our backers.\nThe PDF: As a backer of this project at any level, you'll get immediate access to the early preview PDF before the Kickstarter campaign concludes. We're doing this because we want to make it easy for you to decide if this game is for you, particularly if you\u2019re new to RPGs. It also gives you a chance to provide us critical feedback that will improve the game in its final form. We\u2019ll update the final PDF for backers at the $20 level and up, as soon as that\u2019s available. But folks who don't back this project will have to wait a few months before they'll get their hands on that.\nPlease note that you'll see some art placeholders in the book (outlines or blank boxes). If that wasn't clear above, we'll be filling those in with the remaining art once it's done.\nThe Hardcover Book: Those backing at $39 and higher will receive a 6\"x9\", hardcover, 310 page, full color version of Uprising: The Dystopian Universe RPG. Shipping late 2018.\nDigital Bonuses: All backers at $20 and higher will receive a download link to a digital bonus pack. This downloadable folder of awesomeness will include copies of Fate Core, Fate Accelerated, Venture City (our superhero flavored cyberpunk supplement), and Designers & Dragons: The 70\u2019s (the first volume in our four book history of the RPG industry), plus sample chapters from recent releases Fate Adversary Toolkit, Dresden Files Accelerated, and upcoming releases Tachyon Squadron and Scum and Villainy.\nUNLOCKED: POD Secrets Deck: Once we reach $10,500, we'll unlock a digital coupon code for a POD copy of the Secrets Deck from DriveThruCards for all backers at $20 and up. The book comes with printable secret cards so you can get playing immediately (and you'll be able to download a clean PDF of them from our website), but we'd like to offer a more durable card option. The code will allow you to purchase the POD version at cost (around $1.22 based on our current quote, as opposed to the $5-or-so we'll charge outside of this KS) plus shipping.\nUNLOCKED: Paris Nouveau Corporate Catalog: Once we reach this funding goal, we'll unlock the Corporate Catalog supplement for all backers at $20 and up. This electronic-only, approximately 5000 word supplement will include more corporations to act as foils, antagonists, or uneasy allies; equipment produced by each corporation to provide an easy PC-purchase list; and additional corp-specific implants and contacts.\nUNLOCKED: Safehouses and Hotspots: At $23K, all backers at $20 and up will unlock the Safehouses and Hotspots supplement. This electronic-only, approximately 4000 word supplement will include 2-page spreads with ready-made encounters that the GM can drop into existing missions. GMs can also repurpose the included NPC stats for use in a home-brew mission.\nUNLOCKED: The Second Fall and Other Stories: Our next stretch goal is for The Second Fall and Other Stories, which will be available to all backers at $20 and up. Many of the missions in the core book are stand-alone, but some connect into a loose story arc. This downloadable, approximately 5000 word supplement will provide additional story arcs, each broken down into six connected missions. These can be chained together or run as a ready-made campaign. Once we unlock this goal, we\u2019ll start writing!\nUNLOCKED: Beyond the Walls: Once we unlock this stretch goal, we\u2019ll start working on the Beyond the Walls, which will be available to all backers at $20 and up. This supersized supplement (at approximately 10,000 words) will focus on a new city beyond the walls of Paris Nouveau, with a different style of oppression. It will include a setting write up, a trio of missions, and a new social class with three new playsheets.\nUNLOCKED: Invisible Hands: The Black Market: Once we unlock this stretch goal, we\u2019ll start working on the Invisible Hands supplement, which will be available to all backers at $20 and up. This 5000 word electronic supplement will give you a look at the underbelly of Paris Nouveau\u2014with echoes of the Grifters of the Dystopian Universe. It will include new underworld contacts and plenty of illegal tech to fuel your campaigns.\nUNLOCKS AT $52,000: Upfrancisco Uprising: Once we unlock this stretch goal, we\u2019ll start working on a profile of Upfrancisco. Take your Uprising campaign to an entirely new setting and country with this 10,000 word electronic supplement. It will include a setting write up, a trio of missions, and a new social class with three new playsheets.\nAs with our other recent Kickstarters, we're charging a flat $6 shipping fee.  This also allows us to subsidize the shipping a bit--the actual S&H costs will be more than the $6 we're charging you.\nWe'll also be using BackerKit, where you'll also be able to configure your rewards. BackerKit is a pledge manager--a separate website that gives you (and us!) greater control over what happens after the campaign than a simple survey would. You'll also have the option to add on a few select items via the BackerKit if you choose to do so, with no extra shipping costs.\nWe\u2019ve made the difficult decision not to offer international shipping in this Kickstarter. To put it simply\u2014the shipping costs our distributors are able to offer is as much or more than the products we\u2019d ship. We can\u2019t in good conscience ask you to pay it. However, we still want international folks to be able to get their hands on the goodies. You can try a freight forwarder or a friendly American willing to forward the shipment to you. If that's not feasible for you, we've made it a point to make all of the materials available in an international-friendly electronic tier to make sure you can join the uprising no matter where you live. And of course we'll make the book available in international distribution, when we get to that point.\nDevelopers: Brian Engard, Anna Meade\nEditor: J.D.

We've printed many role-playing games in a variety of physical formats over the past few years\u2014twelve in the past two years alone. This puts us in a fine position to take on the risks and challenges that will arise. Experience tells us that things don\u2019t always go as planned.\n\nHere's what we can anticipate as potential problems.\n\nThe Art: The art could take longer to execute than we're hoping it will, or could simply manifest in a fashion we find unsatisfactory (requiring a 'do-over'). Artists are people with real lives and those lives come with schedule-complicating problems. If any delay looks like it will be short, we'll likely roll with it, and we'll let you know what's up. If it looks like something long, we have an assortment of other artists we've worked with over the years who we know can execute quickly and on-time for a deadline.\n\nThe Text: While the editing, layout, and playtesting of Uprising is largely done, it's possible that you will identify some glaring issue that we need to address before we take this fully to publication. That can add time, for sure. Luckily we have several talented writers available if we need a fix, as well as layout and editing people on standby, so any necessary changes should proceed quickly.\n\nPrinting: We have a strong, established relationship with our printers. We\u2019ve got them on tap to print the books in whatever quantity we end up needing. But printers can run into problems all the same: supply shortages, unexpected delays due to company holidays or industry events, shipping problems, printing errors, and so on. We\u2019ve got the experience to stay atop those potential problems and the flexibility to pivot and address them promptly. In the event of defective product, we will send a replacement at no cost to you.\n\nShipping: Packages get lost. We'll send replacements. Shipping can take longer than expected. We won't put the book on sale until they've shipped out all backer copies. Shipping costs can end up higher than expected. We'll absorb the overage.\n\nFinances: Thanks to the success of the Dresden Files RPG and our other projects, Evil Hat is a perhaps atypically solvent RPG company. We've already invested time and money to get Uprising to this point, and our bank account continues to look plenty healthy. If an unexpected cost arises, we've got the cushion to take the hit.\n\nIf there's any risk or challenge YOU can think of that we haven't mentioned here, please write in and ask. We love to answer questions, and we do our best to provide an unparalleled customer service experience whenever possible.

Icetongue, the thousand-year-old glacier, melts overnight. The deluge wipes out all but one community, Tomar's Crossing, which now faces food shortages, monsters dislodged from lairs, and deadly ancient secrets uncovered with the ice's passing.\nYour players must help the people of Tomar's Crossing survive, battle their enemy through three dungeons \u2014 Fort Frostfell, Gardong Marhold, and finally, the Duladarin Star Elf Barrows \u2014 and confront Ralekai the necromancer in his underground laboratory.\nThe Frozen Necromancer adventure takes PCs from 1st to 5th level.\nThe actions of the PCs in the Frozen Necromancer shape the political climate of Tomar\u2019s Crossing and the ever-stronger dangers crawling the Luna Valley for the second part of The Demonplague campaign.\nIn this sandbox adventure, the PCs delve into ancient ruins, temples to forgotten gods, dark tombs, and secret meeting places to find the words and components of a lost ritual that just might save the world...or end it.\nThe Winter Druids' Legacy adventure takes PCs from 5th to 10th level.\nIn this hexcrawl adventure the PCs head out into the uncharted wilderness of the ruined valley.\nThey'll face undead demons, fiends from the Abyss, mutated wildlife, deranged druids, and starving giants.\nIf they\u2019re lucky, the adventurers fight their way to the entrance of the prison meant to hold a mighty plague demon\u2026and discover the walls are cracking.\nIcefall takes PCs from 10th to 15th level.\nThe grand finale draws the PCs into a magic prison that holds the plague demon Xancrown.\nAs the adventurers negotiate, deceive, and battle guardian factions within the prison, they struggle with the ultimate question:\nShould they sacrifice the Luna Valley to ensure the world\u2019s safety for another thousand years, or attempt to kill Xancrown and end his terror forever, which risks destroying their entire plane of existence if they fail?\nThe Xancrown's Prison mega-dungeon adventure takes PCs from 15th to 20th level.\nAbout the Designers\nThe Demonplague was crafted by Johnn Four, publisher of RoleplayingTips.com and published author of over a dozen GM books and courses, and James Introcaso, an ENnie-winning blogger, multiple-time platinum best-selling DMs Guild author, and co-owner, host, and producer of Don\u2019t Split the Podcast Network.\nBacker Rewards\nThe goal of this Kickstarter: put The Demonplague in your hands. We know you'll enjoy GMing the gritty sword and sorcery setting of the Luna Valley with all its mysterious locations the PCs can explore to unravel the Demonplague mystery.\nTo make that happen we need your help to cross the last mile. We are keeping this Kickstarter short and simple, as we only need funds to hire a designer and artists for page design, layout, and maps.\nShipping: Print Book Fulfilled by DTRPG\nThe backer tier price is low for the print version because you will be paying DTRPG directly for base print cost and shipping.\nThis means lower shipping costs for you, especially in the EU, because DTRPG can ship to you from a nearby distribution centre.\nWhen you back the print version of The Demonplague, you will receive a redemption code from us. That code gets you the entire adventure as a printed book and you only pay the cost of printing and shipping through DTRPG.\nHow Much Will the Print Book Cost?\nWe won't know until the final version is submitted to DTRPG for approval.\nBut their cost calculator says a 400 page softcover comes to $10.53 USD and a 400 page hardcover comes to $15.70 USD (black and white pages, large size).\nHow Much Will Shipping Cost?\nThis will vary by country, the final page count, and the final weight of the book.

The Return of the Lazy Dungeon Master uses the experiences of thousands of GMs to help us focus on how we prepare our games, how we run our games, and how we think about our games. It includes practical steps for focusing our preparation activities on those things that will bring the biggest impact to our game.\nFive years ago, the Lazy Dungeon Master offered a simplifed approach for preparing fantasy RPGs with one clear directive: prepare only what most benefits our games. This focus on lightweight preparation and improvisational preparation resonated with many GMs over the past five years.\nBut during that time and with the release of the fifth edition of Dungeons & Dragons, the world of fantasy roleplaying has changed and expanded. With five years of new systems and new ideas, all GMs have a wealth of experiences to share and explore to help us prepare and run great RPGs. Return of the Lazy Dungeon Master builds off of the concepts of the well-received GM's guidebook Lazy Dungeon Master, updating that book with five years of new experiences, new approaches, and new observations of the way people prepare and run RPGs. This new book is a completely self-contained work, which does not require anyone to have previously read The Lazy Dungeon Master.\nReturn of the Lazy Dungeon Master offers a new focused approach for preparing and running our roleplaying games. The book includes an eight-step guide for lightweight game preparation and is focused on how we prepare for our games, how we run our games, and how we think about our games.\nYou can check out the PDF preview of Return of the Lazy Dungeon Master or check out the table of contents below to see if it's the right book for you.\n   Based on research involving hundreds of books, videos, articles, and interviews with top Gamemasters, as well as thousands of results from Gamemaster surveys, Return of the Lazy Dungeon Master helps us understand the best tips and tricks used by GMs all over the world to bring the most fun to our games.\nPrepare what benefits your game.\nAbout This Kickstarter\nThe full text of Return of the Lazy Dungeon Master is complete. Your funding towards this Kickstarter will go towards the editing of the book by veteran RPG editor Scott Fitzgerald Gray, and the layout and art direction of the book by veteran RPG art director Marc Radle. The book will also include internal art by Pedro Potier. Here's an example of the art.\nThe Lazy Dungeon Master Workbook\nAs this Kickstarter grows, we will put together a Lazy Dungeon Master Workbook. This workbook will include a wide range of tools, maps, and reference sheets to help you run your 5e roleplaying game. It will have a brand-new cover by Jack Kaiser and is intended to be used right at the table. All backers will get the PDF of this workbook and digital versions of the maps. Backers at the $13 level will be able to order print copies of the workbook for the cost of printing (about $6) and shipping (about $6 in US and UK).\nHere are some example worksheets we will include:\nLazy DM Reference Sheet \nSession Preparation Worksheet \nCharacter Tracker Campaign Worksheet \n5e Cheat Sheet \nRandom NPC Names \nRandom Traps \nRandom Single-Use Magic Items \nRandom Dungeon Encounters \nRandom Fantastic Features\nBelow you'll see some example draft reference sheets. Note that these sheets have not yet gone through formatting or design.\n5e Quick Reference\n Trap Generator\nLazy Lairs\nThe Lazy Dungeon Master Workbook will also now include ten \"Lazy Lairs\" including full-color maps of commonly-used dungeons and one-page write-ups with descriptions, read-aloud text, and area aspects. They're designed so you can easily use them in your game with little to no preparation needed. These Lazy Lairs will be included in the Lazy Dungeon Master Workbook and all backers will receive digital versions of these maps with fully-annotated DM versions and unannotated versions for use in virtual tabletops like Roll20 and Fantasy Grounds.\nHere are two example maps by Derek Ruiz and Daniel Walthall.\n  Stretch Goals\nLazy Dungeon Master Workbook PDF ($5000 - Unlocked!). All backers will receive the Lazy Dungeon Master Workbook PDF. \nInternal Artwork ($6,000\u2014UNLOCKED).

This format is perfect for reading the book on a phone, tablet, or e-reader.\nHardback Version At Cost for $13 Pledges ($10,000\u2014UNLOCKED). Those who back at the $13 level will be able to buy the book in a deluxe hardback edition. This collector's edition will be available from RPG Now for the cost of printing, about $15, and is perfect or sitting in a comfortable chair, drinking a favorite beverage, and pondering how to make your next game awesome. You do not need to increase your pledge above $13 to have this option. You will receive a link to order the book at the cost of printing and shipping when the book is ready.\nFive Lazy Lairs ($15,000\u2014UNLOCKED). The Lazy Dungeon Master Workbook will contain five full color maps of common locations we use in our D&D games including Caves, Temple, Castle, Sewers, and Dungeon. These maps will be done by Daniel Walthall, Derek, Ruiz, and Miska Fredman.\nFive More Lazy Lairs and a Print Version of the Lazy Dungeon Master Workbook ($20,000\u2014UNLOCKED).

We expect the cost of printing to be roughly $6.\nHigh Resolution Cover Artwork (2,000 backers\u2014UNLOCKED). Every backer will receive high-resolution JPEGs of Jack Kaiser's covers for each of the books suitable for printing or using as a background for a phone or tablet.\nLazy Lair Descriptions ($30,000\u2014UNLOCKED).

This means you will be able to purchase a copy of Return of the Lazy Dungeon Master directly from RPGNow at the cost of printing and shipping. We expect this cost to come to roughly $6 for the softcover book and $15 for the hardcover book plus $6 for shipping in Europe and the US.

Earth and its surrounding colonies are ruled by a group of corporations called the Trade Federation. The Federation\u2019s policies are focused around trade and growth, but especially on profit and prosperity for those at the top of the corporate ladder. While they prefer to deal with other star realms using trade and diplomacy, they have a large defense branch dedicated to protecting the Federation\u2019s trade and other interests.\nThe Trade Federation specializes in generating large amounts of Trade and in gaining Authority (increasing your score).\nThese mysterious creatures are the first alien life forms encountered by the human race. Most of the initial encounters consisted of human colonies being completely obliterated. On the few occasions that a Blob ship has been recovered somewhat intact, the only biological remains found inside have consisted of a gelatinous mass, thus leading to the moniker, \u201cThe Blobs.\u201d While for several years all encounters between humanity and the Blobs have been extremely violent, there is currently some limited trade between various Blob factions and some of the more-daring human traders.\nThe Blobs are best at generating massive amounts of Combat and at removing undesirable cards from the Trade Row.\nThe Star Empire consists primarily of former colonies of the Trade Federation. These colonies were on the outer edges of the Federation. Not only did they feel used by the corporations, but they felt the Federation failed to give them adequate protection from the Blobs. As a result, one ambitious colonial governor was able to unite several colonies into an independent empire under his control, one with a strong military, both for warding off the Blobs and for discouraging the Federation from trying to reclaim their lost colonies. \nThe Star Empire is a combat-oriented faction that draws many cards and makes the opponent discard cards.\nA cluster of industrial mining worlds were completely cut off from the Trade Federation by the Blobs. With the threat of annihilation by the Blobs always looming and no contact with the rest of human space, these worlds were forced to take drastic measures. Soon a cult of technology arose, focused on using advanced technology, robotics and computerization to create strong defenses and a powerful military that belied their relatively small population. Since their leaders believed their salvation lay in technology, technology soon became their god and their religion.\nThe Machine Cult gains most of its power from being able to remove undesirable cards from your deck and from having a large number of Bases designed to defend your Authority from attack.\nA New Frontier\nIn the early days of space travel, the need for fast and efficient colonization drove the corporations of Earth to invest heavily in warp gate research, headed by Nathan Martin, a brilliant scientist ahead of his time. Martin's team executed many successful tests of this new technology, and the decision was made to create a massive deep-colonization fleet to send through the gate.\nDespite Martin's protests that more testing was needed, the fleet was assembled and colonists chosen. After the colony fleet were sent through, people of all nations watched in growing horror as the automated probes on the other side of the gate never recorded the fleet's arrival. The entire fleet had been lost!\nWith thousands presumed dead and staggering financial losses, a painstaking investigation was initiated. A fatal flaw in the warp gate generator was discovered. Each use of it had made tiny fractures in space time, and that had made each future use more likely to fail. The technology was abandoned.    \nHundreds of years later, after humanity was split by the arrival of the Blobs, the Trade Federation quietly started up Martin's research again. Unsatisfied with their share of plunder from the Colony Wars, the Trade Federation had grown desperate for new, uncontested worlds to exploit. Research funding again poured into the ancient warp gate technology and a breakthrough was achieved.  \nThe Trade Federation began to explore and colonize distant planets, far from previously explored space. Their exclusive access to this remote region of space was short lived, however. Hackers stole the warp gate research and sold it to the highest bidders amongst the Star Empire, Machine Cult and the Blobs.\nNow, all the factions race for a foothold in this new frontier!\nVideos and Reviews\nThere are many videos and reviews of various Star Realms sets online.

You will first see this in the forthcoming Pirates of Drinax campaign, which details the Trojan Reach, and we are bringing forward the same approach to the sectors of the Great Rift.\nAs well as the histories and worlds of the explored systems, each sector includes rules on its own unique vehicles, spacecraft, aliens, animals and diseases. While you read about the great agricultural-transfer ships that service the population of Oleiros, you will also see complete High Guard statistics and deck plans for them. As you discover the vicious meteor swarms of R'Bak, you will be provided with the rules to inflict them upon passing ships.\nIn a nutshell, you are not only getting four sectors in the Great Rift, you are also receiving everything needed to incorporate them into actual game play.\nBut that is not all.\nThe Great Rift provides us with an opportunity to turn away from civilised space and begin exploring the truly dark corners of the Third Imperium universe. This box set allows Travellers to tune their sensors to empty regions of space, identify anomalies of interest, and then begin huge multi-jump voyages to truly uncover the unknown.\nThis is where the Deep Space Exploration Handbook comes in.\nWe really like this book!\nIt begins by showing Travellers how to investigate an otherwise empty 'hex' on sector maps, by the use of sensors, scouring astronomical data, voyaging into deep space, and even listening to veteran spacers in the local starport. All this is taken into account when the Travellers attempt to find out what might lie then.\nThe Handbook then takes you on a journey through what may be found in the depths of space - anything from fully-fledged systems, proto-stars just forming, nebulae and, of course, black holes (and yes, we have rules for what happens to your ship in all these places!).\nAn expanded star creation system takes the referee through the process of generating brand new worlds, from the central star(s) to the furthest planetoids, complete with guidance on assigning orbital positions.\nFinally, the book is rounded off with a selection of spacecraft dedicated to investigating the unknown and supporting deep space expeditions, including the Armstrong-class exploration vessel featured on the front of the box, a rugged and reasonably priced 1,000 ton ship that will be perfect for Travellers to begin their own expeditions.\nDeeper and Deeper - Stretch Goals\nWe were always going to do a sourcebook for the Great Rift, as part of our mission to produce maps and background for every sector in the Third Imperium universe (a mission that may never be completed, but we are aiming for you to be able to plaster a very big wall with our new sector maps!). However, a Kickstarter allows us to push the boat out a little further, depending on you - and you responded magnificently!\nStretch Goal 1 - Passed!\nWe are already adding Great Rift Adventure 1: Islands in the Rift. The Travellers will arrive at Amondiage in the Old Islands subsector to recover a starship for their client. The job is easy; bring the ship to Zuflucht for transfer to Imperial space, but with the Islands on the brink of war and outsiders under suspicion, the task may not be a simple one after all. \nStretch Goal 2 - Passed!\nThere was no stopping you, and you broke the next stretch goal! We are now adding Great Rift Adventure 2: Deepnight Endeavour. In this adventure, the Travellers stumble upon a clue to the location of exploration ship Deepnight Endeavour, missing in the Great Rift for over a year. If they can improvise some way to cross several parsecs of deep space, they may be able to reach the stranded ship and rescue her survivors. But Deepnight Endeavour holds deadly secrets, and exploration of the wreck will become a desperate fight for survival.  \nWe are planning for the Deepnight Endeavour to be a large ship, with deck plans featured on a new large poster map. We will also be adding a new sector to one of the books of the Great Rift box set, likely Afawahisa (reserving the right to change the sector, but we want to push further into the Rift).\nStretch Goal 3 - Passed!\nYou have asked for us to super-detail a system deep within the Great Rift, and that is exactly what we are going to do! \nMartin has already sketched out the Phobetor system, discovered long ago by an ESA ship launched by an Anglo-American alliance in the 22nd Century, the Shackleton mission. The ship created a colony in the void of Touchstone sector, which persists to this day - but the Aslan know of a dark secret that has kept them far away from the system...\nWe will be adding this system to the Great Rift box set, giving your Travellers new worlds to explore and another hint of the mysteries that lie waiting to be discovered as they venture further into deep space, unlike anything they have yet seen in the Third Imperium.\nStretch Goal 4 - \u00a395,000\nFor the final stretch goal of the Great Rift project, we will be adding Great Rift Adventure 3: Flatlined, a survival-horror adventure set in Reft that places the Travellers in a lonely outpost, filled with less-than-stable personalities, and surrounded by an alien menace. Will they last the night?\nThe Deep Space Explorer's Pack\nWe wanted to avoid a long and complex Kickstarter with multiple pledge levels - this Kickstarter is for the Great Rift box set and nothing else (though it may well grow in size with your help!). However, we also realise that some Travellers out there may not be completely equipped for deep space exploration of the Great Rift, and we would not want to send you off into the big black without adequate support!\nTherefore, we are also offering backers the chance to pick up any of the current Traveller hardback rulebooks at a discounted rate of \u00a330 each, with the PDF copy of the book thrown in! These include:\nThe Traveller Core Rulebook\nHigh Guard\nCentral Supply Catalogue\nVehicle Handbook\nSimply add \u00a330 to your pledge for each title you are after, and we will take care of the rest. We'll get in contact with you after the Kickstarter is complete to see which titles you want, and will send them to you immediately (no waiting for the Great Rift, you will get them straight away).\nAs with the Great Rift box set itself, shipping is free worldwide.\nIISS Senior Scout Pledge Level: Note that you can get all four hardbacks and the Great Rift box set with additional savings by pledging at IISS Senior Scout level!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWait a minute, you ask, hasn't Mongoose always run late on its Kickstarter projects?\n\nWell, yes, that is true. However, we have always delivered and if you were to ask one of our previous backers of, say, the new Paranoia, we believe you would also hear that the quality of our Kickstarter projects is always worth it.\n\nThat said, we have taken steps to ensure the Great Rift does not over run its projected completion date. \n\nFor a start, more than half the text is already written (the Deep Space Exploration and Reft books are complete) and work has already begun on the artwork - this is where the preview PDFs have been drawn from, and you will see more previews throughout the Kickstarter as we are working on the Great Rift right now.\n\nSecond, we have brought Traveller-writer Martin J Dougherty on board to pen the Great Rift. Not only is Mr Dougherty a regular fan-favourite among veteran Travellers, he is also a true professional and one of the most reliable writers Mongoose has ever worked with in our 16 years of business. \n\nIf Martin says a manuscript is going to be finished by a certain date, you can be sure you will see it by then, and he will be popping into the updates we will be doing throughout this Kickstarter to let you know just what he is working on and to gauge your opinion on previews.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a31 or more", "title": "Stargazer", "descp": "You like the idea of exploring space, but want to keep your feet on solid ground.

In it, players take on the role of a starship captain stranded in hostile space. As captain, you'll be tasked with assigning crew member to various stations in order to deal with external threats like enemy spaceships, as well as internal threats like system malfunctions. \nOriginally starting as a print & play game, Deep Space D-6 released commercially in 2015 through a successful Kickstarter campaign. Beautifully minimalistic and tightly designed, the small print run was quickly consumed by avid gamers of all types and stock has been scarce ever since. \nIt's time to return to the deepest of deep space! Whether you are an accomplished D-6 Captain or have never tried a solitaire board game before, I'm glad to have you aboard! Now is your chance to get a hold of Deep Space D-6 with a revised rulebook. In addition, there is a new mini expansion that brings a new threat to the galaxy. This is a rescue mission and we'll need all the help we can get. \n          What's new in the reissue? \nThis is a straight reprint (not a 2nd edition). The first Kickstarter unlocked a wealth of enhancements and the box is at max capacity. As such, there will be no stretch goals and only minor changes from the first printing. The components are largely identical with the following revisions:\nRevised Rulebook - added some card clarifications\nHull and Shield cubes now have rounded corners\nOuroboros gameplay text has been modified\nRead more about the changes here.\nNew RPG game mode:\nClick the image to learn more.\n  The Long Way Home is an optional roleplaying supplement for DSD-6 that will be made available for free to all backers in the months following delivery of the game. A professionally printed version may happen in the future, but will not be part of this campaign. \nEach turn in Deep Space D-6 you'll roll crew dice and assign them to stations to perform unique ship actions. There are 4 unique ships, each with unique strengths and weaknesses. \nYou can learn more about the game by visiting the original Kickstarter campaign here. \nHere are some videos made from the first printing:\n   Special thanks to all video contributors!\nWant to know more? Check out the original rulebook.\nOr try the Print & Play.\nMagnetic one-piece box\n4 Ship Boards\n6 custom 14mm crew dice, 1 standard threat die\nThreat Deck of 54 cards including the Ouroboros Boss Encounter  \n8mm plastic Hull and Shield tracker cubes\nRevised Rulebook\nInfirmary card\n  As with all my Kickstarters, you won't find crazy positive video reviews/previews or extensive marketing campaigns with stretch goals where I try to maximize funding by over promising. As an independent publisher, I believe in investing in a solid product, and not my ability to convince you to back it. The following videos are completely independent and have no affiliation with Tau Leader games. \nThis video nails my design intention regarding the interesting decisions and how they are less about the random dice rolls, and more about deftly managing threats and resources:\n  See more written and video reviews at BoardGameGeek.com\nFound this cool piece on reddit: I'm really surprised how well designed Deep Space D-6 is\nCalling all captains! A new threat has been detected. We don't know where they came from or what they want, but their numbers never seem to end.\nnon-final artwork\nTo defeat this new threat you'll have to perform overkill effects or be prepared to be overwhelmed by rapidly deploying enemy fleets. The Endless feed off each other and the more of them on the board, the more dangerous they become. Lucky for you, we've got ship upgrades available to help you overcome this radical new threat. \nThe Endless Expansion, available for the first time through this Kickstarter consist of:\n54 new cards including external threats, internal threats, ship upgrades, and a new final encounter.\nReplacement Ouroboros cards to bring the 1st edition inline with the 2nd printing.\nNote: You do not mix this new expansion with the base game cards. This new mini-expansion plays on it's own but requires the base game. However, the upgrades can be used with the original threat deck. Fully compatible with all 4 ships. Yes, it fits in the base game box.\nThe nice thing about this campaign is that shipping is no longer a mystery. Final box dimensions and weight have been predetermined. Shipping for this project is a subsidized rate of the actual shipping costs I was charged from the original Kickstarter campaign fulfillment. \nTo see the shipping rates, click on the pledge tier you are interested in and it will display the different costs based on your region. \nGames will be shipped through fulfillment centers primarily in China, the EU, and the US. This reduces custom fees and VAT. \nBackers are limited to 3 total games per pledge. You may add up to 2 additional copies and/or any number of expansions for the listed pledge price. There is no extra shipping charge.\nPlease note: There is an error in the Fleet Commander pledge. The estimated delivery is not November 2017. Estimated delivery for Fleet Commander pledge is December 2017, just like the rest of the pledges. \n  Tony is a visual designer and UX specialist currently residing in New York.

I\u2019m a Los Angeles-based writer and director of online shorts (like Old/New, Real Gone and Plot Device) and branded content for clients like Bad Robot and Red Giant. I created the Storyclock Notebook as a research and development tool for writers like me.\nOoh Aah, That's How It Always Starts\nIn my experience, I've found that the second best part of writing is the beginning (the first best is finishing), when inspiration strikes and it feels like someone is beaming the story to your brain from an alternate dimension.\nYou're not so much making it up as transcribing it, relaying it. Your ideas at this point are like tribbles, growing and growing off of each other.\n...Until they're not.\nThe transmission eventually stops, and you're left with a pile of disjointed and half-baked ideas. And now it's up to you to turn them into a story.\nNow just turn this mess into a story. No bigs.\nCut to: the Storyclock Notebook.\nPicture Your Story Like a Clock\nThe Storyclock Notebook utilizes the simple method of visualizing your story like a clock.\nSeeing your story this way can quickly give you a bird's eye view of it, and reveal where your gaps are.\nThere's a gap.\nAnd rather than filling these gaps by making stuff up and dropping in ideas from the outside, you can extract ideas from what you already have -- using symmetry.\nWhat\u2019s happening on the opposite sides of the clock? Anything you can set up or pay off?\nIt's a simple and effective exercise to fill the gaps in your story with relevant and meaningful material, born from what you already have.\nThis doesn't mean Lawrence Kasdan wrote Raiders with a story clock, but it demonstrates that good stories have a \"rhythm and rhyme.\"\nA Research + Development Tool\nThink of the Storyclock Notebook as a research and development tool. The first half of the book is devoted to studying and analyzing existing stories, with the second half devoted to developing your own. \nThis is a Development page. The left is where you dump your brain, and the right is an empty clock to start laying out your ideas in a narrative structure, and start filling out your story.\n   This is a Research page. Sometimes it helps to rip off-- er-- STUDY the choices of other writers, so we've devoted the first half of the book for clocking existing stories.\n Purpose-Built for All Kinds of Stories\nWe designed the Storyclock Notebook for screenwriters, but it works for other storytelling mediums, too!\nIt's not just for screenwriters!\nBuilt-in Resources\nOn the inside covers we\u2019ve put a bunch of storytelling resources to serve you in your quest.\nNerd stuff!\n  A general story structure guide and list of archetypes inspired by much smarter people like Joseph Campbell, Blake Snyder, and basically everyone at Pixar.\n  A page/time converter that comes in handy far more often than you'd expect.\nThe Design\nThe Storyclock Notebook was designed to be both practical and creatively inspiring, a tool for perspiration and inspiration. Something that makes you WANT a reason to use it. For this we ended up leaning on old industrial handbooks and research logs to find the look and feel.\nThe touch... the feel... of industry!\nThere are 12 Research Logs and 12 Development Logs, a couple pages in the back for miscellaneous notes, and a table of contents page in the front for easy referencing and filing of your endless ideas and research.\nPrinting the Notebooks\nGuten Co. letterpresses all of our covers in San Antonio, TX, where the Earth's gravitational pull is optimal for letterpressing journal covers.\nOur friends at Guten Co. will be letterpressing the covers of the notebooks at their studio in San Antonio, TX.\nGuten Co. was indispensable in the development of the Storyclock Notebook, helping us source materials and finish proofs so we could field test it and get as close to the finished product as possible before revealing it to the world.\nIf you\u2019re looking to letterpress anything (i.e. business cards, invitations, posters that say WANTED in huge letters) or want some sweet handmade ceramic goods (seriously, come on), check out Guten Co!\nBecause the binding process is tedious to do by hand, we will print the interiors and bind the notebooks together at a larger company in Nashville, TN, where we will also pack + ship them out to our backers.\nSpecs\n5.5x7\u201d Finished Trim Size; 52 Pages\nCover: Neenah Environment \u201cWeathered\u201d 110# Cover\nInterior Pages: 80# Cougar Text - Natural\nWho's Responsible?\nThe Storyclock Notebook was created by me (Seth Worley), designed by Micah Lanier, and produced by Anne Fogerty.\nTeamwork!\nWhy Kickstarter?\nJust gimme it.\nWell firstly, I really want this notebook. We\u2019ve had a small number of proofs printed over the course of developing this, and I\u2019ve ended up using it to write 2 feature-length screenplays, a tv pilot, 3 inspirational talks, 2 company presentations, and a wedding toast. Oh and a Kickstarter video.\nMaybe? Maybe?\nI feel like other people could benefit from this as much as I have, and Kickstarter is a great way to find out how right or wrong I am about that. After being involved in other friends\u2019 campaigns and backing several projects over the years, I\u2019ve been able to see and experience firsthand the unique benefits Kickstarter has over traditional development routes - the biggest being YOU. By releasing the storyclock notebook on Kickstarter, I\u2019m able to get your feedback and input before we ever print it, ensuring that by the time it makes it to your hand, it\u2019ll be the best possible version of itself.\nExtra Extras!\nAlong with the notebook, we'll be offering extra awesome tools and resources in higher tiers to help you on your story quest, including:\nVideo Tutorial - A short video from Seth to help you make the most of the notebook.\nWriting 101 Pack ($55 Value) - 11 videos from Seth walking through the basics of story structure, character, theme, and a comprehensive walk-through of outlining a story in the form of a clock.\nWriting 201 Pack ($60 Value, Pre-Release) - The highly-anticipated sequel to the Writing 101 pack, not-yet-released!\nSkype with Seth (Pricelesssss) - Get 30 minutes of Seth's time to talk about whatever you want.*\n*Mostly to talk about stories. Keep it PG (maybe PG-13 because Seth acts like a 13-year-old [not really (ok yeah kind of really)]).\nWhat Do I Get?\nWe've got several reward tiers to cater to your personal (notebook-related) desires:\nWhere is my money going?\nSince we\u2019ve already done most of the development of this notebook (believe it or not we\u2019ve been working on it for two years), your contribution will go towards:\nNotebooks - letter-pressing the covers in Texas, printing the interiors in Nashville, and binding the books in Nashville as well (because these are physical goods, every notebook purchased adds extra cost).\nReimbursement for Development Costs - We\u2019ve already spent money to get this off the ground (illustration costs, fonts, proofs, etc) and so this will help pay people for the work they\u2019ve done.\nFees - Kickstarter is awesome and because it costs money for them to operate we\u2019ll owe them some money. And also credit card fees. We factored all of this into our goal amount.\nWe chose $12,500 because we think that number will help us at least hit breakeven on the cost to produce these notebooks. If we bring in \u201cextra\u201d money - which depends on how many backers we have for each tier, we hope to include some fun surprise flavor for you when you receive your notebooks.\nWhere you at?\nYou can follow us on Instagram at @StoryclockNotebook, or follow me on Twitter at @awakeland3d.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe've spent a couple of years developing this notebook, and we're super excited to be sending it out into the world. At this point, as weird as it sounds, the biggest risk and challenge to us is not meeting our goal. If we don't meet our goal, these notebooks will not see the light of day (other than the 10 proofs that we printed).

Be anyone, go anywhere and do anything. It's your show. Be a hero!\nWhen the original Rory's Story Cubes set was first released back in 2008, The Creativity Hub's Anita and Rory were just two people with a game and a firm belief that it needed to exist out there in the world. We never dreamed that this simple storytelling game would take on a life of its own. Whether it's at a games convention, in a classroom or refugee camp, during a hospital visit or just a quick couple of minutes before a meal, Rory\u2019s Story Cubes has been bringing people together and acting as the spark that ignites their imagination. With over 10,000,000 possible combinations in the base set alone, the stories that have been told by players of all ages continue to surprise and delight us every day. Now, with well over one hundred different StoryCubes available in various sets and themes, the potential for storytelling is almost limitless. \nFor quite some time, we\u2019ve wanted to create something that captures what we love about roleplaying games - the shared world building, the constant twists and turns, watching your character grow - then marry it with Rory\u2019s Story Cubes to create a simpler, more accessible experience for a wider audience. This is a project that\u2019s been brewing for a while, but now we think we can honestly say that we have designed something rather special. Untold: Adventures Await is here, and we can't wait for you to play it!\nWhether you want a solo adventure or to play as part of a group, Untold has got you covered! (Prototype components shown)\nUntold: Adventure Awaits is a customisable storytelling game powered by Rory's Story Cubes where you play the heroes in your own adventure series. Think of it as throwing you and your friends into a favourite TV show, but rather than passively watching, you're caught up in every scene and make the decisions on which way the plot will go. Each adventure-packed episode takes less than sixty minutes to play from start to finish and requires no preparation - you jump straight into the adventure! All it takes is a copy of Untold, a set of any nine StoryCubes of your choice, and the combined imagination and inquisitiveness of the players. From there on, anything can happen...\nSome favourite moments from our playtester games!\nDesigned by John Fiore (The 9Qs, World vs Hero) and Rory O'Connor (Rory's Story Cubes), Untold offers a highly accessible storytelling game experience for one to four players. With just a few decisions at the beginning of the game, a storyline quickly emerges that draws the players in then propels them through the game towards a climactic finish.\nPlayers can use literally any combination of StoryCubes they wish - whatever sets you choose to use will help establish the Series they want to experience. Whether it's fighting crime on the streets of Gotham City or blasting off into space with your squad of friendly dinosaurs, travelling through time with Doctor Who or saving the lives of patients in a busy ER, your options are near limitless! \nWith the Series decided, players begin the story (or Episode) with a roll of their selected StoryCubes, then encounter the initial threat facing their world as part of the Danger Scene. Only then do they create their heroic characters for this story! In the Intrigue Scene, players reveal an plot twist and discover that things are not as they appear. As the players become even more caught up in the story, the Confrontation brings them face to face with a foe they must now defeat.\nA dramatic Revelation is designed to knock players off balance before they head towards the epic, all-action Showdown... but the story doesn't end there. If players choose to continue the series, they can keep their characters and bring them through to a brand new episode. Perhaps old friends or foes will return? Maybe allegiances will change over the course of a series of episodes? Only by playing can you discover where it all ends.\nFeedback about Untold from some of our testers!\nOur focus has been on creating a game where the story is key and entertainment value is high. Through the questions you ask and the actions you take, the world you collectively create gets deeper and deeper. Built on a simple but effective framework, Untold: Adventures Await can take you anywhere!\nThe central board will be covered in awesome art, hopefully inspiring your incredible heroes!\n  Soon original pencil sketches will become fully finished sections. It'll be very busy around here - keep an eye out for updates!\n  Check out this handy video for the full rundown on how to play Untold: Adventures Await. We cover everything from setting up your world to dealing with the all-important final Showdown!\nWe'll be putting playthrough videos up during the course of the campaign - and here's the first! Watch out for our LIVE playthroughs where you, the audience, get to tell us what to do!\nHere's the second playthrough, this time with a family of four - Debbie and Andrew play with their kids, Sadie and Marcus, in an adventure through the jungle! Just a heads up, the sound is a little dodgy at times in this video, but we're sure you'll love their story!\nAnd our third playthrough, presented by Rory and Michael from The Creativity Hub! Part gameplay video, part how-to-play, they travel through the world of Steamlandia and face off against mysterious groups in a bid to save the world... again!\nStay tuned for future episodes in our regular updates! And if you want to play the game right now, click here for Update #4 where you can download the files required - though remember, you'll need your own set of StoryCubes! Also, please note that we're still tinkering with the rules and are still making small changes and amendments. Once the final rules are locked down, we shall of course publish them for everyone to ready, but for now the current set will hopefully give you a good feeling as to where Untold is heading!\n  Prototype components - not final art!\n Each copy of Untold: Adventures Await will contain:\n1 set of nine Rory's Story Cubes \nCustom-Cut Episode Board \n30 Custom-Cut Scene Tiles that will lock your StoryCubes in place (6 each of Danger, Intrigue, Confrontation, Revelation and Showdown) \n15 Reaction Cards \n4 Player Aid Cards \n4 sets of Player Toolkit Cards (5 cards in each, 20 cards total) \nAdventure Journal Pad \nHero Sheet Pad \nRules for group and solo play\nCheck out the video above for a rundown on what we're planning for the production! The game will retail at \u00a325 in the UK, $30 in the United States and \u20ac30 in the EU, but backers to the campaign will receive their games at a significant discount!\nBackers will receive everything listed above in the base Untold set. Other levels add in StoryWorlds sets from some of your favourite fandoms. The Untold: Ultimate Collection level comes with the base game and every single other currently available StoryCubes set - the original one comes in the game, and you'll also receive the following:\nThree different StoryCubes Core Sets: Actions, Voyages and Fantastia \nSix different StoryCubes StoryWorlds Sets: Batman, Doctor Who, Looney Tunes, Moomin, Scooby Doo and Adventure Time (to be released this Summer!) \nTwelve different StoryCubes Mix Sets: Clues, Prehistoria, Intergalactic, Medic, Score, Fright, Animalia, Rescue, Powers, Strange, Explore and Rampage\nWant to get your hands on even more StoryCubes? Maybe even some excellent storage solutions? We've got you covered! If you'd like any of the following items, simply increase your pledge by the required amount. \nPlease note: If you wish to get these extra items as part of your pledge, you must amend your pledge before the crowdfunding part of the campaign is complete. This means you must have that organised by 8pm UK Time on Thursday, June 8th, 2017! There will be no opportunity to add extra items at once the Kickstarter is complete, and we will not be offering any late backer slots.\nApproximately two weeks after the campaign is complete, we'll confirm precisely what you want through the survey that we'll be sending out. Once this goes out, please fill it in as quickly as possible so we can get things moving at our end!\nPlease note that everything shipped from this campaign will be in the European StoryCubes packaging with English language rules. Also, for our American backers, this is the only way you can guarantee getting your hands on the majority of the three-Cube Mix Sets for the foreseeable future. \nFor more details on each of the items below, check out the StoryCubes Collection page!\n          Of course, we know that everyone on Kickstarter loves getting extra things, so we have plenty of plans for Stretch Goals too! Every backer also receives a set of our awesome Rory's Story Cubes: Batman alongside their copies of Untold: Adventures Await, as well as a Token Set in each copy of the game which will help players keep track of the Questions they ask and Actions they perform AND a limited run box sleeve for your game with the Untold logo in Spot UV adorning the front!\nOur next Stretch Goal is at \u00a320,000 and will allow you to create your very own work of art - kind of. We've had a lot of people asking us about the board art and whether we'd be able to make a print of it later down the line. We've also had some folks asking for a black and white line-art version they they (or their kids) could colour in. So, why not have both? At \u00a320,000, our final stretch goal will be unlocked: a line art version of the awesome Untold Board art that you can colour in (if you're so inclined) or put up on your wall!\n  Despite Rory's Story Cubes being available all around the world, The Creativity Hub isn't a global powerhouse! We're a small, close-knit team based in Belfast, Northern Ireland, working hard each day to create great things that are not only fun to play, but bring meaning and depth to that experience. Untold, frankly, is a major step into the unknown for us. While we're positive about the game and know that it's fun to play, there's no way that we can guarantee there's a place out there for it. Running this Kickstarter will give us indications about demand for Untold as well as other titles that we have in the pipeline!\nRegarding shipping, the final games will be sent from our partner warehouses in Northern Ireland and the United States, meaning that the game is guaranteed to be Customs Friendly for Europe and the US. Backers from countries outside these areas may be subject to import fees, but we're working on making these Customs Friendly too.\nPackages will be sent via tracked, signed for shipping. While we realise that the cost is a little higher than just sending them through the regular mail, we hope you think that the fact delivery is guaranteed within a matter of a few days rather than several weeks is worth it. Should any issues arise, we'll be ready and willing to assist however possible! \nGame Design: John Fiore and Rory O'Connor\nGraphic Design: Winnie Shek and Rob Dalton\nGame Development: Patrick Nickell and Rory O'Connor\nMarketing and Media: Michael Fox\nMusic: Funny Song by www.bensound.com", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhile this is the first Kickstarter project for The Creativity Hub, we have built a team of experienced industry professionals to ensure that the process of making Untold goes as smoothly as possible.

That's where you come in!\nBy sharing this video on Facebook and this video on Twitter, we can reach hundreds of other families who have never heard about No Thank You, Evil!. If even just some of those families back this Kickstarter, that\u2019ll really help us hit stretch goals and give us more reasons to create other expansions for No Thank You, Evil! in the future.\nUPDATE Nov 7: YOU DID IT! You got 50 shares of the Facebook video and 50 shares of the Twitter video, so Shanna posted a video of herself reading Lucy Lawful and the Awful Waffle! (If you\u2019re not familiar with Lucy Lawful, it\u2019s a super-fun book that\u2019s available as part of the deluxe version of No Thank You, Evil. You can grab it in the I WANT TO BE EVEN MORE AWESOME! level.)\n  No Thank You, Evil! is an award-winning tabletop game of creative make-believe, adventure, and storytelling. In No Thank You, Evil!, each player creates a character based on a couple of cool, descriptive, imagination-firing traits. The Guide (a special role often played by a parent or older sibling) presents a dilemma, and the players set off on an adventure of the imagination. Along the way they use their character\u2019s special skills, companions, and equipment to overcome obstacles\u2014perhaps fighting a slime monster, winning over the suspicious mayor, or beating a rabbit at a race. Whereas conventional board games constrain players\u2019 actions, No Thank You, Evil! sets kids\u2019 imaginations free: Their options are limited only by what they can think up. Together, the players create a story as they work together to make their way through the adventure. For more detailed info on the setting, game rules, and characters, visit the No Thank You, Evil! web site.\nThe Standard Edition of No Thank You, Evil! contains everything you need to play, all in a beautiful, sturdy box designed to be easy for children to use. It includes:\n\u2022 No Thank You, Evil! rulebook\n\u2022 Let's Go On An Adventure! adventure book\n\u2022 Five dice\n\u2022 Character sheets\n\u2022 Cards for characters, creatures, and cyphers\n\u2022 Game tokens\n\nNo Thank You, Evil! was released in March, and is available at specialty tabletop game stores and from the Monte Cook Games website. This Kickstarter campaign is funding two expansions for the game.\nThis Kickstarter offers two new expansions to No Thank You, Evil!\nSTORY, PLEASE! An Adventure-Building Deck For No Thank You, Evil!\nStory, Please! is a 100-card deck stuffed full of evocative art and creative ideas, letting you quickly build hundreds of unique adventures for No Thank You, Evil!\nIt's easy: just combine an engaging STORY card with one or more cool PLACE and PERSON cards to outline your quest.

We'll also send you a special kit of promotional and point-of-purchase materials, and promote your store via our website and social media in the weeks before the game's launch. We anticipate you'll receive your product before it becomes available through conventional distribution channels, and you are welcome to offer it for sale ahead of the official street date. (NOTE: We anticipate that you will have Story, Please! as much as three months ahead of street date. We intend for that to be before Christmas, but we can\u2019t guarantee it.)\n      We've hit five stretch goals so far, and with your help, we can achieve even more! \n\nHere's how the Random Wheel of Stretch Goals Works: every time we hit a stretch goal, we're going to roll a d6 and see which stretch goal we achieve! \n\nOur next goal is set at $60,000. If we hit that, we will make Flying Colors: A Story Coloring Book!\n      REWARD FULFILLMENT  Soon after the No Thank You, Evil! The Adventures Continue Kickstarter campaign ends, we will invite you to review your pledge on BackerKit. This allows you to confirm your pledge and add anything that you might have missed.\n\nWhile we use BackerKit to organize backers, pledges, and add-ons, we don\u2019t fulfill rewards through them. Instead, your rewards from this Kickstarter campaign will be fulfilled through the MCG Shop, which puts you, the backer, in charge of redeeming them at your convenience.\n\nHere\u2019s how it works: when your rewards are ready, we\u2019ll send you an email with a coupon code to redeem them. You decide when to use the coupon, and give us your correct shipping address. If you have multiple rewards coming, you may delay redemption of some and bundle them together if that\u2019s more convenient for you (or you'd like to save on international shipping costs). We guarantee a product will be in stock for you as one of your rewards for at least one year after the product's release date. This applies to all methods of shipping described below.\n\nIf you move between reward shipments, you won\u2019t need to tell us, since you\u2019ll simply enter your new address the next time you redeem a reward. If this is a gift and you want to ship it directly to the recipient, simply enter the recipient\u2019s shipping address as the Ship To address when you redeem your reward.\nDOMESTIC SHIPPING We offer USPS basic shipping within the United States for free. If you\u2019re super-eager to get your rewards, you can upgrade to a higher shipping class, but you\u2019ll be charged accordingly at the time of fulfillment.\nSHIPPING WITHIN THE UNITED KINGDOM AND EUROPE* Your reward will be filled by our shipping center in the UK. The cost of shipping is not included in your pledge. You will be charged shipping at the time of reward redemption. However, it will be much less expensive than paying for shipping from the US to you, since you will not be charged importing/customs fees.\nThe UK shipping center ships to the following countries: Austria, Australia, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Republic of Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, The Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.\nINTERNATIONAL SHIPPING International shipping is not included in your pledge. (Backers in the UK or Europe: please refer to the previous section, above.)\nInternational shipping is expensive. We don\u2019t have any control over that, and we can\u2019t accurately predict what shipping rates will be at the time of fulfillment. If you\u2019re an international backer and have questions about shipping rates, we recommend you visit the USPS website to get an estimate. Please also be aware that you are responsible for import duties, taxes, and brokerage fees, and that we must comply with international law and cannot mark your reward as a gift or as a zero-value item.\nIf you have multiple items coming as rewards, you can mitigate shipping costs by waiting to have several of them shipped together. We guarantee that each reward will be available for a minimum period of one year from its official release date.\nTo ease the burden of international shipping costs, we subsidize all non-UK/Europe international customer orders and backer reward fulfillment orders with a $10 discount. You\u2019ll pay the shipping costs at the time of fulfillment, minus the $10 discount, which is automagically (and invisibly) applied through the inner workings of the MCG Shop (you won\u2019t see the discount reflected on your order, but it is applied to all international orders outside of the UK/Europe). In other words, if the cost to ship the parcel to you is $52, you\u2019ll pay $42. The $10 shipping discount is applied once per parcel, not per item.\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nMonte Cook Games is an experienced publisher of roleplaying games, including the ENnie-award winning game, No Thank You, Evil! This is the 8th game-related Kickstarter that we've launched. All our previous campaigns have been successful and jam-packed with rewards, and we\u2019ve delivered nearly 200,000 rewards on schedule.\n\nBut every publishing project carries risks. We have a small staff, so if one of our team gets eaten by an argle-blargle, it would have a bigger impact on our work than a larger company might see. And we rely on outside suppliers and shippers for printing and manufacturing, which involves possible risks there we can\u2019t foresee or control. But we deal with those concerns all the time, and continue to put out high-quality work on schedule.\n\nOf course, there\u2019s always the danger of ninja attacks, zombie flash mobs, or aliens landing. But our staff is spread out across the country, so we\u2019re unlikely to all be wiped out at once. Unless it\u2019s aliens.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 20 or more", "title": "STORY, PLEASE!", "descp": "You get Story, Please! in print and PDF formats.\nINCLUDES:\nStory, Please!

Because of your support, I have reached 100% of my goal and can without any hesitation say that this book is GETTING PRINTED!!! Because of this and your continued support, I will be able to expedite the books to you, my Kickstarter backer, in December. For any orders after the campaign is over on October 15th those will have to be pre-ordered and will be available in February or March.\nThis 192 page \"how-to\" book is packed with my personal approach to Character Design, Drawing, and Exercises for personal improvement. The Silver Way: Techniques, Tips, and Tutorials for Effective Character Design. Foreword by Mike Krahulik/Penny Arcade\nA brief bio\nMy name is Stephen Silver, and I am a character designer and teacher. I have designed characters for Disney Television Animation, Sony Feature Animation, Nickelodeon Animation, and many more - establishing the style of shows such as Kim Possible, Danny Phantom, and Kevin Smith's Clerks, the Animated Series. \nMy purpose and passion in life is teaching. I have taught and lectured at schools and companies all over the world. I currently teach online at Schoolism.com, and at SilverDrawingAcademy.com in Simi Valley, California. I am proud to say that many of my students have gone on to work for companies like DreamWorks, Pixar, Disney, Nickelodeon, Cartoon Network, Warner Bros., and a variety of other studios.\n        What is this book about?\nWhen I was six years old, I found an artist\u2019s sketchbook laying in my back yard, and that book changed my life. It inspired me to draw things I did not understand quite yet and to practice all the time. It is for this purpose that I want to create a book that I feel will help shape another artist\u2019s life. \nHaving been asked for many years by students, designers, and teachers for a \"how-to\" book, I decided it was time for me to create one. It\u2019s based on all of my notes and theories for designing and drawing that I have gained over the last 26 years of my professional career. \nWhether you are working in animation, video games, comics, or any form of media, a character designer\u2019s job is to invent, and convey a concept from a description. The goal of this book is to provide aspiring character designers and artists interested in this field, with a better understanding of the character design process. Most importantly, it will provide the tools needed to produce effective characters. \nMy techniques and tutorials will help you build your confidence and strengthen your knowledge of the art of character design - allowing you to successfully design for any project, in any style. In this book, I am sharing all of the knowledge I have developed through my years of experience as an artist in the entertainment industry. This is the book I have dreamed of for years, and the book I wish I had 26 years ago. It will not disappoint.\n\"Good character design needs to illustrate the character. Posture, expression, even clothing should all communicate what the character is all about. The best characters immediately look like they do what it is they do. Your Character Design class has been a big inspiration to our art direction, and we would highly recommend this book to every aspiring artist.\"- Sanguine Productions\nWhy do a Kickstarter?\nI have chosen to do a Kickstarter because I wanted to create something exclusive for my supporters, and felt this was the best way to do it. For this specific book, I'm happy to say all the image files and preliminary text have officially been submitted to Design Studio Press, my publisher, and is currently in the final stages of development. Printing can get expensive, and as the creator, I am in collaboration with the publisher and am responsible for my printing costs. \nWith support from you, I can physically make it happen, making it available to artists worldwide who wish to learn my design process. I will also be able to create an exclusive limited hardcover edition, and with your support, be able to release this book sooner than later. This platform is great because I am able to create additional rewards that would not be possible to offer in other venues. It is my hope that the stars will align in order to make this all a reality. \nI am often asked what I feel has been my greatest success in my career. In all honesty, I believe the knowledge I have acquired and will be able to share in this book will be my greatest success. It is special, unique, and sums up all of my tips and techniques for helping artists self-correct their work. I will be sharing new tools and theories that have never been in print, along with exercises I have personally developed - all of this will help you better understand the power of observation from life, in order to create your own unique voice, and the studio production way of designing. \nI am grateful to you, and thank you for your belief and support.

Read the full comic FREE at DriveComic.com\n  Hi, I'm Dave Kellett, and I'm making a hardcover collection of my sci-fi comic, DRIVE. I've been creating the story at DriveComic.com, and it's entirely free to read (go try it!). And now, it's time to collect the full Act One into a gorgeous, 288-page hardcover. \nDRIVE is my favorite kind of sci-fi: Hilarious characters in a serious story. A mashup of \"Hitchhiker's Guide\" and \"Dune,\" if you will. \nIt's placed in a Second Spanish Empire \u2014 a galactic empire \u2014 which finds itself staring down a war with an alien race called \"The Continuum of Makers\". Humanity has built its empire using technology stolen from the Makers, and these creatures want it back with an almost religious fervor. In the brewing war, it's clear that humanity will lose \u2014 and lose badly \u2014 unless they can find some advantage in battle. That hope arrives in the form of a tiny, mysterious creature who can drive a starship like no one's ever seen. Now all humanity needs to do...is find 10,000 more pilots just like him. But no one knows where he's from.\n  The 288 page hardcover book will be 8.5\"w x 9\"h (21.6cm x 22.8cm) and gorgeously printed. The hardcover includes a fancy, built-in ribbon bookmarks, super classy \"End-Papers,\" five short stories added in, as well as never-before-seen concept art, protective shrink-wrapping for transit -- and even comes with five bonus digital goodies, including STRIPPED, the comics documentary: An iTunes #1 documentary! \nHere's a quick guide to help you decide what rewards you'd like for backing the project! First: Ask yourself if you want digital eBook, a softcover book, or an awesome hardcover with all the bonus stuff...then go from there! \n  This Kickstarter is about the production of a book \u2014 so all backers at all tiers $10 and up will be getting a copy of the DRIVE book: Be it digital, softcover or hardcover.\nIn addition to the book, higher tiers will also be receiving awesome items such as...\n  We've flown through the Kickstarter goal and THIRTEEN stretch goals. What does that mean for you? It means your book has magically gotten better and better, while the price stays the same. Check it out, below... \n  FULFILLMENT SHIPPING will be be handled by the professionals at Topatoco.com \u2014 who handle millions of dollars in orders every year. Also, they're really kind people: Which is just a nice life bonus.\n\nWe're charging exactly what it costs us for shipping and handling, but alas...if you live in Australia, New Zealand or Canada, shipping costs are what they are. Surprisingly, though, we were able to get really good shipping rates to the European Union: So hooray for that!\n  Directed by: Fred Schroeder \nEdited by: Ben Waters \nMusic:- \"Quirky Dog\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\n- AudioBlocks.com\n- \"Mars: The Bringer of War,\" by Holst, performed by the Air Force Band", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is my 3rd Kickstarter, and my 13th book, so I'm feeling confident about this project.

After the campaign closes I'll send you a survey through BackerKit and you will be able to easily select all the Add-Ons you wanted.\n          (If you are International and REALLY want to add something to your order, please message me and we can work out the shipping costs)\nI'll be adding more Add-Ons to this section as the campaign grows so please check back for more soon!\nSithrah has been a big experiment with the comic format by mixing subtle prose with comic panels. My hope is to blur the lines between comics, children's books, and novels without making it jarring for the reader. Here are a bunch of double page spreads from book 2.\nMost of my inspiration comes from the comic artists of the 90's when I refined my drawing style. Later I became influenced by Miyazaki's movies and storytelling and have been trying to make comics that have a similar depth and feeling.\nFeel free to read through my archive at Webtoons.com where I post weekly updates. I will continue to post new pages online until the full story is complete.\nSITHRAH 2 will be 160 full color pages in a hardcover book with a cloth binding. 1000 copies will have a signed and numbered bookplate. The interior pages will be printed on thick, high quality paper printed with the same care and attention to detail that I put into reMIND Volume 1 and 2. The retail price will be $24.95.\nSITHRAH 2: Propositions (160 pages)\nSITHRAH 1: Kingdom of the Air (96 pages)\nJust so you know some history of my books: The first printing of my first book, reMIND, was printed in spring of 2011 with 2500 copies that sold out in about 6 months. It got much praise from fans and won some awards and achievements including:\n2010 Xeric Grant Winner \n2012 Great Graphic Novels for Teens List (GGNT) \n2012 Selected for Arkansas State Reading list\nNovember at the latest! In other words, JUST IN TIME FOR CHRISTMAS! This will make a great Christmas present for kids and adults. :) So make sure to stock up and add lots and lots of copies as stocking stuffers.\nOkay, let me backup and explain how this will happen...\nSITHRAH 2 will be ready to go to the printer shortly after this Kickstarter ends. The printing process will take about 3 months for the proofs, printing and shipping. This means I'll probably be getting the books around September or October. I have helpers who will help me fulfill all the orders again and so we will try to get everything shipped within a month. (depending on how big this campaign gets)\nI put November as the shipping date as an absolute worst case scenario but I am estimating that the books will be in my garage by September and I will start shipping them out soon after that.\nPeople ask me why I chose to self-publish SITHRAH and reMIND. Well, when I started this my dream was to get the best agent and publisher and take the world by storm with my graphic novels. What I learned is that nobody cares about what you want to do until after you prove yourself. So I started posting pages online in 2009 to try to grow an audience and sure enough, a small group started following my progress. Later I applied for the self publisher's Xeric grant in 2010 and won $5000. This convinced me to fully commit to self-publish and it was then that I launched my first kickstarter back in 2010. To my surprise I raised over 12 thousand additional dollars to help print my first book. Then in 2012 I launched a second campaign for reMIND 2 and it raised a whopping $107,500! Although it was a crazy big campaign delivering so many books, it all worked out. Better yet, I now have a distributor for my books which was one of the biggest problems to overcome with self-publishing.\nThe funny thing is now that I have beautiful books published I am approached by publishers like I had dreamed about. I could easily sign a contract with a publisher but in being forced to self publish, I have also fallen in love with it. I can make the books exactly how I want them to look and reprint them whenever I want. I can focus on what's important to me instead of what's important to a publisher. It's a ton of work and I still have a lot to learn but overall I love self-publishing now. Thanks to Kickstarter and you guys for helping me I'll keep doing this as long as I can. :)\nMy business plan is to continue printing high quality first-printing books that are numbered, rare and sending them directly to my customers. The second and third printings will be manufactured more with mass distribution in mind.\nI hope the quality of my books are apparent as soon as you see them on the shelf and even more so when you slowly flip through the pages. My goal has always been to make a coffee table book that also happens to be a comic.\nNow lets talk about where the money will go. I plan to print 3500 copies of SITHRAH 2 in China which will reduce my costs big time.\n3500 copies = $14,000\nPlus Shipping, Fees and Taxes +$10,000 (low estimate)\nFUNDING GOAL = $24,000\nBetter yet, if we can blow past this goal then I will be able to unlock other books that are waiting to be printed. :)\nAll domestic orders will get free shipping. \nInternational orders will be charged $20 for shipping 1 book. Canada and Mexico will be charged $13 for 1 book. Multiple book tiers will be charged International shipping according to weight. I know it adds up. Sorry, there's nothing much I can do to lower the shipping costs though.\nAdd Ons are domestic only please. But if you really REALLY REALLY want to add on something to your international order then please message me and we can work out the details of how much you should pledge. :)\nJust like my past publications, I want to include some guest art in the back of the printed book. And so\u2026 ART CONTEST!!! I'm going to ask for art submissions while this campaign is live to give you a chance to get your art featured in the gallery of Sithrah: Book 2. Send me your amazing artistic version of the Sithrah characters to be printed in the book... FOREVER! I will credit you in the book too. These are the winners that were printed in Sithrah 1:\nThe page dimensions are 6.75 inches (wide) x 10.5 inches (tall). Please make sure all art is 300dpi when scanned. The deadline for submission is the closing of this campaign (May 31st at 5PM MST). Please send all submissions to J@CoffeeTableComics.com for consideration. Once this campaign is over, I will display all the entries for everyone to see and vote on their favorite. Then I'll pick the final winner(s) for the book. :)\nRemember that Kickstarter is an All-or-Nothing system. If I can't raise the full amount in the time given then I won't get anything. :(\nThanks for your support in making SITHRAH 2 the best graphic novel series it can be!\n(Now I need to run around my house to shake off this nervous feeling of running another Kickstarter. Breath. Breath. It will be okay. Okay, I'm better now.)\nI can't express in words just how much your support means to me and my family. Thank you again and again.\n- Jason", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis will be my 4th Kickstarter campaign and although I have successfully delivered all the rewards in my last campaigns I am even more prepared and confident that it will be a super smooth campaign. \n\nFor instance, before I would have 80% of my book finished, but this time I have it 100% finished and even 100% of additional books finished that might end up being stretch goals. I have people in place to help me with shipping again. Not to mention I am working full-time on comics now instead of just after I get home from work. I have gone above and beyond to deliver on all my past campaigns even to the point of getting freelance jobs to help finish paying for stretch goals that the campaign didn't fully fund. \n\nThere is always a chance that something could go horribly wrong and delays could happen but I have given myself a few extra months of buffer time if anything goes down.

It's about that season in a dad's life when he feels the responsibility of fatherhood but he's still getting comfortable with the title. The first season of the strip kicks off with the birth of Wes\u2019 son, Parker, and - together with his wife, Kari - Wes must ensure that his child thrives in a warm, loving environment with plenty of food and water. Parenthood is hard! But it\u2019s also hilarious! So at least it has THAT going for it.\nTogether, we\u2019re going to raise the funds to publish the first collection of MOLEBASHED comic strips and essays titled MOLEBASHED Season 1! The book will collect the entire first season of the comic strip (August 2015-April 2016) and feature plenty of extras, including a foreword by Michael Jantze, creator of The Norm! Not only will this be the first MOLEBASHED collection, it\u2019ll also be my first book in SIX YEARS! I\u2019m psyched!\nOne of the nice things about self-publishing the book is that it will look exactly the way I want it to: a sturdy paperback cover with a matte finish and French folds, matte interior pages, Bluetooth\u2026 OK, it won\u2019t have Bluetooth, but it\u2019s gonna be a sharp-lookin\u2019 book! Even if you never read it, your friends will be super impressed by how cool it looks on your shelf!\nFor you book nerds, here are the specs:\nDimensions: 9\" X 9\" \nCover: 135 lb text, Matte, French Folds\nInterior pages: 85 lb matte text, Full Color, Full Bleed\nPage Count: 148\nWes Molebash is a first-time father in his mid-thirties. A big kid at heart, he wants nothing more than to be a great father and an attentive husband. Though it seems he\u2019s taken to fatherhood quite naturally, don\u2019t be fooled by his calm demeanor; he\u2019s screaming on the inside.\nSIDENOTE: The Cartoon Version of Wes is about 10% more interesting and 20% thinner than Real Life Wes.\nKari Molebash is an amazing wife and mother. Not only does she work part time, but she runs the household, manages the bills, and ensures the safety of both her \u201cboys\u201d.\nSIDENOTE: The Cartoon Version of Kari is NOWHERE NEAR AS COOL as Real Life Kari.\nParker Molebash is an infant. He loves to sleep, drink milk, and spit up.\nSIDENOTE: The Cartoon Version of Parker is pretty darn accurate.\nYou want rewards? We got \u2018em! There\u2019s a whole slew of reward levels that you can scroll through on the right side of the screen. Some highlights include a copy of the book for pledging as little as $20 to the campaign, and some nice premium awards for the hardcore fans and book retailers such as original MOLEBASHED artwork, custom social media avatars, and book packs with deep discounts! So make sure to check out ALL the rewards to see which one tickles your fancy!\n\u201c'MOLEBASHED' features a reliable narrator because he\u2019s a real person. It\u2019s Wes. And Kari. And Parker. It\u2019s a window for Wes to shout from, but a mirror for the rest of us. We\u2019ve been there, are there or will be there: It\u2019s that simple.\"\n     - Michael Jantze [from the foreword] (The Norm)\n\"Wes has created that strip the internet (and the world) needs right now: a funny, loving, crazy, silly, cute, adorable strip about young people making even younger people and surviving it one day at a time. If you've been there, like me, it will bring it all back, but if you haven't yet, it will make you want to be there! Oh- and it looks like Michael Jantze's and Bill Watterson's love child - how great is that?! \"      \n     - Tom Bancroft (Disney Animation Vet, Character Designer, Webcomicker, Author, Podcaster)\n\"I don't read many webcomics. If you know that, and you know me, you might not think that I'd regularly follow a slice-of-life webcomic about a mild-mannered, church-positive couple and their baby, but you'd be dead wrong. With MOLEBASHED, Wes has created something that he very clearly cares about, and he manages to make even the most mundane task or child-friendly observation funny. And I needn't say anything about the art; Wes' style has always been a draw, and his delicious color scheme on MOLEBASHED is icing on the art cake!\"\n     - Danielle Corsetto (Girls With Slingshots)\n\"MOLEBASHED is a comic I faithfully follow, and quite honestly I don't follow a whole lot. The artist, Wes Molebash, is a down-to-earth guy who keeps his strip clean, minimal, friendly and full of heart. It's just himself, his wife and baby... and a six-color color scheme. Webcomics have mostly been dominated by fanboy gamer culture and a swarm of disenfranchised misanthropes, while MOLEBASHED represents a rising revolution that returns to the beauty of everyday slices of life in the tradition of the Sunday comics we grew up with. It has my highest recommendation.\"\n     - Matthew Paul Mewhorter (Cancer Owl)\n\"I can't think of many more occupations in life that need to be approached with a good sense of humor than being a husband and father. Wes' strip MOLEBASHED delivers all the charm and humor of raising a young family, but spares me from having to change the diapers.\"\n     - Anthony Holden (freelance story and development artist)\n\u201c\u2026 sharp artwork, wry observations on being a parent and \u2014 to my mind \u2014 incredibly true-to-life observations about the supreme comedy of raising a human.\u201d\n     - Lucas Wetzel (Laugh Tracks GoComics Blog)\n\u201c[MOLEBASHED is] a delight, warm, funny and sweet.\u201d\n     - Richard Bruton (Forbidden Planet)\nThe primary goal for this project is to raise $12,500.

For over 40 years he's been drawing the most beautiful illustrations of nature, entirely by hand. At an old drafting table he adeptly renders the mathematical brilliance of nature with just a pencil, compass, ruler and protractor.\nRafael can spend up to 100 hours on a single illustration\nIn the media\nRafael has been featured on CNN and in publications such as Wired and WWF's magazine. His illustrations have been shown at Stanford University and in major exhibitions and galleries around the world. More than 20,000 people follow his work at fb.com/rafaelaraujoart.\nRafael was a teenager when he first observed intelligent patterns in the work of nature and learned about Phi, the Golden Ratio. This ratio, represented by the Greek letter \u03d5 equals 1.618, and is commonplace in nature - from the hypnotic whorls of the chambered nautilus shell to the balanced proportions of butterfly wings.\nBlue morpho butterfly sequence\nChambered nautilus shell\nButterfly infinite sequence\nFibonacci sequence shell\n\"Phyllotaxis\" is the tendency in nature for things to grow in spiral patterns. You may have observed that sea shells, plant leaves and branches grow in spirals where the ratio of the amount of turn from one branch to the next is precisely Phi.\nGolden Ratio spiral\nRafael applies the Golden Ratio to his geometric formulas and leaves the construction lines intact to highlight this natural mathematical framework. Not surprisingly, it can take him up to 100 hours to create a single composition.\nFibonacci sequence shell\nThe Project\nRecently, many followers of Rafael's work have been asking him for prints to color. From this came the idea to create a beautiful coloring book with renditions of his best illustrations. Rafael has been working on this project since late-2015 with a Sydney-based team:\nMelinda & Andres Restrepo\nWe had been following Rafael's work for years, and like many of you, we looked forward to the day a publisher would produce a book of his amazing illustrations. One day, we took the initiative, sent him an email ... and here we are! Working with Rafael has been a pleasure and the book is finally ready to go to press.\n\nPreview\nGolden Ratio Coloring Book front cover\nGolden Ratio Coloring Book back cover\nChambered nautilus shell\nMirrored butterfly sequence\nGolden sequence\nGolden grid\nFibonacci icosahedron\nColored example\nAlhambra tiles\n  We believe this book is special. Not only for Rafael's wonderful illustrations but because it will enable all of us, regardless of our age, to disconnect from the distractions and hectic pace of our modern lives and reconnect with the calm deep within ourselves and the awesome wonder of the natural world around us.\n\nFeatures\n9.8\"x9.8\" / 25x25cm perfect bound soft cover that opens flat with detachable pages so drawings can be cleanly removed. \n20 black and white renditions of Rafael's best illustrations. 1 illustration per page to prevent issues with color bleed-through. \nPrinted on the highest quality drawing paper: acid-free, thick 270 gsm archival paper to prevent drawings from yellowing.\nSuitable for drawing with almost any coloring medium: pencil, crayon, gel pens, ink, marker, pastels, water color, and gouache.\nBudget\nKickstarter adds together reward production costs with shipping costs. Therefore, although we need AUD$11,244 (\u00b1USD$8500) to produce the book and rewards, we need to account for another AUD$11,430 (\u00b1USD$8700) for order fulfilment.

I'm Thomas, and I love making games. For the past 3 years, I've been working on Pinstripe in addition to college and my day job. Honestly, I've been trying to prove to myself that I can make an awesome game completely alone and self funded. It's been an exciting journey, but I've learned that Pinstripe is a much bigger project than originally planned.\nSo to be honest, I've been a little scared to launch a Kickstarter. But I think it's time to ask for help. I'm here to ask the Kickstarter community for support to continue and complete Pinstripe. It's not only exciting to potentially get funding from you guys, it's also exciting to get some much needed community support. \nEvery frame in Pinstripe is meticulously crafted and polished.\nBeautiful, unique, and satisfying adventure games are a bit of a rarity, and can be challenging to pull-off. But the past 3 years have been an amazing learning experience, and I like to think that Pinstripe has slowly evolved into exactly what an adventure game should be: fun, beautiful, interesting, and personal. With Kickstarter's help, the adventure of Pinstripe can be completed and released by August of 2016.\nStarts at 1:52:42\nPinstripe is a 2D adventure game about an ex-minister named Teddy who must explore Hell in search of his daughter Bo, who has been kidnapped by a strange entity claiming to be God. \nTeddy, Bo, and his puppy George.\nPinstripe features bizarre and interesting puzzles, strange monsters to shoot with your handy shotgun, and unique and lovable characters to engage with in order to advance through Hell. \nExplore a vast and freezing cold Hell.\nDiscover super weird creatures in Hell.\nSimple gameplay is the cornerstone of Pinstripe, and was the goal from the start. With simplistic and casual gameplay, the player can focus on the art, music, and story, and become immersed in the beautiful atmosphere. The goal of Pinstripe is to make you feel like a kid again without being bogged down with stuff that is confusing and unnecessarily. This is achieved by picking up the controller, running around and exploring the strange world, hanging out with funny characters, and occasionally shooting your shotgun to complete puzzles. For Pinstripe, simple gameplay makes exploring Hell super fun.\n Features:\nHighly polished, illustrative 2D graphics.\nAn emotionally charged story about fatherhood and Hell.\nA detective styled adventure. Help your dog George uncover clues about your past.\nExamine clues about your past life.\nA moody, beautiful soundtrack reminiscent of the Zelda franchise featuring piano and classical instrumentation.\nOld-school, simplistic platforming and character interaction. \nStrange and challenging on-screen puzzles.\n6 strange and elegantly designed worlds (forest, train, cave, canyon, lake, and cliff!)\nThat wonderful feeling of adventure and exploration you used to get when you played games like King's Quest, Myst, and The Legend of Zelda.\nPinstripe was Greenlit in just 7 days!\nSometimes the characters in Pinstripe are extra weird, like this crotchety old tree.\nPinstripe has already received some awesome awards nominations and honors at IndieCade's E3 Showcase, Whippering Indie Cup in San Francisco, and Reboot 2015, and most recently, at SXSW 2016. However, it's nowhere near where it needs to be for release. \nI've been making games for almost 10 years now. My two most recent games, Coma and Skinny, became viral online hits and won several awards from companies like Indie Pub, Mochi, and Newgrounds. Although they were much shorter and less ambitious than Pinstripe, I like to think that all of my games have a similar heart and style.\nPlay Coma!\nPlay Skinny!\nPinstripe is about 60% complete. However, the remaining 40% is looking more and more daunting as I continue to work on this project. As many of you know, the older you get, the less time you have. When I was in college, I had plenty of time to mess around with this project on a daily basis. Unfortunately, this is not the case for me and my family.\nI need your help to be able to quit freelancing, and focus specifically on Pinstripe. With a serious jolt from the Kickstarter community, Pinstripe will be exactly where it needs to be by August of 2016.\nBefore Pinstripe, Coma and Skinny received multiple awards for their distinct and atmospheric soundtracks. Pinstripe's soundtrack is no different. It is beautiful and reminiscent of the Zelda franchise, and plays a key role in the game's mood and story. This is one of Pinstripe's strong suites. Pinstripe is a unique in that the entire experience, from the visuals to the music, is intentionally crafted by one individual, resulting in one cohesive piece of art. Feel free to take a listen to some of the songs written for Pinstripe so far:\nBut the soundtrack isn't perfect. It still needs a ton of work.\nI finally decided it was time for Kickstarter because I knew keeping this game alive and seeing it finished the right way would be extremely difficult without help from the Kickstarter community. \nUltimately, I need to focus on this game full-time, otherwise, it's going to be extremely difficult to finish. I need funds to pay for the game's production and also make up for the loss of funding due to quitting my day job. Feel free to see the budget below.\nAdditionally, your feedback and criticism is crucial. Seeing a project for what it is can be difficult without a community's involvement. I really just want to make a game you love, and I'm 100% positive I can do that with your help. If you don't love it, I want to know why and how I can make it better. \nWith your help, a beta build will be ready for testing by May of 2016, and the final build on Steam by August of 2016. By then, Pinstripe will be available on Steam for Mac, PC, and Linux, all because of you guys.\nThe budget above is only an estimation, and is subject to change.\nProfessional Advisory Board\nWithout these people and their incredible industry-specific input, Pinstripe would not be what it is today.\nKickstarter Shoutout #2: Go Check Out \"Knights & Bikes\"!\nCheck out Knights & Bikes!\nGo check out \"A Place for the Unwilling\"! It's a very interesting adventure game set in a living city filled with secrets to unveil. An open world inspired by Majora's Mask and Sunless Sea! Check it out!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nDeveloping games is hard. Developing games alone is even harder. But I have 10 years of experience and have released 3 games prior to Pinstripe. I also have the support of an incredible advisory board. Ultimately, it can take a long time to develop a game alone, and a lot can go wrong from start to finish. But this game is not at the start, it has already been heavily worked on for years and with your help it will launch this summer.\n\nAnother concern is story: what makes Pinstripe special is a unique story surrounded by beautiful visuals and music. Pinstripe's story is written, but it is not implemented. I'm concerned that, although the story looks great on paper, it will not translate well in the actual game. To overcome this, I have a team of professional advisors who are very close to me, who will play the game and be sure to highlight any areas where the story just isn't working. This will be a fluid, on-going process, and will allow me to address the issues as they come, rather than after the game is released.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #73", "update_userinfo": "Get a FREE game if you back my buddy's project within the next 7 days!", "update_content": "My indie dev buddy Maxime has launched a Kickstarter for his cyberpunk first-person adventure game, and I wanted to let you know about.

As this is a community inspired project we would love to hear your ideas and suggestions for improvements in the comments section. \nDon't forget you can follow us on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Tumblr for art inspiration and resources when you need them!\nThanks again everyone!\nHello and thank you for checking out our project! 100 Hours is an exciting new idea to make exclusive high-quality, diverse and insightful art-based video training affordable and accessible to everyone. \nWe have taken on the huge task of collaborating with 100 renowned artists from a wide range of artistic fields and styles, covering everything from traditional illustration to 3D modelling and concept art to traditional sculpture. By backing this project you will help us to give you the opportunity to gain an insight into the working practices of some of your favourite artists, discover new techniques, and learn new skills from some of the most talented and popular creative minds in the world.\nWe have joined forces with a vast assortment of artists and have recruited them to help us make 100 hours of video training which we will make available for an affordable one-off price of \u00a318 (US$25). The beauty of 100 Hours is that there is no subscription required. By backing this project, you will be able to access an amazing 100 hours\u2019 worth of art tutorials, which you can download and watch over and over again. \nIf you back this campaign you will be given a unique login and password that will allow you to stream videos from the 100 Hours website on to your computer, phone or tablet. You can download content too and take it with you wherever you go. We are also going to make a DVD boxset of all 100 videos available for \u00a350 (US$70).     \nThe 100 Hours website will run for 2 years from its launch. During this time you will also be able to stream and watch videos as well as download them. Why 2 years? We thought 2 years would offer everyone a good amount of time to be able to download the videos to keep forever. Our goal is to continue to add to and improve this project, so in the future we would like to re-launch this concept with new artists, new training videos, and demonstrate new skills and techniques.\nGetting so many great artists to create a good-quality hour-long video is a significant undertaking, which is why we have decided to launch this project on Kickstarter. All the artists involved will be paid an amount that reflects the success of this campaign once it has been funded, which will enable them to create video content ready for us to edit and produce.    \nBy funding this project you are not only benefiting from the knowledge of 100 incredible artists, you are also supporting the community that both you and we love.\nTutorial topics are subject to change and the images used above are just representative of the artists work, they are not an image taken from the artists training videos.\n        Abigail Larson, Ahmed Aldoori, Ahmed Rawi, Aleksandr Nikonov, Alessandra Fusi, Alessandro Baldasseroni, Alex Negrea, Ania Tomicka, Anna Dittmann, Bastien Lecouffe Deharme, Bobby Rebholz, Brian Kesinger, Cesar Zambelli, Charlie Bowater, Christophe Desse, Chris Gillett, Clint Cearley, Cory Godbey, Cris Delara, Daarken, Damien Mammoliti, Daniel Crossland, Darren Bartley, Denis Zilber, Eduardo Vieira, Erica Calardo, Fawn Veerasunthorn, Faye Halliday, Frida Lundqvist, Gabriel Soares, Gareth Davies, Glauco Longhi, Glen Southern, Genzoman, Henning Sanden, Ignacio Bazan Lazcano, Ilya Kuvshinov, Ioan Dumitrescu, J.C.

This is the same spark that the Greek Titan Prometheus stole to give fire to man. She thought maybe the Spark of the Sun could warm the undead hearts of her father, mother, and her younger brother.\n\nThis uplifting story of compassion and love comes from my friends and family, who sacrifice themselves for others. Whether it's serving the homeless, making clothes, knitting, cleaning, counseling, or protecting children. I see all around me people who live lives like this. Risking their very selves to warm the hearts of others. \nEveryone deserves to feel warm in their heart. Everyone deserves fire.\nHow can you help?\nYou can back Little Prometheus at any level that fits you.\nAnd share it everywhere. I believe that a Kickstarter only grows and reaches others because of you. There is no better marketing than word-of-mouth.\nWe are in a new era of book making that allows stories to be created without publishers.

Why do they have to adapt to notebooks instead of notebooks adapting to their type of work? What if a single reusable notebook could suit everyone's specific needs? We asked ourselves these questions, and we've come to Kickstarter with the answer: a modular notebook designed to suit you.\nApparently, it is a normal notebook, but never judge a 'notebook' by its cover. The Mixiw Notebook is an innovative notebook concept that allows you to customize its content according to your own needs. It has a new binding system in which booklets can be removed, rearranged or combined easily, quickly and conveniently depending on the situation. The notebook can carry up to 5 booklets of up to 40 pages each (200 pages in total). There are dozens of different booklets to choose from. Whether you need a planner, a diary or to-dos to better organise and be more productive; or specific papers for fountain pens, drawing or painting to express your creativity; or technical content (millimeter paper, vectors, web and app design...), the Mixiw Notebook suits you.\nAnd what are you going to do when you run out of pages? Don\u2019t worry, the Mixiw Notebook is refillable. Once you've filled a booklet, you'll only have to change it for a new one. Also, you can keep filled booklets in the Mixiw Album: a filing system where you can store up to 20 booklets and be able to go back to them easily.\nMixiw's quality hardcover ensures a long lifetime for a versatile and infinite notebook that changes and evolves at the same time you do.\nBinding system\nThe Mixiw Notebook covers have elastic hooks on the upper and lower part of the spine which allow you to remove and reattach the 5 booklets. The new binding system allows adaptability with a compact design. Removing a booklet is as easy as opening it from the middle and moving it up and down to separate it from the cover. Adding a booklet is equally fast and simple. You won't waste any time adapting the content to your needs like you would do with bulky ring binders. Do more with less with Mixiw, a simple, elegant and free of distractions notebook that helps increase your productivity. The hooks will securely hold the booklets so that they do not fall by accident.\nLast but not least, Mixiw's new binding system allows the notebook to lay flat (180\u00ba).\nPLAY\n\nThe Mixiw Notebook comes with a sticky pocket. We know that not everyone use it, so we let you choose if you want to stick it on the interior cover or not. Once it\u2019s sticked it can\u2019t be removed.\nThe Mixiw Notebook has a hard cover made of high quality vinyl-coated to guarantee a long lasting life. A durable cover to store many notebook cycles.\nThe interior cover of Mixiw is made of fabric with a layer of Teflon\u00ae.\nBoth covers are nonstick to prevent stains. You won't have to worry anymore about coffee splatters.\nInitially, these are the available colors: black, green and white. The covers are nonstick to prevent stains. You won't need to worry anymore about coffee splatters.\nFor the filled booklets you want to keep, you can use the Mixiw Album, which can hold up to 20 booklets. It\u2019s a great way to have all your notebook stories organised and accessible. The Mixiw Album has 20 elastic bands around the spine which allow you to attach and remove booklets.\nIt's a simple and elegant solution to store and keep your old booklets on your bookshelf.\nThe booklets are staple bound.\nThe Mixiw Notebook offers different paper types for different needs:\nMulti purpose (90g/m2). The perfect paper for everyday uses. All the layouts are printed with this paper.\nFountain pen friendly and illustration (~120g/m2). Ideal if you work with ink.\nWatercolor paper (~210g/m2). Ideal for watercolor painting.\nAll the paper we use comes from responsibly managed forests, certified by FSC (Forest Stewardship Council). This means that the whole process from extracting the wood to the processing of the paper is done with environmentally friendly criteria that ensures forest regeneration. Also, all of our papers are acid-free.\n A reinvented notebook. Designed with the user in mind to break with the limitations of other notebooks and to give you the freedom you always wanted.\nElegant and simple design. Beautiful compact notebook with a new binding system. More practical, easier and faster to use than other \u201csolutions\u201d.\nMultifunctional. Planner, journal, sketchbook, storyboard, web/app design... The Mixiw Notebook is whatever you want it to be. More than 20 rearrangeable booklet types to choose from and many more to come.\nCustomise it to your needs. Rearrange and combine booklets to suit your needs at any given time.\nRefillable. Forget about throwaway notebooks. There's no need to change the whole notebook everytime it runs out of pages. Mixiw can be used over and over again.\nQuality paper. Different paper types for different needs: multi purpose, fountain pen friendly and watercolor paper. All of them long-lasting and acid-free.\nLays flat (180\u00ba). All 5 booklets open flat for a better experience.\nUp to 200 pages (5 booklets of 40 pages each). You choose how to fill them.\nSticky pocket. We know that not everyone wants a back pocket, so we let you stick it only if you need it.\nKeepsake. Keep your filled booklets organised in the Album and look them up like a book. - For everyone. Designed to suit everyone\u2019s needs.\nIMPROVE YOURSELF\nDo more with less. Why having one notebook for each one of your needs? 5 rearrangeable booklets of your choice in one single notebook. \nGet focused. The notebook pile is over, with Mixiw you only have to focus on a single notebook for all your needs.\nBe organised. Unclutter. Forget about having a chaotic notebook with messy notes. Use each booklet for a different purpose.\nBe productive. Get things done without distractions. You can go through the booklets more quickly than loose-leafs, or use the bookmarks to go straight to a specific page.\nBe creative. Use layouts to focus on what you create.\nEXTRAS\nCool stuff to be unlocked. Amazing and innovative Stretch Goals that focus on user experience. \nEver evolving. We'll listen to your suggestions to constantly improve the Mixiw experience.\nExclusive online Store for backers. After the Kickstarter campaign, the store will be available to Mixiw backers before anyone else.\n CUSTOMIZING REWARDS \nWe'll do that through an online store on Mixiw Notebooks website. At the end of the campaign, if it is successful, exclusive access to our online store will be granted to all the backers with a physical reward. There you will be able to select from the different reward options and to process shipment. We've decided to do it this way because it allows us to provide different benefits: \nSimplify customization. Once you access the online store you'll see all your rewards and you'll be able to select the size of your Mixiw Notebook, cover color, booklets, and size of the Mixiw Album. \nAllow you to increase rewards. Once you've selected your reward you'll be able to include more booklets and Mixiw Albums, which will have to be paid separately from this campaign, directly on the online store.\nProvide long-term service to backers. After we've sent you the rewards, the store will be online permanently to allow the acquisition of new booklets and filling systems. \nWe do not know yet when the online store will be accessible to the general public. We only know that it will be after we've sent each and every one of the rewards to the backers.\nWe think that Mixiw\u2019s adaptability and customization solve several limitations of present notebooks and open new possibilities for everyone. But innovation has its costs. In our case, manufacturing a notebook with a new binding system that breaks industry standards isn\u2019t a cheap task to accomplish. That\u2019s why we need a large order of Mixiw notebooks to obtain a good price from the manufacturers. \nWith this in mind, we think that crowdfunding is the best way to launch the Mixiw Notebook. First of all, it gives us the opportunity to validate Mixiw and to know if there are people interested in it. Secondly, backers can help make Mixiw a reality while they are rewarded for it. Last but not least, a crowdfunding campaign is the beginning of something that we find crucial, the founding of a community formed by the people who believe a better notebook is possible.\nFrom all the crowdfunding sites, we have chosen Kickstarter to fundraise Mixiw because it has an experienced audience in supporting innovative concepts that solve everyday problems. We want to learn from the knowledge of Kickstarter users and listen to their suggestions about Mixiw. \nWe strongly believe that Kickstarter will help us to connect with notebook lovers around the world to make the Mixiw Notebook a reality.\n If you like this new notebook concept, help us to get to as many people as possible. And together, we can make the Mixiw Notebook a reality. Share this project through your social networks and with everybody you think might be interested in it. Every bit of help will be very useful ;)\nOur dream is that you have the option to customize a notebook that evolves and adapts constantly to your needs so that you don't have to adapt to a generic notebook. We know this is a great challenge and that\u2019s why we want it to be a long term project. We hope this campaign is not the end but the beginning of a new way of understanding notebooks. \nOnce we'll have sent all the Mixiw notebooks to everybody who will have participated in this campaign, our commitment is to keep the online store open for all of you. We cannot specify when exactly we'll open the store to the general public, but we do promise to provide refills to all the backers that have a Mixiw Notebook so that you'll never run out of pages.\nTaking this responsibility, we want to go further than the normal notebook concept. We believe that Mixiw's binding system opens a variety of possibilities that we want to research and develop. We want Mixiw to be more than a personal adaptive tool to create, discover, share, organize, learn\u2026 We have many innovative ideas centered on what we consider to be the fundamental pilar of Mixiw, its users.\nOur dream is not only to create an awesome notebook that suits everyone's needs, but to build an open project for notebook lovers. A community where you can participate and create. We want to listen to Mixiw's users to know their suggestions about new features, new layout, and even more\u2026 This is our commitment for the future: to be constantly improving the Mixiw experience, always by your side.\nPLAY\n\nMy name is Arnau Aloy, I am a graphic designer and a passionate lover of notebooks and organizers. I think that, despite digital tools being very useful, nothing gives you the freedom to create, capture ideas and express yourself without distractions as a paper notebook. Nonetheless, I've always thought notebooks had limitations and I had never found any that suited my ever changing needs. Most of them were designed to cover concrete uses and the very few that allowed customization of content had mechanisms with very little usability. So I always ended up using one for each of my needs. This way I had my ideas, designs, agendas... scattered around different notebooks, and that was preventing me from being more organized, productive and creative.\nThe search for a notebook that would adapt to my needs was for me a chimera. I thought I was the only one with this problem, but I discovered many people had the same difficulty. Some of them talked about the piles of notebooks they had accumulated over the years, most of them were not completely full and some others were not even used. I thought the image of the piles of notebooks was perfect proof of the problem many users had to find a notebook that was simple, elegant, durable and versatile.\nSo I decided to design myself the versatile notebook I had always wanted but never found. To do that I found inspiration on the adaptability and long life of the ring binders, and the usability and the capacity to use the double page of the book-like notebooks. A year and a half ago I designed the first Mixiw prototype with a new binding system. I showed it to many notebook users to get first impressions and opinions. One of them fell in love with it, my friend Marc Prat, who got involved in the project. Together we worked on improving the notebook and defining the Mixiw experience we wanted the users to enjoy.\nAfter many other prototypes, when we had the definitive notebook, we believed we needed to reach as many notebook lovers as possible to be able to make the Mixiw Notebook a reality. And we thought the best way to do that was by launching a Kickstarter campaign. And so here you have it, made with the head and the heart, with you in mind. We hope you like it as much as we do and that we can go on working together in this project.\nWe are Arnau Aloy and Marc Prat, friends since we were little kids. We love everything related to creativity and the creative process. This is why we've always loved notebooks. We've designed the Mixiw Notebook to be a versatile tool which helps people to be more productive, organised and creative. We want to listen to your suggestions because we believe you are a fundamental pilar of this new notebook concept, and together we can make it a reality.\nArnau\u2019s Mixiw combo: A5 with Agenda, Millimeter paper, To-do's, Blank paper, Monthly Planner\nMarc\u2019s Mixiw combo: A5 with Weekly Planner, To-do list, Dot Grid, Blank paper and Storyboard.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe greatest challenge we have is the complexity of order fulfillment due to the amazing degree of customization of the notebook for each backer. We\u2019ll commit our time to ensure that every backer receives exactly the desired notebook. \n\nOn the other hand, the production of the Mixiw Notebook is also complex because it has elements from various suppliers and it means a technical challenge for binding companies. Machinery in use nowadays does not allow for the complete automatisation of the production process of our covers and so some manual procedures must be included.\nLuckily, the companies which will participate in the production of the Mixiw Notebook have shown their interest and willingness to participate in this innovative project.

We intend to publish these almost entirely never-before-seen strips from his teenage years in a definitive edition which will highlight the first origins of one of the forefathers of modern cartooning. And we can't do it without you.  \nWill Eisner's THE SPIRIT, the series which would become his calling card.\nNo Longer Lost: The Getsinger Find\nWhen the New Jersey artist and antique collector Joseph Getsinger acquired an enormous, 10,000-piece collection of 1930s-era cartoon printing plates, he had no idea what riches it contained -- just a hunch that there might be some diamonds in the rough. During his research, he became fascinated with two strips in particular: UNCLE OTTO by one \"Carl Heck\" and HARRY KARRY, credited to an unknown artist named \"Willis B. Rensie.\"\nSome of Getsinger's printing plate score.\nAs Joe began to investigate the provenance of this massive collection, he found that it was linked to Empire Features, a company that provided printing plates to various newspapers for syndication. Eisner & Iger Studios -- the partnership between the very young Jerry Iger and Will Eisner to distribute and publish their many fledgling comic books, strips, and magazines -- was one of Empire Features' many customers.\nGetsinger's Heck/Rensie/Eisner printing plates.\nOne day shortly after becoming aware of this connection, Getsinger was looking at a reverse-printed HARRY KARRY plate and it came to him in a flash: \"Rensie\" was Eisner spelled backwards. He suddenly knew that what he had here was of extraordinary historical value.\nLater work by Will Eisner.\nThe Lost Work: UNCLE OTTO & HARRY KARRY\nUNCLE OTTO and HARRY KARRY, it turns out, represent the earliest known sequential artwork of Will Eisner -- and until now, apart from their titles and a very small smattering of strips salvaged from the few local newspapers that intermittently published them, their contents were almost completely unknown.\nUncle Otto by Carl Heck, a.k.a. young Will Eisner\nIn these 100 early strips you can see Eisner's imagination expanding, as he experiments with the possibilities of serialized storytelling and works through his many influences, finally emerging with a close approximation of the style that brought him success and fame with THE SPIRIT in 1940.\nIn its ninth strip, HARRY KARRY shifts suddenly toward the SPIRIT spectrum.\nWe want to publish this important document of the genesis of one of the most influential and brilliant cartoonists of all time. With your help, we can.\nWill Eisner's THE SPIRIT would build on the action and comedy of his cartooning in HARRY KARRY and UNCLE OTTO.\nThis is the first in a planned series of archival projects from Locust Moon Press, in which we intend to salvage vital pieces of comics and art history from the sands of time. We hope that you'll help us in this effort to create a more complete history of the artwork of Will Eisner, and to provide a window into the creative process and self-invention of a genius.\nHARRY KARRY by Willis B. Rensie, a.k.a. Will Eisner.\n ABOUT WILL EISNER\n\nWill Eisner, caled by Wizard Magazine \"the most influential comic artist of all time,\" is one of the foundational figures in the history of comics. In a career that spanned eight decades, he devised an entirely new cartooning language, created hundreds of unforgettable characters, pioneered the concept of the graphic novel, and reinvented his chosen medium.\n\nHe is the author of THE SPIRIT, which ran from 1940-1952, the early graphic novels A CONTRACT WITH GOD, A LIFE FORCE, DROPSIE AVENUE and THE DREAMER, as well as works on comic theory such as COMICS ND SEQUENTIAL ART and GRAPHIC STORYTELLING AND VISUAL NARRATIVE.\n\nHe is the namesake of the comics industry's highest award, the Eisner Award.\n\nMore information can be found at willeisner.com.\n\nNEW REWARD UPDATE!!\nA print of this beautiful Eisner portrait by the Philadelphia artist and University of Pennsylvania cartooning professor Robert Berry is now available, as either a stand-alone reward or with a book!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe are well-prepared to undertake this project.

Join us in this adventure as we prepare to bring Dragon's Lair to a new generation. \nWe\u2019ve worked on '20' successful animation motion pictures, some of them \u201ciconic\u201d, The Secret of NIMH, An American Tail, The Land Before Time, All Dogs Go To Heaven and Anastasia to name a few.'\nIt\u2019s ironic that the project that has given us the greatest recognition is actually that video arcade game known as Dragon\u2019s Lair, created back in the early 1980s. The game has an extremely loyal fan base - now estimated to be in the millions and with each generation it has picked up even more fans. And after 30 years, the game continues to sell as an app for smart phones, smart tablets and personal computers. Fans have been begging us to do a major motion picture. Just like Dirk the Daring, a character that just won\u2019t die, the game marches on - it\u2019s time to make the movie!\"\nWe have many great rewards in store for you including, Digital Downloads, Blu-rays, DVDs, Original Signed books and Artwork, maquette's, Lapel Pins, signed posters, T-Shirts, Lanyards, and even a dinner with Don & Gary! Explore all our awards and perks and thank you for coming to our Kickstarter crowd-funding campaign. \n\"Lead on, adventurer. Your quest awaits!\"\n Animated motion pictures cost loads of money and time. If you have followed the latest publicity on animated films or checked out boxofficemojo.com you would know that these films, traditional hand-drawn or computer generated can cost anywhere from $55 million to $240 Million, some even more - just on the production. Promoting an animated film could cost an additional $100 Million to market the film worldwide. In order to finance the production, promotion and distribution, independent companies like Don Bluth Films must approach major film studios, private investors, or investment banks for loans and/or equity investment to finance their films. Though those entities may fulfill an important role in the process, their involvement also comes with serious strings attached, which can often push and/or pull the story and its design elements, in the wrong direction or even decide to cancel the production all together. Or, they may have no experience whatsoever with either the animation production process or the extraordinary marketing effort to create audience awareness and strong anticipation to see the final product. Thankfully alternatives have emerged and are gaining momentum over recent years.\n \"Crowd-sourcing\u201d or \u201cCrowd-funding\u201d sites like Kickstarter have been an incredible source of funding for independent filmmakers and game developers - by allowing consumers to support the products they would like to see developed and give the creative developers the freedom to experiment, design and take risks without others compromising the vision. \nBluth Group Ltd was established in 1983 for the production of Dragon\u2019s Lair, the arcade video game. It is the owner of the character copyrights, the Trademark for the title, and most importantly the film rights.\n Rewards\n(This experience is being offered for all backers pledging $15 or more.)

We started this crowd funding campaign to create a great entertaining video-pitch to excite serious animation film investors and distributors to finance and bring Dragon\u2019s Lair : The Movie to audiences around the world!\nWith great appreciation,\nDon Bluth & Gary Goldman\nDon Bluth Films, Inc.\nFounded in 2000 by animation industry veterans Don Bluth & Gary Goldman (some of favorites are - The Secret of NIMH, An American Tail, The Land Before Time, All Dogs Go To Heaven, Anastasia and video arcade games - Dragon\u2019s Lair and Space Ace) the Phoenix Arizona based company has been wrestling with creating Dragon\u2019s Lair: The Movie based on their popular hit video game Dragon\u2019s Lair (1983). It is to be a \u201cprequel\u201d to the game and the backstory story of Dirk the Daring, a knight, a bungling hero, an everyman - if you will, for a feature-length theatrical film. Constantly dodging promises of faulty finance approaches from various wannabes, and avoiding giving away ownership, we are considering what so many colleagues and fans have challenged us to do. So, after so many of you have screamed to us - \u201cGo to Kickstarter and get this dream off the shelf!\u201d. This time you who contribute will be allowed to observe the process as if you were there\u2026\u2019cause\u2026well, you will be there - albeit digitally speaking.\nCheck out our latest interview on TraditionalAnimation.com talking about our careers in animation and Dragon's Lair: The Movie!\nSchedule\nOver a 21 week work schedule a small team of A-list script writers and artists, under Don & Gary\u2019s supervision, Don Bluth Films will develop a unique teaser presentation incorporating a section of the script with recorded dialogues, storyboards, some animation and color art direction, giving the viewer a sample of the story, character personalities delivering an entertaining experience to create a \u201cwant to see\u201d reaction. A presentation which will encourage investors to provide financing of our budgeted 70 million dollars for us to produce Dragon\u2019s Lair : The Movie. Don Bluth Films, Inc. will be video-documenting the creative process and showing updates exclusively for the Kickstarter backers.

I'm Lois van Baarle, sometimes better known as Loish! I'm a digital artist and animator from the Netherlands. I make my living as a freelance artist but what I love to do most is make my own digital paintings and artwork, which you can find on my website, loish.net.\nPLAY\n\nOver the years, I've gradually gained an amazing fan base who have given me so much support as my artwork and career developed into what it is today. I've regularly been asked whether there is an art book featuring my work, and I've had plans to make one for the last three years. I've researched different options and given a lot of thought into what I'd like to include in the book. With the help 3dtotal Publishing's expertise in digital art books and Kickstarter, I hope to create a book that not only showcases my art but gives a detailed behind-the-scenes look at how I create my work.\nTo make sure I can offer something special in return for supporting this project, I'm coupling the book with signed art prints and commission slots. I'm also hoping to share some of my knowledge by offering downloadable video tutorials, extensive portfolio reviews and feedback, and livestream sessions as some of the pledge options. I hope that there is something for everyone who is interested in digital art and my work!\nA mock-up of the Art of Loish book\n \"Loish is an exceptional artist apart from any derivative -- her imagery comes from a place full of originality and vibrancy\"  (Tran Nguyen, Illustrator)\nAs the project was funded so quickly (thanks so much again everyone!), 3dtotal Publishing and I have come up with some stretch goals to give you some extra rewards if we reach certain targets. We hope you like them!\nPlease note that these images are just mock-ups so the design is subject to change. The playing cards will feature 52 different images!\nThe book will of course feature images of my art, particularly my illustrations, and show my progress from someone who drew digitally as a hobby to a professional freelance artist. It will feature tips and insights, and show the process of creating my work, from initial idea and sketch to finished piece. You'll find images that range from finished digital paintings to rough sketches, studies, sketchbook pages and client work. I hope that you will find it inspiring, insightful, and most importantly, enjoyable to read through!\nMore specifically, the book will include a visual timeline of my artistic journey, with a selection of remakes of past works to show how my work has evolved over the years. I will also discuss my approaches to illustration, sketching, concept art and storyboarding. In addition to all of this I would love to be able to share some never-before-seen work and provide written tutorials and tips for fellow digital artists. \nI have been working on this project for a while and have already completed the cover art and new illustrations for the book, as well as a detailed plan for the various chapters. The lovely people at 3dtotal Publishing have already agreed to produce the book and are helping to launch the project on Kickstarter. All I need now is a bit of help from you guys to make this project happen! Please consider backing this project!\nIn terms of specifications, the book will measure 255 x 255mm in size and will be presented in a craft paper slipcase with a cutout. At 152 pages, the book will also be personally signed by me with a numbered certificate inside.\nPlease note: some of these pledge options have conditions attached which are detailed below! \n#1 A downloadable video tutorial\n...................................................................................................................\n#2 A signed copy of the book with a numbered certificate fixed inside, so you have proof that you helped make this book happen!\n...................................................................................................................\n#3 A copy of the book with a numbered certificate fixed inside, so you have proof that you helped make this book happen + one downloadable video tutorial\n...................................................................................................................\n#4 A signed copy of the book with a numbered certificate fixed inside + two downloadable video tutorials detailing the creation of a character illustration and a digital painting.\n...................................................................................................................\n#5 A copy of the book with a numbered certificate fixed inside + two downloadable video tutorials detailing the creation of a character illustration and a digital painting.\n...................................................................................................................\n#6 A signed copy of the book with a numbered certificate fixed inside + two downloadable video tutorials + a signed A4 print of an original artwork created for the book.\n...................................................................................................................\n#7 A copy of the book with a numbered certificate fixed inside + two downloadable video tutorials + an A4 print of an original artwork created for the book.\n...................................................................................................................\n#8 A signed copy of the book with a numbered certificate fixed inside + two downloadable video tutorials + a signed A4 print of an original artwork created for the book + a rough digital character bust commission (completed by 5 December 2015) in which you can request any character you like.\n...................................................................................................................\n#9 A signed copy of the book with a numbered certificate fixed inside + two downloadable video tutorials + a signed A4 print of an original artwork created for the book + a portfolio review, where you can send your portfolio and get personalized tips, advice, suggestions and a constructive review of your portfolio, plus answers to any and all questions you may have.\n...................................................................................................................\n#10 A signed copy of the book with a numbered certificate fixed inside + two downloadable video tutorials + a signed A4 print of an original artwork created for the book + a rough digital full-body character commission (completed by 5 December 2015) in which you can request any character you like.\n...................................................................................................................\n#11 A signed copy of the book with a numbered certificate fixed inside + two downloadable video tutorials + a signed A4 print of an original artwork created for the book + a signed full-body sketch commission (completed by 5 December 2015), the original copy of which will be sent to you on paper.\n...................................................................................................................\n#12 A signed copy of the book with a numbered certificate fixed inside + two downloadable video tutorials + a signed A4 print of an original artwork created for the book + a rough character bust commission created in an exclusive livestream session (completed by 5 December 2015), in which any character you request is drawn in a live stream, where you can ask any questions you may have, provide instructions for the commission, and watch it being drawn live.\nOverview of the different types of commissions\nOverview of the video tutorials\nHere's some extra information about the downloadable video tutorials to give you a bit more of an idea of what to expect. The video that comes with the \u00a35 tier will be video 1.\n\nVideo 1: This tutorial will run you through the process of creating a rough character sketch - the type of sketch I often make for my clients when working on character concepts. Starting with the rough sketch, it will show you how to choose colors for the sketch, add details and shading effects, and adjustments throughout the process. Basically, it will show you how to make a dynamic and colorful illustration with the detail and personality needed to convey a character in a time-effective way.\n\nVideo 2: This tutorial will show my process for creating a digitally painted character illustration based on one of my older pieces - basically, a re-make. I'll talk about the older illustration and the points I would like to improve in my revised version, and show you my process for drawing the characters, as well as give pointers on digital painting, backgrounds, and everything you need to create a finished character portrait.\n\nFor backers of the \u00a380, \u00a3130, \u00a3250, and \u00a3440 tiers: Backers must deliver their instructions for their commission and any reference material within 10 days of Kickstarter closing. Please specify whether you are happy with the commissioned work being posted online when it is finished. A credit line can be added to commissioned images shown if desired.\nDigital commissions are usually delivered in a digital file upon completion. If you wish to receive an A4 sized print of your commission, please state this in your initial instructions!

Please note that we can only reship an order once if it is lost. If the second parcel is lost, we will not be able to offer a refund.\nI\u2019ve set aside time in my schedule to get the book done on time, with a detailed week-to-week plan to ensure that the deadline is met. I also put aside some time to work on the backer prizes, especially the commissions. It is the first time in a long time that I am able to accept commissions and I'm very excited to do these!\nI'm new to the world of publishing and this will be my first artbook, and Kickstarter feels like the best solution to finanance and create this book. Not only that but at the same time, it gives me the opportunity to open commission slots and make some detailed tutorials, something that I've wanted to do for a long time!\nWorking with an independent publisher that specialises in digital art books means that I'm making my book with people who understand my work, and most importantly, know what they're doing. It's really important to me to make a book that reflects who I am as an artist and is produced by professionals with experience, not only in publishing but also with crowdfunded art projects (for example the Sketch Workshop and female anatomy figure campaigns). Together with 3dtotal Publishing, I'm confident that this project will succeed!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe main challenge of this project is timescale. Good planning and sufficient time is needed to put together this book as well as provide you guys with great backer prizes!

This will allow 3dtotal Publishing to commence work on the book immediately if the funding goal is reached.

THANKS AQUE-FANS!!!\nPLAY\n\nIt\u2019s been a long, long time since I've released a new album and I\u2019m absolutely ecstatic to be releasing Wild Knights this July. Throughout the years I\u2019ve been honored by the sea of patient Aqueduct fans and want to sincerely thank them for their encouragement, loyalty & support.  A lot's changed since 2007's Or Give Me Death\u2026The music industry has changed, the world's changed, I've changed. This album reflects a great journey for me and its release coincides with a path of tremendous personal strength, hard work and all the ups & downs along the way.  Being able to share this music and my message with the world means all the more to me as I take the helm for this release; full steam ahead. \nI am especially excited to announce that I will be pressing Aqueduct on vinyl for the first time, another major milestone around the Wild Knights release! In the past, Aque-vinyl has been a sorely missed platform, for both myself and fans alike.  As I'm self-releasing this album, there was never a doubt or hesitation over a vinyl option when the idea was discussed in the early stages of Wild Knights.  In fact, I'm ready for all Aqueduct albums to be immortalized on wax!\nABOUT THE AQUEDUCT VINYL PROJECT \nMy aim with this Kickstarter campaign is to fund the Aqueduct Vinyl Project and reissue all my past albums for the first time on vinyl. The Wild Knights record is already underway; vinyl is ordered, paid for, and nearly finished in production, so I'm fortunate to have gotten a jump on the vinyl project. Up next, fans can expect the reissue of I Sold Gold pressed on vinyl.  This album is celebrating its 10-yr anniversary this year and is only fitting to celebrate with a deluxe vinyl release.  This record will be beautiful; 180 gram vinyl with extra fancy, spare-no-expense, extra special packaging.   \nBelow is an overview of my schedule for the upcoming Aqueduct Vinyl Project: \nWild Knights vinyl - available July 2015 - PREORDER NOW! \nI Sold Gold vinyl reissue - expected Sept/Oct 2015 \nPower Ballads vinyl reissue - planned for Spring 2016 \nPistols At Dawn 10\u201d reissue - Spring/Summer 2016\nPressing vinyl is a lengthy and costly process.  The I Sold Gold reissue is already underway in the initial planning stages of production but needs your support to complete manufacturing.  The goal is to unleash this reissue in late Sept/Oct. of this year, followed by my first album Power Ballads early in 2016. Based on the success of this campaign and if the budget allows, a custom packaged Pistols At Dawn 10\" record will not be far behind, completing the back catalog of vinyl reissues.\nABOUT WILD KNIGHTS \nFor the past year and a half I've been diligently working away on Wild Knights.  Writing, rewriting, adding, experimenting, deleting, recording at home, traveling back and forth between Seattle and Denton, Texas to work with longtime collaborator/producer/drummer Matt Pence.  We finished mixing the album in January and I immediately went into the studio and mastered Wild Knights back in Seattle in late February.\nexcerpt from Wild Knights bio:\nFrom the opening bars of \u201cThe Petrified Forest\u201d the anxiety that permeates Wild Knights is palpable. Rapid heartbeat bass, ominous synthesizer, a punch and a whisper; Aqueduct sings \u201cI\u2019m gonna run through the jungle with my head in a bag.\u201d The story of an artist, succumbed to his own stresses, fractured by self-isolation and mental anguish - the battle against his own Wild Knights has begun\u2026\n\u201cI\u2019ve found through some pretty intense reflection, that my songs come from way down,\u201d says Terry, \u201coften inspired by some subconscious brewing rather than purposeful effort. At times I\u2019m at a loss for their meaning, but I know when it feels right. Yet there comes a point where I can look back at a song and know exactly what I meant, in a prophetic sense\u201d. To that point, this new album from Aqueduct took as long as it needed to take; his creative voice stronger and more dynamic than ever.\nWild Knights takes us through the darkness of self-doubt, obsession, and the struggle of self-actualization, our champion eventually pulling an emotional sword from a heart of stone, only to find it still beating after all. It might not be a storybook, ever-after ending, but there\u2019s always chapter two\u2026\nHOW CAN I HELP? \nAqueduct fans can help me reach my fundraising goals by pre-ordering the long awaited new album Wild Knights!

The Edge (Teuton, Helos, The Fourth Planet).\nThe entire 150 page book will be gorgeously illustrated by many incredibly talented, acclaimed and award-winning artists. Mark Twain's Niagara takes the reader on the adventure of a lifetime! Through history, through fantasy, through Niagara, we see it all through Mark Twain's eyes.\nPortrait of Mark Twain by award-winning fine artist menton3, made exclusively for the Niagara graphic novel. You can get a signed copy as a backer reward!\nSTORY SYNOPSIS\nMark Twain's Niagara follows Twain as he travels for the first time to the Niagara region, visiting famous landmarks, witnessing living legends and interacting with historical figures along the way. In this way, we ourselves are witness to Mark Twain's exciting journey through legend and history. Told from the perspective of an old man, the story focuses on the younger version of Twain himself as he crosses borders for the first time in his lifetime.\nA VISUAL JOURNEY\nThis book will feature a unique visual experience unlike anything you've seen before! With every encounter Mark Twain has with the people and places that make up the stunning and rich region of Niagara, the perspective of the story visually changes. You, the reader, will experience the most exciting and legendary aspects of Niagara through Twain's eyes, as he imagines himself virtually living the history in the region that surrounds him.\nTHE ARTISTS\nThe base of the story will be illustrated by in-demand and superstar artist Adam Gorham (TMNT/Ghostbusters, X-Files, Dead Drop, Teuton). But here's the twist (!) - each scene that involves Twain encountering a special place in history or a fantastical figure of historical importance - will be illustrated by a separate artist. This will give Mark Twain's Niagara a brilliant look, full of variety, and a life all it's own, just like the legend himself.\nThe artists on board to illustrate special scenes in the book are Fred Pashe (SpiritWolf), award-winning fine artist and illustrator menton3 (MONOCYTE, The Fly: Outbreak, The X-Files), AASC Canadian Publishing Award & People's Choice Award nominee Andy Stanleigh (Titan: An Alternate History, Hobson's Gate), Joe Shuster Award winner and Canadian Comic Book Hall of Fame illustrator Claude St. Aubin (Superman, Batman, Green Lantern), award-winning artist and film-maker Nicholas Burns (Arctic Comics, Bride of Chucky, True North), internationally renowned concept artist Haiwei Hou (Two Brothers, Ochek), internationally acclaimed award-winning artist Jeffrey Veregge (G.I. Joe, Transformers, Judge Dredd), the brilliant Katherine Piro (The Chaste Maid), Shane Kirshenblatt (Dorothy Gale: Journey to Oz, The Bleeding Tree), Ben Shannon (Ayanisach, Superior Iron Man), Mike Rooth (Savage Sword, Captain Canuck, WidowsWake), Keith Grachow (Concrete Martians, Saltwater), superstar Ken Lashley (Batman, Superman, X-Men, The Avengers), Ty Templeton (Batman, Spider-Man, The Simpsons) and more!\nSAMPLE ART\nHere we have a dramatic scene in the story, illustrated by internationally renowned concept artist and illustrator Haiwei Hou, where we find young Twain has found himself in a place he should not be...\nArt by Haiwei Hou.

Get this image as a watercolour signed print, or framed canvas!\nPROJECT HISTORY\nMark Twain (Samuel Clemens), of course, being best known for \"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\" wrote passionately about the Niagara Region in a short story originally published in 1893. Screenwriter Zachary Schwartz - who visited Twain's home in Elmira, New York, as a child - could not understand why international visitors and local enthusiasts had never heard of this amazing short story before.\nLater in life, he (Schwartz) spent years crafting a screenplay based on Twain's experiences in Niagara. This screenplay has since earned much attention from The American Film Company and Lightstorm Entertainment. In advance of the film production, AH Comics is now producing this graphic novel adaptation of Schwartz's original screenplay!\nBETWEEN THE LINES\nThe Mark Twain's Niagara graphic novel is based on the screenplay originally written by Zachary Schwartz, born and raised in Niagara Falls, Canada. Zach has an extremely long resume as an actor in film, television and stage productions, including roles in 28 films before the age of 21. His work in film includes cult favourites such as Bride of Chucky and Boondock Saints. His television appearances include Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream, Clear Water and Kids in the Hall. On stage, Zach has performed in Sweeney Todd, Rocky Horror Picture Show, Crazy For You, Oliver, Jesus Christ Superstar, Little Shop of Horrors and Grease. He has completed elite programs and certificates from the American Music and Dramatic Academy, New York, the Meisner Certificate in Dramatic Arts from JoAnne Barron D. W. Brown Studio in Los Angeles, California and Improvisation Consummate at Second City, Toronto.\nThe graphic novel adaptation is written by Mark Shainblum, a novelist and comic book author from Ottawa, Canada. He is an award-winning writer and editor of science fiction, fantasy and comic books. He is the co-creator of the Northguard comic book series and character, considered to be one of the finest Canadian comics in history according to Den of Geek.com. Mark also worked on the classic Canadian superhero series Captain Canuck, and the Classics Illustrated adaptation of William Shakespeare's The Tempest and The Haunting of MacGrath. In 1998 he co-edited the Aurora Award winning alternate history anthology Arrowdreams with John Dupuis. Most importantly for this project, Mark wrote the incredible short story The Break Inspector, which was named a finalist in the 2001 Mark Twain Writing Competition.\nAH Comics Inc. will publish the work. Their debut publication, Titan: An Alternate History, was named \"The Best in New Graphic Novels\" by The National Post in 2011, and entered into the required reading curriculum for a contemporary Canadian literature course at Western University. Their second project, Hobson's Gate, is a 3 part graphic novel series that has been named for an Association of Arts & Social Change Publishing Award, as well as an AASC People's Choice Award. A portion of every sale of Hobson's Gate is donated to mental health charities in Canada. Their third book, Delta -  the concept graphic novel/musical album with The River Pilots - was in the selection process for a Juno nomination in 2013. Their 256 page publication the Jewish Comix Anthology: Volume 1 raised over $52,000 on Kickstarter, and contains work from some of the biggest names in comic book history including Art Spiegelman, Will Eisner, Harvey Pekar, Joe Kubert, Michael Netzer and Stan Lee. AH Comics' latest project, the incredible MOONSHOT: The Indigenous Comics Collection, was named as one of the top 10 crowdfunding successes in Canada by the Globe and Mail, raising over $74,000, which includes donating hundreds of books to educational institutions, libraries and community centers across the US and Canada.\nNOW\nWhat you are pledging for today is to help produce the 150 page graphic novel Mark Twain's Niagara! Our goal - your funding dollars - will go directly to the author adapting the script and the individual artists creating the book, plus printing of the first run of copies and the ever-coveted backer rewards (scroll down to see our list of great rewards for backers and Stretch Goals related to the Niagara Falls region)!\nSee below for our list of must-have rewards for backing the project, including:\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe artwork has to be completed in a linear fashion by several artists, all made to fit together under one script, so the timeline is a bit longer than our other projects.

It\u2019s all up to them!\nNo Thank You, Evil! is tabletop game of creative make-believe, adventure, and storytelling. In No Thank You, Evil!, each player creates a character based on a couple of cool, descriptive, imagination-firing traits. The Guide (a special role often played by a parent or older sibling) presents a dilemma, and the players set off on an adventure of the imagination. Along the way they use their character\u2019s special skills, companions, and equipment to overcome obstacles\u2014perhaps fighting a slime monster, winning over the suspicious mayor, or beating a rabbit at a race.\nWhereas conventional board games constrain players\u2019 actions, No Thank You, Evil! sets kids\u2019 imaginations free: Their options are limited only by what they can think up. Together, the players create a story as they work together to make their way through the adventure!\nFor the Little Kids, the Grown-ups, and Everyone in Between\nYounger kids frustrate easily when a game is too complex for them to master. Older children quickly grow bored by games that are too simple or that strike them as below their level.\nNo Thank You, Evil! is great fun for kids as young as five years old. But it\u2019s also great fun for the rest of family\u2014adults included!\u2014because the scalable rules adapt easily to the abilities of the player. A six-year-old might play, for example, a Princess. An eight-year-old might play a Super Smart Princess. A ten-year-old might create a Super Smart Princess who Experiments With Science. Each of these stages adds a level of sophistication to how the game is played\u2014but all of these characters play around the same table in the same game. After a game or two with the grown-ups, a twelve-year-old might even run games for the other kids!\nThe gameplay rules are easy for novice or young players to grasp, but nuanced and flexible enough for older kids and grown-ups to enjoy just as much. Here's a brief look at how the rules work:\nEnter Storia: The Land Next Door\nNo Thank You, Evil! is set in Storia: The Land Next Door. It\u2019s a world seen through children\u2019s eyes, home to all the elements of kids\u2019 imaginations: Dragons and dinosaurs, faeries and elves, race cars and robots, and all sorts of fanciful creatures. Players\u2019 characters in No Thank You, Evil! are kids who have been specially chosen to help save Storia from evil. Accompanied by their companions and their handy I Gotchyer Back packs (living creatures that carry the characters\u2019 cool stuff in their bellies), characters venture into Storia to save the day!\nFor more detailed info on the setting, game rules, and characters, visit the No Thank You, Evil! web site!\nWhat Is Monte Cook Games, and Why No Thank You, Evil!?\nMonte Cook Games has been publishing tabletop games since 2012\u2014though mostly for a grown-up audience. The idea for No Thank You, Evil! was born after many of our fans told us they\u2019d had unusual success introducing our games to their kids.\nIt wasn\u2019t long after the release of our flagship game Numenera that we began to hear from fans who weren\u2019t just gamers\u2014they were also parents. They were playing Numenera (and, later, The Strange) with their kids, and having a great time! We\u2019ve received drawings of characters, letters from young players, and papercrafts of scary creatures in our mailboxes and inboxes. We\u2019ve seen Disney princesses, weird Santas, saddle-wearing cat balloons, and all kinds of other super-imaginative ideas arise from families gaming together. Here are a few examples:\nNumenera Ninth World Christmas Special\nI Played Numenera with My Kids\nNumenera and a kid with mild Asperger\u2019s syndrome\nWhen we were kids, it didn\u2019t seem there were any parents who played roleplaying games. But now that so many of us gaming geeks are old enough to have kids, gamer families are looking for ways to bring their children into our amazingly imaginative hobby. And parents who aren\u2019t into hobby games are more interested than ever in activities that feed their children\u2019s imagination while bringing the whole family together.\nNo Thank You, Evil! will come in a beautiful, sturdy box just a bit larger than 8-1/2\" x 11\" (grown-up gamers, it will fit nicely on your shelf alongside your conventional roleplaying games). We\u2019re offering it in two versions: the Standard Edition and the exclusive Kickstarter Edition. The Standard Edition is what will ultimately be available in stores. We\u2019re adding some cool exclusives to the Kickstarter Edition, which will be available only through this campaign.\nStandard Edition: The Standard Edition contains everything you need to play, all in a beautiful, sturdy box designed to be easy for children to use. All of the components are premium quality. This is the edition that will be sold in stores.\nRulebook\nAdventure book\nFive dice\nCharacter sheets\nCards for characters, creatures, and cyphers\nGame tokens\nKickstarter Edition: The Kickstarter Edition has all the components you\u2019ll find in the Standard Edition. Furthermore, most of the stretch goals apply only to the Kickstarter Edition, so it's gotten (and continues to get) better and better. Back this campaign at a level that includes the exclusive Kickstarter Edition, and you\u2019ll get those upgrades as part of your reward! The Kickstarter Edition is only available through this campaign\u2014the only way to get it is to back this campaign now!\nEverything in the Standard Edition, plus:\nA larger, deluxe box\nExtra tokens\nA pad of character sheets\nPlus a set of five reusable character sheets\nCharacter standups\nA storybook that also introduces a great adventure for new players, called Lucy Lawful and the Awful Waffle\nTwo sticker sheets\nThe My Storia Travel Guide & Passport activity book\nA deck of equipment cards\nA cloth map of Storia: The Land Next Door!\nNo Thank You, Evil! reached its funding goal, so we added several stretch goals to make the game even better! When we reached $55,000 we added an Adventure Book to the Standard Edition and Kickstarter Edition, with more adventure content for your games. Additional goals reached added the Hero Stuff add-ons and a new backer level, new character types and companions, and reusable character sheets, character and companion standups, the storybook Lucy Lawful and the Awful Waffle, two sticker sheets, a deck of equipment cards, and the My Storia Travel Guide & Passport to the Kickstarter Edition.\nIf you\u2019ve followed us on social media or the blog at the Monte Cook Games web site, you may be aware that one of our playtest groups was at the Shanti Bhavan Children\u2019s Project in rural India. We\u2019ve worked with them, and with one or two other groups of children in developing countries, and while it\u2019s been great to see their reactions and get their feedback, it also drives home another point: Many children don\u2019t have good access to creative, intellectually challenging games of the sort that includes No Thank You, Evil!\nSo our last stretch goals weren't aimed at us, or at No Thank You, Evil! itself. Instead, they're for these kids. When we hit $110,000 we committed to donating 100 copies of the Standard Edition to schools, libraries, and organizations that serve at-risk and underprivileged kids. And we added another 20 copies for each $1000 beyond that.\nNo Thank You, Evil! has been in the works for over a year, and the design and development phase is drawing toward its end. That said, the game is many months from release. For grown-up gamers, waiting a few months might test your patience\u2014but in the same period, a child can go through significant changes in interests, intellectual ability, attention span, and more. When thinking about playing No Thank You, Evil!, don\u2019t forget to account for your children\u2019s ages at the time of release!\nAdd-ons are rewards that you add to your existing reward level. Simply increase the amount of your pledge by the appropriate amount. After the campaign ends, we\u2019ll get in touch with you about the extra money you pledged and what it was for. These add-ons items are only available through this Kickstarter campaign\u2014if you want them, be sure to add them to your pledge now!\nWe offer a variety of backer levels with some great rewards. The reward level details on the right can\u2019t be edited once a campaign is underway, but we can make changes to the words you\u2019re reading now\u2014so the notes below are up to date, including upgrades or additions we may make to the backer levels as the campaign progresses.\nYES PLEASE, PDF! You'll receive PDF files of all the print components within the Standard Edition. It contains the game rules, character sheet, 3 sheets of tokens, and 80 cards. The PDF is also included in the Kickstarter Edition, so this reward is also part of every backer level that includes the Kickstarter Edition.\nBASIC BOX This is the version of the game that will eventually be sold in stores. It contains the game rules, 6 character sheets, 3 sheets of die-cut tokens, 80 cards, and 5 dice. Unless otherwise noted, stretch goals that add items to the game don't apply to this version\u2014you'll want the Kickstarter Edition to get the coolest stuff!\nBOX OF AWESOME! You're going to love the Kickstarter Edition of the game, and you'll also get the PDF (which can be handy if you prefer to have the rules on a tablet or laptop). Most of the stretch goals apply only to the Kickstarter Edition, so back at this level or higher if you want this upgraded version and the stretch goals that make it even better!\nNO THANK YOU, PATIENCE! Can't wait for next February? Gain early access to the game. Components will be delivered in PDF format, so you'll have to print them yourself. And expect them in a very rough format\u2014not unlike what you've seen some of the playtesters using in our videos. You'll also receive updates and other information playtesters get. Our playtesting will continue for a couple of months, and we welcome your feedback, but you are not required to provide it if you'd rather not. You'll have to sign a non-disclosure agreement before we send you the materials. Expect the early access materials in June.\nYOURS TRULY, EVIL!

You get the Hero Stuff add-on package, plus the Postcards from Storia add-on, plus three extra copies of My Storia Travel Guide & Passport, on top of everything in the YOURS TRULY, EVIL! backer level. It's a great deal!\nBASH SOME EVIL! You and your child will be invited to play a game online with creator Shanna Germain! The game will be run via Skype or a similar online platform, and will probably take about an hour. Best of all, you'll get to play early; we'll contact you to arrange a date and time in the summer or fall of 2015. You'll likely be playing with one or two other backers and their children (we'll shoot for four to six total players, including parents and children, per session). NEW: You also get the Hero Stuff add-on package, plus the Postcards from Storia add-on, plus three extra copies of My Storia Travel Guide & Passport, at no extra cost!\nBE A HERO OF STORIA!

We'll need a suitable image of your child, and we'll need it very shortly after the end of this campaign (we'll contact you for it). Please, only children between the ages of 5 and 11. NEW: You also get the Hero Stuff add-on package, plus the Postcards from Storia add-on, plus three extra copies of My Storia Travel Guide & Passport, at no extra cost!\nHAPPY BIRTHDAY, EVIL!

The destination must be in the lower 48 of the United States, and the event must take place in 2016. Monte and Shanna do have some commitments in 2016, but we'll coordinate with you on timing that works for everyone! NEW: You also get the Hero Stuff add-on package, plus the Postcards from Storia add-on, plus three extra copies of My Storia Travel Guide & Passport, at no extra cost!\nRETAILER EXCLUSIVE This one is for retailers only, and we'll verify that you're a retailer before sending your reward. You get 10 copies of the Standard Edition of No Thank You, Evil! to sell, plus one copy of the Kickstarter Edition for you (you're welcome to sell it, but it will not be marked for retail). We'll send you a promo kit with great point-of-purchase materials about a month before street date, and we'll coordinate with you on promoting your store through our web site and robust social media presence in the lead-up to the game's release. You'll probably receive your games a couple of weeks before the street date (and you have our blessing to put them out for sale right away), but we can't guarantee it.\nBasic shipping in the United States is free. (If you\u2019re super-eager to get your copy, you can upgrade to a higher shipping class, but you\u2019ll be charged accordingly at the time of fulfillment.)\nFor international backers, you\u2019ll pay the shipping costs at the time of fulfillment, but we\u2019ll subsidize $10 of your basic shipping cost. (In other words, if the cost to ship is $32, you\u2019ll pay $22.) Warning: international shipping is expensive. We don\u2019t have any control over that, and we can\u2019t accurately predict what shipping rates will be at the time of fulfillment. If you\u2019re an international backer and have questions about shipping rates, you can visit the USPS web site to get an estimate. We anticipate\u2014but cannot guarantee\u2014that the Standard Edition will weigh about 3 pounds, and that the Kickstarter Edition will weigh in excess of 5 pounds. Both items are subject to spec changes, the addition of stretch goal items, and the weight of packaging. Please also be aware that you may be responsible for import duties, and that we must comply with international law and cannot mark your reward as a gift or as a zero-value item. Duties are not included in your shipping charge.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe\u2019re an experienced publisher of roleplaying games, including boxed products and non-book components such as cards and dice. We have a great track record of producing premium-quality products and have delivered scores of different rewards on or before deadline for multiple Kickstarted projects. This project is relatively simple compared to some of our previous campaigns.\n\nBut every publishing project carries risks. We have a small staff, so if one of our team breaks his or her leg while water-skiing this summer, it would have a bigger impact on our work than a larger company might see. And we rely on outside suppliers and shippers for printing and manufacturing, which involves possible risks there we can\u2019t foresee or control. But we deal with those concerns all the time, and continue to put out high-quality work on schedule.\n\nOf course, there\u2019s always the danger of meteor strikes, catastrophic solar flares, or the zombie apocalypse. But our staff is spread out across the country, so we\u2019re unlikely to all be wiped out at once.

If you missed the session, please enjoy the recording below!\nWatch the first FREE Critique, Demo and Q&A Session about drawing, posing and the Youssef Drawing Syllabus!\n Movement & Form - The Youssef Drawing Syllabus\nhttp://www.theyoussefdrawingsyllabus.com\nThis is the complete first book of my figure drawing program, focusing on techniques of gesture drawing, posing, movement, body mechanics, and form.  It is the foundation course that I teach to professional artists in the animation industry.\nMy syllabus stems from my studies at art academies around the world, my experience as a hand drawn feature animator, my directing experience with CG animators, and my training in classical ballet.  It's a method that applies to a wide range of artists from different backgrounds, CG & hand drawn animators, visual development artists, comic book artists, story artists, illustrators, character designers, sculptors, fine artists, art students and anyone who loves to draw.\nThis book will help you understand gesture, so that you can bring more life to your poses.  It will break down the body mechanics of the figure, shedding light on the incredible range of motion capable in the body as well as the limitations and restraints.  It addresses the form, structure, design, and aesthetic of the figure, and trains you to improve your ability to control proportion, without having to rely on measuring tools.  Most importantly, it will address the disconnect between gesture and rendered images, and bridge the gap where other figure drawing methods have not been able to.  These tools are valuable to all artists who work with the human figure, from academic drawing to stylized character illustrations.\n The Story of How This Book Came To Be\nSeveral years ago I was approached by a major animation studio to  train their artists.  I developed an artistic training program to target the needs of professional artists based on my consulting experience.  Soon after many other studios started contacting me to conduct workshops and sessions as well.  Since then, I have been invited to work with feature film, VFX and video game studios around the world.\nI have been privileged to work with incredibly talented people, and see the results of this syllabus I have designed in their work.  I hope this book will inspire other artists, help expand artistic awareness, and offer the language needed to have the words to express oneself through drawing.\nearly manuscript pages - there are over 215 images in the book!\nArtists who have signed up for courses with Samantha Youssef come from these studios:\nDreamworks Animation\nWalt Disney Animation Studios\nThe Walt Disney Company\nSony Pictures Imageworks\nReel FX\nFramestore\nMPC\nUbisoft\nBioware\nWarner Brothers Games\nEidos\nSquare Enix\nElectronic Arts\nGameloft\nVisceral Games\nDigital Dimension\nBehaviour Interactive\nWe are Minority\nTHQ\nCompanies that are clients of Samantha Youssef and Studio Technique's artistic training for their artists:\nArticles about Samantha Youssef & Studio Technique\nclick on the image to see press reviews\nclick here for IMDB film credits and professional work samples\nMasterclasses & Workshop Photos\nclick here to see more life drawings\n                                                                Collaboration with Live Model Books\nI have been honoured to be able to direct a photo shoot for the book with Live Model Books, the best model photography references for artists that I have ever seen.

Is this a dream come true? Numenera: Strand is the project that contains all that and more. This film is brought to you by Valdes/Eriksdotter & Monte Cook Games.\nNumenera: Strand is a 6-minute fantasy/sci-fi short film that started as a filmmakers dream about a year ago. Today that dream is close to coming true. The film takes place in a fantasy world based on Monte Cook Games\u2019 Numenera, a roleplaying game that takes you to the ends of your imagination.\n\nA drifter/scavenger roams a desolate beach in an imaginary world looking for useful items and stumbles upon an unusual item. This starts a chain of events leading to an experience that changes the very essence of his being.\n\nAs a filmmaker I'm constantly creating stories and worlds in my head. I saw how the endless possibilities in the game could translate to a movie adventure so I wrote a simple story of a drifter, exploring his surroundings. The world he is in is so vibrant that it feels hostile, a dangerous surrounding unable to be tamed.\nI loved the concept of creating a narrative within a group and being completely immersed by an imaginary world of ones own creation. I was inspired by the game and the escapism of a whole new and unexplored world, and that led to the creation of the short film Numenera: Strand.\nI was inspired by the game and the escapism of a whole new and unexplored world, and that led to the creation of the short film Numenera: Strand. I wanted to bring the game alive into a visual adventure of exploration.\nMonte Cook's Ninth World is such a incredibly creative achievement mainly because it allows for unlimited possibilities while still remaining credible as a plausible world.\n\nI wrote a simple story of a drifter, exploring his surroundings, a native of the Ninth World. The world is so vibrant that it feels hostile, a dangerous surrounding unable to be tamed.\nWe started pre-production early 2014 on our spare time and on our own limited budget. At the same time, unknown to us, Monte Cook Games was looking to connect with a filmmaker to produce a short film. We found each other in late 2014, and we\u2019re all very excited about the collaboration.\nWHO WE ARE\n\nAlong with the Monte Cook Games\u2019s group we have an awesome team working together to complete this journey. We are:\n\n- Ramtin Parvaneh, The Drifter, graduated from the Academy of Music and Drama in Gothenburg, Sweden in 2011. Since then, he\u2019s appeared in numerous plays and films. His resume includes Stockholm\u2019s City Theatre, the award winning short film H\u00e4ndelse vid bank and the tv serie's Kommissarie Winter.\n\n- Joan Manuel Urquiaga Valdes, the director, has been working as a visual effects artist for almost a decade, trying to move closer to answering the question of \u201dwhat else is there\". His work includes the short film \u201dRenaissance\u201d (2014) that premiered at the SCI FI London International Film Festival.\n- Niclas Sandberg is a Gothenburg based cinematographer. This is his third project working together with Joan Manuel Urquiaga Valdes. He shot Joan's sci-fi short Renaissance in 2014.\n\nWHERE WE ARE NOW\n\nWe shot most of the film in early 2014 and we have a rough cut going in to post-production. We spent two cold, windy and rainy days on the beach putting together our 6-minute short. The ice had just melted and we had excellent conditions, or lets say the conditions were excellent for giving us a beautiful image. For the crew it was a challenging shoot having to work in just above freezing temperatures and stormy weather. In the end we got almost all of the shots we wanted and are hoping to complete shooting with the collaboration of our supporters.\nWHAT IS THIS kr THAT YOU SPEAK OF?\nBecause we're launching our Kickstarter out of Sweden we have had to provide all our currency in Swedish kronor. Our funding goal is at kr290,000 SEK which translates to ~ $35,000. But don't be alarmed, we've written out the US dollar currency in the reward box below the pledge so that you can see what each reward translates to in dollars! As the currency stands today $1 will give you about 7kr.\nThat being said, here's a quick breakdown for shipping costs as well as an adjustment for the currency conversion in a couple of the rewards.\nReward #5: DVD viewer\nRest of world: kr80 SEK ~ $10\nEU: kr50 SEK ~ $6\nReward #6: DVD follower\nRest of world: kr80 SEK ~ $10\nEU: kr50 SEK ~ $6\nThe pledge conversion from kr 450 SEK amounts closer to ~ $54\nReward #7: Blu-ray viewer\nRest of world: kr80 SEK ~ $10\nEU: kr50 SEK ~ $6\nThe pledge conversion from kr 500 SEK amounts closer to ~ $60\nReward #8: Blu-ray follower\nRest of world: kr125 ~ $15\nEU: kr70 SEK ~ $9\nThe pledge conversion from kr 600 SEK amounts closer to ~ $72\nReward #9: Dedicated follower\nRest of world: kr125 ~ $15\nEU: kr70 SEK ~ $9\nThe pledge conversion from kr 1000 SEK amounts closer to ~ $120\nWe apologize but the shipping prices for below reward is incorrect. This are the correct shipping costs.\nReward #11: Blu-ray explorer\nRest of world: kr125 ~$15\nEU: kr70 ~ $9\nSweden: kr50~ $6\nExchange rates fluctuate all the time, usually by just a couple percent or so, but there are no guarantees. If you are outside of Sweden, the amount you are charged will be based on the exchange rate for your currency at the moment the campaign ends.\nWHERE DOES THE MONEY GO\nWe believe a successful short film could lead to the making of a larger production one day while also drawing more fans into the Ninth World. Want to see a feature film based on Numenera or The Strange some day? There\u2019s never been a feature based on a roleplaying game before, let\u2019s see it happen. We could be the new Superman or X-Men! This is a great stepping stone to that reality.\nWe wanted to bring the game alive into a visual adventure of exploration. And now we are actually here. Together with all your help we are heading for finalization of this film. Let\u2019s make this dream come true.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRISKS & CHALLENGES\n\nWe would love nothing more than to make the most awesome movie ever, but there\u2019s always a risk that we won\u2019t bring in the best talent due to budget constraints.\n\nFortunately we\u2019ve shot most of the movie and are hoping that with your support that we\u2019ll be able to put the best effects on our movie, reflecting the wonder and weirdness of the Ninth World as accurately as possible.\n\nWe hope you\u2019re as excited as we are about completing this film.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #37", "update_userinfo": "Online streaming link sent! + replacement disc issues", "update_content": "Hi all online streaming backers!\nFinally yesterday afternoon (Swedish time) we sent out the big one: The online streaming link!\nPlease check you inboxes if you haven't already.

We believe that there are brilliant people of all kinds out there: developers, designers, artists, engineers, creators, and thinkers. As creatives, we know that there are a lot of fantastic digital tools out there to help bring our ideas to life. But what about those tools that we use off the screen? There's a certain freedom in taking pen to paper in order to express the thoughts that we have, as we have them. We found that, while there are many notebooks of all shapes and sizes out there, none truly embodied the characteristics we found important for our work. And so we decided that we'd make them. \nLet's talk about our notebooks.\nOur work is a reflection of who we are, and it was important that we made these notebooks to be the perfect companion for creatives who not only need something functional, but also attractive. It's not enough just to throw some shoddy paper into some pieces of cardboard and call it a notebook (though that does seem to be the \"industry standard\"). \nOur two notebooks, the Origin and the Traveler, were designed to offer a great set of useful features without going overboard. The paper is thick and durable, ready for your ideas no matter where you may have them. The binding is sewn with quality thread, and constructed in a way to allow the notebooks to lie flat, no matter what page you're on. \nOf course, it was important that the pages themselves provided a unique way to categorize your thoughts. The left-side pages of our notebooks all have a dot grid to allow for sketches, drawings, and wireframes. The right-side pages all contain our special Indentation Rule, which provides a narrow ruling with vertical dash-marks every 5 millimeters to allow notes, lists, paragraphs, and code to be properly indented and neatly kept. \nWe could go on and on, but as they say, a picture is worth a thousand words:\nLays flat!\nShow me what I can get!\nIt doesn't matter how much you pledge; we appreciate every little bit of support we get!

They are BEST friends. They met at Special Olympics while they were in grade school and have been pretty much inseparable since. \nFor the most part, they're normal teenage dudes. They like to skate and play video games and talk about girls and stuff, but the one thing they both LOVE is cinema. They love to go to the movies, talk about movies, brainstorm movie ideas, and act out their favorite scenes.\nThree years ago, they started brainstorming their own Teen Zombie Movie (a favorite genre). This was nothing out of the ordinary -- they are constantly hatching zany schemes to \"launch their careers.\" But something about this zombie movie has stuck with them. For three years. Honestly, they won't shut up about it. \nEvery time they get together, they draw up storyboards, practice fight scenes, film with their iPhones (then pair those scenes with dream soundtracks), and endlessly debate celebrity cameos.  They have been so passionate about this film for so long, that their friends and family decided it was time to help them make it happen FOR REAL. \nWHO IS RUNNING THIS KICKSTARTER?\nThis campaign was launched by a big group of Sam & Mattie's friends, loosely organized by Sam\u2019s older brother Jesse (who is writing what you're reading now. Hi!). What we all have in common is this: we love Sam & Mattie, we think they are the coolest two dudes in the world, and we're all pretty sure their movie is gonna blow you away. \nIf you wanna know more about our creds, check out the \"meet the team\" section below.\nTELL ME ABOUT THE PLOT OF THIS \"TEEN ZOMBIE MOVIE.\"\nWe think some sample scenes (straight outta Sam & Mattie\u2019s original Storyboards, pictured below) will speak for themselves:\nPolice skateboard chase\n\u201cBeing cool in high school\u201d montage\nZombie Prom Ambush\nSelfies / sexting on jetpacks\nShirtless workout montage\n\u201cBeing cool in college\u201d montage\nHotel party with hot girlfriends\nBuying drugs in the city\nTWO separate arrest scenes\nPrison workout montage\nZombie yacht battle\nYacht party with DJ Pauly D (100% unconfirmed)\n...so as you can see, this teen zombie movie is pretty much guaranteed to be awesome. Right now it's clocking in as a 15 - 20 minute short, but that might change during script development. \nSOUNDS... A LITTLE WILD. WILL IT BE PG-13?\nSam and Mattie are pretty wild dudes, and yes, they do have some racy ideas. We will TRY to keep this thing PG-13, but they have final creative say... so no guarantees.\nCAN YOU REALLY PULL THIS OFF?\nHell yes. Sam\u2019s brother and his pals have rallied a team of brilliant filmmaker types. We already have DPs, directors, editors, line producers, graphics people, a sound guy, and more -- and everyone's super excited to get started!  \nMEET THE TEAM (SO FAR):\nBobby Carnevale (Zombie Film Director / Director of Photography) http://www.robertcarnevale.com/\nTim Forster (Documentary Director / Editor) - http://timfo.info/\nSuzy Beck (Producer) http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2684688/\nOther friends who have helped so far include (but are not limited to): Chuck Westcott & Emilie Holland, Julia Ries, Brian Ries, Ina Burke, Eric Tao, The Prefab Messiahs (thanks for the awesome song!), Debi Hammack (thanks for the awesome illustrations!), Chris Suchmann & Mary Pendergast (Sam's Parents), Eric and Carol Zufelt (Mattie's Parents), Dan Neibles for martial arts training, and many more people I am definitely forgetting (sorry!).\nWe have the team, now we just need some funding to officially book the crew and rent the equipment.\nDO YOU HAVE A SOLID PLAN?\nSuzy Beck, our talented producer and long time friend of Sam\u2019s, has put together a budget, crew list, and detailed schedule for a 7-day zombie shoot in Providence, RI. Bobby Carnevale has agreed to direct and coordinate everything zombie related.\nTim Forster has signed on to direct the documentary and edit everything. He will assemble his crew based on the zombie dates and locations, though the doc team will likely be filming long before and after the 7 day shoot.\nPost production will probably happen in NYC, as many of us live / work here. So yes, we're pretty sure we know what we need to do.\nOK, IF I SUPPORT YOU GUYS, WHERE EXACTLY WILL MY MONEY GO? 50K IS A LOT.\nWe're making two movies at the same time, but our goal is to spend the majority of our budget on the zombie movie. It will probably be a short -- less than 20 minutes -- but Sam and Mattie watch tons of hollywood blockbusters, and they have extremely high-budget aspirations. Their vision DEMANDS explosions, jetpacks, blood, swords, disco balls, famous DJ\u2019s, props, zombie make-up, music, special effects, and (obviously) an insane wrap party... all of which are very, very expensive. \nThen, of course, there's creation/distribution of the amazing Kickstarter rewards we're offering in the sidebar (hint, hint) ------->\nAfter covering those costs, we will use the remainder of our budget to fund a documentary crew to capture the magic of their creative process (it really is magic, trust us) and to follow their journey for as long as possible.\nWHY SHOULD I DONATE? CAN\u2019T I JUST SEE THE MOVIE FOR FREE WHEN IT\u2019S DONE?\nWe will eventually release the zombie short online, but it might never happen at all (definitely not the documentary) if this campaign doesn\u2019t succeed. Supporting this Kickstarter makes you an integral part of the film's creation! \nBacking us also offers you a behind the scenes look at Sam and Mattie\u2019s creative process via the production diary, which will be a wild ride, we promise.\nYou're not just backing a simple movie here. You're backing:\nFriendship \nSam and Mattie's careers\nThe greatest Teen Zombie Movie ever made\nHappiness\nThe fulfillment of teenage dreams\nThe RI film industry\nA documentary with the potential to inspire every single person on planet earth \nProof that anything is possible\nA delicious burger buffet\nLastly, it's pretty safe to assume this will be a cult classic, so you're also basically buying bragging rights for life.\nMAYYYYBEEE. I\u2019M STILL ON THE FENCE. ARE THERE COOL REWARDS?\nDuh. Of course Sam and Mattie brainstormed awesome stuff for you (check out footage from the brainstorm below). Some of the ideas didn't make the final cut for budget and/or legal and/or weirdness reasons, but hopefully one of them will catch your eye!\nPLAY\n\nIf you've made it this far, thanks for reading! Even if you can't back us financially, you can help us by sharing this page on facebook or twitter! \n\"You guys are our fans. Without you guys i'd just be a pretty face in high school. And Mattie would just be a cool guy who wants to be a DJ.\" -Sam\nThanks for your time!\n- Sam, Mattie, & friends", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have a team of highly experienced filmmakers. \n\nIf this campaign is successful we will have the budget.\n\nThat said, Sam and Mattie are in charge of this operation, and this is their first film... so there might be delays, script changes, total rewrites... anything is possible! We all need to stay flexible, because it's all about following their creative vision!\n\nWhat we promise is this: we will capture all the twists and turns, and share them with you along the way. If all goes according to plan, the journey will be almost as awesome as the zombie movie itself.

My first book was called reMIND which took seven years to complete. Now I have been working on a brand new story called SITHRAH.\nWhat is SITHRAH?\nSITHRAH is an all-age sci-fi about a seven year old girl who ends up alone when her plane crashes in a unfamiliar land. Trying to locate her missing father, she starts seeing an invisible creature that has been following her. This book will be the first in a series of 5 or 6 books depending on how long it takes me to tell the story. :)\nI was inspired by comic artists in the 90's when I refined my drawing style and then was influenced by Miyazaki's movies and storytelling over the last decade.\nFeel free to read through as many pages as you want on my website here. I will continue to post new pages online until the full story is complete.\nAs you can see I'm experimenting with the comic format by mixing subtle prose with the comic panels. My hope is to blur the lines between comics, children's books, and novels without making it jarring for the reader.\nBook Specs.\nSITHRAH will be 96 full color pages in a hardcover book. 1000 copies will include a signed and numbered bookplate. The interior pages will be printed on thick, high quality paper printed with the same care and attention to detail that I put into reMIND Volume 1 and 2. The retail price will be $19.95.\nJust so you know some history of my books: The first printing of my first book, reMIND, was printed in spring of 2011 with 2500 copies that sold out in about 6 months. It got much praise from fans on Amazon and has won some awards and achievements during and after the production including:\n2010 Xeric Grant Winner\n2012 Great Graphic Novels for Teens List (GGNT)\n2012 Selected for Arkansas State Reading list.\nPublication Date\nSITHRAH will be ready to go to the printer in October 2014 if everything goes according to plan. The printing process will take about 3 months for the proofs, printing and shipping to happen. This means I'll probably be getting the books around January or maybe February if the holidays get in the way (which I assume they will)\nI put April as the shipping date as an absolute worst case scenario if I can't get the printing started when planned. But I am estimating that the books will be in my garage by January so I can start shipping them out soon after that.\nWhy Self-Publish?\nPeople ask me why I chose to self-publish reMIND and SITHRAH. Well, when I started this my dream was to get the best agent and publisher and take the world by storm with my graphic novels. What I learned is that nobody cares about what you want to do until after you prove yourself. So I started posting pages online in 2009 to try to grow an audience and sure enough a small group started following my progress. Later I applied for the self publisher's Xeric grant in 2010 and won $5000. This convinced me to fully commit to self-publish and it was then that I launched my first kickstarter back in 2010. To my surprise I raised over 12 thousand additional dollars to help print the first volume. Now I HAD to self-publish as well as learn to distribute and sell my books. My original kickstarter campaign has been essential in getting reMIND where it is now and it has opened up doors that I never thought possible. Then in 2012 I launched a second campaign for reMIND 2 and it raised a whopping $107,500! Although it was a crazy big campaign delivering so many books, it all worked out. Better yet, I now have a distributor for my books which was one of the biggest problems to overcome with self-publishing.\nThe funny thing is now that I have beautiful books published I am approached by big publishers like I had dreamed about. I could easily sign a contract with a good publisher but in being forced to self publish, I have also fallen in love with it. I can make the books exactly how I want them to look and reprint them whenever I want. I can focus on what's important to me instead of a publisher who is mainly focused on the bottom line. It's a ton of work and I still have a lot to learn but overall I love self-publishing as well as owning all the rights to my stories.\nMy business plan is to get to the point where I can make a living off of my self-publishing by always printing high quality first printing books that are numbered, rare and sending them directly to my customers. The second and third printings will be manufactured more with mass distribution in mind once I figure that part out a little better.\nI hope the quality of my books are apparent as soon as you see it on the shelf and even more so when you slowly flip through the pages. My goal has always been to make a coffee table book that also happens to be a comic.\nMoney\nNow lets talk about where the money will go. With SITHRAH I have decided that my goal is to print 4000 copies for the first printing. This will further reduce the printing costs and give me more stock so I don't sell out in 6 months like I did with reMIND. Wait, what am I saying. I'd love to sell out in 6 months! :)\nAnyway, so my printer quote is $11,500 for 4000 hardcover copies. In my last campaign I had crazy shipping costs, taxes and unexpected fees and so I'm trying to add some of these fees to the campaign funding goal. If I can raise over $17,000 I will be in a great spot to cover most of the expense of Sithrah Book 1. As usual, I'm always adding my own money to the mix and I will do the same with this one to make sure the book turns out amazing.\nRemember that Kickstarter is an All-or-Nothing system. If I can't raise the full amount in the time given then I won't get anything. :(\nThanks for your support in making SITHRAH the best graphic novel set it can be!\nTHANK YOU ONE MILLION TIMES!\n- Jason\nArt Submission:\nJust like my past publications, I want to include some guest art in the back of the printed book. And so\u2026 I'm going to ask for art submissions while this campaign is live to give you a chance to get your art featured in the gallery of Sithrah: Book 1. Send me your amazing artistic version of the Sithrah characters and I will choose some of them to be printed in the book. FOREVER! I will credit you in the book too.\nThe page dimensions are 6.75 inches (wide) x 10.5 inches (tall). Please make sure all art is 300dpi when scanned. The deadline for submission is the closing of this campaign. Please send all submissions to Jason@remindblog.com for consideration.

These graphics can consist of paths, images, and/or text that are able to be scaled and resized without losing image quality (I know, right?!). Inline SVG refers to the embedded code written to generate these graphics.\nGetting into the world of inline SVG can be vast and intimidating. It\u2019s difficult to understand where to start and get a handle on all the syntax involved. This PDF and EPUB strives to provide designers and developers with the base knowledge needed to get started writing SVG and better understand its overall syntax and behavior through clear examples (with fruit images!) and thorough descriptions of properties and attributes.\nFrom small stroke details to getting started with hand crafted patterns, this \"pocket\" guide aims to be an all around \u201cgo-to\u201d reference for inline SVG use.\nCurrent Focus & Release\nIn terms of content, the book is currently about 85% written.

Also...text on a path!\nClips & Masks -Overview on how to restrict regions to which paint is applied.\nGradients -Intro the the basic structure and attributes to get you started drawing SVG gradients.

This is what we started with for the game design. \nThe game has a wooden gridded board, four mouse pawns for each player and a deck of sword, stronghold and diplomacy cards.\nAfter we created the initial rules, we sent out a print and play version to our friends and fans to play test for us.

We will therefore try our best to make it a reality. Also I should note that we still plan to release the 30 minute version for free online. We haven't been able to figure out all the details regarding the rewards for the feature, but we get back with more info in just a couple of days.\nUPDATE #2\nIf we manage to reach $750,000 we will have a special screening in your city, with a meet and greet afterwards!\nGo to www.kungfury.net to submit your city, vote and spread the word! The two (2) cities with the most votes will get the special screening! The voting will end once the campaign is finished, so hurry up!\nTickets to the event is sold separately. The screening will take place after the Kung Fury release. \nUPDATE #1\nSorry for being unclear regarding shipping and the rewards. You won't have to pay for shipping, regardless of where in the world you are! All of the rewards from $20 and above will include the digital download, sneak peak and access to the production diary, Unfortunately we can't edit the description for the rewards. \n--\nKUNG FURY is an over-the-top action comedy written and directed by David Sandberg. The movie features: arcade-robots, dinosaurs, nazis, vikings, norse gods, mutants and a super kung fu-cop called Kung Fury, all wrapped up in an 80s style action packed adventure. \nDuring an unfortunate series of events a friend of Kung Fury is assasinated by the most dangerous kung fu master criminal of all time; Adolf Hitler, a.k.a Kung F\u00fchrer. Kung Fury decides to travel back in time, to Nazi Germany, in order to kill Hitler and end the Nazi empire once and for all. Kung Fury is a visually spectacular action comedy that has it's foundation in 80s cop movies.\nWhen I started this project over a year ago I was driven by a strong will, love for the 80s and action movies to create a unique movie that the world has never seen, which has taken to a finished trailer and enough material to create a 30 minute long film. This with help of friends and giddy days. This movie has been made on a very limited budget. At the beginning of this project I took $5000 of my own money and just started shooting whenever I and my friends had time. \nKung Fury takes place in a variety of exotic locations; 1980s Miami, Asgard and Germany in the 1940s, to name a few. With a limited budget to work with, we had to solve this by shooting most of the scenes against a greenscreen backdrop. \nShooting on greenscreen means that we have to recreate these environments digitally instead. The advantage of shooting on greenscreen is that it doesn't require expensive sets or locations to shoot, it is very simple and only requires a small crew, which helped a lot in keeping the costs down. However, once you're done shooting a movie like this, there's a massive post-production phase that requires a lot of time and effort by talented visual effects artists.\nWhen I started this project I knew that I had the skillset required to make a movie like this, since I have a background in visual effects. Now I need the manpower to finish it.\nHence kickstarter and the wish for you to get involved in this project, where all my dedication remains and where my goal is to finish this movie and share it with the world. \nWith the kickstarter funding we'll hire a team of 7 visual effects artists who will work closely with David Sandberg on the post-production for a period of 6 months to complete the film. Pretty much every shot in this film requieres some form of visual effects treatment so there's a lot of work to be done. Apart from creating all the environments digitally, there's a lot of CG animated characters such as dinosaurs and robots that requires talented people and lots of time. To hire these artists we need to be able to pay them a decent salary. Money will also go to hire an exceptional artist to create the artwork for the movie poster. It will have that classic, illustrated 80s style that you rarely see anymore. Costs will also go to the rewards, such as printing costs for posters and stickers, t-shirts, blu-rays etc.\nWe're open to all the help we can get, so if you're a 3D artist, 3D animator, visual effects artist, compositor, or if you feel like contribute to this movie in any way not mentioned here, please contact us at: laserunicorns@gmail.com\nNo man should be left empty handed, so we've put together packages of exclusive rewards for each donator, all from t-shirts and posters to the soundtrack by Mitch murder and Lost years. Find more about the rewards on the panel to the right.\nIf this kickstarter campain is successful, we will release this 30 minute film online, for free. We want everybody to be able to watch and enjoy this film. It is our dream to be able to expand this into a full feature film. And if we were to exceed our kickstarter goal that something we want to look into.\nThis film was shot entirely on the Canon 5d, with the exception of the slow-mo scenes which were shot with the Sony FS700.\n CAST & CREW\nDavid Sandberg has worked closely with the production company Lampray (www.lampray.se) from the start. The company is run by Linus Andersson and Martin G\u00e4rdemalm.\nRecently the production company Salmon Fox (www.salmonfox.com) got onboard with the project. With the Academy Award nominated producer Mathias Fjellstr\u00f6m. David and Mathias share a love for the 80s and that will reflect in the final film.\nBecause this film has been shot on the span of over a year, there's been a number of talented cinematographers involved. They are:\nMartin G\u00e4rdemalm, Linus Andersson, Jonas Ernhill, Mattias Andersson (www.anderssonmattias.com) and aerial cinematography by Henning Sandstr\u00f6m (www.vimeo.com/henning). \nStarring: David Sandberg as \"Kung Fury\", Joanna H\u00e4ggblom as \"Viking Babe\", Leopold Nilsson as \"Hacker Man\", Andreas Cahling as \"Thor\" and Per-Henrik Arvidius as \"Chief\"", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nKUNG FURY is a very ambitious project to say the least. The good news is that we've already shot most of the film, so that eliminates a degree of worry right away. There's so many man-hours that has went into creating this, that it is just not an option to give up at this point. It is currently the funding that is holding us back and finding money for a movie is hard, especially for a crazy project like this.

We think we\u2019ve got something good and if you agree, we\u2019d love you to join us and tell everyone you know about it.\nFollowing the success of our anatomical male reference figure on Kickstarter, we really enjoyed creating a tool to help artists get the most out of their artwork.

We make salami.\nThe Underground Food Collective and Underground Meats is a group of people who love food and sharing it with our friends and family. We\u2019ve been cooking and producing sustainable local food for years, supporting area farmers and growers. We started small, building off catering events, pop-up dinners, and word-of-mouth to open a couple restaurants, a catering facility, a meat/charcuterie production facility and a butcher shop. We feel extremely grateful and lucky for our success. We had a lot of help from our friends and family to get to this point.\nYou guys know about rules, right?\nUp this point we\u2019ve faced many obstacles and hurdles along the way. One of the most challenging of those obstacles was opening our charcuterie production facility. State and federal guidelines for salami production are complex and cost-prohibitive. The government requires a detailed food safety and sanitary practice plan. This is known as a HACCP, which stands for Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points. Essentially, the state/feds want to make sure your product is safe for consumption and your HACCP plan will be a detailed document explaining how you will operate and most crucially how you will keep levels of contaminates safe in your product for your consumers. \nThe access to information is blocked...\nUp until now, salami producers in the United States have held their HACCP plans under lock and key as intellectual property. This is understandable, producers generally need to hire an outside source to validate their procedures and techniques to the state/federal agencies. These expensive studies and product testing (thousands of dollars to start) are crippling to many small to medium salami production facilities. \nWe want to SHARE it.\nOur goal is to create a transparent, concise HACCP model for small salami producers to use including the crucial links to studies and validation for procedure.  \nWe will use Kickstarter funds to:\n\u2022create a dry cured salami production HACCP plan and share it with the world. We'll release the plan under the CC0 Public Domain Dedication.\n\u2022Get our salami out there! We want more of you to be excited about the traditional aspects of our product, and about sustainability as it pertains to meat consumption in general. \n\u2022Provide instructional videos and templates to our salami-making process. We carry out the process all day, every day, and we can't wait to share it with you in more dynamic forms. \nCheck out our other instructional videos on Vimeo here.\n\u2022Invite you in. Come see our facility! Get to know us and our tools! \n\u2022For top tier supporters, we will personally help you write your HACCP plan and provide studies and documentation to support and validate your procedure.\n ** Let\u2019s make our local food more accessible and safe. **\nOur hogs at Rollercoaster Farms, Darlington, WI.\nJerry teaching a Whole Hog Breakdown class.\nSmall Format Salami Product Line :\n\u2022 Saucisson Sec \u2022 black pepper, garlic \n\u2022 Goat Salami \u2022 rosemary, cinnamon, 75% goat, 25% pork\n\u2022 Spanish Chorizo \u2022 smoked paprika, cayenne, chili pepper\n\u2022 Finocchiona \u2022 fennel, white pepper\nLarge Diameter Salami Product Line:\n\u2022 Peperone \u2022 anise, paprika, cayenne\n\u2022 Tuscan Salami \u2022 toasted fennel, red wine\n\u2022 Soppressata \u2022 allspice, chili, white pepper\nUnderground Meats Tote\nFrom our friends at Baggu- a bag made with 100% Recycled Cotton, screenprinted down the street in Madison, WI at Screen Door Studio Studios.

Here are just a few endorsements from big names that Loic and 3dtotal were overwhelmed to read:\n\"I noticed Lo\u00efc's work several years ago - in particular his piece entitled 'The Assassin'. I hadn't seen digital artwork executed with such a dynamic approach, using 3D and 2D applications to bring the piece to a finish. It's a philosophy I started applying to my own work not getting tied down to either or to create an evocative piece. I'm extremely excited to see a book filled with his work across multiple disciplines and can't wait to flip through my copy!\"\nAndrew Baker, Digital Sculptor/Designer, Weta Workshop\n\"I've been a fan of Zimmermann's work for many, many years. He was one of my biggest inspirations when I started to work in this industry. Such a talent in so many levels and with so different techniques. It's a pleasure to help him on this project somehow. Thanks 3dtotal for creating this project, I hope we can see all of his 3D pieces on it - I need this book on my reference shelf!\"\nRafael Grassetti, Character Art Supervisor, Sony\nPlease take a moment to check out our vision behind this book, as well as the exclusive rewards that we have cooked up with Lo\u00efc to say a massive THANKS for your pledges...\nHere is a mock-up of the e338: The Art of Lo\u00efc Zimmermann book cover featuring one of the girls from the incredible Binaural series\n\"It's like cheese and dessert: a book and some collector prints! It's essentially a great way to get some original artworks and leave with a book on top\" Lo\u00efc e338 Zimmermann\nFind out more from the man himself in an interview with Lo\u00efc over on our website.\nThis luxurious art book will feature over 100 images crafted by the talented hands and mind of Lo\u00efc e338 Zimmermann. The scope of the book makes it particularly exciting, covering collections of his personal work from all genres: concept art, digital illustration, 3D modelling, digital sculpture, photography, filmmaking and even mixed media - which combines both digital and traditional techniques for mind-blowing results!\nHere is a selection of character concepts from Lo\u00efc's portfolio\nLo\u00efc's talent is far from restricted to characters; he's also a dab-hand at scenes too!\nAs well as a stunning art book, it is also designed to be an inspirational guide for artists and art lovers alike, including tips on how to be proactive as an artist, how to problem-solve design challenges, as well as offering insights into his personal creation techniques - and this stuff is gold! Great care will be taken over the design and layout of the images and articles to ensure the art has the room it needs to breathe, while still satisfying your desire to devour an immensely rich collection of art.\nLo\u00efc has a keen eye for a fantastic photograph. Here are just a few of his clever snaps\nLo\u00efc has also been known to dabble with comic book illustrations...\nAnd his mixed media works have been exhibited and sold in galleries all around the world!\nExclusive to this 'art of' book is Lo\u00efc's most recent Binaural illustration series, which features several images of beautiful female characters wearing spectacularly colourful space helmets. The idea for the first Binaural girl originated during several nights of insomnia, and has since evolved into a thrilling series of images - each one sharing fragments of the last. Here is a sneak peek at what's in store...\nThe Binaural girls, strutting their stuff...\nHere is an early mock-up of a spread in the book. This one features one of the Binaural girls too! Every effort will be made to ensure this book is clean and reflects the styling of Lo\u00efc's impressive portfolio\nWhat's more, Pascal Blanch\u00e9, Art Director at Ubisoft Montreal, will be opening the book with a passionate foreword about Lo\u00efc's work. Pascal and Lo\u00efc are comrades who both thoroughly enjoy pushing the boundaries and playing with colour in ways that many artists dare not to try. This combination of Pascal Blanch\u00e9 and Lo\u00efc Zimmermann is an electrifying cocktail of talent that we can't wait to bring together!\nThis book is a real treat for us at 3dtotal Publishing, as it's our first foray into compiling an art collection that focuses on one artist across a variety of art genres. To make it really special we have decided to give it a medium-format feel, to reflect the style of Lo\u00efc's work and the media he uses.\nIt will measure 255x255mm in size and will be presented in a beautiful slipcase. We are exploring the options with our printers to find the best results for the book cover and the slipcase as we want to ensure it has the right quality for an art book of this ilk. We have already produced books in the past with a variety of cover and slipcase options, so we are confident that we can come up with something awesome for this very special art book.\nThe book will comprise of 152 pages, and for Kickstarter backers only each book will come with a signed and numbered certificate. Backers can also get their names printed IN THE BOOK!\n\"The pledges we've come up with for this project are a complete extension of the book itself\" Lo\u00efc e338 Zimmermann\nOver the past few months we have been putting our heads together with Lo\u00efc's to come up with a range of tiers that offer something for everyone to enjoy, including:\na signed and numbered certificate inside every book plus your name printed inside the book itself.

It's new and it's exciting. We wanted to open this project up to the community to let you be a part of it, as well as to find out whether it's an avenue you want us to pursue in the future. Your pledges will help us to cover the production of the book, fund the unique rewards and ensure that the book is of the quality that Loic's work deserves. \nSure, we have tried 'art of' books in the past, but nothing that branches into the many areas that Lo\u00efc has mastered throughout the course of his career. And having been bouncing ideas around with Lo\u00efc for several months about various rewards for backers, we simply couldn't imagine not launching it here to let everyone be a part of this exciting project. What's more, every backer that pledges for a tier with the book will have their name printed inside the book itself! We want Kickstarter backers to feel like a part of this book, because your pledges mean the world to us and to Lo\u00efc.\nWe hope to gain your support so that we can tackle more projects like this in the future with the remarkable artists that we all worship in droves.\nWhy \u00a33,338?\nWe thought you might ask this. Well, since Lo\u00efc's work is quirky and daring, we thought it would be appropriate to reflect this with our Kickstarter funding goal as well. Three-three-three-eight has a nice ring to it! But please don't underestimate us: we have spent many (many!) hours deliberating and calculating the costs of our project, including treatments, pagination, material and shipping costs, as well as covering the expenses of rewards for backers, and we are extremely confident that if we can reach the \u00a33,338 goal then we can bring this fantastic project to the world. So while the \u00a33,338 sounds like a fun figure, it's also a very important sum for us to ensure the project is a success.\nIf this project is successfully funded, the work will get super serious in November: all content already gathered and written will be sub-edited and perfected for print, and all book layouts will be finalised in December. We've already started work on the book, but the outcome of the Kickstarter project will determine whether we can go any further with it.\nThe book will have its final proof in January 2014 before being sent to print. While the book is being printed, packaged and shipped back to the UK, we will be working hard on the extra rewards with Lo\u00efc to ensure they are ready for when the book arrives in the UK in May 2014. We anticipate being able to send all books and rewards in June, but depending on the level of support we received for the project, shipping could extend into July.\n3dtotal Publishing is the maker of a library of successful educational books for digital artists, spanning a variety of subjects from digital painting for beginners to sculpting in ZBrush for professionals. And behind 3dtotal Publishing is the 3dtotal.com website, which has been around for the last 14 years to offer artists and hobbyists helpful free tutorials and insightful articles to aid them with their digital art triumphs.\nWe have already launched 3 successful Kickstarter projects, including the Prime Wars card game, a male anatomy figure for artists, and our most recent was a board game called 404: Law Not Found. Prime Wars and the male anatomy figure projects have both been fulfilled with very happy backers. 404: Law Not Found has just been funded and is now in the heavy production phase.\nLeft: Male anatomy figure. Top: 404: Law Not Found. Bottom: Prime Wars\n\"I'm thrilled to work hand-in-hand with 3dtotal on this art book - it's a 152-page journey into my work and process. In my opinion, 3dtotal is behind some of the best books ever published in our industry; I feel privileged to be picked up for this collaboration where my illustration, 3D and photography can nest into one book.\n\"The pledges we've come up for this project are a complete extension of the book itself. It's like cheese and desert: a book AND some collector prints! It's essentially a great way to get some original artworks and leave with a book on top.\n\"It's also exciting as this will be the first 3D resin cast ever made of my work. So to have it come with 152 pages of goodies on top is awesome!\"\nSpecial thanks go to Lo\u00efc Zimmermann for embarking on this unique project with us, and to Rebekah Tolley for putting the video together for us. Thank you!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe awesome news is that we already know a good thing or two about book publishing, so we have no worries about our abilities when it comes to the printing and production of high-quality art books.\n\nThe obvious challenges with a project like this come down to the rewards for backers, as some of these need to be hand-made and even hand-signed by the artist. While we expect absolutely no problems in the creation of any of these rewards, overwhelming support of the project could mean that it takes a little longer than anticipated to sign all the goodies and hand-make the original works of art for the higher level tiers.\n\nWith that said though, we are very confident that we can deliver exceptional results in good time. We have a fantastic working relationship with Lo\u00efc Zimmermann and we are equally as excited as he is to deliver this incredible project to the world!

For making realistic drawings!\nIt used to be everywhere.\nA portable version hasn\u2019t been manufactured in generations.\nAnd we\u2019re bringing it back.\nReally inexpensively.\nFor artists and art students everywhere.\nWe have designed the NeoLucida: the first portable camera lucida to be manufactured in nearly a century \u2014 and the lowest-cost commercial camera lucida ever designed. We want to make this remarkable device widely available to students, artists, architects, and anyone who loves to draw from life. But to be clear: our NeoLucida is not just a product, but a provocation. In manufacturing a camera lucida for the 21st century, our aim is to stimulate interest in media archaeology\u2014the tightly interconnected history of visual culture and imaging technologies.\nOur project: the NeoLucida, a camera lucida for the 21st century. Shown here is a working prototype, constructed from a combination of mass-manufactured and custom-machined parts.\nWhat is this \"NeoLucida\"?\nThe NeoLucida is a drawing aid that allows you to trace what you see. Our device is the first portable, authentic camera lucida to be manufactured in nearly a century\u2014but we like to think of it as a disruption to widespread assumptions about art-making and art history. Our design is lightweight (9oz., or 0.25kg), sturdy, compact enough to fit in a handbag, highly adjustable, totally non-electronic, and released with a liberal open-source hardware license. It's also the least-expensive camera lucida ever manufactured. If you enjoy drawing from life, or if you're interested in experiencing for yourself how the Old Masters could possibly have created such accurate, lifelike drawings\u2014then the NeoLucida is for you. \nLeft: Our NeoLucida, $40. Right: An antique Camera Lucida (c.1900), about $350 on eBay. Owing to modern innovations such as adjustable gooseneck, the NeoLucida has a considerably simpler design.\nSome background history. \nBeginning in the early 17th century, artists routinely used optical aids to help them create realistic drawings. Lenses and mirrors were the \"cutting edge technology\" of their day (and sometimes, the trade secret) for making life-like images. In 1807, Sir William Hyde Wollaston invented the Camera Lucida\u2014and brought life-drawing to a whole new level. Wollaston's device was simple: a prism on an adjustable stand. When an artist looks down through the prism, they see the world in front of them, plus their hand on the page, combined in perfect superimposition. \nIn short, a camera lucida allows you to trace what you see. And it does so in full daylight; there's no need for a dark shroud or box, as with a Camera Obscura. And that is the magic of the camera lucida: it's portable, easy to use, and\u2014with a little practice\u2014you just copy the world onto your page with a confident hand. \nBy the mid-1800s, camera lucidas were everywhere. Indeed, the device is so effective in assisting accurate life-drawing that, according to the controversial Hockney-Falco hypothesis, it's now believed that many of the most admired drawings of the 19th Century, such as the Neoclassical portraits of Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres, could only have been made with a camera lucida. This becomes astonishingly clear if you try one\u2014an experience we hope to share with as many people as possible, through this Kickstarter.\n(If you'd like to learn more about how the Old Masters likely used optical technologies to create their work, check out David Hockney's book Secret Knowledge, or this terrific BBC documentary (at YouTube) about his research.)\nThe NeoLucida setup: clamp your NeoLucida to a table or drawing board. Place your subject in front, with your paper on the table below the prism. Simply look down into the prism to start drawing.\nPlace your eye close to the prism, looking straight down at the prism's exposed edge, to see a perfect blend of your hand and the scene in front of you.\nOur prototype in action. Here's an unaltered photograph taken through the NeoLucida's eyepiece. The world in front of you is superimposed onto your paper. Just trace what you see!\nNow try this experiment. Go to a group of fine-art students. Find the ones who claim to adore the \"Old Masters\"\u2014and ask them if they\u2019ve ever tried, or even heard of, a camera lucida. We'll bet they haven't (or that they've confused it with the camera obscura). Perhaps it's because a different \"camera\"\u2014the photographic film camera\u2014revolutionized image-making in the intervening century. Once photography became accessible to all, previously common drawing tools like the camera lucida were almost entirely forgotten\u2014and the Old Masters who used them were increasingly believed to have possessed supernatural drawing powers. \nIt hasn't helped that portable camera lucidas have become so rare and costly that most students will never have the chance to try one\u2014not even in an art school. Authentic camera lucidas have become curiosities and fetish objects for antiquarians and professionals, typically costing $300-$500 on eBay. But it's a marvellously simple, useful device\u2014it shouldn't be so exotic!\nSo, why are you doing this? We both have a lot of students who've come to believe that being able to draw photo-realistically is the most important thing. We both love realistic drawing, but not necessarily the way it\u2019s usually taught\u2014which often ignores the tightly-intertwined relationship between drawing and imaging technologies. In particular, art students are encouraged to draw photo-realistically, in the manner of the Old Masters, but without the proper tools for doing so. So we're producing the NeoLucida as a provocation, not as a business, to help get this discussion started. We hope the NeoLucida will prompt new questions about the relationship of art and technology\u2014and potentially even disrupt business-as-usual in the classroom. Most importantly, we genuinely believe that using a camera lucida will profoundly change how people see, how they draw, and how they think about art. \nPortraits by Pablo, created with an antique camera lucida (c.1900, left), and the NeoLucida (right).\nOur Plan.\nWait: aren't there modern, competing products?\nWe wouldn't be doing this if there were any modern-day camera lucidas that met our criteria for easy portability, low cost, and authentic optical design. Unfortunately, there aren't. For example, the LUCID-Art costs $200, weighs four times as much as the NeoLucida, and can't fit in a handbag. Likewise, the LUCI costs more than twice as much as ours; it's bulky, and difficult to adjust. And because the LUCI uses a mirror instead of a prism, you have to draw everything upside-down! (With ours, you draw right-side-up.) Amazingly, these are the only camera lucidas currently being manufactured today\u2014and neither uses the elegant and compact optical design employed throughout the 19th century.\nDesign and Production.\nWe know that for a young artist to even consider experimenting with a camera lucida, it has to be inexpensive. So we\u2019ve designed the NeoLucida to consist almost entirely of prefabricated parts made in China (such as the clamp, prism, and flexible gooseneck mount), and available through business-to-business marketplaces like Alibaba. The only custom pieces (in the optics mount) have been designed by our expert friends at StandardRobot, a Pittsburgh-based mechatronics studio, and will be machined right here in the U.S.A. For both international and domestic parts, we\u2019ve already received multiple bids from different suppliers, and have factored the costs of shipping and customs into our reckoning. \nOur design is complete. We've learned a ton about the Chinese component marketplace. We\u2019ve made and tested several working prototypes, and we're ready to fufill our dream of getting inexpensive camera lucidas into the hands of lots of people. But to do this at all, we have to meet our suppliers\u2019 minimum order requirements\u2014usually, depending on the component, at least 500 pieces. If we can raise 500 orders, then our dream can be your reality! The NeoLucidas themselves will be assembled at Golan\u2019s studio in Pittsburgh, with the assistance of some careful students.\nThis is a Limited Run of Open Source Hardware.\nOur first batch of NeoLucidas will also be our only batch\u2014because, as we\u2019ve explained, we\u2019re doing this as a fun intervention, not to start a business. Once we\u2019ve finished distributing the NeoLucidas, we will publish our designs, CAD files, and all of our supplier data with a liberal Creative Commons and Open-Source Hardware (OSHW) license, so that anyone who wishes can continue the project (including, potentially, commercially). Our design and other manufacturing information will appear on NeoLucida.com, Instructables, Scribd, and other appropriate sites. We hope others will be inspired to pick up where we leave off!\nYour own NeoLucida. \nIf you support our project at the $40 level or higher, you'll get one NeoLucida in a draw-string pouch, plus instructions on using and caring for your device. The cost of shipping (within the US) is included.\nSo how is your NeoLucida \u201cprism-on-a-stick\u201d manufactured? We use a silvered prism, optimized for optical clarity, carefully encased in a custom anodized aluminum mount. The prism is supported by a highly adjustable gooseneck arm and a sturdy metal clamp. We even use a 1/4\u201d-20 threaded bolt as the connection between the gooseneck arm and the prism holder\u2014so your NeoLucida arm can easily double as a standard camera mount. All this is hand-assembled in Pittsburgh before being carefully packaged and sent off to you. Open it up and start drawing right away!\nBut there's more. Beyond just making a device for your use, we really want to see what you draw with your NeoLucida. In some ways, this is the true heart of our project. That\u2019s why every recipient of a NeoLucida will also receive a postage-prepaid blank postcard. And a NeoLucida pencil, too. Make a drawing with your NeoLucida, pop the card in the mail, and your drawing may end up in a published collection of NeoLucida drawings!\nCan I get more than one? Unfortunately not, per Kickstarter's \"Single Serving rule\" for rewards in the Product Design category. If, however, you're interested in classroom packs or other wholesale arrangements, please contact us privately. \nBacked by Primary Research.  \nSo, how are we qualified to do this, and why are we confident? We're both art professors and have spent the bulk of our careers using both modern and historical imaging technologies. Sure, most artists have used digital cameras\u2014but we've logged tons of hours with concave mirrors, large biconvex lenses, camera obscuras and camera lucidas.\nSelections from Pablo Garcia's personal collection of vintage camera lucidas.\nPablo using one of his antique camera lucidas, Iceland, 2010.\nExamples of Pablo's camera lucida drawings, 2010.\nPablo has spent a dozen years drawing with his camera lucida. Since acquiring his first one in 2001, he has also amassed one of the world's largest collections of primary and secondary research into the technology and history of this device. Pablo's collection includes many of the most important books, patents, articles, schematics, and contemporary accounts of the camera lucida. \nPossibly the best evidence that we're qualified to conduct this project is Pablo\u2019s personal collection of antique camera lucidas. Over the course of a decade, he has acquired the best examples of original camera lucidas throughout history. In his collection are devices from 1820, 1840, 1860, 1880, 1900, 1930, and several versions sold as children's drawing aids from the 1940s through the 1960s. This collection is one of the most complete primary resources on the technology around\u2014and served as the research foundation for our design of the NeoLucida.\nWho are we?\nPablo Garcia and Golan Levin are university art professors and new-media artists, with a strong shared interest in the history and poetics of imaging technologies.\nPablo Garcia (@prgarc) is Assistant Professor of Contemporary Practices at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. Trained as an architect, Pablo's recent work has evolved from design-for-hire to internationally exhibited artworks, provocations and research studies. His work has appeared on FastCompany/Co.Design, io9, ArtInfo, ThisIsColossal, Gizmodo, Make, The Creators Project and many others. Previously, Pablo has taught at Carnegie Mellon, Parsons, University of Michigan, and Princeton. From 2004-2007, he also worked as an architect and designer for Diller Scofidio + Renfro.\nGolan Levin (@golan) is Associate Professor of Computation Arts at Carnegie Mellon University; a member of the Free Art and Technology artist collective; and an enthusiastic Kickstarter supporter. At CMU, he also directs the Frank-Ratchye STUDIO for Creative Inquiry, a laboratory for anti-disciplinary research across the arts, sciences, technology, and culture. A two-time TED speaker, Golan has been called one of \"50 Designers Shaping the Future\" by Fast Company Magazine, an \"A-OK guy\" by Bruce Sterling, and a lot of other things. \nWe're also greatly indebted to our tireless research assistant Sarah Keeling, who has spent long nights communicating with Chinese vendors; to our expert mechanical engineer, Greg Baltus, of StandardRobot; to Benji Welmond, a talented filmmaker who has assisted with our videography, and to the staff of the Frank-Ratchye STUDIO for Creative Inquiry, who have supported our research in numerous other ways. \nOpen Source.\nThe NeoLucida will be wholly Open Source Hardware (OSHW), and will be released with documentation (including all CAD files) according to the definitions, standards and recommendations of the Open Source Hardware Association.\nQuestions?\nAsk away!

We are not only leveraging the Chinese factory system, with its standard parts ready for shipping, but also small, American design and fabrication companies with proven track records. This gives us the best of both worlds, allowing us to combine inexpensive components with custom components where appropriate.\n\nShould manufacturing issues arise, we have several options for local fabrication companies in Pittsburgh and Chicago. Finding alternate sources for the custom parts is not as difficult as it was ten years ago. These digitally-driven fabrication methods are now common industry standards. \n\nIn addition, we have both spent decades providing technical solutions to creative problems. Pablo was trained as an architect and designer and has spent over a decade working with digital fabrication equipment. Golan is a new media artist who has created and deployed robust, technically sophisticated installations all over the world.

You will receive these as they are finished, also as digital downloads. This will be a kickstarter exclusive! You will hear it first! So tell your friends! Share this page! AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT from the bottom of our hearts!!!!!!!!\nStory:\nWe were cooking breakfast one day at our family home, listening to records and singing along. We'd been on a year-long break from touring and recording, which followed 2 full years on the road, and were gearing up to start working on music again. Someone put on a compilation called \"The Everly Brothers: Original Greatest Hits,\" and we had, some might say, an aha moment.\nSee, we are sisters. People always say to us that sibling harmonies are the sweetest, which we take both as a compliment and as a dismissal, as in, \"of course you can sing like that together, you're sisters.\" But in listening to that particular album on that particular morning we had the same reaction. Only siblings could sing like they do, and we wanted to learn from their tricks, their nuances, their harmonic ideas and songwriting mastery.\nWe've spent our lives as 2 out of 3 sisters. Our band originally included our sister Jessica, and she left a couple years ago to have a baby. Our general response to 2-part harmony has always been to sing the third part, to create the triad that was suggested by its absence. Our early songwriting and arranging was all constructed for three. But now that we're a duo it's different, we have more harmonic choices, we seek the 2 notes out of the chord that evoke the essence of the triad, and the longing of what's missing. The Everly Brothers were masters of this, and singing their songs with their harmonies has been a kind of master class in our own genre.\nWithin a month we had put together a band of NY musicians, rented studio time, picked 14 songs from the Everlys' vast catalog of amazing singles and recorded everything live in Thump Studios in Greenpoint, Brooklyn \u2014 all 14 tracks in about 6 hours. Over the course of the summer we sent the tracks out to 4 different mixers, did some overdubs of theremin, and some extra harmonies on a couple songs (we couldn't resist completely!), did a photoshoot where we dressed up as Phil and Don and recreated some of their iconic album covers, started playing live again, and with your help are finally putting this record out in April!!!!!!!!\nWho we are:\nWe are Abigail and Lily Chapin, sisters in life and music. We have released 2 critically acclaimed albums of original material, 2008's \"Lake Bottom LP\":\n\"The one virtue LA trio the Chapin Sisters shares with classic sister acts of old becomes apparent when they sing together; that shiver of spotless, familial unity that makes every syllable woundingly poignant.\" - Flavorpill\nand 2010's \"Two\": \n\"More like a distaff Lennon/McCartney than a traditional sibling act.\u201d - Steve Horowitz, Popmatters\nWhile we think of ourselves as songwriters, we're no stranger to interpreting our favorite songs; Our first ever foray into recording under the moniker The Chapin Sisters was in 2004 when our brother Jonathan and his friend Michael 'Fitz and the Tantrums' Fitzpatrick brought us into the studio to create ghostly harmonic versions of five radio hits. Our version of Britney Spears' \"Toxic\" from that session became a hit in its own right on LA's famed KCRW before our band had even played one show. We've also sang background vocals on countless albums, getting an early start on our Dad (and 3-time Grammy award winner) Tom Chapin's kids records at ages 6 and 8.\nWe sang backups for She & Him on their world tour for Vol. 2 in 2010-11, pulling double-duty opening the shows as the Chapin Sisters, too.\nWe are currently playing shows around NYC, (our re-adopted home, after living for the past 7 years in Los Angeles) while working on new songs for an upcoming record.\nLily and Abigail during the Tom Chapin 'Family Tree' Sessions\nHow you can Help:\nWhen we set out on this project, we thought we would put it out digitally and move on to the next thing, but these songs have grabbed us, and we love this album. We want you to listen to it on vinyl, as we listened to that Everly Brothers greatest hits album that inspired this whole thing. We want to play shows as the Everlys with our amazing full band, maybe at your house or your wedding. We want to be directly connected with you, our fans, fans of the Everly Brothers, and of music in general. We want to hand craft each CD cover for you individually, and tie dye each tote bag. We want to sing backups on YOUR record. And we want the world to have another moment to appreciate these brothers Phil and Don who changed the course of rock n' roll forever, influencing our culture in ways that leave us in awe.\nWhere will the money go?:\nYes, the recording process is finished, and we can say with certainty that we love how this record sounds. But how will the record look, feel? This is a completely independent project. We are our own record label, \"Lake Bottom Records,\" and putting out a record costs money that we don't have.\nWe will use this money to pay our musicians, most of whom played on this record for free out of the kindness of their hearts. We will use it to print up beautiful 180-gram vinyl records, pressed at the legendary Furnace Factory, with gorgeous album artwork and photographs by Seth Thomas. We will use it to pay for CD duplication and supplies for our hand-made CD covers. We will use it to pay mechanicals to Don and Phil Everly and Felice and Boudleaux Bryant for use of their songs. We will use it to promote the record, and make sure it is heard by the people who want to hear it.\nTrack List:\nCrying in the Rain\nBrand New Heartache\nSleepless Nights\nSigh, Cry, Almost Die\nCathy's Clown\nSo Sad (to watch good love go bad)\nAll I Have to Do is Dream\nWhen Will I Be Loved\nSome Sweet Day\nLove Hurts\nAlways it's You\nDown in the Willow Garden\nTill I Kissed You\nMaybe Tomorrow", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe risks on this project are low- the album exists and we can send it to you digitally whether the project gets funded or not.

It took more than 200 hours to design, build, and finish. We enjoyed every minute of it.\nIn the year 2108, an airborne virus, known as ADM-12, plagues the human race, causing sudden dementia and severe psychosis amongst its hosts.\nWhile renowned neurologists repeatedly failed for years in finding a cure, Robotics & Neuromech scientist Dr. Akira Behr developed an artificial brain capable of bypassing the disease\u2019s destructive path.\nHowever, days before the first human trials, he was captured and betrayed by the very organization that hired him to solve the global crisis; but not before he discreetly transferred his mind into the artificial brain of his daughter\u2019s stuffed bear.\nTwenty years has since passed and his precious creation is now being used for world domination. As the end is nearing, a young man named Keane stumbles upon the forgotten toy and awakens Dr. Behr. Together, they search for his daughter and fight to stop the organization that double-crossed him.\nIt took well over 200 hours to design PapaBehr in CAD based off of our initial sketches and over 150 hours to grow the prototype in the 3D printer.

Their love for toys, sci-fi, animation, and gaming, inspired the creation of PapaBehr. \nWe'd also like to thank Brian Caruso, Vincent Smuda, Jeff Kwok, Kim Yee, Casey Yam, Jason Lam, Hai Le and the many others that helped on and supported this project!  And a big thanks to the Reddit community for the encouragement and for suggesting Kickstarter to us! \nFAQ:\nWhy a USB toy?\n\nSince our jobs require us to spend hours sitting at our desks, we wanted to come up with the perfect desktop companion that could accompany us and complement our workspace. But we didn\u2019t want PapaBehr to just be eye candy, we wanted him to have some function along with its form. So, along with being a badass office warrior, he\u2019s also a USB stick.\nThe USB was also incorporated to reference PapaBehr\u2019s data storing capabilities from the story. In the plot, PapaBehr cannibalizes enemy robot weapons and data to become a more formidable killing machine.\nWhy Magnets?\nBecause magnets are cool. And because we wanted to make the armour and sword detachable without the use conventional clips to snap it on. The magnets also allows us to make interchangeable armour and weapon sets. But seriously, magnets are awesome.\nWill the magnets harm the USB drive? \nNope! A magnetic field such as from a magnet will not harm a USB drive. The data on the USB drive is held in the form of an electric charge which would only be affected by a very, very strong field (more than a magnet can produce). \n\"There's nothing magnetic in flash memory, so [a magnet] won't do anything,\" says Bill Frank, executive director of the CompactFlash Association. \"A magnet powerful enough to disturb the electrons in flash would be powerful enough to suck the iron out of your blood cells,\" says Frank.\nYay Science!\nWhy only the 8GB and 16GB sizes? Why not bigger? \nEventually we want to offer larger capacities, but for now we just want to test the market and see how it goes. If all goes well, we want to start planning to make bigger toys that involve actual hard drives!\nWhat are we going to do with the funding?\nThe funds will be used for production and distribution costs! We're currently in talks with a few manufacturers. The molds are pretty pricey and so are USBs. So with your help, we can get these bad boys in production!\nWhy does he look so angry? Why can't he be smiling and be super cute?\nFor some reason this is a question that's frequently being asked (mainly by females). The reason he looks so unhappy is because he use to be a human man before having to transfer his mind into a toy bear to avoid death from the organization that hired him to save the world. So he's pretty mad about that. He's also pretty angry because he has awoken 20 years later to a world that's been destroyed by a weapon that he pretty much invented. And on top of that, his daughter was taken from him and he has no idea where she is or if she's alive. So to sum up: man turned toy bear in fear of death, betrayed by company, in a coma for 20 years, world is now destroyed because of his invention, and daughter is missing. \n...But maybe we'll try to make a happy version later. \nWill PapaBehr's USB fit into my computer?\nYes! We are currently working a solution to make sure that PapaBehr's USB will fit into all computer sizes. At first we were focusing more form over function, but we want to accomodate everyone. We'll keep everyone updated on the solution!\nUPDATE: So far, we're playing with this possible solution. \nDoes \"WHOA BEAST!\" mode ($500 pledge) include accessories and shipping on future toys?\nFor this pledge, you will receive every toy (including accessories like weapon and armour sets)! This will also include docking stations etc. \nShipping is not included on these future toys, only on the toys released in the Kickstarter. As much as we'd love to ship these out to you guys for free, it definitely adds up - especially the international shipping! \nDoes the pledge price include US domestic Shipping? \nIt has come to our attention that we\u2019ve made a mistake by not adding the US domestic shipping cost to the pledge price. We thought that this could be handled at the end of the campaign with the survey, but apparently we had to include it in the initial pledge price. We apologize for this mistake! This is our first time creating a Kickstarter so we made a rookie boo-boo. For those of you that require US domestic shipping, can you please add the following shipping costs to your respective pledge:\n\u201cTrainee\u201d mode ($10 Pledge): Add $3.00\n\u201cEasy\u201d mode ($15 Pledge): Add $5.00\n\u201cNovice\u201d mode ($25 Pledge): Add $5.00\n\u201cStarter\u201d mode ($30 Pledge): Add $5.00\n\u201cNormal\u201d mode ($35 Pledge): Add $5.00\n\u201cIntermediate\u201d mode ($40 Pledge): Add $5.00\n\u201cAdvanced\u201d mode ($45 Pledge): Add $5.00\n\u201cHeroic\u201d mode ($100 Pledge): Add $10.00\n\u201cHardcore\u201d mode ($150 Pledge): Add $10.00\n\u201cInsane\u201d mode ($250 Pledge): FREE\n\u201cWHOA! BEAST\u201d mode ($500 Pledge): FREE\n\u201cLegendary\u201d mode ($1000 Pledge): FREE\nWe\u2019re really, really sorry for this oversight and inconvenience. We hope this mistake doesn't cause any of you to drop out. We hope you guys understand.\nWould it be possible to get two painted PapaBehrs instead of one 'DIY PapaBehr' for the 'Heroic' mode pledges and up? \nYes, absolutely. At the end of the campaign we're sending out a survey, so we can make that adjustment then. Just add $5.00 and make a note that you want two painted PapaBehrs!\nAnd others!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nA big challenge for us will definitely come with working with the manufacturer to ensure the highest of quality in every toy. We're a very detail-orientated bunch, so quality in the mold, painting, and assembling is a big thing to us. PapaBehr is a pretty intricate toy for it's size and it has a lot of detachable parts. We want to make sure that it comes out correctly. We've already spent a lot of time readjusting the CAD for mold production. The USB aspect of this toy is a risk as well. We'll have to test every USB to make sure that they work and are of the correct capacity. Another challenge will be to meet the deadlines. Production is new to us and we want to make sure that we're releasing an awesome figurine that meets our high standards. We are going to work closely with the manufacturer to make sure that everything is running smoothly and that high quality toys are being made. We'll keep everyone updated on the process so that we're all on the same page!

No problem! We'll continue to take preorders (and once it's printed, we'll have information on where you can buy it) - just check out http://www.cantripgames.com/storywar!\nStory War is a storytelling party game for 3 to 8 players. Players split into teams and take control of classic characters like Puss In Boots or a fire-breathing Dragon and use creativity and humor to defeat the opposing team.\nIn most other games the difference between victory and defeat has a lot to do with numbers; the story itself is secondary. But in Story War controlling the narrative is the only way to win. There are no numbers or rules on the cards, only artwork and hilarious descriptions. It's up to the players to decide how to interpret their powers, which means that every game tells unique stories based on the collective creativity of everyone involved.\nHow does it work?\nEach turn represents one battle between two teams of players. The setting is defined by a randomly drawn Battlefield card. Players then look at the Warrior cards and Item cards in their hands and try to come up with a clever strategy. Once every player has played their Warrior cards face-down, everyone flips their cards over simultaneously. Then players must quickly describe, in an open discussion, how their team would defeat the opposing team.\nEach battle is moderated by a judge that rotates every turn (similar to Apples to Apples) so the shared pop cultural context of everyone in the room is very important! Harry Potter fans might play the Basilisk card differently than Percy Jackson fans. Pokemon fans can cite obscure typing match-ups to explain why you can't punch a bird. Dungeons and Dragons players will often overlay D&D rules onto the game - don't even try to convince a D&D-playing judge that the Giant can defeat the Dwarf!\nPlayers are also free to make stuff up, as long as they can be convincing! Everything is being moderated by a judge so if your opponent claims their character is unrealistically powerful, you can challenge that claim. Once a challenge has been issued the judge has to immediately decide whether or not it's a valid move. This means your characters are able to do anything as long as the judge lets you get  away with it! The player acting as the judge and the grouping of teams changes after every turn, so the social dynamic is always shifting! Each battle ultimately evolves into an organic story and a memorable shared experience.\nWhat kind of stories are told?\nStory War was designed from the ground up with inclusiveness in mind. It can be played by anyone and different groups will tell different kinds of stories. If you're playing with gamers the stories are often more combat focused and if you're playing with writers, stories tend to be more character-driven.\nWhen you play Story War with young kids, then you'll likely end up telling G-rated stories. But if you're playing with just adults, the stories can become serious, inappropriate and often very scientific - can Midas turn a Ghost into gold? (Story War also makes a great drinking game!)\nHere's some examples of some great stories that happened in playtesting:\n\"The Lich is the Lady Gaga of the underworld and used her Twitter followers to attack her hater: a Zombie.\" (played by @LeiaJ)\n\"The Leprechaun created so much gold that gold became worthless and his society became isolationist and crumbled.\" (played by Brad)\n\"The Imp used the Philosopher's Stone to transform the air around the Fairy into a bottle - a bottle is the Fairy's nemesis!\" (played by Nick)\n\"The Treant was a Tree of Cheem from Doctor Who. It was protected by The Doctor because it's a space minority.\" (played by Khadijah)\n\"The Mimic put on the Mythril Tux to go to a party with other classic D&D characters but he got kicked out because he's always getting drunk and throwing up treasure and everyone hates him.\" (played by strangers)\nWe've playtested Story War hundreds of times with a diverse balance of ages, genders, and skills. Our objective was to make every card as interesting and useful as possible while also keeping the game accessible to anyone. It's a game that you can pull out of your pocket in front of a group of friends (or strangers) and within minutes everyone will be laughing and having fun.\nWho is making Story War?\nCantrip Games! Which consists of Tom McLean, Brad O'Farrell and Vondell Swain. The initial concept came from months of Tom and Brad prototyping and play-testing different card game ideas until we found something interesting. We knew Story War would require fantastic character design skills and hundreds of pieces of art so we hired Vondell Swain, who is only 19 years old but annoyingly talented at everything. We've spent the last 6 months writing, drawing, designing and playtesting. Now we need your help to finally publish Story War!\nBy becoming a backer of Story War, you'll get to have creative input on the expansion cards! We'll be posting unfinished sketches and concepts in our backers-only update section and welcoming feedback. Story War is a game for everybody, so it's really helpful for us to gather feedback from as many people as possible.\nBut also, backers get cool stuff! Read the list of options on the right side of the page for a full list of rewards. Here is more information about those rewards:\nPrint-and-Play Pack\nFor $10, you'll get a \"print-and-play\" PDF containing all the cards in Story War that you can print out on your own as soon as the campaign ends! (This PDF will also be available at all higher reward tiers.)\nBasic Pack\nFor $25, we'll ship you a physical copy of the Story War base set, which contains 100 cards and the rules. This set is already finished so we'll begin printing it as soon as the campaign ends. This is the game we've spent the last 6 months developing, and it includes cards such as:\nWarriors: Lich, Puss In Boots, Cherub\nBattlefields: Beanstalk, Capital City, Sky Port\nItems: Shrink Ray, Flame Bow, Bramble Seed\nHero Pack\nFor $40 you'll be sent a copy of the Story War base set as soon as it's printed and you'll also get a second shipment containing the expansion deck once it's completed. The expansion deck is less focused on Greek mythology and fairytales and more focused on Asian mythology, science fiction, and niche fantasy concepts.\nThe expansion deck will include at least 50 cards, but we'll add more cards as we get more funding! It will hopefully be expanded to 100 extra cards if we reach our funding goals!  We'll be able to develop the expansion deck much faster than the original deck because we'll have more resources and we'll be able to hire additional artists. But we've already begun working on it! Here are some of the cards it will include:\nWarriors: Oni (a Japanese demon), Kraken, Kami (a Japanese spirit)\nBattlefields: Lunar Colony, Labyrinth, Mystery Mansion \nItems: Philosopher's Stone, Bottomless Top Hat, Super Cape\nDeluxe Pack\nFor $60 you'll get everything listed above AND your copy of Story War will include a bunch of cool comics and exclusive cards! We've added a LOT to the Deluxe Pack since the project launched and unfortunately we can't edit the reward description. But if you back at $60, you won't just get the 5 cards mentioned in the reward description, you'll get ALL of the cards shown below:\nThese licensed cards are Kickstarter exclusives and they will NOT be sold later. The only way we're allowed to make them is as Kickstarter rewards.\nYou'll also get a bunch of \"blank\" cards - that is, cards you can write and draw on and shuffle into your Story War deck! They have the same backing as regular cards, so you can use them just as you would use any other card.\nCustom Cards\nFor $100 or more we'll make a custom card, just for you! Read the reward descriptions on the side-bar for more details! The lowest tier for custom cards is $100, where we'll redraw the Witch or Wizard card to resemble you. At the highest tier, we'll make a custom card based on you that will be included in EVERYBODY's copy of the expansion - the Dwarf card is an example of a card that's based on a real person (Brad O'Farrell, the creator of Story War!)\nShipping\nShipping is included in the cost of the cards, but backers outside the US will have to pay an additional $10. Story War will be printed immediately after this campaign ends and be shipped as soon as it's printed. But the Expansion Deck and any custom cards will be shipped separately  a few months later, after they've been completed.\nTo avoid paying for international shipping twice, we'll hold international orders until the complete order has arrived; if you're an international backer and you'd prefer two shipments instead of one delayed shipment please add an additional $10 to your order.\nStory War is already finished. We've spent the last 6 months playtesting, writing, and illustrating cards, printing prototype copies, and paying our artist out of pocket. We have a complete game of 100 cards and it's super fun! We only need $20,000 to recoup our losses and print the first run of the game. But if we raise over  $20,000, there are so many awesome things we could add to Story War!\nWhat would additional funds add to the game?\nExpansion Deck: We're planning to make at least 50 extra cards for the Expansion Deck, but we'd love to make a full 100 card expansion! That would mean, when combined with the base set, there'd be a full 200 cards! More cards means more random match-ups, which means greater variety between games! \nGame Modes: We've only ever playtested the game using a single set of rules, but we designed the cards to work with a lot of different styles of play. Game Modes would be new rules that you could print out and use with the standard Story War cards. If we raise enough money we'll develop these new Game Modes and distribute them for free.\nCampaigns: Campaigns are one-time-use stories that involve unexpected plot twists that affect the gameplay! These would also be distributed for free. A campaign would be printed out and given to a player who would act as the judge for the entire game. Think of it like watching a suspenseful movie with your friends, but you're also controlling what happens next!\nOnline Multiplayer Client: Story War actually started out as an online game that we first playtested using a chatroom robot. We decided to develop Story War into a card game for simplicity, but we always knew we wanted to ultimately make an online version. Everyone involved in this card game is also a video game programmer and we're very capable of making a high quality online version of Story War. We think the best implementation might be a webcam-based game using Google Plus Hangouts. But doing so would take a lot of time and energy and resources, so we've set it as our highest goal.\nHere are the milestones we're hoping to reach:\nFUNDED! Thank you so much everybody! The game is definitely going to ship now! We've also unlocked at least 50 cards for the expansion deck! More will be unlocked as we reach our stretch goals!\nWhoa! We hit our first stretch goal way faster than expected! This means the number of cards in the expansion (for everybody who backed with $40 or more) increases from 50 to 60! If we reach all of our stretch goals, the expansion will be a full 100 card deck!\nAwesome, our first game mode has been unlocked! \nIt's called Myth Master! It uses all the same cards as Story War and is structured similarly, the key difference is that you are playing as yourself manifested into the battlefield and you are summoning Warriors from the cards in your hand. The ultimate objective isn\u2019t just to take out the other player\u2019s Warriors, it\u2019s to take out the human player who is controlling them, just like in Magic the Gathering, YuGiOh, and the Pokemon manga*!\nSo now that we\u2019ve hit $30k, I\u2019m going to spend the next few weeks playtesting the Myth Master rule set and refining it and then packaging it in an easy-to-understand PDF rule sheet that you can print out for free!\n(* in the Pokemon manga the objective of battle is often to kill the other trainer, it\u2019s pretty metal)\nAwesome, 10 more expansion cards added! We're now up to 70 cards in the expansion deck! But we also have a SPECIAL SURPRISE:\nWe've teamed up with our KICKSTARTER PALS, the Machine of Death, to release a cross-over game mode these special bonus cards only available to backers of both projects:\nThe Machine of Death card in Story War can be used to predict your opponent\u2019s death with just a single drop of blood; the Story War card in Machine of Death can be used to redeem something from a fairy tale. Both cards stand alone as usable items in both games, but they become even cooler when you combine the two games!\nCan a vampire die of cancer? What if it\u2019s sunlight from the Cancer constellation? Using the Machine of Death\u2019s cause-of-death predictions on fantasy characters adds a whole new level of creative challenge to the gameplay of both games! We\u2019ll post more about the crossover rules later on in the campaign!\nWow, we just hit our $40k stretch goal, which unlocks a 5 pack of campaigns! What are campaigns? They\u2019re a single sheet of rule variations that you can print out and read from top to bottom as you play the game. Here\u2019s some examples of what a campaign could contain:\nA choose-your-own adventure style storyline, that uses cards from the player\u2019s hands to fill in unknown variables, where the story\u2019s path changes depending on the outcome of the battle!\nA list of 20 numbered alternate victory conditions for battle (\u201cWoo the princess!\u201d \u201cWin an election!\u201d \u201cDefeat the opponent without drawing blood!\u201d \u201cWin a go-kart race!\u201d) that you could use with a 20-sided die!\nA one-time-use storyline that plays out like an elaborate shaggy dog story with a big twist at the end!\n\nThe best thing about campaigns? We\u2019ll be releasing some that we make ourselves, but players are free to create their own and share them with other players! We\u2019ll even come up with a convenient way for players to share their campaigns with one another.\nHow\u2019s that for re-playability?\nWait we - somehow hit THREE stretch goals in a single 24 hour period? How is that possible! So at $45k we unlock another 10 cards for the expansion, bringing us up to 80 expansion cards! There's only two stretch goals left before we have a full 100 card expansion deck!\nWe've also figured out a good solution for scaling up art production for our higher level reward tiers, so we've DOUBLED the number of available Magic Packs, which continues to be one of our most popular rewards!\nWhoa, we're halfway to $100k! That's so awesome!\nAt $50k we\u2019ve unlocked a new game mode called Conquest Kingdoms. This is a pretty big deviation from the way Story War is typically played! We wanted to make a game mode that focuses on Battlefield cards as more than just a background thing. So we came up with this idea: Let each team choose a Battlefield card that is treated as a base that the other team must capture. That means things like structural stability and environmental advantages and potential booby traps really come into play!\nOutside of the overall concept (which sounds super fun!) the specific rules for this mode are still up in the air! But now that we\u2019ve gotten $50k in funding, we can afford to actually playtest it and find the best possible rules! Once we\u2019ve finalized the rules for the Conquest Kingdoms game mode, we\u2019ll release them online for free as a downloadable PDF!\nWow! Heck! Wow! We went from $40k to $60k in 24 hours! Do you know what that means? We gained the entire necessary funding amount in a single day! The whole $20k, wow!\nWe also added 10 cards to the expansion, bringing us up to 90! If you want to join the discussion which cards we add to the expansion, head over to the comments section on update #7!\nHoly cow! $70k! in the first 10 days! That means we've unlocked new campaigns written by Cantrip Games, but ALSO we have an exciting announcement relating to campaigns:\nWe're going to build a website where users can write their own interactive campaigns that can be viewed on mobile devices. That is to say, when you're playing Story War with your friends in real life, someone could load CantripGames.com on their smart phone and you'll be able to jump right into alternate game modes and rules that are displayed right there on your phone! No printing necessary! Online campaigns can even even contain interactive components and rich media, like photos, video, and branching story paths.\nWe'll be putting all of our campaigns online for free, and also offer printable versions of ones that would make sense as printed versions. We're also going to make it so users can post their campaigns online for free! It's going to be really cool!\nWow, $80k, that means the expansion is complete! We now have a FULL 100 card expansion! This means you can play the expansion as its own game! We'll develop the expansions with the input from our backers, so be sure to check the updates section for more details! \n\"Objection! It's impossible that my client, the Vampire, could've killed the victim - the crime HAD to have taken place during the DAYTIME!\"\nTrial Tales is a Story War game mode we're developing that turns the concept of \"proving your character can defeat another character\" on it's head - instead the objective is to prove your innocence! It's like Nursrey Crimes meets Phoenix Wright!\nThe players on the left and right of the current judge act as the Attorney and Prosecutor who must defend Warrior cards that represent their client and the victim, respectively. Each subsequent player is a witness/suspect. The Battlefield cards art as crime scenes, and the Item cards act as evidence!\nStory War is largely about choosing your Warrior cards, but Trial Tales is all about evidence (Item cards). The prosecutor and defense attorney will have a hand full of evidence cards that they could choose to play or not to play, based on which ones they think would better suit their narrative. Remember, even if you're the one who submits an Item into evidence, it can still be used against you by the other side!\nWe'll be playtesting this mode until we have a solid set of rules nailed down, then we'll release those rules for free. Also $90k! We had a huge bump this week thanks to Hank and Emmy!\nHey, it\u2019s Tom here! Shortly after Brad pitched me the idea for Story War, I threw together an IRC bot that could play it. (IRC is a really old chat platform that nowadays is only really used by hackers and time travellers from the 90s) Even with no art, hastily-scrawled descriptions, and totally un-thought-out characters and locations, we realised this game was a blast.\nIt turns out that a heck of a lot of you think it\u2019s a pretty cool game idea, too, because as of just a little while ago two-and-a-bit thousand of you have helped us hit our $100k stretch goal - and we\u2019re not even halfway into the campaign yet! Amazing!\nSo, it means that, once the Kickstarter wraps up, I\u2019m going to start bringing this old IRC bot into the twenty tens, including lovely graphics, chat, and video! At the moment we\u2019re looking at building it as an add-on to Google+ Hangouts, which means the webcam-based communication elements will already be there for us; we\u2019ve just got to get the game happening!\nIt\u2019s going to be a fair bit of work, so it certainly not going to be live when the kickstarter ends or anything (plus I\u2019ve got to put together the print-and-play stuff first!), but we\u2019ll keep you posted on the progress. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll end up playing it with at least some of you, so I look forward to seeing you on Google+!\nWow, we hit that stretch goal super fast! To celebrate, here are a preview of four of our favorite items in the base set!\nNow that we've hit the \"base set upgrade\" we're going to include some of the features of the DELUXE PACK in the BASIC PACK: The basic pack will now include a sampling of blank cards that users can draw on, as well as it's own mini-comic that will contain different comics from the DELUXE PACK version. These rewards *stack* too, so if you ordered the DELUXE PACK you're also getting everything in the BASIC PACK as well, which means you'll have even more blank cards and even more comics.\n\"Medusa and the Gargoyle would be a PERFECT couple, come on! He's already stone, so she can't turn him to stone and her snake hair can't hurt him. His cold priestly heart would be warmed by her fiery diva attitude. Plus they look so cute together!\"\nKiss & Make Up is our newest game mode - another way to play with the Story War cards. Rather than trying to figure out \"who would win in a fight\" you're trying to convince another player to go out with you in a sea of competing suitors.\nIt's structured similar to The Bachelor - the 'judge' has a Warrior card that everyone else is trying to woo. Then every other player makes their case for why their Warrior is the best match for the judge's Warrior - and they can use Battlefield cards to suggest date locations, and Item cards as romantic gifts.\nThe Warriors are all fighters, the Items art mostly weapons, and the Battlefields are pretty hazardous - but volatile creatures need love too! Isn't that the whole point of Sex And The City?\nThe weekly webcomic has been unlocked! Which means we're going to start posting weekly comics featuring the Story War characters on the Cantrip Games blog! Comics will often be based on actual battles and they can even be submitted by players themselves! The whole world is a writer's room - any time you're playing a game of Story War, every single turn has the potential to become a comic that can be disseminated to other Story War fans. So that's pretty cool!\nStory War hit $180k last night, which means we\u2019ve unlocked a new Game Mode called Hero\u2019s Saga!\nThe basic idea is this: Rather than playing as a new Warrior every round, you play through the entire game as a single Warrior who gets stronger after every battle. There are two ways your Warrior can get stronger: By acquiring \u201cSkill Cards\u201d which are Warrior cards interpreted as learned abilities (for example, if you play the Red Dragon as a Skill Card on your Witch you could reasonably argue it gives her the power to cast fire spells) and by acquiring Item cards that could be re-used in every future battle without penalty.\nThis is our most ambitious and complex Game Mode yet! Once we\u2019ve thoroughly playtested it and worked out all the kinks, we\u2019ll release the rules as a free PDF to all of our backers!\nThat's it, that's the animated short. No I'm kidding the real animated short will be much more animated and much less short. But I am fairly certain it'll star these characters, all of whom have turned out to be fan favorites. We're already talking to some animators and voice actors and music people and animation studios. It's going to be an actual thing and you guys are going to love it!\nEndless Journey is a new game mode that pushes Story War a little closer to Dungeons and Dragons than Apples to Apples - you'll be playing an allied team of Warriors (decked out with magic items, of course) fighting \"against the deck\" rather than each other!\nEndless Journey will be developed with the intention of having it be played as recurring sessions with continuity between them rather than just a once-off game, and we'll be releasing updates once a month that will affect your epic as it develops!\nWe made it! The final stretch goal, until we demolished it way ahead of time and had to come up with extras!\nSo it looks like now we'll be getting the ball rolling in developing a mobile adaptation of Story War! We're not exactly sure what form it'll take just yet, as it's a pretty big undertaking, but we'll keep you posted as we figure it out!\nWe've received a lot of messages about using Story War in schools, and kid-friendliness was an intentional goal of the project from really early on! Now that it's been successful beyond even our most ambitious guesses, we're going to pay some of that good fortune forward by giving away a hundred copies of Story War for use in classrooms!\nPlease spread the word and try to get your friends to back Story War and help us reach these stretch goals! We can't do it without your help!\nThe song in the video is \"Jetpack Blues, Sunset Hues\" by Anamanaguchi, used with permission. All the artwork was made by Vondell Swain.

The player is not the one trying to get to the end of the puzzle, but is instead trying to help a sleepwalker to the safety of his bed. The challenge is to use and manipulate the different objects, to steer the sleepwalker to safety.\nStory: Back to Bed\u2019s story is about Bob the sleepwalker and his subconscious guardian Subob. Bob suffers from narcolepsy and has an unlucky habit of sleepwalking in dangerous locations, such as rooftops. Luckily for Bob, his subconsciousness always tries to protect him in the form of Subob, a small creature springing from the mind of Bob. As Subob, the player\u2019s challenge is now, to protect Bob from the dangers of both the real world and his dreams.\nDADIU: Back to Bed was originally developed in a student production under the Danish Academy for Digital Interactive Entertainment (DADIU), in the fall of 2011. The members of the production team was made up of student from different universities, art schools, and the Danish Film School. The goal of the production was for student to experience being a part of a full production team, complete with roles and responsibilities. The result of the production is a game with a dozen level and a bunch of different mechanics for puzzles.\nThe original DADIU game can be found with the following link.\nhttp://backtobed.dadiugames.dk/\nThe current team consists of a mix between two small indie developers and extra people brought in on the production for their skill sets. The two companies are Bedtime Gaming and Rusty Dice Digital Games, both have core members from the original team, such as the original designers. The team members have all worked with different aspects of game production during their education and a large part of us have experience from other small indie games. We all have the common goal of creating a game that is not just fun, but also provide an artistic and a unique visual experience.\nHere is an interview with our Project Manager and Art Director, during the Nordic Game Indie Night\nIf you want to know more, Follow us on Facebook. \nThe reception for Back to Bed as a student project was beyond our expectations. The panel which reviewed the productions are all experienced members of the game industry and all agreed that we should finish and release the game. Over the next year we worked on and off on the game, fixing bugs and designing new elements. We were helped along by DADIU Greenhouse, a group helping students develop their games into finished products.Now we are in the last stretch of the production, all we are missing is the final funding and some hard work.\nOver the last year we have gotten some positive reviews, mentions and even won an award. All of these have helped us immensely, giving us a huge motivational factor and publicity. Worth mentioning is here some of the attention we got:\nIndependent Game Festival - Student Showcase\nGuts and Glory award\nRunner up for best student project - Unity Awards 2012\nFinalist at Nordic Indie Game Night.  \n6 out of 6 in Danish Newspaper - Politiken\nThe backing will go towards the final stretch of the production. We decided to gather together as many people as we can from both the original student team, and the two indie companies working together on the production. This means expenses for transport, lodging, and basic necessities.\nApart from the resources for finishing the game there is also the case of licenses for the software we use. The original game was done with student licenses, so at this point the production has to secure new ones to publish the game.\nSo what does this final production period add to the game? \nNew content: First of all we are redoing most of the old levels and adding new ones. Our goal is to end up with 30 different levels, adding in new mechanics as the player progresses through them. These levels will be split into two worlds, the first being the original, and the second being a whole new world with a maritime theme and dangers inspired by this.\niPad version: Along with a new world and many new levels we are working on making the game run smoothly on the iPad platform. The game lends itself very well to the casual feel of the tablet, and the best response to the game so far, have been the early iPad version. The painted and surreal look of the game give the feeling of playing in a painting with the handheld tablet.\nAfter the iPad release we will update the newest version of the game to a PC and Mac version, and release it, either on our own or through a digital distributor.\nwww.backtobed.dadiugames.dk", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe feel that the risks related to the production of Back to Bed are minor. They relate to the tweaking and release, since the core game is already done, and the concept is proven. However, as with all game productions there will always be some risks. \n\nOne of our big fears, was that the game wouldn\u2019t run smoothly on the iPad. However, it turns out that with a few optimisations, the game is able to run just as well as is does on the PC. The challenge now is to create a control scheme which feels intuitive on a tablet. We got some pretty good ideas to do just that!\n\nOne thing is to get a game on the App store, but the real challenge is to get noticed on the App store. With a limited PR budget we won\u2019t be doing any advertisement. Instead we hope that the uniqueness of our game and your support will keep it from drowning in the ocean of other games on the App store.\n\nThe last risk is that we cannot make any guarantees on when the PC/Mac version is ready for release. Most likely the version will be produced shortly after the iPad version is done, since only a few tweaks in controls and graphics are needed. Since many members of the production team have other projects and jobs to return to, we can\u2019t precisely schedule a completion date yet. In the end we consider this as a very low risk, since we love our game and the tweaking needed is limited.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #34", "update_userinfo": "Figment is now available on the App Store (from the creators of Back to Bed)", "update_content": "Hi Everyone\nWanted to update you all on the latest big thing happing to the Game Studio you Kickstarted once upon a time :) "}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #33", "update_userinfo": "Back to Bed launches on Nintendo Switch", "update_content": "Hi Everyone :)\n6 years ago you where kind enough to back a group of students, who've never released a video game before.

At the last count, (we're still counting), there were 700,000 Android games in the Android ecosystem. So far we have identified 200 titles that will be great to play on GameStick but we are working with our network of over 250 developers including great studios such as Madfinger, Hutch, Disney and others to bring you the best line-up. What's really cool is that the average cost of a game on GameStick will be just a few dollars and many will be free to play.\nAndrew Eades, CEO of console and mobile game developer Relentless  Software talks about why GameStick will appeal to Indie developers.\nBut that's not all..\nWe're about driving and supporting innovation and to prove that, we are making everything we build - our tools, services and developer community available to other manufacturers. We think this will really accelerate change - a good thing for player and the industry as a whole.\nJoin the revolution\nWe want to unite gamers around the world through the most basic of human instincts - the desire to play. We all love to play and this project is about bringing the widest group of gamers possible via an open ecosystem.\nIn the US alone, we spend 250 BILLION hours a year watching TV - that's 73 days per person. We suggest it's time to stop watching and start playing.\nStatus\nWe have been developing this project for a little over a year now. We have a working prototype of the GameStick as demonstrated below. It's not as pretty right now as it will be but it's ours and it's working. We're 90% of the way to getting the final pre-production sample in our hands. GameStick works with any Bluetooth controller supporting HID including, we are delighted to say, the Greenthrottle Games controller. Our own Bluetooth controller is in the final design stage designed and is with our engineering and our manufacturing team in China for PCB development. The last thing we are looking at is the final positioning of the GameStick transport slot, which we may move to the rear of the controller - we expect the pre-production samples to be ready in 5-6 weeks.\nOur production plan is as follows:\nWe need you!\nThis is a big project. We are very lucky to be able to use our existing back-end infrastructure and developer network to get this off the ground. The investments we have made over the past few years allows us to scale up and share our innovation with the wider industry. But.... like all big projects, we need support to bring this to market in a big way. It just can't happen without you.\nOur mission is to help change an industry that is as ripe for change now as the music industry was 10 years ago. We can only do that by being bold and focused on bringing you the best games at the best prices via great products. We would really appreciate your support.\nAbout us\nWe are PlayJam - an award-winning company that for the past 3 years has strived to bring games into the living room via Smart TV. In that time, we have built the largest games network on Smart TV which to date comprises of free to play games.

One thing we have learned along the way is that it is never simple. We think we've found a great route with GameStick and have been fortunate enough to be able to use a lot of the underlying technology we have already developed to help get this project off the ground.\n\nWe've worked with some great partners from leading chip manufacturers to R&D and hardware development houses in Asia to get to this point. We have faced some significant design challenges along the way, not least in terms of packing the technology within such a small form factor but also in terms overheating issues in earlier prototypes which we have now solved through our choice of processor.\n\nWe believe we are now 80% there but we need to put the latest prototype through 3rd party rigorous testing. We also need to convince the developer community that their games belong on TV. We have some great games lined up already from some of the most successful Android developers out there but there is still more work to be done. Our energy and focus thus far has been directed at getting to working prototype and planning for launch. Going forward, we will be calling on the more than 250 developers we already work with on TV to join those that have already committed to GameStick plus anyone else as excited as we are by this opportunity.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #47", "update_userinfo": "Update.", "update_content": "Hello Backers, \nFulfilment is now in full swing with most of the units having been delivered or with various mail / courier services.

When Malcolm discovers the pond, and the giant amphibian looming inside, he is made aware of his own connection to this world and becomes a part of it.\nMalcolm swimming in the pond with the Giant Salamander below\nMalcolm and the Giant Salamander\nMalcolm is an amateur naturalist who collects small animal specimens into jars and tanks. He keeps a little shack in the woods which serves as both his research laboratory and workshop. He is around nine years old. If I had to describe him in three words: Young David Attenborough\nor maybe: Doogie Howser, Biologist\nMalcolm's Specimens in Jars and Tanks\nMalcolm observes a tadpole.\nMalcolm's Shack\nI have always wanted to make a movie that featured a BIG monster, but a monster that could be real. So the idea of an enormous salamander crept into my brain after watching a Planet Earth special that featured larger salamanders. In real life they would never be as big as the amphibian in my short, but there's still some realism attached that whets my imagination. It's like the shark in Steven Spielberg's JAWS. Its wayyy to big, but that's what makes it exciting.\nThere's no dialogue in this short. The story calls for only one human character, so there's no one for him to speak out loud to. However, there's plenty of action, a good original soundtrack, and lots to look at and think about.\nThis project is something that I've had on the back burner for a couple years. It was in the last eight months that I've spent time structuring the story, making storyboards, and putting together a ten minute animatic. Starting about two months ago and continuing into the present, I've begun the actual animation production, which you can see some of in the video above.\nWith funding, I'll be able to get this thing done by spring. At that time, I'll email all the backers a link to download an HD .mov file of the final video. I'll be submitting the short to the handful big film festivals (the big actual, scary ones. Some of which are in foreign countries). I'll also try to get it in some smaller local screenings in the Bay Area and in New York. Then after that I'll be posting it on my vimeo account. I thought about making a DVD, but does anyone really want a DVD of a ten minute short?\nThere's some donation rewards on the right, I had a hard time describing what the rewards were going to be, they're gonna be fun and worth it.

Throughout my career, I've worked for many studios including Don Bluth, Electronic Arts, Cartoon Network, Pixar, Nickelodeon, Disney, and many more. In 2001, I left my position as Head of Special Effetcs at Warner Brothers Feature Animation, so that I could pursue being a full time independent artist. I had always done personal work after hours and on weekends, but with my departure from Hollywood, I was hoping that from then on, I could make my art the primary focus of my career. In 2002, I moved to the Pacific Northwest, and began working seriously toward that dream.\nSince leaving the studios and becoming a full time independent artist, I have done books, graphic novels, short films, a video game, live performances, etc, while at the same time, continuing my affiliation with the movie, television and game industries as a freelancer.\nAnd now, I feel ready to tackle my dream of making an independent animated feature film.\nTHE SAGA OF REX: THE MOVIE IN MY HEAD\nTHE SAGA OF REX is labor of love that reflects my deep love for science fiction, strange creatures, otherwordly concepts, and classical animation. When I created THE SAGA OF REX graphic novel, I literally saw it as a movie in my head and treated the whole thing as a fully art directed storyboard. I saw the characters, the effects and the landscapes move in my mind's eye, and tried to convey as much of that feeling as I could on the pages.\nA COSMIC LOVE STORY\nTHE SAGA OF REX is the story of a little fox who gets abducted by a flying saucer and is transported to the planet Edernia, where he encounters the Blossoms, a race of shape shifters.\nOne of the Blossoms, chooses Rex as a potential mate and so the adventure begins. Rex must prove his worth and Aven, the shapeshifting Blossom, must conquer Rex\u2019s heart.\nIt\u2019s a love story. It\u2019s an adventure. It\u2019s an epic journey into an alien world. I am convinced that it will make a fascinating and beautiful film.\nA 1\u00bd TO 4 MINUTE SHORT FILM AT FIRST\nSo, how do I go about making a film of THE SAGA OF REX? Here's my concept: My first goal, before diving into a feature length film is to make a short film. The short will be a self-contained section of the feature film and will be used for the second round of financing (which may or may not necessarily be on Kickstarter). Preferably, the short film will be 4 minutes in length, but shorter will work too (you will help determine the length, but more on that later). So why 4 minutes you ask? Here are my reasons:\nI believe THE SAGA OF REX will be beautiful, visionary, surreal, and fascinating, but I also realize that it will be quite artsy in terms of storytelling. If it is too long, it could be taxing on the audience. This is why I want to make the movie as short as possible, yet I still want it to qualify as a feature film. According to the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences:\n\"An animated feature film is defined as a motion picture with a running time of more than 40 minutes, in which movement and characters\u2019 performances are created using a frame-by-frame technique.\"\n40 minutes for a film like THE SAGA OF REX sounds just like what I have in mind\u2014so this is perfect! But in order to be eligible for Academy Award submission...\n\"No more then ten percent of the running time of a film, is allowed to be shown in a nontheatrical medium prior to the film\u2019s theatrical release.\"\nSince I want to have the option of submitting the film, and at the same time, I want to be able to share the footage created through Kickstarter with the world\u2014as soon as it is completed\u2014I need to make sure I play by the rules. Hence, the four minutes limit (40 minutes \u00f7 10 = 4 minutes).\nThe credits will be different in the short film and feature film so I'm not worried about going over 4 minutes with that part of it.\nYOU DETERMINE THE LENGTH OF THE FILM\nI evaluated that by working full time, at my regular pace of 50 hours a week, I can produce around one minute of completed film every 8 to 10 weeks. I also need to budget for sound and music since this is not my area of expertise. I already produced approximately 30 seconds of animation so the new footage will be added to that.\nFIRST GOAL - $15,000: I will create ONE minute of new full color animation bringing the total length to 1\u00bd minutes. LOCKED!\nSECOND GOAL - $30,000: I will create TWO minutes of new full color animation bringing the total length to 2\u00bd minutes. LOCKED!\nTHIRD GOAL - $45,000: I will create THREE minutes of new full color animation bringing the total length to 3\u00bd minutes. LOCKED!\nFOURTH GOAL - $52,500:  I will create THREE AND A HALF minutes of new full color animation bringing the total length to 4 minutes. LOCKED!\nFIFTH GOAL - $60,000: In addition to the FOUR-MINUTE SHORT FILM, I will create a TWO-MINUTE THEATRICAL TRAILER featuring 30 seconds of new animation.\nIf we reach the $60,000 mark, I will create a 2-minute theatrical trailer featuring scenes from the short film as well as 30 seconds of new animation. For the new animation, I will cherry pick events from the graphic novel that will display the full breath of what the feature film will look like: spectacular, emotional, poetic, action-packed, mysterious and thrilling.\nAdding 30 more seconds of animation that will be publicly shown before the completed feature film's theatrical release means that I will have to increase the length of the feature film to 45 minutes, so that I still respect the Academy's 10% rule. This is okay\u2014a 45-minute film still falls within the range of what I envision.\nAnything raised above the fifth goal will go back into the production to pay for sound and music, more lavish animation and effects, etc. EVERYTHING WILL GO INTO THE FILM. The bigger the budget, the more impressive this film will be. If you make the calculation (subtract rewards and 10% Kickstarter and Amazon fee), you will see how low the budget actually is for what I'm trying to attempt. That's why any surplus in money would allow me to expand the project further (equipment, software, assistant animator, etc). I'm not here to get rich, I only want an opportunity to do a beautiful film.\nOnce the short film is completed, I will start designing the next phase of financing, as well as planning the potential addition of a small crew. But first, let's do this first part!\nEVOLVING TECHNOLOGY\nWhen I started in the animation industry back in the 80s, I dreamt of a day when the technology would evolve to a point where a small group of artists, or even a single one, would be able to create complex and fully animated films\u2014something that could only be achieved with huge crews and big budgets at the time. Throughout my career, I kept learning everything I could about animation filmmaking while exploring new technologies. I always kept my dream alive of one day making that \"classically animated\" movie that would look like a big budget feature film, only done with a fraction of the cost. The big appeal for me was simple\u2014if the cost was massively reduced, a truly singular artistic vision could be kept untampered.\nWhen digital ink & paint and compositing started making their way into the animation biz in the early 90s, I hooked up with Cambridge Animation from the UK, to help them develop Animo, a 2D software for traditional animators. From that relationship, I made a short film called, PRELUDE TO EDEN, and became one of the spokepersons for Animo (watch the film here).\nDuring that period, Animo became the prime tool for non-Disney animated feature films, being used on movies such as, THE IRON GIANT, OSMOSIS JONES, PRINCE OF EGYPT, THE QUEST FOR CAMELOT, ELDORADO, SPACE JAM and many more. However, 2D animation software from other sources continued to evolve while Animo stagnated. I had to come to the realization that Animo, a product of a now defunct company which hadn't been updated since 2006, was no longer cutting edge. After over 15 years of using Animo for my animation projects, it was time for me to move on. I did some research and found a series of software called Toon Boom. Quickly thereafter, I proceeded to use Toon Boom Harmony 10, their latest offering, to create an animation test based on my graphic novel, THE SAGA OF REX (you can read all about it here).\nToon Boom allowed me to remain 100% paperless and bypass time-consuming steps such as scanning and processing drawings. By working directly within the software with a Cintiq tablet, my process was massively sped up. To test this, I gave myelf a 3-week deadline in an effort to see how much I could accomplish within that time frame. Chosing a simple section of the graphic novel, I was able to singlehandedly create approximately 30 seconds of animation, fully colored and composited. This would have been unthinkable if I would have been hand drawing the animation on paper. Granted, I worked like a mad man for the duration of the test, and this was one of the simplest section of the graphic novel with only one character and very little special effects\u2014most of the book is a good deal more involved and would require more time\u2014but nevertheless, I saw what was possible.\nTHE ORIGIN OF REX\nIn 1997, I was working at Warner Brothers Feature Animation as Special Effects Supervisor. My production assistant at the time, Scott Grieder, really enjoyed my art and suggested that I do a children's book. The thought of illustrating a storybook sounded pretty cool, so I told Scott, \"I'll draw it and you write it.\" I quickly scribbled a drawing of a cute little fox facing a strange creature and gave it to Scott. \"This is your starting point, write something about that,\" I said to him.\nTwo weeks later, before Scott had a chance to begin writing, I had completed twenty more illustrations.\"Here's more inspiration for your story,\" I said while handing him a stack of photocopies.\nAnother fifteen to twenty days later, I called Scott to tell him that the book was finished and that I'd written the whole thing. I couldn't stop myself\u2014it just poured out of me. I was glad to hear that Scott was relieved to have the burden off his shoulders.\nA SEARCH FOR MEANING: THE STORY OF REX was finished in December 1997 and published in July 1998 as an oversized hardcover book, signed and numbered edition of 1000\nI sold the book at trade shows, conventions and to friends, and after a couple of years, sold out all the copies. I didn't want to let the story disappear into oblivion, so in 2002, I colored the illustrations, refined the layouts, and self-published the second hard cover edition. I actually managed to get a distribution deal for the new edition and was able to get the book in several comic shops and bookstores.\nThe color edition eventually sold out and in my desire to keep the story available for readers, I included the original black and white version of the book in PARABLES: AN ANTHOLOGY, a compilation of the first four storybooks I self-published in 2004.\nREX TAKES FLIGHT\nBack in 2004, I was doing a signing at the Golden Apple Comics Booth at the Long Beach Wizard Con. Kazu Kibuishi (Amulet, Daisy Kutter) came to my table and showed me a binder containing the artwork for a comic anthology he was putting together called, FLIGHT. I was very impressed with it. Kazu was familiar with my work and hoped I'd be a part of future volumes, so when I suggested using my REX character, he was very receptive. One of Kazu's goals with Flight was to help artists build their own graphic novels in manageable chunks. Not sure if anyone else took advantage of that, but I, for one, saw a golden opportunity.\nWhen I did the first 17 pages for FLIGHT vol. 2, I had no idea where the overall story would take me. By the time FLIGHT vol. 3 rolled in, I had figured out the overall outline with its main themes and concepts. Within that framework, I kept improvising and coming up with new ideas as I went along.  From 2005 to 2010, I did a new chapter every year and progressively built the story over six volumes of FLIGHT.\nTHE SAGA OF REX was very loosely thumbnailed, and in some cases I didn't even thumbnail at all. I'd go straight ahead with cleaned up and colored pages without knowing exactly what the next page would be like. This method of working would be impossible in mainstream comics, but for a project like REX, being serialized in FLIGHT, it worked well. I found that it kept me constantly on my toes creatively and allowed new ideas to sneak in and surprise me. It made the whole process fun, unexpected and never boring.\nOnce the story was completed, I repackaged the whole thing, added a few pages and sent a mock-up to Image Comics, to see if they would be interested in publishing the graphic novel. I was delighted to get a very enthusiastic response from Image Comics' publisher, Eric Stephenson, and the book was quickly added to their pipeline. The complete SAGA OF REX was published by Image Comics in the fall of 2010.\nREWARDS\nThe rewards will allow you to dig deeper into my universe of strange beings, otherwordly concepts and offbeat storytelling.

Aria's world may not be our own but the issues she faces are. Help spread her story.\nIn 1946, the producers of The Adventures of Superman radio program, along with the help of activist Stetson Kennedy, infiltrated the KKK  and created fictional stories based on the reality of KKK as villains. They publicly aired real clan rituals and codewords, allowing local law enforcement to further infiltrate the KKK, and villainizing the racist terror organization for generations to come. Pop-culture can make a difference. \nHome of the Brave begins with the story of Aria Monfort, a 13 year old girl who works 14 hour days, and just learned to read a year ago.  She's also the youngest person in her country to be accepted into a prestigious university, learns trigonometry during her lunch breaks, and may cure some of the world's deadliest diseases.

What began as a literary movement with H.G. Wells and Jules Verne quickly spread to music, fashion, and film.\nThe Film\nWith this 20-minute documentary, we desire to capture some of the unique stories of individuals who have adopted steampunk as a lifestyle. We will shoot 5 consecutive weekends starting October 20th, 2012. Editing will be done in November and December, and the official premiere will occur in April 2013, with nationwide festival submissions to follow.\nYour donation at work\nThe $1200 we hope to raise will purchase a 2TB G-Tech hard drive, Canon lens rentals for 5 weekends, CF cards, location permits, hiring a composer, food, gas, expendables, promotional expenses, festival submissions, and duplicating and mailing DVDs.\nTravel is a huge portion of our budget.  Our ultimate dream is to be able to fly up to Seattle in October for SteamCon.  We also definitely want to make it out to Vegas for the Vegas Valley Book Festival's Steampunk Ball in November.  Since gas prices just hiked up 40 cents overnight in California, gas money to get to events, conventions, and interviews will be essential.\nThe Story\nWhile we will get into some of the history of steampunk, the goal is to understand how steampunk works as a tranforming influence in the lives of modern individuals.  For instance, a group of steampunk anarchists in England have adopted steampunk in order to teach themselves how to understand technology on a basic enough level that, if World War III were to occur, they could survive on the technological flotsam and jetsam of an imploded global society.  Others are attracted to it because it bridges the gap between generations -- bringing together grandmothers and granddaughters to talk fashion, keeping alive family histories and legacies, and reawakening an interest in the past.  \nThere is also conflict among different factions of the steampunk community over what steampunk is and where the future of steampunk lies.  We want to explore as many of these viewpoints as possible to understand the passion of the subculture as a whole, and the devotion that people on all sides of the issue have for steampunk.\nPlease consider your financial support and come along with us as we attempt to understand steampunk's potential impact on modern society.

Here, John Sr. remembers his sons and reflects on coping with his tremendous loss.\nMiss Devine  |Cousins James Ransom and Cherie Johnson recall their fearsome Sunday school teacher, Miss Lizzie Devine, the only woman who had more power than their grandmother. Set in the small Florida town of the cousins' memories, this animation resounds with the joy of sharing stories with family.\nNo More Questions!  | Kay Wang was a strong-willed grandmother who was reluctantly taken to a StoryCorps booth by her son and granddaughter. Though Kay resisted, she still had stories to tell\u2014from disobeying her mother and rebuffing suitors while growing up in China to late-life adventures as a detective for Bloomingdale\u2019s department store. Kay passed away just weeks after that interview, and her son and granddaughter returned to StoryCorps to remember her gentler side, which she kept to herself.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #6", "update_userinfo": "THANK YOU!", "update_content": "Our first full-length animation special will air in 2013 and it's thanks to YOU!

I'm in the process of working on the final chapter which will complete the full 300 page story.\nWhat is reMIND?\nreMIND is an all ages sci-fi about faith, underwater lizard-men and brain transplantation. I was inspired by comic artists in the 90's when I refined my drawing style and then was influenced by Miyazaki's movies and storytelling over the last decade.\nFeel free to read through as many pages as you want on my website here. I post new pages every Monday online and will continue to post pages until they are all live towards the end of 2013. \nThe first printing of volume 1 was printed in spring of 2011 and is currently sold out but you can see some customer reviews of it on Amazon here.\nreMIND has already won a few awards which include:\n2010 Xeric Grant Winner\n2012 Great Graphic Novels for Teens List (GGNT)\nBook Specs.\nreMIND Volume 1 (second printing) is 152 full color pages and hardcover that includes Chapters 1 - 3 of reMIND. The interiors will be exactly the same as the first printing. The cover will have an alternate coloring job so it will look different than the first printing but with the exact same cloth binding. The retail price is $24.95.\nreMIND Volume 2 (first printing) will be 176 full color pages and hardbound with a cloth binding. Vol 2 concludes the story of reMIND containing Chapters 4 - 7. All limited Kickstarter copies will be signed and numbered. The retail price will probably be $29.95.\nWhat is Phobos?\nPlease see update #5 for a detailed description of Phobos.\nPublication Date\nreMIND Volume 2 and the reprinting of Volume 1 is scheduled to go to the printer in October if everything goes according to plan. The printing process will take about 3 months for the proofs, printing and shipping to happen. This means I'll probably be getting the books around January or maybe February if the holidays get in the way (which I assume they will)\nI put April as the shipping date as an absolute worst case scenario if I can't get the printing started when planned. But I am estimating that the books will be in my garage by January so I can start shipping them out soon after.\nWhy Self-Publish?\nPeople ask me why I chose to self-publish remind. Well, when I started this my dream was to get the best agent and publisher and take the world by storm with my graphic novels. What I learned is that nobody cares about what you want to do until after you prove yourself. So I started posting my pages online in 2009 to try to grow an audience and sure enough a small group started following my progress. Later I applied for the self publisher's Xeric grant in 2010 and won $5000. This convinced me to fully commit to self-publish and it was then that I launched my first kickstarter back in 2010. To my surprise I raised over 12 thousand additional dollars to help print the first volume. Now I HAD to self-publish as well as learn to distribute and sell my books. My original kickstarter campaign has been essential in getting reMIND where it is now and it has opened up doors that I never thought possible.\n\nThe funny thing is now that I have a beautiful book published I am approached by big publishers regularly as well as distributors. I could easily sign a contract with a good publisher but in being forced to self publish, I have also fallen in love with it. I can make the books exactly how I want them to look and reprint them whenever I want. I can focus on what's important to me instead of a publisher who is mainly focused on the bottom line. It's a ton of work and I still have a lot to learn about things like distribution and marketing but overall I love self-publishing as well as owning all the rights to my stories.\n\nMy business plan is to get to the point where I can make a living off of my self-publishing by always printing high quality first printing books that are numbered, rare and sending them directly to my customers. The second and third printings will be manufactured more with mass distribution in mind once I figure that part out a little better.\n\nI hope the quality of my books are apparent as soon as you see it on the shelf and even more so when you slowly flip through the pages. My goal has always been to make a coffee table book that also happens to be a comic.\nMoney\nNow lets talk about where the money will go. Since the first Volume of reMIND is out-of-print, I need to reprint it at the same time that I print the new Volume 2. The first Volume cost me a little over $11,000 to print 2500 copies. On top of reprinting Volume 1, I will need to raise an additional $13,000 to print Volume 2 which costs more because it has more pages. I want to print both books with a nice cloth binding again exactly like the first printing of Volume 1. So to add it all up, I need a bare minimum of $24,000 to print both books and I think it's attainable now that Kickstarter has gained popularity.  \nI have about $5000 saved but that will all end up going to kickstarter fees, taxes and shipping. Actually, $5000 won't even cover it all but I'm hoping to raise enough to take care of the extra unseen bills.\nRemember that Kickstarter is an All-or-Nothing system. If I can't raise the full amount in the time given then I won't get anything. :(\nIf this campaign goes over it's funding goal, I already have lots of ideas for additional rewards for everyone who backs it so please help me spread the word if possible.\nPledge Options\n____________________________________________________________\n____________________________________________________________\n____________________________________________________________\n____________________________________________________________\n____________________________________________________________\n____________________________________________________________\n____________________________________________________________\n____________________________________________________________\n____________________________________________________________\n____________________________________________________________\n____________________________________________________________\n____________________________________________________________\n____________________________________________________________\nBe sure to check back because I plan on adding new rewards regularly!\nInternational Shipping Chart\nPlease add the additional shipping if your books will be sent outside of North America.

I\u2019m John Kricfalusi (creator of Ren and Stimpy). I have a new cartoon I need your help in producing. It stars one of the original Ren and Stimpy characters, Mr. George Liquor, AMERICAN! You loved him in Dog Show and Man's Best Friend. Now bring him to life in CANS WITHOUT LABELS!\nGeorge is an old school, manly, Republican sort of guy. He thinks today\u2019s Republicans are wimps. He\u2019s leathery on the outside but all mush in the center, at least with his dear ones. He believes in \u201ctough love\u201d and lives his life according to the rules. \u201cIt\u2019s Discipline that begets love!\u201d\nHOW DID I COME UP WITH THIS PREPOSTEROUS STORY?\nIT REALLY HAPPENED - THAT'S HOW! George is largely inspired by my own manly Dad.\nDad believes in the old values: hard work, rules and most important of all \u2013 SAVING A BUCK! Wasting money is a sin against Almighty Bejeezus. Hang on to every last penny and put it away for a rainy day, or face the consequences!\nLike my Dad, George craves a bargain. He'll not pay sticker price for anything. He ONLY buys stuff on sale and refuses to buy any brand name products.\nBrand Names are a Commie Scam!\nDad didn't allow us to drink Coca Cola on principle - maybe because it tasted too good for the price. \"Tasting good is an advertising gimmick!\" Instead he would buy generic supermarket brands like \u201cLoblaws - cola\u2013like drinkable substance\u201d which tasted like motor oil and had no fizz: \u201cYou know what fizz goes for these days?!\u201d  \nWe had \u201cCatsup\u201d instead of Heinz\u2019 Ketchup. He\u2019d buy a 6 year\u2019s supply of red paste in huge crusty bottles for a 10th of what the regular sized brand name cost.\nOf course we couldn\u2019t have KLEENEX so we blew our noses in our poodle\u2019s clipped torso fur. NOTHING was wasted at the Kricfalusi home \u2013 at least not while Dad was watching. \nNo Labels at all\nAs much as Dad loves his generic brand labels, there are products he loves even better \u2013 products with no label at all!\nOur local supermarket \u2013 LOBLAWS again, used to sell damaged can goods on the bottom shelf at the back of the store. They would tear the labels off the cans and discount them. Then they\u2019d take a marker and write 5 or 10 cents on them. These super cheap mystery cans brought Dad to the heights of ecstasy.\nHe'd grab a cart and mow down all the old ladies who were trying to get at the cans and he\u2019d snatch up every can on the shelf. He loved these cans without labels so much he built his own wooden shelves in the basement to honor his collection of tin treasures.\nHe nailed two-by-fours right into the concrete with his fists. \u201cDo you know how much HAMMERS go for these days?!\u201d  My whole family was terrified by the shelf of naked cans. Mom refused to eat any of them. She was the only one in the family who was allowed to have brand name products.\nWe always knew when Dad was going to feed us one of these mystery cans cause we\u2019d hear him downstairs sliding the cans around the rough wood and concrete and chuckling to himself.\nAs he stomped upstairs with an armload of cans, we\u2019d try to escape, but he\u2019d locked all the doors and windows. Trapped!\nHe'd dump the cans onto the kitchen table, call everyone in for lunch and we\u2019d drag ourselves to our fate.\nHe always swore there would be something really tasty in a can and thought he could deduce what was it was using the scientific method. He\u2019d count the rings and look at whether the lid was silver or gold and then conclude...\n\u201cI think there are some nice peaches in this can!\u201d .\nLet me tell you something\u2026  There were NEVER any Goddamn peaches in these things. It was always something gruesome \u2013 like a whole plucked chicken carcass with staples in its ear holes; its limp stubbly skin hanging off mummified crumbling bones.\nOne time he opened up a can of pickled kittens.\nIt didn\u2019t matter if he guessed wrong about the contents of a can because he believed in not wasting anything the Lord has blessed us with.\n\u201cHERE\u2019S THE RULE \u2013 ONCE WE OPEN THE CAN \u2013 WE HAVE TO EAT WHATEVER\u2019S IN IT!\u201d\nWe\u2019d scream and try to crawl out the windows but he\u2019d wrestle us to the ground and force us to eat the pickled pets. We couldn\u2019t waste food at our house, because otherwise\u2026 \u201cDO YOU KNOW HOW MANY STARVING BIAFRAN KIDS WOULD KILL FOR A NICE PIECE OF KITTEN LIKE THIS?\u201d\nAnd thus...\nIn this cartoon, George introduces his innocent little nephews Slab N Ernie to his collection of Cans Without Labels.\nThere will be a special appearance of Spumco favorite CIGARETTES THE CAT and also a cameo from another beloved cartoon character.\nTHE CREATIVE TEAM\nGeorge Liquor is voiced by the great Mike Pataki, who, sadly, passed away last year. This is one of his last recordings for me.\nThe storyboard and layouts were drawn by hand by me and fellow Spumco Bigshot Jim Smith. \nEddie Fitzgerald of \u201cUncle Eddie\u201d fame is the voice of Cigarettes the Cat.\nEric Bauza is Slab. Gabe Swarr is Ernie.\nI am also employing my latest young talents who helped me with the Bobby Bigloaf cartoon, The Simpsons Couch Gag and Cartoon Network IDs: John Kedzie and Sarah Harkey\nIf you help me make the cartoon I will train some new cartoonists and animators as well and the world of animation will be that much richer.\n    EDIT: For international shipping refer to the following:\nFor the $30 and $50 pledges please add $5\nFor the $300 and $500 pledges please add $10\nFor the $1,000 pledge please add $15\nFor the $100 and $3,000 pledges please add $20\n\nEDIT: There is now a $1 reward so ALL of you fine folks will get a digital copy of the cartoon!\n    Be the first in your neighborhood to own one of my new digital toys.

We will paint the backgrounds and build a cg set and some props. Then we need to pay for music, sound effects and final editing.  The whole process will take about 7 months.  It will be 8-10 minutes long, which is about the same length as a Ren and Stimpy episode, but for HALF the price!\nWe will also make DVDs and produce the prizes to ship out to all you swell folks who backed the project! \nThis is your chance to be your own Hollywood Cartoon executive and produce a Spumco-type cartoon the way you like it!\nThanks in advance for bringing the future of cartoon-making into the world of now!\nYour best friend,\nJohn Kricfalusi\nP.S.\nDon't for get to check this out!\nmusic courtesy of www.apmmusic.com\nHere's me showing how we ink our cartoons using Toonboom's \"Animate\" program.

Also, you'll want to read this as well. I know it's lengthy but there's a lot of information you'll want to have for the weeks and months ahead.\nBacker Reward Levels: This project has grown astoundingly in the last few weeks. Stretch goals have taken us way past what we initially offered for rewards. But Kickstarter doesn't allow us to edit the rewards listed on the right hand side. So, instead of looking there to see what each level gets, scroll down to see a complete list of rewards for each level and the shipping costs for each for those outside North America.\nModify Your Reward: You can tailor your reward by using the \"Manage My Pledge\" feature. Look toward the bottom of the page for a list of Reward Add-On items you can add onto your existing reward. Just add the appropriate amount to your pledge. When the Kickstarter campaign is over, you'll be asked which add-ons you want.\nQuestions? Please check out the FAQ at the bottom of the page before contacting me directly. Also, asking a question in the comments allows other backers to chime in with answers to questions that have been answered many times before.\nPayPal: If you would rather pay for a backer level via PayPal, click here.\nSTRETCH GOALS\nWe have reached 30 different stretch goals in this project. To take a look at the list of rewards we have already achieved (it's worth it), click here and scroll down a bit. \nLatest Stretch Goal Reached: $450,000. If we reach that point, we'll add significantly more art to the corebook and the hardcover books in the line. Like, say, at least 15-20% more than we were planning (and these were already art heavy books). This is going to make these books downright lavish, in my opinion. REACHED!\nNext Stretch Goal: At $500,000,I'll produce a Numenera short film. This might be animated, or it might be live action. I honestly never thought this would even be in the realms of possibility. If it happens, it will certainly be a way to reach a lot more people about the game in the future.\nT-Shirts: These are now available to backers! Check out the Reward Add-Ons.\nMen's Back\nMen's Front\nI'm really excited to announce that I'm working on a new game called Numenera. It's a far future, science fantasy, post-apocalyptic game with streamlined rules that prioritize the story, the action, and the wild ideas. If you're a fan of outside-of-the-box gameplay such as that found in Planescape, Dark Space, or Chaositech, the far-future stories of Gene Wolfe, Michael Moorcock, or Jack Vance, or mind-blowing visuals like those found in the work of French artist Moebius, you're going to love Numenera.\nNumenera is set a billion years in the future. Civilizations have risen and fallen on Earth. Even though the current inhabitants live at about a Medieval level of technology, the leftover remnants of these advanced societies lie all around them. Some of these are extremely helpful: advanced tools, valuable means of communication and learning, transportation, defenses, and weapons. Others are dangerous: genetically altered monstrosities, flesh-warping radiation, creatures transplanted from distant stars, and clouds of out-of-control nanobots, just to name a few. This setting, called the Ninth World, provides all manner of opportunities and challenges to those that call it home.\nThe game system that drives Numenera is meant to be fast-moving and simple, so that it facilitates the stories the group wants to create, the imaginative places and creatures the GM needs to describe, and the mind-blowing ideas the world encourages. Everything in the game is designed with these goals in mind. \nI've assembled a great team to work with me. Artist extraordinaire Kieran Yanner is the lead artist. He and I are working together to create a unique visual look for the setting. The excellent Shanna Germain is the lead editor, and she and I are working on some amazing concepts both for the game and the presentation of the material. I've got the developers at 3 lb Games designing an app that will make it easier and more fun to play with your smartphone, tablet, or PC. But I'd love to see you join the team too, either as a backer, or even a contributor (see the backer levels for more information).\nFor more information, go to Numenera.com. There is a lot of information there about the game, and much more is coming! And keep checking back for frequent updates and more previews!\nThere are many backer reward levels, each offering different things. Below you will find a detailed list which is much more accurate and complete than what is listed on the right hand side of the page (which we cannot edit at this stage). For more information about these individual rewards, click here.\nPlease let me draw your attention to THE REAL DEAL, however. This is the main package and an incredible value. For $60, you get the printed hardcover corebook, the PDF of the same book, a PDF of the Player's Guide, and PDFs of three 32-page adventures, the Ninth World Bestiary, Sir Arthur's Compendium, the GM's screen, and more.\nALL LEVELS\nContribute a quote\n6 HD Wallpapers\nNumenera Theme digital download\nDABBLER $3 Level\nApp (Android, iOS, or PC)\nSUPPORTER $5 Level\nApp (Android, iOS, or

BusinessWeek! The Verge! Wired! IGN! The New York Times! Time!\nWe love console games.\nThere's something about a big HD TV and digital surround sound that fills up a living room. Shooters, platformers, sports games, arcade classics and experimental indie games just feel bigger on a TV screen. It's how most of us grew up gaming. \nBut maybe people are missing out.\nWe get it \u2013 smartphones and tablets are getting all the new titles \u2013 they're \"what's hot.\u201d The console market is pushing developers away. We\u2019ve seen a brain drain: some of the best, most creative gamemakers are focused on mobile and social games because those platforms are more developer-friendly. And the ones who remain focused on console games can\u2019t be as creative as they\u2019d like.\nDeep down, you know your best gaming memories happened in the living room.\nYou busted your ass just to find out the princess was \"in another castle.\" You fought bosses that told you repeatedly how much \"you suck.\" You taped a blanket to half of your screen so your friend couldn't see where you were. You traded the best players onto your team just so you could have the perfect season. And you did it all on the TV.\nIt's time to upend console gaming.\nLet\u2019s open this sucker up! It's time we brought back innovation, experimentation, and creativity to the big screen. Let\u2019s make the games less expensive to make, and less expensive to buy. With all our technological advancements, shouldn't costs be going down? Gaming could be cheaper!\nWe're handing the reins over to the developer with only one condition: at least some gameplay has to be free. We borrowed the free-to-play model from games like League of Legends, Team Fortress 2, Triple Town, and many others. Developers can offer a free demo with a full-game upgrade, in-game items or powers, or ask you to subscribe.\nOUYA: The revolution will be televised \nOUYA is a new game console for the TV, powered by Android.\nWe've packed this little box full of power. Developers will have access to OUYA's open design so they can produce their games for the living room, taking advantage of everything the TV has to offer. \nBest of all, OUYA's world-class controller, console, and interface come in one beautiful, inexpensive package. All the games on it will be free, at least to try.\nGreat games come from great developers.\nDevelopers can wave farewell to the roadblocks of bringing a console game to market. Anyone can make a game: every OUYA console is a dev kit. No need to purchase a license or an expensive SDK. It's built on Android, so developers already know how it works. \nThat doesn't mean OUYA is an Android port. You can create the next big title in your bedroom \u2013 just like the good old days! Who needs pants!? \nOUYA could change AAA game development, too. Forget about licensing fees, retail fees, and publishing fees. \nAnd developers agree:\n\"This has the potential to be the game developer\u2019s console. It's about time!\" -- Brian Fargo (founder of inXile) \n\u201cWho wouldn't want a beautiful piece of industrial design that sells for $99, plugs straight into your TV, and gives you access to a huge library of games?\" \u2013 Jordan Mechner (creator of Prince of Persia, Karateka) \n\u201cIf OUYA delivers on the promise of being the first true open gaming platform that gives indie developers access to the living room gaming market, yes that is a great idea. We will follow the development of OUYA and see how it resonates with gamers. I could see all current Mojang games go on the platform if there's a demand for it.\u201d \u2013 Mojang (developer of Minecraft) \n\"I'm excited for OUYA! I am a firm believer that there is always room to challenge the status quo.\" -- Jenova Chen (thatgamecompany, creator of flOw, Cloud, and Flower)\n\u201cThe prospect of an affordable, open console -- that's an idea I find really exciting.\u201d -- Adam Saltsman (Semi Secret, creator of Canabalt)\n\n\"Our games will work so well on a TV, we just need an easy way to get them there. OUYA could be it.\" -- Marek Rabas (Madfinger Games)\n\n\"An open game console that gives independent game developers the flexibility to experiment with their games and business models on the TV, is something that's long overdue.\" \u2013 David Edery (Spry Fox, creator of Triple Town)\nDesign matters.\nWe believe a great console requires a great user experience. We are working with the award-winning designer, Yves Behar, and his firm fuseproject (designer of the Jambox).\nWe are designing the controller to be a love letter to console gaming. It will have everything you've learned to love: fast buttons, triggers, laser-precise analog sticks, a D-Pad \u2013 and it will have a touchpad for any games making the trek from mobile or tablet to the TV. It'll be just the right weight. We are working with select developers to play-test the controller through development.  We call it 'the Stradivarius of controllers,' and we hope developers will be inspired to take gameplay to a new level with it.\nHackers welcome.\nHave at it: It's easy to root (and rooting won't void your warranty). Everything opens with standard screws. Hardware hackers can create their own peripherals, and connect via USB or Bluetooth. You want our hardware design? Let us know. We might just give it to you. Surprise us!\nSpecifications:\nTegra3 quad-core processor \n1GB RAM \n8GB of internal flash storage\nHDMI connection to the TV, with support for up to 1080p HD \nWiFi 802.11 b/g/n \nBluetooth LE 4.0 \nUSB 2.0 (one) \nWireless controller with standard controls (two analog sticks, d-pad, eight action buttons, a system button), a touchpad \nAndroid 4.0\nETHERNET! (Announced by Muffi 7/18)\nStandard OUYA Console\nLimited-Edition Kickstarter Console\nIt's entertainment beyond gaming. \nBecause OUYA is based on Android, any app developer could publish their Android app to OUYA. The possibilities are limitless, and conversations with potential partners are already underway. Here\u2019s our first: do you like watching StarCraft, or League of Legends? Watch Twitch.TV on your OUYA. \nWe've come a long way already. The user interface and industrial designs are far along. Our prototype is up and running. What we have left to do is simple, but it's expensive. (We\u2019re looking at you Mark Cuban! Woz! Help us out.)\nAll we need is you. \nWith your help, we need to: \nConvert our prototype to production-ready models and get all the regulatory approvals (yeah, we need these to sell them)\nDeliver developer kits (for early developers so we can have games on day one, though every console will include an SDK once we launch)\nPlace our first production orders (we are working with a manufacturing firm with lots of game hardware experience, but we need to know how many to make!)\nIdeally, fund some initial game development (i.e., 1st-party games)\nAnd if you\u2019re international, we want your help too\u2026gaming is global, and we will get you OUYA. We still have a lot to figure out in regards to rights and countries, but it can be done. Look what we've accomplished already! \nShow the world, through your numbers, that you're out there.\nShow them you're ready to level the playing field. Enlist others.

On my last two solo records, I worked with some great musicians and friends to create records in fairly traditional ways: overdubbed material, drum kits, too many guitars, and lots of vocals!  \nUpon arriving back home in California in 2010, I was inspired to try something new.  It has always been a goal to become more comfortable with musical notation and explore the possibilities of orchestral instruments.  Having been intrigued by composers like Charles Ives, Van Dyke Parks, and junior high school wind ensembles, my interest in translating musical ideas to instruments that require breath has only grown stronger. \nI was afforded the opportunity to compose new material at the MFA program in Integrated Composition and Improvisation at University of California Irvine and came up with a compelling set of songs.  I was able to meet with Van Dyke Parks, take a look at his scores, and chat with him about his approach to arranging.\nThe idea along the way has been to re-voice my musical ideas by getting rid of familiar sounds such as the bass guitar, drum kit, piano and acoustic guitar and replace them with things like the bass clarinet, timapni, cheap little synth, and trombone.  Another important component is to track everything live with no overdubs.  \nThe results have been super fresh!  It is my goal to get this music recorded by some *shredding* musicians in order to bring the music to the highest level possible.  Some of these musicians include Frank Lenz (Richard Swift), James McAlister (Sufjan Stevens), Mark Visher (Aimee Mann), and others.\nHere is where you, the faithful music lover, come in!  I am looking to make this project a recorded reality.  This will take paying the shredders what they deserve, mixing and mastering the record, pressing it on vinyl, and paying for artwork to be completed.  Speaking of artwork, this will be done by Dustin Ortiz. The exciting thing about all of this is that much of the heavy-lifting has already been done!  The notes are written, the concept of cover art is done, and the players have signed on...its just a matter of finishing it all up!\nI'm proud of the music and orchestrations I've come up with through this project and can confidently say that its some of the best music I've ever written.  I hope you consider supporting the project and being an integral part of the creative process. \nThe Breakdown:\n$2000 for musicians: 2 percussionists: $200 a piece (because they're friends!), 4 wind players ($400 a piece, because they're acquaintances!).\n$2000 for production of 500 vinyl copies: $1000 for full color sleeves from VGKids, $1000 for vinyl records from Record Technology Inc. (includes tax and shipping)\n$750 for mixing and mastering: this will be done by a very talented friend.\n$250 for artwork: poster and album design by Dustin Ortiz\nThanks.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #9", "update_userinfo": "update and first song", "update_content": "Here is a lil' video covering a bit more about the special $300 option that includes my first keyboard.

My career as an author of science and historical fiction has turned me into a swordsmanship geek. As such, I'm dissatisfied with how swordfighting is portrayed in existing video games. These could be so much more fun than they are. Time for a revolution.\nIn the last couple of years, affordable new gear has come on the market that makes it possible to move, and control a swordfighter's actions, in a much more intuitive way than pulling a plastic trigger or pounding a key on a keyboard. So it's time to step back, dump the tired conventions that have grown up around trigger-based sword games, and build something that will enable players to inhabit the mind, body, and world of a real swordfighter.\nCLANG will begin with the Queen of Weapons: the two-handed longsword used in Europe during late medieval and early renaissance times. This is a well-documented style that has enjoyed a revival in recent years thanks to the efforts of scholars and martial artists worldwide.\nAt first, it'll be a PC arena game based on one-on-one multiplayer dueling (which is a relatively simple and attainable goal; we don't want to mess this up by overreaching). Dueling, however, is only the tip of the sword blade. During the past few years, we have been developing a rich world, brimming with all manner of adventure tales waiting to be written--and to be played. In conjunction with 47 North, Amazon.com's new science fiction publishing house, we've already begun publishing some of those stories, and we have plenty more in the hopper. Once we get CLANG off the ground we intend to weave game and story content together in a way that'll enhance both the playing and the reading experience.\n\"How will this be different than SoulCalibur?\" you ask. .....\nLow-latency, high-precision motion controller: Critical to a satisfying sword fight is fast, accurate response. This is especially important for CLANG given the depth and complexity of moves that are used in real sword arts. Initially, CLANG will make use of a commercial, third-party, off-the-shelf controller that anyone can buy today\nDepth: Roundhouse swings and crude blocks just aren't enough. Real sword fighting involves multiple attacks delivered from different stances, pommel strikes, grappling, feints, and parries.\nExpandability: Implementing the longsword style will oblige us to construct a toolkit that can then be used--by us, or by others--to create other examples of what we're calling MASEs (Martial Arts System Embodiments). If your thing is Japanese kenjutsu or Viking sword-and-board, then in principle CLANG should support it.\nRaising an army (or, in this case, building an enormous story-driven video game) is an expensive proposition and can take a number of years. In keeping with the scrappy, ragtag band of adventurers model, we are building this larger vision one step at a time. The next step is to build a functional proof of concept in the form of an exciting prototype we can share with you and use to achieve our next level of funding--which will enable us to provide more character models, more environments, and more MASEs. Which is to say, other weapons and styles from other places and eras. We are building a framework that can be expanded as far and as deeply as possible. We have, after all, several thousand years of martial history to draw from.              \nIn Which Neal goes into detail, as is his wont, regarding Clang:\nPlease read Technical Update #1 for details on CLANG design elements such as MASEs and In/Out of System movements.\nTechnical Update #2 covers our plans for the combat UI.\nIn Technical Update #3 Neal discusses timing, lag and tachypsychia.\nTechnical Update #4 goes more deeply into Sword Sync and Force Feedback.\nVideo update for reaching 50% of our goal.

If you're interested in getting news about the project and finding out how to get a copy of the book, please visit the project website, http://www.olympiccityproject.com. Thanks!\nThe Olympic City is a photography project by Jon Pack and Gary Hustwit that looks at the legacy of the Olympic Games in former host cities around the world. Hosting the Olympics has become a way for a city to show itself off on an international stage and generate toursim dollars, and cities spend millions or billions for the privilege. But after the events are over, the medals have been handed out, and the torch is extinguished, what's next? What happens to a city after the Olympics are gone?\nIn The Olympic City, we're documenting the successes and failures, the forgotten remnants and ghosts of the Olympic spectacle. Some former Olympic sites are retrofitted and used in ways that belie their grand beginnings; turned into prisons, housing, malls, gyms, churches. Others sit unused for decades and become tragic time capsules, examples of misguided planning and broken promises of the benefits that the Games would bring. We're interested in these disparate ideas \u2014 decay and rebirth \u2014 and how each site seems to have gone one way or the other, either by choice or circumstance. We're equally interested in the lives of the people whose neighborhoods have been transformed by Olympic development.\nA large-format hardcover art book (approximately 200 pages) will be published in March, 2013, in a limited edition of 1,000 copies. In addition to the photos, the book will feature text contributions from several writers we admire. Publication will coincide with an exhibition of the photographs in New York City and other cities, details TBA. We're also producing a digital version of the book, and 100 signed copies of a deluxe edition that will include two original photo prints from the project. \nWe're excited that acclaimed graphic designer Paul Sahre is designing the book:\nThe money raised in this Kickstarter campaign will cover travel, production, and design expenses, and the printing costs for the books (we're aiming for quality along the lines of publishers like Steidl) and the prints. \nWe've already photographed in Los Angeles, Montreal, Lake Placid, Athens, and Rome. We've just finished documenting Mexico City (see our updates) and we'll be shooting more cities this summer and fall. Which other Olympic cities will be included? We're keeping that under wraps for now, but if you back the project, you'll have a say. We'll be putting one of our city choices to a vote and letting our backers decide where we should go. Our backers will also get exclusive email dispatches and photos from the road this summer and fall, as we document the remaining cities. \nThanks!\nJon and Gary\n------------------\nP.S. - We'll be selling a limited number of copies of the book to art book stores and specialist shops.

It will center on the United States, but the stories will cover the world and I think it'll have strong relevance regardless of where you live. It will be a series with huge scope, but it'll be rooted in solid storytelling. I'll use history, science, psychology and economics to tell this story and I'll make it relevant, accessible and seriously entertaining.\nIt will primarily be a work of perspective. It's intended to give you some clarity and some context about where we are now. But it will also be my view of the material. It will have bias. I think it needs some commentary because frankly some ideas are bad, and this needs to be said. I'll demonstrate these things and I'll do it without cheap-shots or demonizing anybody. \nI'll also be raising my filmmaking to the highest level I can take it. And I'll do that by hiring the best collaborators I can get. So I'm going to raise my own game, I'm also going to add some all-stars to the team.\nThe first episode will land before the election.

It will be distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution license, meaning you will be able to use this media for any purpose so long as you provide attribution.

I'm an independent illustrator and designer living in CT, and for the past four years, I've been drawing something, anything, every Monday through Friday. December 21st marks my 1000th daily drawing. 1000th is a weird word, so that will be the last time I use it here.\nSince around Daily Drawing 217 I started thinking about putting together a book featuring all of my Dailies. At the time, I told myself I needed so many more drawings. At around Daily Drawing 493 I decided 1000 would be the right number. As I approached Daily Drawing 900 I started sweating profusely and wondering what I'd gotten myself into. ALAS, THE DAY IS UPON US! (I say 'us' to make you all feel involved, but really the day is upon me.)\nI'm not ashamed to say I want your help self-publishing this book because I want full control over the final product. The Daily Drawing project has changed my life in several significant ways and I need to honor that by putting out the product I want to put out. (Don't worry editors, I'm totally willing to let you have the reins on future projects.) Drawing every night gave me the confidence to move away from graphic design and towards illustration professionally, and to take the scary leap to freelancing full-time. All the projects I started getting as a result of my dailies didn't hurt either! Though these drawings cover a broad spectrum of topics and content they also serve as a memoir for the past 4 years of my life. I'm hoping to raise $5,500, which will be enough to print and bind the book. I've been staying up all hours to get the files organized (1000 is a lot!) and the pages laid out, and it's starting to take shape. If all continues as planned, 1000 Days of Drawing by Chris Piascik will be on bookshelves and coffee tables sometime in March.\nOver the years I have done a lot with these drawings. I've created a handful of zines\u2014one featured all of Major Taylor's guidelines for Good Habits and Clean Living. \nAnother was a collection of drawings documenting every bicycle I have ever owned\u2014and it's been a lot. \nI've done 4 different zines focused on hand-lettering. I've also screenprinted a bunch.\nMy good friend Stebs of Paper Fortress fame even made a video of me doing a drawing for Halloween a couple years back. Check it out!:\nThat video has had over 50k views! It was featured on Boing Boing and Draw!\nHow about some interesting statistics? \nThere are 8 sections in the book:\n1. Quotes \u2013 138 drawings\n2. Characters \u2013 140 drawings\n3. Improvised \u2013 124 drawings\n4. Bikes \u2013 48 drawings\n5. Music \u2013 111 drawings\n6. Politics \u2013 121 drawings\n7.

With your financial support, we'll be able to complete the editing, special effects, sound mixing, and color timing -- and bring a really special film to life.  \n***STILL ACCEPTING PLEDGES***\nThanks to your continuing support, we've met the minimum level for the Kickstarter drive to fund.  But we're still accepting pledges, to tackle the additional budget items, below.  So, why donate now? Self-interest, for one thing! The DVD price won't change, but by \"purchasing\" the DVD at the $25-level, now rather than later, it will help us make a better film, with features including....\nCLOSED CAPTIONING: We want this film to be accessible to everyone! Help us add a closed-captioning option to the DVD.  Additional Budget: $2,500\nANIMATIONS: We want to hire independent animators to create snippets and shorts to illustrate points of the film. We had already budgeted for a set amount of AfterEffects, but an increased animation budget will give more work to worthy artists, *and* make the film really shine. Additional Budget: $30,000\nHIGH-FIDELITY SOUND MASTERING: Good films live and die by their sound quality.  Listen to an indie film, and you'll see what we mean: They often sound terrible. With just a little extra, we can bring this film into Dolby. Additional Budget: $10,000\nTRAVEL: We've lined up additional interviews with folks like Jeannie Schulz, Mike & Jerry of Penny Arcade, and more. But we'd also still love to sit down with Lalo Alcaraz, Keith Knight, Matt Groening, Garry Trudeau, Randall Munroe, Art Speigelman, and others.  Additional funding will help make those trips possible for our crew and equipment. Additional budget: $10,000\n=============================\n***VIDEO UPDATE***\nThree new \"rough-cut\" moments (no sound correction, no color correction) from our interviews, including: Zach Weiner, Danielle Corsetto, and Howard Tayler!\n=============================\n***VIDEO UPDATE***\nFour new \"rough-cut\" moments (no sound correction, no color correction) from the film, including: Jeff Smith, Darrin Bell, Scott Kurtz, and Scott Mcloud!\n=============================\n***VIDEO UPDATE***\nFour new \"rough-cut\" moments (no sound correction, no color correction) from the film, including: Kate Beaton, Richard Thompson, Greg Evans and Ryan North!\n=============================\n\"Peanuts\" comic strip \u00a9 2011 Peanuts Worldwide LLC***NEW!
