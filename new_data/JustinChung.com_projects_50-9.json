They are designed from the ground up to be both the best camera bags and the best everyday carry on the planet.\nSkip ahead to: Backpack | Backpack Size | Tote | Sling | Range Pouch | Specs | FAQs\nHow to get them\nBecome a backer of this project and pick a reward. You will essentially be pre-ordering one of our new bags. You'll get a special backer discount, and you'll receive your stuff before it is available in stores. Want to buy more than one? Check outAll Rewards & Add-ons. Still confused? Check outHow to Back this Project.\nWe have no traditional investors. Instead, we launch products here on Kickstarter. The funds we raise here not only go towards manufacturing, they also help us design future products.\nAre these camera bags?\nLet's make one thing abundantly clear: these ain't just camera bags. They're Everyday bags\u2014crafted by a team of designers, engineers, and photographers to meet the needs of everyone in the modern world. \nWe may have cut our teeth in the camera accessories world, but these bags are for everyone, just like our (award-winning*) Everyday Messenger that we designed and launched a year ago with the help of renowned adventure photographer Trey Ratcliff. Peak Design Everyday Bags are unrivaled as camera bags and uncompromising as everyday companions.\nEveryday Backpack\nSimply put, a backpack without compromises. Available in Charcoal and Ash, and in 20L and 30L sizes. Unless otherwise specified, all pictures are of the 20L Everyday Backpack.\nWhat makes the Everyday Backpack so stacked?\nFind your size\nLooking for detailed specs on size and laptop/tablet carry capacity? See our FAQ at the bottom of this page.\n                                                                                                                                                                                 Everyday Tote\nThe classic tote bag, completely reimagined to protect, organize, and provide lightning-fast access to your camera gear and everyday carry (think beach, gym, traveling, diapers, etc). Available in Charcoal and Ash.\nWhat makes the Everyday Tote so dope?\n                                                                                                  Everyday Sling\nThe ultimate low-profile, quick-access day bag for light carry and daily excursions. Makes a great bag for beginning photographers or pros who just want to carry essentials. Also a fantastic option for the non-photographer who just wants a sleek everyday bag. Available in Charcoal and Ash.\nWhat makes the Everyday Sling so bling? \nRange Pouch\nThe Range Pouch is specifically designed to protect and carry lenses on belts, straps, or in bags, available in three sizes. Like our Everyday Bags, the Range Pouch is intelligently designed, expandable, versatile, and feature-packed.\nWhy do we vouch for the Range Pouch?\n                  Comparison and Specs\nHow to Back\n1. Choose a reward level.\nEverybody can choose one (and only one) reward level to back this project. You cannot choose 2 reward levels. Just one. You will get all items in that reward\u2014you cannot swap things that you don't want for things that you do want. See the FAQ for why we can't do this.\n2. If you want to add something, check out the Add-On Menu.\nIf (and only if) you want to add something additional to your reward, check out the Add-On Menu below. If it's in the Add-On Menu you can add it to your reward by increasing your pledge by the amount specified in the menu. You can only add things to your reward that are in the Add-On Menu.\nIf you want to add on a Peak Design product that you don't see in the Add-On Menu, don't worry. We'll give you a chance to do that after our campaign ends. See the FAQ for further explanation.\n3. Relax, you're done for now.\nAll details like shipping information, color preference, and add-on specifics will be collected via survey after this campaign has ended.\nRewards and Add-Ons\n1% For The Planet\nThis year we have the privilege of joining 1% For The Planet. In doing so, we pledge to donate 1% of our revenue (gross revenue, not just profit) to a group of certified environmental nonprofits.\nPlease note that per Kickstarter guidelines, we cannot use this crowdfunding project to raise funds for charity. We will certainly support our beneficiary orgs outside of Kickstarter, and celebrate this commitment with our backer community.\nThank you for your support!\nWe can't say it enough. Thank you for believing in us. We can't wait to get these new products in your hands.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is Peak Design's 6th Kickstarter project. We don't want to toot our own horn too vigorously (nobody likes an overly vigorous tooter) but we've got some great experience under our belts on how to manufacture high-quality goods and fulfill lots of orders for them. We've also been blindsided more than once by completely unexpected issues and always dealt with them in a way that leaves every last customer happy with their purchase and proud to support our company.\n\nIn short, we know what we're doing, and you should be very confident that we will deliver what we say we will, when we say we will. And we solemnly swear that should unforeseen issues come up, we will handle them with the utmost transparency and care for you, our backers.\n\nSupply Chain Risk: We're incredibly proud of our supply chain, and have a lot of confidence that we can make what we say we'll make, when we say we'll make it. But know what? Sometimes 10 shipping containers of product get stuck outside a shipyard for 3 weeks. We pad our schedule for these kind of things, but sometimes not enough.\n\nActs of God: We're based in San Francisco. That means we could have an earthquake. Or we could have a massive spur-of-the-moment parade involving wacky costumes and public nudity. Or, god forbid, the Dodgers could come to town. Whatever happens, we'll get through it together.

It's been an amazing journey and we are now manufacturing the first batch of The SilverAir Travel Underwear. To pre-order underwear, check out our website - https://www.yathletics.com\n Underwear rides up. Underwear smells. Sometimes, it gets hot and stuffy. Sometimes it loses shape. And when we\u2019re going away for the week, we need to stuff half our bags with underwear. That\u2019s just how it is. We wanted to change that.\nOur goal is not to \u201cpitch\u201d you the product (that\u2019s what our video is for!). Rather, we'll teach you something about it. We want you to really be able to see and experience the purposeful design and technology that went into creating these boxer briefs. Here are the highlights:\nSMARTGRIP NO RIDE-UP SYSTEM\nWhen we asked our backers what they disliked about their existing underwear, the most common feedback was that it rides and bunches up. So, we dug deep into the issue and discovered that the length of the legs and the elasticity of the fabric are contributing factors. Longer length holds better but when they ride up, there is more fabric that bunches up as well. So we adjusted the length to be just right and added spandex for superior elasticity. But we didn't stop there...\nWe created a brand new solution that we call SmartGrip. Inspired by grip systems in high-end cycling apparel, we called upon the best grip manufacturer and implemented cycling grips in our underwear. It worked, but the friction felt uncomfortable. After some more experimentation, we created our own custom grip system using soft silicones that you barely feel against your skin but which creates just enough resistance for the leg band to stay in place. The result is underwear that simply stays put.\nSILVERAIR ANTI STINK TECHNOLOGY\nThis is our signature technology and we\u2019ve incorporated it into the fabric of the underwear. It\u2019s the same silver that you\u2019ll find in our shirts and socks. Unlike most anti-odor solutions, ours is not a topical treatment. It's permanent and will never wash away. When it comes to anti-odor performance, this is the gold standard.\nHow does it work? The chemistry is simple. Sweat is mostly water and doesn\u2019t have any smell. But the bacteria present in sweat often create unpleasant odors. Silver has the ability to break down bacteria and prevent them from reproducing, so the pure silver yarns permanently infused into our fabric helps to keep our underwear fresh and odor free.\nPREMIUM MERINO FABRIC\nFabric is the heart of our products, and it\u2019s what we spend most of our time on. Some of the best underwear we\u2019ve worn is made from cotton, but cotton does not have any performance features. On the other hand, performance fibers like nylon and polyester tend to hold odor and can get uncomfortable after a few hours. We found the perfect solution in high end Merino Wool, which wicks moisture and can naturally regulate temperature.\nSourced from one of the best sheep farms in Australia, our Merino Wool is a 17.5 micron gauge - one of the finest in the industry. The use of ultra fine yarns allows us to create a fabric that's super soft. We also added spandex as underwear tends to lose their shape after being worn for half a day. The stretch fabric in this underwear not only holds its shape but it gives you increased flexibility for easier movement.\n  We are Y Athletics, and our mission is to simplify your life with thoughtfully designed gear you can fall in love with. To do that, we engineer each product from scratch, with materials and components tailored specifically towards them. By focusing on every single detail, we are able to strike the perfect balance between performance, comfort, and style. We don't make too many products, but whatever we do make screams quality and craftsmanship.\n3 years ago, we launched our first product through Kickstarter. The community here funded our dream and we delivered a 5 star product that is loved by thousands of people from around the globe. Last year, we did it again with our socks.\nAnother year and dozens of prototypes later, we\u2019re back with our third and we couldn't have been more proud. We\u2019re calling it The Ultimate Travel Underwear because it's going to change the way you travel. In reality, it's the best damn underwear for daily wear as well.\n    UNDERWEAR\nWe are making the underwear in the boxer brief style in three colors:\nGraphite Grey & Electric Blue are renderings\n  Swatches of actual colors\n SHIRTS\nShirts will be available in your choice of crew or v neck in 3 colors: Charcoal Grey, Alloro Green & Glacier Silver. Additional color options from here may be added depending on availability.\nSOCKS\nSocks will be available in the ankle length in your choice of four colors: Jet Black, Glacier White, Ithaca Green, and Sedona Red.\nUNDERWEAR\nOur underwear will be manufactured in sizes S-XXL and will cover waist sizes 28\" all the way to 46\". The size guide will be available when we send out the surveys.\nSHIRTS & SOCKS\nCheck out https://www.yathletics.com/pages/sizing\nThe underwear has been under development for more than a year. We've overcome most of the challenges and are ready to go into production. Below is an estimated timeline for production. You'll be the first to know if anything changes.\n  GENERAL CAUTION\nWe offer the best deals to backers of our Kickstarter campaigns. Backers are also the first to receive new products and they get to see exciting progress of our production. The money you pledge towards our campaign goes directly into the development and production of our products. This campaign is not a store front. If you want full service from Y Athletics, please purchase products from yathletics.com at retail value when they're available.\nREFUNDS\nWe reserve the right to issue or deny any requested refunds. If we issue a refund, we will deduct 10% from it because that amount has already been taken from your pledge as fees for the payment processor and Kickstarter.\nEXCHANGES\nWe want you to be satisfied with your reward. If the product you receive does not fit, you may exchange the unworn items for a different size. We cannot exchange underwear and sock once the package is opened so we recommend trying one pair before opening the remaining ones. For exchanges, you\u2019ll have to send the product back to us at your own expense and then pay for shipping the new product back to you.\nINTERNATIONAL BACKERS\nWe ship internationally to select countries using FedEx and USPS. You will be given the choice to select your preferred carrier at the end of the campaign.\nAll international shipments are subject to duties, taxes and clearing fees which you are responsible for paying. All Kickstarter rewards will be declared 'gifts', however, most countries will assess duties/taxes and in certain countries the carrier will pre-pay the duties and taxes and bill you later. If you refuse delivery, your package will be abandoned. Once abandoned, we can\u2019t ship another package to you or issue a refund.\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our fourth Kickstarter project. We\u2019ve delivered some of the highest quality products to our backers in the past and this one\u2019s not going to be any different. The only risk we can think of is the projected timeline of the delivery of rewards. Since this is a brand new development, there may be unforeseen challenges when we start production. If any issues come up, the delivery of your reward will be delayed.\n\nThat said, we\u2019re pretty straight forward when it comes to communication and have built a reputation of being transparent with our backers. We'll make two promises:\n\n1. We will deliver the highest quality product to each and every single backer. We take extreme pride in making some of the best products in the world and will never compromise on quality.\n\n2. We will keep the lines of communication open at all times.

These innovative fibers prevent the growth of unwanted bacteria \u2013 and will never wash away.\nAs Seen On: \n    Why are we laying our fresh faces onto a pillowcase that hasn\u2019t been washed in days?\nAfter just one night of use, your pillowcase and bed sheets can accumulate a horrifying array of bacteria, allergens and fungus. Dermatologists recommend washing your pillowcase every two or three days. But who has time for that?\nThe average adult washes their sheets every 2-3 weeks.\nStudies suggest that some men change their sheets just four times a year and women, every two and a half weeks ... Sound about right? Our fabric is engineered to stay fresh, clean and comfortable night after night \u2014 regardless of how often you toss them in the washer.\n What makes Silvon special?\nAntimicrobial Silver: By fusing innovative fibers with natural silver, our fabric is 99.9% effective in preventing bacterial growth on the fabric surface.\nCompletely Permanent: Similar products wash out or degrade in strength over time. However, because the silver is woven directly into our fabric, it will never wash away.\nIncredibly Soft: We\u2019ve paired our technology with Supima cotton grown right here in the USA. Supima cotton is among the softest, most durable cotton in the world.\nAll Natural \u2013 No Chemicals: Similar products use harsh chemical treatments to adhere silver particles to fabrics. We use the real thing \u2013 99% pure natural silver.\nEco-Friendly: With Silvon we find new uses for the materials that naturally exist right in front of us. These advanced textiles also increase the time you can go between launderings. This helps save water and energy on a large scale.\nPure Natural Silver\nSilver is naturally oligodynamic \u2013 simply put this means that it prevents the growth of bacteria. By fusing our fibers with natural silver, these antimicrobial properties are permanently ingrained in the fabric.\nWe couldn\u2019t help but notice all the amazing qualities of natural silver. In fact, it made us wonder why such an incredible, natural resource had never been used in bedding before.\nA New Category of Bedding\nFor ages, the fabric we rest on has remained unchanged. We think it\u2019s time to change that.\nWe are constantly seeking new ways to use the world\u2019s smartest natural materials. After years of research, we harnessed the incredible benefits of natural silver to create an innovative fabric that will, hopefully, create a whole new category of bedding.\nThe Science\nBasically, silver carries a positive charge, and bacteria is negative (go figure). The silver is attracted to the bacteria, breaks its cell wall and the bacteria is destroyed before it has a chance to reproduce.\nAdvanced technology now allows us to weave silver coated fibers directly into our fabric. These silver fibers are proven to eliminate 99.9% of the bacteria on your entire pillowcase.\n500% zoom\nDoes it work?\nThis technology has been verified by more than a decade of testing at research institutions including Pennsylvania State University and Cornell University. Silvon is tested in accordance with the highest antimicrobial standards (ASTM E2149). These lab tests have shown a 99.9% reduction in bacteria on the fabric. Furthermore, Our fabric is put through rigorous wash tests to ensure protection that will last the lifetime of the product.\nGreat. But comfy?\nAdvanced silver fibers and supple Supima cotton come together to create the perfect sleep surface.\nA pillowcase isn\u2019t much good if it\u2019s not conducive to an amazing night\u2019s sleep. That\u2019s why we combined our technology with long-staple Supima cotton. One hundred percent of this cotton is grown in the US, and it\u2019s among the most durable, softest cotton in the world.\nHow It\u2019s Made\nNo harsh chemicals, no nanotechnology \u2013 those were our guidelines. We\u2019ve partnered with a US-based antimicrobial tech company that uses natural silver to prevent bacterial growth on fabrics. Their proprietary process completely covers advanced fibers with silver while allowing them to remain extremely soft, flexible and comfortable.\nResponsibility\nSilvon is committed to manufacturing products that surpass the most stringent safety and environmental protection standards. All of our products are Oeko-Tex certified, which means that it supports human ecology through bio-compatibility and the absence of harmful substances in the manufacturing\nOh, and if you have a furry friend?\nYour pet may be bringing more than love and warmth to your bed. Your four-legged friend is another source that enables bacteria, mold and allergens to grow.\nColors Options\nSilvon is now available in two colors, Grey and White. You can select any reward, and at the end of the campaign we will contact all of our backers to confirm your color selection.\nThe Silvon Sheets\nThe Silvon Sheets are now available in both color options. You can select any size, and at the end of the campaign we will contact all of our backers to confirm your color selection. Each sheet set includes 1 fitted sheet, 1 flat sheet and 2 pillowcases.\nSize Guide:\n  Simplicity in design\nWe think less is more, which is why we don\u2019t include unnecessary patterns or detailing. Instead, we designed the simplest, most comfortable fabric we could, using premium natural materials, without the premium price.\nDetails Make The Difference\nFrom pillowcases with a tidy envelope closure to sheets with grippy elastic, all of our products incorporate thoughtful details with you in mind.\nCare Instructions\nAlthough our fabric helps keep bacteria from swarming your pillowcase, dust and other debris can sometimes accumulate. We recommend washing every 10-14 days with your normal laundry. Wash it on a cool or warm cycle, and tumble dry on low heat or hang to dry. Do not use chlorine bleach.\nAdvanced textiles can also be beneficial to the environment. Silvon will increase the time you go in between launderings, saving water and energy.\nWhy Us?\nWe don\u2019t wear the same tee shirt for weeks on end \u2013 why do we lay onto a pillowcase that hasn\u2019t been washed in days? This simple question became the beginning of an incredible journey to make a revolutionary fabric that would, hopefully, create a whole new category of bedding. \nAlmost two years ago we launched our first product, SleepClean. It was an instant success. We had thousands of happy customers, and can be found in retail stores around the world.\nBut we constantly ask whether there is a better way. We wanted to create a solution that was completely permanent and avoid the use of any chemicals in our manufacturing process. We searched for new ways to use the world\u2019s smartest natural materials. After years of researching, testing, and chasing this vision, we\u2019ve harnessed the incredible benefits of natural silver to create a pillowcase and then bed sheets like no other.\nRewards:\nAdd-ons and Adjusting Your Pledge\nIf you would like to add additional products to your pledge, simply add the price of the additional product to your current pledge amount.

This natural fabric is made from 4 different fibres to create a high-stretch, ultra-lightweight solution engineered to keep you comfortable and cool. These fibres interact with each other in a way that promotes the various beneficial properties of each, while offsetting their individual weaknesses. The TENCEL\u00ae, content absorbs moisture away from the skin and into the fabric fibres is perfect for hot temperatures, and is also a natural bacteria repellant that prevents bacteria from rapid growth. This allows for the pants to be worn your entire trip without any accompanying smell. The polyester content creates durability and strength for high-movement adventures, while the cotton content allows for breathability, and creates a soft natural feel. Lastly, spandex is what gives the fabric it's amazing stretch providing ultimate comfort and maneuverability. All-in-all the best fabric for hot weather wear.\n    Too hot for pants? We feel you! Whether you're outside on a summer day, or travelling somewhere warm, pants can be hot, sweaty, restrictive, and uncomfortable. Shorts sometimes work, but there are plenty of times when you need a little more coverage - whether that's to show up for a meeting, attend a wedding, or even hike through the bush. The \u201chot weather/travel pants\u201d currently on the market are dorky, too informal, gimmicky, and made with synthetic materials that don't breathe well.\nWe developed the Live Lite pants specifically for travelling and hot weather wear, with a lightweight, breathable, anti-bacterial and high stretch fabric engineered to keep you comfortable and cool. We used this fabric to create various styles that put all other hot weather and travel pants to shame. By combining our years of experience in the fashion industry with our knowledge of technical fabrics, we've created pants that are both stylish and functional, with the added features you need while travelling. Pack less, travel light, Live Lite. You deserve better than zip-off pants.\n                 The Live Lite pants keep you cool in hot weather and can be worn from business meetings to wilderness adventures, but there may be days where you can get more casual or show a little leg - but still want the same great fabric and design features. \nThese shorts are made with the same T2X fabric as the Live Lite pants, plus many of the same travel features. You can receive the Journey Shorts with your current pledge by simply adding $50 to your current pledge (per pair of shorts) with no additional shipping fees. At a retail price of $89 this is a screaming deal only offered to our current Kickstarter backers. These shorts are only available as an Add On, not as a standalone pledge.\n      Help us meet our goal of $50,000!  Once we do we will unlock the colour Storm Blue. We heard your comments from our last projects and our happy to offer a blue option, but only after we reach our goal, so get pledging!  \n Our backers voted on a new colour, and Woodlands was the winner!  All pant styles, men's and women's, will be available in this colour. The Journey Shorts will not be available in this colour. \n                                                                Dish and DUER is a start up filled with people who lead active lifestyles and recognize the need for clothing that can transition from work to play, and anything in between. We want to look and feel good, and know that our customers want the same. For these reasons we continue to innovate, design, and produce technical garments that meet the needs of active individuals.\nWe recognized that in addition to our current fabrics we needed a light-weight option that was appropriate for an urban setting during the warmer months. We loved the fibre make-up and performance of our No Sweat fabric, so we built on this foundation. We adjusted the composition and weaved the fibres in a different way to provide a high-stretch, lightweight solution. Once we saw the final fabric we realized that it was perfect for travel wear; comfortable, durable, and lightweight. By adding discreet features that provide convenience and security while travelling, we produced the Best Hot Weather Pants perfect for travel.\nOur small company has grown because of the support of our Kickstarter backers, who helped us launch our Performance Stretch Denim in September 2014 and then our No Sweat fabric in October 2015.

Five years after the devastating Chaos War. The Sky Cities have fallen from the sky, other-dimensional creatures called the Weird have emerged from the rift caused by the Sky Cities destruction. The Weird can't survive here for long unless they take a being to use as their shell. Living or dead--it doesn't matter to them. Hexers are the only ones who can destroy the Weird--and most of them died in the Chaos War. Hexer Xane Dusk is one of the last Hexers. \n  Hexer Dusk is a gripping tale where dimensions collide, terrifying other-dimensional creatures invade and martial magic users called Hexers defend a galaxy on the edge of chaos.\n \"My name is Xane Dusk. I'm one of the last Hexers. Time was, being a Hexer was an honorable thing. We protected, we served; we had a Code. That all changed the day the Sky Cities destroyed each other in the Chaos War. I was a soldier--I was there. I saw it happen. The destruction of the Cities burned a rift between dimensions--a big hole that let other-dimensional creatures through to Obsidian galaxy. We called them the Weird. They can't survive here long unless they find a body to inhabit. Lucky for them, they're good at grabbing up both the living and dead to use as their shells. Bad for us. Maybe now us Hexers finally have a true enemy to fight--if the Razers don't kill us all first. Sever taught me that what Hexers did was for the good of the galaxy. These days, I do what I must and my reasons are my own. My name is Xane Dusk. I'm one of the last Hexers.\"\nHEXER DUSK\n\nMost of my dreams are pretty mundane, but not the one that inspired Hexer Dusk.  It was one of those dreams that feels real-- like you are there. On an alien world, I watched as two sky cities began to light up--then explode--like suns going supernova. As the dying light washed over the landscape and the debris began to fall, I knew that everything I'd ever known had changed... \nThe dream didn't stick around to tell me the rest, but the images haunted my daydreams. The bones of the world of Obsidia and rogue Hexer, Xane Dusk, evolved over the next couple of years--a post-apocalyptic galaxy of martial magic, monsters, alien species and grungy tech. \nStar Wars and Hawks\nJohn Ostrander and I had a blast collaborating on Hawkman for DC and Star Wars stories at Dark Horse. We created Legacy, Cade Skywalker, Quinlan Vos, Aayla Secura, the Imperial Knights and a legion of other characters. None of these characters belonged to us, but we gave them our hearts and souls anyway because we were doing what we love to do!\nThe Hexer Dusk Team\nJohn and I have a dynamic collaboration process. We weave our ideas together and the end result always gets me excited to draw the story. We'd often talked about doing something creator owned, so it seemed like a given that we could bring the kind of energy and teamwork we'd brought to other projects to Hexer Dusk. I told John about the story and he agreed that it was perfect for the Indy project we'd always wanted to do.\nThose of you who know John's and my work, know that we're passionate about art and story--and about creating characters, creatures and worlds for them to inhabit. For me, Hexer Dusk is the amalgam of everything I love to draw and imagine. For both John and me, it's a new far away galaxy to explore. \nI hope you will take a look at this Kickstarter--and if you like what you see--if you're curious to see more, stay a while and explore this new galaxy with us. This is the first Hexer Dusk story--but we have a lot more stories we want to tell-- who am I kidding-- that we need to tell!\n--Jan Duursema \nThe Fall of the Sky Cities. That\u2019s what grabbed me. The image, the idea, of two great cities at war, with high towers, massive and incongruously floating above the planet, exploding and falling in mutual destruction. I could see them. I could hear them \u2013 a terrible noise. I could almost smell it. That\u2019s what grabbed me when Jan told me about the idea she had for Hexer Dusk. \nThat\u2019s what you look for when you\u2019re starting a project \u2013 something that excites your imagination, that makes you ask questions, to want to know more, to know what it means. To know what the story is. With the images came words, all evocative: Obsidian. Scavvers. The Weird. Skargle and The Missus. Kombot. Hexer Dusk. That\u2019s how a story is grown. Those are the seeds. That\u2019s how it starts. An idea, an image that comes from within you and that you need to incarnate. To make physical. To make real. And it\u2019s already begun.\n--John Ostrander\nHEXER DUSK WILL BE A FULL COLOR 72 PAGE GRAPHIC NOVEL!\n        PAGE 8\n PAGE 9\n    HEXER XANE DUSK\n  HEXERS gain new tattoos as they master new hexes.\n          KOMbot MECH AKA \"KOMBOT\" Don't let Kombot's friendly grin fool you. This mech has what it takes to fight the Weird.\n  Calyx is a Obsidian Masq and Hexer. Native to the planet Obsidia, Calyx is a rare combination of Obsidian and Masquer.\n  SKULBAT'S are found everywhere in the Obsidian Galaxy. Xane Dusk's ship is named after these scavenger creatures.\n  THE MISSUS is a powerhouse. Her species is naturally radioactive.\n  Never let a Rag Baby see you.\n STRETCH GOALS!\nSTRETCH GOAL #1 IS UNLOCKED! 19K Diecut Skulbat sticker included in rewards $15 and up!\nSTRETCH GOAL #2 IS UNLOCKED! 21K Die cut KOMBOT sticker included in rewards $15 and up!\nSTRETCH GOAL #3 IS UNLOCKED! 26K B&W DIGITAL UNWRAPPED PDF included in all rewards $10 and up.\nSTRETCH GOAL # 4 IS UNLOCKED--BONUS 6 PAGE STORY included in rewards $10 and up\nSTRETCH GOAL #5 37K LOCKED SKULBAT PATCH included in rewards $20 and up\nSTRETCH GOAL #6 45K LOCKED PRINT VERSION B&W UNWRAPPED HEXER DUSK added to rewards $20 and up\nSTRETCH GOAL #7 50K LOCKED 12 page BONUS STORY added to rewards $10 and up \nHEXER DUSK will be a 72 page FULL COLOR  trade paperback graphic novel which will include pre-production 'making of' sketches for this new series. The cover will be 14 pt cover stock with 85 lb text full-color interior. Reward tiers $25 and up will have a signed and numbered bookplate. The writing is done and 13 pages of art are penciled and inked. If we open up some stretch goals, we could even add another short story to the TPB!\nWHY GO INDY?\nWe've worked on comic series for major comic book publishers and licensed franchises our entire careers. It's been a heck of a great ride and we'd both love to do more of that in the future! It's a certainty that Hexer Dusk could not have happened without the experience we gained working in mainstream comics. But at the end of that journey, the characters we created for others companies and the stories we told don't belong to us. We knew going in that we don't control their fates, but...\nWith Hexer Dusk, we want to create a story that we can do more than just be a  part of. We have a distinct vision of the world of Obsidia and the characters we are creating for it. We want to shape that story into reality the way we see it. Doing Hexer Dusk as an Indy project through Kickstarter give us the opportunity to do that!\nThanks for coming by and taking a look at our Kickstarter! We hope you will back Hexer Dusk and enjoy reading the first book of what we dream will become a series! \n How do Add-Ons Work?\nOnce you're a backer for a shipped reward level $20 and up, you can add on to your order like this:\n--Add up the total of your Add-Ons\n--Click the blue 'Manage' Button in the upper right hand corner.\n--Add the total of your Add-On's to your pledge amount.\n--You don't need to change the tier you've already selected.\n--That's it! After the campaign ends, we'll send you a survey and you will be able to easily select the Add-Ons you wanted.\n  Why is postage separate and not included in the reward?  Keeping track of the reward tiers can get confusing--especially when offering shipping to anywhere in the world. Keeping the postage separate simplifies the levels, ensuring that everyone receives the reward they pledged!\nWe will also be able to offer no extra shipping for Add-Ons for packages under 4 libs--so you will be able to order an ADD-ON copy for Hexer Dusk for a friend with no extra shipping!\nWHERE DOES THE FUNDING GO?\nPublishing a book like Hexer Dusk isn't cheap. You have to factor in the cost of printing, postage, manufacturing rewards and Kickstarter fees, packing supplies...etc. Hexer Dusk will be in full color, so we need to hire a colorist and a letterer--as well as make sure the creators can keep the lights on while producing the the art and writing!  If we exceed our goal? First we'll dance like mad Skulbats... then we'd create MORE Hexer Dusk stories! Ultimately, we hope to make this first TPB into a series of sci-fi adventures in the Obsidian Galaxy.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nEvery project has the potential to be delayed.

It\u2019s time to think of all the stuff you can do with your time besides laundry.\nAbly Apparel is activated with Filium\u2122, a technology that makes natural fabrics repel liquids, stains, and odors. The first time we saw our prototypes in action, we had to pick our jaws off the floor. Pour water on an Ably shirt, spill coffee or wine, and it just beads up and rolls off like it\u2019s on glass.\nUnlike most performance apparel, ABLY clothing doesn\u2019t absorb sweat. Your perspiration just evaporates through the breathable fabric, keeping your clothes fresh. You can wear our shirts to the gym every day for a week and it\u2019ll still smell new. It\u2019s not 100% waterproof, so if you get dunked you\u2019ll still get wet\u2014but your Ably shirt or hoodie will dry up to 40% faster than regular cotton. There are other products on the market now that promise similar repellant properties, but they use a nanoparticle coating. Our technology doesn\u2019t use nanoparticles or toxic chemicals that can leach into your skin or the environment. Filium\u2019s core technology is produced according to bluesign\u00ae standards for sustainable materials and production.\n                                                     These are prototypes. We\u2019re still messing with some of the details and looking for new features to add, so the final product may be a little different. We\u2019ll let you know about any changes, and If you have any suggestions or requests we\u2019d love to hear them.\nWe think this product is amazing even if it\u2019s just one incredible shirt or hoodie in your wardrobe. (Or five. Or ten. Don\u2019t let us hold you back.) Doing laundry uses a lot of energy and resources. Washing and drying one load of laundry every two days creates about 970 lbs of CO2 every year.

Fighting bacteria, regulating temperatures and reducing sweat.\nWe've taken the data and input from our last successful Kickstarter and created a line of basics for the busy modern man. A line of basics that will stay fresh after a long day at the office or a quick session in the gym, never having to worry about smelling bad or nasty bacteria. \nThe Products\nSocks\nWe've been working with our sock manufacturer for almost a year now. We've made and tested dozens of prototypes and feel confident in bringing them to you. The socks you see in pictures are ready for production and we'll start manufacturing them as soon as we are able to raise the funds for production.\nBoxer briefs\nOur manufacturer out of Izmir Turkey, was the first textile company in Turkey to be organic. They put great pride in working with organic materials and have an inspiring mindset for sustainability. When we first talked to them about our idea they didn\u2019t think it was possible to bring such a complicated and expensive technology only used in space suits and military performance clothing to the greater consumer. At the end, we convinced them to believe in our vision. 1 year after we stand together with a product so great no one thought was possible to create. Help us reach our goal by backing this campaign.\nT-Shirts\nBuilt for performance, this T-shirt will stay fresh and odorless all day. Silver fibers are permanently infused into our fabric, which keeps your shirts fresh all day for the entire lifetime of the t-shirt. The silver fiber does this by fighting the odor-causing bacteria. We\u2019ve engineered a t-shirt fabric by knitting organic long fiber cotton with our SilverTech Performance Silver, and added a nip of elastane to give it the perfect fit and stretch. The result is a shirt that is so soft, smooth and light that it will almost feel like your second skin \u2013 naturally keeping your body dry and acclimatised.\nWhy Silver?\nPure silver is a metal that can naturally be extracted from mother earth. There are no artificial chemicals in our 99.99% pure silver, and it is ofcourse nontoxic. Of all metals known to mankind, silver is known for being the most efficient reflector as well as the best electrical-,and thermal conductor. But most importantly silver is known for its oligodynamic effect; a biocidal effect that controls microbial growth and kills bacteria with silver ions. \nThis is why silver can be found in many places in human history as a bacteria killer. Silverware is a great example of self-sanitizing cutlery, in the same way as silver water bottles carried by military commanders on expeditions for protection against diseases. Lately innovation has brought the natural pure silver fibers into new use; from bandages to toilet seats. Historically seen, silver has thus always had a professional relation to the human body, and now Organic Basics want to bring the super fiber to your closet. \nSkin protecting smart wear\nWith SilverTech we have created a cutting edge smart fabric. A line of basics produced in the latest performance fabrics that work as an extra natural dimension to your skin. Through science fiction movies and super hero-comic books, we have seen people dressed up in bodysuits with super human capabilities that naturally work with their bodies. Now Organic Basics is taking the first step in that direction by developing the of future underwear.\nBy working with natural elements such as pure silver and organic cotton, we've created a fabric that enhances the capabilities of your skin; keeping you warm when it\u2019s cold and cooling you down when it\u2019s warm. At the same time helping your body control micro bacterial growth and kill the unwanted bacteria. With this line of basics we've focused on the three most important pieces of underwear that will help stay warm, clean and odorless.\nResponsible Innovation\nIn Organic Basics, sustainability is a core value and something we focus on in every aspect of our work - from production to packaging to end-consumer use. This is also why we, in our textile production, only use GOTS and Oeko-tex 100 certified organic cotton, certified pure silver, and WRAP certified labor.\nFor packaging we only use reused and sustainable materials. In our choice of clothing there are two mayor factors to consider when looking at sustainability. Firstly, the longevity of the product is essential to the sustainability of the clothing; will it last one year or ten years? Secondly we need to consider the water consumption due to washing. Is it something you need to wash everyday or twice a week? With SilverTech we have been working with pure silver and long fiber organic cotton creating a high quality fabric made to last +10 years and with active silver controlling microbial growth potentially bringing down machine washes by 50 percent. Goodbye to fast fashion and goodbye to planned obsolescence.\nThe story of Organic Basics\nOrganic Basics was born on Kickstarter with the help and support of hundreds of backers from over 35 countries. Backers who believed in our dream to change the underwear industry. A lot of you backers are still loyal customers and backing our dream.  \nPLAY\n\nOur dream is to develop and create products that are always challenging the technology and at the same time always minimizing the impact our production and products have on the environment.  \n1.5 year ago we launched our company Organic Basics \u2013 Organic underwear and socks \u2013and our awesome backers raised more than $20.000 to kickstart our dream. We\u2019ve been working hard to develop our company, and are now ready to introduce what we\u2019ve spent many months and hundreds of hours on developing. We are proud to introduce the SilverTech line \u2013 It\u2019s elegant. It\u2019s comfortable. It\u2019s odorless. It\u2019s the future of underwear. \nDevelopment\nThe FLEXSIL Performance Silver is a brand new performance fabric. We sourced the finest long fiber organic cotton from our supplier in Turkey, known for its natural durability and consistent high quality. We added a nip of elastane for stretch recoverability. Finally, we blended our FLEXSIL Performance silver which is spun from pure silver and polyester with our fine organic cotton on the areas that accumulate the most heat and thereby sweat, which takes the odor-fighting capability of this fabric to a whole new level, unlike anything you have ever experienced. Our method with FLEXSIL spun directly into the product, the silver effects will last the lifetime of the product. We have actively chosen NOT to work with silver nanoparticles that will wash out after just a few washes. \nPLAY\n\nWe have worked intensely with our designers and construction specialist from Turkey, and from there we iterated until it was just right. We used seamless knitting to create a sock without any stitches and added vent zones that allow airflow to keep your feet cool and comfortable. This is elegant yet highly functional. After you've worn it a few times, you won\u2019t be able to go back to anything else.\nTesting and improvement\nWe've been testing our prototypes rigorously over the last 9 months. From the first prototypes we\u2019ve been testing for everything from heat-transfer capabilities to odor-fighting powers to hard washing and drying. It wasn\u2019t perfect when we started, but after 9 month of improvement and constant optimization we can finally present a product worth the future generations.\nThe Production\nThis is where YOU come in. We're still a young brand that is completely self-funded, and to bring the SilverTech to market, we need to manufacture them at a moderate scale. Help us fund our first production batch of the SilverTech Underwear and be the first to try out the next generation of underwear. We depend on you, and we need you to help us build a greener future for underwear.\nFind your size\nDelivery schedule\nHelp us spread the word\nWe started this journey here on Kickstarter, and we want to keep travelling with our awesome backers and the Organic Basics community. We need your help to get the word out, so whether you\u2019re talking to friends or family or sharing it on facebook every help is humbly appreciated.

Our phones, watches, and other gadgets are all updated with the latest technology, so why weren't we given smarter clothing options as well?\nThe Problem\nBig active-wear brands offer a ridiculous amount of options, which all have the same problem. They stink. Literally. After a long workout, pickup game, or run, the shirts smell terrible! Even after multiple washes, these odors can remain for the lifetime of the garment.\nNormal Shirts Stink!\nOur Solution\nWe decided to create Buffer, a brand that delivers only the highest quality functional performance apparel. \nIn order to do this we were laser focused in three key areas: Functionality. Quality. Design.\nAfter months of hard work designing, sourcing the highest quality fabric, and identifying the best manufacturer for our goals. In the process, we identified technology used in hospitals that could be applied to fabric and create an odor free, antimicrobial gym tee. We then created the most advanced fitness shirt available: Buffer\n Buffer Is:\nOdor Resistant: Copper ions are permanently infused in our nylon/spandex fabric creating a 99% antimicrobial shirt.\nQuick Dry/Moisture Wicking: Our fabric is knit so that sweat and moisture is pulled from the inside and brought to the outside, so it can evaporate as fast as possible. \nComfort Fit: We've designed the shirt to rest closely to your body, allowing our fabric's 4-way stretch to give you full range of motion for any activity.\nFlatlock Seams: The shoulder and side seams are stitched together with no seam allowance, meaning they rest flat on the body, without extra fabric, giving you a comfortable chafe-free wear.\nHow Our Odor Free Fabric Works\nCopper nanoparticles are permanently bonded to our nylon/spandex fabric through electroplating, which causes the fabric to be 99% antimicrobial. Copper attacks microbes in a three step process.\n1. Air combined with moisture causes the copper in your shirt to oxidize, which releases copper ions (No, your shirt won't turn green like your old pennies).\n2. The copper ions directly interact with the outer surface of the microbe's bacterial membrane, which causes the membrane to rupture.\n3. Once the bacterial membrane ruptures, the cell loses vital nutrients and water, which causes the microbe to weaken. This thwarts the ability for the bacteria to mutate and reproduce, thus leaving the shirt 99% microbe-free.\nOur Quality Tests\nWe've gone as far as ENSURING they are as odor free as can be.

Most are too long, which leads to tangles and other headaches while others are simply too short. Our CONNEX\u2122-cable boldly responds to this problem with the size of a credit card and effortlessly connects your digital devices for transferring data and charging. This new solution will eliminate the current annoyances of your tangling and bulky wire cables and those extra short length cables.\nData Transfer (Phone, Tablet, Camera, Speaker, Navigation Device, Laptop, Mac, PC, etc.) \nDevice Charging (Phone, Tablet, Camera, Power Bank, Speaker, etc) \nMitigating Hassles (Tangles, Irritations, Frustrations, and so on)\nTraditional charging and data cables are about 3 feet 5 inches (3'5\"), which can cause you inconveniences that are just unnecessary. A cable of this length is prone to easy tangling with other cables like your earphones and peripheral\u2019s cords. This can cause one big tangling mess!\nThanks to the Ultra-Durable Silicone's elasticity and physical strength, the cable immediately returns to its original form!\nWe offer both an Apple Lightning Connector version for all Apple product connectivity; iMac, MacBook, iPhone, iPad, iPod AND a Micro USB connector version for most Android devices and PC.\nThe CONNEX\u2122-cable is the most creative universal cable providing an easy compact tangle-free solution that you can personalize. You can draw and put other forms of art on the cable. It's a great fun way to express yourself! Enhance with a logo or your own design! It is a fun way to have it filled with doodle, sketches and other flights of ink-filled fancy.\nThere is a wide array of colors to suit your preferences and match all of your devices. This is ultimate convenience with style.\nEach product will be individually packaged for the proper protection.\nNo more worries about tangling cables! Its slim and small form-factor will fit in the smallest of places nicely like your wallet, trouser pocket, and anywhere else you want to carry it around in. It is a truly small and nifty!\nIt Fits!\nIt hangs!\n  ...and it even holds your place in a book!\nIt Stretches!    \nIt can stretch for your convenience and gives you a great deal of flexibility to connect devices within 18 inches, at any angle and even those awkward uneven surfaces. This product works with you, not against you!\nIt Connects!   \nThis cable is all about the connectivity between digital devices with USB-A and Micro USB OR USB-A and Lightning Connector.\nAmazing Experience \nSometimes, conventional cables are too long and inconvenient to use on the move, where as some short length cables are just that little bit too short! This leaves you stuck on the middle with no real solution! Most stick type short length charging cables require extra effort to get an equal port level, facing angle and so on. With the CONNEX\u2122-cable, you won\u2019t experience these common issues for much longer \u2013 Easy use and no tangling gives you a much greater experience. This is a truly simple solution to an irritating problem most of us face each day!\nMost stick type (a.k.a Key chain) short length charging cables are limited to connecting devices at a distance and uneven port levels OR to charge devices from the wall outlet.\nThoughtful Design \nThis cable was not only designed small and slim, but also performs the best for great stretch and complete collapse. Through our series of studies, we found a unique cutting pattern that gives us the best result for performance. We designed it with complete space efficiency in mind. The space for the cable and connector over mold has been precisely allocated for the entire volume to mitigate the total area.\n\nAlong with its elasticity and physical strength, our design solution also helps it to prevent rips and tears.\nSuperb Material\nCONNEX\u2122-cable is made of Ultra-Durable Synthetic Silicone for great stretch and perfect collapse. Flexible to your every need!\nSilicone exhibits many useful characteristics, including: \nHigh tensile strength \nLow thermal conductivity \nLow chemical reactivity \nLow toxicity Thermal stability (constancy of properties over a wide temperature range of \u2212100 to 250 \u00b0C). \nThe ability to repel water \nDoes not stick to many substrates, but adheres very well to others, e.g. glass. \nDoes not support microbiological growth. \nElectrical insulation properties. Because silicone can be formulated to be electrically insulative or conductive, it is suitable for a wide range of electrical applications. \n[SOURCE from: Hans-Heinrich Moretto, Manfred Schulze, Gebhard Wagner (2005) \"Silicones\" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim.]  \nTech Spec  \nWeight: 15g(Product) / 55g+/-(Packaged weight) \nDimension: 86mm(3.4inch) X 54mm(2.1inch) X 3.5mm(0.14inch) \nCable Length: 18inch(Recommended) / 20inch(Max) \nMaterials of Cable: Ultra-Durable Synthetic Silicone \nPackage Condition: Individually Packaged within Clear PET Blister for Maximum Visibility\n* If one of the tiers doesn't fit your needs, we're happy to customize your orders of 20 or more.

However, there is a part of Yellowstone that very few people have visited. An entire ecosystem that is hidden from us at the surface. A place that scientists are eager to study and may harbor unknown life; the depths of Yellowstone Lake.\nWe now know that the bottom of the Lake is far from barren, hosting species of crustaceans, sponges, and even small creatures that feed off of the Earth\u2019s heat and chemistry rather than the Sun. \u2018Thermophilic\u2019 (or hot water-loving) microbes thrive in the relatively high-temperatures immediately surrounding active thermal features at the bottom of the Lake and scattered throughout Yellowstone Park. These creatures may be microscopic but they have the potential to profoundly influence the medical and biological sciences.\nAn artist's visualization of the new Yellowstone robot \"Yogi\" sampling a thermal feature at the bottom of the Lake. Artwork by Michelle Anderst.\nThe study of one particular microbial species found in the backcountry of the Park in the 1970\u2019s, Thermus aquaticus (Taq), led to the development of the Nobel prize-winning method used to decode DNA and opened the floodgates to modern molecular biology. Researchers believe that because these organisms live in temperatures comparable to those inside the human body, analysis of their metabolic and physiological processes could to lead us to more effective treatments for cancer and other devastating human diseases. NASA scientists have also suggested that these thermal environments, and the unique lifeforms they support, might hold clues to the origin of life on this planet and possibly elsewhere in the universe.\nIt is estimated that less than 1% of Yellowstone's microbes have been identified so far and it\u2019s hard to predict what might be learned from those that have yet to be discovered. Many of these unknown species could be at the bottom of Yellowstone Lake right now, but the National Park Service does not have the tools needed to thoroughly characterize the Lake\u2019s deep water ecosystem on their own.\nWith your help we plan to support the National Park Service by building and operating \"Yogi\" the Robot, which will be capable of gathering the data they need to more thoroughly understand this unique ecosystem. It is now more feasible and cost-effective to develop a high-quality robotic platform than ever before and it\u2019s finally time to take exploration in Yellowstone Lake to the next level.\nSoutheast arm of Yellowstone Lake. Image courtesy of Yellowstone National Park.\nWho is the Global Foundation for Ocean Exploration?\nThe Global Foundation for Ocean Exploration (GFOE) is a non-profit engineering organization dedicated to empowering the global science community with robotic tools to explore the world\u2019s oceans and large lakes. GFOE is made up of engineers and explorers who design and operate vehicles used to study the bottom of the ocean and who now plan to build a robot to explore the largely unknown depths of Yellowstone Lake. With the launch of this Kickstarter campaign to build \"Yogi\" the Robot, we are pioneering a new way to fund underwater exploration--crowdfunding directly through the public, to produce high-definition underwater video and scientific data for the benefit and enjoyment of everyone.\nOur President and mentor, Dave Lovalvo, has been exploring the oceans and large lakes of the world with remotely operated vehicles (ROV\u2019s) for over 30 years. In 1985, he had the opportunity to bring the first robotic technology into Yellowstone Lake as an extension of his previous work with underwater vehicles. He partnered with scientists who were interested in studying hydrothermal activity in the Lake at depths greater than what was possible with standard diving techniques. Dave designed the mechanical components, coded the software, and tested and operated this robot himself. This was at a time when ROV\u2019s were an emerging technology and not widely used.\nThe original Yellowstone Robot, circa 1985. Image courtesy of Bob Landis.\nDave (right) preparing to launch the vehicle. Image courtesy of Bob Landis.\nDave\u2019s novel underwater vehicle was able to capture truly stunning video even with the relatively low-resolution cameras available in the early 1980\u2019s. For the first time, humans were able to see the towering rock formations, sweeping plains, and colorful thermal vents at the bottom of the Lake. Dave and the scientists had discovered what is a complex ecosystem riddled with hydrothermal features as impressive as the geysers that have made Yellowstone so iconic. More than 30 years later, only one other person has gone back into the Lake with robotic technology to help characterize the unique features at its bottom.\nUnique rock formations at the bottom of Yellowstone Lake, as imaged by the original Yellowstone Robot.\nThe shadow of a towering rock formation looms in the background, as imaged by the original Yellowstone Robot.\nA school of fish swimming in Yellowstone Lake, as imaged by the original Yellowstone Robot.\nWe no longer need to rely on one young engineer to design, build, and operate this kind of vehicle on their own. Dave has assembled a team of the brightest young minds in the industry and united them through our non-profit organization. The GFOE team already has experience building and operating underwater robots that explore deep ocean environments in some of the most remote places on Earth through a partnership with NOAA\u2019s Office of Ocean Exploration and Research. Our engineers have successfully managed over 150 ROV dives at depths of up to 3.7 miles, providing ocean scientists with insight into some of the most inaccessible ecosystems on the planet. They have proven themselves to have the professionalism, talent, and determination to continue what Dave started and carry exploration in Yellowstone Lake through the next 30 years.\nAs such, we are well positioned to build a next-generation robot designed by a new generation of engineers and create the capability for scientists in Yellowstone to make what could be some of tomorrow\u2019s greatest discoveries.\nThe Global Foundation for Ocean Exploration team in front of the ocean-based Deep Discoverer ROV.\nYellowstone National Park and the Yellowstone Association have offered to provide guidance on the research priorities and on the education and outreach components of the work done by this new robotic platform. Other groups such as the highly-respected Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI), Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, U.S. Geological Survey, Oregon State University, University of Minnesota, and Montana State University will make important contributions in guiding some of the science that will be supported by the robot in the years to come.\nWhy use crowdfunding for this project?\nThe cost of this kind of vehicle depends largely on its capabilities but they typically cost hundreds of thousands of dollars to build. However, MBARI has provided us with basic mechanical schematics and control software for \"Yogi\", GFOE engineers have already invested the time to adapt the design, and several major components have been privately donated to the project. One of these private donors has even offered a 1:1 match on any funds raised through Kickstarter, up to $100,000. This means that your donation will effectively be doubled. We have many of the important pieces in place but we need at least $100,000 in public support to raise the $200,000 required to actually build \"Yogi\" and move the project forward.\nHere is a summary of how GFOE hopes to use funds raised through Kickstarter, including the 1:1 match:\nHD Camera: $30,000\nRobotic Arm: $40,000\nThrusters: $45,000\nBuoyancy Foam Pack: $15,000\nNavigation Equipment: $20,000\nSensors: $25,000\nTether System: $15,000\nStructural Components: $10,000\nA photorealistic 3D model of \"Yogi\" the Robot.\n\"Yogi\" is designed to record high-definition video and enable scientists to collect delicate biological, geological, and chemical samples from thermal features at the bottom of the Lake. Some of its specifications include:\nDimensions: 3ft x 3ft x 4.5ft (the size of a clothes washer/dryer unit)\nWeight: 600lbs (scientific payload of up to 120lbs)\nDepth Rating: 4,920 feet (1500 meters)\nThrusters: 4 axial, 2 vertical\nMultiple high-definition cameras\n5-function electric manipulator for sample collection\nSuction sampler for sediment and biological material\nTemperature sensor\nWater sampler for collecting hydrothermal fluids\nChemical sensors for analyzing composition of hydrothermal fluids\n130-color sonar\nAcoustic navigation system\nExpandability for the addition of cameras and sensors in the future\nUnderwater vehicles of this kind typically have lifespans of 10-20 years which leaves ample opportunity down the road for this robot to explore other large lakes beyond Yellowstone. For now, we at the Global Foundation for Ocean Exploration hope to support scientists in a place that is cherished, provide valuable knowledge for future generations, and foster a growing community of young, passionate explorers.\nAnd, right now, you have the opportunity to help make this happen.\nSmoky sunset over Yellowstone Lake.

The clothing industry has struggled to reconcile fashion and technology. Technical clothing companies which have launched in the past years claim to be fashionable and innovative. However, to put it simply, none of them are, rather they created clothes for hiking and other outdoor specific purposes. Both technical clothing companies and fashion companies make compromises on:  \nElegance for comfort \nComfort for elegance \nDesign over fabric innovation \nFabric innovation over design \nThere is no harmonious balance. \nWe have conceptualised a new category of pants, whereas other brands simply combine chinos and technologies. The Chameleon pants meet any formal dress code and are still comfortable for a 12-hour flight. The unique fabric blend results in a perfect balance of comfort, durability and formality, making the Chameleon versatile.  \nShort product life cycle / Disposable Fashion Clothing has become something we can purchase every week and toss out every few months.  What that does to the culture of fashion is that we\u2019ve become less attached to each garment as a part of our identity. What we're seeing in the new era of fashion is backpedalling compared to the mindset 20 years earlier, where clothing had a deeper intrinsic value. We are here to change that!\n\nInspired by minimalism, functionalism, technology and contemporary culture, we set out to design a timeless and stylish everyday trouser.\nDESIGNED in Switzerland & Spain\nMade in Portugal\nTextile technologies from Switzerland\nSophisticated state of the art design (minimalist + elegant) \nErgonomic design, with more crotch room to breathe\nFashionable pleats \nA medium weight double knit jersey  \nComfortable 'silk-like' pockets, in elegant contrasting colours \nDouble reinforced crotch (No more crotch \"blow out\")  \nVelcro closure, (no beeping at airports) \nHigh quality zippers \nBelt loops (optional)\n\nMACHINE-WASHABLE\nNo pilling \nNo color degrading \nNo shrinking\nPANTHER CHAMELEON (Black)\nJACKSON'S CHAMELEON (Grey)\nPARSON'S CHAMELEON (Bordeaux)\nVEILED CHAMELEON (Blue)\nSame design specs.

Clothing which strives for perfection in terms of minimalist aesthetics, functionality and technicality. We are reinventing clothing, to maximize the wearing experience and offer clothing worthy of our times. Our vision is to offer a large spectrum of products which can provide significant improvements to peoples\u2019 lives.  We promise to push the boundaries, continuously redefining existing clothing concepts. Fashion can no longer ignore technology. \nWe are based out of our office in Zurich, Switzerland, however all frequently travel and explore the world. Mamquam was founded by Batis and Philip in January 2015, two Swiss high school friends, who then recruited our creative director, Martin Maldonado aka Martin Across.  \nConcepts which challenge and allow society to evolve have influenced Martin to express his ideas through drawing and illustration. \"I want people not to be guided by how to look, but rather how they would feel, and whom they would transform into, by wearing a piece of clothing\".\nWe are all university students and recent graduates, changing the way we think and dress.

You know why, but let's refresh your memory...\nThese are just some of the problems with normal suit buttons:\n- They're always the same.\n- They're always plain and have nothing personal to them.\n- If your jacket is too tight on you or doesn't close at all you have to remove the button and sew it closer to the edge of the jacket\n- They get lost or broken at the cleaners.\n- There's no possibility of changing them unless you want to spend more than $15 - $20 to get them changed by a tailor. Then, you're back to square one when you get used to those newly-fixed buttons.\n- They break. Bringing you to the tailor, again.\nThat's why we created Cufftore.\nAll of these problems are fixed with our magnetic Cufftore buttons which easily permits you to change around your buttons between suits.\nBy backing our Kickstarter you'll be able to make your suit look custom made and always add a fresh look to it.\nThe Cufftore (which means \"button\", in Hebrew) design features a redesigned and reimagined suit button with a groove on the inside. We literally had to recreate the standard button, from the bottom up. Our design permits us to place a super-strong neodymium magnet in the center of the button.\nEvery button comes with a pin tie tack which has a magnetic base, permitting you to slip the pin through your suit and allow the buttons to magnetically connect to your suit.\nFurthermore, Cufftore magnetic buttons come pre-sewn with the color thread of your choice. Take that ugly thread!\nThe magnetic buttons could be as close as you want. They can be:\n1) \"Kissing, non stacked\", which means that they don't overlap, however they touch one another when placed on your suit.\n2) \"Kissing, stacked\" which means that they overlap and that they touch one another when placed on your suit.\n3) \"Non-kissing\", which means that they don't touch each other at all.\nTo the right - old, plain, junky buttons, and to the left - fresh, awesome-looking, amazing quality buttons ;)\nWe've also recreated the jacket button. We've set a groove on the back side of the jacket button, enabling us to place a pin tie tack on the inside of it.\nOh, and did we forget to mention that Cufftore is Patent-Pending?\nSwitch it up whenever you like! Surprise us with your combos!\nThere are so many different combinations for Cufftore buttons. We can't wait to see what kinds of ideas you guys have in store!\nThis is for any man or woman who owns a suit. That means that whether you're trying to look preppy or classy, sassy or fancy, this is for you.\nWe've partnered with Original Standard Button which is one of the leading button wholesalers in Canada, and which manufacturers all of the buttons in Spain. Original Standard Button has been in the business for over 30 years while the manufacturer has been in the business for over 60 years and has specialized in custom button orders. A job like this is like a walk in the park for them. They have reassured us about scheduled timing. They're really awesome.\nWhat you'll receive:\nEvery backer that pledges $35 ($25 for super-early birds!) or more will receive:\n8 Cufftore Magnetic Buttons (4 for each side cuff), with your choice of color button and thread \n8 Magnetic Clutch Bases (as a base for you buttons)\n3 Interchangeable Jacket Buttons\n1 Thread Cutter\n                 Add-ons:\nIf you'd like to order more buttons (8 buttons without the magnetic pin and 3 jacket buttons) then just add $20 (per set of extra buttons that you'd like) to your pledge and send us a message to let us know. Condition: You must have pledged more than $25. Shipping will be taken care of by pledge of $25 or more.\nIf you'd like to order 3 more jacket buttons for a double-breasted suit then add $6 to your already-existing pledge. Condition: You must have pledged more than $25. Shipping will be taken care of by pledge of $25 or more.\nBy backing us you'll be able to choose from one of the following 4 beautiful colours offered: (a survey will be sent out at the end of the campaign for you to let us know which colour buttons you have chosen.)\nCoffee Brown | Left: Cuff Button | Right: Jacket Button\nCobalt Blue | Left: Cuff Button | Right: Jacket Button\nCamel | Left: Cuff Button | Right: Jacket Button\nCharcoal | Left: Cuff Button | Right: Jacket Button\nYou'll also be able to choose the colour thread you'd like your buttons to come with. There are 5 colour choices to choose from: \nCrimson\nPowder Pink \nSky Blue\nCitrine Yellow\nClassic Black\nEvery set of Cufftore magnetic buttons will come with 3 Cufftore interchangeable jacket buttons. The jacket buttons are sewn (with the corresponding color of your choice from the 5 available colors above) and are attached to a pin tie tack and clutch, enabling you to be able to switch around to a different button whenever you'd like, while being very tightly fastened to your suit, just like a normal jacket button.\nAnd let's not forget a very important advantage:\nYup, that's another advantage. We know, we're awesome.\n3 easy steps that only need to be done once:\n1) Easily remove the old buttons from the suit with the special thread cutter included with the Cufftore buttons\n2) Insert the magnetic pin into the suit and lock it in place with the clutch\n3) Place the desired buttons\n You now look like a boss ;)\nWe tried magnets in all types of different sizes and thicknesses... (they're super strong btw!)\nWe even tried using steel discs...\n\nAfter more than 6 months of testing, we're here to tell you that cufftore is discreet :)\nBecause Cufftore buttons are such amazing quality, each set of buttons comes with a lifetime warranty for the buyer.\n *Please note that this covers manufacturing problems such as the thread unraveling, the magnet disconnecting from the button for some reason, or the back butterfly pin/clutch breaking. Buyer takes care of shipping costs and the rest will be done free of charge. Proof of purchase is needed.*\nOur number one customer satisfaction goal is to make sure that our magnetic buttons surpass the standard. That's why we have made sure to choose top-quality material to create Cufftore. The buttons are made of high quality polyester and by the end of production finish-off with a glossy finish. Not only do our buttons look and feel like good quality, they really are amazing pieces of work.\nTo insure this quality aspect, we have pushed for the buttons to be created in Spain, and nowhere else.\nWe have a few Stretch Goal ideas in mind and they'll be released as soon as possible! Don't worry, you'll love 'em.\nNot only do we care about your style, but we also care about those that are less fortunate. With that said, a minimum of 10% of all profits will be given to charitable organizations around the world.\nWebsite: Cufftore.com\nAmerican Friends! Take note that all prices are in Canadian Dollars which means it's cheaper for you! :D We got your back lol.\nThis is the look you'll have on your face when you receive your buttons btw :P\nPlease note that you may be responsible for duties, fees and taxes applicable to your Cities/Country.

We\u2019ve went through all the prototypes, searched for the best material, did countless tests, and are completely ready for production. We\u2019ve partnered with a very well-known custom button manufacturer in Spain which has been manufacturing buttons for the last 60 years and have done custom button orders daily. This is why we\u2019re able to ship you your rewards in under 60 days. We\u2019re just that awesome. :)\n\nThere\u2019s one challenge that we see ourselves possibly getting into. Because Cufftore buttons are created from multiple materials (buttons, magnets, thread, etc..) and requires different labour jobs (manufacturing, threading, gluing etc\u2026), we find that there might be a risk for scheduling between the different jobs needed for the product. However, because we have set ourselves specific dates for production and have organized ourselves beforehand with all necessary workers and contractors, we believe that the possibility of this risk is almost at a zero percent chance of happening. In the very slight possibility that this does happen however, we will be on top of it, access other workers and contractors to get the work done quicker, give you updates along the way and push ourselves as hard as we can in order for there to not be any set-backs.

Presentation to a surly manager. Gunfire from villainous henchmen. One of those days.\nYour body sweats to keep you cool in tense situations. In fact, your feet have one of the highest concentrations of sweat glands on your body, and are confined in stifling boxes called shoes most of the day. This is not a recipe for feeling (or smelling) like success.\nInspired by the archetypal super-spy, we\u2019ve created the perfect sock to keep you looking and feeling effortlessly cool, whether stress means spreadsheets or shootouts. Through the design process, we\u2019ve tested every product on the market and made dozens of prototypes to reach the perfect blend of features and capabilities. Like an ejection-seat-equipped sports car, the Stealth Sock\u2019s stylishly unassuming exterior conceals the incredible technology and features that make it so awesome.\nThe secret weapon behind the Stealth Sock is its unique one-two punch of fabric technologies. The first of its kind, bacteriostatic silver and activated carbon infused fibers work synergistically to keep you cool and odorless. Paired with its advanced construction methods and features, there\u2019s no better sock on the market.\nLike the agents it's designed for, the Stealth Sock can go anywhere and do anything. Sleek and svelte, it's thin enough to fit perfectly under a handcrafted leather dress shoe, yet its ample cushioning and performance features make it equally at home under boots on the trail or sneakers and jeans off-duty.\nNew to the Stealth Sock family are the Recon & Zero. Just in time for the campaign's end, these unlocked stretch goals provide the technological punch of the Stealth Sock in more casual or beach-appropriate cuts.\nTrue to its name, the Stealth Sock features an unmatched ability to remain undetectably fresh, even after multiple wears and heavy use. How is that possible? Well:\nStealth Sock silver fabric works by keeping bacteria, the real odor culprits, in check at healthy skin levels; without it, they grow uncontrollably leading to that locker-room smell.\nSo go ahead, wear 'em again if the situation calls for it. Pack a little lighter for that trip. We won't tell - and nobody else can.\nLike your favorite gym gear, Stealth Socks fight rising temps by transporting moisture away from your skin while improving air circulation and breathability.\nTo prove the Stealth Sock\u2019s performance, we had samples tested at a 3rd party laboratory certified by the American Association of Textile Chemists and Colorists.\nIn addition to keeping feet dry and breathable, the Stealth Sock features strategically placed cushioning and a seamless toe for maximum comfort and wearability.\nStylish clothes are worthless without proper fit, and state-of-the-art socks are useless if you spend half your time pulling at and adjusting them. By pairing our unique fiber blend with top of the line fit features, you can be confident that your Stealth Socks will always stay in place and never let you down.\nSelf-adjusting cuff conforms to your calf\nThe Stealth Sock's unique fiber blend give it a higher degree of stretch and adaptability than most other products. As a result, it fits comfortably on feet from US Men\u2019s 5/Women\u2019s 6 to Men\u2019s 14/Women\u2019s 15.\nLengthwise stretch\nSome brands have caught criticism for allowing silver to leach out of their clothes and onto their wearers. Unlike cheaper, coated threads, the Stealth Sock utilizes a polymeric matrix design to encapsulate the silver in its fibers. This means the odor-fighting ability is proven to stay in the sock and off your skin, all while ensuring antimicrobial effectiveness even after 100+ washes.\nWhen we were testing other socks on the market, nothing irritated us more than spending $30 on a pair with some cool technology, only for it to pill to shreds and disintegrate after only a few wears. We vowed never to make that mistake. Besides using a naturally more wear-resistant fabric, we added:\n               The Covert Travel Kit\nDesigned with versatility in mind, the Covert Travel Kit\u2019s zippered pockets and elastic straps make it the perfect case for carrying and organizing your gear in any situation. Built out of heavy-duty nylon, toss it into your suitcase for your next trip or use the integrated webbing system to strap it into a bag or pack.\n Load outs might include:\nToiletries, shaving gear, and documents for travel\nFirst aid items, tools, and a flashlight to keep in the car\nHard drive, cables, and a mouse for work on the go\nPocketknife, chargers, and pens for EDC\nSurvival tools and emergency supplies for camping\nThe Deodorizer\nBuilt with the same charcoal carbon technology, the Deodorizer is a natural companion to our Stealth Socks. Coming in a two pack, the Deodorizer captures odor with a slim and convenient form factor, perfect for slipping into shoes, gym bags, suitcases, or anywhere else odors or humidity aren't welcome.\n\nCustomize Your Loadout\nAdditional deodorizers, travel kits, and Stealth Socks available as add-ons via backer survey at the end of the campaign.\n            Meet the founders: Gabby, Ben, and Kevin\nMaison Impeccable was founded in early 2015 by a few high school friends from Michigan reuniting from coast to coast through a shared passion for style and a love of action flicks. Our team spans a diverse range of industries and experiences: business, medicine, retail, tech, and even finance - all of which help to give us unique insights and perspectives into the clothes we wear and how we can improve them.\nDespite differing backgrounds, we all independently ended up at the same conclusion: today\u2019s clothes simply aren\u2019t as good as they should be, always forcing us to sacrifice on one aspect or another. We\u2019re not the first to come up with this idea either - a handful of other brands are paving the way and doing great work. That said, when we tried what was on the market, something always wasn\u2019t quite right. Sure, A was great, but B was all wrong. Why didn\u2019t they do C and had they even considered D? Rather than wait for companies to magically figure out and produce what we wanted, we decided strike out on our own. We were already reading and learning about this stuff obsessively in our free time, why not make something of it?\nThe Support Team\nAs much work as we've put in over the past year and change, we wouldn't be where we are today without all the people who've helped us along the way. Among others, we'd like to thank:\nMaison Impeccable is a startup dedicated to evolving garments and how we interact with them. By analyzing clothing equally through the lenses of utility and aesthetics, we seek to engineer pieces that offer uncompromising performance across all use cases. Building upon the belief that each individual is the hero of their own life, our goal is to keep wearers outfitted for the day\u2019s missions, wherever they may lead.\nAs the common Kickstarter story goes, the traditional model of buy-first-sell-later manufacturing is too expensive for new brands just getting started.\nTo make Stealth Socks, we need to make a minimum order from our factory of several thousand pairs - after all, it doesn\u2019t make sense for them to set up and retool machines to make a few dozen socks. Crowdfunding on Kickstarter lets us secure enough initial orders to make a large production run so we can bring costs and prices down to reasonable levels. Without you, we\u2019d have to either make a small order with a crazy-high cost, or keep thousands of pairs sitting around in a warehouse as we find buyers one-by-one.\nFunding raised through the campaign will go towards production, manufacturing, and shipping the Stealth Sock as well as fuel the development of awesome new product lines in the future!\nAll orders will be shipped from our fulfillment warehouse in Georgia. We evaluated dozens of companies for reputation, reliability, and experience before choosing this critical partner. We're proud to offer free shipping within the United States for all Kickstarter backers.\nFor operatives outside of the US, shipping will add a small fee to cover added costs. Taxes, VAT and/or duties aren\u2019t included in the prices and may be added in accordance with your local regulations.\nBecause policies around customs and duties can vary by country, please check yours in advance to avoid any complications down the line!\n  For any press enquiries, please contact press@impeccable.maison", "risks": "Risks and challenges\n\u201cWhat\u2019s life without a little risk?\u201d\n\nWords to live by, maybe not what you look for in your Kickstarter projects. When the Stealth Sock is successfully funded, we will do everything in our power to ensure we meet our timeline. We\u2019ve spent thousands of hours working to develop and sync manufacturing, packaging, and logistics to be ready to hit the ground running as soon as our timer hits zero. With dozens of samples crafted and delivered to friends, media, and testers around the world, all elements of our supply chain have been tested and tuned. We will deliver.\n\nThe most likely risks have to do with timing: machine time for production, logistics time across the ocean, and fulfillment time to get into your hands. We\u2019re keeping our partners in those fields ready and will continue to do so throughout the campaign so we should be ready to go.\n\nBeyond that, we don\u2019t see any direct risks or challenges, but the path to get here frequently reminded us that life always has a few surprises in store.

These inconveniences are something that we\u2019ve all dealt with, and this led us to create the ultimate towel. \nWe couldn\u2019t make any compromises and met each of the following goals: \nBeach towel size\nDries 3x quicker than cotton\nAbsorbs 3x its weight\nSoft & Durable\nAnti-bacterial to eliminate odors\nSuper compact with integrated elastic band\nUltra lightweight\nUses less water to wash\nRecyclable\nInspired by our passion for travel, we created geometric patterns that represent our love for peaceful ocean waves, golden desert sunsets, and breathtaking summits.\nEfficient\nWhatever the situation may be, Acteon towels have you covered. Our microfiber towels dry 3x quicker than the average cotton towel. Microfiber has this ability because it is made with ultra-thin strands that are 10 times thinner than a human hair. Additional benefits of microfiber are that it is super soft, incredibly durable, and uses less water to wash.\nAnti-bacterial\nActeon towels are designed to stay fresh even after repeated use. Our towels are treated with silver antimicrobial ions that prevent the growth of bacteria. By prohibiting the growth of bacteria, Acteon towels will maintain their color and remain odor-free. Microfiber adds to this effect because it has natural antibacterial properties that trap less dirt as it dries.\nCompact\nSpace is always a premium whether you\u2019re traveling abroad to an exotic destination, or to the local beach. Acteon towels fold easily and quickly into a compact size that is 3x smaller than your average cotton beach towel. Each towel is marked with integrated stitches to guide folding. Once folded, the towel is bound with an elastic band to snuggly keep it in place. The tag attached to the band can be used with a carabiner to connect to a pack while rolled or use it to hang dry. Aside from consuming minimal space, Acteon towels only weigh 8.7 ounces.\nThe tag can be used as a hanging loop for faster drying ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nBringing a product from the drawing board to reality is not an easy task.

Their craftsmanship is deeply rooted in tradition and they have been thriving for four generations. Together, we created an attainable, handcrafted, ultra-luxury dress shoe that comes packed with features and is designed for comfort. Their traditional construction is combined with our innovative design and bold attitude. Ace Marks shoes are built for the modern gentleman. Help us make our first production!\nWhether you\u2019re heading a startup or running a Fortune 500 company, Ace Marks shoes make a bold, powerful statement.\nAce Marks is the first and only luxury brand that will buy back its shoes. Kickstarter supporters will be able to send back their old Ace Marks for a $60 credit towards a new full priced pair purchased from our website. We partnered with Career Gear, a leading national organization helping men in need, to donate your old shoes and help men get back on their feet and re-enter the work force. The latest details regarding this program can be found at www.acemarks.com.\nThe Vincent is a versatile dress shoe that can be worn for your Monday morning meeting or a casual night out and anything in-between. Decorative perforation and broguing details preserve tradition, while contrasting leathers stake new style ground. These wingtips strike the perfect balance between traditional and modern.\nThe Griffin can adapt to your mood and will never let you down. The usually reserved cap-toe oxford takes a bold step forward with understated color blocking and polished pairings of leather and suede.\nThe Brody goes just great with a suit or paired with khakis or jeans. Rendered in richly oiled leathers and furnished with a traditional apron toe, the Brody fuses a classic preppy style with modern elegance.\nThe Logan\u2019s contrast of materials and tones gives these lace-ups a powerful, authoritative look, but it's the broguing that sets this stylish boot apart. The rubber outsole adds a level of toughness, to a very commanding appearance.\nEach pair of Ace Marks dress shoes is made with full grain calf leather and is crafted, dyed, and burnished by hand. The manual process gives each pair its unique characteristics. Each pair goes through a rigorous inspection to ensure that every shoe is of the highest quality.\nOur manufacturing process is done completely in-house. Each shoe takes great precision and skill to ensure the outcome is impeccable. \nBecoming one of our backers means much more than just buying a world class shoe at an amazing price.

No crazy markup. Just magnificent shoes at a magnificent price that we will buy back when you're ready for a new pair.\nOur disruptive business model goes beyond cutting out the middle man to give our supporters direct to consumer pricing.\nWe created the Leave Your Marks program to activate the Ace Marks family and incentivize giving back. By sending back your worn Ace Marks Italian Luxury Statement shoes every time you buy a new full priced Italian luxury Statement shoe from www.acemarks.com, you, our Kickstarter supporters, not only get a $60 credit and a great reason to keep your shoe game fresh, you also participate in changing someone's life. \nTo make sure that our shoe donations are put to good use, we partnered with Career Gear to donate them to help men in need enter the workforce, stay employed and become role models and mentors to their families and communities.\nAce Marks is the first and only luxury shoe company to do this!\nWe're excited to see how many men we can help get back on their feet! Get the latest details about this program at www.acemarks.com.\nWhen it comes to luxury, no matter how good your shoe looks, comfort is just as important. Ace Marks shoes are bold, flexible, and light. \nWe spent 3 years in development to make sure that we get it right, and we spared no expense. Each pair is superbly handcrafted, hand burnished, and packed with features.   \nThat's why Ace Marks shoes:\nAre made from hand-selected full-grain leather.  \nUse a lightweight Blake Flex construction and leather outsole that allows for easy, effortless movement. \nReduce common pressure points around the heel and mid-foot with a carefully constructed last (a.k.a. forma). \nRelieve stress as you walk with a cushioned leather insole, which molds to your foot over time for added comfort. \nAre lined with supple calfskin to keep your feet dry and cool. \n\n\nAce Marks was designed for the modern gentleman looking to step up his style and add a bit of swagger.

By cutting out the middlemen, we\u2019re able to deliver the highest quality product at a market disruptive price. Luxury doesn't have to cost a small fortune.\nAce Marks shoes are statement shoes. They are well-made, attractive and eye-catching shoes that reflects your personality\nOur designs are modern classics in unique color and material combinations, and packed with features\nAce Marks is for the modern gentleman that appreciates craftsmanship and style.\nAce Marks Shoes are available from size 5 to 14, including half sizes. They are a \"D\", medium/standard width. We cut them generously around the midfoot and heel to prevent unnecessary pressure on the foot.\nOur shoes fit true to US sizing. Still, it will be VERY important that you follow our fitting & sizing instructions that you will receive once the campaign has ended. The survey where you choose your style, color, and size will include instructions on how to measure your foot to assure the best fit. If the size you order happens to not be the best fit, we will exchange it for you (please see DELIVERY section below for shipping charges on exchanges).\nWe look forward to adding widths and larger sizes in the future. We are here for YOU!\nOur team is ambitious. We know that we made a world class luxury dress shoe, full of features you will love. As we reach our funding goals, we want to give you more products and more choices. \nWe have more styles and accessories waiting to be unlocked!\nOur stretch goals are the beginnings of more luxury footwear choices for you. Help us reach our stretch goals so that we can show you how much more there is to Ace Marks!\nOnce the campaign is funded, we expect that it will take 2-3 weeks for us to send the survey and receive back the style, color, and size surveys from all backers. The faster we get them back the less likely any delays!\nProduction typically takes 8 weeks, and shipping approximately 3 weeks.\nBy the end of July 2016, or sooner, we expect to be shipping to you from our facility in Miami, FL.\nWe are very experienced in delivering shoes on time! We will do everything in our power to make sure we meet the timeline. \nWe will make sure that you get what you ordered and on time.\nShipping is included for all shipments in the continental United States. \nHowever, if the need for an exchange arises, we will need to charge for the exchange shipping both ways as we are a startup and work with very small margins on Kickstarter. This is true for domestic & international orders. \nThe cost of international duties and shipping will depend on the destination.\nContinental US & Canadian orders will ship from our facility in Miami, FL. \nAll other orders will ship from our fulfillment center in the EU. Orders shipped within the EU will not incur customs duty charges, but will be subject to VAT. \nExpected international shipping rates, including Canada, can be found here. The cost of international shipping & VAT (if applicable) will be charged at the time of the survey once the campaign is over. \nIf applicable, duties and local taxes will be charged by the appropriate authority at the destination country. Please determine these charges locally.\nAce Marks wasn't created on a whim. It is the product of a lifetime of research and experience in the luxury footwear business.\nOur founder, Paul, grew up traveling with his parents to Italy & Spain's shoe factories. Formally educated in International Finance & Marketing at the University of Miami, he and his brother Daniel, as their parents before them, have dedicated their lives to designing and producing luxury footwear of the highest quality. Their footwear experience ranges from designing & manufacturing to marketing, warehousing and logistics. They have done it all.\nTo assure that our supporters receive top notch service, we put together a team with extensive experience in footwear logistics and distribution. For three years, our team has prepared for the launch of Ace Marks, and we are excited to share our product and vision with the world!\nQuality. We spent a lot of time finding the best artisans in Italy that have the materials, the facilities, the pedigree and, most importantly, the experience to create a world-class luxury shoe. We spared no expense to make sure that you will get only the best.\nAffordability. By implementing a disruptive business model that delivers your shoes straight from the artisan's hands to your doorsteps, we eliminate the need for retailers, wholesalers, and other middlemen. The workmanship and luxury you will experience with our shoes is incomparable, at a price that is unparalleled. Less than $200 for a $600-$1,000+ shoe. We did it for YOU.\nCommunication. Your commitment to us is the start of a long, beautiful relationship. We are committed to you. We will keep our relationship strong by delivering amazing products and communicate with you every step of the way. You will get regular updates as we fund, produce, and ship out your one-of-a-kind shoes. If you have an itch to talk to us, just get in touch any time!  \nConsistency. Every Ace Marks shoe is hand crafted and hand dyed, meaning that no two pairs are identical. However, each pair goes through a thorough inspection process to assure the quality you expect from a world-class luxury brand.\nExperience & Reliability. Ace Marks was founded by a team with a lifetime of experience in the luxury footwear industry. We don't make commitments that we can't honor. We have the infrastructure to assure a smooth process from taking your order thru delivery.

The Ace Marks Family!\nDear Supporters, \nOver the last 3 years, we have poured our heart and soul into bringing Ace Marks to life. We have traveled over 35,000 miles by plane, train, and automobile and spent thousands of hours in factories, designing, developing prototypes, and generally planning how to make a luxury dress shoe that will make you look good and feel powerful every time you put them on. When you receive your first pair of Ace Marks shoes, it will be clear to you that we accomplished our goal. Now we just need you to help us get to the finish.\nFrom the start, it was also very important to us that Ace Marks makes a strong impact on our community. With so many men and women struggling to support their families, we want to do our part to help them overcome at least one of the obstacles that they are facing, which is to find meaningful employment. That is why we partnered with Career Gear and implemented our buy back program. We hope that our shoe donations will help thousands of men take their first steps into a brighter future.\nWith your help, we will grow Ace Marks into a luxury lifestyle brand driven by a commitment to fine craftsmanship, beautiful aesthetics, and your happiness. It is for you, that we will continue to innovate and create.\nThrough our journey, we have learned that Ace Marks is ultimately about empowerment.

Your pair of BASE insoles will closely follow your unique foot curves to give you the support and stability that you need to keep going. To customize your pair of insoles and get measured, all you need is 5 minutes and a smartphone. With this kind of convenience, you\u2019ll never want to go for off-the-shelf again.\nGetting your BASE insoles is easy. 2D images are taken through the Wiivv smartphone app to capture the unique contours of your feet. These images are verified by an expert and processed in Wiivv\u2019s blazing-fast customization engine to produce a 3D-printable file for a pair of insoles to perfectly fit you and you only. This unique file is then sent to enterprise-grade 3D printers that use SLS technology (a system of powerful and precise lasers) to build a durable and flexible shell. Finally, skilled workers use their crafting knowledge to deftly apply a beautifully designed top layer along with features to further improve comfort, like silicon treads and cushions.\nIn a kinematic analysis done by a 3rd party, BASE custom insoles were seen to significantly reduce joint loading in the knee and hip \u2013 which can translate to increased performance in endurance sports. They give you more control with every step you take and help spread the impact force of walking and running activities to areas best suited for absorption.\nOur specially designed heel cup delivers optimum stability, shock absorption and comfort. The \u201chole in the heel cup\u201d design was created in collaboration with pedorthic experts to reduce heel raise. Reduced heel raise is a key feature that allows users of BASE insoles to keep the built-in or removable insoles of their current footwear. The \u00be shell delivers biomechanical neutrality, lessens pressure on the forefoot, and offers better stability.\nThe first step to getting your BASE custom insoles is to download the Wiivv iOS app, where you will create your very own pair of custom, 3D printed insoles in 5 minutes or less. (Note: iPhone and iPod touch available now. iPad and Android will be available by the summer.) Inside the app, you\u2019ll have a wide range of artsy colours, designs and comfortable top sheets to choose from. Video walkthroughs will guide you through capturing two photos of each foot for the measurement step. That's all you'll need to do! No expensive consultations with your local foot specialist, and no need to try on dozens of flimsy insoles at the pharmacy. Wiivv makes true comfort accessible to you for only $75 (MSRP) per pair of custom insoles.\nFunction always comes first, but style matters too. We invested in the details of our product, from your name engraved on the bottom of your Wiivvs to the variety of beautifully designed top layers.\n4 base colors.\n8 top sheet patterns and colors.\nBelow is the actual package BASE insole backers will receive in the mail. Each one includes a custom pair of Wiivvs with the design options chosen inside the app, a usage guide, and a massage ball to relax your arch muscles.\nTo use the physical product, place it on top of your shoe\u2019s factory-installed insole, and push it back so it\u2019s nestled neatly in the heel area. For better positioning, we recommend that you be seated when inserting your feet.\nLed by Wiivv's own biomechanics team, BASE\u2019s development was done in partnership with experts in the fields of sports medicine and orthopaedics in the effort to create the ultimate custom insole. The team identified and improved on critical design features that affect insole comfort and effectiveness, such as the medial/lateral arch shape and offset, insole contour and thickness, shock absorbing heel pad, cushioning top layer, insole length and shape to maximize flexibility in 1st MPJ joint, and heel cup shape and depth.\nWe enlisted a group of 100 superheroes in our West Coast community to stress-test and fine-tune the product we bring to market. We put a specific focus on people who spend full days on their feet as part of their work - we call them \u201cthe industrial athletes\u201d. The group of people tested include fire-fighters, servers, nurses, and film industry veterans.\nBASE fills the wide gap in the product offerings available between a corrective orthotic and an off-the-shelf insole. Corrective orthotics are usually custom, but are costly. Off-the-shelf insoles have lower price points, but they do not fit your unique contours.\nWe want to create a meaningful stretch goal that will incent our backers to join us. If we reach $250,000, we vow to offer ALL of our backers a promo code for a $25 discount on a pair of BASE insoles after we have completed fulfilling our Kickstarter pairs. You can use this code for a second pair of insoles for another pair of shoes - or perhaps you will gift them to a friend. Those who buy multiple - will receive a code for every pair purchased. \nOur design process went through a year of R&D that resulted in 8 generations of feature sets and an astounding 72 product iterations. Having vigorously tested our product and the viability of our platform, we are unique in our ability to fulfill orders shortly after completing a successful Kickstarter campaign. The Wiivv platform is all about on-demand customization. Giving backers access to our product in record-time is just another application of that philosophy.\nWe have developed a suite of technologies that we call our \u2018Adaptive Manufacturing System\u2019. This system can be applied to make any device for the human body customizable with disruptive levels of convenience and affordability for the end user. The core component of the Adaptive Manufacturing System is our proprietary product customization engine. In seconds, the engine interprets data from the human body and spits out 3D print-ready files that are perfectly custom and optimized for biomechanics.\nBelow, you\u2019ll see one of Wiivv\u2019s printers manufacturing a batch of custom insoles. That\u2019s followed by the delicate separation and preparation of parts by our technicians before our skilled handworkers add the finishing touches.\n3D systems SLS Printers In Action\nWiivv is headquartered in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, and has an R&D and manufacturing facility in San Diego, California.\nWiivv was co-founded by Louis-Victor Jadavji and Shamil Hargovan in 2014 with the drive to make body-perfect gear, including custom insoles, accessible to the masses. Ben Wynne, a former HP Labs 3D technologist and Wiivv\u2019s Chief Technology Officer, leads a strong technical team that includes experts in biomechanics, mechatronics, mechanical, software, and computer vision engineering.\nThe team has been advised by industry leaders in biomechanics, additive technologies and lifestyle brands to help ensure that our product, platform and brand are built to last.\nIf you are still reading - we want to thank you for sharing in our vision.

That means they live in a low oxygen environment and these bacteria are killed by exposure to air.\nThe simple act of letting your toothbrush dry out between uses will kill many germs.\nFACT #3: SHARING A TOOTHBRUSH HOLDER IS THE SHORTEST WAY TO CROSS-CONTAMINATION\nIf you are sharing a toothbrush holder and one of the users is infected, it's highly possible for you to get sick soon.\nWhen you brush, you remove plaque and particles so toothbrushes can become contaminated with bacteria, blood, saliva, and oral debris. \nThis contamination can be passed right back to you or to others who share the same holder.\nIf more than one brush is stored in the same holder or area, keep the brushes separated to prevent cross-contamination.\nMake sure everyone has their own toothbrush by color-coding them.\nReplace your toothbrush regularly after you've had any illness such as a cold or flu because germs can remain even after you've recovered.\nIt's a good idea to replace your toothbrush after you've had any illness such as flu. \nFACT #4: TOOTHBRUSHES ARE EXPOSED TO MANY OTHER EXTERNAL THREATS\nBesides major toilet germs (E.Coli, streptococcus, S. aureus and more) and poop your toothbrush is exposed to many external threats. \nSomeone can accidentally touch your toothbrush bristles. \nAny insects that carry bacteria, viruses and parasites may contact your toothbrush and leave behind many types of germs that can threaten your health. \nDirty holders and other toothbrushes are other major threats.\n The same material used in antimicrobial surgical and dental trays.\nSilver is the active ingredient in Brushield's anti-microbial technology.\nSilver has been used for many centuries to prevent cell division, damage microbials and prevent the growth of bacteria, fungus and mold. \nBilateral air flow channels to inhibit the growth of germs\nAs American Dental Association indicates germs grow faster in moist and enclosed areas. Which means toothbrushes need to dry out after every use.\nBrushield allows your toothbrush to dry out by ventilation through its bilateral air flow channels to inhibit the growth of germs. \nWater evacuation holes which prevent the moisture by quickly removing the water\nAccording to the American Dental Association, again, you have to store your toothbrush in an upright position for a better dry out. \nThat's why we designed water evacuation holes at the bottom of our case, which prevents the moisture by quickly removing the water. \nBrushield prevents cross-contamination\nAmerican Dental Association recommends that, \"If more than one brush is stored in the same holder or area, keep the brushes separated to prevent cross-contamination.\" \nSharing a toothbrush holder could result in an exchange of body fluids and germs between the users of the toothbrushes, placing the individuals involved at an increased risk of infection. \nHowever, it is not easy to keep toothbrushes completely separate from others in a real household. Unless you use a Brushield.\nStrong magnetic locking system\nWtih Brushield's magnetic locking system your toothbrush is safe anytime, anywhere (travel bag, pocket, etc). \nIt does not unlock unexpectedly unless you want to take your toothbrush out of the case.\nBrushield is perfectly designed to keep you healthier while offering a fancy appearance. \nIt makes any toothbrush look more beautiful than it is. \nThe standart color of Brushield is Graphite Black - RAL9011. Color upgrade to any other color is $4 per each. For packages (pledges) that include three or more Brushields color upgrades are FREE. Brushield is compatible with more than 95% of the toothbrushes in the market due to its unique design. \nAll materials and pieces of Brushield are selected to make the cleaning process easier and safe. \nIn order to clean your Brushield we recommend washing your case with hot water first and then placing it in anti-bacterial mouthwash forat least 15 minutes. \nWe have designed a beautiful product that everyone would love to use. \nA product that should be used by every individual who wants to protect their health.\nHowever, we need your help to get this product manufactured. \nYour pledges will be used to supply materials and produce Brushield in the finest quality. \nFollow us on FACEBOOK and INSTAGRAM!\n* Anti-microbial protection does not protect against all disease-causing bacteria. Check ISO 22196/JISZ 2801:2000 test method for details. Anti-microbial protection has been tested against E. Coli and Staphylococcus aureus and the result was 99,99% neutralization of given bacteria. The method tests for both bacteriostatic (growth-inhibiting) and bactericidal (bacteria-killing) properties. The use of Brushield does not protect users against food-borne or disease-causing bacteria, viruses, germs or other disease-causing organisms.

Not sold seperately.\nThe Rumpl story originated in the outdoors around a roaring fire. Despite significant improvements in modern textiles over the years, we were unable to find a blanket that rivaled our outdoor gear in terms of performance, warmth, and durability. Even more frustrating was the blanket buying experience - home supply mega-stores with shelves full of boring, repetitive patterns encased in clear, plastic zipper bags. We felt that there was an opportunity to create homewear that was both stylish and high-performance. We tested our first product on Kickstarter and received overwhelming support, so we decided to go all-in and set up shop. We owe our entire existence to the Kickstarter community, and would not be here offering our second product without the support form our amazing customers.\nOur second offering, The Super Fleece Blanket, takes all that we've learned from our first product and applies the same rigor and attention to detail for which Rumpl has become known. The Super Fleece is a purpose-driven concept that we hope to bring to life with the support of the Kickstarter community. \nWe've got a big idea at Rumpl, and it's called Active Homewear\u2122.\nWhen looking at the fashion industry, the last decade has seen an explosion of performance fabrics. From yoga pants, to wicking tops, everyone is beginning to see the benefits of modern textiles for everyday use. Everyone, except the homegoods industry... We believe that the textiles used in your home should meet the same performance standards as those used for active and outdoor pursuits. We've taken material inspiration from major activewear brands and applied that knowledge to the blanket on your bed. The result is Active Homewear, and it's the perfect blend of performance and comfort that you need every single day.\nThe Rumpl team is made up of a group of designers who spend their free time outside. We draw inspiration from the gear we use in the outdoors that keeps us comfortable doing what we love. Since our first Kickstarter campaign in early 2014 our team has grown to a modest 4 full-timers that share a passion for design, outdoor experiences, and creating great products. Between the team, we've got over 40 years of experience creating high performance consumer goods out of advanced materials. Our operation gets more dialed each week, and we are excited to get our second product in your hands. \nCo-Founders Nick Polinko and Wylie Robinson\n                                                                                                                                    ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nSince our first Kickstarter campaign almost 2 years ago, Rumpl has grown up a lot. Now, we are a full-fledged brand that operates 365 days a year selling product to customers all over the world. We've got some great experience under our belts on how to manufacture high-quality goods and fulfill lots of orders on time. We've also been blindsided more than once by completely unexpected issues, and always dealt with them in a way that leaves every last customer happy with their purchase and proud to support our company.\n\nIn short, we know what we're doing, and you should be very confident that we will deliver what we say we will, when we say we will. And we solemnly swear that should unforeseen issues come up, we will handle them with the utmost transparency and care for you, our backers.\n\nForecasting Risk \nIf all goes well during our funding campaign, we'll finish up with a giant heap of preorders for our new products. Of course we're trying our hardest to predict our future demand and plan accordingly, but it's far from an exact science. While this ain't our first Kickstarter rodeo, our forecasting capabilities aren't the same as what you might expect from a big company.\n\nSupply Chain Risk \nAs Rumpl continues to mature we're getting better and better at managing our supply chain. For example, this year we set up two fully-operating parallel supply chains to shore up our ability to make quality products, at high volumes, on time. We've come a long way and are proud of how much we've improved. But it's safe to say that there is still some risk here. If a container shipment is delayed for 2 weeks in customs or a batch of new material doesn't pass QA testing, our fulfillment schedule\u2014even if padded\u2014can start to slip.\n\nActs of God \nWe're based in San Francisco.

We need it to see\u2014when in cars, when finding keyholes, even when we\u2019re outdoors. We have noticed that many everyday carry, or EDC, essentials are too dull, and current EDC flashlights are too big and bulky, so we set out to create our own.\nIt all started when I needed a flashlight one evening after I dropped my phone under my car. I immediately needed a light but did not have one. I thought to myself, \"It would be great to have a flashlight, but the size of a bullet.\"\nInspired by the 9mm round.\nA sleek, minimal, and beautiful design, we present to you BULLET, providing a strong LED mini flashlight in its most minimal form, while eliminating bulky flashlights from your everyday carry. Minimize your life. \nEveryday Carry Done Right\nWe believe that your everyday carry items are a reflection of you and your lifestyle. BULLET\u2019S functionality, beauty, and minimalism make it the best everyday carry tiny LED flashlight available. The easiest way to carry your flashlight is on your keys! Save the space in your pockets for what truly matters.  \nA quick quarter rotation on the head of the BULLET to turn it on, and a quick rotation back to turn it off. We wanted to get rid of unnecessary buttons to keep it slick and precise. A built in key chain allows you to carry BULLET with you everywhere you go.\nBullet clipped on a backpack.\nAvailable in Matte Black, Gunmetal, and now Blue!\nWe took the smallest, sleekest possible design, and combined it with aircraft-grade aluminum and an anodized finish to bring you a powerful tiny LED light, perfect for everyday use. We believe that the shape, and size kept the design minimal, functional and easy to carry, completely hassle-free in any situation.\nMeasuring in at an incredible 10.5mm x 30mm and weighing only 6 grams, BULLET is the perfect size flashlight for modern day wear. Powered by three LR41 Button Cell batteries to produce 15 lumens of light, keep it with you at all times, anywhere you go. \nWhy BULLET?\nWe like keeping things simple, and easy to carry around everywhere you go. What makes us different? We eliminate the bulk, weight, and hassle from traditional everyday carry flashlights, creating a seamless experience for you every single day.\n Compared to other alternatives, the choice is simple.\nPLAY\n\nDesigned with aerospace-grade aluminum and a sleek anodized finish, the BULLET is built for any situation possible. Rain, sleet, hail, snow, the BULLET will illuminate in any weather, helping solve any problem. \nAn LED light is ideal for everyday use over a long period of time. Never worry about breaking the light, since no glass or filament is used, or replacing it, since LEDs can last a lifetime. Battery's also last much longer with LED light, saving you both time and money in the long haul. \nWhat is an LED you ask? Well, for all you who don\u2019t know, LED\u2019s are the most efficient kind of light bulbs out on the market today. One small bulb can last you anywhere from 25,000 to 100,000 hours. Of course you'll still have to replace the batteries periodically.\nWe went through many iterations, finishes, and housings for the design of BULLET.\nWe decided to use the bottom twist due to the leverage provided by the key ring. By holding onto the keyring, twisting to turn on was easiest. Furthermore, the triangle ring offered increased stability when on a keychain.\nOriginal Prototype Rendering 1\nOriginal Prototype Rendering 2\nOriginal Prototype Rendering 3\nSPECIFICATIONS\nWeight: 6 Grams\nWidth: 10.5mm\nLength: 30mm\nMaterials: Aerospace Grade Aluminum Alloy\nBattery: LR41 Button Cell\nType of Bulb: LED 5mm\nSpecial Features: On/Off Twist Setting, and Mini Keyring Attached\nColors: Matte Black/ Gunmetal\n    Slughaus is a small company based out of San Francisco with the sole mission of helping you stay minimal and functional, all at the same time. We believe that your everyday carry essentials influence your lifestyle. BULLETS' elegance inspires innovation, while its functionality keeps you minimal and on-the-go. We hope that our products not only help keep you minimal, but help mold your lifestyle as a whole.

We think the exact same thing!\nFour Athletics is certainly not that. We aren\u2019t here to clutter store shelves with more outsourced, overpriced, mediocre-quality athletic apparel. We are here to change the way that premium active wear is bought and sold through our innovative business model which allows us to deliver top quality athletic wear at a substantial savings that would not be possible in traditional retail. Here is our story.\nBen, Matt, Casey and Cody\nWe are two sets of brothers who met in college and have been best friends ever since. We are \u201cpeople people\u201d\u2014the kind of guys who want to squeeze every last drop out of life and find any reason to celebrate together. We love to laugh, we are competitive, and we\u2019re constantly trying to out-do each other or play jokes on one another\u2014that is, when we aren\u2019t outdoors, in the gym, or finding another way to sweat.\nA few years ago, Ben and Matt opened a gym in Southern California while Casey and Cody moved to the Bay Area to be employee #4 and #5 at a crowdfunded fashion startup. Our experience with crowdfunding exposed the outdated and costly way that the retail industry operates. It sparked many frustrated conversations about how premium quality athletic wear was getting laughably expensive and the affordable options just weren't holding up to our rigorous lifestyles. Worst of all, it was almost impossible to find anything that was made in the USA. As a group, we have a unique combination of experience in fashion, athletic competition, and the back-end/wholesale side of the clothing industry\u2014so we decided to do something about it ourselves.\nOut of these conversations, countless late nights, phone calls, meetings, and tons of work, Four Athletics was born. By leveraging the power of crowdfunding, we are able to match up supply and demand 100% of the time, and let you choose what we make. We eliminate waste, cut out the middleman, and deliver a premium quality product at a fraction of the retail price.\nFour Athletics isn\u2019t just another athletic brand, it is a better way.

The 4-way stretch material has been tested on a wide range of body types and gives you that perfect athletic fit and the feeling of unlimited range of motion.  Four Athletics will give you that extra boost of confidence and help you feel as good as you look.\n*We have intentionally left the inseam of our Men's and Women's pant a bit longer so you have the option of hemming them to your perfect fit.\nUSING THE FIT GUIDE \u2013 HOW TO DETERMINE YOUR SIZE\nIt is important to note that all of the fit guide measurements are off-the-body garment measurements.  If you are having trouble knowing which size is right for you, this guide will help you measure your best fitting piece of athletic wear and determine your Four Athletics sizing.  Lay your current garment on a flat surface and take each measurement according to the guide below.\nThat said, we are not trying to reinvent the wheel.

The more you do it, the more tiring and frustrating it becomes. To get from here to there, too many of us depend on inferior bags, travel gear and accessories. \nSo, we set out to design a bag that is better than anything else available. Here are six reasons we think G-RO really is different, and better, than any other bag:\nPLAY\n\n1. G-RO IS YOUR COMPANION BAG\nIt's a new kind of crossover bag: a companion bag. We designed it for on-the-go people to be large enough to take on a week-long trip yet maneuverable, durable and light enough for your daily commute.\n2. WHEEL INNOVATION\nAll other rolling luggage is basically a box on casters. Their little wheels break more often; they travel badly over bumps, bricks, grates, snow and sand; they weaken the luggage design with more rivets, screws and reinforcements; they require more parts to assemble and break; they reduce the available volume; and they often cause awkward nooks in the interior space.  \nBut because of our ingenious patented wheel design, G-RO:  \nfeels lighter: the center of gravity of the load is closer of the center of the wheels;\nrolls easier: the big wheels perform so much better over all terrains, and glide effortlessly on smooth surfaces;\nlasts longer: the case and wheels are integrally designed and reinforce each other; \npacks smarter: there's more interior space than other bags of similar weight and volume;\nlooks better: form follows function, and these wheels tell you this is smart design.\n3. TOP-NOTCH HANDLING\nOur aircraft-grade aluminum handle is longer and stronger, too. It extends six inches further than the industry standard, with stops at multiple levels for people of all heights. This gives you better leverage than other rollaboards, and makes it extra comfortable to pull your G-RO.\n4. BUILT TOUGH\nWe designed G-RO from the strongest and smartest materials:\nBallistic nylon\nAerospace and firearm-grade polymers\nTop-quality YKK nylon zippers with a unique (and patented) \"roller coaster\" design that distributes any stress\nWaterproof base and arched belly to stay dry and avoid scrapes.\n5. ROOM FOR WORK AND PLAY\nA spacious interior compartment for personal items\nA compartment for work items \u2014 and it can charge your laptop while you travel\nAn easy access pocket for carry-on liquids\nA personal pocket for essentials.\n6. SUPER POWER\nG-RO has a built-in tablet stand and charging station with two USB ports. And with the Optional Electronic Module, your G-RO has:\nA battery with enough juice (23,000 mAh) to charge your phone, tablet and laptop all at once\u2014that's enough power to charge your smartphone 10X\nA universal power outlet to charge your laptop\nA location tracker\nA wireless proximity detector.\nREINVENTING THE WHEEL\nMost luggage is literally a drag. Back in 1596, the term \u201cluggage\u201d was coined from the word \u201clug\u201d which means \u201cto drag.\u201d Surprisingly, over 400 years later, most of us are still lugging around our bags. Rollaboards were developed in the 1980's, but their small wheels, while an improvement, still haven\u2019t done much to make a bag feel lighter.\nTake a look at our wheels and we think you'll see why they work so much better:\nG-RO's wheels make the bag to feel lighter while also being more spacious and more durable.\nBecause of their large diameter, the wheels support the load closer to its center of gravity, so your bag balances better and feels significantly lighter when you pull it. \nG-RO glides easily over any kind of terrain\u2014cobblestones, curbs, steps, gravel, snow, sand.\nBecause our wheels are on the outside of the bag, our bag offers a larger packable space compared to typical rolling bags.\nOur wheels are made of super strong aerospace and firearm-grade polymers that strengthen the walls of the bag. Unlike traditional bags, the wheels are the strength of this bag\u2014not the weakness.\nLONG, STRONG, ERGONOMIC HANDLE\nG-RO's aircraft grade aluminum four-stage telescoping handle is more than six inches longer than the industry standard! The handle stops at multiple levels and is great for people of all heights. It provides better leverage and comfort.\nSUPER STRONG MATERIALS\nThe body of G-RO is made of high quality Cordura ballistic nylon and mold-injected aerospace-grade polymers. It\u2019s crush proof and water resistant, keeping your belongings safe and sound.\nThe zippers are high quality YKK zippers.  G-RO\u2019s unique \u201croller coaster\u201d zipper design helps distribute any stress across the zipper, creating a longer zipper life.\nARCHED BELLY DESIGN AND WATERPROOF BASE\nG-RO\u2019s arched belly design ensures the bag doesn\u2019t scrape on the ground. \nTo protect your items from water damage, G-RO's bottom protective panel consists of a plastic shell over a waterproof, plastic-coated ballistic nylon textile to ensure that nothing gets wet. \nWORK PLAY COMPARTMENTS FOR WORK LIFE BALANCE\nG-RO has an internal compartment for your personal items and an external compartment for your work items, because no one likes to show their \u201cunmentionables\u201d at a business meeting (or at least most people).\nG-RO helps your private items stay private, but gives you immediate easy access to the items you need while traveling or working. \nSPACIOUS INTERIOR COMPARTMENT FOR PERSONAL ITEMS\nG-RO\u2019s spacious and private interior compartment is flat-backed for easier packing. It includes: \nA detachable flat packing divider for items you want to keep separate or wrinkle-free, \nPlenty of mesh pockets for packing options, \nA removable garment bag for your dress clothes. \n\"NO FISHING\" COMPARTMENT FOR WORK ITEMS\nEver feel like you\u2019re blindly fishing for items in your bag? G-RO solves that problem with its organized, easy-access external compartment. It includes padded pockets for your 15\u201d laptop and plenty of other places for your tablet, papers, pens, etc. \nWith G-RO's Optional Electronic Module, you can charge your laptop while it's in the laptop pocket by connecting your laptop charger to the universal power outlet located at the bottom of the compartment. See the \"Optional Electronic Module\" section for more details.\nCARRY-ON LIQUIDS POCKET\nBreeze through security with this waterproof pocket, especially designed to fit your carry-on liquids.\nPERSONAL POCKET FOR ESSENTIALS\nThis easy access pocket holds your passport or any other essential items you want to keep safe and close to you. \nBUILT-IN CHARGING STATION AND TABLET STAND\nA Built-In Charging Station is built into the top of each G-RO. This waterproof charging station includes: \n2 iPad-strength USB outlets \nSpace for small cables or pens\nNOTE: To charge your devices from the Built-In Charging Station, you must first purchase and connect the G-RO Optional Electronic Module or your own portable charger to the charging cables located in G-RO\u2019s interior compartment. See the \"Optional Electronic Module\" section below for details.\nBuilt-In Charging Station. *Cable not included.\nWhen open, the Built-In Charging Station functions as a tablet stand! \nBuilt-In Tablet Stand\nOPTIONAL ELECTRONIC MODULE\nThe Optional Electronic Module (a $175 value) includes:\nA 23,000 mAh battery\n2 USB ports (that connect to built-in wires, which power the Built-In Charging Station on the top of the bag)\n1 universal power outlet (that fits a three prong laptop plug)\nA location tracker \nA proximity detector\nWith G-RO\u2019s Optional Electronic Module, you can charge your laptop, tablet and smartphone all at once.\nTo purchase this Optional Electronic Module, add $99 for each unit at on the final pledge screen.\n*Universal power outlet extension cord provided with Optional Electronic Module.\nThe Optional Electronic Module plugs into 2 USB cords, located in the bottom pocket of the bag. These cords run through the interior of the bag and connect to and power the Built-In Charging Station at the top of the bag.\nBecause we\u2019re confident in G-RO\u2019s durability and we think it will stay with you for years, we chose not to build the Optional Electronic Module into the bag. We realize that electronics often need an upgrade or need to be replaced. We also wanted to give you the option of using the module outside of G-RO! \nPORTABLE BATTERY\nThe Optional Electronic Module's 23,000 mAh battery is strong enough to charge your smartphone up to 10 times! \n LOCATION TRACKER AND PROXIMITY DETECTOR\nG-RO's Optional Electronic Module uses GSM-GPRS technology for location tracking and Bluetooth Smart/Bluetooth Low Energy technology for proximity detection. Any connected device can then be used to track the global location and proximity of your G-RO. \nYou\u2019ll never lose your G-RO or have to join the crowd at the baggage carousel unnecessarily. You'll be alerted if the bag gets too far away from you. \nOur app is compatible with iOS and Android smart phones that support BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy). \nThe exact specifications are subject to minor changes as we optimize the design for mass production. The weight and capacity are based on computer generated analysis.\nAfter the campaign ends, we will send out a survey so you can choose your color.\nShipping Rates\nWe offer FREE SHIPPING to the United States. For the rest of the world, please check your shipping rate on the check-out menu while backing the project.\nGUARANTEED FOR LIFE ...   \nWe designed and build G-RO to last a lifetime and we stand behind the quality and durability of our products. If your bag ever breaks down, just ship it back to us. We'll either repair it or replace it, and return it to you. It's our lifetime guarantee to you.\n...BECAUSE THAT'S HOW WE ROLL.\nThe latest \u201cgame-changing\u201d luggage configuration - the four-wheel \u201cspinner\u201c luggage with 360 degree turning capabilities, was introduced globally by Samsonite in 1990, more than 25 years ago, but the problem with four-wheel luggage is that it doesn\u2019t really work anywhere except on a perfectly flat surface.\nMore than half of the time people carry their four-wheeled bags in a tilted position, because it\u2019s far more comfortable. If you\u2019re moving over a rough surface, it\u2019s impossible to pull a four-wheeled bag. You\u2019re basically just dragging the weight. Ergonomically, it\u2019s better for you to have the bag pulled slightly behind you than directly at your side. In tight spaces, it\u2019s nearly impossible to roll a bag by your side, so four-wheel users tilt the bag and pull it behind themselves to cut through a crowd. Lastly, if the bag is heavy, maneuvering it can become tiring on the wrist, and with today\u2019s mega terminals, it can be hard to push them for long distances.\nBesides the impracticality of using a four-wheel bag in many scenarios, the four-wheel bags have wheels that protrude and therefore are more likely to catch and break. It\u2019s particularly inconvenient when it\u2019s the ones you need for walking with the bag tilted. Lastly, despite these negatives, one still must pay a 20-30% premium price for these four-wheeled models.\nWe've now finalized our G-RO prototype, but moving to the production phase requires significant capital and scale. We need your help to finance the required tooling and meet minimum order quantities. We've spent months and months working out the tiniest and biggest details of this project, and are very excited about finally having the opportunity to bring the comfort and beauty of G-RO to each one of you.\nKickstarter is a proven start-up platform, whose community of \u201cearly adopters\u201d vets, funds and helps refine new products and services in an efficient, timely manner. The traditional retail model involving distributors, middlemen and retail outlets is costly and adds no value to the actual product or service around which the manufacturer/customer relationship is formed. In fact, it is a major impediment for entrepreneurs, who want to realize their vision for a new consumer product. Therefore, we highly value the Kickstarter community and its role in supporting innovation and hope that together we can launch G-RO.\nThis project is promoted by Jellop, a direct\u00ad response online advertising agency specializing in Kickstarter campaigns on Facebook Ads and Google AdWords.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhile manufacturing a product has become easier in today's well-connected world, it\u2019s still quite a complex challenge. To best prepare for the challenges ahead, we've partnered with supply chain and manufacturing experts and have recruited advisers and board members, who can provide expert advice and help us tackle challenges in production, engineering and retail management.\n\nWe have developed our plan for manufacturing in Asia and for shipping to our backers around the world. We have sourced the factories for all of G-RO\u2019s major components. For the last five years, we've been developing long-term working relationships with these manufacturers, and they have been invaluable and active partners during our prototype development phase. They have approved the G-RO design for its manufacturability and are committed to its success. During the production process, we expect to make minor changes to optimize the design for mass production. On the logistics side, we have established partnerships with a US fulfillment house and international shippers to help the G-ROs get to where they\u2019re going quickly and safely.\n\nAlthough it's difficult to plan for every unforeseen circumstance, such as political or economic events that might delay production or delivery, we've created contingency plans should these type of problems arise. Nevertheless, we are certain to face unexpected challenges throughout this journey and will do our best to solve them quickly. We pledge to keep our backers well-informed in a timely manner throughout the entire production process and to do everything we can to deliver the G-ROs to you as planned.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #46", "update_userinfo": "Final 48 Hours of the G-RO SIX Campaign!", "update_content": " Hi G-RO Backers!\nLast month, we launched a new six-wheel carry-on that\u2019s pushed: the SIX.

This was the foundation for Boulder Denim. Knowing that there are many pants with many features we decided to design a pant that included the most useful of those features, making them the most functional and stylish jeans on the market.\nOur sizing guarantee to YOU:\nIn the year we spent developing Boulder Denim we realized a few important things about fit and sizing.\nFor women, we discovered that we could completely simplify the fitting process when we finally settled on the blend that makes up our patented ultra-stretch denim. After testing our woman\u2019s cut on women that are both slim and curvy, we were able to design a single cut that fits virtually all body types.\nBecause men don\u2019t typically wear skin tight clothing it was important to design a cut that sits naturally on a man\u2019s lower body, while not being overly tight. This discovery lead to the creation of our two fits, SLIM and ATHLETIC.\nWe are so confident with our sizing that if your jeans don\u2019t fit, all you do is send them back to us and we will send you another pair on us.\n*Customers outside of North America will be charged an additional $20 for international shipping.\n FOR MEN:\nTo determine your fit, there are two key measurements.\nFirst, measure the smallest part of your waist at your natural waistline. Second, measure your thigh 2 inches below your crotch Then cross reference, your waist and thigh measurement with the sizing chart to determine your fit. Men looking for a skinny fit can size down. The denim will stretch to your body.\nFOR WOMEN:\nYou only need to measure the smallest part of your waist at your natural waistline. Our jeans are so incredibly stretchy to ensure an absolutely skin tight fit we recommend sizing down.\nMade with the climber in mind and created to truly combine fashion and adventure for a slimmer fit you can wear anytime.\nMedium rise that sits just above the hip, slim through the thigh, knee and calf with a slight taper\nOffers a perfectly tailored fit that works for men with slim to medium legs.\nFits well for slim or medium builds as the taper increases proportionally with waist size.\nBEST FOR: Men with slim to medium legs that want a tailored look.\nFor the gym rat, crossfitter or bodybuilder. This fit is muscular-glute approved and designed for men that spend a lot time in the gym.\nMedium rise that sits just above the hip, more room through the thigh, knee and calf with a slight taper.\nOffers more thigh and calf room for men with muscular legs.\nBEST FOR: Men with big legs that have trouble finding pants that can accommodate their thighs. These are for the crossfitter, bodybuilder or football player that never skips leg day. They also look great on men with thicker legs or larger builds that are looking for a roomier fit.\nDesigned to combine our 360-degree stretch and a perfect cut that embraces the natural movement of a woman\u2019s body. The stretch is perfect for women of all shapes.\nMedium/Higher rise, that is meant to move with you as your body bends.\nThe ultra-stretch denim allows you to have a higher-waist that doesn\u2019t restrict movement or dig in when you bend over.\nBEST FOR: Women that are slim to very curvy. The denim is so unbelievably stretchy that it will hug even the most curvaceous women.\nSo rest assured and order with confidence that not only will these pants fit you perfectly and feel amazing, your butt will look phenomenal!\nThe Boulder Denim brand was inspired by necessity and created by adventurists. We know what it\u2019s like having to balance our thirst for thrill and everyday responsibilities. Which is why created our denim to cater to whatever it is your day has in store for you. Aside from selling comfortable pants, we wanted to be the true advocates for adventure and we\u2019ll do this by giving back to you, our amazing community. \n#1 | Every year a portion of our earnings will go towards our \u201cWhat\u2019s your adventure?\u201d campaign.

How? Nature2X combines four fibers that interact with each other to increase the beneficial performance features of each fiber while offsetting the weaknesses of each fibre; woven together you get fabric perfection.\nTencel: moisture absorbing, naturally anti bacterial and odor resistant\nPolyester: durable, quick dry\nCotton: breathable and comfortable\nSpandex: maximum stretch and memory\nThe foundation of Nature2X fabric is Tencel\u00ae because it absorbs moisture from your skin and stores in inside the fiber so that you don't feel wet but your skin still has access to enough moisture to feel comfortable. (Your skin always needs a certain level of moisture to avoid irritation. The added bonus is that Tence\u00ael naturally stops bacteria from growing too-no smell.\nHowever, Tencel\u00ae is a limp fiber that expands over time so we added polyester for hold, strength and durability. The downside of polyester is that it attracts bacteria and causes irritation on your skin if it makes up a large percentage of a fabric because it doesn't hold any moisture at all.\nPolyester adds the strength and Tencel adds the intelligence; moisture management. Then we added cotton to the mix for natural breathability and extra comfort. Cotton is a soft, natural fiber that is also very durable over time.\nFinally, we add spandex so that the fabric will stretch everywhere across it's surface giving the garment flexibility and memory.\n Men\u2019s 5 Pocket fits:\n Men\u2019s 5 Pocket colours:\nMen\u2019s 5 Pocket sizes:\nAvailable waist sizes: 28, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 36, 38, 40\nAvailable inseam: 30\u201d, 32\u201d and 34\u201d\n Men\u2019s Jogger colours:\nMen\u2019s Jogger sizes:\nAvailable waist sizes: 28, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 36, 38, 40\nAvailable inseam: 29 1/2\u201d\n Women\u2019s 5 Pocket Skinny features:\n\u2022 Moisture wicking\n\u2022 Durable Fabric\n\u2022 Antibacterial\n\u2022 Fly Zipper\n\u2022 Beltloops\n\u2022 Leather trims\nWomen's 5 Pocket Skinny colours:\n*NEW* Colour Unlocked - EVERGREEN:\nWomen\u2019s 5 Pocket Skinny sizes:\nAvailable waist sizes: 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34\nAvailable inseam: 28\u201d and 31\u201d\nWomen\u2019s Jogger features:\n\u2022 Moisture wicking\n\u2022 Antibacterial\n\u2022 Durable Fabric\n\u2022 Optimal Stretch\n\u2022 Elastic Cuff\n\u2022 Fly Zipper\n\u2022 Beltloops\n\u2022 Leather trims\nWomen\u2019s Jogger colours:\nWomen\u2019s Jogger sizes:\nAvailable waist sizes: 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34\nAvailable inseam: 29 1/2\u201d\nMeasuring Tips:\nAll measurements should be taken directly on the body.\nIf your measurements suggest different sizes, follow sizing based on hip measurement.\nIf you are inbetween sizes or in doubt, we recommend sizing down from the size you would normally wear.\nWe need your help to go into full production with this amazing fabric.

It takes years of training and experience to make a pant pattern that fits in all the right places and moves as you do. Luckily for you, we've done this before.

We delivered our L2X denim on time and people loved the fit, performance and quality of our product.\n\nSince our last project we've been able to build relationships a number of retailers and maintain ongoing sales of our performance denim. Unfortunately, we were late delivering our stretch goal (black L2X denim) because it was added at the last minute and the first fabric did not pass our quality standards.

Gone are the days when we have to use outdated textiles, such as cotton and polyester. We are now seeing huge leaps in garment textiles in terms of sustainability, comfort and performance. Tencel is at the forefront of this new wave.  \nAn ultra sustainable, high-tech nano-fiber from Austria. Tencel is 100% natural and completely made from organic PEFC certified Eucalyptus wood through a non-toxic and renewable process. It's full of awesome features, making our baselayer a perfect complement for your winter adventures.\nGraphic adapted from image provided by Lenzing AG\nImage provided by Lenzing AG\nGet Your Project Funded Today!\n                  Our baselayer has an extremely low ecological footprint, using 20x less water to produce than cotton, and generating 5x less carbon emissions than polyester. Under compost conditions it will biodegrade in just 12 days.    \nTencel is OEKO-TEX 100 Class 1 (safe for use on infants) certified hypoallergenic because it contains no irritants, harmful chemicals or by-products. While other botanic fibers such as bamboo are often manufactured with a concoction of harmful chemicals, Tencel uses only a single organic and biodegradable solvent during its 100% non-toxic \u201cclosed-loop\u201d manufacturing process. This special process received the \u201cEuropean Award for the Environment\u201d for its better than 99.7% recovery rate of all solvent used in the manufacturing process. Unlike cotton, Tencel requires no bleaching or any other chemical processing during production.   \nOur fiber in our fabric is made up of millions of nanofibers, resulting in high strength and elasticity. Tencel is the strongest botanic fiber ever produced,more than 2x stronger than cotton. This results in our baselayer being incredibly wrinkle resistance.\nTencel is highly shrink resistant, so our baselayer will run true to size, wash after wash. Plus, it's completely dryer safe.   \nWe also reinforced our stitching using highly elastic threads to make sure the seams never pull apart. \nWe partnered with a world leading manufacturer of high end European brands to ensure production quality and consistency. The team meticulously considered each structural design to maximize comfort and fit, perfecting the design through many prototypes and iterations with stitch type, thread count, sizing and different Tencel variations.   \nWe promote ethical practices and have gone to lengths to make sure we are working with manufacturers that pay fair wages to its workers.\nBrandless & Tag Free. In a world full of advertising and visual clutter, we prefer to be understated & confident, allowing the exceptional quality and performance of our baselayer to sing all the praises for us.   \nLight-weight 190 g/m2: We recommend using this baselayer for mild to cold temperatures. You should also be layered properly to keep warm with a second layer as well as a insulating outer layer. This version is designed for people that commute within an urban area or for a day out on the slopes for skiing/snowboarding. We will be releasing a thicker version blended with a special wool in the future for more extreme conditions.   \nChoosing your native size will mean an athletic fit - neither tight nor loose. Go 1 size lower for a more snug & slim fit. Go 1 size up for a relaxed fit. \nThe softness and elasticity of our fabric makes our baselayer very versatile in terms of fit. You can wear 2 sizes down and it will still fit well and look great. Our model below, who normally wears XXL is seen here wearing a M.\n              Do not manually adjust your pledge for add-ons anymore. Please wait for your Backerkit survey and you can add/change/mix & match anything you want for the same price on Kickstarter in an ultra simple and intuitive interface.\nWe've added a tiered delivery schedule. See Update #4 for details.\n\nWe will ship worldwide from Maryland USA. Shipping within continental USA is free. Shipping to Canada starts at $5. Please check our rewards section for international shipping rates.\nOur 1st Wave Delivery Estimate is Early February for the first 510 backers.\n\nOur 2nd Wave Delivery Estimate is March / April for backers past 510.\nWe realize that this product is delivering when winter is already in full swing, but we came to this decision with good reason. It boils down to this:\n\nEarlier Launch = Earlier Delivery = Less Chance of Success \nBecause if we launched earlier in the year, most people aren\u2019t thinking about winter & thermal clothing yet.\nLater Launch = Later Delivery = More Chance of Success \nBecause more people start thinking about thermal gear as winter approaches.\nWe found that this balance was incredibly hard to strike. After much thought, we decided that an early November Kickstarter launch - resulting in a late Jan to early Feb delivery - was the best balance between being able to succeed, and still delivering a quality product in the midst of winter, bringing you an awesome piece of gear that will serve you well for the rest of winter this year, and for many winters to come. In fact, the shirt and legging are so comfortable all of our beta testers ended up wearing them everyday at home! So rest assured you can enjoy these clothes even after winter ends.\nWe have a storage facility ready in Baltimore, Maryland close to Amazon warehouses. We are planning on using Amazon\u2019s amazing fulfillment service (FBA) in the United States. Amazon are known for their delivery speed and quality packaging. I\u2019m sure many of you have ordered things from Amazon and you can expect the same speed and quality from us. It also allows us to make returns & exchanges a breeze for our customers. For international shipping, we will manually ship to you through USPS or DHL.\nWe promise you'll love them. If your shirt and/or leggings doesn\u2019t fit you the way we\u2019ve described, or if it develops any defects, we\u2019ll exchange them for another size of your choice within 60 days. International shipments will carry special considerations depending on each situation. Defective items do not require return shipping.

To order some SilverAir Socks & Shirts, head on over to yathletics.com\nWhy You'll Love The SilverAir Crew Sock:\n\nOur Story\nY Athletics was born on Kickstarter and this is our third project. We started this company because we felt that there was a void in the market for an activewear brand that offered smart design, cutting-edge technology, and a simple shopping experience. \n\nIn 2013, we launched the SilverAir shirt, our first product that's loved by thousands of backers around the world. Earlier this year, we launched the SilverAir Sock (ankle length), which became the most successful crowdfunded sock in the world. Ever since that campaign, we've received countless requests to make a longer sock that can be worn in more places, so we got to work.\nYour feedback led to a sock that's more refined in every way. It's the most versatile sock available today. We're incredibly excited to finally introduce the SilverAir Crew Sock.\nWe kept all of the best features from the ankle length version, which received phenomenal feedback from Kickstarter backers. It includes the same blend of Merino Wool and our signature SilverAir Silver. We altered the ventilation system to provide airflow when you're wearing different types of shoes, and the upper portion of this sock now features a 1x1 rib for a firm yet comfortable grip that won't become loose over time.\n\nWhile we've been able to finance the development of the sock ourselves, we need your help with manufacturing our first production run. We hope you'll help us bring this to life.\n\nHow it Works\nWhere It's Made\nSOCKS:\nSHIRTS:\nColors & Styles\nOur crew socks will be available in two colors:\nOur ankle socks will be available in three colors:\n Our shirts will be available in both Crew Neck and V Neck in four colors:\nMeasurement Guide\nhttp://yathletics.com/pages/sizing\nShipping & Delivery Schedule\nKickstarter backers will receive their shirts and socks together in April/May 2016, except for Backers 1-1000 within the USA, who will receive the crew socks in December and the remaining rewards in April/May 2016. We estimate the following timeline:\nDEC 2015 - Campaign closes. Backers' selections finalized. \nJAN 2016 - Raw materials are bought and shipped to our factory.\nFEB 2016 - Production period. \nMAR 2016 - Production period.\nAPR 2016 - Finished products are shipped to our distribution center\nMAY 2016 - All rewards are shipped to backers\nWhere We are\nWe started working on the crew socks earlier this year, after an overwhelming number of requests from backers of our ankle socks to make this product. Since we already spent time engineering the fabric for the previous SilverAir Sock, we were able to develop several prototypes and put them through testing all within this time period. We're happy to report that the crew socks are now just right, and ready to go into production.\nInternational Backers\nCarrier - We ship to most other international countries via FedEx, to ensure the package is delivered to you safely in the shortest amount of time. In our survey, we will also give you the option to opt-in for USPS as the carrier. However, if you opt-in for USPS, we will not guarantee delivery. Only orders to Canada will be shipped USPS by default.\nDuties, Taxes & Clearing Fees - All international shipments are subject to duties, taxes and clearing fees and you are responsible for paying that. All Kickstarter rewards will be declared 'gift', however, most countries will assess a value and in certain countries the carrier will pre-pay the duties and taxes and bill you later.\n\nIf you refuse delivery of your package and it is returned to us, we will refund your pledge amount minus any shipping charges incurred (both ways) and a 8% handling fee.\n--", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our third Kickstarter project.

NanoDri sweat-blocking undershirts and sports shirts are for those who tend to sweat excessively but don't necessarily want to let others know about it.   \nThe shirts are sweat-absorbent on the inside but breathable and sweat repellent on the outside and thus effectively block sweat stains from showing to your outer garments.  \nWe plan on making 2 main products:  \n1. Sweat-blocking undershirts\nFor men\nFor women\n2. And sweat-blocking sports shirts\nFor men\nBoth products use the same Made in Japan technology and fabric.\nGo ahead...sweat.\n With features like these, you're covered.\nNanoDri sweat-blocking undershirt features\nTake a look at the core structure and functionality of the fabric. Hydrophobic (water repellent) on one side, hydrophilic (water absorbent) on the other.\nNanoDri Fabric Inner structure\n Even when stretched, the fabric repels water! Yet, it is very breathable.\n NanoDri Properties\n1. Fast moisture absorbing technology\u2014Absorbs liquid at least 3X faster than cotton. Sweat coming into contact with the mesh fabric is immediately wicked inside, pulling it away from the skin, where it is absorbed inside the intricate fibers that comprise the fabric interior.\nNanoDri superior absorption\n 2. Sweat-blocking but breathable exterior.\nNanoDri breathable weat-repellent fabric\n3. Sweat-absorbing interior. \n4. All-over protection\u2014unlike other sweat blocking undershirts, sweat resistance is present all over the shirts, not just in the underarms. This means sweat is prevented from coming through all over, including the chest, back and sides. \n5. Anti-bacterial/anti-fungal treated for freshness. \n6. No special treatments or detergents needed for garment care. \n7. Interior micro-air space to aid in sweat evaporation. \n8. For undershirts, extra length at the bottom means it stays tucked in. \n9. Stretchy for comfort. \n10. Extremely quick drying made-in-Japan quality fabric. \n11. Tagless for comfort. \n12. Double sided mesh to maximize air flow and eliminate clinging.\nNanoDri double sided mesh fabric\n13. For undershirts, deep V-neck for men or deep U-neck for women means it stays hidden under button down shirts. \n14. Thinner/lighter than other sweat resistant undershirts. \n15. Ultra-soft fabric and long lasting sweat-blocking effects. The sweat repellancy properties are due to nanotechnology-based molecular reactions within the fabric itself, not spray-on chemicals. So even after 100 washes, significant sweat repellancy remains an intrinsic property of the fabric. \n16. Non-sticking\u2014Unlike cotton\nFor the best fit, compare your current undershirt size with the chart below and choose the closest match.\nNanoDri Mens Undershirt Sizing chart\n For the best fit, compare your current undershirt size with the chart below and choose the closest match.\nWomens undershirt sizing guide\n                              NanoDri Sweat-blocking undershirts \nNanodri sweat-blocking sports shirt\n For the best fit, compare your current undershirt size with the chart below and choose the closest match.\nNanoDri Sports shirt sizing guide\nThe Story of NanoDri\nThe story of NanoDri began in August, 2011, a few months after the Great East Japan earthquake shook the country, unleashing the biggest tsunami and nuclear meltdown in Japan\u2019s history. \n   It was 8:30 am on a Monday morning and I was riding the train to work as usual. It was going to be another sweltering day; the temperature had already hit 32 degrees C (90 degrees F) even this early in the day. The train was packed as usual, but I had been lucky to get a seat that morning\u2014that almost never happens. That year was especially bad because the earthquake resulted in the country\u2019s nuclear power plants being shut down, and an electricity savings plan had been implemented by the government to try to save energy, causing many of the trains to reduce their use of air conditioning. But even with full air conditioning on, I had always arrived at work soaked in sweat. It is very humid in Japan in the summer and during that season, the trains become 300 foot mobile saunas. \n  On that particular day, in front of me was a rather large fellow, not Sumo sized but big nonetheless, who was sweating profusely. He took a towel he had draped over his shoulder and proceeded to lift up his sweat-soaked t-shirt and dry off his chest and stomach like he had just come out of the shower. I began to wonder if getting that particular seat was really that lucky after all. But despite my apparent misfortune, I couldn\u2019t help but think how nice it would be to dry off with a towel like he had if no one was looking. The NanoDri seed had been planted.\n I then became a towel expert. Microfiber, terry, bamboo, viscose\u2014which would be the best? I tested dozens of towel materials as undershirts, most from China, some from Japan, but ultimately concluded that there were 2 problems that I couldn\u2019t overcome: 1) the towel needed to be stretchy but also thin. While I could find stretchy terry material, it never worked as well as the thicker cotton terry materials, which were not stretchy. It never felt as good. Also, towels can soak up sweat very well, but wearing a wet towel under my shirt didn't sound too appealing. Then I started thinking more about using thinner fabrics but taking a more technological approach. I was in Japan after all, a country that is highly advanced in its fabric technology. \nAs a bio-molecular scientist, I was particularly interested in getting nanotechnology to confer specific properties to fabric. After testing dozens of fabrics and treatments, I settled on the the following requirements. \nThe fabric would be polyester, the best quick-drying fabric there is.\nThe inside would be wicking to draw sweat away from the body and highly sweat absorbent \nThe outside would be a sweat resistant barrier, yet would retain its breathability to allow sweat vapor and outside air through so that the shirt would dry out quickly while it was still being worn. \nThe fabric would also have anti-bacterial and anti-fungal properties to prevent the buildup of bacteria, fungi and other nasties. \nJapan is a world leader in fabric technologies and is renown for its product quality and safety, so the fabric would be made in Japan. \nNanoDri is all about imparting specific functions to fabric. NanoDri means \u201cthe use of nano-technology to confer a state of dryness\u201d, and that\u2019s exactly what these garments do.\nWhere NanoDri stands now\nI have tested dozens of fabrics from companies all over the world under conditions that would make a camel sweat. I have chosen an amazing fabric and technology made in Japan that strikes the perfect balance between sweat absorption and repellency. I have secured a Japanese fabric manufacturer and maker who are ready to start sewing once  once funds for a minimum order fabric lot have been secured.\n But I need your help to get that minimum order amount ordered and your help to get the word out about this product.\nSome people just can't contribute. We get that. Therefore, we ask that, contribute or not, you get the word out of these products. You just may change someone's for the better without even realizing it.\nNanoDri Q and A\nQ: How long does the sweat-blocking effect last?\nA: The sweat repellancy properties of the outer layer of the fabric are built on nanotechnology-based molecular reactions within the fabric itself, not spray-on chemicals. So even after 100 washes, significant sweat repellancy remains an intrinsic property of the fabric.\nQ: The shirt is water repellent on the outside. How can it be cleaned in a washing machine? Doesn\u2019t the water just bounce off?\nA: While the shirt may be water repellent, dirt, dead skin and other microscopic particulates can still stick to it in some cases. Water will simply remove the adherent gunk that happens to attach to the outer layer over time. Of course, the inside of the shirt is water absorbent, so detergent has the typical cleaning effect here.\nQ: Are the shirts water-proof?\nA: No they are water repellent. If they were water-proof, they wouldn\u2019t be breathable and you would not be able to cool off your body or evaporate the accumulated sweat. You would literally be swimming in your own sweat.\nQ: Water-proof and water repellent, what\u2019s the difference?\nA: Water proof means that no water can go through at all regardless of the pressure applied. This usually involves sealing the fabric with a water impenetrable membrane. Doing this however sacrifices breathability and also significantly reduces the stretchability of the fabric and this is unacceptable for an undershirt. Ever try taking off a non-stretchable sweat-soaked undershirt? Not a pleasant task. And being able to rid yourself of sweat through evaporation with the help of a breathable fabric is essential to keeping cool. Water repellency means that water beads off the fabric and is prevented from going through, but water vapor and gases can still pass. However, if the pressure of the water is high enough, e.g., if the water hits the fabric at a high velocity, it will pass through. This is obviously not a problem as far as blocking sweat is concerned, unless of course you shoot out sweat drops at speeds faster than rain drops in a thunderstorm.\nQ: Are the shirts oil-repellent?\nA: They are oil-repellent to some degree. Oil from the skin is primarily absorbed into the inner sweat-absorbent layer of the fabric, where it stays until washed.\nQ: Does the shirt require any special treatments such as ironing or special detergents to make it work?\nA: No, you treat the shirt as you would any other shirt. No ironing or special detergents or treatments necessary.\nQ: What are the washing conditions?\nA: Wash in water under 40 degrees C (104 F) and line dry. You will find that by the time your shirt comes out of the spin dry cycle of your wash, its already nearly dry!\nQ: Are there any things I should not do regarding the shirts?\nA: The only major thing to avoid is the use of fabric softener, which may decrease the effectiveness of the water repellency effect. Also, while dry cleaning may not harm the shirt\u2019s effectiveness, it is best not to dry clean just to be safe. It is also unnecessary.\nQ: Are the undershirts see-through?\nA: No. NanoDri Sweat-blocking undershirts are thin enough to wear under regular t-shirts or button-downs, but thick enough to not be see-through; thus, you can either wear the shirts as you would a traditional undershirt or on their own or with an open button-down shirt.\nQ: Do the shirts block sweat from coming through all over, or only in the underarms?\nA: The shirts have all-over protection.\nQ: I am too small/too large for your stated sizes. What do I do?\nA: First of all, the fabric is quite stretchy, so larger sized people may still be able to fit into the 2XL. However, we can also tailor-make your shirt to whatever size you like. Because we are only making S,M,L, XL and 2XL sizes at the moment, any other size would incur a doubling of cost, as we would have to special order it. You would also have to provide detailed measurements. It would take upwards of around a month to do this.\nQ: Do you have women\u2019s sport shirts?\nA: While we presently sell both men\u2019s and women\u2019s undershirts, for sports shirts, only the men\u2019s are available. We may change this if demand warrants.\nQ: Is the fabric safe?\nA: NanoDri fabrics are EPA and FDA compliant. We use similar chemicals as some of the major clothing labels that sell water repellent jackets and other outer garments. The difference is in the patented fabric processing, which is where our Japanese partners come in. We can make very thin stretchy materials water repellent and have the effect retained through more than 100 washes.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our first attempt at clothing production so we had a lot to learn. However, we have the sample products made, they work, and the fabrics have been tested over many months. We also have partnered with some of the biggest Japanese tech companies to bring this product to market. Their quality is superb, even as judged by my ridiculously high standards. \n\nOur challenge is that the fabric preparation takes months. So we need to start early, which is why we are launching now. We need your support to reserve the minimum lot of fabric and get it processed and dyed. There are no last minute orders. Missing out now means no second chance to order later and you will have to suffer through another summer next year.\n\nAnother challenge is that we have never exported garments to a drop shipper before, so there is a risk that, despite all the preparation, some unforseen regulation may prevent the product from arriving to its destination when shipped to drop shippers in bulk. However, even this will not be a problem, as we will also carry stock in Japan, so we can easily ship out individual orders on time around the world from here through the always reliable EMS mail service rather than having to rely on other country's drop-shippers, so you will get your shirts before summer next year for sure.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Progenomics LLC\n9 created \u00b7 1 backed\nThe creator of NanoDri shirts is a Canadian Ph.D. scientist in molecular biochemistry.

SAF will achieve this goal by developing open-source software (and maybe hardware) tools that partially automate difficult and tedious aspects of the filmmaking process such as organization and rote structuring.  As a proof-of-concept for this idea, for my Master's Thesis at Georgia Tech, I developed the free Android app, Documatic, to help automate portions of the documentary creation process.\nI think that really powerful tools can be developed from this simple idea and so I am releasing all the code as open for development on GitHub. \nWhere will this money go?\nBecause many large scale, open-source, collaborative coding projects tend to sputter-out at a certain point, I am launching this kickstarter to set feature and bugfix bounties. This can provide concrete incentives and financial support to encourage the wonderful volunteers working on this project to keep going!\nHelp out!\nIf you, do not wish to become a financial backer, please just share this kickstarter and video with your friends. The important thing is not, necessarily, that we create this project. What's important is spreading this the grander idea of improving the video workflow for small filmmakers by harnessing the affordances available in truly digital filmmaking.\nIf you are inspired to join the team to help with the development, please visit the main website: www.semiautomaticfilmmaking.org", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "A Quitmeyer\nFirst created \u00b7 16 backed\nI'm a soon-to-be PhD student at Georgia Tech researching Digital media, space subversions, computer vision, and social animal behavior.See more"}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #1", "update_userinfo": "Thanks so much!", "update_content": "Hi guys!

As it draws near, we focus on a pregnant couple who have gone into labor during those final minutes before darkness strikes. With a world falling to pieces around them and the accompanying riots, lawlessness and crime, how will they reach the hospital? And if they safely deliver the child, the greater question remains: how will they raise a child in a world where humanity's time has become finite? \nPart sci-fi and visual effects thriller, mostly heart and character drama, 8.31 is an examination of what makes us human against the backdrop of a mankind's possible end.\nour team\nUtilizing frequent collaborators, and favors from professional film and television artists, we will create a groundbreaking short film. We want the visual effects to be a seamless backdrop of the near future, while focusing almost entirely on story and character. With so much happening in the world right now, we were inspired to write this story based on the premise of recognizing what we hold dear while everything else falls apart. \nHere are the people signed on and involved in the project. We will be funding most of the budget from our own pockets, but the extra money we raise here will help to build the world with visual effects in a way that creates a totally convincing, immersive cinema experience on a shoestring budget. 3,500 will get us started with that goal, more will certainly help. We plan to tour the country through film festivals when the film is finished.\nCome help us be a part of this endeavor.

However, I discovered that income was more complex and interesting than I originally thought. So I continued my research and began posting new infographics to a website: VisualizingEconomics.com. While I cover other subjects that catch my fancy (stock markets, growth of countries, taxes), I keep returning to income as I find new and interesting data. You may have seen my work at Slate.com, NPR.org, WashingtonPost.com, MSNBC, PBS Newshour and on popular financial blogs. VisualizingEconomics.com is recommended as a resource for teachers by the Library of Congress. Also some graphs have been reproduced in college textbooks.\nThe Average Income graph below is one of the most popular posts on my site. Other examples of my work can be found at VisualizingEconomics.com\nTHE PROJECT\nWhat is the income for different types of jobs?... Who makes the most money?... How does income in United States compare to other countries... How has income changed since the 1920s? 1950s? 1980s?\nI will design a collection of infographics that tells the story of income in the United States. This will be a comprehensive overview of the subject using data placed in historical context and will include NEW infographics created just for this collection. It will have explanations for economic terms like CPI or GDP for those readers who don't have a background in economics.\nAll the data will come from public data sources such as the US Census, IRS, Congressional Budget Office, Bureau of Labor Statistics, Bureau of Economic Analysis plus data from academic articles and other research on the subject.\nTHE REWARDS\nFirst look at early drafts of the infographics I create.\nInfographic Zine PDF copy (A high resolution format suitable for presentations or printing on 8.5x11\" paper.)\nInfographic Zine Paper copy (A full color printed booklet, 32-40 pages saddle-stitched like a magazine.)\nInfographic T-Shirt (I will design this t-shirt based one of the income infographics used in my zine.)\nIncome Tape Measure\nWhen I first started working on my poster How Much Do You Earn? I struggled to display the range of income from $10,000 a year to $200,000,000 on the same scale. Later, when I tried adding hedge fund managers, I had to increase the scale to 1.5 billion dollars. Therefore, for my last reward I plan to solve this problem by creating 10 measuring tapes (each at least 30 feet long) that will map income dollars \u2013> inches. Each measuring tape will cover the entire income distribution in the United States (which could exceed $1.5 billion according to the Wall Street Journal).\nThe minimum pledge amount is $5. All pledge amounts include shipping costs.\nTHE TASKS\nI estimate 4-6 months to complete this project.\nTasks include: Analyzing the data. Sketch new visualizations. Design and create infographics. Write and edit the copy. Gather feedback and iterate as needed. Print zine for supporters. Design and print t-shirts. Design and create Income Measuring Tape. Mail everything.\nAfter the infographic zine is mailed to my supporters, I plan to post low-resolution versions of the final visualizations to VisualizingEconomics.com. All the infographics in the zine and online will be available through a Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-Share Alike license.\nTHE FUNDING\nWhere's this money going? First, pay for the cost of producing the zine, t-shirts & tape measures, and second, allow me to focus exclusively on research/writing/designing for a few months.\nYour credit card won't be charged for the amount you specify unless I get $6,000 (or more) in pledges by the deadline. After this deadline has passed, no more pledges can be made.\n(P.S. thanks to The Noun Project for some of icons used in my proposal)", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #26", "update_userinfo": "Check out my blog at VisualizingEconomics.com", "update_content": "FYI, I have been publishing a series of posts on my website highlighting stories about the economy using the graphics from my book.

And best of all, if you could play with that? Well, if you like the idea of the twittersphere becoming a virtual universe, this is for you.\nWelcome to Tweet Land, the first set of videogames that plays with reality.\nThis project was born because we always thought that it would be really fun if what people comment in Twitter could turn real. You know, from the serious stuff twitters sometimes talk about, to the really nonsense tweets people make daily. So we decided to start working on this idea, and that\u2019s how Tweet Land was born. We have now advanced a lot and are really excited, but our resources are limited. So we need your help to make Tweet Land what everybody of us dream of. \nIn this universe you will be able to play several videogames. Tweet Land will be launched with two initial games. A racing game called Route 140 and an action game called Love City. Check out the video to watch the action gameplay. Hope you like them. Enjoy!\nThe game works really simple. Every time someone in the world tweets something, his or her tweets could affect the gameplay of Tweet Land by triggering certain action-keywords. It could be a \"car accident\" in your racing game, it could be your hate-gun gets reloaded in the action game, it could be anything.\nWe have created tons of situations that are triggered by their relative keywords that people might tweet. Some of them are:\ncar accident\nmeteor\nshooting star\ntsunami\nvolcano eruption\nfireflies\nzombie\nbeach\nlove\nhate\nshotgun\nlightsaber\nWe have many many more, but we don\u2019t want to spoil your game. And we will create even more. Many will be based on trend topics, many on actual events, and many others will be odd stuff people tweet (you know that happens a lot!).\nThe sweet part comes from the fact that people around the world are always creating tweets for the game based on their real-life experiences; even if they are not playing; even if they don\u2019t know anything about Tweet Land. So the events and the gameplay are always changing within the web and its thousands of conversations.\nTweet Land is the first set of videogames that plays with reality, making it different every time you play and endlessly replayable. Its main features are:\nWe have plenty of Tweet Land done. But we have many more work to do and many things to pay for. We plan to launch Tweet Land before mid 2011, for iPhone and web browser with two initial games. One of the games is a racing game called Route 140 and the other is an action game called Love City. With your support we can:\nsecure the ongoing development and multiplatform release\npay the dedicated servers necessary to run the Twitter integration correctly\nbuy software licenses\nand lock the Beta-phase so we can launch on date\nAs some of the rewards, we are giving to every pledge of $5 or more a pre-order of the game so you can download it when it is ready, and for every pledge of $15 or more we are giving Tweet Land beta-test access before the game is on public release so you can help us build it with your ideas. Check the other cool rewards on the top side-bar.\nWe are a group of friends from sunny Costa Rica that all of our lives have been really passionate about videogames and the web. For this reason every one of us has specialized since years ago into web/software development, graphic design, audio composition, e-marketing, social media and digital creativity. We already have worked in award-winning projects (\u2018Romeria Virtual\u2019 won Silver Cannes Lion; \u2018Wackylands Boss\u2019 became an AppleStore Top Paid Game; etc.) in our daytime jobs, but we thought it was time to jump out and start working in our own fun stuff. To stop the talk, and start the doing.\nHope you share our vision, and either you help us with a pledge or by spreading the word (give us a Like or tweet about it), we will really appreciate your support. \nGracias!

I come from an electronic music background so I welcome any requests!\nKids and Family - For those people looking for a happy medium between spending thousands of dollars on expensive instruments that will only get used a handful of times or say RockBand (which is fun but hardly educational), learning to play the invisible instrument will allow for a safe arena for music discovery while building a foundation for music performance -- the instruments are based on the  acoustic equivalent, after all.\nEveryone - For non-musicians and musicians alike, the invisible instrument is a portable, inexpensive tool that can be utilized by itself as a musical instrument or in conjunction with other recording and performance software to expedite music creation! Help support the instrument revolution today!\nWhy? The idea, the goal.\nThe goal of this project is to create an affordable, portable musical tool that bridges classical instrumentation to computer/electronic music.\nAlthough I was classically trained in music, I also ventured into the computer music world at an early age. I noticed, though, there existed a sharp divide between the two fields. Many classical musicians I knew scoffed at the idea that a computer could produce a timbre that would even remotely compare to an acoustic instrument. Similarly, I have known computer musicians who regard classical music as an antiquated field. My thought? C'mon -- it's 2011, it's about time we connected the two a little better.\nAdditional Links\nFor more demos: http://www.invisibleinstruments.com\nhttp://www.timsoo.com\nFAQ:\nWill there be a similar app using Android? As an Android user myself, I will more than likely be building an app for Android users.\nWhat shows up on the computer screen? For traditional instruments, there is a natural physical feedback with each note: the vibration of the string, the buzz of the trumpet. Well the feedback for the invisible instrument is in visual form -- you'll see the instrument you're playing and know what exactly you're doing when you do each movement. (Which particular drum is being hit, what string you're on). Granted, you can still use the instrument without it, but I imagine it will help when beginning to learn.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Tim Soo\n2 created \u00b7 3 backed\nDeveloper, Medical Student, Entrepreneur, Musician, Thrill-Seeker We dedicate my lives to solving the world's complex issues and problems...See more"}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #7", "update_userinfo": "Corrected Link.", "update_content": "Apologies!

Each episode will follow one ancient problem and explore how it reoccurs again and again in more modern forms. This allows us to follow conceptual ideas along the context of their inception - making it easier to digest challenging theoretical ideas.\nFeminine Perspective:\nThis program incorporates a strong feminine perspective, which I feel is very important when explaining scientific concepts. I make sure that all scripts are checked by a female editor who comes from a non-technical background and use my wife Lyndsay to narrate the story.\nWhy do This? \nI learned most of this stuff in school, but it was taught in a way that made it seem inaccessible.

A Chair?\nThis furniture is designed or customized using a simple 2d drawing interface.  The program automatically generates a structure for your chair and lets you simulate sitting on it with a virtual model of yourself.\nAs you interact with the tool, it generates the cutting pattern for your design, which can then be sent to a digital fabrication machine.\nA physics engine tests the stability of the chair, allowing you to ensure that the chair will stand and comfortably support you.\nWe have a working prototype of SketchChair, including a number of full size trial chairs.  The program has a number of tools for making simple or complex changes to a design, such as adjusting profile outlines, changing the number of layers, or controlling the symmetry of the chair.  These tools will continue to evolve as we develop the software.  Once we have finished development, the program and the source will be freely available online.\nIf you would love to start using the program and have the opportunity to watch and discuss its development with us, you can become a contributor with one of our pledge rewards!\nOpen-Source Furniture Design?\nWithin the program, users will be able to upload chairs they have created, which will then go on display at SketchChair.cc.  Any of these chairs can then be downloaded and edited, allowing chair designs to evolve as users continually refine and modify them.  In this way we hope that SketchChair will be like an open-source Ikea store, filled with customisable products!\nHow can I get a SketchChair?\nWe are offering pre-designed SketchChairs as pledge rewards, starting with the Antler Chair, our flagship design. There are already a number of Antler Chairs in existence, living in various parts of the world, and this design has travelled with us to a number of workshops, conferences and exhibitions.\nCo-designed with Nadeem Haidary and Defne Civelekoglu, the Rocking Stool is a fun and dynamic SketchChair that shows some more design features of the system. It is a simple and sturdy stool that lives comfortably in your living room.\nAs a part of this campaign, we are also looking for people to collaborate with to create custom personalised SketchChairs.  We will work with you to refine your own one-of-a-kind original! These chairs will also be an important part of the project development, and will forever remain as initial milestones in the SketchChair collection.\nUsing the program, anybody will be able to export files to make SketchChairs.  On SketchChair.cc people will be able to send designs to an online digital manufacturing service such as ponoko.com.  Alternatively these files could also be sent to a local community workshop such as those listed on 100kgarages.com.  After the parts are cut using a cnc router or laser cutter, they can be affordably posted as a flat package and then assembled by you at home.\nMiniatures?\nTo say thank you for supporting the SketchChair project, for each $25 you pledge you can choose one from of a series of laser-cut SketchChair prototype miniatures.  We\u2019ll send you the parts for your numbered original, which you can assemble just like the real thing.  \nGo to SketchChair.cc/minis for more images and descriptions of these designs!\nFor special recognition as a contributor, higher pledges can choose to receive a mystery SketchChair miniature, each designed by us for you as a unique original collectable.\nWe see a lot of potential in SketchChair as an engaging educational tool for introducing digital manufacturing processes and computational design.  Whether cutting the parts on an inexpensive cnc paper cutter or with trusty scissors, SketchChair is a great  hands-on activity for conducting design experiments.\nTo promote SketchChair as a teaching tool we are offering \u2018educator kits\u2019 as pledge rewards.  These include the complete series of laser-cut miniatures and a promotional poster demonstrating the SketchChair process.  You will also be registered as an educator within the SketchChair.cc community, which will entitle you to special support from us once the software is released and you want to use it in the classroom.\nWhy Sketch Chairs?\nThis project was started at the JST ERATO Design User Interface Project in Tokyo.  This is a research lab that has a focus on building systems that engage end users with the design process, with the aims of fostering creativity and promoting product individualisation.\nWe\u2019re really excited about tools that include the end user in the design process!  These give people the opportunity to enrich, and have a more personal relationship with the products that they buy, and we hope that this individuality and adaptability will also make SketchChairs less disposable, and therefore more sustainable.\nWe hope that you are excited about SketchChair too and can help us make these customisable, open-source products a reality!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #19", "update_userinfo": "SketchChair Beta is out, freely available, and open-source!", "update_content": "SketchChair Beta is out in the wild!

From a basic breakdown of taxing and spending to a detailed look at the future costs of Social Security and Medicare, Visual Budget digs deep into the data that should guide our country\u2019s policy and helps everyone to understand these issues in plain terms. And we don\u2019t leave you alone in a sea of data; Visual Budget is guided by a voice-over host who helps make sense of it all, even when the issues get complex.\nOur prototype will answer three important questions:\nWhere does my tax money go?\nWho pays what in income tax?\nHow is the budget deficit paid for?\nAnd the final website will answer these and many more.\nInspired by Motion Graphics, Powered by Open Data\nA lot of the budgetary information that will drive Visual Budget is already \u201cout there\u201d in public databases, but it isn\u2019t enough to have raw information merely accessible by the public.

Several re-writes later and the project has become a tribute to classic films like The Evil Dead, Friday the 13th and The Texas Chain Saw Massacre.\nThe film is to be shot using the Canon XL-H1 hi-definition camcorder, implementing a gritty style similar to films likes 28 Days Later and Open Water. Having a minimal number of actors will significantly cut costs, so the script has only four main characters. Most scenes will occur at three locations, a diner, a motel and an auto repair shop, all of which will be carefully shot to look like they're near each other. Filming is scheduled to take place throughout July of 2011\nThis film is designed to please fans of the horror genre. If it isn\u2019t made, moviegoers everywhere will be deprived of this bone chilling experience!\nOur mission is to produce a feature-length cult classic with such impact that it becomes broadly promoted by word-of-mouth alone.\nMost of our budget is secured, but we\u2019re trying to scrape together a little extra for some better equipment. Your generous donations will go toward light-stands, microphones, cables and other odds & ends that will aid in making this film aesthetically pleasing. In other words, you\u2019ll be responsible for the quality of this movie. Hopefully we\u2019ll surpass our goal, but no matter what we raise, this film will be made.

You will be able to create unlimited designs, with multiple colors, using authentic vintage wood type and art cuts. And you can print your design directly from LetterMpress or save it as an image for import it into other applications.\nSo why bother re-creating what\u2019s considered to be an obsolete process for the new technology of the iPad?\nActually, a letterpress and an iPad operate similarly when it comes to manipulating objects in a composition. Just like placing blocks of wood type on a surface, you drag the type images across the iPad, and then move them around to create your design. This is why the iPad would make an ideal platform for people to experience the creative aspects of letterpress and typography.\nA growing interest in letterpress\u2014but difficult to access\nIn fact, letterpress has had a growing interest over the past decade amongst designers, artists, and printmakers. Call it a reaction to the \u201cperfect\u201d look of laser-printing. Letterpress\u2014especially wood type\u2014evokes a handcrafted appearance that accompanies thoughtful, visual, and literal expression.\nBut unfortunately, much of the letterpress\u2019s traditional technology was sold for scrap metal and replaced with computers over the last 30 years. Wood type was burned, thrown in a landfill, or divided up as knick-knacks in antique and craft shops. The destruction of manual presses and thousands of type collections has made the tools of letterpress a scarce resource these days. What\u2019s left of traditional letterpress machines, wood type, and printing paraphernalia now fetch premium collector prices because of the growing interest in this art. And complete sets of wood type are rare\u2014bidding wars drive up the prices to several hundreds of dollars.\nOur goal: Our goal is to give designers, artists, students, lovers of type\u2014anyone\u2014the ability to produce their own authentic letterpress designs and artwork. And that\u2019s where this project starts and where we need your help!\nCurrent feedback: We\u2019ve shown our prototype to letterpress printers, designers, and artists, and they are just as excited as we are about this project!\nNEEDED: Beautiful wood type\u2014for everyone\nBut to make LetterMpress truly beneficial to a creative audience, we need to offer an outstanding collection of authentic wood type and vintage \u201ccuts.\u201d We have a supporter who\u2019s willing to part with a substantial portion of a historic collection purchased from type foundries and print shops when they closed in the \u201970s and \u201980s.\nThe amount we need and how we will use the funds: To acquire this collection, we need to raise at least $15,000. Along with these rare, complete collections of wood type, additional funds will also allow us to get help creating the high-resolution photos and scans of the wood type and their corresponding impressions.\nThe type that we aquire will be housed at a new letterpress co-op called the \"Living Letter Press.\" This co-op will be a resource to designers, artists, students, and anyone interested in learning letterpress.\nThe end product is just the start\nPricing LetterMpress: We want to make LetterMpress accessible to all, and plan to price it at $5.99 for the base iPad version. We plan to include at least 12 typefaces, and about 50 art \"cuts,\" to which we will add to as we update the app. Pricing for other platforms will be determined by the amount of functionality and size of files generated. Why we need the physical type: Having access to the physical types is a critical part of a later stage* of the LetterMpress venture, which will be to offer authentic letterpress prints from the designs submitted by LetterMpress users. Think about it: Wouldn't it be great to get -real- letterpress prints from your own designs?\nHelp us make this happen!\nWith your support, we hope to make LetterMpress a creative resource for designers, artists, students, and anyone who wants to experience the art, craft, and tradition of letterpress.\nWhat you get in return: To show our appreciation for your pledge, we\u2019re offering some great rewards including participation in our beta program, limited edition letterpress art prints, wood type, and the opportunity to name your own typeface in the LetterMpress App.\nCheck out the list of rewards to see what best suits you.

Along with editing our documentary we are now working on our new startup, KinWins.com. \nWe wanted to motivate other young people to go into entrepreneurship so we grabbed a video camera and bought ourselves a one way ticket to the United States. We traveled to New York and San Francisco and met lots of amazing people along the way. \nWe came in to contact with everything from young people starting out for the first time with their office in their bedroom at their parents house, to successful entrepreneurs sitting in an office with a view over the San Francisco skyline. \nOf course we also had all kinds of adventures along the way. Getting lost in the New York subway system, getting questioned by the Google Police for trying to sneak into the Google cafeteria on a food hunt (who knew that they have their own police force wearing intimidating Google uniforms) and sweating through an interview after doing a marathon sprint across Central Park to get there on time. \nIn Europe we traveled to London, Berlin, Stockholm and Copenhagen. The adventures continued. Late night parties with the crazy London start-up people, an embarrassing moment when a little language misunderstanding made us think we were speakers not bloggers at a conference in Stockholm and when we were suddenly elevated to the roles of rockstars during a Berlin start-up brunch.\nOverall we met some amazing and inspirational people and have around 70 interviews to put together in a feature length documentary.

We are going to make an amazing film, which is both aesthetically gorgeous, compelling in story, and stunning in both written and spoken dialog.\nOnce we finish the film, we are going to seek both distribution and theatrical success to get the cast and crew placed firmly on the map in an acknowledgement of their collected talents.\nWHAT'S IT ABOUT?\nVillanelle is \"Horror-Noir\" in it's purest sense. What exactly does that mean? Well, \"Horror-Noir\" is a genre that combines the grit, feel, and snappy dialog of a Mickey Spillane type detective drama, and combines it with the suspense, terror, and supernatural elements that used to make horror so much fun! In this sense, it revitalizes and holds true to two time tested genres.\nVillanelle tells the story of a hard drinking but honorable, down on his luck detective, Travis Burke, who after a storied career taking down high profile criminals in Boston, has an, \"indiscretion\", and gets exiled to the township of New Shoreham, where he's made Chief of Police. Old habits die hard for Chief Burke, who is pulled back into his old school sense of justice when he's approached by Dawn, a beautiful creature who's been attacked, and left for dead.\nWHAT DO WE NEED TO MAKE VILLANELLE?\nWell, to be perfectly honest, we need money. Film making is expensive if you want to do it right. Villanelle is no exception. First of all, we have an amazing cast and crew (both professionals and awesome friends who are donating their time to the project). Secondly, we couldn't ask for better locations than the ones we already have in place (We got REALLY lucky). The main backdrop and principle base of locations is New Shoreham, RI, also known as Block Island.\nUnlike Rhode Island, Block island is an actual island. The only way to reach it is by ferry, and let me tell you, it's not cheap when you need to get a full cast and crew out there four or five times. Beyond that, there are the costs of additional equipment to make our camera guys lives easier, and the finished product amazing. We are shooting on the Canon 7D, which is a film quality camera, but needs some bells and whistles in order to tap it's full potential.\nCosts on films, even ones made for little money, can spiral out of control if you aren't realistic. We've attempted to come up with the realistic breakdown, but there's always something you miss.\nHere's a breakdown of what your donations are going towards...\n** Ferry Fees for Cast and Crew ** Color Correction and Visual Effects ** Food and Beverages ** Professional Sound Mixing ** Musical Score and Soundtrack ** Camera Accessories ** Practical Effects ** Gas Money for the Cast and Crew ** Festival Fees\nSO WAIT. WHY USE KICKSTARTER?\nSimply because Kickstarter represents the exact way we want to make our films; Supported by friends, family, and lovers of film. Totally independent of studios. Grass roots based, with local talent both on screen, and behind the action. In the end, we get the type of movie we want to go see in theater, and watch over again.\nIS ANYBODY GONNA SEE HOW MUCH I DONATE?\nJust us! And our lips are sealed!\nOK. I'VE DONATED. WHEN DO I GET MY DONATION INCENTIVES?\nWell. Incentives are only sent if we reach our goal. With your help we can. Once the goal is reached, we make the movie. Incentives will start flying out the door between the start and end of production (A DVD is a good example. We gotta finish the movie before we send it to you) However, our crack team of Donation Updaters will get to work the second our goal is reached, and keep you posted the whole ride through.\nCAN WE EXCEED OUR TARGETED GOAL??\nYes, yes and yes! Once we reach our goal, you can continue to donate, and let's face it, the more money, the better. Additional funds will go towards things like better editing and coloring services, better sound mixing, and things of that ilk. the more the merrier!\nWHAT HAPPENS IF THE MONEY ISN'T RAISED IN TIME?\nNo one gets anything and no money is exchanged. Meaning we don't get to live our dream, you don't get to be part of something awesome, and it turns into a really boring situation. I don't think we should collectively allow this to happen!\nSO, DO YOU HAVE A WEBSITE?\nIt's in development. Our Art department is working their tails off and quite frankly, hasn't got around to it. We plan to launch the site by the start of production. In the meantime, here'a a link to our Facebook group where you can see the stars of the film, read a little something about it, and stay up to date on press for the film!\nhttp://www.facebook.com/pages/Villanelle/196433450371791", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #58", "update_userinfo": "Villanelle Selected As One Of Wizard Studios First Three Releases!", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #57", "update_userinfo": "DVD/ BluRay Update", "update_content": "It's been a long wait, but in preparation for the 1st screening on August 18th, we proudly present the official Villanelle trailer.

To view the full 20-minute short for free, please visit Gametrailers.com.\nTHE BEGINNING: Over the past year, the computer game Minecraft has become a cultural phenomenon, drawing millions of players into the unique, low-res world created solely by Swedish programmer Markus \"Notch\" Persson. When Persson announced that he would invest his Minecraft earnings in founding his own development house, Mojang Specifications, 2 Player Productions seized upon the rare opportunity to fly to Sweden and document the first week in the life of the new studio.\nDuring the editing process of what was only supposed to be a twenty-minute short, it became clear that an important chapter of gaming history was still being written, and that a feature-length documentary about Mojang's first year would make a powerful statement about what it means to create, release, and play games in the twenty-first century.\nTHE FILM: For the first time, viewers will be given an in-depth look at both the triumphs and the challenges faced by a studio during their first year in existence. We will analyze the unprecedented success of Minecraft, gain insight into its impact from journalists and industry professionals, and meet the fans whose lives have been changed by the game.\n\u201cMinecraft: The Story of Mojang\u201d would represent 2 Player Productions\u2019 second foray into feature films (following 2008\u2019s critically-acclaimed \u201cReformat the Planet\u201d) and is part of our ongoing mission to examine and celebrate the zeitgeist of contemporary gaming culture.\nTHE PLAN: Your investment will allow us to make frequent visits to the Mojang office in Sweden and other locations around the globe throughout 2011. Support would also allow us to enrich the film by hiring additional crew to handle post-production effects, audio engineering, an original musical score, and the production and shipment of unique Backer rewards. To incentivize donations, we are reuniting with merchandising team Fangamer to produce a wide variety of exciting products -- all of them exclusive to this four-week campaign period.\nThroughout the production, we\u2019ll maintain a project blog about the film\u2019s progress and post plenty of photos and bonus videos.

It tells the story of a not too distant future where there has been a harsh economic down turn. The 'everyman' of our story; Moder, has been out of work for quite some time and is waiting for a solution to come along his way. He puts his faith in the government to fix his life-- when just that happens: in the form of a job stimulus plan for the American people. Moder gets handed a new job at a new factory... yet; the work, the results, and the effects are not what anyone had in mind. Dramatic, hysterically funny, and still poignant: the story of Moder is an important one for our times.\nThe process for \"Moder\" will be the most elaborate I have ever undertaken for an animated short film. It was previously not possible to take the next step creatively because of a lack of resources, which, you can help change. We will be filming completely original live action for our animation sequences, designing elaborate matte paintings for backgrounds, and sculpting original puppets for the claymation sequences. All of these materials, and processes can be extremely expensive, however, thanks to an integrated process originated by Jimi Patterson and the help of state of the art equipment; the process has been streamlined and made incredibly independent in nature. What used to take a team of animators will now be done by one. The 2,200 is a relatively small fee when considering the elements.\nThe short film is a criticism of the faith people put in big government to solve their problems. It's also a criticism of what it actually means to create according to ability, yet take according to need. The hope of this film is to inspire debate about what the role of government really is in society, and most importantly, ask the question: what should individuals hold as their highest value while working? Does doing a job that you love, mean you'll never work a day in your life? It seems today people are ready to sacrifice them selves to any and all causes without any moral principal involved-- is this a good or bad thing? Ultimately the film is suppose to spur debate, and celebrate the lost art of 2D animation.\nNote to prospective. donors: If you are considering a contribution for my artistic endeavor, I would like to state that no individual should feel any obligation to donate on any grounds other than voluntary intent to see the film made. As incentive to donate there are 'rewards,' which are negotiable (if a donor has an idea for a reward that I have not included, this can be discussed via email.) I only encourage donations if the donor is in a position of financial comfortability. If you can't pay your rent, or your phone bill, please do not consider donating, I 100% understand your situation. However, if you are in a position to donate, and looking for a capable artist in need of monetary support to realize an important achievement, by all means, click donate now and make a $500 contribution.

Romero.\nWHERE IS YOUR MONEY GOING? While Tom Savini has been and continues to be supportive of the project, the film has primarily been self financed.

Unfortunately, most of his attempts to go outside in the world generally result in injury. For a boy made of paper, he is especially and predictably delicate. This greatly hinders his ability to make friends.\nEmile is a dance prodigy and spends most hours of the day in the studio. His ballet company prepares for an upcoming production, and Emile pushes himself to the limit practicing.\nBy chance, Arthur gets a glimpse of Emile dancing and becomes irrevocably fascinated by his skill and drive. When Emile injures his leg, the two become close friends. Arthur stays with Emile in the hospital, and after Emile recovers, he tries to show Arthur that the world can be a safe and exciting place.\nHowever, the boys learn that not everyone is ready to accept Arthur, and in the end, Emile must make a dramatic decision about how much their friendship means to him.\nTHE PROJECT\nThe Paper Prince will be a short film shot on Super 16mm (or 16mm, TBD) thanks to an amazing donation from KODAK and the Dodge College of Film and Media Arts. Due to the fact that it is my final thesis project, the school will also be providing all of the equipment for free. Therefore, I am very grateful to have the opportunity to pursue and finish this project by the end of spring.\nAs for Arthur specifically, I am hoping to make a larger-than-life-size, realistic paper head for an actor to wear. I will also make paper hands so that Arthur will appear to be made entirely from paper. With computer graphics added in post-production, Arthur will have responsive facial expressions, and cinematically, will be a living, active character (who happens to be made from paper).\nTHE PEOPLE\nI'm lucky to have so many talented people also involved in this project. Please look them up because they're all unbearably gifted! :)\nSPECIAL EFFECTS ARTIST : Andrew Finch 3D ARTIST : Matt Vana SOUND DESIGN : Andrew Swanson aka St. Andrew MUSIC COMPOSER : Daniel Kaufman aka Plant Magic Man COLORIST : Greg Cotten PRODUCER : Ossie Kishlanski CINEMATOGRAPHER : Jordan Black EDITOR : Sean Shao Chi Yap PRODUCTION DESIGN : Joseph Carnegie SCRIPT SUPERVISOR : Natalie Walters CHOREOGRAPHERS : Zak Ryan Schlegel and Jamie Donovan\nTHE FINANCES\nI am funding most of this film myself (with the money I have happily set away since high school). The total cost will be about $5000. Half of the funding will go towards bringing Arthur to life. It will pay for the digital effects team as well as the 3D artist modeling the paper head. The rest will go towards paying for locations and paying the set teacher (with child actors, safety is especially important, next to fun and games).\nTHE REWARDS\nYour support, literally, means everything because without it, everything about this project would not exist. Please take a look at the rewards offered (to the right), and hopefully you'll find something that interests you (beyond just the project). I am also open to suggestions, so if there is something you especially want out of supporting this project, please let me know! :)\nKICKSTARTER (and why you might/might not care)\nKickstarter allows for an amazing opportunity and platform to not only reach people potentially interested in The Paper Prince but also to support other great artists and creators. If you have any questions about Kickstarter, please go here : https://www.kickstarter.com/help/faq\nKickstarter allows for all-or-nothing funding, so if The Paper Prince does not reach its goal in time, you won't be charged. It is a great way to get people to be involved and excited about this project.\nIf this is a story you're interested in and would want to see succeed as a film, I happily (and gratefully) invite you to be a part of the process.\nI am excited to do all that I can to make this project happen, and with your support, I have no doubts that it will.\nThank you so much for everything (especially for reading until this point).", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #7", "update_userinfo": "Wrapped on Principal Photography", "update_content": "As of today, we are officially wrapped on principal photography for The Paper Prince.

With her trusty companion Old Sock by her side, she deals with the nightmare in her own unique way. Our film combines old school camera techniques with high production values in a story that will, dare we say it, blow your mind.  We're aiming for a Sundance festival premiere.\nWHAT WE'RE DOING We\u2019re raising money to resume production and finish our film. Though we planned carefully, we were taken off guard by the actual cost of shooting our exterior scenes at night, in the woods, with a large crew. Moving into interiors, we realize that we need the support of beautiful people like you to make this thing happen.\nWHY WE'RE DOING IT A solid film starts with a solid story. This weird little monster of a script was so well received, by men and women alike, that we chose it to be the first Atomic Puppy Studios film. As you can see by the dailies in the video above, every department has brought a level of excellence that transcends our budget limitations, all for the love of the art, and the opportunity to collaborate and create something truly different and special. Your generous support will give us the resources we need to finish what we started, and validate the hard work and dedication of our tireless talent and crew.\nWHAT IS KICKSTARTER? Kickstarter uses the \"crowdfunding\" concept to enable the many to reach the few. Even if you can't contribute much, your money goes really far when enough people get involved. Folks who contribute a bit more get some pretty nice incentives for being awesome, supporting the arts, and truly making a difference through direct involvement with artists like us :)\nEVERY LITTLE BIT HELPS. We have a lot to raise in a short period of time. If you know others who dig weird, wonderful, dark stuff, please let them know about us. Thank you so much!\nTHE INCENTIVES are cascading. You get everything from the lower donor tiers when you donate to the project at a particular level.\nThat means, for example, that for $100.00, you get your name on the website, a PDF of the final shooting script, an electronic press kit, a hard copy of the shooting script with director\u2019s notes and shot sheets, your freakin' name in the end credits, an autographed photo, a signed poster, a DVD, and a limited edition T-Shirt. That's a big whoppin' pile of sweet swag, in addition to being a patron of the arts and an all around fabulous person. And you ARE fabulous, but then, you probably already knew that.\nImage by Alatus Photography\n---------------------- FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS ----------------------\nWHAT WILL YOU DO WITH THE FINISHED FILM? Exhibit at major U.S. and international film festivals.\nWHAT IF YOU DON'T HIT THE KICKSTARTER GOAL BY THE DEADLINE? When you contribute, Kickstarter holds the funds in escrow until the target date. If we don\u2019t hit our goal by then, Kickstarter returns the money, the production gets nothing, and we\u2019re back to square one with no cash at all. Yikes.\nWHAT IF YOU RAISE MORE MONEY THEN YOU'RE ASKING FOR? That would be amazing. The more we raise, the stronger the film becomes, as every dime will be spent on production. A few projects on Kickstarter have blown out their goals considerably. We\u2019d love to be in their company.\nCAN I INCREASE MY PLEDGE ONCE IT'S BEEN MADE? You bet! Just sign in and click the \u201cManage Your Donation\u201d button to enter a new amount, or choose a new incentive.\nIS $10,000 THE ENTIRE BUDGET? Oh, heavens no. This is the amount we need to finish shooting.\nWHEN DO INCENTIVES GO OUT? Incentives will be sent after we wrap in March. We\u2019ll contact you to get info like T-Shirt size and whatnot.\nWHAT IF I DON'T CARE ABOUT THE INCENTIVES? Just click the button that lets you opt out.\nWHERE CAN I LEARN MORE ABOUT THE FILM?

After his fianc\u00e9 leaves him and his writing career tailspins he leaves New York City to reconcile with his emotions and restore some sense of purpose to his life. But after reconnecting with his parents and some old friends he finds his reality slowly unraveling blurring the lines between the real and the imaginary.\nAnd as Will fights to hold on to his sanity a disturbing truth begins to emerge.\nA BIT MORE... This 15-minute short film explores several topics having elements of science fiction, drama, insanity and fear. At the forefront is the bleak depiction of a near, post-2012 future where the mind is evolving but society is beginning to crumble. At the core is much more personal story of a man looking to escape the fears and anxieties of his life, his relationships, and his responsibilities as an adult. But he soon realizes that we cannot escape the consequences of the choices we make.\nThis short story is also an ancillary piece to a much larger tale. We hope this short film will generate enough momentum to continue to develop the full-length feature story.\nPROJECT LOCATION New York, NY Putnam and Westchester County, NY\nYOUR DONATIONS\nWHAT IS THE MONEY FOR / WHO DOES IT GO TO?

Thanks for checking out our project, \"The Perks of Writing a Musical.\" With your help, we would like to make our vision a realilty and launch one of the most ambitious web shows on the Internet. \"The Perks of Writing a Musical\" is a new scripted musical web show. Glee meets Wii.\nI'm very excited to be working on a web show. Web shows have been called the last great entertainment frontier of our lifetime - a Wild West of Possibilities! You can help us make \"The Perks of Writing a Musical\" a possibility.\n\"The Perks of Writing a Musical\" is an up-beat, feel-good musical to cheer us up during down-turned times. We want your support to create a show filled with charming characters, wonderful stories, great acting, first-rate production values - including an amazing musical video. It's the kind of show they'll be talking about at the virtual water cooler for years to come.\n\"The Perks of Writing a Musical\" is about the youthful world of teen-aged gamers, what makes them play, love, and create. It's about the challenges of true intimacy in a tech-driven world and and the transformative nature of art.\nWe've drawn our creative team from Hollywood's independent film world and the Broadway community. Creator Tom Diggs' work was recently nominated for the Pulitzer Prize for Drama. Director Bill Oliver is AFI alum and has worked for Paramount and SONY. Cinematographer David Kagen comes to us from True Blood, Entourage and The Green Hornet. Composer Jason Michael Snow is currently in the Book of Mormom on Broadway. Lyricist Misha Faucher is a favorite at the prestigious BMI Musical Theatre Workshop where she and Jason often collaborate. And we've cast an amazing, charismatic group of actor-singers - including Alex Wyse, Allison Strong, and Paul Cereghino - check them out in our video. In the end, we're just a crew of indie creative types who like to create cool stuff. We believe this is going to be a great musical web show!\nSo here's where you come in. We're raising money to produce the kind of pilot episode the world can't help but fall in love with. We were originally going to shoot it all guerilla style with iphones and Flip cameras, but the musical production number renders that impossible. Everyone above the line (directors, actors, writers) is donating their time and talent. However, \"below the line\" production costs (including pre- and post-) aren't donated as easily. Still, we have been able to slash a $50,000 budget down to a workable $12,000 to create the best production possible.\nOUR PROMISE: Principal Casting completed: Feb. 15, 2011 Song recorded: Feb. 20, 2011 Shooting wrapped: March 27, 2011 Launched by May 15, 2011. We're registered to launch on blip.tv, youtube, as well as www.theperksofwritingamusical.com\nEveryone who donates at least $10 gets a shooting script of the pilot episode signed by the cast and creative team. $25 dollars gets you a CD of the pilot episode song, \"She Doesn't Know My Name,\" also signed. Every cent donated will go into the budget of the pilot.

I am extremely excited to share that test screenings have been positive with great constructive feedback.  Everyone involved with the project is proud that the film has generated great praise for the incredible singing, dancing and acting.\nWe will soon be moving into the realm of scoring and sound work.  This stage of post-production is where the experts really give the film its final polish. \nWe are seeking finishing funds to help us in the following areas:\n- live orchestration for the score\n- post-production house services for sound design, sound editing and final mixing\n- DVD duplications for screeners\n- Film Festival fees\nOur Kickstarter video details how integral having live orchestrations are for a musical film.  I've also included exclusive sneak peeks to some of the songs from the film to wet your appetite with.  Words cannot express how much having this element added to the film will bring this film to life.  Having the sound elements worked on by a professional post-production facility will ensure the quality of the film is maintained -- so that audiences will be immersed into the full experience of the film.\nPlease check out the right hand side of this page to review all the rewards available. We are truly grateful for any amount you are able to donate.

Every little bit helps and goes a long way. From a donation to simply just letting your friends know about this campaign via word-of-mouth to Facebook and Twitter, it all means a lot to us. With your belief in us I know we can do it.\nKickstarter has been nothing but amazing to our film and to the indie film community.  Since our previous campaign, I have really enjoyed donating to other crowdfunding projects and continue to do so whenever possible.  It is what's keeping the dream alive for many artists. \nThank you for your continued love and support for me and everyone involved with this project.  We sincerely mean it when we say we couldn't do it without you.

The Split Strap project was successfully funded on Kickstarter. Come visit us at CustomSLR.com to check out our latest news, updates and products.\nHello there! Thank you for stopping by our project. With your support, we hope to distribute a better carrying experience to as many people possible worldwide and even create a new standard in carrying strap comfort!\nWe were inspired to improve poorly designed straps that fail to address the basic anatomical needs of our bodies. Most straps are uncomfortable since they do not distribute weight effectively.\nSplit Strap is our patent pending solution to this conundrum. We engineered the Split Strap concept from the ground up while integrating as many favorable features as possible by using data we collected from research on the human anatomy.\nThe Split Strap is designed and developed with maximum ergonomics and comfort in mind.\nAfter studying how straps interact with the structures of the shoulder, neck, and back, we discovered that the planar/flat profiled nature of existing straps did not contour to the body well causing unequal weight/force distribution, discomfort and possible strain.\nOur breakthrough design utilizes a split in the strap which creates multiple points where the strap could sit and conform to the body; thus, distributing the weight evenly and increasing comfort. The split also promotes cooling by venting heat away.\nOn the backside of the strap, we integrated sticky silicone printed logos that reduce annoying slippage.\nThe rotating quick release buckle reduces strap tension by pivoting with the movements of the user, which decreases chaffing and increases slack to facilitate further flexibility and comfort.\nWe hope to have the Split Straps for the various applications available by mid-March. The Kickstarter pre-order prices include shipping in the US and is lower than the expected retail price.\nThank you for your support!\nHow do I pre-order more than 1 strap? If you would like to order more than one strap simply choose a pledging option and add the extra amount. For example, if you want one camera strap and one arm sling, the total will be $22 + $30 for a total pledge amount of $52. All straps will come complete. So if you order two you will be receiving two complete straps (not just additional attachments).\nI don't live in the US. How do I add additional shipping? The extra shipping fees are $3 for Canada and $8 for International - simply add this amount to your pledge amount. _________________________________________\nHere are the Split Straps that will be available.\nGliding Split Strap for Cameras The gliding Split Strap is designed to make it easy to draw the camera from your side.

We're very grateful. And of course exceeding our goal would allow us to provide even deeper and broader coverage of art's history!\nWHAT IS SMARTHISTORY? Smarthistory.org is a Webby-award winning, free and open educational resource for the study of art history. Smarthistory was created by two art historians, Beth Harris and Steven Zucker, each with twenty years of teaching experience, who saw an opportunity to use conversation and the web to make art history accessible to their students. The Smarthistory website currently covers more than 300 works of art and is fast becoming a viable alternative to the commercial textbook. Visit Smarthistory.org. WHO USES SMARTHISTORY, AND WHY In 2010, Smarthistory.org was visited more than half a million times by visitors from more than 150 countries. Nearly one hundred universities, libraries and museums now recommend Smarthistory and instructors are increasingly adopting it in place of the expensive survey textbook. Even if you\u2019re not a college student, Smarthistory is a great resource, and we want to keep it that way. WHY WE NEED YOUR HELP We have so much great content -- but we need to create at least 100 more videos in order for Smarthistory to be a truly viable alternative to the survey textbook. Every $100 contribution from you makes one more video possible. And because Smarthistory.org is a 501(c)3 organization, your contribution may also be tax-deductible (please consult your tax advisor). WHAT PEOPLE ARE SAYING ABOUT SMARTHISTORY Some recent press... Brainpickings Democratizing Art History. Traditionally, the study of art history has belonged to the privileged. Tuition-rich courses, overpriced textbooks, trips to museums (often across vast oceans) \u2014 they all cost a pretty penny. [...]Smarthistory is perhaps the most centralized effort to make art history an accessible field. The Huffington Post Given the efficiency of the site's schematic and the wellspring of accurate and interesting information it provides, it's easy to understand why Smarthistory.org is rapidly becoming a favorite of would-be art historians on college campuses everywhere. Chronicle of Higher Education Smarthistory, begun in 2005, gets about 65,000 visits a month, up about 60 percent over last year. It won the Webby award for best education Web site in 2009.

Protei combines conventional technologies in an innovative design that we can implement in the short term to address timely environmental crisis such as the BP Oil Spill, cleaning the ocean gyre garbage patches or performing ocean research. We need your help to build our next prototype of Protei - the first articulated sailing boat that can tack upwind pulling a long heavy payload and initiating a revolutionary family in ocean robotics. http://protei.org \nA situation we must change \nCurrent Oil spill skimming technology was able to collect only 3% of the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill. The health of remediation workers was compromised by exposure to cancerous toxic chemicals, skimming boats themselves contributed to pollution and were expensive to power, operations were constrained by daily weather conditions and were limited by proximity to the coast. In contrast, Protei aims to be : unmanned, unrestrained by human biological needs; green and affordable; self-righting and therefore operable even in hurricane conditions; semi-autonomous, so that far offshore, many Protei would be able to intelligently and continuously swarm.\nObservations and ideas from testing \n Spilled oil moves downwind from its source following surface currents. Traditional oil skimmers pull oil-absorbent booms and trace random linear paths in a sea of oil. But a better way to capture this oil is to sail upwind, intercepting the oil sheens traveling downwind. Protei harnesses the wind in order to power an unmanned sailing drone, pulling a long oil-absorbent \u2018tail\u2019 upwind. A fleet of many Protei will work automatically as a swarm, or be remotely controlled by coastal residents and on-line gamers.\nWhen you pull a long heavy object behind a traditional sailboat, the center of gravity is altered such that in order to preserve navigability it becomes necessary to redesign the relationship of hull, keel, and rudder. The solution we found is to design an entirely articulated sailing boat that curves when it tacks upwind. Building and testing consecutive prototypes with multiple sails, we soon realized that Protei's hull bending would expose both sides of the vessel to the wind when tacking upwind, continuously catching wind with the different sails, increasing power and control - and creating a totally new way of sailing! We also found out that an inflatable body would make Protei featherweight for a very large sail surface : an excellent power ratio. Inflatable means also cheaper and collision-safe. Version after version, we keep improving the design and discovering new properties. \nVersions  \n - Protei_001 : front steering, Remote Controlled. \n - Protei_002 : articulated sailboat, Remote Controlled. \n - Protei_003 : articulated inflatable sailboat, lightweight and larger sail surface, good power ratio. - Protei_004 : electric, swarm for display, art. \n - Protei_005 : electronic, on-board sensors and micro-chip control, wireless real-time communication and monitored with webcam to analyze trajectory. \nWhat the money is for   \n- Protei_006 : We need money to build our next prototype at full scale to measure the performances : * how much oil can be absorbed. * how much floating plastic debris we can collect from the ocean garbage patches. * how much weight of scientific payload we can transport for ocean studies and exploration. This next prototype will be packed with electronics and sensors: micro-controllers, GPS, long range wireless communication, solar panel, wind turbine, accelerometers, anemometer, pressure gauges, batteries, servo/step motors, winches etc. Many of us will gather 3 months this summer in Rotterdam (Netherlands) to build our next prototype and publish the full online documentation so others can build their own versions too. \nDeploy \nOil spills are happening all the time across the world. In many of these locations, access to effective yet inexpensive remediation technology is lacking. Thus, Protei is Open Hardware so anyone can use, modify, and distribute Protei. Currently Protei is being developed as a team effort by Open_Sailing in the UK and France, V2_ in the Netherlands, randomwalks in South Korea, Amorphica in the US and Mexico and contributors from all around the world. If you cannot back us, you can work with us :)\nProtei is the plural for Proteus, Greek sea-god and son of Poseidon. Proteus was known for his mutability, his capability of assuming many forms. The word protean evokes flexibility, versatility and adaptability. The machine we are developing now is Protei for collecting spilled oil at sea, but being an open source project, other versions may be designed in the future for other purposes : to harvest the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, to capture heavy metal pollutants in coastal areas, extract toxic contaminants from urban waterways, perform oceanographic research, monitor marine life etc.\nWe hope that developing Protei Open Hardware will contribute to ocean studies and pollution remediation. Help us build our next prototype. Thank you!\nShare our website: https://sites.google.com/a/opensailing.net/protei/ Our video : http://www.youtube.com/watch...

Think back to the days of all nighters during finals week, add the passion of global hope and hearts changed, all the while waking up to the snowy peaks of the Rocky Mountains. For 21 days, 4 documentary gurus at the top of their game in the film industry will be sitting in a room staring at computer screens with empty energy drinks all over the floor. Their hair un-kept and flying all over the place, looking like Albert Einstein, with big grins on their faces because they know that what they are making is going to inspire and instill hope on those who see what they have created.\nWhat is being edited? MOVING ON (www.MovingOnMovie.com) is a feature-length film we have been working on for the past year to show the world that Africa is changing us and everyone who bids to enter in. We are inches away from finishing the feature length Rough Cut. You are invited to help us complete this project so we can help spread hope to the world.\nWhat is this all about? Hope is winning for the people of Africa and we want you to experience it too! Who knew this would all start by the adoption of our daughter? Who knew that the people we work with in Uganda through our non-profit Light Gives Heat (www.lightgivesheat.org) would change us and mold us into the people that we are today? Everyone that has come on board with us as staff or volunteers has been changed and inspired by the hope we see in Africa. MOVING ON recently won Grand Prize in Panasonic's 'Shoot It, Share It' contest - it's a huge honor, check it out. ~FAQs~ Is MOVING ON a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization? YES. The film is a project of Light Gives Heat, a certified 501(c)3 non-profit organization. ALL PLEDGES ARE TAX-DEDUCTIBLE and LGH will provide a receipt for the 2011 tax year!\nWhere does this money go and where can it take us? All of the money (aside from Kickstarter fees/incentives) will go directly towards our 21-day MOVING ON Edit-a-thon and ensure that a rough-cut of the film will be completed by March 23rd, 2011. After the rough-edit is done, we still will have more editing, animation, music licensing/creation, and other post-production magic, but this $10,000 is part of the $25,000 Light Gives Heat is trying to raise to see a rough cut finished by the end of March 2011.\n$10,000 seems like a low amount to get a rough cut of a film done... Yes, $10,000 is our Kickstarter goal, but our real needs for our MOVING ON Edit-a-thon in March 2011 are $25,000 and we will be doing other fundraising locally to help meet the additional funding goal. Up until this point, the project has been funded by gracious donors, the winnings of $20,000 through a Chase Community Giving Grant, and our initial start-up loan. The $10,000 figure is the amount we felt comfortable aiming for in Kickstarter because as you know, unless we meet our goal we don't get any of the pledges. In actuality, the $10,000 is part of a larger remaining balance of $150,000 that will allow us to fully fund the film, see it through completion, and enter it into film festivals (as well as pay back our original start-up loan). If we could generate more than $10,000 in this campaign, we would be stoked! Don't forget, with MOVING ON, we do have benefit of offering a tax-deductible receipt ;)\nHow and when will you get contact information to fulfill the incentives? If and when we successfully reach our deadline we get your email address. At this point, we will contact you for any relevant information. You\u2019ll tell us what size t-shirt to send you, who you want the SUUBI necklace mailed to, and of course- who's coming to our Rough Cut Reveal night on March 23rd, 2011! We\u2019ll send out those emails pronto, so just make sure you get back to us- the sooner we get the contact info, the sooner your prizes can ship.\nCan I increase my pledge once it\u2019s been made? YES! Once you donate to MOVING ON, you may want to change your incentive reward by increasing your pledge amount. To do so, go to Kickstarter and sign in. If you go to our campaign page, the green \u201cBack This Project\u201d button will have been replaced with a blue \u201cManage Your Donation\u201d button. Click it and you can enter a new amount, or choose a new incentive.\nWhat happens if the money isn\u2019t raised in time? This is what we\u2019re working to avoid. If we don\u2019t reach our goal then no exchange is made. You don\u2019t pay and we have to find another way to fund this film- bad news all around.\nCan we exceed the goal? YES! And honestly, we need that to happen. Again, we are just trying to get creative and the $10,000 figure is part of a $25,000 goal we have for the month of March 2011 and our MOVING ON Edit-a-thon. So, the pledges can keep on rolling in, even after our goal is met, until our deadline- February 28th.\nWhen will the film release? We get asked all the time, and trust us when we say that we want to know a release date more than anybody! The reality is that this production has turned into something bigger and more beautiful than we anticipated - which is a good thing. Our goal is a finalized film in summer 2011 and to do the Film Festival circuit with hopes of releasing to the public in Spring/Summer 2012. This is long-term thinking, we know, but since this a collaboration, YOU can help play an essential role and the truth is WE NEED YOU!\nAny other questions?

We are software hackers and music producers who grew up learning on simple tools like Fruityloops. We aren't aiming to build the world's most complex audio sequencer, we wish to create a simple tool that the next generation of software developers and musicians can learn from. Think Fruityloops, but in a web-page and multiple users can edit the same song at once.\nThis sounds like a very complex technical goal to achieve, but we have already completed a working prototype which won Best Collaborative Hack at NYC Music Hack Day 2011. JSONloops has been mentioned on TechCrunch, The New York Observer, and CreateDigitalMusic.com. We've gotten a tremendous amount of positive feedback and even more requests to release JSONloops as a full fledged open-source project.\nOlder video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSZLLgel6Gs\nOpen JSON format\nJSONloops songs are composed entirely in JSON. JSON is a widely used plaintext format for storing and exchanging data on the web. It is the standard which services like Google, Twitter, Flickr, and Facebook utilize for sharing and receiving data. JSON is supported by every modern programming language to date.\nA JSONloops server emits and can receive a standard JSON message on every step of the sequencer. This means that a developer could easily write software in any language to extend JSONloops. It also means that songs can be remixed and edited using existing tools, or even just a plain text editor!\nThe Community\nWhile developing a functional piece of software is critical, it's also very important to us that we build a vibrant open community around the project. We know from experience, that community is one the pillars of success in any open-source software project.\nWhy are we asking for money?\nWe need funding for software development costs. JSONloops is open-source, but it will require hundreds, if not thousands of hours of software development to reach a stable version (v.1.0.0 in semantic versioning ). Aside from the core team of developers, we plan to hire a series of \"open-source\" interns to work on the project. This small amount of funding will allow us to accelerate the pace of development for the project, as well as give a great incentive to inspire developers to join the project. We have the experience necessary in leading open-source projects, and the network of developers ready to make this possible.\nThe Team\nMarak Squires, Elijah Insua , hij1nx Click on any team member's name or picture to see their Github open-source profile. Github is a place where open-source developers share and develop source code. We love Github!\nThe Sponsor\nThe company I work for has been very gracious in offering free hosting for the JSONloops project. This will allow us to not have to worry about paying for hosting costs! Thank you Nodejitsu, the best node.js hosting provider ever!\nWhen do you expect this to be complete?\nIf we can successfully raise enough money, we plan to release version 1.0.0 in Fall of 2011.

Can you keep the robot factory working despite the wily meddling of Tesla Ranger spies? Find out in this new game for the iPod, iPad, and other mobile devices.\nMachination puts the player in the role of a would-be Evil Genius doing the fiendish bidding of the nefarious organization FAUST!\nIn the latest bid to rule the world, FAUST's devious scientists have developed a series of malevolent machines designed for the sole purpose of causing havoc. FAUST's implacable foes, the Tesla Rangers, have dispatched spies to infiltrate the organization's robot factories and disrupt production.\nNeedless to say, FAUST has other ideas. You have been instructed to keep the factory working and catch those spies! At last, a chance to rise above the ranks of other minions and prove your worth as an Evil Genius!\nIn MACHINATION, you must collect the necessary robot parts from the factory's conveyors and place them in order onto the robot blueprint. Building the correct number of robots completes a level and moves you deeper into the factory, where more complex robot orders are required, and the conveyors move ever faster! Catching the Tesla spies helps the factory run smoother, and collecting cogs allows you to acquire new devices to aid you in your task.\nWorking in the Unity engine provides us with great flexibility from project to project, and allows us to master a toolset that can be deployed on a number of platforms. Part of our funding requirement is to acquire the appropriate licenses for this versatile software. In addition, we are currently working with borrowed hardware. With your help, we\u2019ll be able to return this gear to its rightful owners and use our own. I\u2019m sure these friends will be as grateful to you for your generosity as we are.\nIn addition, we want to make sure the game is as professional as possible. The video shows our working prototype which is fully functional and has almost all the features we need to launch the game. We do need to spend time replacing the art with production quality art, and adding the level of polish needed to make a game really stand out. To this end, we will be contracting an audio expert to create our sounds and music for us (a key aspect we're missing right now). He\u2019s been incredibly generous with his time so far, but he\u2019s a professional and needs to be paid for his work. Your funding will help us to provide the most polished package we can.\nOnce the game is complete our work really begins. Making headway in the app store is a full-time job, and the only way to make a game a success is to work hard promoting it. Any marketing effort at all takes time and money, and we expect to have to work very hard indeed to rise above the general noise in the store. We are fortunate enough to have a number of friends and former colleagues who have already enjoyed tremendous success in the app store and will be able to benefit greatly from their help and experience. Part of the funding you provide will help us to get those initial first week sales necessary to get a game ranked and listed. Getting the game in front of players is crucial and we need your help to make it happen.\nObviously we think Machination is a great game or we wouldn\u2019t be asking for your help in releasing it. It is by no means our only game, however. In fact we\u2019re bursting with great ideas that we think would make awesome apps and we really want to develop that next game, and the one after that.\nBut before we can start thinking about our next project, we need to launch Machination, and for that we need your help.

More money helps us found the project stronger, reach goals faster and explore more technologies of freedom. We're proud of the Freedom Box Foundation's public roots, and we want to be able to demonstrate support and interest from as many people as possible. So thank you to everyone who has pledged so far and please, keep pledging and keep giving.\n$60K was a floor, not a ceiling. It is the minimum we need to start making this a real project, but it is not enough to fully fund the project. The more money we raise from the public, the more money we can raise from industry and grants. Even $1 donations help us prove the viability of our efforts.\nWe are right now trying to get some public attention focused on how quickly we hit $60K. So keep telling your friends about the project and the this site. We'd like to surge over the top and finish strong.\nCongratulations to us all for the collective effort we've made so far. And thanks again, for all your ideas, your time, your energy and your donations!\nWelcome web readers!\nIf you're coming from the any of the recent stories about Eben Moglen and the creation of the FreedomBox Foundation (NY Times, WSJ, BoingBoing, Slashdot, reddit, ZDNet, The New York Observer, New Europe, techPresident, etc) please check out the FreedomBox Foundation's website and read here for more information about the project.\nWhat is Freedom Box?\nFreedom Box is the name we give to a free software system built to keep your communications free and private whether chatting with friends or protesting in the street.\nFreedom Box software is particularly tailored to run in \"plug servers,\" which are compact computers that are no larger than the power adapters for electronic appliances.\nLocated in people's homes or offices such inexpensive servers can provide privacy in normal life, and safe communications for people seeking to preserve their freedom in oppressive regimes.\nWhy Freedom Box?\nBecause social networking and digital communications technologies are now critical to people fighting to make freedom in their societies or simply trying to preserve their privacy where the Web and other parts of the Net are intensively surveilled by profit-seekers and government agencies. Yet, instead of technology supporting these new modes of communications, smartphones, mobile tablets, and other common forms of consumer electronics are being built as \"platforms\" to control their users and monitor their activity.\nFreedom Box exists to provide people with privacy-respecting technology alternatives that enable normal communication in normal times, and that offer ways to collaborate safely and securely with others in building social networks of protest, demonstration, and mobilization for political change in the not-so-normal times.\nImagine if your next wireless router, or settop box, or other small computing device came with extra features. It knew how to securely contact your friends and business associates, it stored your personal data, securely backing it up and generally maintaining your presence in the various networks you have come to rely on for communicating with people in society.\nSuch a box would not only make your participation in network communication easier in your daily life, increasing your privacy and the security of computers in your life, it would have many unique advantages during times of crisis.\nSuch a box could help in disasters by creating a mesh network with your neighbors to replace the centralized internet connections that go out with the lights or are cut by hostile governments. Such a box would make it harder for governments and invasive corporate interests to reach your data and casually profile you for their own uses. Such a box would also let you lend aid to friends in need by sharing your unfettered internet access with those trapped behind government firewalls that prevent them from learning about the world or speaking plainly to it.\nSuch boxes exist in the form of plug computers and mesh routers, tiny, inexpensive machines that can take the place of other electronics in your life, that draw so little power (often as little as 5W) that they can be run off of batteries or solar panels. We even have free software, software meant to empower and support individuals, to do all of the things mentioned above.\nWhat we need is the glue to hold all of that together, the architecture of which pieces stack together in which way to turn a collection of possibilities into an appliance so easy to use that you forget you even have one, at least until that moment when you really need it. The FreedomBox Foundation was built to put this all together. It was started by community leaders with long track records and lives as a community project. But the past few months have shown us all that there are millions of people around the world who need such a device now and we need to pick up the pace and get them made so that next time, our friends have some help. That is why we are asking for your help.\nIn Need of Community Angels\nThere are many people out there, in many different communities, who feel the same way we do about profiling, internet kill switches, and the need to give people greater independence in their network communications, but turning all that interest and the offers of help into a real software suite is going to take coordination, organization, and bringing people together in focused groups to get this system built. That is why the FreedomBox Foundation was created, but it requires real work and a real demonstration of community size and support to keep everything moving. If we can meet our funding goal now, we can start doing that work full time, build road maps for the core components, and put together a series of conferences/hack days to pull the community together.\nThe Freedom Box is a community based endeavor from the ground up. That includes everything from architecture and engineering through to administration and funding. It's the reason why we're seeking the first round of investment from our own community. We want it to be clear that this project begins and remains in the hands of the people who give it life at every stage and in every part of the project.\nAlmost all the software we need to make this work is already out there in the free software world, but if we are going to pull it all together, first we need to get up to speed. Please join us and help keep the momentum going from 0 to 60!\nWhen will we get the software?\nThe release timeline for this software depends a good deal on how much support we can gather this month, which is why we are reaching out now. If we can reach our goal, we hope to release a first version of the software six months later. This is our best working etimate but we will know a lot more in the next 30 days and will continue to update everyone here and on the Foundation's website. If you are pledging enough for any of the software rewards ($50 and up), know that we hope to have everything shipped out within in week of the 0.1 release, if not on the release day itself, and please keep your eye here and on the Foundation site for updates.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #12", "update_userinfo": "FreedomBox On Sale Now", "update_content": "Sales Have Launched\nThe big day is finally here: sales of the first commercially available FreedomBox have launched!

This is the key to the success of the film. Every penny will be up there on screen for you and everyone else to see. Anima will be shot on 35mm film, sound-mixed in Dolby and presented digitally at Screen Australia Studios within 6 months of today.\nIf I donate, when can I redeem the incentive?: All incentives, big and small, will only happen if our goal is met. If we do meet our goal, immediately after we finish the film we will begin to ship and send out the DVD's, and tickets to the private premiere will be sent in the mail.\nHow can I contact you?: Glad you asked! You can contact us at: info@singularityfilms.net, also, check out the website at: www.animafilm.com.au which is updated regularly with blogs about film and announcements to keep you involved in the adventure.

He has sailed to Iran as a merchant seaman, driven a tank over exploding kimchee vats in Korea, and survived two prisoner-of-war camps in Japan during WWII. You wouldn't know by looking at him - I only found out after I saw a curious scar on his back and I started asking questions. And then I asked more questions.\nRecently, my dad showed me a secret diary he kept while he was a prisoner of war in Japan during WWII. I was shocked. Also excited, and touched. Why show me? Why now? Why were there some pages missing? It was like a window into his nineteen-year-old mind, into his soul. Are we really that similar? No. I try, I try very hard \u2013 to emulate his kindness, generosity and tenacity. Life to him is pretty black and white. Things just are. This resoluteness, this assuredness \u2013 I don\u2019t have that at all. Life to me is all shades of grey, of maybes and possibilities.\nI read the old, carefully penned pages, and start to daydream and ask questions. It starts to make sense, why every day as a free man is a holiday. What ceases to amaze me is that as much as he wants to tell me stories from his past, he is still very much part of the present.\nHe won\u2019t be around forever, which is why this unique look into a family \u2013 an American family with international ties \u2013 is timely and important. Please help me finish making this film, EVERY DAY IS A HOLIDAY.\nTo watch the special Kickstarter trailer, click on the video above and you'll see my dad embarrass me in the first 20 seconds.\nWHY PLEDGE? EVERY DAY IS A HOLIDAY has been green-lit by the Independent Television Service (ITVS)!\nWe need your help to bring EVERY DAY IS A HOLIDAY to public television! The Independent Television Service (ITVS) has green-lit our film and will provide $79,000 in matching funds towards the completion of the film once we contribute $34,496. We hope to raise as much of these funds as possible on Kickstarter. So far, we've received over $10,000 in pledges. Thank you! The funds we receive will be used for post-production. But there's still more to go!\nHelp us meet the challenge! And score tickets to the premiere, an exclusive interview from the director, your name in the credits, and more!\nMake pledges of ANY AMOUNT on KICKSTARTER. EVERY dollar you pledge will go DIRECTLY to post-production and help bring the film to public television. Sample costs include:\n$1000 one day of sound design\n$2500 basic map animation\n$7500 editing sessions\n$10000 archival licensing\nThe last day to pledge is February 28! Please help us meet our FUNDRAISING GOAL to get our matching funds.\nFAQ Where can I learn more about the project? Please visit the official website: http://www.everydayisaholiday.org. You will find more information about the film, the cast, and relevant posts about documentaries, filmmaking and WWII. You\u2019ll get an inside peek into the director\u2019s slightly quirky brain.\nHow else can I help? You can also help by telling others! Become a fan of our Facebook page: http://www.facebook.com/pages/Every-Day-Is-a-Holiday-Documentary-Film/170949786281906\nWhy not set your goal as $34,496? $8,000 was our initial Kickstarter goal to continue with post-production, since Kickstarter is an all or nothing fundraising platform. We are also applying for grants from foundations. It's quite a process, so we very much appreciate your support!\nDon't want to pledge online?
