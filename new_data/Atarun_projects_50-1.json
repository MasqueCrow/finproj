Their origins long ago lost to time, the valuable and seemingly-magical relics within are an even greater threat to all involved.\nBlood Type: O\nLikes: Exploration, cheese, frogs\nDislikes: Being lectured \nGood-natured and energetic, Mirai tries to see the best in everyone. She arrived in New Riverstone a year ago with no memory of her past life. \nAfter finding the Flowstone in an ancient ruin, she can manifest Flow into physical matter, allowing her to build and modify existing structures, so long as she has enough resources. \nAs her story unfolds, she will learn that even with her newfound power, not everything broken in life can be easily put back together.\n\u201cNew Riverstone is our home. With everyone\u2019s help, I\u2019ll build a village we\u2019ll all be proud of!\u201d\nBlood Type: B\nLikes: Cinnamon rolls, Captain Crimm\nDislikes: Bullies\nA young pirate. While hot-headed and stubborn, she is fiercely loyal to those she cares about. \nTreated as disposable deadweight by some of her crew mates, Vivian has been bullied into activities that their captain would not approve of. \nThrough meeting Mirai, Vivian finds the courage to stand up for herself, even if she must stand alone.\n\u201cI won\u2019t be part of a crew that tries to justify robbing from innocent people. I'm better than this. We're better than this.\u201d\nBlood Type: A\nLikes: Word puzzles, being included\nDislikes: Show-offs, muscleheads\nThe military outcast. Marcus has a low-ranked position in the Republic of Byzankar's naval fleet. \nSoft-spoken and reserved, he thinks first before taking action. He joined the military not out of love for country, but for his fascination with Relics, ancient technology excavated from ruins around the world. \nDistrusted by most of New Riverstone, Vivian of all people will reach out to him and help him realize that some risks are worth taking.\n\u201cThese villagers did nothing wrong. There\u2019s no reason to take things this far.\u201d\nBlood Type: O\nLikes: Poetry; hot tea\nDislikes: Anyone threatening his crew\nThe infamous pirate king. As the Scarlet Tusk captain, Borras Crimm is the most wanted man in the world. \nStrong-willed and decisive, he takes any and all measures necessary to secure his crew of people displaced by conflicts around the world. After a Byzankar ambush, his ship finds its way to Ocean's End. \nNormally not one to attack innocents despite his reputation, his desperation to save his starving crew sends him on a collision course with Mirai and New Riverstone.\n\u201cA captain\u2019s first duty is to their crew. Always.\u201d\nBlood Type: AB\nLikes: Training, collecting swords\nDislikes: Beggars, laziness\nThe rising star of the Byzankar fleet. Driven, calculating, and with a strong sense of justice, Cerule quickly reached the rank of Commander at a young age. \nLittle is known about her, besides a reputation as a fierce naval combatant. When she finally corners the elusive Borras Crimm at his most vulnerable, a deeply-sown seed of vengeance begins to bloom, threatening to consume her.\n\u201cI won\u2019t permit anyone to leave this island until I have Borras Crimm locked away in chains.\u201d\nThe town of New Riverstone\nLocated on the largest island of Ocean's End, this young town is comprised of war refugees, explorers, and those curious enough to live on the edge of civilization. Mirai has made her home here for the past year as she tries to recover her memories.\n\nThe Islands of Ocean's End\nWith sandy beaches, wooded foothills, rocky mountains, and extensive caves, Ocean's End is an explorer's paradise. \nMirai's curiosity leads through every nook and cranny of the islands as she gathers materials, evades pursuers, and looks for a way to save New Riverstone.\n\nA long-forgotten civilization\nScattered around the world are mysterious ruins of impossibly advanced technology. \nSome people revere the ruins, some plunder their secrets for their own purposes, but no one knows who the \"Panganeans\" were, or why the facilities were created. After Mirai finds the flowstone, it sets events in motion that reveals how closely she is tied to the ruins, and leaves her with a difficult choice...\n\nThe Harbinger\nThe flagship of the Mighty Byzankar Navy,  this naval destroyer is the pinnacle of Panganean-derived tech and shipbuilding prowess.  On board is a mysterious passenger, guarded by the legendary Commander Cerule, the youngest to ever earn the title. Under her guidance, the Harbinger has cornered the pirate ship \"The Scarlet Tusk\" and is prepared to use it's incredible power to end the pirate king once and for all. \nFlowstone Saga has real-time combat where your party faces off against up to 3 monsters at once. While monsters and your allies take turns attacking and using special abilities, the main character - Mirai - controls the flow of battle on the puzzle board.\nBy clearing lines, you'll deal damage to a monster with a regular attack. Clear multiple lines at once for much more powerful blows. \nSome monsters may use charge attacks which can be interrupted with your attacks. This makes it important to weigh the state of your puzzle board with the battle scenario. Is it worth it to clear some lines to defend against a special attack, or would it be better to continue to build up blocks for an even stronger counter?\nWe want Flowstone Saga to be enjoyable by everyone, not just puzzle experts. So, in addition to game difficulty options, we've created a feature called \"Hold Mode\", which is selectable before starting a new game, and anytime in-game.  \n\nIn \"Hold Mode\", battles are no longer real-time. You still move pieces around, and have access to all the same powers, but there is no 'gravity' pulling pieces down,  and enemies will not move or act in real-time. \n\nYou have total freedom to plan your next move carefully. Then, once you lock a piece in (and only then), the enemy turn gauges will increase slightly.  \n\nEventually, enemies will act, but it will be on your terms, based on the number of moves you've made - and not the passage of real time.  This way, you still have the strategy elements of where to put pieces (and make combos, use powers, clear enemy blocks, etc) and deal with enemies, but with absolutely no time pressure at all!\n\nYou can try \"Hold Mode\" for yourself in the public builds available above, or watch a quick demo in the video below!\nPLAY\n\nThere will be over 100 different foes to defeat over the course of the journey, from the adorable Beewis, to fearsome Thunder Komodos and beyond!\nJust some of the many foes you will face in your adventure\nIn addition to regular attacks, most monsters have attacks that will interact with your puzzle board. Some will drop blocks that will slowly damage Mirai until they are cleared, while others will replace her current piece with something trickier to manage. \n\nThere are dozens of different monster attacks, and each will require it's own strategy to overcome.\n\nMirai can use her powers to create or repair structures. To do this, you must fill in the overall shape of flow energy with set pieces. \nMirai creates a ladder to escape danger\nCreate objects to move to a new area, or collect an out-of-reach treasure.\nForce open locked doors, or hack computer terminals.\nRepair broken walls or barriers to defend against invaders.\nAlso scattered throughout the islands are optional ruins that Mirai can repair for bonus rewards. Maybe something special will happen if all of them are repaired...\nThough these puzzles start out easy, some are quite tricky... and equally satisfying to solve! \n\nChoose from several dozen pieces to find your perfect combination\nUnlike other falling block games, you can choose what pieces are in your \"bag\" using the power of the Flowstone. You must have 8 different pieces, which have their advantages and disadvantages.\n\nSmall pieces offer flexibility and options - they fit in almost any gap!\nLarge pieces grant speed to fill the board quickly, allowing for frequent power attacks\nAlmost every piece available has link crystals that multiply damage when combined carefully. Some difficult pieces are extra powerful, so if you can use them effectively, you will reap the rewards.\nCreating a balanced loadout to suit your individual style will be the key to victory in battle!\n\n Equipment found or purchased can be enhanced with the \"Dreamcaster\", an ancient relic that allows entry into the item itself, known as an \"Item Dream\".  \nEach Item Dream is a mini-roguelike, with a small but challenging randomly-generated dungeon. The rules are simple: Defeat the boss to remove impurities, and the item grows stronger. Fail and be forcefully ejected back into the real world.\nSome gear that may appear weak initially have great power hidden within, and will require full purification to show their true form. \n\nMirai starts out with only \"Flow\" blocks, which deal physical damage.\nThroughout the game, she will harness other elements to open up new strategies.\n Fire blocks deal damage-over-time, and are a better use of small line clears\n Ice blocks freeze an enemies and prevent them from acting\n Lightning blocks have damage that scale even higher with bigger clears, and hit all enemies at once\n\nAlso, various barriers exist in the world that call for certain elements...\nNew Riverstone is always growing, and with Mirai's new powers, creating new structures is a snap...or is it?\nVillagers will have a request, and let you know what materials they need for the building to be built.\nMonsters throughout the island have stolen key items in building certain structures. Mirai will need to find the monsters and reclaim the goods!\nOnce everything has been collected, the structure can be built.\nEnjoy deliciously prepared food from Nando, once the campfire has been completed.\nBuilding some structures will provide new services or buffs to Mirai and her party on their adventure.\nSome buildings can be further upgraded to provide stronger bonuses and perks.\n\nTo help get the raw materials she will need to build the town, Mirai can team up with the happy-go-lucky but absentminded Miner, Hagan.\nThis game mode is a race against the clock, as Hagan will throw various materials onto the puzzle field. Any material block Mirai clears, she collects! \nWhen the time is up, Hagan is too sleepy to continue, and it's time to return back to town. Maybe if you can pass him a few coins, he'll extend the timer a bit longer.\nThere are many different areas to mine, each with it's own collection of resources.\nOccasionally, Hagan will find an old treasure chest filled with gold. Clearing this scores Mirai a quick payday!\n\nWhen Mirai builds the garden, it's magic somehow attracts the attention of some nearby Spirit Frogs; friendly ghosts of a legendary troupe of adventuring amphibians. \nBrave adventurer~! I lend you my power!\nFeeding them some delicious food from the garden causes them to bond with Mirai, giving her the ability to select a patron frog, who will instill in her it's Job Class abilities from it's former life.\nThe Flow-infused soil grows fresh crops remarkably fast!\nFreely swap Frog Spirits in the status screen to be able to use their abilities, based on classic Tangledeep job classes such as Brigand, Edge Thane, Paladin, and more!\nGiving Eric seeds and soil found while adventuring, or from collecting with Hagan will grow more food in the garden.\nFeed the Sprit Frogs the collected food to level them up and learn more powerful skills and perks!\nAs you level up the spirit frogs, the job buffs they provide get stronger!\n\nLater in the game, you can test your skills against mighty opponents. Start as an unranked fighter, and smash your way to the top, to claim the GrandMaster title!\nMirai and her friends will start in the Bronze league and fight their way up!\nThere are 4 fights per tier, with a final encounter to test your mettle. Win to be promoted to the next division!  \nThere will be familiar foes in the arena, but some challengers are found nowhere else. The most difficult opponents in the game await you in here.\n\nAs New Riverstone grows, Mirai helps construct a beautiful outdoor bistro! Once this is built, she can have lunch chats with the villagers to learn more about their backstories and personalities. \n\nYou can have a friend come along and endow the party with a unique buff\nFrom Hagan's ability to find extra items after battles, to Alasdair's defensive bonus, each buff is useful!\nAs you level up your friendship with each friend, buffs grow in strength, and can  further enhance your favorite strategy.\nThough many ruins are buried beneath the surface, one stands alone as the most mysterious and labyrinthine. Tangledeep is a dungeon of constantly shifting caverns and underground jungles, with fragments of civilizations nestled within. It has proven impossible to map, as its layout is constantly in flux. \n\nWhat lies at the bottom? It's up to you to find out.\n\nLike Item Dreams, Tangledeep is a roguelike mode, with randomly-generated dungeon floors. While Item dreams are smaller, with only a few floors, Tangledeep is much more extensive, and is considered endgame or post-game content\nMirai starts on the first floor with basic shapes and no gear. Defeat increasingly-difficult enemies as you explore, obtaining new pieces, equipment, perks, and more.\nEarn special items that can be brought to the main adventure, as well as special currency to buy cosmetic items and town upgrades.\n\nFlowstone Saga's soundtrack has the soul of a classic JRPG soundtrack of the 16 and 32bit eras, with the memorable melodies that classic games are known for, brought to life with modern production and performances that the consoles of yesterday could never do. \n\nThe music of a great RPG always lives on in our minds long after the credits have rolled, so we're working hard to ensure the Flowstone Saga soundtrack is perfect.\n\nFrom day 1, we've shared progress, ideas, and plans publicly and transparently, and we plan on maintaining that relationship with the community throughout development. \nWe have a dedicated channel on Discord: #Flowstone_saga.\n\nTalk to other players, give feedback, report bugs, or share memes... come on in! \n\nWe're there daily and are happy to talk shop, take suggestions, and give updates on what we're working on. Talk to us and other players about your experiences with the game! Share strategies, tricks, or awesome combos you've pulled off.\n\nIn 2017, we ran a successful Kickstarter campaign for our first title, Tangledeep, with a similar purpose: raising money to further polish art and music. We think this same approach makes sense for Flowstone Saga. While we have invested our own time and money heavily into the game, there is always more we can do to improve the game's presentation, for example:\nMore character portraits with additional moods or expressions\nProfessional mixing and mastering of the soundtrack\nAdditional live musicians to make some tracks sound even better\nA greater variety of particle FX and animations \nMore sound effects to accompany the wide range of abilities and events\nAdditional flavor text and character conversations\n... and much more!\n\nWe do not need money to finish the core game. We're doing that no matter what! We're fortunate to be in the position where income from our previous game and income from other projects is enough for us to fund the core development of Flowstone Saga.\n\nThat means no risk that we'll accidentally burn through our Kickstarter funding and be unable to finish. Instead, this funding will all go to making the game tangibly, materially better-looking and sounding. What's not to love about that?\nWe've come a long way, but we have a ways to go! Here is a look at the current state of the game. Some of these bars fill up faster than others, but we are committed to transparency in what we are working on, and keeping the community updated on progress.\nBesides a Kickstarter-exclusive wallpaper, digital copies of the game, soundtrack, and artbook, we've got lots of tempting custom rewards! \n\nGrand Champion Explorer\nGive us a name, and we put it in the game. It could be you, your pet, or your D&D character. Names could be used in special items, locations, NPCs, dungeons, monsters, etc. \nPuzzle Crafter\nPut on your puzzlin' cap! Work with us to turn your puzzle ideas into reality. Show off your cleverness by making an object outline, or make players curse your name by making something brutally difficult. The choice is yours!\n\nArena Master\n\nThe Arena is an endgame gauntlet filled with the baddest bosses around, and you can add your creation to the list of fearsome fighters. It could be a crazy creature, your pet, sky's the limit!\nWork with us to design stats, special attacks, and battle strategy!\n\nHero of Legend \nEach job class in the game will have an ultimate armor that will be obtained after a quest chain. Name and give a backstory of the former owner of one of these elite sets of gear!\nWeapon Master\nThe most powerful weapons are guarded jealously by equally powerful monsters. Work with our artists and designers to create a relic weapon that is one of the most powerful in the game\nWork with us to create a suitably-powerful guardian that must be battled to earn this weapon.\nGeomancer Explorer\nTurn your MSpaint sketch into a beautiful vista!\nWork with us to create your own special place, named after you. Using a sketch and/or description provided, we will build the area, fill it with monsters and treasures, plus a unique landmark that will only appear in your area.\n\nOC-do-not-steal Explorer\nThere are all kinds of beings in our world; bring your very own to life with this reward!\nWork with us to get  your character design in the game with custom sprites, portraits, and a short backstory for the players to learn about as a side quest.\nYour character will be able to join Mirai's party as a friend, giving them a unique buff.\n\nThe adorable plush Goldfrogs\nSmall and soft, these cute croakers are handmade by DragonAvenger Crafts and designed by Flea Circus Designs. They measure 3\" tall, 3.5\" wide, are made of soft minky fabric and feature shiny golden coin embroidery.\nOn May 16th, we reached 100% funding with 3+ weeks left to go! Here are our stretch goals to help keep the hype going and add more cool stuff to the game.\n\n$25,000: Sprig Salon - ACHIEVED!\nMirai's pet fox will be more stylish than ever! Unlock accessories, animations, and palette swaps to customize this cute fella, who is always be visible by your side. And yes, you'll be able to pet him, too.\n\n$30,000: 2nd Player Assist - ACHIEVED!\nA buddy on your couch can help out on the battlefield by providing helpful bonuses, and thwacking enemies! By connecting a second controller, your friend will get their own Mana gauge to use powers and give you an extra edge in difficult battles. \n\n$35,000: Town Planner\nTransform New Riverstone into the town you want it to be! Find or purchase decor items to spruce up and enhance the town, from natural objects like bushes, trees, and flower patches, to statues, fountains, birdhouses, and more. Place each item virtually anywhere in town with free positioning!\n\n$40,000: Battle Jukebox + 6 New Themes\nHot-blooded music for fighting! We'll add six brand-new battle themes to the game, plus a \"Battle Jukebox\" that will play random themes with every encounter.\nThese new tracks will be composed by lead designer & composer Andrew \"OA\" Luers, lead programmer and Tangledeep composer Andrew \"zircon\" Aversa, renowned electronic & soundtrack artist Jimmy \"Big Giant Circles\" Hinson, and epic orchestral composer & OST mixer Nabeel Ansari.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nDeveloping a game often involves unexpected bugs and issues which can throw a wrench into even the best plans and schedules. This is especially true when porting to Nintendo Switch, which involves approvals and testing that we have limited control over.\n\nWe have made what we think are reasonable delivery estimations for v1.0 of the game, based on our experience successfully shipping \"Tangledeep\" on PC in 2018 and on Switch in 2019. We also plan on launching in Early Access before the v1.0 release in order to further polish the game based on player feedback.\n\nWe have put over two years into Flowstone Saga already, along with a significant amount of our own money. There is very little we can imagine that would prevent us from finishing and releasing the game, especially given our track record with Tangledeep.\n\nThat said, if any issues arise that might delay the game beyond our planned date, we will communicate this well in advance to backers. The most likely issues would relate to Nintendo Switch approvals, or waiting on third-parties such as localization teams.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Katie's Tip Jar", "descp": "Thank you for supporting Flowstone Saga!

The one people whisper about. The one that has gone unlived in for years. Sometimes a few hearty souls creep in, it is said, to see what treasures or secrets they can find. Most find nothing\u2014just an empty old house. Some return shaken. A few don\u2019t return at all.\nYou\u2019ve seen this house before. If not in this city, then in some other. You\u2019ve heard the rumors\u2014and if you haven\u2019t, well, someday they\u2019ll find you.\nWhat happens to a house when it sits alone for so many long years? What jealousies and hatreds does it quietly nurture? What whispers echo through its empty hallways? What waits, crouched within its dark rooms, hungering for the return of life?\nFor you.\nThe Darkest House is a tabletop roleplaying game (RPG) product built from the ground up for online play, with unique features that take advantage of the online environment for an awesome experience. It's compatible with the game you're playing now. In fact, it's made for it! That\u2019s because The Darkest House derives its horror from the bonds, backstories, ideals, loves, and fears your existing characters bring into it. Experiencing it will add depth to your campaign, your party, and your characters\u2014those who come out alive!\nCross the threshold. Explore The Darkest House. The experience will change and challenge your PCs, their party, and your gaming group. And you won't have to wait long: You'll  have everything you need to bring The Darkest House to your campaign in May (with extras and exclusives to follow).\nScroll down to try a preview of The Darkest House!\nThe Darkest House is a digital product designed specifically to the needs of running and playing games online\u2014and built to take maximum advantage of that mode of play. Think of it like an RPG book reimagined to make the most of the online environment. Every image and map is conveniently shareable and downloadable. Each encounter is formatted to your screen, giving you everything you need in a single view. Text for sharing with the players is easily copied with a single click. A rich network of hyperlinks makes navigation simple and intuitive. The Darkest House is as easy on the GM as the house itself is challenging to the PCs.\nUse The Darkest House in conjunction with your preferred online TTRPG platform: run your game on Zoom or Discord, or use a virtual tabletop (VTT) like Roll20 or Astral. Only the GM needs a copy of The Darkest House\u2014like a conventional RPG product, it gives the GM the information, resources, and tools to run the game, plus loads of handouts, images, and other sharable items to distribute, as appropriate, to the players.\nThe Darkest House consists of:\nThe downloadable product, containing the many dozens of rooms of the house itself. This is what the GM will primarily use during play. There\u2019s enough content for many visits to the house, and dozens of hours of play\u2014and through stretch goals the house continues to grow!\n The Darkest House: Secrets of the House in PDF, a GM's guide detailing the House's background, conversion rules, and the House Rules set you'll use as your PCs explore, and try to escape from, the Darkest House.\n The Darkest House Player's Guide in PDF, which gives players the character conversion rules and everything they need to explore (and try to escape from) the Darkest House.\nTo use The Darkest House, the GM will need a desktop or laptop computer running macOS or Windows and a broadband internet connection. Scroll down to try a preview of The Darkest House.\nHow It Works\nAlthough The Darkest House is a completely new type of product, you'll use it in basically the same way you use a typical RPG book or PDF\u2014it's just easier and has a lot more features for online play. You'll still use a VTT or videoconference platform (such as Roll20 or Zoom) to run your game. Your players won't access The Darkest House app itself\u2014like a physical adventure book, it's just for the GM. (You will share The Darkest House Player's Guide PDF, and loads of handouts, maps, and images with them, though.)\nHere's an example: Charles normally runs his games using Zoom for audio and video, and Slack for text messaging, sharing JPGs of handouts, and rolling dice. In addition, he has his game books and notes open on his desk beside him, or PDFs and other files open on his computer. When running The Darkest House, he'll use Zoom and Slack the same way, and keep The Darkest House app open on his computer in place of all those books or PDFs. He can share maps, images, and text with just a click or two, pasting them into his Slack channel as the PCs encounter new rooms, creatures, and clues.\nLaTia runs her games on Roll20. The Darkest House works the same way in that environment, with one additional advantage: LaTia can set up her encounters in advance, downloading the maps and resources before the game starts and setting them up within Roll20.\nTry It!\nWant to see how it works? Check out the preview of The Darkest House now for a look at a few of the rooms and features. Download it for either macOS or Windows (below). Open it, have a look at the intro page, and explore as you see fit\u2014or take this little tour:\nClick Explore The Darkest House Now on the right side of the intro page and you'll find yourself in the Boundless Room, just one example of the House's many, many rooms.\nSee the words Pried Up Floorboards on the map? Click them, and the description will open to the right.\nSome items aren't tagged on the map. Click The Giggling Ghost at the bottom right of the screen.\nUnder the first set of boxed text, and click the Copy Text button. Return to this Kickstarter, go into the comments, and paste. That's how easy it is to copy and paste info for the players. Features like these make the most of the online environment\u2014making it an advantage instead of an impediment!\nYou can also share images and maps just as easily. Go to The Family Portrait and click Download under the handout to download the image, or \"Copy Link\" to paste the link into a chat or browser window to share it that way. You can do the same with the room map and main illustration.\nThe portrait holds the secret to escaping this particular room. Click the link to the Interior Courtyard to continue your exploration of the House.\nContinue to explore to discover the many ways The Darkest House stands apart from conventional RPG products. This preview of the app is not final and only demonstrates a small portion of The Darkest House. The final product may differ slightly.\nThat old house that everyone whispers about. That apartment at the end of the hall where no tenant ever stays for long. That strange unit in the station quarters sector, where everything seems a bit off. These are among the many entrances to the Darkest House.\nLike an invasive vine or a creeping shadow, the Darkest House insinuates itself into any universe. It is a malignant and primal force, unconcerned with the specifics of the worlds it seeps into. The Darkest House exists in our world\u2014in your world\u2014in any world. Wherever there is hunger, the Darkest House can gain a foothold. It is perfectly happy to take root in your campaign.\nOr campaigns. The house draws from the many worlds it touches. It need not pull all its victims from the same setting. Imagine an experience that gathers your favorite characters from different campaigns to work together to survive its horrors. As a product specially designed for online play, scattered gaming groups can come back together for a unique reunion experience.\nThe Darkest House\u2019s effect on character development and backstory makes it really shine when introduced to existing characters and campaigns. It will influence the quality of play for long after the characters have escaped it. \nInject the Darkest House into your ongoing campaign as a horror interlude or as a recurring encounter. It works as a standalone one-shot, but there\u2019s far more to the house than that. With many dozens of rooms (and growing, through stretch goals) adding up to 30-50 hours of game play, PCs who escape the house might stumble upon it later, seek it out to further plumb its mysteries, or find themselves drawn into it again to free themselves and their world of its darkness.\nThe house has many aspects, and there will always be more to discover.\nThe House System\nThe Darkest House isn't just compatible with the game you\u2019re already playing\u2014it was made for it! Within The Darkest House, you\u2019ll use the House System. You\u2019ll quickly and easily convert your existing characters (it takes about five minutes) and use those stats while in The Darkest House. Once the PCs emerge, your players will return to their regular setting using their regular character sheets. The House System is a sort of RPG Rosetta Stone, allowing easy translation into and out of any game system\u2014and even letting you bring characters from different games together.\nThe House System is tailored for tension and terror. With each die roll, the players roll the House Die, which might indicate that the house itself takes an action. Players can call upon the essence of the house while they're within it to turn a failure into a success, but every time they do so they accumulate personal Doom. Escaping the house with the weight of such Doom on their shoulders, characters may find themselves scarred, cursed, or haunted in all manner of disturbing ways, carrying remnants of their experience back into their home campaigns long after they've left.\nIt's possible to launch a campaign centered around the Darkest House. But that's not what the house wants. It is strongest when it reaches into an ongoing campaign to test and challenge existing characters. That\u2019s because events in the Darkest House will change characters and alter the campaign setting. The house gets its metaphorical claws into those that cross its threshold, and the house itself changes based on who those characters are, who they have loved, who they have hated, and where they have been. Characters who explore the house and make it back out are never quite the same.\nWant even deeper mysteries? More secrets? More dangers? The Devoured Halls is a separate portion of the Darkest House, with its own rooms, its own secret entrance and exit, and its own mysteries to uncover. Within this section of the house, characters might discover that perhaps the house isn't fully in control of itself\u2026 the house itself might be broken. While The Darkest House is a complete package, The Devoured Halls adds its own flavor and offers its own experience in keeping with the rest of the house. It fits in seamlessly and offers additional depth and an entirely new mini story for characters to investigate. \nThe Devoured Halls backer level includes the complete Darkest House plus the additional content in the Devoured Halls\u2014a Kickstarter exclusive available only through this campaign. Backing at this level has even more exclusive benefits\u2014you also get:\nMonte Cook's secret tour of the Darkest House: In the style of a director's commentary track, Monte takes you on a video tour of the House covering his favorite rooms. He delves into their genesis and inspiration, gives you insights into the lore behind them, and talks about how he's used them in his own games.\nThe Darkest House digital art book: The Darkest House contains dozens and dozens of illustrations, all as mysterious as they are beautiful. The Art of The Darkest House presents all of them\u2014including illustrations from the Devoured Halls\u2014in beautiful detail. Annotations by Monte and Art Director Bear Weiter accompany many of the illustrations, and several also include details or alternate versions calling out their secrets and hidden features.\nMonte Cook has designed many RPGs over his 30+ year career, including Dungeons & Dragons 3rd Edition, the Cypher System, Numenera, and Invisible Sun. He wanted to share why he he was inspired to create The Darkest House, and what design decisions he made. Check out his insights below.\nI'm Monte Cook, and I created and designed the Darkest House. I've been using the essence of it in various campaigns for years, and I thought I'd take a moment to describe why I designed it the way I have, and hopefully why you'll find it intriguing and interesting as well.\nWhy Focus on Online Gaming?\nAt Monte Cook Games, we're spread out all across the continent. We've been regularly playing RPGs on Zoom or Roll20 since well before the pandemic, as of course many gamers have. In the 21st Century, gaming online has become a standard feature of tabletop games, and the last year or so has accelerated that aspect of running and playing games to an incredible degree. Gaming online has its own challenges, but it has its own strengths as well. As a designer, I've been pondering how to not just focus on the needs of online play, but to in fact embrace online play, bringing the aspects of gaming that it does particularly well to the fore. The ability to share art, to share text, and to send individual players direct messages are just some of the things that The Darkest House not just enables but shines a spotlight upon. Meanwhile, the difficulties of online gaming, such as managing lots of information, maintaining a mood, and dealing with cumbersome mechanics are all facets of the experience that the Darkest House eases.\nWhy Focus on Cross-System Play?\nOne of the things that's been true of a lot of us over the last year is a desire to reconnect with old pals or faraway friends. If your primary means of socializing is a video conference, people a thousand miles away are no farther away than those up the street. Still, talking to your friends through a computer screen can sometimes be hard. With all the additional barriers that online gaming can create, why should game systems add another?\nThe Darkest House offers an easy way to quickly convert the essence of any character from any system into a simple but interesting character who operates within the house's own, specific rules, tailored to the experiences within. My dream is that people will use The Darkest House as an excuse to rekindle that lapsed campaign with their old gaming group separated by time and distance, regardless of what system was being used. Or, perhaps even more exciting, the GM who's got a selection of friends who never regularly game together and use different systems can take their existing characters, temporarily convert them to the House System, and all go on an exciting and challenging (or horrifying) adventure together.\nI believe that RPGs bring people together, and I hope that The Darkest House brings people together who might not otherwise get to easily enjoy each other's company. (And what better way to rekindle old bonds than in absolute terror?) \nWhy a Haunted House?\nInspired by games like Kitty Horrowshow's Anatomy, books like Mark Z. Danielewski's House of Leaves, and films like Stanley Kubrick's The Shining, I realized that the horror genre and haunted houses in particular offer unique opportunities to shine a light on characters, and RPGs are all about characters. I wanted to create an adventure that would deepen the characters even as it put them through their paces.\nWhen PCs enter the Darkest House, they'll find far more than just a haunted house. It is a crucible of sorts, where their mettle and their minds will be tested. Those who fall short will suffer heavy consequences. Those who can hold their own, however, emerge more deeply developed with a greater insight into their world, their companions, and most of all themselves. The Darkest House forces players to think about their characters' deepest fears, dreams, their families, and their faith in their friends. Encounters are designed to focus less on damage dealt or resources used and more on the personalities, past experiences, and fundamental truths of a character. And if a character is lacking any of those, the Darkest House will enable the GM and players to work together to create them, or flesh them out, as needed.\nIf you've read this far, you've very likely picked up on the fact that within the Darkest House, it's the house itself that is the enemy. I have long had a fascination with fictional places with a mind or an essence all their own. And when that essence evolves over a long period of loneliness, neglect, and exposure to darkness and suffering, it makes for a truly unique \"villain\" far different than any ghost, specter, or demon could ever hope to be. And if that location, that house, grows and seeps in both space and time, devouring the very locations and loved ones important to those that cross its doorstep, well... I don't want to get into spoiler territory. Let's just say, if nothing else, The Darkest House certainly offers some unique experiences that will create stories your players will be talking about for years to come.\nIf you choose any physical add-on items, please check our Kickstarter Redemption page for information on reward redemption and shipping costs.\n\n This project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 1,100+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $460M raised between them.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is the nineteenth Kickstarter campaign for Monte Cook Games.

We truly believe it has the potential to be a game-changer, and we created this Kickstarter because we simply cannot build it without your help.\nWim De Hert is owner and founder of BlueJay Design Consultancy, and has over 20 years of experience in illustration and graphic design. While being an avid Pathfinder and Dungeon&Dragons player for as long as he can remember, creating Dungeon Alchemist has been an ambition ever since getting a fantasy game at the age of 7. Wim will be working on Dungeon Alchemist\u2019s lead visuals, concept design and modelling.\nKarel is an experienced game developer and senior graphics programmer. Karel has been in the game industry for over 10 years and has released games on mobile platforms and consoles. Before that, he earned a PhD at the University of Antwerp on machine learning and computer simulation. With a passion for video games and RPG\u2019s in particular and lots of experience programming games and AI algorithms, Karel is the perfect person to tackle this job! \nWe are a two-man team and we do everything ourselves. This means that we can use all the help we can get to spread the love! The more money we collect in this Kickstarter, the more time we can spend on developing Dungeon Alchemist and adding cool new features, and the quicker our app will be finished. Everybody wins!\nIf you want to help us fulfil our dream, you can do so in several ways:\nJoin our Discord Server and engage with the community.\nTell everyone about us on Facebook.\nFollow, retweet and engage with Dungeon Alchemist on Twitter.\nTalk about us on your favourite subreddit:  /r/battlemaps, /r/dnd, /r/dndmaps, /r/Pathfinder_RPG, /r/Roll20, /r/FoundryVTT,  /r/FantasyGrounds, ...\nThis campaign is promoted by Backercamp.

Serenity. The Millennium Falcon. \nYou can\u2019t have a good space story without an iconic spaceship. Of course, more often than not, the heroes of the story aren\u2019t flying some shiny new cruiser. Those are for the wealthy, the elites\u2014not our lovable scoundrels. No, they fly the bucket of bolts\u2014the outworn, patched-up junker held together with hope, prayers and duct tape.\nThe eponymous 'bucket of bolts'\nThese ships weren\u2019t always hunks of junk though\u2014they have long and storied histories, and might even have been respectable vessels at some point. We only ever see a slice of that story though, a single captain and their motley crew. \nThis game flips the perspective.  \n\nThe Game.\nBucket of Bolts is a hack of Artefact, my game from last year's ZineQuest. Instead of creating a magical item, this time you'll be telling the story of a single spaceship. You\u2019ll create a brand new freighter, fresh off the manufacturing line, and explore its history through each of the people who captain it. Your ship will change as the decades pass - new names, new parts, fresh paint, fresh starts - until your story draws to a close.\nYou\u2019ll choose your Captains, bringing them to life with names and details, and create stories of their time with your ship using prompts and tables. When you\u2018re ready to move on, you\u2019ll choose a Fate for your ship. Maybe it\u2019s traded away fairly, but more likely it\u2019s stolen, captured or even wrecked. You might drift for a while as you wait for your next Captain, or the seat might still be warm when a new one takes over. Either way, the galaxy will change around you, and you\u2019ll see it all from the view in the cockpit.\nLike the original Artefact, it\u2019s a great way to spend an hour or two; sketching, world-building and storytelling in your own company. It's also a fantastic way to generate really unique ships for tabletop games like Edge of the Empire, Traveller or Scum & Villainy, with rich backstories, fun details and tonnes of personality.\n\nThe Zine.\nFormat \nA little paper prototype of the zine opening.\nI'll be using a new format for the physical rewards. Beak zines take an A3 sheet of paper and fold it into an 8-page A6 booklet. This process leaves one side of the paper blank, that people sometimes use to make a poster.\nOne of the things that's always bugged me about Artefact is how much flicking around the book you need to do as you play the game. I thought\u2014why not use the blank side of a beak zine for all of the game's content; the tables, questions and prompts you\u2019ll need during play. So that\u2019s what I\u2019m doing.\nIn Bucket of Bolts, you\u2019ll be able to read through all the rules in the booklet and then unfold it into a complete reference for play. Pretty neat huh?\nAnd here it is closing!\nPaper\nExtract comes in a range of lovely colours.\nOf course, I'm still taking every opportunity to make this little zine a deluxe product. I'll be using one of my favourite paper stocks, G.F Smith Extract.\nAs well as having some seriously impressive environmental credentials (it's made from recycled coffee cups), it's also just a lovely paper that comes in some great colours. I\u2019m partial to Mustard, as you can see in the prototype, but we\u2019ll see when the print samples arrive.\n\nInk\nCopies of ARTEFACT, outside on a sunny day.\nAs with my previous projects, I\u2019ll be using Risograph to print the book. That means rich, vivid shades with the aesthetic of screen printing, but viable for large-scale print runs. It\u2019s also one of the most sustainable ways to print, with soy-based inks & low energy machines. It\u2019s going to be beautiful!\n\nIllustration\nTorben is very excellent at drawing spaceships.\nSpeaking of beautiful, I'm also commissioning Torben B\u00f6kemeyer again to do some awesome illustrations for the game. Spaceships are his bread & butter, and I think his sharp, detailed style is a really good fit for this game. You\u2019ll have seen his key art at the top of the page, and he's already hard at work on the game's cover.\n\nCollector\u2019s Edition\nI'm looking forward to an excuse to get wild with paper & ink combos...\nI\u2019m also offering a Collector\u2019s Edition of the game, exclusive to the Kickstarter, packed with bonus printed matter like art prints, stickers and random tables.\nIt\u2019s all paper stuff, but I think it\u2019s gonna feel pretty special.\nAny \u2019game content\u2019 (such as random tables) will be available to all as a digital download.\n\nAccessibility\nLike Artefact and Orbital, the digital edition will also be fully-compatible with screen readers. A second version will also be provided to support a range of visual processing needs. Once again, Yubi will be handling the accessibility design of the digital files.\n\nCommunity Copies\nEvery backer of Bucket of Bolts, physical or digital, will also be contributing one digital copy of the game to be available for free for those who need it. Thanks!\n\nStretch Goals\nThis is intentionally designed as a small project, but I've still got some cool things to announce if we break past our funding goal :)\n\nDelivery.\nTimelines\nI\u2019ve got a draft of the game written, and I\u2019m happy that the core concept works as well for spaceships as it did for magical items (after making a few changes to the design). I\u2019m hoping to get a playtest version out in a month or two, with the full digital version being delivered in late spring/early summer and the physical edition following soon after.\n\nBackerKit\nAs with my previous projects, I\u2019ll be using BackerKit to manage fulfilment. This time, though, I\u2019m collecting shipping fees through Kickstarter so you shouldn\u2019t need to add funds in BackerKit unless you\u2019ve selected add-ons.\n\nOrbital \nOrbital header art\nMy previous project, Orbital, is going to print imminently which means that the bulk of the work for that Kickstarter is done. I\u2019m not shipping out the rewards myself, and the stretch goal content is coming along nicely. I\u2019ll continue to actively manage the project, but barring any catastrophes it shouldn\u2019t take up much headspace.\n\nARTEFACT: Reviews & Remarks.\nI\u2019m so happy with the way Artefact has been received. Here\u2019s hoping I can recapture some of that magic for Bucket of Bolts.\nIf you\u2019re a returning backer: hi, nice to see you again! I hope you also enjoyed Artefact :)\nPrint copies of Artefact\n\"It combines a little bit of writing and a little bit of drawing with a lot of storytelling to make a game that is one of the most relaxing and mindful experiences I have had this year.\" - Shut Up & Sit Down\n\"This is a great system agnostic supplement that could fit on any gamer\u2019s shelf\". \u2014 Pulp Culture Museum\n\"It was a wonderful game that once I started, I had a hard time putting down.

The tightness we experience in the shoulders and upper back is often correlated with hunching, computer/desk work, improper form while working out, carrying a child or a heavy purse. \n\nThe last group of six knobs on the TPR aim to target pressure points in the lower back (lumbar spine), which are commonly associated with: poor posture when we're on our feet or sitting, frequent bending forward, and heavy lifting.\n\n\nBelow is a table that represents what our estimated shipping costs are for this campaign. These shipping costs are based on our projections of sales amount as well as an average of ranges for shipping costs we've attained, thus these shipping costs are subject to change depending on our final results. Our goal is to make this process as transparent and accurate as possible, without any false promises or unexpected changes. After your purchase on Kickstarter, we will be sending you a BackerKit.com survey which will securely process your address and shipping payment.\nWe have been working on the Trigger Point Rocker since 2017. From 3d prints, to plaster molds to real sample molds and years of testing, tweaking and iterating over and over again until we found the perfect solution. Thank you to everyone that has helped us, from the random gym-goers to our beta-testers.

Set in the magical city of Castlecoast, readers get to know Audrey Clary, an alchemy student and heiress who secretly dreams of a different life, and Marion LaRue, a rebellious elemental magic student in search of someone she once loved.\nAs the reader, your choices affect the outcome of Audrey and Marion's day together.\n Length: 2-4 hours, depending on reading speed\n Platforms: PC (Steam/Itch.io; Windows/Mac/Linux); Mobile (iOS/Android)\n Languages: English, Simplified & Traditional Chinese\n Estimated Release: March 2021 (PC). The mobile version will follow months after.\n A WLW (women who love women) story for WLW: Follow a heartwarming, slice-of-life story between two girls as they get a second chance at love and friendship.\n 2 Playable Characters: See the story unfold through the eyes of Audrey and Marion.\n Vibrant Visuals: Immerse yourself in the magical city of Castlecoast, brought to life by animated characters, backgrounds & illustrations.\n Interactive Dialogue Choices: How would you like Audrey and Marion's day to end? Your choice will determine which of the two unique endings they will get.\n Original Soundtrack: Listen to beautifully composed music tracks that accentuates the story's most emotional beats.\n Fully Voiced: Features a cast of talented professional English voice actors to help bring our characters to life.\nAudrey Clary, heiress and LeFay Academy's brightest alchemy student, is about to have her first and worst detention experience of all time. It's bad enough that she has to stay in detention during Sunflower Day\u2014it's even worse that she's stuck in detention with the one and only Marion LaRue, the self-proclaimed \u201cChaotic Fireball Legend\u201d of LeFay Academy.\nMarion LaRue is not having a fun day at all. What was meant to be a harmless little fire turned into an explosion that has her stuck in detention, missing out on one of the rare opportunities for her to enjoy life outside the academy. And of course she just had to be stuck with Audrey Clary, of all the high class LeFay students she could be in detention with.\nDetermined to not miss out on the long-awaited festival, Audrey and Marion begrudgingly work together to escape detention and find their way to the festival. As they explore the city and celebrate the Sunflower Festival together, an old friendship is rekindled, and new feelings begin to bloom.\nWe've teamed up with English voice over veterans at Sound Cadence Studios to bring our characters to life! Check out Perfect Gold's stellar cast below:\nThe purpose of this Kickstarter is to fund the game's development with full English voice acting. The demo that you see right now is funded out of our pockets, along with the help of our generous Patrons. The pandemic has severely impacted our finances, but hitting our base goal ensures that at least we'll have enough funds to release the game by early next year.\nMoreover, our alpha demo right now doesn't feature any voices. Implementing full voice acting on a visual novel is a huge undertaking. It's expensive and requires a ton of logistics and manpower. While having it tremendously raises the quality of a visual novel, it's a feature that we cannot afford by ourselves, that's why we're asking for the community's support.\nPerfect Gold is intended to be a small project. Since we don't want to overscope due to budget constraints, we're limiting our physical rewards for this project. That doesn't make them any less cool, though!\nEven if you can't pledge to our campaign, you can contribute by helping us spread the word! It's very important for more people to know about our game. You can make fanarts, do let's plays, or tell your favorite Streamer/Press/Media about us!\nYou can also show your support by using these Perfect Gold avatars:\nClick the image to download!\nThank you so much!

You may know me from Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook as Guweiz.\nHowever you found your way here, thank you for taking the time to check out my first Kickstarter campaign to create my first ever art book, Guweiz: The Art of Gu Zheng Wei.\nOver my creative journey, I have created pieces that I am very proud of, and have experienced many wonderful moments that I would love to share. For this reason, with the help and expertise of the great people at 3dtotal Publishing, I am crafting my first book.\nAs well as resulting in an inviting and thoroughly packed book, this campaign also gives me the opportunity to offer my art to fans in another physical form \u2013 as exclusive printed gifts.\nContinue reading to discover more about what hides within the 152 pages of the book, admire the additional items available only during this campaign, and take a sneaky peek at the bonus stretch goal items that you can unlock!\nGuweiz: The Art of Gu Zheng Wei will be beautifully presented in hardback, and will explore my artistic journey, from drawing my first anime portrait at seventeen years old, to developing my own unique urban style of manga and working on big-budget films such as Ghost in the Shell.\nWith an affinity for creating gritty textures and fantastical scenes, I categorize my work into two genres I have endless passion for: \u201cfantasy\u201d and \u201curban\u201d. Within these styles, I explore the magical moments in the everyday and the edgy realism of fantasy realms. Get lost in my world of witches, warriors, and whimsical night shoppers.\nTo learn more about my workflow and thought processes, you will also find in-depth tutorials and discover a dissection of my working mindset and unique techniques. Delve into this book to understand the importance of maintaining a visual library for inspiration and reference, and how utilizing the art fundamentals can offer invaluable improvements to your design skills.\nI would love to be able to share this book with you all, and I hope you might consider backing this project to help it become a reality.\nThank you!\nBelow are the exclusive items that are available in addition to the book. Some tiers and gifts are limited, so be sure to pledge quickly if you don\u2019t want to miss out!\nPlease note that as this is a live project, all designs are examples of content I would like to include but these are subject to change.\n\n\nWe have chosen to launch this book through Kickstarter as it gives us the chance to thank those who make this book possible by adding extra stretch goal rewards to the campaign. I have designed four high-quality bonus rewards to be given away if we can meet certain targets.\n\n\n\nStretch goals are available to all backers from Tier 1 and above. Please note: final designs of items are subject to change.\n3dtotal publishing is committed to having a positive effect on the environment.

If you support this campaign we would like to thank you for helping us take on this mission.\n3dtotal Publishing is able to ship worldwide! Simply select your pledge option and your location, and Kickstarter will calculate the shipping for you.\nAll rewards will be sent out at the same time (both signed and unsigned). However, if there is a very high number of backers, please keep in mind that it will take us a few days to work our way through packaging all the rewards. 3dtotal Publishing has a fulfilment company lined up to do this as quickly as possible, so once dispatched, rewards should reach you in 10-15 working days.\nWe have fulfilled many successful Kickstarters and we have a great record for delivering parcels around the world. For this campaign we will only be offering tracked shipping to certain locations as we're really determined that you receive your parcel first time without any hiccups or problems with delivery. Parcels sent to the UK, USA and Europe will be sent using our regular and reliable service, and parcels sent to the rest of the world will be sent with tracked shipping.\nUnforeseen delays that are out of our control can occur during delivery, so please allow an additional two weeks before checking up on your package. We will be doing our best to make sure everything gets to you on time!\nFor those who are not familiar with Kickstarter, it\u2019s a worldwide crowd-funding platform for artists and their creative projects. Once the funding period ends, we will start finalizing the book and the extra rewards, which will be sent to you in July. About a month before that, we will send you a survey through Kickstarter, asking for your address \u2013 the reason we wait until a few weeks before is so that we have everyone\u2019s most up-to-date details. When the survey is ready for you to fill in, you will receive an email through Kickstarter. We ask that you fill the survey in as soon as possible, to avoid any delays in sending out your reward!\nAs seasoned users of Kickstarter, 3dtotal Publishing know that a very small number of backers don\u2019t fill in the survey at the end of a Kickstarter campaign, making it impossible for us to process and ship their rewards. 3dtotal pledges to hold all rewards for backers that fail to fill in their survey for 12 months and to make multiple efforts to contact the backers in question to try to successfully deliver their items.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOne of the biggest challenges will be producing and delivering everything to you on time.

It is a country where everybody follows the law, no matter how absurd it may be at times. You are an ordinary factory worker, who accidentally becomes a member of parliament \u2014 now it\u2019s your turn to decide where this country is headed. There are two parties at the Parliament: one always votes \"yea\" and the other \"nay\". The votes are divided exactly in half and the final decision is always up to the player. Will you earn the love of the whole nation or will it be hatred instead? This depends solely on you!\nSo, basically, Law Law Land is an open world adventure game focused on story, exploration and player decisions, featuring dozens of characters to meet and things to do.\nYour decisions shape the city and change its appearance. For example, you can choose to be a good guy and repair roads and buildings. Or you can cause an economical or ecological crisis \u2014 it's up to you whether you build your dream city or trash-littered dystopia.\nDifferent fractions in Law Law Land have different objectives in mind and it's up to the player who to support. Some of the characters will even try to bribe you in order to get what they want.\nMoney is one of the most important resources in the game: it can make your life easier. Tired of using public transport? Buy a fancy car! But you also need to feed your family and money can help with that, too. Your wealth defines your social status: many quests will be unavailable if you are poor (and vice versa). In addition, other characters will treat you differently, depending on your social status.\nWe try to make gameplay as diverse as possible: there are a lot of unique minigames in LawLawLand. From moving crates on a factory to investigating the crime scene \u2014 every major quest comes with unique gameplay mechanics.\nThe core gameplay element is lawmaking. In LawLawLand there are two parties at the Parliament: one always votes \"yea\" and the other \"nay\". The votes are divided exactly in half and the final decision is always up to the player. Sometimes the laws that pass can actually help people, and sometimes they can help you make some money. There are many factions that will try to manipulate the main character or seduce him with money. In LawLawLand money always comes first. Well, right after your decisions, of course.\nWe have a talented development team that wants to engage in the game full time. But now there is no such opportunity, so we need your help. We have relatively small requests: we work from home from different countries. We don\u2019t need to rent an expensive office or pay big salaries: we just want to be able to calmly develop Law Law Land without worrying about tomorrow. If we exceed the required amount, we can hire extra and make Law Law Land even better (we have ideas that we cannot implement in the current budget). We plan to complete the game in a year and release Law Law Land in fall 2020.\nWe have a complete vertical slice of the game on our hands: all key mechanics are ready. A script has been written, we have a big living city, and all the characters are ready - all that remains is to complete Law Law Law Land. Approximately 1/3 of the game is ready. Many quests and mini-games are ready. Almost all graphic assets are rendered. The mechanics of making laws and changing the city works. And we also have an artificial intelligence system that controls every resident of Law Law Law Land: they go to work, shop in grocery stores, eat and sleep, depending on the time of day.\nYou can also check out our stretch goals here:\nEven more minigames: even more minigames and activities! Minigames will be even more diverse and use more unique mechanics.\nConsole ports: additional finance would help us expand the list of platforms. We love consoles and dream to bring Law Law Law Land to PS4, Xbox One and Nintendo Switch.\nThe town extended: to reduce the amount of work, so far we decided to not include some additional storylines. But if we get more resources for development, the city will become even larger, new buildings and new side quests associated with them will appear.\nMore customization options: new cars, new outfits and even an ability to customize interior in your house.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOur project is pretty big at scope.

If so, let us introduce you to Transport INC. a game where you can do all those things and more!\n\n  Transport INC. is a game about management, competition, economy but above all about logistics. The player gets to run a starting logistics company and skillfully maneuver it to the top.\n  Visit us on steam and join our growing community\nConnect the capitals and major cities of European or American nations. Watch the economic situation and defeat your opponents in Transport INC! You will experience what it feels like to face constantly changing traffic conditions. Is there a strike in Paris? Redirect your vehicles! Is there a football finals in Barcelona? Supply the lines with more vehicles.\n\n\n  The job of a company CEO is never easy. You'll have to deal with various unexpected events like strikes, natural disasters and more that might make or break your company. It's up to you to steer your company through these difficulties like a naturally born leader or see your company ruined and bankrupt.\nThe game world changes constantly on its own and you will feel yourself become increasingly part of it. Complain about annoying taxes and border control policies or evade them through different routes.\n\n  The whole world with its major cities will be available for you. Have you always wanted to do business in Paris? Build your first depot there and gradually expand to other cities, states, countries and finally to a world where everyone will know your company name.\n All passengers and cargo you transport will travel from one city to another. The better you know your cities, the more passengers you'll be able to satisfy. Passengers in each city have their own needs and as you keep transporting them, you will find out more about their needs. All cities also have their tags which can further affect demands or trigger various events.\n  As the director of a transport company, you'll have to provide your customers with the most modern and comfortable vehicles. A satisfied customer is a paying customer. That's why we've prepared various vehicles, from busses to aircraft to trains inspired by real vehicles. From a rattling old van to the most modern models where passengers will feel as if they are lying on a cloud.\nEvery vehicle has its own characteristics, pros, and cons.\n  As the CEO, you will have control of all the money there will be as well as an extensive overview of the statistics that will always help you know what your earnings are and what causes you the biggest losses. Consequently, it will be up to you to choose what to invest your money in to achieve the greatest profit.\n\n  In Transport INC: you will be confronted with other transportation companies. Competition can sometimes be an annoyance, especially when they offer better services than your company. Never mind if you can't catch up, there are other alternatives. Drag them to your level with industrial sabotage. You will be able to obstruct competing companies' progress and reduce their credibility and popularity. Sabotage your opponents in many ways such as puncturing tires, burning cars, staining their name with a marketing campaign or spraying graffiti on their vehicles. The ends justify the means, sometimes it is necessary to get your hands dirty.\n\nWe need your help bringing the full experience of a transportation company to life. Our stretch goals will make our game even more complex and enjoyable. With your help and support, we can make this game experience like no other. \n\n  We are a team of developers, artists, and foremost game enthusiasts. Our studio is located in Slovakia. While each of us like their own game genres, there is one we all share our love for - management/simulation games. This project is a perfect fit for mixing our own ideas (and your ideas too) with good old transport management games we played and loved as kids.\nTo bring all of these ideas into the game world, we need to grow our team. From the start of the development, our team has already nearly doubled in size. With new people that fall into our train of thought, we can bring more ideas, more know-how, and solutions to our game.\n   We're really grateful to be able to share our game with you through this Kickstarter campaign.\nVisit us on steam and join our growing community", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWith a good publisher at our back and a dedicated and talented team, there are no major risks ahead.\nEvery project is a challenge and this one is no exception.

With a big ensemble cast and a vibrant colorful style, Knight & Beard is an all ages book with themes of empathy, friendship, and more.\nRead Knight & Beard on Tapas, Webtoon, and Comixology!\n Volume 1 picks up with Knight and Beard performing a series of seemingly simple tasks. Unable to be trusted with actual guard duty, the two are found performing at a puppet show, wrangling up stray pigs, and just trying to keep out of trouble. But the mismatched pair can't help but wreak havoc wherever they go! Particularly Knight who has an aggressive determination to prove herself as a hero to potential naysayers around her. \nKnight and Beard Issue One, pages 10-13\nHowever, as Friendship Day, the world's most celebrated holiday approaches, people from all over the globe come pouring into the city, and Knight and Beard have to step up to perform their duties as guards. As the festival nears, the two start encountering all sorts of people: new friends, old foes, and a legendary hero. \nAt its core, Knight & Beard is a story of empathy and love. And Volume 1 marks the beginning of this journey that our titular characters take to understand themselves, each other, and the world around them. \nKnight & Beard Issue Five, pages 21 and 22\n Knight & Beard Volume 1 will collect the first seven issues of Knight & Beard.

With this Kickstarter, we'd really like to be able to pay him a fair wage for all the work that he's done for us.\nIn addition, we couldn't have put together a book of this size to print without the help of Rhiannon R.S, who we also hope to pay through the success of this campaign.\nAny additional earnings will go towards stretch goals and to the production of future issues of Knight & Beard.\n Described as a real life buddy comedy, long time friends Tara Kurtzhals and Sarah Bollinger met during college and instantly began collaborating on creative projects. Best known for their auto-bio comic Girls Have A Blog on Webtoon, these two young women have used their experiences as friends to inspire their stories of empathy, friendship, and more.  \n Author/Illustrator of The Whatever Chronicles and This is Jim.

This venture features a balance of immersive story, as well as a mini game to progress both relationships and dialogue. But Love Mythos isn\u2019t just pure titillation (not that there\u2019s anything wrong with that, amirite?). As the main character, you can help guide your fellow wounded companions through rehabilitation, or let them slip into bitterness and revenge. Your decisions, your words, your actions shape the entire world and who these fey will come to be.\nThis is an indie game created from the love of a very small team. Our goal is to create a dynamic, immersive experience with story that leaves you wanting more, and enough game play to provide an engaging challenge. We hope to bring a new type of sexy to the table, one that\u2019s frank, honest and well-written. A type of sexy where fetishes aren\u2019t shamed or vilified, and there\u2019s a little som\u2019something for everyone. We believe there\u2019s a real demand out there for erotica with substance, which is exactly what Love Mythos will provide.\nYou, an independent selkie just enjoying life in the Ocean, have been captured by the strange creatures called humans. Kept in darkness without your precious skin, you\u2019re sure it\u2019s the end when suddenly a team of rescuers sweep in and take you away.\nThey whisk you off to a hidden island; but not just any island. You find yourself at a rehabilitation center for fey who have been hurt by humans. And while you are not grievously wounded, the rescuers couldn\u2019t recover your skin. You are now stranded on land, with no way to ever get home.\nFrom there you meet the inhabitants of the island, and can choose to interact with them, or not. There is a large degree of freedom in this game for you to shape the world how you want. You can pursue a character\u2019s entire story line, unlock an ending, then go back and play another. Or you can take turns engaging multiple characters, learning about their past and what brought them to Sanctuary Island. The world is your oyster.\nOur demo can be found HERE \n\n This game is centered around the story and unlocking multiple endings amongst the eight love interest. What you choose to say, or choose not to say, has more effect than you know. However, the gameplay is just as important. Losing, winning, and getting a high score in the puzzle game is what will allow you to progress and unlock more chapters.\n\u00b7         Choose how you want your main character to be represented, with Male Pronouns, Female Pronouns, or They/Them!\n\u00b7         8 love interests to choose from, 4 female and 4 male, hailing from all over the world. Craving a beefcake bara daddy? Check. Looking for a total nerd with killer hair? Check. Whatever your flavor, you\u2019ll find something you like here.\n\u00b7         25+ in-game locations that you can explore with the other inhabitants of the island. Swim in the ocean with a mermaid, run through a meadow with a centaur, go to physical therapy with a minotaur. There are even special, hidden locations unlocked through certain endings.\n\u00b7         Interact with mythological creatures from all over the world, ranging from Alkonosts to Manticores!\n\u00b7         19+ unlockable endings, with drastically different outcomes. You can save characters, or send them teetering over the edge.\n\u00b7         Friendship options in case doing the down and dirty isn\u2019t your scene. Aro and Ace are welcome in our party.\n\u00b7         A bubble-shooter game, with consequences to characters and the storylines you\u2019ve unlocked so far.\n\u00b7         A catchy, mood-driven sound track guaranteed to pull you in and immerse you in the world of Love Mythos.\nLove Mythos came into being approximately three years ago and has been in serious production for over a year. So far, we have the script almost completed, finished character designs, half of the backgrounds, most of the OST, the visual novel engine, and the core of the mini-game experience. \nWe still need to finish the ending game cards, the sex scenes, the final draft of the OST and any other last-minute additions that will let the game really breathe. Once that is completed, there\u2019s also the incredibly important bug testing, which we want to be thorough with considering we are using an AI function in our mini-game.\n Our game is Greenlit and will be available on steam when we launch! \n\nLove Mythos is a passion project of an incredibly dedicated group of individuals, being produced at our own expense. A successful campaign would allow us to focus on putting out a great product, without having to worry about the lights being shut off.\n\u00b7         Greater output of assets without distraction of other freelancing projects.\n\u00b7         Additional help able to be hired, should it be needed.\n\u00b7         Handle the expenses that come with creating a business, including release game costs and fees.\n\u00b7         Creating a one of a kind, story driven, inclusive experience with unabashedly well-written erotica.\n\u00b7         The diagram below illustrates how any crowdfunding support will be allocated for the completion of Love Mythos: Sanctuary Island:\n Of course we will be pleased as punch (you know, if you\u2019re into that) just to fully fund this project, but these goals are in case you guys take us above and beyond our original scope. After all, anything\u2019s possible with enough pr0n! \nAdditional Splash art for each chapter between main character and love interests! \n Currently our games NSFW scenes focus more on the Love Interest rather than the plumbing of the player character. However, should this goal be hit, there will be three completely different sex scenes written for each pronoun set in the game. \n Who needs more porn? YOU DO! Should we reach this stretch goal, we will include additional splash art for the NSFW scenes for every love interest. \n\nWant to find out more about your waifu or husbando? Hitting this stretch goal will provide extra chapters for each love interest, involving a flashback from their life before the island. \n As much fun as it is getting them naked, it\u2019s also fun to dress the love interests up. Should we hit this stretch goal, each character will get custom accessories and looks as prizes for obtaining high scores in the mini game. \n Although we dearly love our main cast of characters, we realize that just 8 choices may not be enough to scratch everyone\u2019s itch. Should we hit this stretch goal, all backers will be able to vote for a secret, unlockable character to be added to the game. This new character will be fully fledged, with the same amount of chapters as the original cast. The choices are:\nSkol Z\u2019kiy: This slime girl heralds from the very cold wastes of Russia. She\u2019s sweet, shy, and a bit slippery.\n\nWapenzi: This sentient, intelligent gorilla is as handsome as he is charming. The scholarly fey was brought to the island after being shot by the humans he trusted and lived with.\n (sorry no sketches for Wapenzi yet QoQ)\nTagata Tino\u2019ese: A lovely lady cyclops heralding from the Polynesian belt. She is the epitome of a gentle giant, although she carries two massive clubs. One in her hand, and the other between her legs. \nWell you did it. If you\u2019re going to have options, you want all of them, gosh darn it. All backers will vote to unlock a 2nd hidden character from the list above.\n You did it...EVEN MORE. You proved that you really can have it all. All three of the previously listed hidden characters will be fully realized and added to the game, bringing the total up to eleven possible love interests and twenty-five different endings. \n Wow, you like us. You really like us! This stretch goal will include character specific mini games for each love interest. That\u2019s 11 different games inside of a game. That\u2019s some inception-level shenanigans. \n\n\n A \"Thank You\" from the Squid Sins Squad Team on our Kickstarter page as well as a Kickstarter exclusive Wallpaper.  \nFor the first 50 at this level receive the previously mentioned rewards plus the actual game and a thank you with your name in the credits!\nSame as the early bird, just a little bit later! \n For the first 25 at this level!

We build a turtle religion!?\nRecorded 01/30, this shows early alpha footage.\nAbbey Games, the creator of Reus and Renowned Explorers, is back with an all-new single-player god game, Godhood. \nAs a tribal god, create your own religion, inspire your tribe\u2019s growth, convert unbelievers and become the greatest god of all. \nWhile channeling the titans of yore, such as Black & White and Populous, Godhood sets out to revive the PC strategy god game genre in it\u2019s own unique way: by allowing you to truly craft your own one-of-a-kind religion. \nCraft your religion as a tribal god.\nChoose virtues, vices, rituals and religious dogmas.\nInspire a group of heroic disciples to spread your will, without direct control.\nWatch your holy temple site grow over generations from an isometric perspective.\nDefeat enemy disciples in ritual conflict to convert worshippers and power up.\nEarly Access release planned for May 2019 on PC (Windows / Mac / Linux), priced at \u20ac25.\nFull release later in 2019, priced at \u20ac30, with post-release content and DLC support planned for years.\n\nPray to the Social Stretch Gods and earn their blessings!\nTo honor the Social Stretch Gods...\nTo honor Twi'Xl, goddess of Twitter, retweet this tweet!\nTo honor Rednit, god of Reddit, join the Abbey Games subreddit!\nTo honor Yutteph, god of Youtube, share the Godhood Kickstarter video!\nUnlocked so far:\n FREE copy of Reus for all \u20ac20+ backers (received once campaign ends)!!\n FREE copy of Renowned Explorers for all \u20ac20+ backers (received once campaign ends)!!\n Wallpapers of all 3 Social Stretch Gods. Find them HERE.\n Forum Avatars of all 3 Social Stretch Gods. Find them HERE.\n In-Game Dedication Statue of Rednir.\nCREATE YOUR RELIGION\nBe a war god and prove that power is the greatest virtue! Accept treasured sacrifices as a god of greed. Bless harvests as a fertility goddess. Or cleanse body, soul and sinners as a chastity god. Mix and match to create your unique religion.\nLEAD YOUR DISCIPLES\nDisciples are your most powerful worshippers. They specialize in a class and power up their abilities by performing rituals. Disciples have a mind of their own, and are not under your direct control. Use divine inspirations to sway their actions to your liking. But keep their faith high or they might ignore you... The blasphemous sinners!\nGOD COMMANDMENTS\nSelect God Commandments to set what your religion considers a virtuous ideal or a loathsome vice. God Commandments unlock unique temples, rituals and god powers, and alter the personality of your disciples forever.\nPREPARE FOR CONFLICT\nDisciples can level up stats and abilities by performing rituals. Design these rituals to develop your disciples, and inspire the construction of the elaborate temples to perform these rituals in.\nTHE SACRAMENT\nProve you are the greatest god by defeating rival deities in turn-based rpg combat. You have no direct influence on how disciples choose to fight; instead, prepare them with the right skills to create powerful combos and take advantage of opponents' weaknesses to ensure victory.\nNot all battles are won with blades: use wise words, intimidation or even songs to sway your opponent's beliefs.\nTHE WORLD OF GODHOOD\nSend your disciples out to explore the world and convert other tribes. Procedural generation of the world ensures challenging surprises each playthrough. Clash with the Mesoamerican deities that have staked their claims, and explore a mythical world of nature spirits, strange magic and gods. \nMAKE IT YOURS\nMake your religion truly yours. Design your god. Decide what your worshippers call themselves and what they believe. Customize how they look and dress. Adorn your temples with your symbolic dedications, such as bats, swords, the sun or cats.\nThe goal of Godhood is to become the greatest god of all. To do so, you must watch over your tribe and inspire them to greatness. Here's how:\nGodhood progresses over a series of in-game days which effectively act as turns. Each day your heroic disciples decide how to best spend their time at your temple site. Depending on their character traits and faith in you, they might diligently perform a ritual, laze about, socialize with other disciples, get into fights etc. Only by inspiring their actions will you make sure they act in their own best interests.\nMaking vengeance a virtue makes your disciples stronger, but can lead to fights\nEach day, use your divine inspirations and god actions to lead your tribe. With divine inspirations, inspire your disciples to perform the rituals you've designed. These rituals increase their power, gain them unique specializations and provide the tribe with valuable resources.\nDivine inspirations are only as strong as your disciples' faith, so do not be surprised when a low-faith disciple ignores or even goes against your divine word. High-faith disciples have a chance of excelling in tasks you inspire them to perform.\nTo inspire faith, take heed of disciples\u2019 prayers. Violent disciples pray for glorious victory in combat, while tired disciples pray for a well-deserved rest. Make their wishes come true and their faith will soar.\nFaith is also increased by your glory. Glory shows how great your worshippers believe you to be; high glory increases disciples' faith and boosts their rituals. Glory fades over time, and once it's gone your godhood will decrease. If your godhood reaches 0 you lose the game \nAt any time you can choose to send your disciples on a mission to neighboring tribes, to convert that tribe from their false gods and restore your glory.\nYour disciples will face off against several teams of enemy disciples; each victory granting rewards and glory. Overpower all enemy teams to convert the tribe. Defeat will lower your disciples' faith, so be careful how far you push them.\nConverted tribes will pay tribute, especially if their culture matches your religion, and become a starting point for new missions, allowing you to explore further into the world.\nThe sacrament is the turn-based conflict in which disciples prove your greatness to unbelievers through physical combat, powerful speeches or even beautiful songs.\nYou decide the abilities and specializations your disciples have through the rituals you've designed and the choices you've made when leveling them up. But the disciples themselves decide how to best use their skills; you have no direct control over them.\nAhmanu tries to work through her nerves on her first Mission\nObtain victory by preparing rituals to power up your disciples, forming combos between your disciples' abilities and taking advantage of enemy weaknesses. Divine inspirations can be used to focus a disciple on using specific abilities, but their faith will determine how effective this proves to be.\nGaining more worshippers increases your 'god level'. At certain levels you may select a god commandment which becomes a focus of your religion. Each commandment has a moral opposite and choosing one will abhor the other. Examples are War & Peace or Greed & Charity.\nCommandments change disciples' personalities, turning some into virtuous paragons of the commandment and others into viceful sinners who disagree with the commandment.\nLust & Chastity\nCommandments unlock unique structures such as War's coliseum or Greed's gold hoard. Inspire their construction to unlock their powerful rituals. Commandments also unlock new god actions, new ways for you to influence the minds of your worshippers,which open up unique new strategies. War's holy raid god action, for example, inspires the tribe to raid neighboring tribes for loot! Commandments have many more effects, from unlocking special disciple abilities to triggering unique events.\nYour warmongering disciples will pray to you for holy raids on other tribes\nDisciples sometimes argue about how to interpret your commandments. By taking sides, rewarding or punishing your disciples you can further determine the dogma of your religion and unlock even more new tools for you to use.\nDevelop your playstyle by mixing and matching commandments, expand your temple site and rituals to power up your disciples, keep their faith high so they are ready for their missions, defeat other deities to convert their worshippers and grow your power. Become the greatest god of all.\nGodhood's simulation of religion has been a truly unique and exciting design challenge. In Inside Godhood we open up about that design process and go in-depth on the game's systems. We'll continue to post new Inside Godhood's during and after this campaign.\nInside Godhood 01: Creating your Religion\nInside Godhood 02: Your Disciples\nInside Godhood 03: The Sacrament\nInside Godhood 04: Your Rituals\nInside Godhood 05: The Mission\nInside Godhood 06: The Big Idea\nWe are a small independent Dutch developer, 10 people strong, that has been making strategic management games since 2011. We pride ourselves in making management games for hardcore strategists, whimsical storytellers and newcomers to the genre alike.\nWe have released two games: Reus and Renowned Explorers, for which we made a bunch of post-release content. Over the years we've established the 'Abbey tone': a combination of colorful and vibrant look and feel with deeply engaging mechanics that take skill and experience to master.\nOf course, we've grown and learned a lot since we started so many years ago, and we're continuing to use this experience to make each of our games better than the last.\nSince Reus we haven't been able to stop thinking about making another god game. One that truly touches on the role religion plays in human culture, and makes you the creator of your own religion. We hope you'll come to share our vision and help us make it a reality.\nRight, I remember Reus / Renowned Explorers!\nThat's great! A big thanks to anyone that supported our previous games. We hope you enjoyed playing them as much as we enjoyed making them. We've learned a lot of lessons along the way and believe Godhood couldn't have happened without your support and enthusiasm for our games.\nWe've been working on Godhood for a while now. Development up until an Early Access release has been fully funded and we're working hard to release in Early Access in May 2019. A full release will follow sometime later in 2019.\nBut our vision for the game is massive. There are as many ideas for interesting religious expression as there are people. In order to allow you to live out your godhood, we want to add as many religious ingredients and mechanics as we can cram into a single game. And for that we'll need your help.\nHitting the funding goal allows us to allocate resources to create all the components required to fulfill one fantasy we've heard fans asking for over and over again: to become an ancient eldritch god with their own dark and secretive cult.\nEmbrace madness... and tentacles!\nOf course, being an eldritch horror is only one fantasy of godhood. The base game will give you a ton of other options, and if we exceed the funding goal we'll have the resources needed to create even more for you to mix and match into all sorts of unique religions.\nRegardless of the success of the Kickstarter, we want to support Godhood for years to come: expanding on its extensive base with all sorts of new systems and religious expressions.\nWe know that pledging your support now means putting a lot of faith in us. For this we offer you our utmost gratitude, and these rewards as thanks for your support.\nRewards Explanations:\nDigital copy of Godhood: This will be delivered to you as either a Steam code or DRM-free through GOG at the game's Early Access release, May 2019.\nBacker-exclusive Holy Site Centers: A visual skin for your Holy Site center to use in-game. The 'Evil' version gets you a nefarious-looking skin as well. They have no gameplay mechanics tied to them, but look real sleek. These will not be made available after the Kickstarter. \n'Art of Godhood' digital artbook: A Steam code for a beautiful artbook. Go in-depth on the creation process of the game's artstyle, marvel at stunning illustrations, and feast on hidden gems of lore.\n'Tunes of Godhood' digital soundtrack: A Steam code for the full Godhood original soundtrack. Enjoy the soothing sounds of nature and divinity at your leasure. Take a listen to a preview:\nAlpha & Beta access: We've been running a limited-invites alpha program for Godhood, but with this reward you're guaranteed to be a part of all alpha and beta tests. Take note: We can't guarantee a specific amount of alpha & beta moments until launch; we'll schedule in whatever development demands. They are time limited, and usually last about a weekend. \n3 Backer-Exclusive Dedications: Three visual skins for dedication statues: 'Kickstarter Backer', 'Golden Rivaleux' and 'Reus Rock Giant'. They have no gameplay mechanics tied to them, but sure look spiffy. These will not be made available after the Kickstarter. \nName an enemy disciple: Name one of the enemy disciples players will face when they explore the world of Godhood. We'll give you a list of enemy gods. You choose which your character worships, and give them a cool tribal name. We reserve the right to ask you for another name in case its content is not deemed appropriate for the game. \nDesign an in-game dedication: Design a dedication statue with us, to be placed in-game! You'll provide us with a couple sentence description or a sketch of the statue and Marlies will work it out to put in-game. Dedications have no gameplay mechanics tied to them. We reserve the right to ask you for another description in case its content is not deemed appropriate for the game. \nDesign an adversary deity: Design one of the adversary deities players will face to prove they are the greatest god! You'll select what type of deity they are from a list, then provide us with a name and a couple sentence description, or even a sketch. We'll work with you to make sure the deity fits the world of Godhood. We reserve the right to ask you for another description in case its content is not deemed appropriate for the game. \n\"I'd love to help out, but have no credit card!\"\nHi! Thanks so much for being interested in backing! We will set up a 'late backer' solution after the campaign, so you won't miss out. For this we'll be using PayPal, which will make pledges without a credit card totally possible. We hope to see you then!\nThank you so much!\nWhether this is the first time you've heard of Abbey Games, have been with us from our humble beginnings with Reus, or have eagerly traversed all the post-release expeditions of Renowned Explorers, we thank you for enabling us to make the games we, and hopefully you as well, have a passion for playing.\nThank you so much for checking out the Kickstarter. We plan on supporting Godhood with new content and gameplay for years to come, and we hope you'll be a part of that journey. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our first Kickstarter, but our third large-scale PC management game we release. The game's development is well underway and fully funded up until our Early Access release in May 2019.\n\nVideo game development is a turbulent process that can hold unexpected obstacles. This means there is a chance development will take a little longer than planned. If this does happen, we will of course let you know well in advance.\n\nThe initial release will be Early Access, in order to give us time to get your feedback, establish a solid base, and then expand that base with new content. We have no projected final release date, as the success of the Kickstarter could actually mean we have more funds to expand the game more than we predict, but we do know we'll be fully releasing Godhood in 2019.\n\nIn order to avoid hangups regarding reward delivery, we have decided to not include any physical rewards.

Lovecraft\nBy  night we came, descending upon the old house like the vultures that we  are. They say the manor is full of valuables and relics. They also say  Lovecraft is mad, believing his writing to be more than mere fiction.  Let's hope that isn't true... and why the front door was  left unlocked. \nAll Manor of Evil takes players inside the mind and abode of HP  Lovecraft. As players pilfer and steal ancient relics, unseen forces awaken and madness stirs. Beyond the larceny at hand, each player has an agenda of their own. Some want only to survive the night, while others wish to call forth an elder god eager to devour the players... or the world.\n \"The most merciful thing in the world, I think, is the inability of the human mind to correlate all its contents. \" - H.P. Lovecraft\nThe LUNATIC pledge of All Manor of Evil includes upgraded awakening and madness tokens, as well as more relics, roles, and, yes, gods. More importantly, this pledge adds monster cards and arcane relics. Monsters are added to the Manor deck during setup and trigger game-altering effects when they are drawn. Arcane relics feature a silver border. Some role and relic cards reference these powerful objects, each of which is unique. Lastly, this pledge level includes additional components to allow for up to six players to play!\n \"I have harnessed the shadows that stride from world to world to sow death and madness.\" - H. P. Lovecraft\nThe contents of Madness Stirs will be comprised of stretch goals unlocked throughout this campaign. Backers will receive this expansion for supporting this campaign. It will be available in limited quantities after the campaign at a cost directly from Kolossal. This expansion will contain more complex monsters, relics, roles, and other content not available in the retail version of the game.\n \"Wise men have interpreted dreams, and the gods have laughed.\" - H.P. Lovecraft\nTake a look at what those who have had an early look at All Manor of Evil think about the game!\n All Manor of Evil is the 2nd Mikro campaign from Kolossal Games and the 9th overall campaign from Kolossal Games. While Kolossal is new to the industry, we hit the ground running, armed with the  knowledge of industry best practices, experienced partners, and  wonderful games. Our first game Western Legends   is in the process of fulfillment. We believe in open and honest  communication and will share all info as we receive it with our  backers. \nThe game is designed by Kolossal's own Travis R. Chance (Heroes Wanted, Path of Light and Shadow, Legendary: Buffy the Vampire Slayer) with haunting art from Mike Riiven (Omen: A Reign of War). Though a game in our Mikro line, it packs a punch with highly interactive play, as well as an interesting take on the very popular Lovecraft theme.\nOur team is led and supported by industry and marketing experts.  We have a machine that works, fueled by amazing games that are designed,  developed, and illustrated by incredibly talented people. The game is  easy to learn while providing interesting, diverse, and tense game play  each game, combining familiar mechanisms in a unique, new way.  \nWe are committed to begin fulfillment to backers of this game  before it is made available in retail. Components and materials for the  game are in the final stages of completion upon launch. All files will  be uploaded to our manufacturing partner within one week of the  campaign's ending. This ensures timely delivery to our backers. \n Kolossal does not sell to online discounters. Backers will receive all of our games at a lower cost and before the retail release of the game. Further, direct sales via the  Kolossal website will only be to US customers.\nBy backing at ANY pledge level through our campaign, you will receive, at no extra cost, the Madness Stirs expansion. This expansion will be comprised of stretch goals unlocked throughout the  campaign and will only be available directly through Kolossal (at a  cost) after the campaign in limited quantities. This expansion will only be overprinted by 500 units for the initial release of the game. We have many exciting and interactive goals  planned for those who are backers of Kolossal's ninth official release! \nPlayers take the role of thieves that have all broken into the opulent manor of writer H.P. Lovecraft. Upon entry, they discover valuable relics of strange origin throughout the manor. Little do they know, their mere touch has stirred ancient and otherworldly forces. At least one of them will be driven mad, but who among those remaining will escape with the most relics... and their sanity?\nBackers wanting more info about how to play the game may peruse our draft rule book link here. We also invite them to read a step-by-step description of the game below.\nAll Manor of Evil is played over a number of game rounds. Each Round has three phases.\nSelect Actions\nResolve Actions\nEnd of Round\n                                        SELECT ACTIONS\nEach player has 4 Action cards that they will choose to play one of each round. Each Action card has a Title, Initiative Order, Card Action, and Room Action.\nEach player simultaneously selects one Action card from their hand and places it face down in their play area. When a player places their Action card face down they immediately return any face up Action cards to their hand. This return step will be skipped on the first round of play.\nAll Players simultaneously reveal their Action cards. Any players who selected the same Action card as at least one other player take a Madness token from the supply. \nThe player(s) that selected the Action card with the lowest initiative number resolves their Action card first. If more than one player chose the same Action card, players with the same initiative number will resolve their actions in clockwise order starting at the Lantern token. Players that chose the same action also receive one madness token. \n                                       RESOLVE ACTIONS\nWhen resolving an Action card, first resolve the Card Action and then the Room Action.\nRoom actions require the player to steal a relic from one of the rooms on the Manor Board. Players MUST steal a relic from one of the rooms listed on their Action card. Depending on the other players actions there may not available Relics to steal during the Room Action step and in this case the player does not steal a relic.\nOnce a Relic is stolen, place or remove Awakening tokens, gain or lose Madness tokens, and resolve any indicated Special effect on the card.\nThe Madness Value and Relic Value will be considered at the end of the game. Players will only know for certain the values on the top card of each player's Cache. The uncertainty of just who has the most madness adds to the tension of the game!\n                                                END OF ROUND\nAfter all players have resolved their action cards, the round ends. Players check to see if any Elder Gods have 6 or more Awakening Tokens and if so the game ends. If not, the player with the Lantern Token passes it to the next player in clockwise order and the next round begins.\n                                                   GAME END\nA game of All Manor of Evil will end in one of three possible ways. \nDuring set up, two Clock Cards will be added to the relic deck. When the second clock card is revealed, the game immediately ends.\nIf one Elder God has 6 or more Awakening tokens at the end of a round. \nIf more than one Elder God is Awakened at the end of a Game Round, then all players are devoured and nobody escapes the Manor.\n                                   DECLARING A WINNER\nWhen the game ends each player will reveal their Role card and resolve all abilities.\nIf an Elder God was awakened, resolve any Awakened ability on the Elder God's card. \nAssuming that the thieves have not destroyed the world by awakening several ancient cosmic gods, the remaining players will total their Madness and Relic Values.\nPlayers will total their Madness tokens and the Madness Value of all cards in their Cache. The player with the most Madness has delved too deep into the dark and unknown and will never be the same. This player is eliminated.\nThe remaining players will then compare the total value of stolen relics to determine who among them was the most successful relic thief.\nIn addition to the standard game for 3 or more players, each copy of All Manor of Evil includes rules and components for a solo and 2 player variant. These Lovecraft rules can be found in the rule book.\nKickstarter is the world's largest funding platform for creative projects. Every month, tens of thousands of people pledge millions of dollars to creative projects in dozens of categories.\nA person who supports a project is called a \"backer.\" The process of giving money to this project is called a \"pledge.\"\nIn return for your pledge, we (the creators of the campaign) are able to offer \"rewards,\" depending on the amount you pledge.

Command Points, Battle Points, Knowledge Points are always useful even in small amounts, allowing the players to take lots of actions during their turn. Cards do also possess colors that when matched together can create powerful combos and trigger additional effects.\nHowever, such mechanic is not just tied to the hand you draw! Upgrading cities with buildings is also a key part of the game: once a building is erected it both generates resources and contributes in combos every turn. More complex strategies can really push the opponent in a corner, turn after turn!\nBut, if you were to prefer more straightforward plans... spectacular head-on attacks are an option too! Isn\u2019t it nice to spend those hard-earned Command Points on top tier cards, picking them together and unleash a mighty combo to your enemy? What a better way to break your opponent\u2019s morale than directly destroying one of their beloved cities?\nOh... yes, we know, we know. Sometimes annoying things like Troops could stand in your way to victory. Or maybe you just do not like to dent your shiny weapons. We got you covered on that too, it may appear a little expensive at first, but we are talking about wiping out an entire city, buildings and troops along with it in one swift move. Condemn a City with the mark of Volfyirion and let the dragon bring fear to the heart of your rival!\nDuring our Mysthea Kickstarter campaign, we received a ton of requests from our backers wondering if there was a chance to tell the story of the Volarees Guild\u2019s Dragon. We decided to set our new game in this amazing universe to finally tell the tale of the dreadful dragon Volfyirion.\nThe process of designing Volfyirion was extremely exciting. We took this opportunity to expand game lore and Mysthea history, while also working with Travis to create a Dragon that could fit this amazing universe. \nAt first we thought Volfyirion should be represented with its head up right, to better showcase its design and shape. After working on it a bit, we decided that it wasn\u2019t dynamic enough for a dreadful dragon. We tried to move the head aside but it didn\u2019t really enhance all the features of the dragon.\nThe dragon design was solid though, so we decided to work more on the pose. At first we tried to point Volfyirion\u2019s face upwards with all its tail down on the ground and its claws up in the air. We felt it was cool, but it wasn\u2019t much of a dragon posture. Lastly, we tried to take advantage of its peculiar shape and we developed the last pose on the right.\nWe gathered a lot of feedback and we understood that this pose was really appreciated. We believe that Volfyirion with its tail wrapped around its body and the menacing look is the one that represents it better and we decided to go down this route. \nThis pose showcases all its might and how dangerous it would be to face it. It's also really easy to grip, and that's a plus since the mini gets moved a lot on the Card Game!\nPLAY\n\nCheck out the final design and zoom on every detail with the interactive Volfyirion 3D model!\nWe know that a lot of mini painters are going to work on this mini, so we decided to see what the results could be and we asked Bellerofonte Art Studio powered by Kimera Models (Francesco Farabi, Pietro Balloni, Matteo Di Diomede) to paint a resin prototype of Volfyirion. The results are amazing. See for yourself!\nVolfyirion painted by Francesco Farabi\nAnother angle of his stunning work\nWe decided to create this Graphic Novel, illustrated by Eren Ar\u0131k, to engage with our community and to create the story that would lead to the events of this campaign video. \nThe plot has been community sourced, we have been giving each week choices to our readers on how the plot should've advance. This is the final result!\nYou can read it on our website!\nSixty years before the breakthrough which brought the Champions of Ilvash to the Five floating islands, the lands of Mysthea were a radically different place: the wars of the Somber Years just ended and at this point in time only two states were ruling the lands floating above Icaion. \nThese two states were the forces which during the Somber Years conquered all other smaller states, expanding their dominion over all known land. As they grew in power, the Kingdom of Ahatils and the Kitrean Empire, remained on the brink of conflict.\nWhile skirmishes and various small battles still took place at the border between the two forces, they persisted for the moment in a kind of truce while recovering from the previous conflict, and preparing for the inevitable great war between them to come.\nKing Retudran Ahatils, being too occupied with the happenings and potential troubles at the front as he was, was not interested in managing the lands he had already conquered during the Somber Years, viewing governance as a trivial and unimportant task to be delegated. In the King\u2019s heart, he remained more conqueror than ruler.\nAdministration of the newly conquered provinces was delegated to the King\u2019s trustworthy ex-military commanders who had showed ability in the field. As a reward for their services, the King would grant them a household name, and the power to manage and rule over certain provinces- granted that the King himself would retain true ownership of the lands. But in time it became clear that the provinces were terribly unruly and unlawful, and the King was interested neither in overseeing nor imposing his will or law. Therefore, each province became autonomous in its own decision making. And moreover, each province developed to be different from the next.\nThe King trusted his men to a certain degree, but he also felt the need to establish some method to ensure they would never play clever tricks on him. So, he established that each province should act as a watchdog of its neighbors, reporting directly to him in the event of any unusual whispers of trouble.\nIn the region of Rykalad there was once a powerful and proud kingdom that fought valiantly before losing the war against Ahatils during the Somber Years. This kingdom\u2019s capital, the city of Kyradar, was built over an intensely powerful anomaly which to this day remains active deep below the city. This anomaly amplifies the way in which Qoam resonates, allowing the former citizens of the conquered city to develop peculiar abilities such as the ability to forge objects with rare properties.\nThis kingdom\u2019s heritage was uniquely shaped by the presence of such a strong power. The capital together with its six satellite provinces was once a peaceful kingdom interested solely in scholarly pursuits and the study of Qoam manipulation.\nWhen King Athalis reached the region of Rykalad during the Somber Years, it became clear to him how dependent the city of Kyradar had become on its six provinces. He henceforth decided that the best way to conquer the region would be to first overtake these satellite cities and then proceed to siege the capital. \nHis strategy was victorious and after his conquest the former city of Kyradar devolved into wild and uninhabited ruins while the King\u2019s men ruled the region from the surrounding six cities. He could restore the city to its former glory after the war ended; there was no need to waste resources now. But when the war finally ended, the King had nearly forgotten about Kyradar and forsook the city where it lay in utter ruin.\nTwo Houses were assigned to manage these lands: the Volarees House and the Rorius House, each one with three cities under their control.\nLife in these areas was not much different from life in other conquered lands, with the two Houses ruling the lands and maintaining a watchful eye over each other\u2019s deeds. This continued until the ominous day that a terrible beast never before seen glided from the sky onto the ruins of Kyradar, likely attracted by the anomaly and the power it emanated.\nThe two Houses understood immediately that the beast- an incredible and fearsome dragon- was awesomely powerful and most certainly empowered by the energy from the anomaly.\nThe dragon remained settled in the ruins of that place while the two Houses cautiously sent scouts and explorers in attempts to comprehend the beast\u2019s nature. Those first encounters with the dragon were terrible: many men lost their lives to these meetings. But the two houses understood from these encounters that it might be possible to use Qoam manipulation to have the dragon under their own control. With further encounters and experiments, the Houses discovered they could tame the beast, and each House rushed to do this, both wanting to reach the terrible beast before the other won its favor.\nThe two Houses clashed into war, trying to stop the other from gaining control of the dreadful Volfyirion.\nWant to learn what happened after these events and how Volarees become the revered Guild of Nobility?

The game is being developed for Nintendo Switch and PC. Thief's Roulette takes the narrative heavy design of Visual Novels and combines it with immersive, first person Puzzle gameplay to create a unique gaming experience. With Thief's Roulette I hope to take the player on a journey through betrayal, deception, and trust. Player freedom through choices, building alliances or creating rivals will be the driving force of the game.\nSTORY\nThief's Roulette takes place in a far off future Earth, where people are no strangers to android life, body augmentation or any of the other concepts of a high-tech society. Our characters live with it every day, to them its the way things have always been. That is simply the world they inhabit, and it all takes a back seat to the terrible events that the characters must face.\nLady Luck's sign. Will you ever see her face?\nYou awake in a strange place surrounded by unfamiliar faces. You have all been kidnapped and forced to compete for your lives in a series of challenges, hosted by a mysterious woman calling herself Lady Luck. She claims you have all been taken to her Casino. When the group is split into 3 Teams you learn the horrible truth of this game. To win means to sentence your opponents to death. \nAll 15 Strangers were chosen for a reason. Lady Luck proclaims them to all be thieves, liars and con men. All things she despises. For her, they will perform in a game of both trust and deception. To win you must deceive yet you must also work together. But in a room full of liars, who can you trust? \nLADY LUCK\u2019S GAME\nBefore the games can begin, the 15 Contestants are randomly assigned to 3 Teams of 5. From there, they will enter their respective challenge rooms and attempt to complete the task the fastest. The catch, is that both 2nd and 3rd Place Teams will have to take part in the Marking Roulette. Members of the 2 teams are randomly Marked for Death. If you are ever Marked twice, you will be Executed.\nA party of 4, nothing but death could have led to this.\nThis means that if you are Marked and your Team gets 2nd Place, being Marked again means you die, if you are lucky and are not chosen, you live. However, for the 3rd Place Team, the Marking Roulette Spins Twice. Being in Third Place doubles your chance of being Marked and Killed.\nHe's just looking out for you, right?\nAfter every Round in the Challenge Rooms, the Teams are randomly scrambled once more. So you will not always be with the same teammates. All Marks will remain even after changing teams. You must complete all 7 of Lady Luck's Challenges. Whoever remains in the End may leave this place alive.\nOne last thing! When a Team gets 1st Place, one Player from that team is randomly selected to receive the Trade Token. The 3rd Place Team will have one Player randomly selected to receive the Reroll Token.\nThe Trade Token can only be used right after the Teams have been scrambled. With this Token you may swap places with anyone else on any Team. \nThe Reroll Token can only be used right after the Marking Roulette. With it, you may choose to Reroll the Marking process. Perhaps for a more ideal result.\nThese Tokens can only be used once. You are allowed to give, trade or steal Tokens. You are also not obligated to ever use them. That choice is yours. At certain points in the game You (the Player) will receive these Tokens. How, when, or if at all you choose to use them will have a major effect on the game\u2019s story.\nA rotating number Puzzle.\nIn Thief's Roulette there is heavy emphasis on exploration and discovery when it comes to the Challenges. In the Challenge Rooms you have full control of your character in a first person view. You can run, crouch and interact with things in your environment. These mechanics and more intend to make exploring the Challenge rooms as engaging as possible.\nHand/Eye/Mouth\nThese are your means of communicating and interacting with the world. My imaginary QA Testers calls it the HEM system, for Hand, Eye, and Mouth. Upon activation, you are given the ability to perform one of these 3 commands. This system is how all of the game\u2019s puzzles and mysteries are solved. They also allow for more common interactions.\n Hand: Use to touch things in the environment. You can pull levers, open doors, grab items or tap a character on the shoulder to get their attention.\n Eye: Use to focus on points of interest in the environment. Upon usage, your character gives an analysis of what they are seeing.\n Mouth: Use to talk or make noise.This is mainly for speaking with characters, but there are more clever uses for this option as well. I won't spoil what those are, so you\u2019ll just have to trust me!\nEvery one of the HEM options have additional uses that players will discover over the course of the game.\nA simple cipher\nAlong with the HEM System, and not only in the Challenge Rooms, you have ITEMS. Items are used to solve the various Puzzles of the game. They can be examined, some items can be combined together to form a new item, and some only have use outside of Challenge Rooms. During the moments you spend outside of Challenges, you will come across unique items that can be put to use in special ways. \nEach of the game's 7 Challenges have a Room that is unique visually, and in regard to their objectives. You will be required to carefully examine your environment, use items and tools found in the room, and solve logic puzzles.The 3 Teams are competing to complete these Challenges before the others. \nIt is worth noting that as the Player, your Team\u2019s placement is determined by choices you make, rather than a proficiency for puzzle solving. I don\u2019t want the story to be led by how fast you can rush through the gameplay! \nBreak Time\nThere is a Routine to Lady Luck\u2019s Game. On the First Day, the Contestants perform in 2 Challenges with short breaks in between. After both Challenges, the Players are given the rest of the day off. During these breaks, the Player is free from Challenges for the time being. Each Contestant has an assigned Room in the Living Quarters and are allowed to freely explore The Casino.\nEveryone is given their own room in Lady Luck's Casino.\nAfter Break Time is done, the contestants will awake to a new set of Challenges. 2 More for the Day and it's back to Break. After every day of Challenges, The Casino expands and new locations become accessible\nDuring Break Times you can investigate the Facility using your full range of skills (the HEM system). You can gather bits of backstory and clues about Lady Luck\u2019s Game and the outside World.\nYou may also speak with any of the living contestants. After all, they will be taking part in the Break as well. Gather more information about the characters you\u2019re stuck with, or simply call it a Day and get some sleep.\nSpecial events can happen during the Break, as your choices can lead to unique encounters with the other Characters. \nIf you're ever in need of assistance, ask one of your Teammates.\nFEATURES\nA gripping story of deception. Who you choose to align with may either lead to your death or your survival.\nHeavy Player Choices that can alter the path of the Story.\nMultiple Endings\nImmersive and Intricate Puzzles to Solve.\nA Natural approach to Difficulty: Any time during a Puzzle, you may ask your teammates for help. Players who want to take on the challenge with no clues can simply not ask for assistance.\nFully explorable 3D Environments and VN Style Artwork.\nA cast of unique characters with their own goals and personalities. Some are only out for themselves, others may have your back when the time comes.\nThe Main Character - Lady Luck mistakenly wiped too much of his memory. Lucky you.\nI will be Showcasing the rest of the Cast as the Campaign goes on! \n*Thief's Roulette will come with Very Partial Voice Acting if we do not hit the Final Goal.\n\u201cIs this a visual novel?\u201d\nI don\u2019t know. Maybe?\n\"What do you know?\"\nThief's Roulette is a game that I've wanted to do for years. Its inspired by some of my all time favorite games so I hope to do them justice. I believe Thief's Roulette is my chance to show my skills as a game designer and story teller. The game has gone through numerous revisions along this journey, but the 2 main themes have always stayed the same: Strangers forced to perform in a deadly game, and puzzle solving through exploration and discovery. \n\"Where is the demo?\"\nCurrently, the game is in its very early stages! A demo is not quite ready, but the majority of the game's gameplay features are in place, and functional (you can see this much in the Trailer). Still, some of the core features require more attention, so releasing it right now would likely hurt me more than it would help. My optimism made me think it'd be done by the time the Kickstarter launched, but it's not. Because of that, this first Demo will be released to all backers regardless of Tier. \nThis Demo will consist of the Cast waking up in Lady Luck's facility and learning about the Game they will take part in. You'll be taken through one full Challenge Room, and the Demo will end after a Marking Roulette. You'll get to meet every character and get a feel for the game. The demo will be out 1-2 months after the Campaign. This gives me the time to use those funds to polish what I have now, and make sure your first time in Thief's Roulette is as memorable as possible.\nSome early concept art, more characters are on the way\n\"Who are you?\"\nMy name is Malik Brown, I tend to go by hiromu656 on the internet. I am an Artist and Animator from Chicago. As an animator my primary focus was short, hand drawn stories, but I also enjoy working in 3D. I have a passion for art and I've been playing video games my whole life. For some years now, I've been creating small scale games, and I think I'm finally ready for something big. I\u2019m the sole member of the Thief's Roulette team, so I am currently handling the Art, Story, and Development on my own. Music on the other hand, I am having made by my friends. They\u2019re working for free as of now and that never sat right with me. Hopefully with Kickstarter we can change that.\n\"How will the money be used?\"\nWell first, I know that a percentage of funds will go to Kickstarter. With the remainder, I will finally get to paying my sound friends. Since I\u2019m doing this solo at the moment, hiring a Programmer is the main priority. I\u2019m confident in my ability to create the Art and Assets, but handling code on top of that makes this process longer than it needs to be. A successful Campaign means I get to focus my attention on the Art, and we can get the game out much sooner. Although I am happy with the current character art, I want to have a chance to take them all under the knife once more. A full upgrade to all art assets, and especially the environment, is what I'd love to do. Success here, means that I can afford to.\nThat\u2019s about it. If you have any questions at all, ask away! Thank you for reading this far, and I hope you choose to support the project!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nCan't think of many risks, but challenges will surely pop up. As I've said on the main page, the Project's main hurdle is how I can balance the game's coding and all of the game's art as the sole developer. With enough funding I can hire a Programmer for the team so that I'm not wearing myself thin. The project is about 90% written out, characters sketched and all that good stuff. The hard part will be transferring all of that to the game world. I'm very well prepared on that front, but I know firsthand that things never go as smooth as you would hope.

That being said, here is what I have to show this time:"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #81", "update_userinfo": "Update", "update_content": "This will be a quick rundown of the progress I've made since the last update.\nI've been doing more work on the game's storytelling and how scenes flow. I've actually been remaking the way that cutscenes work after putting out that Backer Demo. It feels a bit choppy going from the free movement sections to the literal VN style scenes. I want to find a better way to make it all feel connected. Nothing to really show there, but it will be an important change when it's done. "}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #80", "update_userinfo": "Recent Progress Rundown", "update_content": "This will be a pretty short update. Much of what I've been working on isn't something that I'd like to show, so I will just talk about it.\nSince the last update I've been working primarily on non-challenge room environments. For example: what you see before you ever begin Thief's Roulette (Lady Luck's game), the facility as a whole, and the Dreams. Regarding those Dreams, if you've played or seen the recent Backer Demo, you will have gotten a glimpse of the dream visuals or at least my approach, but they do not represent the game's actual dreams. In case anyone is wondering, they are an important part of the game. The dreams have a reason and you will discover that when you play. ;)"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #79", "update_userinfo": "February recap and March plans", "update_content": "This month there was a lot of work done on getting the game presentable on all fronts. I've made improvements to character art, UI/menus, and many environments. There was technically a demo release this month as well, but I had to keep it backer only. That turned out to not be the worst thing, however, because backers had some very good feedback for me that greatly improved the game. So in the end it worked out, but I still would like to get a public demo released sooner rather than later.

Looks like we\u2019re going hunting for Dooley and our Stretch Goals!\nStretch goal 2 (underway) - Honey, I Shrunk The Detective\nA poorly-picked gift by Dooley leaves McQueen to traverse the corporate jungle. How did it get so dusty down here?\nStretch Goal 1 (hit!) - The Darkside Detective Anthology\nMcQueen and Dooley aren't the only people in Twin Lakes and they certainly aren't the only ones living interesting lives. The Anthology Case consists of a number of short shorts focused on a day in the life of other characters you've met in Season 1 \u2013 The Bloodwolves, Ghouley and McScream, and Raxa.\nYou might have thought that solving season 1\u2019s nine bizarre cases would have cleared the books on spooky crime in Twin Lakes, but you\u2019d have thought wrong. Those schmucks at Spooky Doorway have crafted a whole new season of paranormal puzzles for you to investigate, starting with finding Officer Dooley!\nThat\u2019s right, at the end of season 1, everyone\u2019s favourite character named Patrick Dooley, got himself lost in the Darkside\u2026 Only you and McQueen can save him. Heck, only you and McQueen will even look.\n\u201cBut guuuUUuuuuyyyss!\u201d we hear you cry, \u201cI didn\u2019t play season 1, I don\u2019t know what any of this means!\u201d - don\u2019t worry, you can play it right blooming now! We\u2019ve even set up a tier for people who want to buy both copies. But, if you\u2019d rather skip over season 1 (for some eldritch reason) then it\u2019s worth mentioning that The Darkside Detective is modelled off classic cartoons like The Simpsons, meaning it\u2019s a series of stand-alone stories. You can dive straight into season 2 right off the bat and start enjoying the award-winning comedy that has won the hearts of many. We\u2019ll even include a \u2018PREVIOUSLY ON\u2019 to bring you up to speed. Netflix ain\u2019t got squat on us.                                                 \nTry the first 2 cases of Season 1 for free!\n                                              \nThe Darkside Detective Season 2 will be available on Mac, PC, Linux and Nintendo Switch.\n     Where cultists crawl, where demons dwell, where the occult\u2026 occults? you\u2019ll find Detective Francis McQueen, of the criminally underfunded Darkside Division. \nWhen evil darkens the doorsteps of Twin Lakes City \u2013 hell, even when it just loiters around shop fronts or hangs out in shady alleyways \u2013 he\u2019s there, ready to investigate the cases that nobody else will. He is The Darkside Detective.     \n  The Darkside Detective is a classic point and click adventure game with a distinct sense of humour. Season 1 came with six cases and had three extra cases added post launch. Season 2 will also contain 6 cases, each containing 45 plus minutes game play.  \nJoin Detective McQueen and Officer Dooley as they investigate these bizarre cases ranging from the occult to the supernatural, anything is possible in this adventure game.\nTwin Lakes is just like any other American city \u2013 mean streets, twenty-four hour diners, trans-dimensional doorways\u2026 wait, no. No, that last thing isn\u2019t right. It is, in fact, far from right. But it is common in Twin Lakes.  \nSomething is wrong in the city, an evil exists here, overlapped but out of sync with the world as we know it. A place that shouldn\u2019t exist, but does. A place that goes unwritten about in their papers, full of things that go unjudged in their courts. A place that Lonely Planet described as \u201cIndescribable.\u201d  \nWhen flesh-hungry tentacles rise from the sewers, when the moon shines extra red, and when one sock goes missing from the dryer, you can bet that somehow the Darkside is involved\u2026  \nSeason 1\u2019s nine cases brought us across the city of Twin Lakes, investigating incidents at the local library, the subway, the museum, police station, the woods, local shops, homes and more. Season 2 takes us to places both familiar and new:\n Including a trip overseas\u2026\n ...to sunny old Ireland\nAnd, of course, we\u2019ll explore more of the Darkside itself...\nThe Darkside Division\nYou might ask how a city operates when the forces of evil are around every corner and in every coffee shop (hogging the nice window seats and bathroom stalls right when you need them). Well, ignorance is bliss and the people of Twin Lakes are pretty blissful. Most don\u2019t even believe anything strange is going-on. But thanks to people like Police Chief Scully and Detective McQueen there are a few precautions against the darkness \u2013 occult items are banned, vampires are on a no-fly list and there is the Darkside Division, the two-man operation responsible for enforcing the more esoteric rules of Twin Lakes and investigates strange goings-on across the city. McQueen and his sidekick Officer Dooley are, for better or worse, the first and last line of defence against things that go bump in the night (things that go bump during the day are the jurisdiction of another department).  \nChief Scully\nEven now McQueen still isn\u2019t sure what Scully witnessed to finally open her mind to his requests to start up the Darkside Division. For months she had been rejecting it over and over and suddenly, one day she called him into the office to approve it. She never explained why, but since then she\u2019s been funding his investigations and covering for him when things go slightly awry\u2026 She\u2019s from a prominent family in the city, and in fact, she\u2019s the new mayor\u2019s twin sister. Strangely, though, McQueen could swear he remembers her telling him she is an only child...     \nRaxa Anand\nRaxa is a student in Twin Lakes University (majoring in the occult and minoring in computer science). To help pay for her tuition fees, she\u2019s become an Inspooktor - a franchise of ghost hunters, most of whom are charlatans on late night cable access. Raxa\u2019s seen things, though, real things. As a result, she\u2019s become an ally to The Darkside Division helping with technical matters on a few cases.    \nThe Brightside Division \nMost things in Twin Lakes have a Darkside counterpart and our heroes are no exception. Chief Ghouley and Special Agent McScream have their fair share of run-ins with McQueen and Dooley, usually over jurisdictional affairs.\nTheir personalities are mirrors to that of McQueen and Dooley, with Ghouley being competent but cold and McScream being unhinged, howling at the moon and speaking in riddles.\nOthers\nTwin Lakes boasts a population of 75,666 residences (nobody is sure if the Darkside has census data). Season 1 introduced us to over 140 of them, but that still leaves a whole lot of new faces for us to meet!\nWe don\u2019t want to give too much away, but there are still all manner of wibblies to investigate in Twin Lakes. Some cases we\u2019ve subtly set up in season 1, while others have freshly baked in our brains!\nWithout discussing the mysteries themselves, season 2 will see the guys taking on a fun fair, a retirement home, an amateur wrestling circuit and their scariest case yet - their high-school reunion!\nThe Darkside Detective is developed by Spooky Doorway, an Irish studio made up of three devs who met on a cursed island off the Irish coast. They formed a pact to work together on something, but had no idea what. One game jam later (and with the help of several wonderful friends) The Darkside Detective was born.\nThose three devs were (and, barring some slight loss of self, continue to be):\nPaul Conway - Art - @DoomCube\n Dave McCabe - writing - @davetheallthing\n Treasa McCabe - Development - @FarrellyTracey\nNeed something to cover up that sentient patch of mould that whispers dark secrets and keeps you awake at night? Then this fancy-pants poster is for you! For added protection we\u2019ll sign the ancient sigils that make up our names on it, too.\nStick it on your laptop, your school books or that angry child who\u2019s always looking funny at you in the mall. However you do it, let the world know you\u2019re a fan of The Darkside Detective. How else will evil know to leave you alone?\nEver look at your t-shirts and think \u201cwhat is this cotton-polyester-blended muck?\u201d Well, you won\u2019t need them once you get this exclusive shirt. You\u2019ll be the talk of the town. Which town and why they are talking about you are questions best left unasked.\nTry decipher the devs\u2019 chicken scrawl and find out what\u2019s written on your card. Is it a joke? The meaning of life? Is it part of a larger riddle that will only get solved when all cards are gathered and aligned correctly? There\u2019s only one way to find out.\nHalf art book, half lore book, half activity book, the Almanac has it all \u2013 unseen case files, new lore about Twin Lakes and the Darkside, puzzles, the Bloodwolf charter, newspaper clippings, rituals, bios on citizens, criminals and beasties and more!\nYour face, in the style of the game's portraits, printed onto a poster with McQueen and Dooley \u2013 be the pixillated criminal your teachers always knew you could be!\n *Characters appearing in the game will have your appearance and name, but final say on their actions and dialogue sits with Spooky Doorway. We'll endevour to ensure you say or do nothing embarasing or offensive, but it will be in tone with other characters in the world.\nMilestone 1 - get the cash!\nMilestone 2 - make the game!\nMilestone 3 - deliver it!\nMilestone 4 - profit!  \n\u201cHold up, chums - why are there no dates on any of these milestones?\u201d  \nOoooh, you caught us! We know from making Season 1 and the additional cases that came afterwards that each case takes the time it takes. As the world gets bigger and cases get longer, we want to make sure that quality doesn\u2019t drop. That\u2019s not our style, daddios. To give us the room to do deliver that quality we foresee an 18 month dev cycle. As most things in The Darkside Detective are bespoke - the gags, locations, puzzles, music, etc - we can\u2019t break it down more than that (sometimes a case goes really smoothly, sometimes it needs a lot of iteration ), so instead of a timeline, have this nice cakechart (we don\u2019t like pie) of where the money is going:\n \u201cYeah guys, why the Kickstarter? You already made the first one, didn\u2019t that make you enough cash? Jeez!\u201d  \nGood question, fictional friend. Yes, the Darkside Detective Season 1 made us some cash, but a lot of that went into porting the game and making new content for it. More is being invested into further ports and localisation of season 1. And, as we made season 1 with no budget, we had some debts to clear. We do however have some money left over, which is going into Darkside season 2. But games aren\u2019t cheap to make and we need a little help to bulk out what we have. That\u2019s why we\u2019re only looking for \u20ac35k. Games costs a lot of money to make and businesses are expensive to run, after all!  \nAlso, this Kickstarter will give us an idea of how much interest there is in a season 2. We\u2019re old people and don\u2019t know how much time we have left. We want to make sure that if we sink it into a season 2, that people will want to play it. Otherwise we\u2019ll just go outside and play with our families and pets.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere\u2019s not that many, actually.

Play the Demo!\nEnjoy a sneak peek of life on the mean streets of Cradlebridge...\n___\nThree months ago, you died. And in that moment you were reborn as something new. A monster. A predator. Not a creature of the night, but one of its masters.\nUnfortunately, things aren't simple as they used to be. Vampires have finally been exposed, and though your existence is tolerated, your new nature is not. You came to the City hoping for a new start, but found only suspicion and starvation. Now you stare at the ceiling of your cheap hotel room as a penniless outcast, suckling on rats and destined to wither away.\nBut every new era brings new opportunities, and in the political chaos of a world gone mad, even an outcast may rise. An outcast can change everything.\nThis is the story of how you rose.\nLatest Updates\n#10 - Nighthawks Exposed - City of Colours\n#11 - Nighthawks Exposed - Second Death\n#12 - Nighthawks Exposed - Flashbacks\n#13 - One Week Remains - Stretch Goals, The Demo, Cats\nPress?

Check the bottom of the page for assets, including a YouTube version of the trailer to share, or e-mail contact@nighthawks-game.com.\nEmbrace the Night \nYour new life begins... on the wrong side of the tracks in a city that hates you.\nNighthawks is the brand new urban fantasy RPG from Wadjet Eye Games (The Blackwell Legacy, Unavowed, Technobabylon) and writer/designer Richard Cobbett (Sunless Sea/Sunless Skies, The Long Journey Home). The initial concept for the game came when working on Sunless Skies and dreaming of seeing that calibre of interactive fiction merged with the atmosphere of some of his favourite urban-fantasy books and games, in particular 2004's Vampire: The Masquerade: Bloodlines... and then deciding he wanted to play that new game far too much to just leave the idea sitting in the mental \"What If?\" folder.\nWhich brings us to now. Welcome to the mean streets of a city grudgingly trying to show that humans and vampires can live together, despite the cynicism and conspiracies raging on both sides. It's a place of bleak horror and dark humour, filled with monsters who don't all have fangs and a thirst for blood, and featuring new stories down every dark alley. What part will you play, and how will you turn a newly awakened world to your advantage?\nAbout The Game \nRun your own nightclub, as your personal sanctuary and a trap for unwary visitors.\nNighthawks is a mix of story-driven RPG and undead life-simulation, where every decision you make is another move in your chess game against the world. Invest your time into learning new skills or honing your fighting style as you uncover the city's mysteries and venture deep into its darkest secrets. Gather fellow outcasts to your side, binding them with favours and choosing when to cash in. Manage your eternal thirst, legitimately, or balancing the risks of being caught stalking unwary victims and working the black markets.\nAnd of course, what would a vampire be without a few secret powers? Choose from a range of dark Gifts, including Corpse-Talking, Tenebraean Form and Mesmerise. Be careful to hide all evidence of them from the authorites, while keeping them ready as your ace in the hole. Embrace your vampire side, sprinkle a little cinnamon in your blood to handle that pesky iron aftertaste, and get ready to live the nocturnal nine-to-five.\nStructurally, think a freeform RPG core, with stories branching off it - some funny, some tragic, some horrific - where your decisions are always bleeding together. Get caught lying too often and your untrustworthy reputation will follow you around, while raising suspicion will draw the attention of first mortal, and then darker authorities. Do you, for instance, break a window and hurriedly search a crime scene while the alarms wail, pick the lock and explore at your leisure, or use vampire powers to impersonate the security guard and walk right in? The choice is yours, and all part of learning the beat of the city, developing new skills, and building up favours and contacts to help seize the day by the throat.\nChoose Your Friends Carefully... \nKnowledge is power. Your bartender Rebecca hears everything that's going on in town.\nNever travel alone. Befriend and recruit a wide circle of fellow outcasts, such as Madame Lux, vampire stage magician capable of fooling any eye with delusions of light. Con-artist turned cult-leader Maze. Vampire enforcer Saiorse, as comfortable discussing great works of opera as she is getting her claws into the most dangerous dockland fighting pits. Former Queen of the Black Sea Inez, a ruthless pirate out of her time. Disgraced scientist Morgan Shah, funding her attempts to cure vampirism by selling crystal meth. Maybe even Samuel, a former doctor cursed with good intentions and a withered brain that considers no fate worse than death for patients who end up in his care. No matter how much they beg.\nCompanions here don't just fight for you. Take part in their lives as they work on their own problems, have them look into rumours with their own contacts and social circles and dive into their deepest secrets with interactive flashbacks set in locations like 17th century Nassau, Las Vegas, and the corrupt European courts of the Eternal Dynasties. Help them handle their demons, and they'll help you deal with yours. But good deeds rarely go unpunished, and everyone has their own agenda that consumes their endless nights.\nEnter The Story  \nWith every choice comes consequence. How will you live your second life?\nWhy are we focusing on text? The possibilities! Games like Sunless Sea and 80 Days and Cultist Simulator have repeatedly demonstrated this over the last few years, and we intend Nighthawks to be seen in that company - a deep, wide, replayable RPG in which a favour can be the ultimate weapon and the friendliest smiles often have the sharpest teeth.\nText-driven gameplay lets us really focus on details and mechanics, including bringing you a living city with little seen features like NPC scheduling (you might, for instance, know a guy who'll slip you blood from the hospital blood bank, but he only works Tuesdays to Fridays and it's Saturday), varied stories, incredibly reactive characters, and most importantly, player freedom. You're planning to head out on a quest you were expecting to pay for your hotel room this week, but the friend you wanted to bring along isn't available. Do you wait? Take someone else? Risk going alone? Hope for another opportunity?\nWe're drawing inspiration from a wide range of RPG classics, from Baldur's Gate 2 to Yakuza to Bloodlines to Fallout to Quest For Glory, and in particular, their sense of freedom and focus on letting you live in their worlds. In Nighthawks, you're in charge of your destiny, whether it's running your nightclub sanctuary, playing politics, or plunging into stories that range from light-hearted adventure and modern political intrigue to blisteringly bleak horror.\nMeet The Team \nJust a few of the games our team has worked on...\nAll that said, it's also going to look and sound great! Along with Richard Cobbett on words and design, we have Ben Chandler (Unavowed, Shardlight) and Ivan Ulyanov (The Charnel House Trilogy) on art, painting a 'living book' style that combines backgrounds and animated ambient effects in glorious 4K resolution.\nLast, but definitely not least, we have adventure game legend Dave Gilbert (The Shivah, The Blackwell Legacy, Unavowed) acting as executive producer and overseer of the whole project, cracking whips and ensuring things stay on track. Budget allowing, we also hope to bring in additional writers to help produce extra-varied stories and characters, as well as other experts to help polish everything up to a fine shine. On top of all that, we're bringing a full voice cast to breathe life into the characters, and of course, plenty of original music.\nThe Biz Side \nWe're looking at a development cycle of around 18 months, not including time already invested to get to this stage. We're not doing physical rewards like pins and posters, so as to be able to spend every dollar on creating the best RPG we can make. Instead, we're focusing on rewards that let backers at every level become immortalised within the game itself. Be the vampire you deserve to be... or the unwary blood-bag, or undead hunter, or crooked cop, or depraved sewer abomination. Are you ready to be killed by yourself?\nTarget Platforms and Beta Access \nA living city full of stories. Write yours.\nOur key platforms at the moment are PC and Mac. We also hope to bring Nighthawks to iOS at release, and will be looking at other platforms closer to the release date.\nAs for beta testing, we don't believe in offering it as a reward tier - you're helping us! - but there will be opportunities to sign up and take part in that during development.\nCommunity\nJoin the Discord!

We're a small team, aiming to bring you more design innovation with text, careful art and a tight budget than many AAA RPGs and developers with all their fancy polygons and resources.\n\nBut that's the fun part! And we can do it. We're all interactive fiction veterans with multiple titles to our name, using well-established tools like Ink and Unity to bring you a game we think will be both special, and the deep urban fantasy experience gamers have been dying for. The main risk is that development time is always hard to predict, save that everything always takes a bit longer than expected, and stretch goals especially always mean extra work to get things right. But we will.

However, the pieces are in place, and I think they're working pretty well.

Your deck is instead made for you based on your player state, companion, weapons (one melee, one ranged) and stats, and any injuries or similar you might already have sustained.

Keys will be given after the campaign, once the pledges have successfully been processed.\nHarem Route Successfully Unlocked!!\n  Love Esquire is a romantic-comedy visual novel/dating simulator, with a nostalgic touch of old-school RPG combat.\nIn this game, you're not a famous knight, but a good-for-nothing squire who's on a quest to find man's greatest pleasure. Getting the girl won't be easy though, since most of them are waaay out of your league!\nTo make things worse: you have a few months left before this huge war happens, and the only thing you know is how to milk cows. Good luck cramming years worth of training into four months! If it's any consolation, you get a medal if you die. \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af\nNo one believes that a lowly squire can save the world while banging \u2013 err, bagging \u2013 the girl of his dreams... but with a shitton of dumb luck, well... you might just prove them wrong!\nWelcome to the world of Love Esquire, and may the fertility god have mercy on your virginity.\nWhose name will these girls cry out during those scenes? You decide! This is your adventure, after all.\nOn an epic quest to experience man\u2019s greatest pleasure, you get to choose from five eligible ladies. Spend time with either the local farm girl, nurse, or perhaps that troublemaker from downtown. If you\u2019re feeling a bit ambitious, there\u2019s also two princesses for you to romance. Whoever you chose, these girls have their own personality quirks and unique storylines for you to discover. \nJust like in real life, you\u2019ll have to manage your time wisely in the game. Traveling, training, socializing, and searching for the girl of your dreams all take up a big chunk of your day, so plan ahead! The life of a squire may be a busy one, but that doesn\u2019t mean you should overwork! Be careful, or else you\u2019ll wake up late the next day...\nNow that your days as a farm boy are over, you get another dirty job \u2014 being a squire! But to reach some level of decency, 'Squirehood for Dummies' suggests you train these abilities (stats):\nCharisma (CHA) - a squire should always capture everyone\u2019s hearts.\nIntelligence (INT) - a squire should always know how to keep his knight alive.\nStrength (STR) - a squire should always be in top shape.\nThese stats will have an impact on your skills during combat. In addition, they also affect your relationship with the girls (each have their own preference), and influences the ending you'll get. In other words, shape up to be the ideal man for the best results!\nStats can be trained at the Barracks (STR), Tavern (CHA), and Archives (INT). Of course, the more time you spend training, the higher the resulting experience.\nWe\u2019ve added our own flavor to the classic RPG turn-based combat system! Put your skills to the test and prove your worth by battling powerful monsters during campaigns! \nPlease wait for the image to load.\nAs a squire, you have a number of \u201cunconventional\u201d ways to assist your needy knight by healing him, boosting his morale, taunting enemies, and looting gold. Properly time your actions to unleash the full potential of your skills which are simply... out of this world!\nGet to know your waifu on a personal level by being around her and talking about stuff. Sure, she\u2019ll think you\u2019re a creep at first, but persistence is key! As she eventually warms up to you, find out how there\u2019s more to her than meets the eye.  \nGiving gifts can also boost your relationship. After all, who doesn't love a man that knows how to treat his lady right? Just remember that not everyone will like the same gift, so don\u2019t give your girl the wrong items!\nYour fate is determined by the actions you take. As such, things can either go really great... or really wrong. \nWhat's waiting for your squire at the end of four months? We hope you make the right choices to get that sweet and happy ending you deserve. If not, well... let\u2019s just see what happens!\nSo that your waifus can partially express their partially undying love for you, we've teamed up with voice over veterans at Sound Cadence Studios to bring our characters to life through partial voice acting!  \nWith their help, Love Esquire boasts a professional and equally stellar cast spearheaded by VO director, Amber Lee Connors:\nThe game contains subjects and themes your parents warned you about as a kid.\nFurthermore, even though the game features a healthy amount of fanservice, ecchi and sexually suggestive illustrations, no private parts will be shown. The game will also not have an official 18+ or h-patch due to our country's legal laws. \nHowever, since parts of the game will be moddable on release, fan-made patches are possible in the future.\nLove Esquire will support simple modding. Specific parts of the game can be altered by the players, such as:\nScripts\nCGs\nBGMs & SFX\nFurther details regarding modding will be discussed in a future update. NOTE: Modding is not yet available in the alpha demo.\nThe game houses several backgrounds and CGs, all beautifully painted to give the game a polished and radiant look. Intimately explore not only the fantasy world of Caerulia, but your waifus as well. ;)\nWe want you to experience the feels while playing this game, and our soundtrack will see to that! Love Esquire has over 30 original tracks in total, with event and character themes for Squire and the five heroines. Why don't you give it a listen?\nHaving lived most of his life as a farm boy, you take control of the inexperienced and carefree Squire. Watch him grow to become the ideal man and overcome the various challenges he's yet to face.  \nHis fate (and virginity) rests in your hands.\nThese are the lovely ladies of Love Esquire. More than just pretty faces, they have their own unique personalities, story arcs, and backstories!\nFor better or for worse, these plot-important minor characters are here to see you through your journey.\nDepending on how smooth the development goes, we're looking at a late-2018 to mid-2019 release for Love Esquire. It will be distributed on Steam and Itch.io (Windows/Mac/Linux), followed by a mobile release (Android/iOS) a few months after. We don't have any plans for a console release, but that's something we might possibly consider once the game is out.\nWe've been self-funding Love Esquire's development for a year now, along with some help from our generous Patrons. But with sales from our previous game thinning down, we need additional funding to help us survive the final stretch of production. Furthermore, we want to include several features that are, unfortunately, way out of our budget. We're hoping to gather as much support as we can to realize our dreams for the game (see stretch goals). \nKickstarter is also a good way to establish rapport and communication with our players as development goes on. We highly encourage you to be involved whenever we have an update. Your feedback is essential to ensure that Love Esquire will stay on the right track!\nTo ensure your money is handled properly, here's a breakdown on how we plan to use the funds:\nArt & Animation (40%) - we want our art assets to be beautiful and polished down to the last detail, so a huge chunk of our funding will go to this department.\nWriting & Editing (20%) - while the story in Love Esquire is relatively shorter compared to an average visual novel, we still need to ensure that it has a good flow and will have the proper editing that it needs.\nProgramming (20%) - the game is being developed in Unity 3D, and we still have a couple of systems that need to be thoroughly tested. Our programmers are working hard to ensure that the game is stable with minimal bugs upon release.\nMusic (10%) - As previously mentioned, Love Esquire will have its own original soundtrack, and at least 10 more BGMs are awaiting to be composed.\nFees & Taxes (10%) - last but not the least, we need to pay the required fees and taxes to Kickstarter and the government.\nIn exchange for your kind patronage, you get these cool and awesome rewards! Thank you so much for supporting Love Esquire! \nHere are our ambitious stretch goals for the game. These goals will surely bring out the best in Love Esquire in terms of gameplay, story and overall polish. \nBecause of their scope, all of them require substantial dev time to implement, so the game's schedule will have to be adjusted accordingly. Further details will be discussed in a future update.\nThis is the bare minimum we need to ensure that we wouldn't have a very hard time finishing the game (financially, at least). This includes all the features already mentioned above.\nThis level of support will give us enough funding to implement animated backgrounds into the game. While we don't have any samples yet to show for Love Esquire, the image above shows how we handled background animations in our previous game, The Letter. \nReaching this goal will allow us to put at least ten more juicy CGs into the game! That's a loooot more plots and backstories for you! ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0)\nDesigns are work-in-progress, and may change in the final version.\nOur digital dakimakuras will come to fruition! We will be able to print them in the highest quality possible (2way tricot) for your hugging comfort! They will be available as an add-on through BackerKit once the campaign ends. \nNOTE: This is a pillow case only. Actual pillow is not included. \nThis guarantees that the game will be fully voiced in English, even the faceless NPCs! Because of your support, we can now afford to compensate our stellar cast for the heavy workload!\nAll CGs in the game will be animated using Spine2D for a more dramatic effect. The animation quality will be similar to the game's main menu (see video above). \nBoob physics, here we come!\nIf you allow us to go this far, we will be able to expand, upgrade and further polish our RPG campaign by refining the gameplay and adding more enemies & levels into the game! \nSample study only. Not final.\nBut wait! There's more! You will be able to bring your waifu into your adventures! Amy as your bard, or Princess Kamala as the team's mage? What could possibly go wrong!\nWe will produce a fully animated, frame-by-frame one-minute opening trailer for the game, which rivals what we did for The Letter's (see video above). The full song used in the trailer will be included in the game's original soundtrack DLC.\nWe're Yangyang Mobile, an indie company specializing in video games and mobile apps development. Our HQ in the Philippines is run by a group of passionate individuals who live off creativity and pizza! We're known for The Letter and The Diary, both interactive visual novel games.\nThe Letter was a successful Kickstarter project and a highly-rated game; it is our validation to everyone that we're not only capable of completing this project, but also delivering it up to standards. \nWith your help, we're hoping Love Esquire to become our best game yet! :)\nEven if you can't pledge to our campaign, you could contribute by helping us spread the word! It's very important for more people to know about our game. You could make fanarts or do let's plays, or tell your favorite Youtuber/Twitch Streamer/Press/Media about us! \nClick the image to download!\nYou could also show your support by using these Love Esquire avatars, and by helping achieve our social media challenge (see harem challenge above), so the game could have an official harem route!\nThe success of Love Esquire is all up to you!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAlthough there\u2019s always a chance that the game\u2019s release might be delayed, the completion of Love Esquire is extremely likely at this point, since we\u2019re already half-way through the game\u2019s development (unless the apocalypse happens). \n\nWhile we cannot promise a smooth sailing development period moving forward, what we can promise is that we\u2019ll be as transparent as possible regarding the setbacks that we\u2019re facing, and what our plans of actions are towards resolving them.\n\nWe\u2019re not new to game development, and this isn\u2019t our first title, so we\u2019re more than ready and equipped to overcome the various challenges we\u2019ve yet to face. We hope we\u2019ve garnered enough credibility, trust, and goodwill in the past to prove to everyone that we always keep our promises to the best of our abilities.\n\nThank you so much for considering to back Love Esquire, and we hope you join us in our ride! \u2661\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge HK$ 10 or more", "title": "\u272a SUPPORTER \u272a", "descp": "[About $1 USD]\nGain access to our Kickstarter updates and BackerKit, in case you want to upgrade your pledge later on.

Although we'll continue using your money to improve the game's polish and quality, we don't feel comfortable promising any further features or additional content. So... thank you for making our dream come true! Now it's our turn to repay the favor.\n Boyfriend Dungeon is an action-RPG dungeon crawler in which the weapons you use transform into beautiful people -- take them on dates to level them up and become more powerful together.\nDate up to nine weapons, from dancing swords to heart-piercing daggers\nGenerated action-combat dunj and challenges! Stay sharp!\nVarious combat styles. For example, hit hard and dodge quickly with the dagger, or take on crowds with Lasersaber\nInclusive, tasteful approach to gender and sexuality, including male, female, and non-binary romance\nLet's get to the point: take your weapon-babes on romantic outings, such as to the club or the beach\nThe couple that slays together, stays together.\n This campaign not only supports us making our dream game, but also offers you once-in-a-lifetime merchandise, including weapon-dating-based mugs, body pillowcases, pins, and other extremely practical objects.\nAwards: Boyfriend Dungeon has already won two awards at BitSummit, and has been selected for showcases, including the PAX West Indie Megabooth and the Damage Camp Arcade 2018.  \nPlatforms: Boyfriend Dungeon is developed by us, Kitfox Games, and we already have permission to create the game on Steam for PC, Mac, and Linux! Check out our Steam coming soon page and after you back us, feel free to add us to your wishlist\u2026\nWe will also offer DRM-free versions of PC, Mac, and Linux via the Humble Store.\nWhat about consoles? Or other stores? We\u2019re not ready to talk about consoles yet, sorry! This campaign is specifically to support us being able to make the best possible desktop version and merchandise.\nKitfox Games is an award-winning game studio. Boyfriend Dungeon is the fourth title we're bringing to Steam. For more information about our past games, scroll down to the section below entitled The Team.\nAs of the start of this campaign, we've now revealed all 5 of the weapons you can date (Talwar, Dagger, Epee, Lasersaber, and Glaive).\nThis campaign, in addition to helping us finish the game, will fund a 6th weapon... the cat, Brass Knuckles!\nWe don\u2019t want to give away too many spoilers, so we won\u2019t tell you everything about the weapons, but we\u2019ve prepared these dating profiles so you can get an idea of who you might prefer! If you're more interested in their combat abilities and play-styles, scroll down to see their individual tactics.\nAlternately, you can take our Wielder Test to see which one we would recommend for you.\nThe talwar is a type of curved sword or sabre from the Indian Subcontinent. (Wikipedia)\nSunder says: \"Hey, gorgeous. I didn't expect to meet someone like you in the dunj... I hope I can keep you safe. I've been around a while but don't believe everything you hear -- some people are jealous, or don't know how to forgive. But you're the open-minded type, right?\"\nDaggers have been used throughout human experience for close combat confrontations... (Wikipedia)\nValeria says: \"Oh, hey, you're cute! So.. what's your deal? You can tell me. If you want to, I mean. What? Oh, don't worry about him. He's just an old friend, looking out for me. Let's talk about you instead. Maybe you should come by my studio sometime and I'll paint you..\"\nThe entire body is the valid target area. A successful \u00e9p\u00e9e fencer must be able to anticipate their opponent's moves and strike their opponent at the correct time. (Wikipedia)\nIsaac says: \"Goodness. Let's get down to facts, shall we? I may be new to the dunj, but I know plenty about fencing. Hold onto me tightly, but not too tight. Deep breaths. Parry, then thrust. Practice makes perfect.\"\nWhen a Lasersaber powers up, he can be dangerous, but most of the time, he prefers to recharge his batteries.\nSeven says: \"Hey. I want to keep our.. friendship.. secret for now, if that's okay with you. My agent and fans are a little high-maintenance and I just want to relax. Maybe we can watch TV together sometime?\"\nThis class of polearms [is rated] above all other individual hand-to-hand combat weapons. (Wikipedia)\nSawyer says: \"UHH! I'm late for class, but.. hi! Um. Since you seem to have your life together, maybe you can show me how to cook? Would that be okay? I wouldn't want to waste your time. Let me know, but no worries if you're too busy.\"\nAnd this Kickstarter, if it succeeds, will help fund a sixth weapon, Brass Knuckles! \nBrass knuckles are designed to preserve and concentrate a punch's force... (Wikipedia)\nPocket says: \"Meow! Mew meow meow. PRR!\" Then he curled up in a ball and fell asleep. When we tried to reach him for further comment, he growled and hissed at us! It seems he's not a lapcat by nature.. and certainly not a romantic partner. Platonic love can be fulfilling, too!\nRowan says: \"Hi? This is sudden for me. I'm going to need some time. I'm - never mind. I don't want to bother you. I'll call you, but... please be patient.\" \nThrough your support, we've funded Rowan the Scythe, our second dateable non-binary weapon! They're being designed by Hato Moa, creator of Hatoful Boyfriend.\nLeah says: \u201cHey, cutie. Thanks for including me. I usually like to train alone, but maybe we can try the dunj as a team sport. It\u2019ll be an adventure. Just promise you\u2019ll try your best\u2026 and play fair.\u201d\nYou've manged to fund Leah the Hammer as another stretch goal, our second dateable female weapon!\nAxe says: \"It's a beautiful day, so... what do you say we leave these computers behind and just go hang out on the beach? Feel free to come surf with me, but... I might not talk much. I hope that's okay. I'd still like your company.\"  \nYou funded the Axe! His name will be voted on in our exclusive Discord server (any reward tier at VIP/$35 or above). Invites will be sent out for it soon after the Kickstarter ends, so hold on tight!\nYou\u2019re free to date only one weapon if you are the monoblade-ous type of person, but nobody minds if you favor grabbing multiple hilts. As you level up your love with them, each Love Rank lets you proceed further with that character\u2019s plot line(s), and also offers combat bonuses.\nYou\u2019ve been unlucky in love, but you came to Verona Beach to learn from your Cousin Jesse, who\u2019s promised to help you out. Who are you exactly? You choose! You can customize your character, and choose from him, her, or them as pronouns. This doesn\u2019t affect who you can date or what options you have.\nFair Verona Beach, where we lay our scene, is in many ways a typical southern California town. The weather\u2019s great, the surf is high, and the slang 'dunj' is dangerous. In this gig economy, some people turn to killing monsters for a quick buck\u2026 while others discover they can transform into weapons.  \nVerona Beach is populated by various other people (baristas, security guards, shop keepers, etc). They\u2019re mostly pretty nice, and some of them even care about you!  \nBut something darker lurks in Verona Beach\u2026\nUnfortunately, kissing can\u2019t solve all of your problems. Sometimes, you need a sword. Wait, stop kissing the sword. Wield it instead!\nThese days, kids get money and meet people by killing monsters in the dunj, making the world a safer place in the process. Be brave -- local authorities are willing to give you basic medical attention afterwards. Clearing local infestations is a group effort!    \nThe first dunj is the Verona Beach Center, a mall overrun by creatures most hideous. We have two more dunjs in progress, the Nightclub and something secret! Each dunj features different monster types, challenges, music, potential romantic spots to find, and secrets to discover.    \nBoss monsters may also interrupt your dunj flow, so train up and make sure you and your weapon are both ready for a tough fight!  \nBoss concepts\nSometimes there are enemies that swarm; sometimes you need to focus your attacks; sometimes you need to move around to avoid an onslaught! Some weapons will be better-suited to some dunjs and enemy encounters than others.  \nIt\u2019s up to you to find the best tactics in each situation\u2026 or you could just get more experience and level up until you one-shot them, if you prefer. A general idea of how each weapon plays: \nLeft: Talwar | Right: Dagger\nTalwar attacks and combos tend to cover a wider area, while Dagger attacks and combos tend to be quick and focus on a narrower area. \nLeft: Epee | Right: Lasersaber\nEpee attacks and combos tend to require precision but have the capability to stun, while Lasersaber attacks and combos can be upgraded to reflect projectiles and do ranged attacks! \nAll of these (plus the development of Glaive and Brass Knuckles) are likely to evolve as we continue to work on the game. We\u2019ve made good progress, but our Kickstarter backers will help us nail down many of the details in the coming months. \nWhat if it\u2019s too easy or too hard? We\u2019ll have difficulty modes, but we\u2019d also like to offer special challenges and opt-in modifiers for folks that want to, for example, make enemies have more health, or want to fight optional bosses, in exchange for more loot. This means the game will be complete-able at a basic level even by folks who normally stick to dating sims, while also offering some \"fun\" to those poor masochists who have been damaged by Dark Souls (you know who you are). \nA good relationship with your weapon starts with a romantic date. Luckily for you, Verona Beach is filled with dreamy date spots like the local museum, sunny beach, or flashy nightclub. Make the right choices and you might find your weapons warming up to you!\nAs you date each weapon, you\u2019ll learn more about them and earn their trust, making you a more effective team in combat. \nBut, in this game as in real life, every relationship is a little bit different in its benefits and demands. Some partners will teach you how to do more damage, while others will help you use skills more effectively.\nEven when you're busy slaying monsters, the dunj will feature spots for some mini-dates, because love knows no bounds. Above all, you'll be able to cultivate meaningful relationships full of supportive and inviting weapon babes... it just might take a bit of charm to get them out of their sheathes. \nYou\u2019re probably wondering what you\u2019re going to get from backing! Well, I mean, other than the eternal love and gratitude of the Kitfox team, of course.\nReceive a dev-signed postcard from Verona Beach! Available in the Long Distance Relationship tier and above.\nThe Kickstarter-exclusive enamel pin, available in the Bae Box Set tier and above.\nThe Bae Box Set includes an elegant rose USB key, in which to hide your heart's secrets.\n  Everything in the Bae Box tier.

They're an illustrator from Toronto, currently working as a Jr. Art Director for mobile games in the San Francisco Bay Area. Their past work includes animations and illustrations for Titmouse, Studio Yotta, Konami and Penguin Random House. Jessica would transform into a Shield in the dunj.\nAnimation: Sunder Raj from Particle Beam made the beautiful animation of Talwar's transformation! We'd love to hire Particle Beam to make transformation sequences for the rest of the weapons, but we'll see what we can afford... Sunder from Particle Beam would transform into a Durian in the dunj.\nJapanese Localization & Publishing: We loved working with Kakehashi Games to bring the best version of Moon Hunters and The Shrouded Isle to Japan, so we'll be working with them again for Boyfriend Dungeon. The lead of Kakehashi, Zach, would transform into a Kusarigama in the dunj.\nMerch Design & Manufacturing: We were really impressed by the Moon Hunters indiebox, so we decided to work with them to create the Boyfriend Dungeon merch, which resulted in the luscious tiers of rewards here. If you're looking to make money from shirts & pins, we recommend Indiebox, so hit up James at ConferenceMerch.com (tell him Tanya sent ya)! The lead of Indiebox, James, would transform into Nunchucks in the dunj.\nHey, we're Kitfox Games! We're an independent Montreal-based games studio with a soft spot for exploring and discovering new, dangerous worlds. Previously, we made Shattered Planet, Moon Hunters, The Shrouded Isle, and in addition to making Boyfriend Dungeon we're publishing Six Ages.\nThe Boyfriend Dungeon team\nTanya X. Short (@tanyaxshort): Captain, Lead Designer. Led Kitfox in creating Moon Hunters and Shattered Planet, and wrote for and published The Shrouded Isle. Previously was a senior designer on The Secret World and Age of Conan. Tanya has never said she didn't date a weapon, so you could probably say this game is based on a true story. Nobody can prove otherwise. Tanya would transform into a Sabre in the dunj.\nXin Ran Liu (@xinranliu): Art Director. Previously art directed Moon Hunters and Shattered Planet, and illustrated tons of different things, from book covers to band posters to game concept art. Xin would transform into a Chakram in the dunj.  \nMarcelo Perez (@scientistsloth): Lead Programmer. Marcelo (almost) single-handedly coded the Moon Hunters cooking system and also ported Moon Hunters to all the consoles! Now that he\u2019s almost recovered from such a feat, he\u2019s making sure Boyfriend Dungeon is better-structured for porting. Marcelo would transform into a Meteor Hammer in the dunj.\nKira Boom (@snowkittykira): Dungeon Programmer. Kira was the primary combat programmer for Moon Hunters, and previously did lots of programming on FRACT OSC. She\u2019s also part of Mindfungus, which released the adorable Cityglitch! Kira is a wielder, not a weapon.\nVictoria Tran (@thevtran): Community Manager & Public Relations. Victoria has been managing the Kitfox events, community, press, and social media for over a year now, so if you\u2019ve fallen in love with silly Boyfriend Dungeon gifs, that\u2019s her genius. Victoria would transform into a Bread Knife in the dunj.  \nHey, I Remember Moon Hunters!\nThank you to everyone who backed our first Kickstarter in 2014! Because of their help, and other funding sources, we were able to create our first big game, Moon Hunters! Moon Hunters sold decently well and won some awards, so, it\u2019s hard to complain. Plus we released it with only a few months of delay -- not bad.\nWe learned a few lessons along the way, which we\u2019re applying to Boyfriend Dungeon, like to carefully structure support for potential future DLC. There was also Shattered Planet and the Shrouded Isle, but we didn\u2019t Kickstart them. I hope you still bought them. We sure learned a lot from those, too.\nThere are also a few Kitfoxes working on a different game (you might wonder where Jongwoo went, for example), but they are using a different source of funding, and none of the Kickstarter money will go to them. Speaking of which... \nWithout your help, we don't know when Boyfriend Dungeon will happen or when we can finish the game as it demands. Plus, with this campaign, we can add the cat as a weapon and make all of the dates, dungeons, and everything in between as polished, beautiful, and amazing as they can be. \nWe loved the input we got from Moon Hunters backers, but we felt like we didn't use it enough because we weren't ready for all of your ideas! So we want your feedback to help us shape the game in the years to come.\nWe\u2019re going to be especially interested in feedback on:  \nBalancing and pacing  \nCharacter story arcs & tone/content \nNew item/equipment ideas\nAlthough early beta-testers (from CAD$35+) will have the opportunity to give the most hands-on feedback experience with us, we will post regular updates to Kickstarter, and all backers\u2019 comments will be welcomed and shared among the team.  \nPLUS we wanted to make some unique limited-edition merch and pre-ordering those mugs and t-shirts and pillow cases makes it easier for us to see how many to make. :)  \nPlease back us so that we can get your input, and also deliver sweet merch to sweet people.\nWe\u2019ve already been working on Boyfriend Dungeon for over a year! But this Kickstarter helps us understand how many fans are out there, and how much we can afford to keep pouring our hearts (and wallets) into it.  \nThis is roughly how we will split up the funds:\nAnd, with your help, we not only reached our goal... we reached all of our stretch goals! So we decided to stop scoping up, past $200k, and make the game the best it can be, with the features and content we are already planning. Thank you so much for believing in us!\nOur current language support plans include only English, French, and Japanese, due to the amount of words. We may consider others, depending on community involvement.\nAs for the development schedule, we\u2019re currently in the midst of production that we hope will finish next year, but we will work with Indiebox to mail your physical rewards as soon as we can, even before the game releases.\nThanks for all of your excitement, enthusiasm, and support. If you can't afford to buy the game, we understand.. but please tell any friends or acquaintances you might have that CAN -- every dollar and/or wishlist helps.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nKitfox Games is an award-winning studio that has released multiple games, including successfully releasing a Kickstarted game previously (Moon Hunters).

If we reach this goal, we will make sure there is a version of the game with all the potential ass, penis, boobs and vagina available. We're not sure what the Steam nudity policy will be like when we launch but we'll make sure we figure something out. (I really want to pay more artists to draw these beautiful gents and ladies naked.) \nBONUS: We'll make a NSFW version of the art book available to anyone who backs at $30+  \n$25k - Twelve characters plus all the supporting cast calls for a ton of different voices but we would love to get as much VO as possible in there to really bring the characters to life.  \n$30k - We will work on adding at least two more characters to the game. Probably to be released as DLC (for time reasons) but all backers will get these characters FOR FREE.

Now, bound inextricably to a geist \u2014 a shade, a monster, a tragic, broken soul \u2014 you stand between the world of the living and the world of the dead. You stand between the dead and the hungry dark that would devour them. You give a voice to the voiceless and tear down cosmic systems of oppression. You will make a better world, and if you die trying... well, you came back once, and you can do it again.\nIn Geist: The Sin-Eaters, you play a person who died with a powerful burden on their soul \u2014 something they didn't accomplish in life, or something they never found. On the other side of the veil, they made a bargain with a powerful being called a geist, which returned them to the world of the living and to their own body, at the cost of a permanent bond between them and the geist. Now your character stands as a medium, with one foot in the world of the living and one in the world of the dead. Will you bend your efforts toward the cosmic injustice of the Underworld, that consumes all who become trapped in its inky depths? Will you turn your wrath on the necromancers, the ghost-eaters, the two-bit frauds who exploit dead and living alike for their own enrichment? Will you reach out to the strange shade bound to you, to try to find the person beneath the inchoate fury and bring them peace? Will you bring a new faith to the masses and teach the living to welcome the dead into their lives? Or will you use all your newfound supernatural might to accomplish what you could not in life?  \nOriginally released in 2009, Geist: The Sin-Eaters was a sleeper hit for the Chronicles of Darkness, finally bringing \u201clife\u201d to the realm of ghosts and death. And now this game of second chances gets a second edition, with Geist: The Sin-Eaters 2nd Edition, offering a revised and updated rules system and an expanded setting.\nThis Geist: The Sin-Eaters 2nd Edition Kickstarter is designed to enable us to create a prestige hardcover edition designed to match the look and feel of our other Chronicles of Darkness core rulebooks such as Vampire: The Requiem, Werewolf: The Forsaken, or Mage: The Awakening...\nWe want to create an 8.5\" x 11\" hardcover with a beautifully designed, symbolic cover image printed on a metallic under layer, and featuring an emboss/deboss of the logo. We estimate the book to be more than 280+ pages, with a two-color interior and endpapers on high quality paper stock.\nGeist: The Sin-Eaters 2nd Edition includes all the rules you need to play as one of the Bound: Five Burdens reflecting the cause that pulled you back from the grave, five krewe Archetypes for building your own mystery religion, and the Haunts, Keys, and Ceremonies that provide the Bound with their macabre powers.\nIt also includes the Chronicle of the Dead, featuring the Sin-Eaters\u2019 struggle against the all-consuming Underworld and a variety of terrifying threats. In addition, for the first time in the Chronicles of Darkness line, ghosts are presented as playable characters.\nChapters include:\nThe Quick and the Dead: the five Burdens (the reason a Sin-Eater comes back from the dead and what draws a particular geist to them) and krewe Archetypes (the common cause that draws a krewe of Sin-Eaters together). \nThe Road Back: On death and coming back, and why Bound make the Bargain, including possible consequences. \nOne Foot in the Grave: Character creation, with sections on both geist and krewe creation, Anchors, Merits, Synergy, Plasm, Abilities, Haunts, Keys, Ceremonies, and Mementos. \nOld Laws: the core Chronicles of Darkness rules, with special rules for playing Sin-Eaters, as well as information on subsystems for krewes, ghosts, and the Underworld, including Avernian Gates. \nAntagonists: villains for your Geist chronicle, including Reapers, Eaters of the Dead, necromancers, enemy Bound, and Kerberoi. \nThe Quiet Places: Setting information and story hooks for playing your Geist chronicle in specific times and places in history., from 16th-century Brazil to modern-day Edinburgh, Scotland to Mobile, Alabama in 1910, as well as information on Dominions. \nGhost Stories: Storyteller advice and information for running a Geist chronicle, including designing Remembrances, how to set theme and mood, story seeds, and various ways to play out the end of a game. \nAppendix: The Absent: This Appendix details the Absent, playable ghosts, including Memories, new Merits, and a collection of possible ghost characters to expand on and use in your chronicle. \nAppendix: Conditions and Tilts: Geist-specific Conditions and Tilts, including ephemeral Influence Conditions and Manifestation Conditions for ghosts, as well as Haunt Conditions and Tilts.\nThroughout this Kickstarter campaign, we will be posting complete previews of the Geist: The Sin-Eaters 2nd Edition manuscript as backer-only updates.\nThe primary goal of this Kickstarter campaign is to create the best version of Geist: The Sin-Eaters 2nd Edition that is possible. Your support allows us to fund the best production, use the most appropriate components, and possibly even contract more art for the core book. We hope to not only deliver a beautiful hardcover book to all of our backers, but also fund at least one print run to be sold through distribution and into book and hobby stores that are so vital to our community.\nBeyond that primary goal, we hope to gain additional funding to explore more of the world of Geist, expanding into rules companions and other Storyteller and player tools and accessories. The greater our funding for this project, the more resources we are able to explore this (Under)world.\nThirdly, we want to celebrate the quiet legacy of Geist: The Sin-Eaters by offering an affordable bundle of first edition PDF titles. The Underworld Reflections bundle is a quick-and-easy way to dive into the world of Geist and revisit those ideas and concepts as we move forward with our new edition.\nBeyond all of those campaign-specific goals, we hope to do what our games have always done \u2014 open a path to a new world; a setting for our community to build new stories and entwine imaginations. Every person who participates in this campaign is joining with the goal of giving this game physical form \u2014 and like our protagonists, we all become Bound with common purpose. When you back this project, you join our krewe and we journey into the new edition together.\nAll participants who would like to make this project happen can pledge their support and add to the overall campaign total. If the campaign meets the funding target ($50,000), then we will have funded the project and it will become a reality. Your pledge will only be collected if we achieve our funding target.\nIn thanks for your support, we offer rewards based on your level of funding pledged. The Reward Tiers down the right side of the page outline the various rewards reflecting various levels of support pledged. Please note that rewards may automatically add additional charges to cover shipping expenses.\nClick to see a larger version of this chart\nTo help simplify matters, the basic reward chart lists the core reward and then combinations with each of the additional rewards offered as part of this campaign (see Reward Descriptions, below).\nKey Decision: do you stay non-corporeal with the digital PDF version only, or bind yourself to the physical world with the Hardcover + PDF reward? Please note that physical rewards may automatically add additional charges to cover shipping expenses.\nBackers looking to receive multiple copies should also note the Doppelg\u00e4nger and Krewe Reward Tiers, which offer 2 or 5 copies respectively as part of the rewards (and may save on shipping per unit!)\nFinally, we love retailers, but modern publishing methods don\u2019t always make it easy for them to get books into their stores. With this Geist: The Sin-Eaters 2nd Edition campaign, we have created a special Reward Tier just for you. Any retailer who pledges at the Retailer Reward Tier level (\"Spectre\") will get 5 copies of the hardcover book, PDF, and Storyteller's Screen at a retail-specific discount so that they can sell in-store.\nACCESS TO MANUSCRIPT PREVIEW UPDATES \u2013 During the course of the campaign, we will be posting the ENTIRE manuscript for Geist: The Sin-Eaters 2nd Edition. These previews will be shared via Backer-Only updates once per week. You must be a backer of this project to receive these updates.\nUNDERWORLD REFLECTIONS (1E PDF BUNDLE) - A bundle of relevant PDFs from the first edition of Geist: The Sin-Eaters, the Underworld Reflections bundle can provide inspiration and ideas for your Geist game.

The Memento Mori PDF will be added to the rewards list of all backers currently set to receive a PDF version of Geist: The Sin-Eaters 2nd Edition as part of their rewards. Currently, Memento Mori includes sections on the following topics:\nMementos\nKrewe Regalia & Ceremonies\nDominions\nHaunts\nHaunted Locations & Story Hooks\n\nREADY-MADE CHARACTERS - Pre-generated player characters designed for instant use in your Geist: the Sin-Eaters 2nd Edition game.

For Geist: The Sin-Eaters 2nd Edition, you will have the option of using DriveThruRPG\u2019s Print-On-Demand service to purchase a physical, printed copy directly from their PoD partners at as close as we can get to the cost of printing and shipping (this cost is not included in your pledge, and you do not need to increase the cost of your pledge to use this option). When the PoD versions are available to order (which will be some time after the hardcover has gone to print), you will receive links to purchase these versions of the book from DriveThruRPG.com. You DO NOT need to take advantage of this PoD offer as it does not affect in any way your pledge rewards.\nIn addition to the rewards listed in each reward tier, backers can increase their overall pledge to add on the following additional rewards. Simply increase your total pledge amount by the value indicated \u2013 we will confirm which add on rewards you\u2019ve chosen via BackerKit surveys after the campaign has run.\nAs we increase the overall funding and support for the project, we\u2019re able to add additional resources to the project, expand the rewards listed, and add in new offers and opportunities. Each Stretch Goal will have a target that, once reached, will release a reward from the Underworld. We will continue to build on this list when we achieve these targets during the campaign. Whenever we achieve a stretch goal, the image will be updated to reflect the achievement.\nAt $117,000 in funding - Memento Mori: Translation Guide \u2013 A section discussing how to update your 1st Edition characters to the 2nd Edition rules will be written for Memento Mori, the Geist: The Sin-Eaters 2nd Edition Companion.\n At $123,000 in funding - Memento Mori: Chapter Fiction \u2013 New frightening prose will be written for each section of Memento Mori, the Geist: The Sin-Eaters 2nd Edition Companion.\n At $129,000 in funding - Memento Mori: Sample Krewes \u2013 A section on sample krewes will be written for Memento Mori, the Geist: The Sin-Eaters 2nd Edition Companion\nThis is Onyx Path Publishing's 30th Kickstarter, and the company has learned how to maintain focus during a campaign to maintain manageable projects and achievable goals. To read more about the knowledge that has been applied to this project, you can read the FAQ linked here: http://theonyxpath.com/about/faq/kickstarter/", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRisk: This game isn't created at all even though the goal is reached.\n\nSolution: We have successfully shipped many Kickstarter projects and more are headed to completion as you read this. All those projects have taught us how the various pieces of the process works, and we have increased our ability to judge the various stages of delivery better with each KS. The text for Geist: The Sin-Eaters 2nd Edition is finished, initial interior artwork has been contracted, so the development process is well underway.\n\nRisk: Shipping costs soak up pledges that were meant to enable the creation of the book.\n\nSolution: Kickstarter shipping costs have continued to rise this last year, but we are aware of that and were able to find ways to work with shippers to bring down those costs - unfortunately, only to some extent as we have also needed to up the shipping charges- both methods allowing us to be sure that shipping doesn't eat up the pledge money supposed to go to printing.\n\nRisk: The game will take a long time to produce and anger the backers.\n\nSolution: We've learned many, many lessons with our previous Kickstarters and we're becoming much better at estimating the various pitfalls that will delay a KS project. We were able to deliver the PDFs for our last several KS projects several months before the estimate, and our last ship-out, for Pugmire, started a month earlier than estimated.\n\nThat being said, backers need to be aware that they are enabling a process, and not a pre-order opportunity, and things do sometimes run slower than we want or anticipate with that process. We've found that an open flow of communication between us and the backer community is vital so once the project funds we will deliver Updates on progress once a month (or more, as needed) via Kickstarter as well as in our regular, weekly, Monday Meeting Notes blog at www.theonyxpath.com\n\nADDITIONAL TERMS & CONDITIONS\n\nBy backing this Kickstarter project, you have agreed to the following additional terms and conditions:\n\nARTWORK, DESIGN, MATERIAL & CONTENTS SUBJECT TO CHANGE. Onyx Path shares artwork, design, descriptions and manuscript contents with the understanding that changes may occur in the creation of the final product based on further development, available resources and materials, and the nature of the creative process.\n\nREWARDS REQUIRING ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REQUIRE TIMELY RESPONSE. Some rewards, particularly limited Special Rewards such as art model descriptions, character names, and custom design work, require input from the reward backer. For these rewards, the backer must respond within 6 weeks of the information being requested (most likely by BackerKit pledge manager survey, occasionally by direct e-mail) in order to maintain the project development and manufacturing timeline. Onyx Path will make a strong effort to acquire this information, but should the backer not provide it in a timely fashion, all parties agree that Onyx Path can move forward on the project without the information or using an appropriate substitution and the respective backer will consider the reward obligation fulfilled in full for payment or donations pledged and collected on the part of Onyx Path. The simple fact is that we cannot delay the production of the product due to a unresponsive backer, that's just not fair to the others who have supported this project.\n\nADDRESS CONFIRMATION & DELIVERY OBLIGATIONS. If you confirm your pledge prior to final address confirmation and initiation of distribution notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods. Failure to confirm mailing address prior to final request and distribution notification will be taken as agreement that all obligations have been met and no further action or effort is required on the part of Onyx Path. We will attempt to alert you via the methods provided by Kickstarter and/or BackerKit, primarily e-mail, prior to distribution of rewards to avoid any issue, but once we\u2019ve made all reasonable efforts, we must move on with other business and will be unable to make exceptions.\n\nDIGITAL REWARDS. You will be notified by BackerKit when digital rewards become available to you. Typically, these will be links to load PDF titles into your account library on DriveThruRPG.com. The links from BackerKit must be activated within 90 days to ensure the titles are added to your library, after which the links may expire and Onyx Path may not be able to provide replacements.\n\nIf you do not accept these terms, please do not pledge on this project but instead wait for the general release.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support":

Now it\u2019s your turn to embark on an epic adventure and make those dreams come true.\nCatch new Temtem on Omninesia\u2019s floating islands, battle other tamers on the sandy beaches of Deniz or trade with your friends in Tucma\u2019s ash-covered fields. Defeat the ever-annoying Clan Belsoto and end its plot to rule over the Archipelago, beat all eight Dojo Leaders, and become the ultimate Temtem tamer!\nThe world of the Airborne Archipelago is filled with creatures, named by the locals as Temtem. Temtem have always been a part of day-to-day life on the islands. They live in harmony alongside humans, helping them with their chores or being loyal and faithful pets.\nThere's also a long tradition of taming wild Temtem and training them to fight in friendly battles against other tamers. In recent years, this has exploded in popularity due to a revolution in Temtem technology. Temtem scientists achieved the creation of the first Digital Temtem while studying new breeding techniques, and this has spurred the development of various commodities to help tamers on their adventures.\nEvery Temtem and every technique they know are assigned a specific type. Each type has strengths and weaknesses against other types so they are one of the most important things you need to think about when planning your Temtem squad. Each Temtem can have up to two types, but techniques can only have one type. There are 12 types in Temtem.\nTemtem battles are the form of competition between tamers in the Airborne Archipelago. Tamers can have up to six Temtem in their squad, but only two at a time will be able to battle. In Temtem, battles are turn-based, so tamers will take turns commanding their Temtem what to do in battle until all Temtem are exhausted and one of the tamers emerges as the winner.\nBattles are focused on 2v2 (although there will be some 2v1 battles against untamed Temtem or 1v1 battles with other players) and we\u2019re committed to keeping random factors out of battles. We\u2019ve seen the frustration that random elements cause, especially in the competitive scene, so we\u2019ve decided to remove them and have made the combat 100% skill and strategy based.\nBreeding is the method of creating new Eggs. Putting two compatible Temtem together will produce a new Egg, and from that Egg a new Temtem will be born! Breeding is the easiest way to create a Temtem with perfect stats, since they will inherit some of the stats of their parents. Breeding will also open the door to new movesets since some of the moves will be inherited, allowing a Temtem to know moves its species might not normally learn.\nBut don\u2019t overbreed your Temtem! Each Temtem will have a genetic degradation value that will lower each time a new Egg is produced, so you can only breed a specific amount of times. Genetic degradation will also be inherited by the new Temtem, so you\u2019ll need to plan beforehand how you\u2019re going to spend the cycles.\nTemtem features a fully fleshed-out story campaign. Journey across six vivid islands and embark on the adventure of becoming a Temtem tamer while fighting against the evil Clan Belsoto.\nOnline components of Temtem will be an addition to the adventure and will allow you to travel through the islands alongside other tamers and battle, trade, or talk with them.\nThe days of traveling solo are over; in Temtem the world is a massively multiplayer one. Tamers from around the world can join and you will be able to see them around you, living the adventure with you and fighting to become the best Temtem tamer. Chill with strangers, make new friends and battle them or trade your goodies; the dynamic online world is full of possibilities.\nTemtem\u2019s campaign will be fully co-op compatible. You will be able to join forces with a friend any time and work together towards your next goal. Catch new Temtem, complete a Route, or face off against a Temtem Leader; all while fighting alongside your friend in dual battles!\nYou\u2019ve traveled over all six islands, you\u2019ve caught every Temtem there is, you\u2019ve trained the perfect squad and defeated all the Dojo Leaders. It looks like you need a well-deserved rest! Buy your own house at Atoll Row and decorate it your way. Buy new furniture, color your walls and you\u2019ll be ready to invite your friends over!\nAtoll Row is divided into neighborhoods, acting as instances, with persistent houses from all the tamers in the game. You\u2019re going to be able to visit any house any time and inspire yourself with new ideas for your own house.\nCustomize your character to stand out from the crowd and get new cosmetics while you battle other tamers. Pick a silly hat, a comfy sweatshirt, some pants and you\u2019re ready to go! Or maybe you prefer to wear a full-on cosplay of your favorite Temtem?\nTemtem battles are the most important aspect of every new tamer\u2019s job. Competitive battles take it up a notch and let you battle other tamers with similar skill levels. Begin to plan your strategy even before the battle with pick and ban phases and escalate the ranked ladders.\nStart by choosing 10 Temtem and the pick and ban phase will begin. Take turns with your rival to pick your Temtem and ban theirs. When all the decisions are made and the turns are ended, you will end up with a squad of 4 Temtem and the battle will begin.\nWelcome to the Airborne Archipelago, novice tamers!\nThese are the floating islands where Temtem and humans coexist peacefully. Each island is a whole different world, but there is something we all have in common \u2013 our love for Temtem and Temtem fighting! Intrepid tamers like yourself travel on airships to the furthest reaches of the Archipelago to find the best Temtem. Every young tamer dreams of becoming the best\u2026\nBut not everything is fun and peace in the islands. Behind the scenes, Clan Belsoto is weaving a dastardly conspiracy against Temtem and humans alike. You will need all the friends and your best Temtem to defeat the wicked Clan Belsoto.\nDeniz is a Mediterranean paradise of glittering seas where Water and Wind Temtem abound. Walk the streets of Turquesa, explore the ruins of an ancient fort or just chill on the shores of Indigo Lake.\nArbury\u2019s pride is its University. The fierce dons of Lochburg swear by their Melee Temtem, against the sophisticated Properton academics, who favour Mind Temtem.\nOmninesia (\u201dthe Myrisles\u201d) is a cluster of tropical islets connected by rope bridges, home of Nature and Fire Temtem. Enjoy the luxury of Atoll Row and investigate the lava caves of the Anak volcano.\nCipanku dabbles in mysticism and well as technology. The labs of Nanto produce Digital Temtem, while the monks revere the Electric Temtem in remote hills among rice paddies.\nTucma, \u201cThe End of All Things\u201d \u2013 a vast desolation of ashes, noxious lakes and Toxic Temtem. Under the surface, the mining city of Quetzal is home to artisans, rock-hoppers and Crystal Temtem.\nKisiwa is a sun-drenched savanna. Eastern Kisiwa boasts an unrivalled variety of Neutral Temtem, while the western deserts are home to the best Earth Temtem.\nClan Belsoto is a shady and enigmatic organization. Nobody knows who its true leader might be, but some of its captains are well-known:\nLady Lottie is an arrogant Arburian aristocrat, with the aloof manners of an exiled queen. Her delusions of grandeur conceal her dangerous skill in Temtem battles.\nGeneral X is a stern Denizan officer, fond of strict discipline and blind obedience. He is using Clan Belsoto to realize his own dreams of conquest and domination.\nDr. Hamijo is a disgraced Cipanki scientist, who now applies his knowledge to the advancement of the wicked plans of Clan Belsoto, using genetically modified Temtem when challenged to a duel.\nCrema is a game studio based in Madrid, Spain. We\u2019ve been making videogames for almost six years now and we\u2019ve always been focused on delivering great gameplay experiences.\nOur previous productions include:\nInstant Buttons: Our first app, which to date has over 20 million downloads.\nOh My Goat: Featured by Apple and amassed over half a million downloads.\nRidiculous Triathlon: Also featured by Apple and publicly and critically acclaimed.\nImmortal Redneck: Our first foray into the PC and console market, with over 94% positive feedback on Steam.\nWe\u2019ll be working with the award-winning composer Damian Sanchez for all of the audio requirements of Temtem. Damian is an amazing composer who has worked on games like Rise & Shine, Reservoir Dogs: Bloody Days, and Blues and Bullets, and has become one of the most renowned composers in the Spanish gamedev community.\nDamian has been working side-by-side with us on most of our games, and our collaboration with him goes back to 2015 when we were working on Ridiculous Triathlon. Since then he\u2019s been our music guy for every project we\u2019ve had, and most recently he\u2019s been responsible for the awesome Immortal Redneck soundtrack.\nAs an exclusive reveal, you can now listen to the first theme on Temtem\u2019s soundtrack:\nOur company has been self-funded for almost 6 years while making our previous games, and now we have most of the funding for Temtem already on our arks. The Kickstarter will help just a bit on the financial side, but we especially want it for the community creation aspect. We really want to develop the game around the community and open the development.\nWith our previous game, Immortal Redneck, it became clear that we should have involved the community early on in development and not have waited for the game\u2019s release to start receiving feedback. We made some assumptions that led to us not putting enough effort into certain areas of the game, and that ended up hurting the game\u2019s perception by the public and got us off to a not-so-great start.\nWe want to change that, and Kickstarter is the perfect way to do it. We want our backers to be involved in the development, watch our day-to-day updates and provide feedback along the way. We plan to maintain an open development through our Discord server, especially with our Alpha Hero backers (and above) that will be testing the game from a very early stage and will help us shape the future of Temtem.\nLastly, since Temtem is very influenced by a well-known franchise, we aren\u2019t really sure how positive the public reception is going to be. Kickstarter allows us to show the game to the public and gather feedback early on. We want to expand the well-known franchise and add features requested by its users for years, but we need to see if there\u2019s enough interest in that before embarking on this massive adventure.\nSince August 2017 when development began, we\u2019ve been focused on laying the foundation of every aspect of the game and creating content for the Kickstarter campaign. We\u2019ve been defining the pipeline for each area of development and we\u2019re now ready to begin full production and start creating the final content for the game.\nWe\u2019re currently focused on creating a first Alpha, and from there we plan to iterate with the community.

A day-night cycle, a dynamic weather system, random encounters and sector-wide anomalies drain your stamina and resources as you go places. \nGuided Randomization - Each playthrough consists of multiple 'sectors' which are created via a complex combination of presets and procedural generation, making no game ever the same. \nEach Action Card represents a tactical opportunity. Use them wisely!\nTrading Card Game - You also have access to 'Action Cards' - a game element that only strengthens the tabletop feel of Pixel Princess Blitz. You can play them to escape a tight spot, increase your odds of survival and bend the rules! For example, you can play 'Stealth' to move safely through a chaotic battlefield, or play 'Instigation' on a town to raise a militia when monsters are nearby.\nThe town is besieged by Ratlings! Don't just stand there, do something!\nA Living World - The world is populated with towns, monsters and factions that all follow their own agenda. Armies fight over vantage points and supply centers, Monsters sprawl across the land and towns deploy guards and adventurers to defend themselves.They are playing an RTS among themselves, and you possess the power to be a game changer. Protect towns, sabotage supply lines, take out commanders and solve problems(and more).\nImagine two factions having bases around the sector and sending out patrols and armies to outdo the other one. If you sabotage one faction by taking out their outposts and patrols, this will naturally lead to the other faction gaining the upper hand, quite possibly leading to their victory.\nWhether you intervene or not is entirely up to you. The factions will engage each other no matter if you're there or not, so if you don't care what they do... then don't get involved. This is YOUR JOURNEY.\nRandomized Loot & Arms Race\nAn Innovative Character Customization System!\nLoot Generator - Acquire and trade in a huge variety of weapons, gears and items which are all generated at random! An item could have multiple positive and negative attributes, be upgraded or degraded in quality, enchanted or cursed, common, rare, or unique - You won't see the same equipment twice.\nAn Arms Race - Utilize your limited time and resources carefully to keep your arsenal up to date, as your enemies keep getting stronger and the environment more dangerous as you progress. Falling behind in this ever-intensifying arms race will only mean your death.\nDungeoneering like Never Before\nIn PPB, we treat dungeons not as a static collection of rooms, but like a board game played against another player. AI-controlled Dungeon Overseers are put in charge of each dungeon, taking every available step to kill the intruder - reparing rooms, facilities and sending out hunting parties after you. You must think strategically and act tactically to overcome this cunning opponent.\nMind the Gap\nImmersive Storytelling\nA Meaningful Adventure - experience a non-linear gameplay enhanced by a elaborately prepared narrative told through long campaigns and random events. We believe that even the best sandbox game would soon run dry if it doesn't tell a meaningful story or give you context to your efforts. \nTrue Role-playing - I believe that a good RPG is not about letting you choose your sex or change your looks, but enabling you to make meaningful choices that result in logical consequences! Most encounters in PPB will offer multiple choices and different solutions. Like in Tabletop RPG, the game will role a die to determine your success, adding relevant modifiers such as equipment, skill or stats. \nSoundtrack - Pixel Princess Blitz's gorgeous high-quality music, composed by Ethan Jeffrey, does a fantastic job of setting the tone of the adventure, quickly becoming an integral part of the world of PPB.  \n<Main Theme of Pixel Princess Blitz>\nSound Effects - The often overlooked silent laborers. We are working with Aaron C. Edwards, a professional sound generalist with more than 12 years of experience, to create hundreds of SFX for Pixel Princess Blitz.\nthe game boasts a huge cast of high-quality pixel art characters, crafted and animated the traditional way by Japanese artists without relying on visual tricks, just as those classic JRPGs, fighting games and Beat'em-ups were made back in the old days.\nErin is fighting the air for some unknown reason...\nWe start with the first sketches...\ncontinue filling the frames in between...\nAnd brush it up!\nThe pixel art of PPB distinguishes itself with its crisp shapes and clear colors. We've also taken extra time and effort to come up with new and elaborate designs, instead of filling the game with just floating enemies or washed-out shapes and fuzzy details.\nKnight Mantis\nSwamp Lord\nWe have removed most physical rewards so we don't get distracted off the actual development. Though high amount of pledges would help us for sure, I believe that finishing this game should be our top priority, and the fulfillment process of physical rewards introduces a new risk that could topple the entire undertaking.\nEarly Access Key :\nGet a DRM-free copy of the game via Steam when we enter Early Access. You'll retain your access even when we move to full release of version 1.0. (You can also choose to receive a key for the platform of your choice)\nInvitation to Closed Beta :\nYou will be invited to test out the beta build many months before we hit Early Access - and retain your copy of the game through Early Access and the full release. During Closed Beta, we will reflect your feedback and keep updating the game, so you'd be practically building the game together with us.\nDigital Official Sountrack :\nThe talented Ethan Jeffrey is writing every piece in the magnificent soundtrack of PPB. The digital OST will come with an exclusive cover art that you can admire on your player. Here is another full song from the soundtrack; please enjoy! :)\nOST Booklet :\nA digital booklet with exclusive illusts, sketches, a comic in color, plus an insightful developer commentary about the music and sounds of PPB.\nPPB Guidebook : \n \nThis traveler's guidebook will contain stories, diary entries and interviews written by common people of Verad. It contains a bestiary, information about main factions and characters of PPB, exclusive illusts, comic pages and more.\nDigital Art Book :\nThis gigantic art book will allow you to look behind the curtain, bringing you tons of visual materials, including sketches, concept arts, colored in-game art assets in their original size, pixel-art sprites and more. We have so many materials to show off - you'll like it!\nYour Name in the Game :  \n\nThe name you give us will be put into the random generator to be used at various places. It may be found on the board at a adventurers' guild house, maybe among the 'Heroes of the Month'. The player can compete against other adventurers on that list by racking up renown, and you could be one of those names.\nYour name may also be on the 'Injured Adventurers' board, where the player can donate a few coins and get a better rep. These are great roleplaying opportunities for the player, and you can be a part of that fun experience.\nYour Story in the News :  \nThe game will generate newspapers that report about recent events. Think up a fictional story to be featured on its front page. It can be about yourself, or even just a funny story. Imagine other gamers reading about the discovery of a dangerous ruin, and finding the story about your heroic act beside that: \"Steve from Bullworth wins the annual eating contest for the third time in a row.\" Also, you will be credited as 'Guest Creator'.\nDesign a Unique Item:  \nEquipment items in PPB, such as weapons, shields, armors etc. are randomly generated, but there are also 'unique items' that can look different on the inventory screen and have a few special properties that make them stand out. Work with us to design a unique item with special properties, and if you wish, a lore the player can read after identifying it. You are also free to include your own name in a lore-friendly way.\nThe VAT Incident\nWe ran our first Kickstarter campaign back in 2017 and got funded successfully thanks to the help of our backers, raising 132% of the actual funding goal. We've economized and used the pledges carefully to pay the members of the team for their ongoing effort, and to hire additional members who proved themselves crucial to the project very soon.\nThe post-funding development went pretty smoothly, but we had to spend more time than we had originally allocated because we had to add, remove, remaster and rectify big features, graphic assets and codes while Pixel Princess Blitz kept evolving. (This is the usual process of game development) And that led to a delay with which we were not happy.\nAnd in January 2018, we learned that we have to pay 19% of the funds raised on Kickstarter as VAT(Value-added-tax). This was unexpected because Kickstarter's Q&A section stated that there would be no taxes on the money we spent.\nTaken from the Q&A Section.\n(In retrospect, the article seems to apply to the US-residents only - but this was hard to grasp at that time. It also sounded pretty convenient to me, so I'd stopped bothering from that point on. It's my fault.) \nSolution\nWith that, most of the remaining budget that we'd saved up for the final spurt was gone, and as you could imagine, it's been very stressful. I hope that the uniqueness and the high production value of our game could get you interested enough and maybe convince you to back us in this final Kickstarter campaign before the release of PPB.\nOf course, I've consulted our backers from the first Kickstarter campaign first before considering this. Thankfully, they liked how I've handled the first campaign. To me, the single most important thing is not to disappoint my backers - I wouldn't be attempting this without their blessing.\nI hope that you've enjoyed reading the campaign page and that you will keep our game in a corner of your heart, should you decide to pass on our Kickstarter campaign. Thank you!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAt this point, nothing could threaten the completion of this project. \nUnforeseen delays are still possible, but they won't be due to any grave issues like a team member bolting out, or mismanaging the budget.\n\nSoon we will enter the closed beta phase where we will keep fixing bugs and reflect your feedback in the game through updates, so you'll be able to follow the progress even if our plan to enter Early Access gets delayed.\n\nNo matter what happens, we'll finish this game and keep expanding its contents even long after the release of version 1.0!

Around 18 months ago we challenged ourselves to create a tool that would be light, practical and affordable. \nThe Wootz EDC is the ideal tool for any adventure where weight and space are a consideration. Its versatility makes it a must-have companion for every adventurer, or eighter you\u2019re just grilling in the backyard with a cold one.\nIt's manufactured from the highest-carbon stainless steel and weighs just 1.9 ounces or 55 grams.

Once the campaign is over, we'll collect your color choices in a survey\n                     THE WOOTZ EDC IDEA\nWootz EDC (Every Day Carry) founders wished to reduce the amount of gear you would need when heading into the wild, knowing that every ounce on your back becomes a kilogram when carried over the distance. We began with a simple keychain as a jumping-off point but also wanted to design a tool that would handle every step when preparing a meal around the campfire. \nEvery function of the Wootz EDC had to work great in its own right. For durability, stainless steel 440C was a perfect choice.\nKeep things slick while getting more than just a traditional money clip\nCracking Open A Cold One With The Boys > Tag Your Friends <\n                                                       DESIGN  \nAfter 18 months of design work and hundreds of different prototypes, the Wootz EDC was born. Wootz EDC makes a unique gear, based on our love for barbeque and beer. \nWhether you are backpacking around the world or spending a day in the woods, we want to be with you. \nOur team consists of curios-minded mavericks, creating unique products that are practical, functional and aesthetically pleasing in the real world. \n3D CAD drawings along with 2D dimensions\nComputer-aided design and drafting\nSPECIFICATIONS  \nLight Weight: 1.9oz (55 g)\nBlade Length: 2.3in (5.5 cm)\nBlade Thickness: 0.09in (2.3 mm)\nOpen Body Length: 5.5in (14 cm)\nHandle Length: 3in (8 cm)\nClosed Width: 0.8in (2.2 cm)\nBody Materials: 440C heat treated stainless steel \nHardness: 58-60HRC \nColor: Grey, Matte Black \nLock: Linerlock\nSome of our valued early members have suggested a Tanto blade option for their Wootz EDC.

Set in Aughmoore, the world of Tiny Epic Kingdoms and Heroes of Land, Air & Sea.\nHOOK: Fast paced, portable co-op, with a unique turn-deck mechanic.\nWIN: Defeat the Epic Foe!  \nLOSE: Let your Capital City get destroyed!\nBASE STORY: After the Great War (Tiny Epic Kingdoms), many of the factions, shattered and defeated, looked for something to cling to. One final hope before the last of their race would flow like the river into the ocean of history, gone and forgotten. It was the sages of the Order of Gamelyn who answered their prayers. They provided a new perspective on unity, and a way of life that would welcome peaceful members of any faction. A utopia for all. With very few options and a will to survive, this world alliance became an inevitable truth in the eyes of many of the factions\u2019 leaders. Even factions who hated one another had nothing left but each other. Under the guidance of the Order of Gamelyn, a Capital City was chosen and factions from all over the world came to call this city their new home. At last, the world was at peace\u2026 but not for long. A great storm is coming and in the darkness of the mist, there be demons.\nEXPANSION STORY: Aughmoore is in ruins. The evil could not be contained and its darkness has spread to every region of the world. Shattering villages and infecting all forms of life. There has never been a more dire need for Heroes. Everyone who remains must rise up, must unite, and must risk everything to preserve what little spirit remains.\nTiny Epic Defenders: The Dark War, an expansion to Tiny Epic Defenders, is the latest installment in Chronicles of Aughmoore. It introduces new Heroic characters like the Lionkin Charioteer and the Birdfolk Shadow Walker. It also introduces new Epic Foes, new Dire Enemies, and new Artifacts, but more importantly, it introduces new and exciting features that keep players making difficult choices from the edge of their seats.\nThese new features include a Campaign Mode with Enemy Generals, Skills that Heroes can learn, Advanced Regions and Caravans.\nCaravans represent the shattered homes of villagers during this dark time and are spread across all the Regions. Players are faced with the additional challenge of rescuing these Caravans and escorting them safely to the Capital City before they are can defeat the Epic Foe.\nSkills are useful abilities players can assign to their Heroes and require Experience Points to activate. Experience Points are now earned during play by making meaningful decisions that help the party reach their goals.\nThe Campaign Mode plays like an evolving gauntlet challenge, where players must play through the game multiple times, facing Generals at the intervals instead of the regular Epic Foe. The different abilities players will have at their disposal, as well as the threats they face, are unique to each Campaign and evolve with the choices players make during each Campaign. If players can survive long enough, they will face an Epic Foe at the conclusion of the Campaign.\nThe Advanced Regions introduce new threats and also new abilities to aid the players in The Dark War. These new threats and abilities come in the way of 3D constructs like a giant Tree Heroes can hide in, a flying Manticore Heroes can ride, or mysterious Sandstorms! They play a big part in the evolving Campaign Mode. Each Advanced Region features a dark, harmful, side and a light, helpful, side. As players progress through the Campaign Mode, they will work to restore the dark regions to their helpful side. Making the right choices to restore these Regions and rescue the Caravans is critical to achieving victory in Campaign Mode.\nOwn the original Tiny Epic Defenders and curious about what the changes are? Here's what's changed: \nAll new art, component upgrade to include ITEMeeples\u00ae, gameplay changes to give players more control over the outcome of the game, and as a result, it's more fun!

It\u2019s also, thanks to the support of over 12,000 backers, one of the biggest board game worlds ever created!\nThe game became a reality thanks to over 12,000 backers, but the cost of making such a game is so high that a retail version is almost unfeasible. However, we wanted to give you another opportunity to get your hands on it: your last chance\u2026 to get cursed.\nThe Expansion \u201cWhat Goes Up, Must Come Down\u201d invites you to come and discover, or perhaps return to, The 7th Continent for some fresh adventures! Two new curses are waiting, each with their own unique gameplay elements, for you to discover.\nIn \u201cA Prison of Clouds\u201d you\u2019ll find yourself aboard a Hot Air Balloon, in search of salvation and in \u201cThe Veins of the Earth\u201d you will delve deep below the Continent in order to triumph over the Evil consuming you.\n\u201cEasily one of my favourite games of the year. This is an amazing game and possibly the best adventure board game ever designed. Excellent!\u201d\nTom Vasel \u2013 The Dice Tower\n\u201cThe 7th Continent is the best exploration game I\u2019ve ever played.

This is a must-buy!\u201d\nJamey Stegmaier \u2013 Stonemaier Games\n\"The 7th Continent is quite simply a watershed moment in enthusiast gaming. Encapsulating all that was great from the LucasArts adventure games of the past, Serious Poulp has crafted an analog experience that continually inspires exploration and invokes a constant sense of wonder.

Each one will provide a unique experience, pushing the survival skills of both novice and veteran explorers to the limit.\nThis new expansion has its own \u201ccollector\u2019s\u201d box that \u2013 combined with the base box \u2013 can store all of the cards of the base box as well as all of the expansions (even if everything is sleeved) and other materials.

When you wish to take off again, simply make your way back to the card where you landed and your aerial adventure continues.\nTake care though, as each trip will tax you. Hunger, confinement and violent winds will test your nerves.\nMake short trips and improve your piloting abilities if you want to stand a chance of lifting the curse that keeps you trapped in this hopeless land.\n\u201cThe Veins of the Earth\u201d will drag you down into the bowels of the earth where an underground network of serpentine waterways spans the entire length of the continent.\nAboard a barge of aboriginal design, your actions will be limited as the current draws you ever deeper.

It matters not, as long as you can free yourself from this curse!\n\"Satchel & Journal\" Binder\nThis new accessory will allow you to store all the \u201cQuest Item\u201d cards that you\u2019ll acquire during your adventures, just as if you were jotting them down in your journal!\n1907. A renowned explorer, you have just returned from the first expedition on the seventh continent, a mysterious land that was recently discovered off the coast of Antarctica and is very likely the last Terra Incognita in the world.\nYou are recovering from your adventure when, whilst reading the daily newspaper, you realize that several other members of the expedition have disappeared suddenly, for unknown reasons.\nCoincidentally, you have been lethargic for a few days, feeling feverish and finding it difficult to get out of bed. A cold shiver runs down your spine and you are in a constant state of depression and malaise.\nYou are going to have to face the facts: an evil is consuming you from within. When night falls, you slip into a restless sleep unaware that, for you, this is only the beginning...\nYou start each new game by choosing one of the available characters.

Find out how to lift the curses you have chosen and then purge your soul of them. Each curse offers a very unique adventure and will take you to different places. Obtain the unobtainable, discover that which is forever hidden, and strive against the impossible.\nDo you have what it takes?\nA Curse that you can attempt to lift and its clue.\nYou are now ready to begin your unexpected adventure. Similar to the books where \"you are the hero\u201d, you will explore the continent by putting numbered Terrain and Permanent event cards into play, which will gradually form the game board.\nForests, deserts, caves and mountains - you will visit dozens of different locations during your adventures as well as encounter random events that coincide with your location.\nTo progress through the game, you will perform the actions available on the Terrain card your miniature is standing on, the Event cards attached to it, and the Character, Skill, State and Bonus cards in your hand and the Items in your inventory.\nIn order to perform these actions, you will use the Action Deck that contains your Skills and simultaneously serves as your life force.\nEvery action makes you draw a certain number of cards from the Action Deck. These cards provide a variable amount of successes and you must obtain a specified number of them in order to succeed.\nFight action: draw 2 or more cards from the Action Deck to perform the action. Get 1 or more achievements to succeed.\nFailing when performing an action may have terrible consequences and cause you to get negative State cards, forcing you to discard cards from the Action Deck, and consequently reducing your life force.\nFall off this peak and you will likely get injured.\nWant to stack the odds in your favour? You may choose to draw more cards from the Action Deck to get more successes. However, every card in the Action Deck is a bit of your life force, so when the Action Deck is exhausted, so are you. From now on, every action could be your last!\nThankfully, the Skill cards that you may add to your hand when performing actions, your Bonus and Item cards, and the help from your companions will make things easier for you. This is especially true when it comes to decreasing the number of cards you must draw to perform an action or by increasing your chances of success.\nA faithful companion and a precious item.\nThe 7th Continent is a strange land with many paranormal events, hostile creatures and inhospitable locations.\nYou will have to use your best survival skills to overcome the varied threats you will face in this land, so that you can eventually lift your curses:\nFind or craft items to help you escape risky situations or access locations that would normally be unreachable without them.\nGather food, by hunting or fishing, in order to regain some life force, returning Action cards from the discard pile to your Action deck. Make a fire and cook it and you\u2019ll find that you\u2019ll get even more cards back!\nLook carefully at your environment. It contains many clues and hidden numbers that can help you uncover the Continent\u2019s many secret locations.\nThere are countless surprises for you to experience along your journey!\nA page from your journal that now allows you to use this plant when you see it on your Terrain card.\nYou can download the rules (.pdf \u2013 56 Mo) or check this video (26\u2019) to learn how to play The 7th Continent!\n\nEdit: cards from The Past must be returned between two game sessions.\nAll the expansions and optional purchases from the original Kickstarter will be available during the course of the second campaign.\nHow to add optional buys to my pledge?\n1.

Without them, we wouldn\u2019t be here today.\nThe cost of making this game is high, notably due to the quality of its components. Due to this a retail version of the game is almost unfeasible.\nHowever, we want the game to live and continue growing as well as allowing those that missed out on the first campaign and/or some of its contents to acquire them.\nThis campaign is no doubt one of your last chances to take part in The 7th Continent adventure...\nThis new campaign will allow you to expand upon the adventure we all began back in 2015. With new curses and mechanics, a whole new experience awaits you! It will also allow you to acquire any elements you may have missed from the first campaign.\nFor those of you only interested by the \u201cupgrade pack\u201d: you will be able to procure it (at production cost) at our online store at www.seriouspoulp.com when it becomes available in 2018.\nFree Upgrade pack\nThis pack contains cards that will allow those of you possessing the first edition of the game to upgrade it to the second edition and 4 additional dividers to help you search for cards more easily (Characters' Skills, \"004\", \"051\", \"109\"). It includes any cards that may have been changed or corrected after the first campaign.\nNOTE: This pack is included in the Veteran pledge (which is specifically for those with a copy of The 7th Continent from the first Kickstarter campaign)\nNew Content\nIf you purchased all available content from the previous campaign and wish to complete your collection, then all you\u2019re missing is:\nThe expansion \u201cWhat Goes Up, Must Come Down\u201d: this expansion includes two new curses along with new ways to explore the continent.\nSatchel & Notebook binder: this game accessory will allow you to store all the cards that would normally be placed under the Satchel & Journal card.\nAll unlocked Stretch goals that become available during the campaign.\nThese items are included in the Veteran pledge.\nAlso, new \u201coptional purchases\u201d will become available during the campaign (see \"Optional buys\" section). \nThe USA, European Union, Canada and Australia will all be \u201cShipping Friendly\u201d. This means that backers from these countries will not incur any import taxes.\nAfter our experience with the first campaign, we are planning on two waves of shipping for this new project.\nThe First Wave will include the new \"Second edition\" base box and non-cards optional purchases (such as bone dice & dice bag, sleeves, etc.). This wave is slated for March 2018.\nThe Second Wave, due in October 2018, will include the new expansion \"What Goes Up, Must Come Down\", all optional buys with cards (old and new) as well as Stretch Goals from this campaign.\nShipping will be paid AFTER THE END OF THE CAMPAIGN, during the \u201cPledge Manager\u201d phase. Below, you will find an estimation of shipping costs per shipping area. Despite this, we are committed to these prices being the maximum amount you will have to pay.\nDuring the \u201cPledge Manager\u201d phase, you can ask to receive everything, including the Base Box, in Wave 2 (due in October 2018) in order to reduce shipping costs significantly when compared to the cost of both waves (although still more expensive than the wave 2 shipping shown below).\n*You can choose to have this optional buys shipped on wave 2 \u2013 instead of wave 1 \u2013 to avoid paying for the shipping fee associated.\n**Europe (A): Germany, United-Kingdom, Republic of Ireland, Belgium, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Switzerland and Austria.\n**Europe (B): Denmark, Estonia, Greece, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Sweden, Czech Republic.\n**Europe (C): Albania, Armenia, Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Croatia, Finland, Iceland, Montenegro, Norway, Serbia, Turkey, Ukraine (Note: the lower part of the estimate).\nNote: recently updated for GREECE, ROMANIA and SWEDEN.\nAlso, South Korea is in Area 4 \u2013 lower part of the estimate\nWould you like to pledge for multiple copies?\nEach copy purchased includes all unlocked Stretch Goals. For areas 1, 2 and 3, shipping costs after the first pledge (up to a maximum of 7) are halved! We are still looking for solutions to get some discount for multiple copies for areas 4 and 5 as well (hopefully by the end of the campaign).\nWe\u2019re two friends that love playing and making games. Also, one of us is pretty handy with a pencil.\nFounded in 2010, Serious Poulp was all about seeing the games we designed come to life.\nSerious Poulp Inc. is the name of the North American branch of Serious Poulp. It was created in 2017 to help us develop our business in North America.\nThe first Kickstarter campaign for The 7th Continent was successfully funded back in October 2015 thanks to the support of 12,103 daring explorers! Two years later, with a lot of experience from this first adventure under our belts, we\u2019re back with some new ideas that we just couldn\u2019t keep to ourselves!\nLudovic Roudy and Bruno Sautter\nTwo friends passionate about all things gaming! We\u2019ve been working together for almost 15 years in the digital communication agency we created in 2002, then as Serious Poulp, which we founded in 2010, when the temptation to publish games became too strong to resist.\nRole-playing games and gamebooks played a significant part in both our childhoods. Bruno was 5 when \u201cThe Warlock of Firetop Mountain\u201d was published. Ludovic was 11 and already had a few prototypes on the go (one of which would eventually become The 7th Continent!).\nWe've been inspired by many great works during our lives, whether from board games, role-playing games or video games. When we started out in the board gaming industry, we naturally brought all of these elements with us.\nWe are not only the designers of the 7th Continent - Ludovic also creates all of the illustrations and visual elements for our games and Bruno, apart from writing cards and rulebooks, supervises production.\nJamie \u201cWhelpslayer\u201d Johnson\nJamie is the Community Manager for The 7th Continent and the scourge of small draconic beings. Rolling dice, pushing toy soldiers and trading sheep for many a moon now, Jamie is, just like you guys, a gamer at heart. He\u2019s also a publisher himself with his own company, Holy Grail Games. Some of you may recognize him from the first Kickstarter campaign.\nTo our families and friends for their incredible support and patience as we created the cursed land of the 7th Continent.\nTo our proofreaders and translators who did an outstanding job!\nTo Olivier Nkweti for his great work on miniatures.\nTo the amazing Gary Chalk, Joe Dever, Didier Guiserix, Gary Gygax, Steve Jackson and Ian Livingstone for their inspirational work.\nTo all the backers of the first campaign who helped us make this dream a reality.\nTo you, previous and first-time backers, who will allow us to keep on dreaming!\nThank you all!\nWe wish you a not too gruesome demise in the land of The 7th Continent!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe re-printing of the base box does not pose any issues. \n\nWork on the new expansion has already begun and we are confident in our ability to meet the announced deadlines.\n\nWe will, of course, be keeping you updated about the state of the project through each and every stage. \n\nREFUNDS\n\nAll pledges can be refunded up to the completion of the Pledge Manager, no questions asked.\n\nIf the refund is requested more than 60 days after the end of the Kickstarter campaign, 10% will be deducted from the amount (corresponding to the charges incurred by Kickstarter and Stripe, since we will not be refunded at that point), and the refund will have to be done via PayPal instead of the Credit Card you used on Stripe.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nAll prices shown in \u20ac (Euros) are based on the conversion rate in effect at the start of the campaign (09-25-2017) which is $1 = \u20ac0.84\n\nBy pledging to this Kickstarter, you acknowledge that the final appearance, materials and content of the rewards (and the Kickstarter) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented while the Kickstarter project is active.\n\nYou agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information, and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods.

This patent pending device brushes all your teeth at once, fully automatic, and finishes in just ten seconds. All you have to do is press a single button, wait ten seconds, and you\u2019ll have perfectly clean teeth!\nLet's face it: brushing your teeth is not exactly the sexiest thing on Earth. You have to squeeze, scrub, gargle, spit, rinse and floss every morning and evening, every day of your life. Many of us hate brushing our teeth so much that we avoid doing so whenever possible\u2014even though we know we shouldn\u2019t... Brushing our teeth at least twice a day maintains good dental health. This is why we invented Amabrush\u2014a device three years in the making with a single goal: to make toothbrushing quicker, automatic, and more efficient so you have more time for the relevant things in your life.\nAmabrush is not meant to be better than your regular toothbrush. Wait, what? That's true! Regular toothbrushes (manual and electric) are tools. And tools are only as good as the person using it! The key thing is that most of us use them wrong, or even worse, are not using them at all. \nBrushing teeth is a job where you must be highly concentrated. Toothbrushes should be held like pencils, so that pressure is as light as possible. The bristles should be soft, in order to not damage your gums. And you should just wiggle the toothbrush with subtle vibrations, instead of doing long strokes. Electric toothbrushes are handled differently than manual ones. With them, you shouldn't stroke at all. These toothbrushes are designed to be held in place, so that the micro vibrations of the bristles can do their job (they wiggle for you).\nAmabrush covers all of the recommended methods. The bristles are aligned in a 45\u00b0 angle against the gum line, and are soft enough in order to rub instead of scratch (like nylon bristles). And the pressure against your teeth is light. Subtle vibrations move the bristles back-and-forth, which allows them to remove plaque and keep your gums undamaged.\nAmabrush is for people like us - who just brush their teeth because they have to, and not because they want to.\nAmabrush was designed to make toothbrushing less annoying. Some of us hate toothbrushing so much, that we brush not concentrated enough, not long enough, not good enough, or not at all. And some of us simply can not brush correctly at all, because they are not able to do so. It is still under development, and currently for people with healthy gum and teeth. This is our goal. Right toothbrushing for everyone and automatically!\nAmabrush is made out of three parts:\nThe Mouthpiece\nThe Handpiece\nThe Toothpaste Capsules\nAntibacterial Material\nThe flexible mouthpiece has built-in micro-channels that transport the toothpaste to your teeth. The mouthpiece is made of antibacterial silicone that kills 99.99% of all bacteria and features 3D-arranged bristles on both sides to clean your teeth. It\u2019s soft enough to prevent gum damage but strong enough to clean your teeth precisely. It can be cleansed by normal rinsing, as you would do it with regular toothbrushes.\nBrushing Technique\nThe bristles are directed in a 45\u00b0 angle against your gingival cuff. This simulates the Bass method, which is recommended by dentists and experts. The bristles are comparable to soft-bristled toothbrushes. This ensures the most comfortable, safest toothbrushing and makes gum-damage impossible. We work closely with dentists and dental universities to address two concerns: clean teeth and no gum damage.\nSingle Size\nWe analyzed over 2,000 different jaws from adult females and males. The small difference between both genders is smoothed out by the flexible material of the mouthpiece. The used material has the characteristic to fit every jaw with no abnormal teeth displacements.\nReplacement\nAs with regular manual toothbrushes and electric toothbrush heads, the mouthpiece should be replaced every 3-6 months. Many studies prove that used bristles are not as effective in terms of plaque removal, as new ones. A single mouthpiece will cost \u20ac6.\nElectronics\nThe handpiece contains all of the complex technology. It creates strong vibrations with an amplitude of 9.5G to oscillate the bristles and clean your teeth. A clever algorithm ensures the generation of different vibrations. This results in a coordinated movement of the bristles, which are designed to have different resonant frequencies.\n10 Seconds\nAmabrush can brush your teeth in just 10 seconds, because all your teeth are cleaned simultaneously. Even in this 10 seconds, every tooth surface is cleaned longer compared with common toothbrushes. If you brush your teeth for the recommended 120 seconds with a regular toothbrush (manual or electric), every surface gets brushed for just 1.25 seconds (given the fact that you have 32 teeth and every teeth has three surfaces). Amabrush brushes all your surfaces for whole 10 seconds. This means: every tooth surface gets brushed 8x longer and the total toothbrushing duration is 12x quicker.\nPump, Battery & Charging\nA built-in mechanism foams and delivers the right amount of toothpaste to your teeth, and the integrated battery lasts for 28 sessions of toothbrushing. So if you go on vacation without the charging station, you can brush your teeth for at least two weeks twice a day.\nThe handpiece also comprises a low-energy wireless charging module (Qi). So yes, you could even use your wireless smartphone charger to charge Amabrush.\nSharing\nA magnetic connection on the handpiece gives you the opportunity to use Amabrush with different people. Simply put the mouthpiece near the handpiece, and the strong magnet will automatically do the rest for you. We were told that \"it really works like magic,\" and we think the same.\nNotice: if you want to share Amabrush with different people, you just need a single handpiece! Everyone needs their own mouthpiece, but you don't have to get a separate handpiece for every person!\nReplacement & Varieties\nThe toothpaste capsules are simply placed into the handpiece, automatically providing the perfect amount of toothpaste each time you brush your teeth. A single capsule lasts for more than a month, costs \u20ac3 and is available in three different, FDA-approved varieties: Extra Fresh (blue), Whitening (white) and Sensitive (rose - without fluoride). The toothpaste is specially formulated as it needs to be more liquid than regular ones.\nManufacturing\nThe toothpaste is formulated and produced by a major toothpaste manufacturer with a history of over 100 years. This manufacturer fulfills the quality norm DIN EN ISO 13485 and the requirements of IFS Household and Personal Care Products, and was one of the first manufacturers in Europe retrieving the IFS-HPC certificate.\nMagnetic Connection\nToothpaste Foam\n                                   Magnetic Connection\nVideo of using Amabrush prototype. Plaque was buildup on teeth by not brushing them for 30h. This is not meant as a proper clinical trial or plaque test, but as a demonstration of brushing teeth with Amabrush.\nPLAY\n\nPLAY\n\n          \n           Amabrush with Wireless Charging Station (included in Amabrush Pro packages)\n                                                                                                                           Further questions?\nPlease feel free to contact us any time via email or Facebook.\nPlease choose your package on the top right of this page.\nUSB-C instead of micro-USB! We got this request really often, and we too think that this is a great way to build Amabrush with top-notch technology right from the beginning. Many of you demanded such an upgrade, and your request is our command!\nFurthermore, we will offer a lid with integrated UV light as an add-on. This protects the mouthpieces of Amabrush from dust and other environmental influences, and sanitizes the mouthpieces with UV light. This is able to store and sanitize two mouthpieces. This is an accessory for the mouthpiece-storage-attachment (that comes included in the pro version). It features a door with a hinge, a mirrored interior panelling in order to get the most out of the UV lamp, and is a great addition in order to keep Amabrush hygienic and clean. You can add the add-ons to your order after the campaign ends.\nChoose between various different add-ons. The images above shown are for illustration purpose only! We'll offer a traveller case in order to store your Amabrush conveniently and hygienic when you are on vacation. Furthermore, our charging station will be modular. That means, if you use Amabrush on your own, you can simply detach the mouthpiece slots that are designed to store additional mouthpieces. All pro versions come with a charging station and two slots included. What's more, we will offer a tongue cleaner made out of the same antibacterial material, in order to keep your tongue smooth and clean. You can find additional details and choose these items after the Kickstarter campaign.\nYou requested this, we deliver it. All Amabrush units come equipped with a sound and light indicator, that is able to signal various different information about the current battery status, finished toothbrushing sessions, errors and other scenarios! Furthermore, we'll offer our specifically formulated toothpaste in big bottles, along with more durable and stable refillable toothpaste capsules. This will save shipping fees and total cost for you. Please have a look at our add-on section below the reward section for further details.\nYour request is our command! We will integrate Bluetooth to all of our rewards at no additional cost. With our Amabrush App for iOS & Android, you are able to connect to your Amabrush unit and make use of various possibilities. You can set different vibration modes (gum massage, whitening, burst mode, ...), configure cleaning time, reorder replacement parts and do many things more!\n                                                                                                 We truly believe in Kickstarter as a platform, where like-minded entrepreneurs and early adopters bring together innovative, disruptive and sophisticated projects to life. We already supported a dozen projects from other people on Kickstarter on our own.\nAmabrush is a completely new device and needs to be \"understood\" in the first place. Kickstarter connects us with people like us; fact-interested, early-adopting and technology-enthusiastic people.\nAmabrush needs your help to fully come to life. Prototypes and pre-production units were financed by ourselves. But the time has come, that we currently face high upfront expenses regarding tooling, certification, studies and minimum quantity purchases. \nWe strongly believe that we've created a product that many people are craving for, ourselves included. Without your support, we can not achieve the vision of future oral care.\nWe do also highly appreciate every feedback and requests regarding Amabrush. If you have something you want to share with us, please feel free to write us any time at feedback@amabrush.com\nWe came up with the idea of an automated toothbrush, simply because we are annoyed by brushing our teeth. Standing in front of the mirror for at least two minutes twice a day, was not really satisfying for us.\nMarvin Musialek, the founder, came up with the first prototype in 2015. Together with Martin Forstenpointner, a talented mechanical engineer, and Alexander Stummer, a sophisticated biomedical engineer, we brought the project to life. Advised by Dr. Hady Haririan, a professional dentist and member of the Medical University of Dentistry in Vienna and Austrian Society of Parodontology, we developed and tested Amabrush to the form it represents now. We've established an enthusiastic and interdisciplinary team, and we work closely with medical universities, dentists, and a lot of test customers, in order to make Amabrush as perfect as it can be. We are supported and funded by the Austrian government, private institutions and the European Commission.\nOur core team:\nWe at Amabrush love high quality products. They are durable, simple and \"just work\". We are proud to say that Amabrush is designed, developed and produced in Austria, Germany and USA. This ensures high quality, quick development and low delivery costs.\n                                           ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOne part of Amabrush is highly complex; the mouthpiece. Such a form is not available on the market, as it is build out of a single material and the sophisticated arranged bristles can not be produced by every random injection molding company. We have a close dialog with our suppliers, who have a lot of experience with such complicated structures, and we implemented their feedback early into our development process.\n\nDespite that, we kept the internal parts simple.

His temples bulged, and his eyes were bloodshot with concentration as he ranted. \"Take one step toward me, and I will obliterate you with my mind!\u201d  \nHalo kept her martial stance, her eyes never leaving the rat\u2019s. \u201cThen do so,\u201d Halo said.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry?\u201d The rat didn\u2019t seem to have anticipated this.  \n\u201cDestroy me,\u201d Halo pressed. \u201cWith your mind. Go ahead, magician.\u201d\n\u201cI am no magician!\u201d the rat screeched. \u201cI am a scientist! I have studied the ancient records of the Old Ones, and I know the true power of the universe! I have mastered 47 of the 100 Theories!\u201d During his tirade, the rat\u2019s bulbous eyes began to water, and he finally did what Halo was waiting for.  \nHe blinked.  \nWhen the rat opened his eyes a fraction of a second later, Halo had leapt into the air. Her foot glowed with a blue aura as she kicked him in the snout. The pain was intense, and the rat could feel his fur and flesh becoming bitterly cold as the blue energy enveloped him. He tried to speak, to unleash his mental attack, but he couldn\u2019t move. The ice cracked and popped as his eyes froze solid. \nHalo nodded in satisfaction as the frozen rat fell over the side of the roof, and turned away from her opponent. She needed tell the Ruling Council that the cult of Labo Tor had infiltrated the monarchy of Korat.\n  \"Welcome once again to a world of fantasy adventure in the ancient future. I\u2019m Eddy Webb, and this is Blayze Rex von Rex. Lurking behind his experiments over there is Sabian Sphynx von Angora.\"\n\"We want to talk to you about Monarchies of Mau. It\u2019s a complete tabletop roleplaying game that acts as a companion game to, and is totally compatible with, my first RPG, Pugmire. The Monarchies of Mau is a nation of cats tenuously comprised of six city-states.\"\n  \"Anyway, they live in the ashes of our world far in the future, seeking danger and mystery. Think Three Musketeers meets Planet of the Apes, but with cats.\"\n\"These cats have been uplifted to use technology and language. Some cats acquire the remnants of human technology, believing them to be literal gifts of magic from ancient, god-like servants. Others seek to create an ideal civilization, using the Precepts of Mau agreed to in the heat of a terrible war.\"\n    \"Enemies of Mau can either be monstrous, like demon-possessed zombies, or simply other misunderstood people, such as the dogs of Pugmire.\"\n\"The world is dangerous and mysterious, but the instincts of a good cat will always be true.\"\n      \"My company, Pugsteady, is working with Rich Thomas at Onyx Path Publishing to expand on our Monarchies of Mau Early Access version (see below).\n\"We\u2019re running this Kickstarter so we can make the best version of Monarchies of Mau that we can, adding more art and writing to make this a complete and amazing product. If funded, we will produce a full-color 7 x 10 hardcover book (about the size of a graphic novel), with around 200+ pages.\n\"One of the highlights of the Monarchies of Mau game include this evocative, mysterious, and family-friendly setting, presented from the perspective of iconic characters like Blayze and Sabian here.\"\n  \"Monarchies of Mau uses a customized version of the 5th Edition rules from the world's most popular fantasy RPG. It's been redesigned for streamlined play, with an emphasis on cooperation and action over competition and violence. Creating heroic and cunning cats is easy, and there are a variety of callings and noble houses that give focus to a cat\u2019s role in society and in the adventuring party. To help you with your decision, I\u2019m providing a copy of Monarchies of Mau Early Access. It\u2019s a playable version of Monarchies of Mau that has over a third of the material you can expect in the final book.\nMonarchies of Mau is totally compatible with Pugmire and uses the same rules system. Mixed cat and dog games are entirely possible and can provide some great roleplaying opportunities!\n\"Once you pledge, you'll be able to look at the very first Backer Only Update here on this site and get the link to download the Monarchies of Mau Early Access PDF so you can start playing right away!\n\"As you can see, this is more than just a bare-bones document, but a glimpse into what the final book could really look like.\"\nTwo Page Spread from the Monarchies of Mau Early Access PDF\n\"With your help, we\u2019ll be able to make a game that not only adults can play among themselves, but also something that people can play with their families.\n\"More than that, we want this Kickstarter to help us put Monarchies of Mau into stores. We love retailers, but we know that modern publishing methods don\u2019t always make it easy for them to get books into their stores. With Monarchies of Mau, we want to try and get at least one print run of the game into their hands, so everyone can get a chance to experience it.\"\n  Eddy and Rich will be discussing Monarchies of Mau on various blogs and podcasts as this Kickstarter runs. \nKeep on the Heathlands\nGeek Cast Live (around 46 minute mark)\nThe Red List\nAnd here are some links to many of the Pugmire and Monarchies of Mau articles and interviews and gaming sessions in the US and around the world that Eddy has been able to amass:\nMedia from Pugmire: https://www.pugsteady.com/pugmire-media/\nOur friends at Geek & Sundry covered us again! http://geekandsundry.com/monarchies-of-mau-brings-cats-into-the-world-of-pugmire/\nAs did our friends at The Arcade! http://www.the-arcade.ie/2017/05/monarchies-mau-tabletop-rpg-pugmire/\nNerd Approved talked about Mau: http://nerdapproved.com/gaming/monarchies-of-mau/\nMonica Valentinelli did a wonderful spotlight of Mau and Eddy on her blog! http://www.booksofm.com/2017/05/friendly-friday-cats-dogs-and-the-imagination-of-eddy-webb.html\nGameosity named Mau as one of Jess's Fav Five Kickstarters of the Week! http://gameosity.com/2017/05/19/jesss-fav-five-kickstarters-of-the-week-51917/\niCv2 mentioned Mau! https://icv2.com/articles/news/view/37585/feline-action-takes-center-stage-monarchies-mau\nTerrible Warriors did a spotlight episode on us! http://www.terriblewarriors.com/episodes/spotlight-monarchies-of-mau-kickstarter\nAcross The Board Games mentioned us as part of their Fund It Friday! http://www.acrosstheboardgames.net/luke/fund-it-friday-may-26th-2/\nMore Gooder Than podcast mentioned Mau (near the end of the episode)! https://soundcloud.com/moregooderthan/goodie-bag-episode-23-appetizer\n  Contribute any amount you want, bearing in mind the levels of contribution and their commensurate rewards over there on the right.

This knowledge has been applied to Onyx Path's partnership with Pugsteady as well as the FAQ below:\nhttp://theonyxpath.com/about/faq/kickstarter/\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRisk: Monarchies of Mau isn't created at all even though the goal is reached.\n\nSolution: We have successfully shipped fifteen Kickstarter projects, Pugmire is being printed, and several more KS projects are headed to completion as you read this. All those books have taught us how the various pieces of the process works, sometimes painfully, and we have increased our ability to judge the various stages of delivery better with each KS. The Early Access PDF is finished and playable and we will be expanding that into the full book\n\nRisk: Shipping costs soak up pledges that were meant to enable the creation of Monarchies of Mau.\n\nSolution: Kickstarter shipping costs have continued to rise dramatically, but we are aware of that and were able to find ways to work with shippers to bring down those costs - unfortunately, only to some extent as we have also needed to up the shipping charges. Both methods allow us to be sure that shipping doesn't eat up the pledge money supposed to go to printing. Because of Kickstarter adding the option to their tools, we are able to be more specific as to shipping costs based on your country. These costs will be added to your pledge automatically by KS if you are outside the US. As always, local or VAT style taxes will need to be paid by the backer when appropriate and are not included in these costs.\n\nRisk: The project will take a long time to produce and anger the backers.\n\nSolution: We've learned many, many lessons with our previous Kickstarters and we're becoming much better at estimating the various pitfalls that will delay a KS project. We were able to deliver the PDFs for several of our last KS projects several months before the estimate, and recent Kickstarters started shipping in the month or the month before we estimated. That being said, backers need to be aware that they are enabling a process, and not a pre-order opportunity, and things do sometimes run slower than we want or anticipate with that process.\n\nWe've found that an open flow of communication between us and the backer community is vital so once the project funds we will deliver regular Updates on progress via Kickstarter as well as in our regular, weekly, Monday Meeting Notes blog at www.theonyxpath.com\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "Mau Supporter", "descp": "You or your cat's name will be listed on the credits page as one of our supporters: our Clowder of Mau.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2018"}], "stat": ["23 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "Wallpaper Fancier", "descp": "You'll get digital wallpaper featuring a collage of the evocative and beautiful art from Monarchies of Mau.

You only have once chance, so don't waste it.\nHowever, not everything is about shooting enemies. By completing each mission, you'll be rewarded with credits that you can spend to improve your characters' skills, upgrade and buy weapons, get better and fancier buildings for your town and improve your whole society.\nA spaceship crashes into an unknown planet. Nomad, the only survivor, wanders in the nearby area looking for food and shelter, however, he runs into a mysterious and broken black stone, hidden under sand dunes. Intrigued, he starts to unbury it and recognizes the stone immediately: It\u2019s The Void, a monolith he\u2019s heard about in ancient legends which talked about the primal power that resided in it.\nSuddenly, The Void activates causing Nomad to enter a state of trance. A vision crosses his mind where the Universe is destroyed. It has communicated with him and has shown him the Truth, but he\u2019s also shown him the way to avoid it. He must rebuild The Void to restore its ancient power, and he\u2019ll need help for that.\nAs if he knew what he should do, Nomad places his hand over The Void, which makes it emit a bright, reddish light ray which seems to split into many into the sky.\nHelp is coming now, and Nomad is the chosen one to drive them through as their leader. \nThe Call has begun.\nNow, he\u2019s got a new purpose.\nThose attracted by the Void\u2019s Call are considered Sons of the Void, or, simply put, Voidlings. Their Calling is considered mysterious as if they suddenly turned conscious about The Void and the fact that It needs their service.\nThey start in the lowest rank of the Sons of the Void Society, and they work their way up by completing missions for it. Their main goal is to investigate throughout the universe in order to track down and get Core pieces that will restore a part of The Void\u2019s power. Power and glory are promised to those who succeed.\nEach Voidling has a different play style and skills that contribute in different ways to your squad, which make them unique and valuable. Therefore, your gameplay experience is different depending on your squad members selection. Find a way that suits you!\nWe'll have at least 9 different Voidlings at launch.\n          Although you have to select your squad, you\u2019re only able to play as one of the members at once. However, you can swap between characters at any given point!\nThere are two kinds of members swap: simple swap and skill swap.\nThe first does as advised, a character will swap for another one instantly.\n\nThe latter, however, will trigger a skill for the swapped in character, for example, The Spike will bounce off incoming bullets for a short period of time, making you invulnerable to bullets (but not to explosions) for a brief time. On the other hand, when swapping The Chevalier in, he'll fall from the skies, stunning all smaller enemies around, letting you move to a safer position or take advantage of the situation. This kind of swap is limited.\nYou can also swap to exploit certain game mechanics: Killing enemies with The Chevalier can cause enemies to explode on death. If that effect is triggered and you swap to The Vermikaze before the explosion, its radius and effectiveness will increase... but only if you've learned those passive skills via the Monolith!\n  The Society asks you to complete several tasks to prove you\u2019re worthy. Tasks for which you\u2019ll have to visit dangerous but intriguing planets, in order to know more about The Void and any clue you can get to restore its power.\nThe Society always offers you three different missions in three different locations, and you can take whichever you prefer.\nTo get to the mission's location you\u2019ll have to use your spaceship, though. Thanks to the LHVC (Large Hadron Vortex Collider) technology, great distances can be covered in a matter of seconds, however, this can cause several secondary effects, although not all of them are necessarily bad.\nThese effects last just for the time you\u2019re doing the mission. They change several aspects of the core gameplay, so you will have to adapt to the new conditions.\nFor example, Oily Feet will make you slide through terrain, but Security will increase every squad member\u2019s life.\n  Although playing Sons of the Void alone is fun, playing it with friends is even funnier!\nIt works like this: Let's say you have 8 available characters to form your mission squad from, with their respective levels, skills tree developed, etc.\nYou friend joins you; Now, both of you can form your squads but with 2 members each, instead of the usual 3. When you both go on missions, your friend will be developing the characters he/she's chosen, too, leveling them up, keeping the weapons he/she get, etc.\nYou are able to prevent progression by simply activating/deactivating an option, if you just want it to be that way.\n  Among all the planets in the universe, there is one you can now call your home. And also you operational base. Here you will be able to manage the Voidlings, upgrade their skills, buy new gear, and many other things.\nYour town will evolve as you play and complete missions.\n  The Void is the one granting you powers as you find different Core pieces throughout the universe. These pieces will recover part of its power back, allowing you to become stronger.\nInteracting with it, the Voidlings can learn and upgrade different skills which turn them into unique characters.\n    Here you can deposit weapons you find during your missions, which allows you to equip them with any character.\nWhen you die, every squad member\u2019s equipped weapons are lost, so the stash is also really useful to hoard weapons in case this happens.\nOur Guardian Dog will be watching over them, so don't worry!\n  Progressing into harder areas might be difficult, but fear not! The Blacksmith will let you upgrade your weapon categories, so you\u2019ll get various bonuses with them.\nYou can also specialize into three weapon for each category, which will turn you into a killer machine with them!\n  Now and then she'll have a bunch of weapons to sell, too!\nThe Sons of the Void Society works with a rank system. You start being a Novice and will have to complete missions to rank up. Higher ranks open new mission types and environments, as well as more difficult ones, and new secondary effects for them. Various weapons drop only on certain rank missions. Also, to progress with the story it\u2019s imperative you rank up!\nThis is how the ranking system works:  \nOn each mission, you receive or lose rank points depending on how well you performed. To rank up you need a specific number of points. If you achieve those required points, you will receive a higher rank badge. If you lose points you may rank down and lose your actual badge.  \nFor example, we need 200 points to be an Apprentice (rank 2). You have 180 points and you just completed a mission which rewards you with 20 points. 180+ 20 = 200, thus you are now an Apprentice. But what if you fail your next mission and every squad member dies on it. You will lose 50 points, and you will be descended to Novice again (rank 1).\n                                              We are Grogshot Games and we\u2019ve been developing games together since 2012!\nAlong these years, we\u2019ve released two mobile projects, the multi awarded Learn Japanese with Tako and Clicker Pirates.\nWe truly think it\u2019s time to focus on PC development, which has always been our one objective.\n  We would like to let you know why we\u2019ve decided on Kickstarter.\nEven though we have some savings and we\u2019ve been working on our own cost for a while, these are limited and unluckily we wouldn\u2019t be able to dedicate full-time to this project otherwise, as we would like to do.  \nWe\u2019re sure this would affect the final quality of the project, so we decided to run a Kickstarter campaign for that matter. This, added to our own savings will let us work full-time on the project and launch it the way we always dreamt of.  \nIn case the funding wasn\u2019t successful, its development would have to be delayed until we were able to find steady, sustainable income.  \nThis funding money will be used for development costs and to pay for the music and sound effects, as we don\u2019t have an in-house sound designer.\nThe distribution would be as this:\n             \nFollow us onTwitter, Facebook, our Web, or check our DevLog in Gamejolt!\nWhat platforms is the game being released on?\n\nIt is going to be released initially on PC/Mac/Linux.

Use a combination of gravity manipulation mechanics, rolling and gliding to build momentum and soar across a wide array of exoplanets. Follow the story of mankind's first, ill-fated mission outside the solar system.\n  EXO ONE has been described by some as \"Kubrick's Tiny Wings\" and \"Journey meets 2001: A Space Odyssey\". The gameplay mechanics are inspired by games like Tiny Wings (iOS), Journey (PS3), and Tribes Ascend (PC). Every aspect of the game is laser focussed towards delivering an entrancing, flowing and exhilarating feeling of movement across a range of utterly alien exoplanets.\nWind down and travel at your own pace. There are no challenges, time limits, wars or enemies.\nAs you traverse these planets, an otherworldly, reverberating, electric guitar-laden soundtrack plays, while a far-future historian narrates and presents clues as to what happened during humanity's first, ill-fated mission outside the solar system.\n  EXO ONE's story is told partly through the player's strange encounters on the surfaces of each exoplanet, and partly through a future-historian, who delivers smooth voice-over narration interspersed throughout the game.\nOur pilot, flung to an unknown corner of the universe and utterly alone, has only the enigmatic alien structures on the horizon to aim for. Where they lead is up to the player to find out.\nEXO ONE glows red on a frozen world\n\"In the early 21st century, mankind received a signal from a distant point in empty space, light-years from any star. The signal contained plans for an alien craft, which humanity soon built. We called it, 'EXO ONE', 'Exo' meaning 'external' or 'from outside', 'One' referring to the first craft of its kind.\nDuring a regular trial run in a hidden, underground facility, the test-pilot inadvertently triggered a wormhole to open, pulling EXO ONE through to places unknown.\nThe alien technology was so advanced, humanity had barely begun to understand how the craft worked, its full potential and abilities were yet to be charted.\"\n  \"The alien craft appeared to be a marvel of high efficiency, momentum-based transportation. \nThe outer shell was completely frictionless and seemingly impervious to harm, while somehow also highly malleable and able to change form. The craft could transform easily between a sphere and a disc, the former used to traverse the landscape, the latter to glide through the sky and maintain altitude.\nA gravity drive enabled the pilot to shift between high gravity and low gravity. In high gravity mode, the craft becomes incredibly heavy, dropping out of the sky at great speed, or rocketing down hillsides. In low gravity mode, the craft was able to maintain momentum and speed, quickly racing up hillsides and launching off into the sky.\nIn combination, these forms of movement enabled EXO ONE to reach colossal speeds, reach great heights and cover vast areas in little time, and without any discernable power source. \nThese were just the first discoveries of what EXO ONE was able to achieve.\"\n  It's all about the exhilaration of movement. Increase the gravity of EXO ONE to send it rocketing toward the ground, hitting a downslope to build energy before launching off hillsides and soaring into the air and through thunderclouds. \nA simple, yet evocative and mysterious story, told by voice-over narration. Players are left to contemplate strange and perplexing events as they move from planet to planet.\n12 procedurally generated, endless, open alien worlds to traverse. Choose your own path, go in any direction. Landscapes are crafted for their beauty as well as their form, to allow maximum satisfaction of movement.\nA wide array of alien worlds, from terrestrial (desert, sand, rock) to water planets, to gas giants and more. Each has its own unique geology, providing you new, otherworldy playgrounds, with different landforms, atmospheres, skyscapes and other features.\nThe mysterious craft that is EXO ONE. Master the movement, discover its quirks and uncover new abilities as you progress.\nVisually striking graphics, with vivid colors and dense atmospherics puts you right on the surface of space's wildest locations.\nA reverberating, ambient, and electric guitar laden soundtrack by Rhys Lindsay completes the meditative and entrancing experience of EXO ONE.\n  EXO ONE features fully 3D, procedurally generated planets as the star feature of the game. \nEach planet consists of several biomes, mixed together to create subtle, but endless variation. Many planets also contain 'feature' locations that are placed by hand among the procedurally generated terrain.\nHaving worked as a photographer and 3D artist, I've worked on everything from low polygon racing tracks in the 90's to sprite-based characters to VR environments. As an HDRI photographer, I have worked with an 'image based lighting' pipeline, giving me a solid understanding of realistic lighting and physically based shaders.\nProcedurally generated terrain. Game view left, scene view right.\nComing aboard the team is concept artist Tim McBurnie, who has worked at companies such as Blizzard Entertainment, Blur studios, Relic Entertainment, and Wizards of the Coast. Tim will be working with me to flesh out the remaining planets in EXO ONE.\nTim's EXO ONE poster designed for EGX Rezzed\n  Players will journey across 12 separate planets. Each is a new sight to behold, with its own unique set of features, weather, and geology.\nPrepare for terrestrial planets, water worlds, ice worlds, tidally locked planets, gas giants and more!  \nWe've left some room in planning for backer suggested planets, so this is an area we'd feel particularly happy to get backer feedback on!  \nThe completed planets so far are:  \nSagan 4  \nThe snow covered hills and cloud filled skies of Sagan 4\nA gentle and relaxing introduction into the worlds of EXO ONE, Sagan 4 features rolling hills, sweeping mountain faces and thunderclouds lit by a slowly setting sun. Mostly a desolate place, but there are still traces of life to be found...  \nGnowee  \nGnowee, a cold, dark and icy rock with incredibly fast moving clouds.\nOn the opposite end of the color palette, Gnowee is dark, and frozen solid... Winds whip across its surface, driving high speed clouds through the sky, which EXO ONE can surf like waves.     \nEXO ONE wouldn't be complete without its signature, hypnotic, ethereal and reverbing electric guitar soundtrack, written by Rhys Lindsay.\nEach planet features its own custom track to suit its personality and further bring the player into the alien environment.\nPLAY\n\n  While I've worked on the game on my own now for over a year, I've also had help from Rhys Lindsay with the game's soundtrack, and occasionally, with some sanity-saving coding help when I get stuck! \nTim McBurnie is also coming on to help with some planet concepting, and was kind enough to create the Rezzed poster I took to London. With these guys on board, the game development studio is called Exbleative. \nI'll continue as the mostly sole developer, unless the game reaches 2 or 3x the campaign funding goal, in which case I may recruit someone else full or part-time.\nJay Weston -  3D Art, Code, Sound, Story.\nEXO ONE's development is lead by myself. I write code, create the artwork, write the story and produce the sound. I have a 3D art and photography background, and worked as an artist then game designer in a AAA games developer (Ratbag) for 5 years before working as a photographer for over 10 years. I then joined forces with a former work colleague to create the zombie games, Class 3 Outbreak and Zombie Outbreak Simulator. Later, I created my first solo iOS title, Unknown Orbit. EXO ONE is my second (mostly solo) game.\nRhys Lindsay - Musician, Code Consultant\nRhys is crafting the hypnotic soundtrack for EXO ONE. He did the music for Class 3 Outbreak, Zombie Outbreak Simulator and Unknown Orbit, and has been programming in Unity/C# for over 5 years. He will also be helping me with some coding as required. \nIf you like the music in EXO ONE's trailers, check out Rhys' YouTube channel.\nTim Mcburnie - Concept Artist\nTim Mcburnie is a concept designer, illustrator and author based in Australia. He works in the French comic book market as well as animation and video games. His client list includes companies such as Editions Delcourt, Gunfire Games, Ankama, Blur studios, Blizzard Entertainment, and Wizards of the Coast.\nYou can find Tim's amazing work on his website at www.timmcburnie.com\nWhy Kickstarter? \nFull-time work on EXO ONE began early 2016, and since then, all basic systems have been implemented. I've perfected the gravity and gliding movement mechanics, and created numerous planets, including many prototypes and tests. From this point on, what remains is mostly content creation (planets, music, narration, story) and optimization.\nI showcased the game at this year\u2019s EGX Rezzed in London in the Leftfield collection with great success, and prior to that, at Australia's local AVCON Indie Games Room. The version I brought to Rezzed included the game intro, tutorial, first and second planets, complete with voice-over narration and other story elements.\nJay showing EXO ONE at EGX Rezzed, Leftfield\nWe are asking for $35,000 to complete the core game, which includes 10 more planets, a similar number of music tracks, story refinement, concept art, and the voice over narration. \nCost Breakdown\nExo One cost breakdown in AUD $\nStretch Goals\nWe have a number of stretch goals that, if met, will allow EXO ONE to further push the boundaries of representing highly varied, fantastical planets, atmospheres and generally improve quality in all areas. We will be unveiling stretch goals as we approach them, and plan to aim first and foremost for stretch goals that won't push project release dates back too far.\nEXO ONE will be a predominantly digital-only reward campaign. As a mostly 1-man team, and in line with keeping things simple, we've opted to do minimal physical shipping to take as little time away from actual game development as possible. \nWe've tried to provide options, for example the print-it-yourself, high resolution poster files, to fill the physical gap. Most people living in a metro area can get posters printed very cheaply, and we feel this is a decent alternative.\nBacker Preview Build\nCurrently at an early alpha stage, the backer build is included as-is, and is unoptimized. You may encounter bugs, frame rate issues and other problems that make this build unplayable for you, especially if you own an older computer. There are however quality options available to cater for a wider range of computer specs. It contains the intro, tutorial and first two planets. \nYou'll receive this at the end of the campaign in the event of successful funding. \nBacker-Only Polls\nTake part in backer polls during development to help influence things like planet types and other features that will go into the game.\nSoundtrack\nContains 1 song and one song variation per planet, provided in mp3 format.\nBeta Version\nUnlike the above alpha preview build, the beta is a mostly completed game, which requires testing and optimisation before the final game is released.\nPDF Art Book\nI'll will be working with the concept artist, Tim, to come up with the visual appearance of each planet prior to work commencing. This will include work such as thumbnail sketches, color studies and variations, and more detailed work ups, which finally inform the look of the in-game planet and the self-print posters.\nSelf Print Posters\nThis is a digital reward, a JPG file that you will use to print your own EXO ONE poster at home or at your local printer shop. Resolution will allow printing up to A0. We had a lot of positive feedback on the poster at Rezzed and I'm excited to do more!\nStrange Sounds Tier\nI'll work with you to come up with and record either your voice, a message, instrument or generated sound, 3 seconds maximum length. Must be an original recording. \nYou could submit one 3 second clip or a number for me to choose between. Without giving too much away of the story, most of these sounds will appear somewhat randomly, and could be quite heavily distorted.\nNaming Rights Tier\nWork with me to name one of the planets featured in EXO ONE. You choose the planet, and based on its characteristics and theme, we come up with a suitable name. The narrator will speak it's name! Included in the credits are a super special thank you letter for your support at this tier.\nAdd-Ons\nIncrease your pledge by the following amounts to receive these add-ons.\nNote - you must be at least an Early Bird reward tier level to gain access to add-ons. \n$2 each \nDownloadable \"Rezzed\" print-it-yourself poster \nDesktop wallpapers \n$4 each \nSoundtrack \n$7.50 each \n12 self-print posters  \nPDF Artbook\n$10 each \nBeta access (must be EXO ONE tier level or above) \n$16 each \nExtra copy of game \nHow do I get these add-ons, you ask? \nPress the \u201cManage your pledge\u201d button (top right). If you haven\u2019t pledged yet it will say Back this Project. Increase your pledge in the Pledge Amount box by the amount of the add-on/s you would like. For example, say you\u2019re an EXO ONE tier backer ($17), and want the pdf art book (+ $7.50). You\u2019d increase your pledge to $24.50 \nDon\u2019t change the tier you\u2019re pledged at, unless you\u2019d like to do so while on this screen. \nAfter the end of the Kickstarter, you will receive a survey that will ask how you would like your add-on money assigned. \nPlatforms  \nEXO ONE will be initially available on Windows to download on Steam (the game has been Greenlit). Other platforms, including consoles, Mac and Linux will be evaluated after the campaign and game's launch, and most likely in that order. \nPress Kit \nWant to help spread the word about EXO ONE?

I'm fully prepared to do whatever is necessary to reach completion. I wouldn't be asking for your support if I hadn't already invested my own time and money to create a fun and proven game (see the quotes above). With your help, I can begin working towards completion.\n\nSCHEDULE RISK: The most common risk factor in any game. The completion date for Early 2018 is based on my experience having completed numerous planets already, with the core of the game now mostly complete. Should the game take longer than expected to complete, there is a chance that the release date will slip. If I feel this is necessary for the good of the game, I plan to be fully transparent with the reasons behind the decision and will notify backers to explain the situation.\n\nFUN RISK: Having developed numerous prototypes in the past, I'm fully aware sometimes game concepts just aren't as fun as expected. However, having built out and polished the core gameplay loop for EXO ONE over the course of a year, and taken the game to two events locally and overseas, I can safely say gamers thoroughly enjoy playing.\n\nFinally, while I live and work in the small city of Adelaide, I frequently meet and talk with other similarly sized indie developers who have successfully brought games to Steam, and often seek their advice. Furthermore, as a game made with Unity, the huge community of developers is a big help. I am in personal contact with the developers of plugins I'm using, and for anything else, I have the support of experienced developer, Rhys Lindsay among others.\n\nThank you for helping EXO ONE reach its full potential by backing my dream sci-fi, space exploration game!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge AU$ 1 or more", "title": "Remote Viewer", "descp": "Sit back and watch the EXO ONE project unfold with the knowledge you played a part!

On the journey to find justice there are multiple paths and dozens of endings. Will you solve the murder, or stumble into a larger conspiracy at play? Stepping on the wrong toes or turning into the wrong alley could send you to an early grave, and this city's full of em.\n  You'll investigate crime scenes, track perps, and interview witnesses with a number of tools at your disposal, including multiple modes of vision that can expose additional leads and multiple hacking tools for when you log into the GRID-- a vast virtual network where you physically travel through data at blazing speeds to grab encrypted files, hack nodes, meet with clandestine avatars, or even find gateways into the illegal, crime-ridden UnderGRID. \nOn the hunt for the truth, you can completely miss a lead while investigating a scene as you only need one to move the story forward. Often the evidence you can find will give you multiple leads you can investigate next, however time passes which each choice you make and choosing to follow one lead could result in another disappearing. Weather is washing away evidence, people are coming and going inadvertently corrupting clues in their everyday routines, and criminals are cleaning up the trail behind them at the same rate you're making your way forward. \nI believe in order for a player to have a sense of discovery, there has to be the possibility they can miss something completely. That's what truly makes it an adventure- without that you're just on a ride with someone else at the wheel.\nAs for conversations, you'll use Personality Profiles to interview witnesses and suspects in the direct dialog system, where the things you say irrevocably effect your relationship with that person as well as the information they give you, and possibly even what actions they take next. They can lie to you or lead you into a trap if you're not careful with your words. And you only get one shot to get that intel. No info-dumps here.\nYour hard-boiled protagonist's mental state effects the game as well. If there's time, going by Sue's Coffee in the morning will make you more perceptive the rest of that day, and you might be able to find more leads. However, there's a darkness in this detective's past as well, and the cure lies at the bottom of a bottle. If the Chaser doesn't drink for too long, the nightmares come back and interfere with the investigation in detrimental ways. Too much drinking has its obvious drawbacks as well and could draw the ire of Chief. Other vices can be found downtown if you need that extra, not-so-legal perk. Finding a wellness balance is key to staying sharp for this case... or perhaps falling off the deep end is just the edge you need to get things done?\nAs you investigate Sector city you'll be updating your internal database, and even if you reach an early ending (or grave) and start again, the dossiers and other data you've collected will carry over. You're better equipped with the data you need each time you play through, with campaigns lasting anywhere from half an hour to 6 hours. Having late game data early could even unlock new avenues of investigation. So don't be afraid to piss of that gangster- he might tell you something real important before strapping on those cement boots and you'll be able to use it on your next play to get even further down the rabbit hole. Why are you able to recall these things? Who can say, perhaps if you do a bit more digging...\nWith the sometimes lowkey, sometimes uptempo synth heavy music of SectoR I intend to invoke a time and place you've never visited, yet are nostalgic for nonetheless. With enough funding I'm also hoping to licence or even have original music composed by modern musicians leading the way in bringing 'wave music back in fresh new forms.\nBelow are a few early, unfinished samples that should give a good idea of the type and range of music the final product may have.\n  Sector is a world with a rigidly defined class system, so much so that those living on the top floors have different sets of laws than those at the street level, with strictly guarded vertical borders. And when a crime is committed that overlaps these borders, you call a CSR agent.\n   Because Sector is a post-singularity city, 5 tiers of artificial intelligence are used to categorize the different functions and abilities of its robot and computer inhabitants.\n Sector is not only a post-singularity city, its also a post singularity reaction city. On the ashes of a divisive law that made illegal several million self-aware citizens, tensions have never been higher between biological and artificial. Several new industries have escalated in kind, identity alteration and trafficking as these former citizens attempt evade decommission with the help of their neighbors, and in response, bounty hunting and spying from the morally dubious types looking to make a little money, or with the promise of citizenship upgrade. A Chaser agent can't help but get involved, in one way or another.\nTech advances far faster than people are willing or able to adapt, which creates further conflict. Tech progress coinciding with social regress. Cavemen fighting with laser guns. How did it get to this point?\nFollowing an unexpected meteor shower, a mysterious dust appeared in the air all over the world, clouding the atmosphere and killing 70% of all plant life and that which depended on it to live. Radio and satellite signals were unreadable.\nWorldwide chaos.\nBut then, a discovery- this dust could be easily harnessed into a source of power, and seemed to be endless. Rich or poor, power was now everywhere and free. Nations of the world turned inward for a time as a 2nd Renaissance brought forth new technology quicker than ever before in history. Flora was dwindling but food could now be produced artificially. The rain and air was tainted, but most states had purification plants.Most, but not all. Plants couldn\u2019t be built fast enough to prevent a worldwide famine. People were desperate.\nOn the ashes of The War, nations fell and in their place, thousands of micro states, densely populated cities built around essential water resources, formed. One of the larger city states in the Northern Hemisphere is SectoR City. The year is 2026. The world has ended twice in 40 years and been reborn twice.The world will end once more,\nBut until then...\n The Creator\n I'm Ryan Hall, formerly an animator at OffBase productions. While there did contract modeling, rigging, and animation work related to such marquee titles as Dark Souls 3, Naruto Ultimate Ninja Storm 4, Star Ocean: Integrity and Faithlessness, and Dragonball Xenoverse 2 in addition to some VR stuff I'm not at liberty to discuss in detail. \nLater once my contract ended I began work on an updated show reel and had the idea for a futurist city that could act as the connective gateway for my portfolio pieces. But the more I worked on it, the more I realized this could be the genesis of a more ambitious idea; that eventually became the Kickstarter I've shared with you today. \nWhile I am doing just about everything solo, Id be remiss not to thank a few groups that helped pick up the programming slack. Thanks so much to Panda Studios and Heads&Brains for the use of their code in that regard. And of course, none of it would be possible without Unreal Engine 4, and big thanks to the fine folks constantly tweaking it at Epic Games for making something user-friendly enough for a right brain type of guy like me to throw a demo together.\nBacker Rewards\n   ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nBeing the sole creative drive for a game is a double edged sword, but enough people in the last decade have shown it can be a successful endeavor and often creates a game that feels unique in a way a large team game tends not to.\n\nAdditionally, with middle-ware development kits like Unreal 4 as well as marketplace blueprints and plugins, which were developed by teams of professional programmers and experts, you're never truly making a game on your own. And they'll be picking up the mechanical slack here while I focus on the rest; visuals, storytelling, modeling, rigging, texturing, animation, sound, music, etc., all the competencies of which can be assessed in the demo I've provided.\n\nMost of the game's story and visuals have already been mapped out, as you can see in some of the pre-rendered cut scenes; its just a matter of being able to put the time in to get this stuff running in UE4, and that just leaves covering expenses along the way.\n\nBranching off from a big Bay Area company and doing your own thing is a risk, but it avails you of risk-averse politics.

We\u2019re very much interested to release Unformed for portable devices (PSVita / 3DS) and Nintendo Switch eventually after the game is out for main platforms, but this is not set in stone.\nCurse Devices System \nCharacter development in Unformed works with help of unique Raw Stones - Curse Devices system; it\u2019s a complex system that was inspired by Sphere Grid system from Final Fantasy X and Equipment Skill system from Monster Hunter series. In order to become more powerful, players will have to upgrade variety of curse devices with raw stones, finding those through variety of tasks on their journey through Dvipa. If done correctly, the link between curse devices will strongly increase the power of both curse devices and raw stones inside them. Players will be able to acquire raw stones randomly throughout the game and will be able to improve their quality by upgrade and synthesis process. Curse devices are widely spread across every corner of both planes; players will have to explore locations and complete various tasks to get curse devices of the rarest quality.\nExploration / World \nUnformed will offer players a large number of distinct level settings. From underground mines to mountain salt lakes, locations not only look different, they each have unique gameplay features. These include but are not limited to:\nDynamically changing levels\nForeground and background binding \nMirror principle Illusions \nPuzzle solving by changing level structure.\nCombat \nUnlike the majority of 2D action games, the combat system in Unformed is very challenging, heavily inspired by Dark Soul and other games in the Souls series. Creatures attack in an unpredictable manner, making players think several steps ahead of every engagement in order to overcome their foes. Should they fail, they\u2019ll have to start back from the checkpoint. Even though Unformed isn\u2019t a reenactment of Souls games in 2D form, our designers are fans of the series and took inspiration of the combat style inherent to it. Take every fight seriously, carefully balancing between aggression and stamina. Use various magic spells, karma-infused weapons and enchantment to overcome the toughest of foes or to cop out of a bad situation.\nTeam Overview \nUnformed is being developed by Blackfire Games. Core members of our studio have years of international experience in the development of AAA games, have been involved in the design and production of a variety of Console/PC/iOS/Android games and have ported and localized many well-known titles, such as Rainbow Six, Rayman, Bioshock, FarCry, XCOM, etc.\nQuests \nPlayers will be able to acquire quests from NPCs; these quests may result in changing the game world or provide interesting fluff pieces of the world of Unformed. Some quests will have branching storylines; players will have to replay the game several times to fully experience sidequest's storylines. Unformed will consist of about 8 -10 secondary story arcs in addition to the main quest.\nWithout YOU, our dream will undoubtably be dashed on the jagged rocks of reality. Help us to create Unformed and we all will have a shot at living forever. We are all in this journey together and we promise to hold you tight the entire way (but not TOO tight).\nIf, by the will of the gods, we somehow achieve immortality and reach our goal, there is the possibility of an even greater treasure beyond the $20,000 mark! Vast amounts of glory and pleasure await backers with our Stretch Goals.\nSurely we will all live in bliss if the first goal of $30,000 is met. Once unlocked, the first Stretch Goal will enable backers to explore the expanded world of Unformed with an enlarged map, unveiling new levels and areas to make your mark upon.\nEternal glory will fall upon each head that contributes to the second Stretch Goal! Once the mere $50,000 mark is unlocked, flesh and bone will meld together to produce a new hero with whom players can control. While on the same level as our heroine, this new hero will possess different abilities and skills the likes of which have never been seen! Become accustomed to him! Control him! Additionally, players will experience the aesthetic power of more beautifully illustrated and animated scenes within Unformed!\nHelp us unlock both Stretch Goals and we will all reap the benefits and bounty that awaits! We are truly grateful to each of you for walking hand-in-hand with us down this long and perilous road.\n                   ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe\u2019re 100% confident that we can finish this game, but as we\u2019ve yet to become immortal, there are always risks. We promise you that we will do whatever we can to nail down all the problems. All of the money accrued will let us cover development costs, such as paying salary to our development team (we do have to buy groceries and pay rent with something), acquiring equipment and such. But because our staff is made of up angels and saints, we would be remiss if we didn\u2019t recommend that you back Unformed at your own comfortable level (if you don't want to donate, just spare a word. That will also help us tremendously!) To be brutally honest, we seriously need your help! We don\u2019t want this campaign to become another Kickstarter failure, so we hope we can generate and share huge-ass smiles of glee with everyone who helped us from now until the day we unleash Unformed out into the world.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Blackfire Games\nFirst created \u00b7 0 backed\nBlackfire Games is committed to creating new original IP.

The entire game focuses on survival and exploration gameplay in a hand painted watercolor world created from the memories of Grinny's victims.\nSoul\u2019s Light is inside all of us. It is the driving force that keeps us moving. It\u2019s also a source of power that Mr. Grinny seeks to steal so that he can enter our world. In the game, all Soul\u2019s Light is hidden in items of meaning to the characters. You must find these items to collect enough light to defeat Mr. Grinny. \n     During my childhood, I was often plagued by the same nightmare. A shadowed creature with a hideous sharp-toothed grin would come to my room at night. I would throw my sheets over my head or hide under the bed, but he would always find me and flash that hideous grin, as his long sharp claws grasped me.\nI began to call him Mr. Grinny. \n As I grew up, I forgot about him and the nightmares stopped, but he was still lurking around deep in my subconscious. As an adult, I learned that my nightmares as a kid were actually sleep paralysis and that many other people experiencing it also see a shadowed figure, shadow people, or a man in a hat. Mr. Grinny floated to the top of my memories, and an idea began to form in my mind. \nNow I can share with the world the terror of Mr. Grinny...\nSoul\u2019s Light is all about Exploration and Survival. Gameplay is kept simple so you are drawn into the game's characters and story. You can harness the power of your Soul\u2019s Light to distract and in some cases destroy shadow creatures if they are not too powerful. As you use your Soul\u2019s Light, the world becomes less saturated as your light dwindles. You must find Soul Light orbs before it goes out for good. During the game, you will come across other lost souls searching for their Soul\u2019s Light, who you will join to take a final stand against Mr. Grinny.\nHand Painted 2D watercolor world.\n5 different Locations to Explore and discover their secrets.\nSurvival style gameplay, with classic platforming elements.\nShadow Creatures whose only goal is to find and destroy you.\nAn engaging story with an emotional core. \nQuirky characters you meet along the way that need your help. \nRandom Game Over animations that change with every death.\n       I have spent the last 10 years working in the animation industry as an animator and producer. 4 years ago I started to learn game development, and became hooked. I started Soul\u2019s Light 2 years ago by writing the story and fleshing out the character of Mr. Grinny. I created a 360 short introducing Mr. Grinny last year using Unity3D.\n               Use Google Chrome, Android, or iOS to watch in 360.\nI\u2019m leaning on my vast experience as a visual artist and storyteller to create a vivid world that will fill you with dread, but also compassion, courage, and ultimately forgiveness in yourself. I love to tell stories with emotional depth, and I wanted to cross that over into the video game world for a more visceral interactive experience. \nWatercolors are used to create the assets and levels for Soul\u2019s Light by hand. All animation is hand drawn and then painted before being added to the game engine Unity3D. This makes the world feel like a watercolor painting that has come to life. It also creates an impressionistic look to the game unlike anything before.\n               PC, MAC, LINUX\nI have been working Soul\u2019s Light for 2 years. The characters and story have been developed, and I have the main game functionality and mechanics running in the prototype. This Kickstarter is to allow me to move into production with the watercolor art assets for the different levels of the game, be able to have help on Unity3D coding, painting, and animation. \nWith your help, we can make Mr. Grinny\u2019s world come to life!\n   ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe biggest risk is that this is my first game. Because of this, I made the conscious decision to keep the scope and gameplay of Soul\u2019s Light very simple. By doing this, I\u2019m confident in my ability to create a game where I can use my 10+ years experience as an Animator, Storyteller, and Producer. During that time I have delivered more than 40 projects, including Commercials, TV Shows, and Animated Feature Films.\n\n I didn\u2019t jump into this campaign lightly. I have used my production experience to make a solid schedule and budget that I have been following. Soul\u2019s Light has 2 years of development, so there is a strong foundation for this game to sit on, along with the support structure I have to help me get to the finish line. \n\nI decided to start this Kickstarter at this point in development to help the game through the rest of production, polishing, QC, and the final release. In my entire 10-year career I have delivered all projects on schedule without quality suffering. While timelines can shift due to unforeseen circumstances, I am dead set on releasing a quality game in September of 2018.

If you manage to survive its inhabitants, your skills will be challenged by the enormous and fierce creatures that rule this damned universe.\n  Explore a huge land, a universe that feels as open as it is oppressive, delivered through a non-sequential level design that puts you in control of where to go next.\nWe are putting great focus on achieving a very satisfying combat mechanics with very responsive control, smooth animations and lots of blood and gore.\nHandmade pixel art, with large sprites and super smooth animations, created pixel by pixel, frame by frame.\nEvocative narrative: Blasphemous\u2019 levels are not just platforms; they tell a story to those who are interested, but don't get in the way if you just want the action.\nFind your personal combat style by equipping rosary beads, or carrying around relics that boost your abilities.\n  Inventory and player progression\n      We\u2019re proud to announce that we have teamed up with a very experienced development partner to be able to release the game simultaneously on all these platforms!\nSet in the savage land of Orthodoxia, a place where religion is of the utmost importance in the eyes of the populace, superstition runs amok, and churches outnumber people two to one. You will find yourself in this hellish territory in the wake of the Age of Corruption.\n...The High Pontiff was entirely transformed into a great, withered and barren tree and burned for ninety days and ninety nights...\n...Riddled with frustration at their insufficient devotion, The High Pontiff heaved his golden throne with and turned the entire throne back. Years passed and all of a sudden it appeared something was beginning to change in the state of the High Pontiff. Dried out, dying branches began to emerge from the ends of his fingers and slowly started growing out from all over his pallid, immobile body. The High Pontiff was transformed into a great, withered and barren tree and began to burn for ninety days and ninety nights...\n...A huge mountain of ash stood in its place, topped by the infamous turned throne, unoccupied and unguarded...\n...Once the tree had been entirely consumed by the flames, a huge mountain of ash stood in its place, topped by the infamous turned throne, unoccupied and unguarded. The remaining church leadership scrambled upwards to reach the top and assume the throne. But the mountain begin to shift beneath their feet and before long the mountain of ash had swallowed up each and every soul who had been present in the Cathedral. From the ashes rose those poor unfortunate souls who had been swallowed up, transformed into horrible, deformed and bloodthirsty beasts, wildly aggressive and violent in nature, but with their faith intact...  \n  In Blasphemous, you will play as The Penitent One, a rogue nomad tackling the evil of this world alone with only its trusty sword by their side.\nThe Penitent One is the last survivor of a congregation called The Silent Sorrow. The whole group was punished to be thrown to the great Abyss of the Eternal Grief.\nHere you will see some of the horrific and inhuman enemies our pixel artists came up with over the last few months. More scarier and larger creatures will follow soon!\nAcolyte\n  Flagellant\n  Sister of the Our Lady of the Burnt Face\n    Weight of her burden\n  Condemned\n  Processioner\n    The Penitent One\n      Procession of Flagellants, 1793 - Francisco Goya\nIn Blasphemous, we\u2019ve set ourselves an artistic challenge: Can we create a dark fantasy world that is universally appealing, but also deeply inspired by the most meaningful icons of our local folklore? If you play Blasphemous, chances are that you may want to visit the city of Seville (Spain) in the future, to see the locations, traditions and culture that inspired the game.\nSkyline of the city of Seville (Spain)\n  We are lucky to have Carlos Viola\u2019s mastery on board. He's the award-winning composer of 'The Last Door', and other remarkable indie titles like 'Pharaonic' (by Milkstone), 'Six sides of the world' and 'Rotor'scope'.\nThis time around, he will be directing the work on both the Original Soundtrack and the audio design.\nListen to the first theme of the soundtrack:\nIf you don\u2019t know the works of Carlos Viola, we recommend you start by checking out his amazing work for \u2018The Last Door\u2019, available on Spotify.\n  We\u2019re a tiny development studio that focuses on creating meaningful playable experiences. We proudly specialize in delivering great games, despite operating with scarce resources. Maybe, you've heard about our previous work, a playable homage to classic horror writers (Lovecraft, Poe, & Machen):\n'The Last Door' is an award winning point and click horror adventure. It\u2019s a series of 8 playable episodes, developed using crowdfunding between 2013 and 2016. Initially, they were launched for browsers, but now you can enjoy them in their Collector\u2019s Editions for PC, iOS, Android and Windows Phone.\nOur previous title, \u2018The Last Door\u2019, was developed together with its community, with frequent discussion, beta builds, and incorporating community feedback in every possible way. For \u2018Blasphemous\u2019 we want to take this concept even further.\nWe offer our backers several levels of involvement with the project\u2019s development:\nThe Penitent (20 $) an up: We love transparency! Any pledge that includes the game will give you access to frequent development updates.\nThe Follower (25 $) and up: This pledge will grant access to a private development forum, where you will be frequently asked for feedback, participate in polls and help us with decision-making, plus access to the game's beta.\nThe Disciple (40 $), The Immortal (200 $) and up: you\u2019ll get access to our private channels on Slack/Discord, where all the design discussions will take place, one-on-one conversation with the development team, enjoy monthly (unfinished) builds and all future prototypes of the game.\n      The work on Blasphemous started in November 2016. The first stages involved the creation of the first bunch of concept art, to explore the artistic themes we wanted the game to feature. We\u2019ve been working non-stop since then, and indeed completed some key milestones along the way.\nWe are now preparing to switch from pre-production to production, and that\u2019s when we need you on board!\nWe\u2019re currently prototyping the second layer of gameplay, involving narrative and exploration mechanics. We're in the process of measuring the production scope and testing every required production pipeline. After that, we will confidently enter the production stage!\nFrom there, we have laid out a roadmap of frequent milestones (please note these dates are subject to change, although we are confident in our production dates):\nJune. 2017 - Aesthetics prototype (If the campaign succeeds, available for all backers, for Win/Mac/Linux!)\nSep. 2017 - Win/Mac/Linux Narrative prototype (The Disciple pledge or above required).\nNov. 2017 - Win/Mac/Linux Player\u2019s progression prototype (The Disciple pledge or above required).\nQ2, 2018 - Win/Mac/Linux Alpha (The Disciple pledge or above required).\nQ3, 2018 - Win/Mac/Linux Beta (The Follower pledge or above required).\nQ1, 2019 - All Platforms Global launch.\n                      So far, this project has been completely fueled by our own money. Bringing the game to Kickstarter now will enable us to get the extra funds we need to fully realize our artistic goals while retaining full creative control. For us, and particularly for Blasphemous, this is critical because of the potentially controversial topics we are featuring in the game.\nAt the same time, it creates a community around the game we can rely on to make the game truly awesome! While creating our previous game \u2018The Last Door\u2019, we experimented with opening the development process to the community. It was not only the most amazing experience, but it also helped the game become really extraordinary, reaching quality standards that we never hoped to achieve on our own, thanks to the collective intelligence.\nLet's make another game together!\nEngage the developers in our DISCORD server\nFollow us on Twitter:\n@BlasphemousGame\nFollow us on Fadebook:\nFacebook.com/BlasphemousGame\nOfficial website\nPresskit()\n This project is promoted by Jellop, a direct response online advertising agency specializing in Kickstarter campaigns on Facebook Ads and Google AdWords.\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhen you are about to embark on any project there will always be a certain amount of trepidation. You can list all of the \u2018What ifs\u2019 until you\u2019re blue in the face. There is a long road ahead of us from our current development stage to our final product release and it would be foolish to assume it will all be smooth sailing. However, we are experienced developers, having successfully steered a three-year development project right before this one, so we feel confident we will know how to manage the unexpected.\n\nSome of the areas of expertise required for this project are beyond our skill set, particularly the ones related to porting the game to consoles, and the ones related to marketing. We will seek strategic partners to go where we cannot go on our own. \n\nFinally it\u2019s worth mentioning that due to the controversial and mature nature of some of the themes and visuals, we may have to prepare ourselves to fight a couple of battles against censorship, political correctness or etiquette here and there, but we\u2019re confident that if we have the support of you backers, we will be able to manage it in a way that it is satisfactory to most parties.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "The Thankful", "descp": "Not sure if you'd want the game, but you still want to give a hand to the developers, be kept in the loop and receive the backer-exclusive campaign updates.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2017"}], "stat": ["283 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 15 or more", "title": "The Penitent - EARLY BIRD", "descp": "Be among the first backers to receive a 33% discount on The Penitent reward tier!\nINCLUDES:\nDigital download (Steam or GoG/DRM-free) for Win, Mac & Linux\nInstructions on PDF\nWelcome kit: wallpapers, ringtones and other digital goodies", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2018"}], "stat": ["499 backers", "Limited (1 left of 500)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 20 or more", "title": "The Penitent", "descp": "Get 'Blasphemous' the game when it's done!\nINCLUDES:\nDigital download (Steam or GoG/DRM-free) for Win, Mac & Linux\nInstructions on PDF\nWelcome kit: wallpapers, ringtones and other digital goodies", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2018"}], "stat": ["2,146 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 25 or more", "title": "The Follower", "descp": "Get the soundtrack, access to the Beta and have a significant impact in the game's final form by participating in development discussions and polls.

Or just do nothing when facing evil?\nTrauma \nIntense stress and guilt will impact your heroes. \nNo one knows how they will react when pushed to the edge. Bursts of anger, depressions or betrayals: everything is possible. Try to keep them alive and sane...\nReplay value\nDepending on the choices you make, some situations will or will not happen further in the game. Play it several times to discover them.\nPlus, an additional Story + mode will make the adventure even more unpredictable. \n    My name is Thierry and I\u2019m an independent gamedev from Brussels, Belgium.   \nAfter my studies in Corporate Communications -Yes, I know. Please don\u2019t judge me- I decided to follow my dreams and start creating games. I learned to program and to draw -or at least I pretend I have- and started working full time on The Man Came Around.  \nSo, instead of telling you to buy useless stuff, I\u2019m telling you to buy entertaining stuff made by my tiny hands. Hooray!  \nI\u2019m also an incorrigible leftist.\nOne year and a half ago, as I started working on this game - a simple plane crash story then called To the Sky- I asked myself what I could to do to make the world a better place. \nI decided to use my games to relay progressive values and express some of my frustrations about the system. \nDon't get me wrong, I like explosions and stuff in games, but more variety cannot be a bad thing. All movies are not action movies, are they ? And if a game talking about politics and social issues can impact only one person positively, it\u2019s definitely worth a shot. \nSince I made that decision, a lot of things happened. 2015 and 2016 were pretty f****d up.  Scandals, protests, bombings - sometimes close to home -, elections\u2026 Some made the game looks more like a documentary than a dystopian fiction.\nSo Pipette Inc., my studio, will only produce games containing a meaningful critique of society.  It\u2019s not just about The Man Came Around, but the entire studio\u2019s philosophy. So here's my whislist for our poor world and the values that Pipette Inc will defend and promote : \nLet\u2019s stop discriminating people based on their race, gender or sexuality. And I\u2019m a cis white male, so to all my counterparts around the world : stop being douchebags.\nSociety should work for all of us, not just a greedy minority. Life is not about productivity and money. You also need to have the time to play games.\nI don\u2019t want polar bears to die. Oh, and no climate wars, droughts, floods, massive pollution and the end of the world either. Climate change is real. Deal with it! \nWe should always fight fascists. Insert a whiny \u00ab Aren\u2019t you a fascist because you want to beat fascists, you fascist ? \u00bb comment here. Well, sorry alt-right nazis, but \u201cWe don\u2019t like your kind here.\u201d \n\n   \nI've been working full time on The Man Came Around for a year and a half now. I learned a lot in the process, and I\u2019m finally sure to have all the tools and abilities I need to finish the game. Which is why I dare bring this project to kickstarter.\nAs you know, an artist doesn\u2019t live from just love and fresh water. We also need some dry bread, a cardboard house and a wifi connection. I\u2019m currently financing the game with my savings and the support of my family, but I need a little help in order to make the game better and replenish my pasta stock. \nAnd since The Man Came Around criticizes a lot the political corruption and the neoliberal greed, chances I\u2019ll get money from a bank or my right-winged government are \u2026 hem\u2026 pretty slim. \nSo I prefer to ask progressives from around the world to back the project, if the idea of a studio producing entertaining and committed games appeals to them. Call me a crazy socialist, an anarchist or a fool, but that\u2019s the way I roll! \nI\u2019m asking for ten thousand euros. It\u2019s a lot, and at the same time, it\u2019s not. To be honest, making games cost a lot of money, especially if you want to pay talented people to work and eat pastas with you.\nThe developmental cost of the game is much higher than what I ask here. The budget of an independent game can vary a lot, but it varies between 50 and 100K. So, I\u2019ll combine the Kickstarter money with my own savings to make it work.\nThe initial ten thousand will serve to pay :\nThe sound and music of the game \nMy food and my rent (let\u2019s be honest)  \nAnother starving 2D/3D artist to help me\nAny stretch goals attained will help me make the game better and finish it faster. Mainly be hiring talented people to help me improve some parts of the game.\nHere are some graphics to explain the whole thing. Everybody loves graphics! (Damn you, marketing :'( )\n    Some concepts and production processes from The Man Came Around. Thank you to Mary for her work on the HUD and some levels of the game, and to No\u00e9 for the concepts!\n         Poster, Artbook and T Shirt etc.\nI don't need to really explain those ones, so FEAST YOUR EYES ON THE MAGIC.\nThe Artbook, Poster and T Shirt. Also known as THE DREAM, people!\nThe Many's Manual for Revolution vol. I\nA booklet wrote by the activist organization known as \"The Many\" to oppose their corrupt government and greedy corporations. The manual is filled with good advices to protest and challenge the oligarchy. And also with dank memes.\n  The Man Came Around Boardgame prototype\nPlay The Man Came Around with friends with this experimental and yet highly promising version of the boardgame. Playable from 3 to 6 players, TMCA the Boardgame is a semi-cooperative adventure where your group has find a way trough the murderous borders and face multiples dangers.\nBy taking all those decisions almost democratically.\nIndeed, players can use card to influence votes, steal objects or just send someone else to a probable death...So, what will you do when the food runs scarce and Walt spent the whole game backstabing you?\nSometimes, you need to save your own ass. No hard feelings, Walt!\n    Tables of rewards\n       ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\n- Create a game\n\n\nCreating a game alone is quite the hurdle. So, how can I be sure I\u2019m gonna make it? \n\nWell, first of all, I\u2019m passionate and motivated. It sounds like a bad cover letter, but it\u2019s true!\n\nSecond, I\u2019m not truly alone. I have the chance of having great friends helping me on the project. And to be part of small-but-thriving belgian indie game scene, with a lot of great artists and coders always ready to share their knowledge\n\nThird, I spent a lot of time on the pre-production phase to be ABSOLUTELY certain I would be able to finish the game. Now it\u2019s just a question of time, and ability to live afterwards without being super-hyper-mega broke. \n\nDon't hate monday folks, hate capitalism.\n\n\n- Create a political game\n\n\nDoing anything political is risky, especially in video games. The internet is vast and full of trolls. But I don\u2019t really mind what alt-right nazis will think of me, so if you don\u2019t like the project, too bad!\n\nAnd If you do like it, then thank you.

You\u2019ll take control of the almighty ship Chukaru and its three unique weapons! Shoot wisely to either do double damage, heal yourself or charge your Super Attack! Inspired by the classics of the Dreamcast era, the Manufacture 43 team is making bold choices to modernize the genre and pushing it further while staying true to the legacy of games like Ikaruga or Zero Gunner.\nThis game is offering will offering an experience that will please newcomers with instant fun and challenge experienced players with a deep mechanic and tightly crafted level design.\nDiscover more details about our game below, and help push the limits of the genre by supporting us!\nPLATFORMS\nAs we are going to release for PC Mac and Linux first , we are currently doing everything possible to release on console as well. We already started the procedure to get Xbox One devkits and that should not be an issue. PS4 and Switch ones are a bit more complicated to obtain but with your support we can make it happen more easily.\nWe will keep you updated on this !\nupdate: Pawarumi will now be available for xbox one.\n  Join us on Discord all along the campaign and beyond !\n\nOur Greenlight campaign was validated in less than a week. Because of that we didn't have much time to interact with you! we are now opening a free to join Discord server to bring Pawarumi community in one place. We want to have a straight relationship with our players to get suggestions and feedback directly from you.\n\nFrom now on we will hang out on the server, so we can answer any questions you might have about Pawarumi !\nWe want this platform to be a place of love for shoot em up and arcade games in general.\n      Pawarumi is inspired by arcade legendary shoot\u2019em ups as well as Dreamcast\u2019s classic. And like every other shooter you\u2019ve got a full set of weapons with different characteristics. \n\nAll of them are mapped to a different input and are available at all time with unlimited ammunition so you can rain divine fire on your enemies !\nThe green weapon, known as Serpent Gatling got a large scope as close range and get more precise at long distance.\nFor example ,this allows you to kill a lot of small ennemies from upclose or do tons of damages on a single enemy if you anticipate it\u2019s movements enough.\nThe red weapon or Jaguar Missiles is an auto-locking one. Every enemy crossing the target area will receive a terrible blast, but be mindful of the range limitations because the missiles will loose target acquisition.  \nThe blue weapon also called Condor Laser is a concentrated beam of pure energy that does continuous damage and go through everything in a straight line. You will have to be precise with your placement to be fully effective and deadly.\nTHE TRINITY SYSTEM\n\nIn Pawarumi, the gameplay loop is centered around the Trinity System, which adds a tactical layer to the overall experience. Each facet of the system is triggered simply by shooting with the appropriate weapon on the right type of enemy.\nIt's a bit like a super rock-paper-scissors where every combination is beneficial to you.\n\nThe wheel of the Trinity below shows the different relation between the player weapons in the center and the enemies type on the outside.\nCRUSH to inflict double damage.  \nFor example shoot with the red weapon to crush blue enemies.\n\nBOOST to heal your shield while also making your opponents more agressive.\nFor example shoot green enemies with the green weapon. They both use the same energy and so you're both powered up ! \n\nDRAIN to charge your Super Attack! It will wipe the screen of most of your opponents.\nFor example shoot red enemies with the blue weapon and charge up your supper attack so you can unleash it several times in a level. \nMastering these three mechanics will be key to success in Pawarumi. It offers a lot of strategic opportunities and allows you to fall back on your feet even if you make a tiny mistake.\n\nThe more you'll play , the better you'll juggle with the weapons to find your own style, finish the game and eventually reach the top of the leaderboard !\nSCORING\n\nThe scoring is based on 3 types of points : Destruction, Charge and Combo. Each one is tied to one of facet of the trinity mechanic. \nCrushing will give you Destruction bonus points when you kill an enemy using a Crush\n\nDraining will grant you Charge bonus points and Boosting will grant you a bit more of them.\n\nCombo is the super attack scoring modifier. Each tic of every single bullet you shoot will add a number to the combo meter. At the end of the super attack you'll be granted with all the points corresponding to the damage you've done multiplied by the combo score ! \nMaximizing usage of all three mechanics throughout the game will lead you to the top of the leaderboard! \nFor example you can leech on a strong enemy with a Boost (and so facing a stronger foe) and finish him with a Crush to maximise the score ! \nBOSSES\nTroughout your journey you will encounter massive bosses. Each boss will offer a unique & intense experience and we crafted all of them to give you the challenge you craving for.\nYou will have to learn how to dodge their patterns and find your own strategy to defeat them.\nLet\u2019s meet the cast of Pawarumi\u2019s most dangerous foes :\n            You will live through the journey of Axo the godsend warrior. In this adventure she will travel the world fighting for the fate of humanity.\n\nOn Earth, in another universe, the Spanish invasions that decimated the pre-columbian civilizations never happened. Those civilizations then flourished, evolved exponentially and soon conquered the rest of the world with their technological superiority and their divine powers. Las, not unlike in our world, the omnipotent members of the Council that ruled the world became corrupt and the civilization was being drown into decay.\n\nThen came Axo, pilot of Chukaru, chosen by the gods to bring balance but also driven by anger against the Council for leading the world into chaos.\nPawarumi is her story, her legend. Live through her fight and discover the truth behind her actions.\n   \nUnique Artistic Direction: Set in a unique pre-columbian inspired retrofuturistic sci-fi universe and served by 3D graphics that give opportunity for glorious cinematic staging! \nFive Unique Levels: Happening in different parts of the world and inspired by classics from the 1990s and 2000s pop culture, like Indiana Jones, James Bond, Stargate or Star Wars\u2026 \nCrafted for replayability: Each level has a particular gameplay twist that will slightly change the way you look at the game. Study every possible options to reach the end of the game your own way! \n\nTrinity Game Mechanic: Three fused mechanics that enable infinite strategies! \n\nMany different enemies : And by many we mean a LOT ! Each with different patterns to dodge or behaviour to learn ! \nWeapon Mastery Scoring System: Build up your own scoring strategy with careful weapon juggling. With no long standing combos to maintain, scorers will never be frustrated! Are you ready to challenge the top of the leaderboard ?\nDynamic Layered Music: Awesome Electro Metal Peruvian soundtrack carefully crafted by our man Gregory Desmurs. You can be sure that you never heard anything like this!

Through the years, we forged a solid knowledge of game development and decided that it was time to make our own thing.\n\nLet's meet the team !\n      The sound and music of shoot'em ups helped define the basics of today's video games sound design. Like with every aspect of Pawarumi, we wanted something respeting that legacy as well as bringing something else to the genre.\n      Today Kickstarter is a milestone and a tool for us. It offers us an opportunity to get a strong support from the players and our community, while giving you access to our behind the scene and key informations about our journey. By doing this campaign, we are bringing you exclusive rewards that will not be accessible ever again.\nCheck it out !\n  REWARDS DETAIL \n\nThe digital copies of Pawarumi will be sent by email on release date. The physical elements will come a few weeks later depending on your location.\nThose of you that took the Raging Pilot pledge will also have access to a digital manual telling a bit more about the universe of Pawarumi and giving some gameplay tips and tricks to help you reach the top of the leaderboard faster!\nWe love game boxes! Our shelves are crowded with all kinds of them, from cartridge to CDs, collector editions of all sizes, and we\u2019re proud of our collections! We know that we\u2019re not alone in this case, that\u2019s why we are proposing a physical edition of Pawarumi to people who took the Born Legend pledge. It was important to us! And we want it to look awesome next to your other games! \nNot final design.\nFor people that will took the Knight of Xibalba pledge or higher we will send you regular exclusive beta build of the game! Test it and give us feedbacks on discord!\nThe collector edition of Pawarumi will contain exclusive ex-libris cards, as well as cool stickers to decorate your gear or just to collect!\nOver the Legendary Trainer pledge you\u2019ll get a kickass tshirt to show the world your love of shoot\u2019em ups and Pawarumi and show off with with friends !\nWe love figurines as well, even if our girlfriends don\u2019t ! The 3d printed version of Chukaru will be a beautiful asset and will be a collector piece that will stand proudly next to your other awesome dust gathering toys :)\n\nupdate: new exclusive in-game skin for all backers.\nExclusive backer golden skin\n    Pawarumi's development started in January 2016. At this time, the goal was to make a small shoot'em up with minimal risks and a very classic gameplay. This developement intention was safe but after a few prototypes we found out that the game could be more challenging and creative.\nThe goal of our journey as indie developers was to create content that will bring something new to players. We decided to create a game that will push the genre further as well as bringing a fresh experience to players that played shoot'em up or used to play them.\nThe Trinity System was created from this motivation. It is bringing more to the genre by adding a tactical layer to the standard shooter. We also get rid off additional lives, powerups and focus the user experience on player skill improvement only, as some modern games like the DarkSouls series tends to do. And player feedbacks were amazing.\n\nWe decided that the meso-american setting will give Pawarumi a unique identity. Mayan and Aztec culture, with their unique architecture style, mythologies and art are giving us a really good starting point for our visuals. Mixing this with 80s and 90s aesthetics allowed us to go bananas on the universe and create something that feels unique with a tiny bit of our teenagehood inside.\nFor the past year we have been developing Pawarumi. We are now around 70% of project completion. All the gameplay is well implemented and the scoring system is complete even if we are still tweaking it. Three out of the final five levels are complete and a fourth one is currently in production and should be done during this campaign. The fifth one is going to be quite different from the other ones but we will tell more about this later.\nThe release date is planned for May. And all five levels will be there at launch. Extra content is going to be added freely via updates. You can expect more game modes and better story development, and maybe ideas that will emerge from exchanges with our community on Discord.\n    Pawarumi is our first project as indie game developers. Making a game is a long and difficult process.\nOur initial plan was to publish by ourselves the best game possible in the short time allowed by our resources. The three of us left the industry to start this journey fulltime, being funded only by our savings.\n\nPawarumi was born from our envy to push the genre further. It does bring its original look, feel and mechanics that offer a lot of varieties in terms of level design, gameplay and replayability. We now need support from creatives to bring the final touches to some aspects of the game.\nWe also need support from the community to give Pawarumi the final impulse to bring it to its final release and even push it further. Coming to kickstarter is also a step toward the community that supported us for the past year and bring them physical rewards.\nBy backing this project you will take part of this journey.\nWe are now looking for 15000\u20ac, it corresponds to our needs to finish the game. funds raised by this campaign will be used for specifics purposes:\nPaying outside contractors - we needs an illustrator for in game and out game artworks, a narrative designer to bring Pawarumi characters to life. Add more music in the game.\nCovering company costs - Publishing a game is not just about coding and modeling. Your support will help us covering our company fees and have access to development software and hardware that we need. \nImproving and fixing - We need time to bring the game to a polish state. Your support will help us in those final moments. we would be able to push features up and bring to you a bug-free game.\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAfter a year of development, Pawarumi is almost done, we just need few months of work to finish it. Our objectives are now simple: make the best game we can with our ressources and release the game. \nBut these ressources being our savings, we're now running low of them. Without this Kickstarter we will have trouble paying for the creative people we want to hire to make the game better.\n\nThe three of us have a cumulative experience of more than 20 years. For Pawarumi we capitalize on this experience to break any wall coming at us. We already have passed some key moments: closed alpha test, journalists reviews, showcasing in multiples festivals and creating the company. The most important left is to finish the game in time for the release in May and for that, you can count on us to work even harder.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u20ac1 or more", "title": "Young warrior", "descp": "Manufacture 43 team will be forever grateful of your bidding.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2017"}], "stat": ["16 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac17 or more", "title": "Chukaru's Master", "descp": "Get a digital copy of Pawarumi!

Yet, it is the only way to reach a world long-forgotten by time. Will you heed the call of adventure and face the challenges that await within?\"\nTangledeep is an upcoming turn-based, dungeon crawling, roguelike RPG for PC, OSX and Linux. Its gorgeous 16-bit aesthetic is inspired by some of the most classic RPGs of the SNES era, such as Secret of Mana and Chrono Trigger, while its deep and strategic gameplay combines elements of modern titles like Diablo and Rogue Legacy.\nLike what you see? Play the game yourself! We've been releasing public builds for 6 months now and lots of people are already playing and enjoying the game, even in its pre-alpha state! If you like what you see, remember that we have over 8 months of additional development left - think about much greater the game will become!\nNote: These are PRE-ALPHA builds and may have bugs, placeholder content, and gameplay balance issues. They're still fun, though!\nLatest Builds\nDownload for Windows\nDownload for OSX\nUpcoming Builds\nWe will be releasing new public builds through the end of APRIL, at which point builds will only be available to $15+ backers!\n  Tangledeep is designed with all the depth that is the hallmark of the roguelike genre - wonderfully diverse items, monsters, procedurally-generated locations, strategic gameplay, endless replayability, and deep customization.\nAnd just like console RPGs in the 16-bit era brought accessibility to an often dense and arcane genre, so too does Tangledeep offer a portal to the incredible depth of roguelikes with beautiful, easy-to-understand presentation and gameplay.\nOf course, this is not to say the game is easy! The trials will be great, the battles intense, and you will surely die. But you will see every challenge coming - nothing is unpredictable or hidden - and come away from each playthrough with more knowledge and better strategies for the next one.\nA surprise encounter with two deadly Panthox!\nIf the concept of 'permadeath' is intimidating, fear not - Tangledeep also has elements of metagame progression, inspired by such games as Rogue Legacy, Dungeonmans, and Shiren the Wanderer. For example, through the memorable and lovable Banker character, you'll be able to store items for future heroes to use in their journey.\nNo two adventures in Tangledeep are the same! Each time you play, the dungeon, its monsters, and items are all procedurally generated. The challenges you'll face will always be fierce, and it's up to you to build the character you want to play, with a highly flexible job system and 12 unique jobs planned.\nLearn skills in any order - mix and match to create custom characters!\nWant to sneak up on monsters, catch them by surprise and use dirty tricks like bombs and backstabs? Try the cunning Brigand!\nDo you prefer to carefully plan your encounters, laying down traps and dispatching enemies before they can get close? The swift Hunter is for you!\nOr how about using powerful elemental magic, modding and manipulating it to create custom spells? Give the Spellshaper a try!\nNot only does each of these jobs (and all the rest) have a distinct playstyle, but you can also mix and match skills from multiple jobs, along with hundreds of items and magic properties to completely customize your character! \nCast of Characters (So Far!)\n\nTangledeep has been in development for just over a year, and has been entirely funded out-of-pocket. Everything is budgeted and planned so that the core vision of the game can be completed no matter what. \nHowever, there are some visual and musical elements that I think would truly make the game look & sound amazing. \nOn the art side, I want to implement more character animations like walking, attacking, or using items. Since every piece of art is hand-drawn pixel-by-pixel, doing this requires significantly more art budget. For example, drawing 2 extra animations per character with 4 frames each requires 8x as many frames as the original character (and thus, 8x the time required!)\nThe Hunter's default idle animation\n  Prototype movement animation!\nMusically, I want to expand the score with special guests contributing to the soundtrack. One such guest is composer Hiroki Kikuta, best known for his work on Secret of Mana and Seiken Densetsu 3, and one of my personal musical heroes!\nIf the Kickstarter succeeds, Kikuta will be writing a track!\nWith your help, we can expand the art and sound budget to create new sprites, write new music tracks, and make the game look & sound truly amazing.\nThe soundtrack of Tangledeep is a particularly important and special task, as the music of classic 16-bit RPGs is among the very finest of all video game soundtracks. Given that I'm a composer, I'll be writing the whole score and paying tribute to these soundtracks I've been listened to for so many years.\n\nAll the music is being written first using an SNES-style sample set, via the Super Audio Cart virtual instrument I designed with OverClocked ReMix. Then, I'll be taking these nostalgic chiptunes and turning them into fully-produced versions of all tracks with modern production!\n\nWith your help, I can also budget for more live musical performers (like Jeff Ball and Jillian Aversa) to help make these modern versions truly shine.\n\nCheck out the player below to see how the soundtrack is shaping up!\n\n  Could there be MORE guests...?!\n  Single Player\nPlatforms: Steam (PC, OSX), Linux forthcoming\nOther Platforms: Possible, as we are developing in Unity!\nControl: Keyboard only, Keyboard+mouse, Mouse only, controller\nMSRP: $15-20\nRelease Date: Q4 2017 (see Roadmap below for details!)\nFor the rest of the year, there will be ongoing work creating new content like items, monsters, NPCs, side areas, art, music. We're also constantly doing bug fixes, balance tweaks, polish, and optimization.\nThat being said, there are some major milestones and features planned which we've outlined in this handy roadmap below! \nNOTE: As is the case with game development, all features and dates are subject to change!\n   Andrew Aversa (@zirconST) - Programming, Design, Music\nHello! I'm a composer, and the owner and lead developer at Impact Soundworks, a music software company. So, when I'm not writing code for Tangledeep, I'm writing code for virtual orchestras, guitars, world instruments, and unique tools like Super Audio Cart. Since 2008 I've worked on and shipped over 30 software titles.\nYou might also know me as the electronic artist zircon (YouTube / Facebook), an alias under which I've released about a dozen albums and 30+ game remixes! I've also been part of the game industry for over 10 years, writing music for both AAA productions like Soulcalibur V as well as mobile games like Tap My Katamari, and indie titles. I've seen games through from conception to completion and I couldn't pick a better industry to work in.\nPersonally, I've had a very close connection to games for as long as I can remember. Besides playing them avidly in the 16 and 32-bit eras, I started creating games using QBasic, Klik n' Play, and mIRCScript (text-based IRC MUDs!) while growing up. I'm also a huge of tabletop gaming, especially pen & paper RPGs (I've been running a Pathfinder campaign for over 2 years now.)\nAndrew Luers (@OceansAndrew) - Environmental Art, UI / UX\nAndrew Luers (a.k.a. OA) is a UX designer, pixel artist, star musician and fitness guru hailing from Minneapolis! (He's also the beautiful and handsome face of OverClocked University, a kick-ass video game cover band you should check out.)\nFervir (@BlankTheVidya) - Character & Monster Art, Icons, Combat FX\nFervir has infused the world of Tangledeep with personality through awesome characters, sweet monsters and stylish animations. And while he's a true specialist in pixel art and animation, he's also a seasoned one-man game developer with skills in code, music, sound and design.\nLachlan Cartland (@AlcopopStar) - Item and Equipment Art\nLachlan is a freelance pixel artist from Melbourne, Australia who previously worked on Dungeonmans, among other projects - a game I worked on as well! - which was Kickstarted and launched to widespread acclaim in 2014. \nNo physical rewards?!\nI've been involved with 4 Kickstarter campaigns to date - three music albums, and one game (Dungeonmans!) All were successful, and all of them shipped. But all of them showed me that physical rewards are some of the most difficult things to manage of any campaign. They always end up more time-consuming than you would think, between manufacturing, approval, packaging, shipping + handling, not to mention more expensive.\n\nI would rather spend that time and money on making Tangledeep the best game possible. I hope you'll agree! \nThat being said, the digital rewards we've created are pretty awesome too. In the place of things like shirts, books, and posters, we've got things like immortalizing your name or handle in the game itself all the way up to collaborating with us to design new items and monsters. How cool is that?\nChief Chance Kisaragi could be YOUR NAME!\n  For 6 months now, Tangledeep has been in 'public development', and I intend on keeping it that way! This means you can always:\nChat on Discord - Talk to me and other players about your experiences!\n\nRead the Dev Log - See what goes into the game every build, and contribute your own suggestions or feedback!\n\nWatch Development Live - I'm shooting to stream development a couple times a week, always announced on Twitter (@TangledeepGame) first!\n\nAs mentioned above, public builds will continue to be available through the end of April, 2017. After this, builds will only be available to $15+ backers.\n\nOn 3/27, thanks to the generous support of over 500 backers, Tangledeep was funded! And that means there is even more we can do to make the game as awesome as possible!\n\nI'm acutely aware of how stretch goals can cause a project to balloon out of scope, delaying the whole thing or using up more budget than expected. I've carefully planned future development to avoid this sort of thing; so while I'd love to list something like \"Full overworld map with 50 new locations!\" as a stretch goal, I know that with only one programmer (me), that could be really risky.  \n\nInstead, I've created a bunch of stretch goals that really benefit the game in other ways - art, music, writing - without running the risk of delaying the project. I think once you see them, you'll agree: they're well-worth it!\nI'm very proud of how colorful, diverse, and creative the cast of Tangledeep is shaping up to be. We've got fat raccoon mechants, literal casino sharks, seven playable jobs, cat people... It's great. But while their in-game sprites are great, it would be even better if we could show their personality with pixel portraits!  \n\nThese would appear in things like your character sheet (changing based on your job), the upcoming in-game Compendium, and during conversations with NPCs.\n\nFrom GoldenEye, Perfect Dark and Banjo-Kazooie to Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning, Desktop Dungeons and the upcoming Yooka-Laylee, Grant Kirkhope has created some of the very best scores to the most classic games of the last two decades. \n\n...and if we hit this stretch goal, we can add Tangledeep to his incredible body of work! \n\nI've got an outline for the story of Tangledeep, and while I'm going to expand on it in-game, the time I can spend is limited. That's why with this stretch goal, I can recruit the help of a great writer to flesh out the lore and world of the game! This would be done by way of: \nMore interesting flavor text for various items \nVarious \"lore drops\" like journal entries, books, historical records\nExtended dialogue with NPCs \nStory quests, key items \nIn-game compendium entries\nThis way, people that want to learn more about the world of Tangledeep will have a rich variety of sources to do so. (Of course, if you want to do nothing but hunt for treasure, that's fine too.)\n\nThe OC ReMix community is responsible for thousands and thousands of amazing, free video game arrangements and over 50 album projects. It's where I got my start, met my wife Jill, and many of my closest friends. \n\nI would like nothing more than to see (and hear) the community create a remix album of the Tangledeep soundtrack, and pay all the ReMixers for their hard work! This album would no doubt feature an amazing range of musical styles and interpretations. \n\nIf you want an idea of what these awesome musicians are capable of, you might start with the Final Fantasy VI: Balance and Ruin album project I directed, and which is available for FREE.\n\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI've been working on Tangledeep since February 2016 and the game is already in a very playable state with PC and Mac compatibility. You can play it for yourself now and see that the game is coming along quite well! \n\nI'm fortunate enough to have financial stability through my music software business Impact Soundworks, and royalties through my artist career. Thus, there is no risk that I'll lose my job and be unable to continue working on or investing in the game myself.\n\nI've also been careful in planning the scope and budget of Tangledeep, implementing all core features and systems already. All new content and work is iterative: more and better art, more items, more skills, more areas, better balance, etc. \n\nHowever, there are always unexpected challenges in game development. Here are a few:\n\n* Bugs can arise that take a long time to solve.\n* System-specific problems can occur, which often take the longest to diagnose and fix.\n* Porting to new platforms (in this case, Linux, which is planned) can be difficult.\n* Changes to Steam or other actions by Valve can make it take longer to get a game on the platform\n* Health or family issues can affect anybody working on the game.\n\nI've done my best to plan for these risks as best I can by allowing 8+ months and leaving an entire month (November) for bug fixing and polish.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Moss Jelly", "descp": "Thank you for supporting Tangledeep!

Through solving environmental puzzles and defeating formidable enemies, you will come to explore the millions of possible spell combinations on your path to becoming a real mage! \nThe story is being written by bestselling author Ed Greenwood, creator of the Forgotten Realms fantasy world for Dungeons and Dragons, which served as the basis for games like Baldur\u2019s Gate and Neverwinter Nights, as well as about 170 other fantasy books. \nThis epic adventure has an immersive soundtrack that was recorded live by the Video Game Orchestra and orchestrated by Shota Nakama (Final Fantasy XV, Kingdom Hearts II.5 HD Remaster).\nFeel free to listen to a mash-up of our original OST while reading!\nMages of Mystralia was created around a new and innovative spellcrafting system that allows you to create millions of new ways to fight enemies and solve environmental puzzles!\nTo accomplish this, you are given a spell book with four basic spell types:\nYou can modify these spells by adding and combining different runes to them.\nBehavioral runes: Adds a specific behavior that stacks with other behaviors attached to the spell.\nAugment runes: Modifies the runes to which they are connected, changing the variables of the behavior.\nTrigger runes: Nests additional spells within the current spell when certain trigger conditions are met.\nAs the game progresses, your spell book's contents will grow, opening up an exponentially growing number of options. You can then mix and match runes in order to create mega-spells that are greater than the sum of their parts. For example:\nIf we start with an Actus Orb of Fire...\n By adding the 'Move' behavior rune, we get a fireball.\n And adding a 'Duplicate' behavior rune gives us a triple fireball.\nNow if we attach the 'Duplicate' behavior rune to an Ice Ego spell instead, it gives an ice sculpture that can be used as a decoy to escape enemies.\nThen, we can add the 'Periodic' trigger rune to our ice sculpture to nest another spell. When prompted, we select the triple fireball. This creates an ice turret!\nFinally, attaching the 'Right' augment rune on the turret will make it turn clockwise, shooting in 360 degrees.\nYou can also use 'Rain', 'Impact', 'Teleport' and many more amazing runes to create even crazier spells!\nFour spell types, four elements and eighteen runes can be placed on the spellcrafting grid in order to create tons of incredible combinations! Whenever we put the spellcrafting system in front of new players, someone invariably comes up with a new spell we've never seen before!\nSo you're not constrained by what we, the game's creators, put in the game for you to discover. Instead, you are limited only by your own creativity and imagination.\nAt PAX East, PAX West, PAX South, PAX East again, SXSW and the PlayStation Experience, the reaction to our spell system has been incredible! But don't take our word for it, here is what the media had to say:\nLearn more about our unique spellcrafting system!\nWant to learn more about Mages of Mystralia's unique approach to spellcrafting? We've got you covered! The following video combines parts 1-3 of our spellcrafting tutorial, narrated by none other than Dan Adelman himself.\n\nKeep in mind that this video only gives you a (very) small insight of all the possibilities offered! What spells will YOU create?\nMages of Mystralia has responsive action-adventure controls that have been perfected to feel intuitive and fun.\nBut be careful... The world of Mystralia is a dangerous place. Monsters roam freely in the wilds and you never know what enormous creatures lurk in the shadowy corners of the realm... \nThis polished gameplay, combined with the moving soundtrack and beautifully rendered cel shaded graphics really allowed the team to bring this immersive game to a level of quality that they are extremely proud of.\nIn Mages of Mystralia, you play as Zia, a young woman who discovers that she has been born with an innate sense of magic. Unfortunately, arcane powers have been banned from the kingdom, forcing her to go into exile and learn the ways of magic as she looks to gain some control over her powers and stumbles into a story of epic proportions!\nOn her journey, she meets other exiled mages and discovers runes with magical properties, realizing that she can combine these in different ways to come up with millions of new spells!\nWhen Ed Greenwood set to the task of writing the story of Zia\u2019s adventure, he couldn\u2019t help but flesh out the entire world and its lore. The history of the kingdom of Mystralia was an interesting enough story in its own right, so we worked with acclaimed webcomic creators Brian Clevinger and Carey Pietsch to tell that story in comic book form.\nThe more you know your Mystralia history, the better you\u2019ll be able to identify the subtle references to these events of the past and how they\u2019ve come to shape Zia\u2019s present.\nA wide range of different environments are spread out across the vast world of Mystralia, where villagers, merchants and mages live. You will explore the many different areas of the game in order to find epic treasure, solve mind-bending puzzles and experiment with spells in order to become a true mage!\nMages of Mystralia\u2019s original orchestral score was performed by the Video Game Orchestra and orchestrated by Shota Nakama, one of the masterminds behind the scores of Final Fantasy XV and Kingdom Hearts II.5 HD Remaster.\nFurthermore, the music in the game is dynamic, meaning that depending on the setting and the actions a player makes, the music will adapt itself, adding instruments, accelerating or slowing the pace and basically modulating to fit every in-game situation!\n Some of the projects our team members have worked on previously :\nBorealys Games is made up of experienced developers who\u2019ve spent years working in the AAA industry, which really allowed the team to add that extra layer of polish to the gameplay and visual elements of the game.\nThe game is already a lot of fun and the players' response at events has been heartwarming, but we still have some polish (improved animations, particle effects, and enhanced sound effects - among others) that we think will really take the game to the next level. In addition, we also have a few features up our sleeves as stretch goals that we would love to obtain.\nMore importantly, we want to get feedback on the game from our most ardent supporters, who will get the beta immediately after the campaign is processed!\nAlthough the team has had years of experience in the industry, Mages of Mystralia is the studio's first public appearance and we are coming to Kickstarter to find and grow our core player community.\nWe want fans of magical action-adventure games to join us as we look towards the game's official launch in Q2 of 2017!\nRecently there have been several Kickstarter campaigns that have raised an amount of funding to prove that the concept is viable, but then seek publisher or outside investor support for what they really need. We are taking the opposite approach. We built our proof-of-concept, got investment, and made our game. It is fully playable beginning to end, and many would consider it complete.\nBut as we\u2019ve observed our playtesters and gotten feedback, we\u2019ve generated a ton of ideas that would not take too long to implement but have the power to take this game to the next level. Adding all of those little tweaks and extra polish will only add a couple months to our schedule, so for a relatively modest sum, we can have a huge impact.\nOf course, we already have plans for how we\u2019d like to expand the game post launch with new game modes. If we exceed our goal, we\u2019ll be able to staff up more aggressively and deliver those new features sooner than if we had to wait for the game to launch.\n Adding digital copies to your order is simple:\nSelect your preferred pledge tier from the right of the page.\nAt checkout, add 25$CAD ($19 US) for each extra digital copy you would like.\nAt the end of the campaign, you will receive a Backer Form to confirm your add-ons and preferred platform(s) for your digital keys.\nAdding a physical add-ons to your order is simple:\nSelect your desired pledge tier from the right of the campaign page.\nAt checkout, simply add the value of your desired Add-on(s) and the shipping fee that corresponds to your location.\nAt the end of the campaign, you will receive a Backer Form to confirm your add-ons, address and T-Shirt size(s).\nBox Art shown as reference only and subject to change.\nThe Silver Treasure Chest contains:\nOne Mages of Mystralia pin\nOne Mages of Mystralia t-shirt\nOne soft-cover copy of the 64-page Mages of Mystralia comic book by Brian Clevinger and Carey Pietsch\nOne full-color 11x17 Mages of Mystralia poster\nThe Golden Treasure Chest contains:\nOne Mages of Mystralia pin\nOne exclusive Mages of Mystralia dev team t-shirt\nOne soft-cover copy of the 64-page Mages of Mystralia comic book by Brian Clevinger and Carey Pietsch\nOne limited full-color 11x17 Mages of Mystralia poster, signed by Ed Greenwood\nOne double-vinyl version of Mages of Mystralia's original OST, orchestrated by Shota Nakama and performed by the Video Game Orchestra\nFinal Week Standalone Add-ons!\nDue to popular demand, we've also added the following standalone physical add-ons.

We made a short video to express our appreciation and show you some new alpha gameplay. Look for Cattails on Steam in late 2017. You guys rock!!\nPLAY\n\nMissed the Kickstarter but interested in Cattails? Check out our website for more information or keep reading!\nBecome a cat! Hunt, fight, explore, and socialize in an expansive open world. \nCattails is an indie game made by a husband-and-wife team.\nIn Cattails, the player takes the role of a feral cat that roams an expansive open land. The player hunts for food, combats cats from other colonies, and develops valuable relationships. The player can also romance one of many eligible cats and raise a family!\n    Track down creatures for a satisfying snack! Cats of the wild must eat to survive, so be sure to pounce stealthily to catch your prey.\nHunting is a careful balancing act; get close enough to pounce, but not too close or your victim may flee!\n  Cattails uses a unique real-time skill-based hunting system that allows you to stalk your prey anywhere throughout the open world. Find mice, rabbits, frogs, birds, squirrels, and more!\n  Each cat belongs to one of many wild cat colonies. Cats are very territorial creatures! \nThe colonies have territories that they protect and maintain; if you wander too close to the borders or into the unclaimed regions, get ready for a fight! \nGain dynamic territory throughout the world by battling off enemy cats or by invading another colony's land. \nUnlock new and exciting fighting skills to help you survive battles and master the art of feral combat!  \n  Explore the forest to find the best spots to hunt. Gather herbs and berries that can give your cat many different advantages such as healing or speedy paws! Sell them for some extra money or give them away as gifts.\nSwim the mighty rivers to reach new territory. Discover rare prey and bring back exotic gifts to give to your friends!\nSeasons pass and each day is different. Cattails features a dynamic and meaningful weather system, generating everything from light snowfall to blizzards and from sunny days to thunderstorms. Prey, herbs, and other cats react to the shifts in climate and the forecast. \n  Become friends, lovers, or enemies with dozens of unique cats. Befriend or battle the other inhabitants of the forest. \nWork for the glory of one of the great cat colonies or set out to adventure on your own!\nTalk and give gifts to the many cats that inhabit the colonies to unlock unique dialog options and become good friends with them. \nMany of the cats are marriageable, allowing you to start your own cat family!\nSurvive in style with hundreds of fur and eye color combinations.

He has professional experience with web development and has fostered community management skills for many years, but his true passion is game development. He started making video games when he was 10 years old, and hasn't stopped since. Tyler is working full time on Cattails to bring it to life!\nRebekah Thompson - Marketing Coordinator\nRebekah is Tyler's amazing wife and leads all aspects of social media and marketing. She has a strong technical background and uses her skills daily for software development contract work. She provides constant feedback and helps manage the Cattails project. She also acts as the front-end for all professional inquiries.\nThe money raised through Kickstarter for Cattails will go towards making the game as best as it can be. Out of the initial goal, here's the percentage breakdown:\nYour help will allow us to commission the rest of the fantastic soundtrack (see above for a sample,) fund development costs such as product licenses and fees, and finance more incredible artwork for Cattails. \nThanks so much for helping us bring our project to life!\n                                                                                                                                         ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nFirst and foremost, making a game takes a lot of time. We fully expect to have Cattails ready by the end of 2017, but for a variety of reasons it may take longer to complete if art, music, or programming work meets unexpected challenges.\n\nAdditionally, Cattails is our first commercial release for PC, and our first game that includes paid work from independent contractors. We have full confidence that everyone we are working with is fully capable of getting the work necessary for Cattails done by the end of the year, but again, it is possible that it may take longer depending on a multitude of factors.\n\nDespite these risks, we are certain that we will be able to finish the game and get it out to the backers. Our lead developer, Tyler, has a proven track record of finishing games and iterating upon them for many years after completion to ensure that they're as good as they can be. He left his job as a software engineer to work full time on Cattails and will devote all his effort and energy into completing this ambitious project.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "~ Kind-hearted Kitten ~", "descp": "Thank you for supporting Cattails!\nINCLUDES:\nName in credits\n\"Thank You\" email with cute cat gif", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2017"}], "stat": ["46 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 15 or more", "title": "~ Courageous Cat - STANDARD ~", "descp": "Get a digital copy of Cattails on Steam for all supported platforms when the game launches!

The game will adapt to your play-style, giving you tailored rewards and changing the main plot as you define what kind of a God you are. Benevolent rulers will get better, more specific options to convert civilizations. A crewel God will unlock more sophisticated tools of manipulation. There are 4 different endings to find, each requiring a different style of play!\nUpgrades cost you souls PER SECOND!\nPREMIUM galaxy generation\nEach new game creates a galaxy generated from a seed. thousands of stars with tens of thousands of planets. Each one with ore to mine and air to absorb. Each planet with life has their own unique set of socio-economic problems that grow more complex as they advance through 10 different civilization stages.\n  Thousands of living, evolving civilizations\n  Stars have planets, planets have aliens!\n Deep, reactive, simulated societies \nBehind every civilization is a vast network of variables interacting with one another in real-time. A change in one will set off a butterfly effect that ripples through the entire population. \nBehind every great civilization...\nIt's how all these variables interact with each other that forms a working society, and determines how ready they are to be converted. To convert a planet, you have to choose a Promise, and a Threat. The system then determines if those choices properly reflect their current situation, and if the people like you enough, they'll be converted!\nEvery religion has a Promise and a Threat\nCrafting\nEvery planet can be mined, and every atmosphere can be absorbed. The extracted elements can be crafted into goods and then transported to the surface of a planet to influence the population! Give them gold and stimulate their economy! Give them TNT and encourage their military! With over 75 different substances to create, you'll find endless ways to spread your influence. \nCombine elements and create compounds!\nThe more technologically advanced a civilization is, the harder it becomes to convince them you're a god. Could you imagine if a ball of light came down to earth today, gave us a pile of salt, and then claimed to be an all powerful ruler? Maybe a stone aged civilization would fall for it, but it wouldn't convince a suitably advanced society. \n75+ Compounds to create!\nLasers\nSometimes you need to destroy stuff. Say a planet has too many unemployed people. What are you to do? You could stimulate the economy to create more jobs, or you can simply kill all the homeless with lasers. Problem solved!\nSo many targets to choose from!\n  With dozens of targets to choose from and various levels of intensities, lasering a population is a totally valid way to show em' what kind of god you are. \nSo many targets to choose from!\nHuge amounts of content\nWith Over 30 hours of audio recordings, graphics for 40+ alien species, 40+ planet types, 75+ compounds to create, 25+ elements to extract, and infinite ways to play, Passenger can be replayed over and over again without seeing or hearing the same thing twice. \nAlien Species\n Micro-Managing\nThe game doesn't stop at simply converting planets. Master manipulators will stick around and continue to influence the species. The planets that generate the most souls are ones that have large populations and high death rates. The trick is to help them until they are suitably advanced, without them getting so smart they don't need religion anymore. Luckily, once you convert a civilization you unlock the Core menu, which gives you an at-a-glance overview of all the stats of the planets you've converted. \nView stats about converted planets\n    Why Kickstarter?\nIt has a global reach, and gives an amazing platform for new indie game developers to show what they've got. It's a whole new age where people get to take risks with unconventional genres and play styles, and in many ways I believe kickstarter is to thank for that. It's given funding and legitimacy to strange and amazing ideas.\nWhere will the money go?\nIf funded, the money will go towards paying for more voice actors, paying for a musician, and paying for our living expenses while we drop every other obligation in our lives to finish the game.\nIs this just a concept, or what? Like, how far along is it?\nPassenger is already 50% done.\nIt has already been in production for the past year and a half and almost ready for alpha testing. \nAll that is left is to record more audio, finish drawing the hundreds of images, and inputting the quests and anomalies. The entire universe works and lives and evolves. Everything is balanced and working, so basically we need to populate it with CONTENT. \nHow will this be released?! Will I be able to play it on my Mac?!\nYOU ABSOLUTELY WILL! Passenger will be released on PC, MAC, and LINUX. The only thing holding us back from exporting it to consoles is licenses and money. (Stretch goals)\nMotion graphics for days\n  Our team is made up of some super serious talent.\nJesse Miki - Developer\nNoah Hurley - Creative Director\nSam McLean - Writer\nRobYn Slade - Your ship's voice\nThe dream team\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIf one of us dies, that would be a problem. \nAsides from that, we have already agreed we are finishing the game no matter what happens. If we don't get funding, the game will still be made, just in 5 times the time.

Shishimai Rinka was just an average high schooler, until an accident makes her a participant of a ritual known only as Divine Selection. What answers await her...?\nThis is your chance to help fund the development of a new marvelous visual novel by the team who brought you Sound of Drop - fall into poison -.\nNot only is this campaign set to fund the development of this new title, but it\u2019ll also fund voice acting with top caliber voice acting talent ready to bring each character to life.\nShishimai Rinka was a high schooler who ran a small caf\u00e9 named Lion House in place of her grandmother. She lived her life much like any other person her age, but one day, she was caught up in an explosion while returning home on the train alongside her friend, Hitsuji Naomi. In an attempt to save her friend's life, she shields her on instinct the moment the explosion goes off, losing her life in the process. However, before she knew it, she was back at Lion House, happily chatting with her friends as if nothing had happened in the first place.  \n\"Good evening, my lovely little slaves to fate.\"  \n A few days later, she found herself in a strange world. Here she met Parca, an odd girl claiming to be a goddess. It turns out that she had somehow become a participant in Divine Selection, a ritual carried out over twelve weeks by twelve people, which allowed them to compete in order to undo their deaths. Yet, what shocked Rinka most of all, was the presence of her friend Mishima Miharu amongst the twelve.  \nIn order to get through Divine Selection, one must eliminate others by gathering information regarding their name, cause of death and regret in the real world, then \"electing\" them.  \nThis turn of events would lead to her learning about the truth behind her death, as well as her own personal regrets. She would also come to face the reality that Miharu was willing to throw her life away for her sake, as well as the extents to which the other participants would go to for the sake of living through to the end.  \nFar more experiences than she ever could have imagined awaited her now, but where will her resolve lead her once all is said and done...?\nWe at aiueoKompany are currently hard at work on Fatal Twelve, our upcoming game. While our previous game Sound of Drop - fall into poison- received praise for its focus on the fickle and unseemly side of humanity, we plan on having Fatal Twelve show that people can also be resolute and courageous when the time calls for it. \nFurthermore, we chose to challenge ourselves even further through the inclusion of voice acting this time around, in the hopes of delivering further emotional impact.  \nThat being said, in order to accomplish this goal, we've chosen to ask for the backing of our supporters through Kickstarter. We have a number of rewards prepared for those who do help us, including access to the game on Steam, physical copies of the game alongside an artbook, OST, drama CD, and much more.\nOf course, the main reward for everyone though will be the inclusion of the voice acting itself. We've prepared plenty of reward tiers for those who wish to provide their support, so make sure to check them all out before deciding! We have every desire and intention of living up to the expectations of those looking forward to Fatal Twelve.

Additionally, we'd like to launch it on Xbox, PS4, Nintendo Switch and PS Vita - but ports for these consoles will only be possible after achieving labeled stretch goals!\nChris Carter of Destructoid\n                                                                                                                                The team has many ideas on where to expand, but first thing's first. If we achieve our base funding we will begin updating the goals as fast as you can fund them. Further down the line you may see expansions the include: more levels, guest appearances from game industry veterans, console ports, new game modes, and maybe even a collaboration with more friends.\nPrisma follows the adventures of a young explorer named Ray. In the middle of one of her expeditions, she finds herself in a peculiar situation with a mischievous girl named Fractal.\nFractal seeks Ray\u2019s help to find and destroy magical masks that are spread throughout the world of Aura. The masks have a malevolent influence upon powerful creatures across the land, and so the masks must be destroyed to restore order. Since Fractal cannot accomplish this task alone, she lends Ray her dimension shifting powers to help Ray overcome the many obstacles on their journey. \nFractal Swooping In\nAccompanied by Ignus, Fractal\u2019s silent confidante, Ray and Fractal set out on a worldwide adventure to destroy these mysterious masks, and free the ones under their power.\nWe encourage the player to experience Prisma to their liking. The story of Prisma is optional for those who wish to focus on gameplay. Story elements will be shared through cutscenes, environmental storytelling, and through the ability to converse with characters throughout the game.\nDialogue System Example\nFractal gives Ray the ability to switch between four dimensions, three of which harbor unique abilities: the ability to jump higher, the ability to run faster, and the ability to break obstacles. The fourth dimension, \u201cNeutrality,\u201d does not provide any special powers, but is just as important as the other dimensions to master.  \nIn the finished title, each dimension will give Ray a different outfit that compliment her toggled power. Additionally, her personality differs between dimensions slightly when talking to NPC's in the world in her reactions and in what lines the NPC delivers.\nRay's Different Planned Dimension Outfits\nThe player will find that specific objects exist and act differently in one dimension and not the others. It will be necessary to switch between the four dimensions in order to make use of platforms to overcome environmental challenges.\nSwitching Between 2 Dimensions\nIn the example above, Ray is switching between the 'Neutral' dimension and the \u201cGrace\u201d dimension. Two platforms can be seen coming in and out of existence that never exist at the same time. The player must figure out a way to clear the obstacle by switching between the dimensions and determining how to proceed.  \nSwitching into a specific dimension is not only important to reveal certain objects within that dimension, but also to utilize that dimension\u2019s unique ability.  \nIn the \"Grace\" dimension, Ray can jump much higher, allowing her to reach unattainable heights.\nIn \"Will\" she can run faster, allowing her to jump across wider gaps.\nIn \"Strength\" she can punch though blockades, allowing her to open new pathways.\nThese three abilities can also be combined. For example, the ability to run faster carries over into other dimensions. When the player has started to run fast, they can switch into the \u201cGrace\u201d dimension in order to run fast and jump higher. Additionally, the player can switch into the \u201cStrength\u201d dimension while running fast, and punch through obstacles while running. We encourage the player to get creative with how they choose to combine these powers.\nOn her journey, Ray will meet a colorful cast of characters, both friend and foe. Her adversaries will challenge her mastery of the dimensional powers, while her allies will teach her about the vast world of Aura and its many distinct regions.  \nThere are five main regions to overcome, each with a boss eager to challenge Ray\u2019s skill.\nThe inhabitants of Aura are a colorful lot concerned with maintaining their ways of life. With the threat of the mysterious masks, they are willing to do everything in their power to support Ray on her journey.\nThe Boom-Men of the Kasteel Desert\nHowever, not everyone is so happy to lend a helping hand. Some creatures will present themselves as additional obstacles to overcome. Not only does Ray need to worry about navigating the dangerous terrain of Aura while also switching between four dimensions, she must worry about these sometimes aggressive creatures as well.\nOwpeck enemy from the Yokiburu Mountains\nEach region of Aura also contains hidden masks to collect. The discovery of these hidden masks will unlock a secret sixth region, where Ray can experience more unique creatures and challenges.\nYukiburu Mountains\nTuambood Archipelago\nHruan Ruin\nMuch like talking to the characters of Aura, the collection of these hidden masks is optional. Taking on this additional challenge is up to the player.\nPrisma will feature a full soundtrack with original compositions for each region of Aura, including a special theme song for each boss!\nIn addition to all the wonderful music by our composer Alex Liberatore, we have arranged to collaborate with artists established from some of the classics we grew up with. Composers from the Metal Gear Solid series and Final Fantasy have already been arranged as stretch goals to the project. So it is up to you for us to have their hands included on our final game.\nWe are introducing backer achievements to gamify spreading the word to as many eyes as possible.

We want to make stylish and memorable games that respect and challenge players. With your help, we would like to bring this vision to life beginning with Prisma.\nSo far we have all core mechanics and technical challenges programmed, as well a most of the pre-visualization for the rest of the game. While we only have the 1st world of 5 polished, production as a whole stands at around 40% complete with the whole game.\nAllocation of Funds\nAny money gained will be going directly into development cost to bring the rest of the game to completion sometime at the end of this year unless we push past our 40k funding goal. After which we begin adding features and the scope changes (for the better).\nWe are currently aiming for a PC & Mac, but are hoping that we can raise enough money to be able to post to consoles like the Xbox 1, PS4, PSVita, and Switch.\nOur base Kickstarter goal will allow 3 of us to work full time for 8 months on the game. At base funding, We plan to release episodically per world. All episodes will be included for anyone who backed on Kickstarter starting at the $10 tier. If we exceed our goal to our 40k stretch goal, we will instead release Prisma all at once in a single non-episodic release.\nWe are looking to secure money so that the team can work on Prisma full time. Kickstarter would allow us to finish Prisma in a timely fashion and support the livelihood of the team. We also hope to give Prisma the full attention it deserves in terms of polishing art and features. For example, fleshing out a \u201cSpeed Run\u201d mode that allows players to test their skills against a timer for bragging rights among friends or to collect in-game trophies.\nThe Team. Not Pictured: Hank, Kevin, & Khoa.\nWith a collective 14+ games shipped amongst us, Shiny Bolt is a diverse team with backgrounds ranging from mobile, MMO's, AAA development, and film. But the team's focus lies on one thing- making great games that WE like to play. More specifically, we strive to make games that respect and challenge the player while paying ode to many classics from SNES, Gamecube, PS2, and others where our golden era of gaming gripped us. Before we banded together to form a company, we became friends and came up with Prisma in college. Since then, members of the team have been working in the entertainment industry while developing Prisma on the side as a passion project. Many honors later the team has scattered around the world, but our common passion still binds us together. We can not wait to share Prisma with you in the future, as near or far as that may be.\n   ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nPrisma has been in some form of development for many a year at this point in time. Our biggest challenge since we've began has been purely contributed to growing pains. Since the project's infancy, the team has collectively gained almost 30 years of experience. What we can (and have) created now is so much further beyond what we even thought was acceptable years ago. Our standards are higher now than ever.\n\nWith that polish comes checks and balances that we need to address in management. Our business and production plans are written in their entirety, but the tides of development challenges move back in forth in unpredictable ways. We have a projected launch window and plan to hit it hard, but this is only with the minimum amount of funding.\n\nAny funding further beyond our base goal will be great and truly make Prisma greater than we can dream. Stretch goals do adjust the goal post for our release depending on how much of a full-fledged realization our final goal determines. Ultimately this will lead to a much greater final product.\n\nBeyond the game itself, we are very confident in delivering all of our tier rewards in a timely fashion. We want all of our backers to enjoy and celebrate their love of the game. That said, only a small number of the team will be responsible for delivering and mailing out the rewards. So we are limited in our resources, but fully committed to the backers.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "Creator-tier", "descp": "A DRM-free digital copy of Prisma & The Masquerade Menace is yours to master!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["74 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 15 or more", "title": "Classical-tier", "descp": "DRM-free copy of the game, PDF instruction booklet, and a set of Backer-only wallpapers.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["14 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 20 or more", "title": "Gamma-tier", "descp": "EXCLUSIVE Alternate player skins for Ray available only to Kickstarter Backers.

With this game, we are merging a deep turn-based tactical game with an elaborate RPG experience that takes players on a journey to reclaim a lost kingdom.\nAt it\u2019s core, Forged of Blood is a 3D isometric tactical game that will force players to think critically and creatively both in and out of the tactical combat phase. Positioning, build efficiency, and tactics can mean the difference between victory and defeat in battle, while managing your characters outside of combat poses new and interesting opportunities.\nDeveloping Forged of Blood has, and continues to be a labor of love that turned this passion project into the sort of game we\u2019ve always dreamed about making. From tabletop to the classic RPGs of old, our\u2019s is a project in which we plan on merging the elements of classic RPGS and tactical games into a contemporary take on the genre. \n Game Summary:\nThe vision for Forged of Blood has always been to create a deep tactical experience currently in development for the PC. That means character building customization that will have tactical consequences in as many ways as possible and setting it all against a brand new fantasy backdrop. So far, we\u2019ve created an experience for our game that, while focused on the tactical experience, will develop interesting choices on and off the battlefield.\nA Fantasy World Afire: Our game introduces a morally grey hard fantasy world on the cusp of a predestined upheaval. Forged of Blood will throw you into a beautiful new world filled with both monsters and men across multiple environments in 3D; in a world that has a richly developed history.\nMeaningful Choices Throughout the Game: This is a design philosophy that we\u2019ve truly hammered into every facet of the game. Whether it be the branching narratives, the tactical combat, or the minutia of character building, every choice will have meaningful consequence.\nBuild Your Characters Your Way: With 9 weapons and weapon ability trees, 6 general ability trees, a vast magic crafting system, the characters under your command are yours to build from the ground up to fit any tactical need.\nA True Spellcrafting System: This is the spellcrafting system of our dreams, with a staggering 3822 unique effect combinations and an incalculable number of permutations when you account for effect and global modifiers.\nAll Things (Tactically) Considered: Once on the battlefield, players will have to take into consideration a plethora of tactical factors. Will you have the right composition of characters to take on a particular challenge? Is the high ground worth taking or would the costs be too high? Build efficiency, positioning, and turn order all matter - will you be able to take advantage of it?\nForged of Blood is a decidedly ambitious project for a studio for our size, but we have lived up to our wildest expectations in each build we push out. We\u2019ve committed our own money to not only start the studio, but to finish the game, but we\u2019ve taken the project to Kickstarter to make the game even better with your help.\nIf we\u2019ve piqued your interest so far, keep going and check out the full breakdown of our game below.\n  3D Fantasy World:\nSpecific to our game is a brand new hard fantasy world with rich histories, horrors, and mysteries for you to explore. Central to this world will be the unique creatures and races you will face. Monsters and men come to life in Unreal Engine 4 as Forged of Blood takes you across the beautifully imagined continent of Attiras.\nFace tribal giants, strange creatures, and quell the fires of a world that is slowly tearing itself apart. Forged of Blood will take you from ancient ruins and castles to deserts and snowy mountains, we are excited to take you on an adventure that spans the varied biomes of our world.\nIn the case of some of our larger creatures that cover multiple tiles, each creature will feature a unique set of strengths and weakness. These multi-tiled creature will also involve unique strategies to deal with as attacks on specific tiles (or body parts) will have different outcomes. We won\u2019t go into too much detail here as we really do want players to experience the surprises for themselves, but we\u2019ve really focused our efforts into making each monster tier a unique experience in and of itself.\n  Nine Unique Weapon Trees:\nEach of our nine weapons not only come in different materials, tiers, and special quality modifiers, but also feature their own ability trees - both passive and active. Our focus on player freedom means: no classes, just weapons and their ability trees - and every weapon tree can be leveled up and built to fit the character build you want. With 9 different types of weapons to chose as primary and then 8 weapon options for secondary, the players can effectively make 72 different weapon combinations, not counting the variations that come from dual wielding, shield options, and magic.\nOn the battlefield, the primary and secondary weapon sets can prove vital in taking on a fluid tactical situation, as players can switch from between their equipped weapons to fit their needs.\nMeanwhile, crafted and enchanted armor and weapons can further refine your character builds or open up new possibilities.\nIn addition to the various weapon combinations and weapon ability progressions, weapons can be crafted from 5 different materials, have up to 4 distinct quality modifiers selected from 13 possible quality modifiers, and imbued with 6 distinct possible enchantments from level 1 to 5. To give a sense of the variations possible, each weapon can be created 169,415 distinct ways, allowing for further refinement of your playstyle.\nFor those who want to understand how I got that, you can have between 0 and 4 quality modifiers chosen from 13 different quality modifiers, 5 different materials, and 6 different enchantments as well as unenchanted. So each character will have 1,524,735 primary weapon options to start, but when you consider the variations in primary and secondary weapon choices, you have 2,066,503,840,200 distinct weapon combinations (excluding dual wielding & shields).\nSix General Ability Trees:\nEvery character and build can be further customized through the six General Ability trees designed to allow the players to hone in the build they want to make. Each tree will offer players a range of unique passive abilities that add (or potentially detract from) the efficiency of a character\u2019s build.\n  Comprehensive Magic and Spell-crafting:\nNo fantasy game would be complete without some awesome magic spells to cast - and we may have gone a little overboard. Even as we tried to constrain ourselves to fit within the lore of our world, we knew we wanted to create a spell crafting system that would let players truly craft their own spells.\nIn Forged of Blood, spells are cast by using stones called Magurite. Each can be attuned to one of three elemental energies, known as Primordials. If you like, you can think of Magurite as charged batteries. You cast spells by either drawing energy from the surrounding area into the stone (Drain) or releasing stored energy (expel). Combining these two will gives us the 6 Primordial energies: Thermal Expel, Thermal Drain, Arcane Expel, Arcane Drain, Spirit Expel, and Spirit Drain.\nStill with us? Great! This is where it gets a little more interesting. There are ten unique effects that vary by these 6 primordial energies. Let\u2019s take one effect as an example, Entropy. A Thermal Expel Entropy will be different from Thermal Drain Entropy.\nThat means that we have a total of 60 options for effects (3 Primordials x 2 Charged States x 10 Effects). Players can add up to five Effects for any spell (provided they meet their control requirements) and can then further customize each Effect through eighteen Effect Modifiers that can alter the trajectory, power, or even targeting of the Effect. With the Effects and Effect Modifiers in place, they can then add a further eighteen Global Modifiers that will shape and customize the entire spell.\nNow, we could say something along the lines of there being 216,600 distinct spell effect combinations, (ignoring that the order of the effects often makes spells effects distinct) making 80,243,201,286,758,000 distinct permutations for 5 distinct global and 5 distinct effect modifiers, spread among all active Effects - and remember that you can have more than 5 of each - the reality is that the majority of those would be trivially distinct. As there is no realistic means for us to give a reliable value of the number of meaningfully unique spells, we\u2019ll simply leave it as \u201ca lot.\u201d\n  Meaningful Choices, on and of the Battlefield:\nWe harp on about \u201cmeaningful choices\u201d pretty much throughout this wall of text and it is absolutely something we\u2019ve pinned on the forefront of every decision. While character builds and tactical decisions have been explained above, we have yet to properly show you how this will affect the narrative.\nAs with any good RPG our\u2019s is a story that will be reactive to player input and, to that end, we\u2019ve incorporated narrative choices that will directly affect the tactical battles as well as the overarching story. This means that the order in which you complete objectives in a single quest can determine the number of enemies or allies you will have on a tactical map. While on the larger scale, your decisions in completing a particular quest could potentially open up or close of other quests down the line. This is of course just a small example of the ways in which the game can react to player decisions both on and off the battlefield.\nWhen not in combat, players will see the world through the Strategic Layer - large map on on an ancient table in which objective markers, party pawns, and faction held territories are held. Here they will command up to three parties that will roam the world, take on quests in their efforts to reclaim the kingdom. Each territory will provide the player\u2019s faction with gold and other unique resources that can be used for crafting our array of unique weapons and armor. While we are still a tactically focused game, our strategic layer gives players the bigger picture at stake, and offers them an additional gameplay layer.\nAdditionally, our Castle Layer will provide players with a reprieve from the combat while offering more gameplay mechanics to tinker with. Whether it be crafting weapons and armor, researching the mysteries of our magic system, or even casting judgments on past foes and fallen allies, Genevan Castle will serve as the player\u2019s base of operations. Players will find that choosing the right upgrades that suite their play style will integral to their progress in the game - potentially giving players access to new missions, unique quests, and the ability to recruit more soldiers to their parties.\n  Morality beyond Good and Evil:\nIn keeping with our aim to push a grey world with meaningful choices, we\u2019ve really tried to implement a morality system that goes beyond our anachronistic notions of good and evil. There will not be a single bar with good on one end and evil on the other, light versus dark, or any sort of coy delineations of those concepts (here\u2019s looking at you Paragon vs. Renegade). Instead we\u2019ve created a system in which player actions will be plotted on a Personality Index comprised of Empathy, Hedonism, and Wisdom.\nMost actions taken by the player will have a corresponding movement along the three axes that will effectively move the player\u2019s Personality Plot. This plot will also have an area around it that will be the player\u2019s Personality Distance Threshold, which will affect the relationships with other characters in the game.\nThis system allows us to create actions and events within the story that will not necessarily be either good or bad. We can explore the motivations of each action and have them be perceived on a scale that isn\u2019t binary - and ultimately create an experience that will be new in the RPG genre. Our personality system is ultimately a more realistic expression of perceived personality and morality than what we\u2019ve often seen in previous games in our genre.\n  Forged of Blood is currently being developed of PC, though we will not rule out additional platforms as we progress.\n  For Forged of Blood, we wanted to introduce a Hard Fantasy world that has specific rules and lore elements to adhere to. Heavily inspired by great fantasy stories with detailed and, perhaps more importantly, rational worlds, we set out to build the world of Attiras into a fully fledged world, complete with a rich history and a unique magic system.\nAttiras is a harsh world filled with strange and powerful creatures, that vary in sentience and behavior. The primitive tribal giants called Sataures, the thick skinned and tempermental Gurrahog, and the ore ingesting Sacer are just some of the creatures players will face - each with their own unique combat characteristics and behaviors.\nBeasts aside, perhaps the true monsters in this world are the sentient denizens who call the world of Attiras home. At the onset of the game, Attiras is a world ruled by a hybrid race of humanoids who have supplanted the former dominant race through sheer brutal conquest. The world we\u2019ve imagined for the game is one that doesn\u2019t pull any punches; genocide, murder, and backstabbing are all par for the political course of this world - as in our own.\n  The story of Forged of Blood takes place a few thousand years after the genesis of the current world order and centers on the actions and relationships of two brothers as they work to reclaim the world. Key to our philosophy is that we create situations that should not be judged by our modern sensibilities and morals.\nIn keeping with our tactical focus on the game, we wanted to keep the story centered around combat but driven by actions. Our biggest challenge is keeping the scope and reactivity of our story within manageable bounds so that we can deliver a consistent narrative throughout; so, we\u2019ve really narrowed our focus on the relationship of the two brothers: the heir, and the player character.\nWithout giving too much away, the story will start with great upheaval that forces the brothers to flee and take refuge in old family estate. From here comes the challenge of reclaiming the world for themselves, while dealing with the differences in opinion that they might have.\n    Critical Forge was born from gamers - tabletop, PC, console, mobile, you name it\u2026 we\u2019ve devoted thousands of hours into each platform. The genesis of our studio really started with a few offhand remarks over various meals about a side project Joe wanted to do: making a tactical game using Unreal Engine 4. As the conversations became a little more detailed and more friends became involved, it quickly blossomed into a project that we all wanted to devote more time into.\nWhen we finally decided to put it all on the line and make this game we know that the adventure will not come easily but decided that the risks are well worth it to pursue this dream of making our own game. We got a small space above a dusty warehouse, begged and borrowed furniture, and finally put together a studio to call our own.\nWith so many things at stake, we decided to take a more cautious and pragmatic route with our production: starting very small both in team size and scope to prototype and worldbuild before expanding into full production. We had tested our base mechanics and ideas tirelessly in the early days and by mid-2016 grown to our full team of ten, who have since pushed Forged of Blood to the game you see today.\nKeep in touch, and don't forget to follow us on:\n  So, you\u2019ve gotten a glimpse of what we\u2019ve done and what\u2019s to come - why should you believe that we can do it?\nEach and every one of us here at the Forge are gamers and we\u2019ve all had the pleasure of working together on larger scale project before striking out on our own. We have a combined three decade\u2019s worth of experience in the industry and the team is so committed to bringing this game to life that we have devoted both our time and money to bringing Forged of Blood to the pre-alpha state it is in now (with a vertical slice and large number of assets completed) to showcase the project to the world.\nWe formed the studio in February 2016 to prototype and begin production on Forged of Blood and we\u2019ve already committed almost $400,000 to see the project through completion. That means, we will see this project through to the end and risk it all because we believe in this project - but that\u2019s where you come in.\nWe want to make this game shine:\nWith your help, we can make this game even better than what we\u2019ve envisioned and scrounged for. That means giving us the breathing room to make more maps to do battle on, a more reactive storyline and world for you to explore, and more unique models to really bring to life this world we\u2019ve made for you. Additional funds will also help us expand the limited budget on VO work and music, and allow us to explore even more possibilities to make Forged of Blood a vision of dreams.\nAs of March 2017, we\u2019ve taken the game from a fleeting idea in our heads to a pre-alpha state with our core game loops implemented in the first year. We\u2019ve put our hearts and souls - and our savings - to bring this project to this stage in development and we need your help to push us over the final hump and see us through to 2018 - and hopefully into other platforms with time.\n    We cannot fully express in these pages just how grateful we are for your time in reading through our hopes and dreams for Forged of Blood. Everything we are and everything we\u2019ve developed so far has been at the largess of our friends, families, and fans who have supported us through this process. Getting this chance to share this project with you and the rest of world is something we do not take lightly. So thank you for reading, thank you for your time, and please never hesitate to reach out to us!\n- The Critical Forge Team\n     ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIndie game development is, without a doubt, a risky endeavor, and we know that there will be plenty of unforeseen challenges ahead of us as we continue to develop our game. We\u2019ve aimed high and we\u2019re shooting for the stars with Forged of Blood, that much is clear, but we believe that we have the talent and passion needed to see this project through. To that end, we have committed to fully fulfilling our budget that will see the game to completion - veritably putting the majority of the risk on us as the developers.\n\nThe biggest risk we face will be in delaying the release date. As often goes in software and game development, it is difficult to predict how everything will go and often times our gantt charts and reality don\u2019t quite match. \n\nOur second biggest risk will be the implementation of features that may be different from what we\u2019ve described; this is due to the iterative design method we have adopted to ensure the best gameplay. That means that while we may have an idea in our heads as to how a particular mechanic should work, the mechanic itself might not work as intended, be less fun than expected, or something better just comes along. When these things happen, we will adjust to make sure that the mechanics work for the betterment of the game. Things will undoubtedly change as we testplay our features rigorously, and when we open up our game to our fans in Beta, their (and your) inputs will be crucial to the final output. \n\nThat said, barring a devastating force of nature, Forged of Blood will indeed see completion.\n\nSo what does this Kickstarter campaign actually do for us? First and foremost, it will give us the breathing room to make the game the way we want it to be. We are near our personal financial limits in making sure we have budgeted for the game fully while providing the team a livable wage. The funds we raise here will allow us to expand our team and outsource work to exceed some of the limitations we\u2019ve placed on ourselves. Whether it be expanding our music and VO work, making more unique assets and features, or making the game\u2019s stories and quests even more reactive than we currently have planned, the funds we raise will allow us to truly enhance the game experience. Furthermore, with all the depth and complexities of our game, time is our biggest enemy that can only be alleviated by a larger budget, which just might relieve some of the immense pressures placed on the team.\n\nAt the end of the day, we have been truly blessed to be able to work on Forged of Blood - this is a dream come true for us as a studio and we are humbled by the process. Ultimately, our commitment is to the game and the gamers out there. With our original financial commitment to the game, we believe we have a game worthy of any Tactical RPG fan, but we know that with your help, we can make this the game that Tactical RPG fans must have.\n\nThank you for your support.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Critical Forge\nFirst created \u00b7 0 backed\nCritical Forge is a young studio with a old soul, looking to make games we grew up playing.
