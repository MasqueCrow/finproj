[{"backer": "Dread Knight", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": " Review Videos (Updating)\n#1 3D printing Nerd \n #2 WildRoseBuilds\n#3. The First Layer\n#4 Production video\n\n\n\nImagine a desktop 3D printer that can print faster than average, featuring multiple functions such as auto leveling, laser engraving and bicolor printing using simple add-ons. Plus build quality with premium materials, sleek and ergonomic design.\nNow stop imagining. LOTMAXX SC-10 SHARK is a reality.  \nLOTMAXX SC-10 SHARK is our latest and first-ever crowdfunded desktop 3D printer and we chose to launch on Kickstarter for a reason. Kickstarter is always the base of unlimited creativity. Helping to bring the creative projects to life, Kickstarter would be the proven bridge between LOTMAXX and the 3D printing community by bringing us together.\nWe believe that 3D printing has unlimited potential, and we're only just at the beginning of this emerging industry. 3D printing technology is penetrating widely and deeply across industrial, makers and consumer sectors. It's by launching on Kickstarter and connecting LOTMAXX with backers, getting feedback and conducting discussion that we can make further progress on development of 3D printing.\nWe're just getting started and your opinions matter to us. \nEstablishing ourselves in 2018, LOTMAXX is a cutting-edge technology company specializing in 3D printing. Gathered with more than 100 professionals, experienced developers and engineers from 3D printing, tablet computer and machine manufacturing industries, we've harnessed the great capability of design, research and production of 3D printing.\nWe want to vitalize the industry with our innovation. By breaking further ground in 3D printing technology, we managed to bring LOTMAXX SC-10 SHARK to Kickstarter. It's printing faster, it's more than the average desktop 3D printer.\nIt's beyond your imagination.\nPacking the Aeolus Heat Dissipation system (AHDS) and S Move System (SMS), LOTMAXX SC-10 SHARK has effectively boosted the print speed and successfully saved up to 30% average print time*. \n*Source: stats from LOTMAXX lab.   \nS Move System\nLOTMAXX SC-10 stays cool while printing, thanks to the unique and signature design of its modular nozzles.  The Aeolus Heat Dissipation system (AHDS) is a highly efficient  dissipation system with its uniquely developed four-fan design. This cools the nozzle from all angles, increasing the efficiency of heat dissipation by 42%*(measured in LOTMAXX lab) without compromising sprinting quality and print speed. LOTMAXX SC-10 SHARK has three speed modes available: normal, middle, and fast speed, to match your preference and need. Combining the high-speed motor, LOTMAXX SC-10 SHARK is a powerhouse that guarantees unparalleled speed as well as the stability.     \nThe four-fan structure\nPrinting faster\nAuto leveling, laser engraving and bicolor printing, your call. LOTMAXX SC-10 SHARK is the whole package. No need to recode and no further adjustment is required, plug and play, it's just that easy!  \nThere are 2 colors of SC-10 Shark(Deep Purple/Space Gray)\n\nLOTMAXX SC-10 SHARK comes with optional automatic bed leveling feature. The ultra-precise technology allows for 0.1mm accuracy. While the unleveled bed might cause nozzle clogging, scratch marks and poor adhesion, the auto leveling is one of the most important benefits that LOTMAXX SC-10 SHARK can offer to the quality of your prints. Just tap the touch screen to activate the auto leveling interface, the inductive sensor will probe the heated bed. It precisely measures the print surface's tilt, freeing you from the time-consuming and tricky manual process. Regardless of whether you are a newcomer or a skilled maker, you can enjoy a hassle-free auto leveling with SHARK\uff01\nNote: LOTMAXX procures 3D touch & BL touch from suppliers.\nAuto-leveling\nThe 3D Touch\nLOTMAXX SC-10 SHARK supports an optional 1.6 W laser engraving and allows you to engrave with a wide variety of materials like wood, plastic, leather, PVC, paper and resin. The interchangeable module is extremely easy to apply on. Plug and engrave, simply attach the laser engraver module next to the printhead and you're ready to witness creativity turning into reality.  \nEver so often, it's color making the artwork unique and special. While most of the 3D printers come with just one nozzle, LOTMAXX SC-10 SHARK offers optional dual color print head tier. Besides the basic option, you may choose a different package that comes with two extruders and one nozzle. Expand the possibility and upgrade your artwork, why not?\nBicolor printing\nThe last thing you want is a failed project due to a power-cut, while time and materials have also been wasted. That\u2019s why a resume printing is a must-have feature for 3D printing nowadays. LOTMAXX SC-10 SHARK can pick up the disconnection and continue with the previous printing. A tap on the touch screen will just make it right.\nPrint smoother and print smarter. Don't let the broken filament stop your artwork. The built-in filament sensor detects the filament outage quickly and stops the device wasting materials and models. Once you feed the machine new filaments, LOTMAXX SC-10 SHARK will resume the print from where it left off. \nDual gear extruder:Stable and durable.High extrusion force, ensuring smooth feeding of filament.\nPacked with an ultra-silent driver TMC2208, LOTMAXX SC-10 SHARK can reduce noise effectively. But that's not just it: pairing a super mute, highly accurate and anti-abrasive V-wheel drive on the X axis, you can still enjoy a high-quality prints with an accuracy of +0.1mm after long-run operation. \n\nDO NOT DISTURB. Just like the silent mode on mobile phones, LOTMAXX SC-10 SHARK allows for silent printing. All it takes is just one tap for the noise to melt away.\nThe 3.5-inch, highly sensitive touchscreen comes with elastic springs for added convenience. It\u2019s custom-molded to fit in hand thanks to an ergonomic design. The touchscreen allows you to control the print directly, giving instant feedback of your print job details like progress and elapsed time. \n\nMultiple language systems are common in an increasingly connected world. LOTMAXX realized it as well, that\u2019s why SHARK supports eight languages on its user interface. English, German, French, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Japanese and Chinese, SHARK has the world\u2019s most commonly used languages ready for you. \nErgonomic, extra large and designed for comfort. It\u2019s much easier to turn as it provides much larger surface area for your finger to press against. Improved and comfortable grip, a feature that complements bed leveling with ease. \nExtra large knob\nLOTMAXX SC-10 SHARK is equipped with a flexible and durable steel build plate. Either you are going to glue or remove the models, the plate is making your life easier. With the gantry powered by Anodic oxide technology, the printer is rigid and crafted with premium quality as well.

So on the occasion of the 6th anniversary, we launched this new product, we hope that through this new product, we can establish a very good relationship with the backers on  Kickstarter. We hope that they can actively participate in the research and development of our product. Of course, we are willing to accept their challenges and welcome their Suggestions. We want to build this kind of long-term, deep, and healthy interaction with them.\n\nFrom printing urgently needed medical equipment to cater to other specific needs through the use of 3D printing, this is a technology that has gained an unprecedented angle of social impact. That\u2019s why we\u2019re even more strongly committed to enabling the ease of use and affordability of this technology by developing the CR-6 SE 3D Printer and making it available to every creative mind out there.\nHarnessing the power of 3D printing shouldn\u2019t be as expensive and complicated as it has been. That\u2019s why we created Creality\u2019s CR-6 SE DIY 3D Printer, a simple and robust aluminum-built modular 3D printer that features an intelligent leveling-free system for superior accuracy and advanced 3D printing features, in an easy-to-use printer that is also affordable.\nNo complications. No special skills required. No confusion. Your CR-6 SE is ready to use out of the box. You can easily assemble it in only 5 minutes and then all you need to do is plug it in and switch it on. The CR-6 SE 3D Printer starts working and delivering amazing results\u2014whether you\u2019re a pro or a newbie\u2014in almost no time!\n\nFor the most part, accurate 3D printing is the result of a leveled bed. That\u2019s usually a challenging goal, though, because most 3D printers will present nozzle clogging, poor adhesion, and generally unleveled-related issues that compromise the quality of prints. The CR-6 SE offers precisely the opposite. Featuring an innovative true Leveling-Free Technology, this is a 3D Printer that lets you always rely on highly accurate results.\n\nNever see your creativity and productivity affected by nozzle-related replacement issues. The CR-6 SE is designed with a modular nozzle that means you can customize it. From the heat block to the nozzle tip, among other parts, this is a Modular 3D Printer that\u2019s easy to keep!\nBetter heat dissipation with unique caved heat sink\nWith its compact and reliable extruder, you know that a smoother extrusion and an easier filament feed will ultimately generate faster, quieter and smoother prints. Yes, this is what perfect 3D printing is all about!\nPhotoelectric filament sensor and flexible fixator\n\n3D printers shouldn\u2019t be annoying in the noise they make, which is why we added a Silent Chipset to the CR-6 SE. Its latest Trinamic driver helps to ensure that voltage control, fast movement and printing in silence are a given. We know: you\u2019ll thank us dearly for that!\nYou only want hot, excellent, superb printing results, right? Well, the CR-6 SE 3D Printer comes with a carborundum glass hotbed platform that is flatter than aluminum and which offers a stellar thermal performance that ensures quick heating up, strong adhesion and prints that are easy to remove.\nThe CR-6 SE 3D Printer looks as strong as it is. It also looks very stylish! This amazing work station has a beautiful design that compliments any desktop you use it on. Meanwhile, self-designed profiles and stepper motor cover prevent from filament scraps and dust. The CR-6 SE also comes with a well-arranged ribbon cable that ensures safety issues are never a concern.\nSounds like the perfect 3D printing equation, right? This unique printer is designed with a wider foundation and equipped with dual Z-axises matched with an adjustable timing belt that translates into reduced unwanted motion and improved refined results. So the stability of the machine and its performance is simply impressive.\nWeighing only 9.2kg and with manageable dimensions (442*462*540mm), the CR-6 SE is a 3D Printer that you can carry. In fact, it features a convenient removable handle that makes it easy to carry whenever you need to.\nUser experience improved by optimized details like sealed aluminum profiles, foldable filament holder, tools storage box, belt tensioner. \nToolbox\nFoldable spool holder\nAdjustable belt tensioner\nFlexible hotbed fixator\n\n\nThese are the three magic words that basically mean that your CR-6 SE will keep your printing performance running smartly and smoothly. If the machine suddenly runs out of filament or if it simply breaks, the printer\u2019s photoelectric filament sensor will instantly pick up that disruption and will stop the machine. As soon as the new filament feeds in, the CR-6 SE will resume its operation without making you lose your work.\nDid the power suddenly or accidentally go off? No worries! The CR-6 SE 3D Printer will resume printing if the power supply is interrupted. That\u2019s right\u2014you can forget about starting over because print failure is no longer an issue!\n\nThe CR-6 SE 3D Printer features a 4.3in HD Color LCD Touch Screen that allows you to easily and intuitively operate the device. Available in English and Chinese, and with a simplified and smart interface, this Touch Screen ensures that this very special printer\u2019s user experience always equates to smooth sailing!\nNo dust, Neat and Notable\nCR-6 SE revamps in quites a distinguished look. From the bottom to the top, the flat aluminum profiles makes the machine stylish and prevent from dust.\nAll-around Safety\nHassel free printing with over current protection, over-load protection, and thermal runaway protection, always keep your mind at peace.\nWhatever you think of creating and shaping, the CR-6 SE 3D Printer is the powerful, convenient and creative sidekick you need.

It almost feels as though every single event of my life was a building block for this very moment: Je suis auteur - interpr\u00e8te. C\u2019est presque comme si chaque moments de ma vie c'\u00e9tait produit dans le but d\u2019arriver \u00e0 cet instant pr\u00e9cis.\nA moment of living fully as myself, and yet it's only just the beginning. Un instant de conscience totale de moi-m\u00eame, de vivre pleinement ce que je suis, et pourtant ce n\u2019est que le d\u00e9but !\nLike all prophetesses I tell stories of hope and I encourage love above fear especially when it comes to change or transformation. Comme toutes proph\u00e9tesses, je raconte des histoires d\u2019esp\u00e9rance et j\u2019encourage la victoire de l\u2019amour sur la peur, en particulier lorsque vient le temps du changement.\nFrom Aerospace to music, yet nothing is lost because our experiences constitute a part of our profile (see personal bio). De l\u2019a\u00e9ronautique \u00e0 la musique, rien n\u2019est perdu, parce que nos exp\u00e9riences sont parties int\u00e9grantes de nous m\u00eame (conf\u00e8re biographie).\nI don't just tell of change, I am an embodiment of change!\nHi my name is Re PLICC!\nJe ne fais pas juste que de parler de changement, j\u2019incarne le changement ! \nSalut ! Je m\u2019appelle Re PLICC !\nRe PLICC\nThe Process/Le Processus\nThis is very exciting because it has granted Re the opportunity to be hands-on, to create her own team, to carry the vision & build the project from scratch. C'est vraiment g\u00e9nial parce qu'il a accord\u00e9 Re la possibilit\u00e9 d'\u00eatre cr\u00e9atrice, de monter sa propre \u00e9quipe: de construire ce projet \u00e0 partir de rien.\nThis has been wonderful start because it has been a global project; The producers in Nashville from \"The SongWriting Team\"produced the song: we worked together of course with the melody and the musical production of the song to create this new sound. A sound that supports the story! Then the song was mixed in Toulouse. And finally it was mastered by a mastering engineer from \"Blue Grotto Sound LLC\" - Sean Spence who is originally from South Africa and now lives in Nashville with his family.\nCela a \u00e9t\u00e9 merveilleux parce que ce projet est international. La chanson a \u00e9t\u00e9 produite par un professionnel \u00e0 Nashville (USA). Nous avons travaill\u00e9s ensemble sur la m\u00e9lodie et la production sonore pour cr\u00e9er ce nouveau son ! Puis la chanson a \u00e9t\u00e9 mix\u00e9e \u00e0 Toulouse (FR). Et enfin elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 masteris\u00e9e par un ing\u00e9nieur du son d'origine Sud Africaine vivant \u00e0 Nashville (USA).\nThis international collaboration of work is exactly what has made this project interesting. A team of musicians came together, which is a representation of a global network, this means we can come together and unite to produce something wonderful.\nCette collaboration internationale a rendu ce projet tr\u00e8s int\u00e9ressant. Nous pouvons tous partager cela, parce que l'\u00e9quipe qui s'est rassembl\u00e9 pour cr\u00e9er ce projet est la repr\u00e9sentation m\u00eame d'un r\u00e9seau multiculturel : Quand nous pouvons nous unir, nous pouvons nous rassembler pour produire quelque chose de merveilleux\nProduction Process\nRe PLICC's Studio Recording\nCreating The Distribution Network as an Independent artist\nRe Plicc's Distribution Approach\nThe Sound/Le Son\nGrowing up in KwaZulu Natal in South Africa; I am Zulu, so it's that Zulu drum that bits on your chest (boom boo boom boo boom boom boo boom). The hybrid - the fusion, the blending of the 2, the European sound which is pop rock sound, a sound I got accustom to when I joined the PopRock band in Toulouse. Together the two have created a new sound which I call the Re PLICC boom-bit sound and I am excited to share that with you. I am hoping that you will enjoy it and together we can create something new, a new style!\nJ'ai grandi \u00e0 Kwa-Zulu Natal en Afrique du Sud; je suis Zulu; et je transmets le son du tambour Zulu qui bats dans mon coeur (boom boo boom ...). J'ai voulu m\u00e9langer cela avec un son pop rock Europ\u00e9en, en rejoignant un groupe PopRock \u00e0 Toulouse. Ces 2 influences ont cr\u00e9e un nouveau son que j'appelle le son Re PLICC boom-bit ! Et je suis heureuse de le partager avec vous ! J'esp\u00e8re que vous l'appr\u00e9cierez et qu'ensemble nous pouvons cr\u00e9er quelque chose de nouveau... Un nouveau style !\nI believe it represents who I am, it is also something new, something which needs to find it's place in the market.\nJe pense que cela repr\u00e9sente vraiment qui je suis. Mais c'est vraiment quelque chose d'INNOVANT, quelque chose qui doit trouver sa place dans le march\u00e9.\nThe Product\nRe PLICC's first single \"A Life Of Constant Longing\" is our prototype. A song dedicated to immigration, starting anew and movement: Songs that tell stories. This is one of our slowest songs. The sound or instrumental was also created to support the story. E.g the aircraft engine sound at the beginning of the song, the center instrument -the drums, the violin to be the second voice and the pounding piano to support the drums, and others. We projected distribution for August 2015 and it was ready on time, exactly 31 July the song was ready for distribution.\nSong Lyrics: http://media.wix.com/ugd/3f3c8d_229fe6a1320743ca8e82ec957e5b5f8e.pdf\nRe PLICC's 2015 - Toulouse - Live Shows\nThe Goal /L'objectif\nThen the essence of my music is to unify humanity. To highlight that we are not that different. We are all the same! As human beings we want the same things: we want to create, we want to make a difference. We want to matter!\nL'essence m\u00eame de ma musique est d'unir l'humanit\u00e9. Pour que l'on se rende compte que nous sommes proches les uns des autres. En tant qu'humains, nous voulons la m\u00eame chose: nous voulons cr\u00e9er, nous voulons faire la diff\u00e9rence, nous voulons compter pour quelque chose.\nMy songs represent that; in the songs in which I write, I am creating a new path: humanity need a platform to say the things that they feel or to tell their story. I describe myself as a story teller and the stories in which I tell, they might be personal but sometimes they are not, it can be a story of that boy or a story of that girl.\nMes chansons repr\u00e9sentent cela; les chansons que j'\u00e9cris essayent de cr\u00e9er une nouvelle voie. Les gens ont besoin d'un moyen pour dire les choses qu'ils ressentent ou pour raconter leur histoire. Je me d\u00e9cris comme une conteuse d'histoires, et dans ces histoires que je conte, il arrive que ce soit une exp\u00e9rience personnelle mais pas toujours, cela peux \u00eatre aussi l'histoire de ce gar\u00e7on, ou bien l'histoire de cette fille...\nWe are organized, accountable and have what it takes to manage a global project, meeting every milestone! We can only improve from here, vocally, resource wise and overall performance and with your support Re and her team can achieve that. Backing this project gives you a chance to be part of something historical, a start of something new.\nLila Wallace, from the Wallace Foundation once said \"the arts belong to everyone.\u201d We need your help, so we may continue to create and to share. Together, we can Kickstart a new sound, a new style, and a new consciousness! Above that, this campaign will also build a community and promote Re PLICC's overall vision; which begins by the construction of the African calendar in February 2016; see bio for more details.\nWhen you support Re Plicc by backing this project, you ignite a flame. Below attached is the picture of the structure:\nLila Wallace, de la Wallace Foundation \u00e0 dit \u00ab L'art appartient \u00e0 tout le monde. \u00bb Nous avons besoin de votre aide, pour continuer \u00e0 cr\u00e9er et \u00e0 partager. Ensemble, nous pouvons d\u00e9marrer un nouveau son, un nouveau style et une nouvelle conscience !
