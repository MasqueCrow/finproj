Thank you in advance for understanding, please pledge responsibly.\n\nKingdom Death: Monster 1.5\nKingdom Death Monster is an massive cooperative board game about survival in a nightmare-horror world. Survivors fight for their lives against an onslaught of bizarre and fearsome creatures. They will use the fruits of these battles to build a fragile civilization in a place where humans are at the bottom of a monstrous ecology. \nInitially, I brought the concept for Monster to Kickstarter in order to make a far-away dream into a reality. The runaway train of success helped pack the game with more original art, in-depth gameplay, and fantastically sculpted minis than even I dreamed of. A game this size could not feasibly be made without the community of supportive backers we found on Kickstarter. It's too expensive to produce and too vivid for distribution.\nThrough the experience of kickstarting Monster, I found a group of people that shares my vision for a blisteringly difficult game with a continually emerging story. I am truly humbled to share it with the world.\nNow there isn't a single factory sealed copy at KD HQ. There are still people asking if there will ever be more so I'm back on Kickstarter to launch a campaign for a new edition. I want to print updated rules, great new expansions, even more content and (with your help) many surprises!!!\nKingdom Death: Monster 1.5 Changelog\nAdd-Ons\n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                         The Gambler's Chest\nGambler's Rolls\n                                                                                                                                                                                                     First Hero Expansion\nIn the First Hero Expansion, players take the role of 4 veteran survivors who have no settlement to call their own. They find and invade a settlement where they face the First Hero, a survivor so powerful, they do all the hunting by themselves! The purpose of this expansion is to help players start more advanced campaigns at Lantern Year 12 or 20. Instead of simply providing complicated rules to generate later settlements, your showdown with the First Hero will create the advanced settlement that you can take over.\n Kingdom Death: Monster\nShipping Details & Shipping Waves\nOne thing we've learned from managing the impossibly huge number of reward combinations from our first campaign is to strike a balance between timely delivery of rewards to our eager fans and being logistically responsible to our staff and partners. So here's what we've decided about shipping rewards for this campaign.\n\nWe have set the estimated delivery of all pledge levels to December 2020. This is a best case scenario, in case our campaign gets insanley huge! 3-4 years development, production & transportation cycle to 100% finish every promise we might make during this campaign is realistic.  \nRewards from this Kickstarter will ship in waves that will be determined by the final scope of this campaign. Each wave's shipping costs will be collected through a pledge manager (most likely backerkit) when the goods are ready to ship. Shipping costs will reflect the actual cost to ship your pledge and any additional rewards you selected from that wave.\nLike our previous campaign, we will make our best efforts to ease the burden of shipping by fulfilling rewards from shipping partners around the world (projected as: US, CA, EU, AU.)\nBackers are responsible for any and all import fees, VAT, duties, taxes, post office fees, and or any other fees their country or government imposes.\n\n*Core Games Ships Separately!\nThe Core Game is massive. To ensure its safety, it is being package into its own carton with corner protectors. It is too heavy to ship with other rewards. It would crush them!\nWave 1 - Estimated Delivery Summer 2017 Core Game / 1.5 Update Pack \nUnited States... $25 / $10 \nEuropean Union... $40 / $20 \nCanada... $30 / $15 Australia (+ New Zealand)... $40 / $20 \nRest of World... $100 / $30\n\nWave 2 - Estimated Delivery Winter 2017 (Still hoping for Summer 2017)\nCurrent Expansions\nUnited States... $15 + $3 per additional expansion \nEuropean Union... $15 + $3 per additional expansion\nCanada... $15 + $3 per additional expansion\nAustralia (+ New Zealand)... $15 + $3 per additional expansion  \nRest of World... $30 + $3 per additional expansion\nWave 3 - Estimated Delivery Spring 2018\nGambler's Box, Promo and cross-over figures\nUnited States... $20 + $2 per Add on\nEuropean Union... $20 + $2 per Add on\nCanada... $20 + $2 per Add on\nAustralia (+ New Zealand)... $20 + $2 per Add on\nRest of World... $30 + $2 per Add on\nWave 4 - Estimated Delivery Spring 2019 \nNew Expansions\nUnited States... $15 + $3 per additional expansion\nEuropean Union... $15 + $3 per additional expansion\nCanada... $15 + $3 per additional expansion\nAustralia (+ New Zealand)... $15 + $3 per additional expansion\nRest of World... $30 + $3 per additional expansion\nWave 5 & Beyond - Estimated Delivery Winter 2020\n???\nEven I don't know for 100% what may happen during this campaign.\nPlease note that the contents and prices of each wave are estimates and are subject to change depending on the final size of this campaign.\nPledges finalized after the pledge manager deadline passes will ship from the United States and will incur additional shipping costs and potential delays. Shipments that could not be delivered due to an inaccurately provided address (including failure to update an old address) will have additional costs to be reshipped. Due to the size of your rewards, we cannot ship to PO Boxes.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI learned a lot about manufacturing a top-quality boutique game and fulfilling it to our backers from our first Kickstarter. Not all my lessons were easy, but all of them were meaningful. Trying to bring such a staggeringly large game to life, we worked insane hours, fought lots of battles, and saw some unexpected setbacks. It's taught me how to look for ways to turn logistical, artistic, and fiscal difficulties into assets.\n\n\nI'm heading into this campaign with my eyes open. If this campaign meets with success we'll be on the hook to you guys for loads more quality content. The bigger we get, the more complex fulfillment will become. I will create a transparent, streamlined campaign from the outset and work hard to maintain the honest communication about our process and developments to make sure we meet everyone's expectations.

The game takes a few minutes to learn, it's kid-friendly, and each round takes about 20 minutes to play.\n(Stretch Goals here!)\n    THE ORIGIN STORY\n                                   I\u2019ve always wanted to make a card game. A few years ago, I started working on a game based on my comic, The Oatmeal, where you connect heads, torsos, arms, and legs to create a variety of monsters based on characters from my comic, such as the Bear-O-Dactyl. The original version of this game was doodled onto paper cutouts, and had no functioning game mechanic other than \u201cbuild funny-looking things.\u201d \nThe very first version of the Oatmeal card game.\nTwo years ago I met Elan Lee, and he showed me a prototype of a game called \u201cBombSquad,\u201d which we renamed to Exploding Kittens. After Exploding Kittens launched, my creature-building game got put on hold.\nAfter the dust from Exploding Kittens eventually settled, I asked Elan to help with the design of my monster-building game. I didn\u2019t want this to be one of those games where you're trying to \"out-comedy\" one another; I wanted it to be more of a deck-building game, such as Dominion or Hearthstone, but without all the complexity. I wanted a monster-building game you could easily play at a party.\n Up until this point, my version of the game had a big problem:  when you played, you were on autopilot. You had no decisions to make and usually one correct action to perform on every turn.  Elan has been designing physical and digital games for most of his career (he invented the genre of alternate reality games, and was formerly the creative director of the Xbox), so he put his gargantuan puzzle-solving brain to work and added a layer of much-needed complexity to the game.  He tinkered a bunch and established the basic rules of conflict, construction, and the escalation mechanic that would define the core gameplay. The tricky part was keeping this simple enough to be a party game, but complicated enough to allow for depth and strategy. It\u2019s easy to fall into two bad categories when designing tabletop games: either they\u2019re easy to learn but completely random, or they\u2019re very strategic but mind-numbingly boring. You have to walk a very thin line between the two. I think with Bears vs Babies we did that.\nOur battle-hardened \"Sharpie Deck\"\nAfter months of pestering everyone we knew to play the game with us and tweaking the rules bit by bit, we finally got it to the point where our friends pestered us to play, instead of vice versa. And that eventually brought us here, to Kickstarter, where we\u2019re now pestering the whole internet to play with us.\nAnd so here we are. \nLet the bear hugs and baby burping begin.\n-Matt and Elan\n----------\n   ----------\n                                                                                 Press Inquiries\nEmail: info@bearsvsbabies.com\n----------", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRemember that one time two years ago when we built Exploding Kittens and shipped everything we promised to you ON TIME?\n\nSeems like a pretty keen idea to try that again.

We don't use a pledge manager\u2014backers may NOT increase their pledge or add on more items at the KS prices after the campaign ends. Future pre-orders and add-ons can be made on our website.\nDesigned by Jamey Stegmaier (Viticulture & Euphoria) and based on the art and worldbuilding of Jakub Rozalski, Scythe is a 4x game (explore, expand, exploit, exterminate) set in an alternate-history, 1920s Eastern Europe. Scythe tells the stories of 5 factions competing over an unclaimed patch of land surrounding the mysterious Factory.\nDuring Scythe's 750+ blind playtests, the playtesters consistently said they most enjoyed:\nthe dual benefits of the upgrade system (increase an action benefit and decrease a cost)\nthe distinctly different faction and mech abilities\nthe thematic choices presented by the encounter cards\nthe asymmetry and variability created by random pairings of faction and player mats\nthe twist to area control due to all resources being kept on the board\nCheck out the Scythe rules and playtest print-and-play files to see how Scythe blends an engine-building system inspired by Terra Mystica with a deterministic combat system influenced by Kemet. Renders of the 25 miniatures in Scythe are below the \"What's in the Box?\" image.\nTo add items onto your pledge, manually add the $ amount during the project. We don't use a pledge manager, so all pledges must be made in full by November 5. You can mix and match up to 3 total games (any version) and any number of add-ons. On the post-project survey, you will tell us the various items that comprise your pledge.\nEach player is represented on the board by a character and their animal companion (1 miniature). Each character miniature has a 25mm base and a height of 36-58mm.\nEach faction has 4 mechs in their faction color that can be deployed during the game. Each mech miniature has a 30mm base and a height of 26-36mm.\nThis is an example of a faction mat (the Rusviet faction). This shows your faction's special ability, starting military strength, mech abilities, and one-time recruit benefits.\n                                                                                                                                                        This is an example of a player mat (\"Patriotic\"). Each player mat is divided into four sections, each with a top-row action and a bottom-row action. Your actions improve as you build your economic engine.\nThe highly detailed game board for Scythe (full board on left, sample territory on right) depicts the areas near the mysterious Factory. This is a fully-formed world with a specific story, so the board is not modular (see FAQ for more details).\n                                             All promo items are included in every Kickstarter game for free and will be available for additional cost post-Kickstarter (there is no Kickstarter-exclusive content).

We'll even pay for return shipping.\nThe Factory promo pack contains 6 extra Factory cards for Kickstarter backers. The promo pack will be available for an additional cost to those who discover Scythe after the Kickstarter campaign.\nIt may not be these exact Factory cards that end up in the promo pack.\nThe custom metal coins  (80 total) featured in the Premium, Collector's, and Art Connoisseur Edition games were designed specifically for Scythe. The set of coins is available for order by itself on the Stonemaier Games website for $25 (+ shipping) or as an add-on to any copy of the game for $22.\nThe plastic resource containers (4 total) in the Premium, Collector's, and Art Connoisseur Edition games allow for easy storage, setup, and distribution of the various tokens and coins in Scythe. There's room for exactly 4 of these containers in the Scythe box.\nPlastic container with coin prototypes.\nThe board extension in the Collector's and Art Connoisseur Editions slides next to the back side of the game board, creating a complete board with +50% bigger hexes (the content is the same; see Update 3). All units and resources in Scythe are kept on the board, so the larger hexes provide more space.\nThe game board is 624x818mm, and it grows to 818x936mm with the extension. It is available as an add-on to any copy of the game for $10 (every game board is double-sided) and will be available to order from our website by itself for $12 (+ shipping) after the project ends.\nThe realistic resource tokens (made out of resin or zinc) in the Collector's and Art Connoisseur Editions replace the wooden resource tokens (there are no wooden resource tokens in those editions). They include 80 tokens (20 each) for food, metal, oil, and wood. These tokens are available in our treasure chests (one in each chest), as well as in an add-on to any copy of the game for $21.\nThe individually-numbered boxes in the Collector's and Art Connoisseur Editions are randomly assigned. The limit of these boxes will be determined by the total number of backers at those levels.\nThe art book included with the Art Connoisseur Edition is a 100-page, full-color, hardback collection of the art featured in Scythe, as well as other pieces in Jakub Rozalski's acclaimed 1920s series. The book will measure approximately 250x290mm. It's available for pre-order by itself on the Stonemaier Games website for $25 (+ shipping) or as an add-on to any copy of the game for $23. The art book will be packed externally from the game box.\nThe wooden resource tokens aren't in the Collector's and Art Connoisseur Editions, so if you want both one of those games and wooden resources (or if you just want extra resources with any version of Scythe), please add $10 to your pledge. This is for an external pack of 20 food/grain, 20 metal, 20 wood, and 20 oil tokens.\nSamples on the left; final colors on the right.\nWe ship games in bulk to fulfillment centers around the world to reduce customs fees & VAT and to keep shipping prices low (this method is explained here; country codes are here).\nBackers are limited to 3 total games per pledge (a mix of any 3 versions of the game is fine; only pay the shipping fee once per pledge, not once per game). To add more games beyond the first (or add-ons), manually enter the $ total when making your pledge or click the blue \"Manage\" button next to a previously made pledge.\nAn example of an encounter card. When your character reaches certain parts of the board, they encounter a situation that gives you a choice of one of the three options.\nWe like to support game stores around the world by offering the special Kickstarter versions of the game to retailers during the campaign. We treat retailer backers just like other backers in that they receive their rewards before we release regular retail games into distribution.\nIf you're a retailer, please contact Jamey at stonemaiergames@gmail.com during the campaign for pricing information. After the campaign, you can reserve retail copies of Scythe by contacting our distribution broker: paul@greaterthangames.com\nAn example of an objective card. Each player receives 2 objectives at the beginning of the game and can complete one of them as a goal.\nJamey Stegmaier is the designer of Scythe, Viticulture, Tuscany, and Euphoria. He's also the co-founder and president of Stonemaier Games, and he's written a book about crowdfunding.\nJakub Rozalski is the artist, worldbuilder, and creative director of Scythe.

Chandler, and features original Scythe music composed by Micha\u0142 Wo\u017aniak. The gif explaining the board extension was designed by Bryce Walter and reduced in size for faster loading times by Bruce Alcorn.\nPlaytesters: The development process for Scythe featured over 750 blind playtests and 628 individual playtesters. We owe a huge debt of gratitude to all of them, especially to Barry Schmaling (who built the playtester forum) and all of the lead playtesters. They had a lot to say about Scythe, but here are a few of our favorite quotes:\n\u201cFarm your little piece of the world, spread out and colonise as much as you can, or rampage with mechs projecting lethal force over your opponents. This game has it all and with so many routes to victory, no two games are the same.\u201d \u2014 Stephen \u2018Azrael\u2019 Ogden\n\u201cScythe is an excellent blend of resource management and conflict which also manages to leave you with a delightful sense of having told a story.\" \u2014 Andrew Busam\n\u201cThe Automa is challenging, relentless, and at times unforgiving, but it's also a whole lot of fun. It's a worthy adversary that earns a begrudging respect.\u201d \u2014 Jeremiah Power\nWhile we don't offer existing inventory or unrelated products as add-ons through Kickstarter, we offer other Stonemaier products on our website. These items will ship right away and cannot be held until Scythe ships.\nViticulture, Tuscany, Euphoria, Between Two Cities, and our treasure chests are also available from your friendly local game store.\nJamey's book, A Crowdfunder's Strategy Guide: Build a Better Business by Building Community, is available in a number of online and offline locations.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThrough Stonemaier Games, Jamey Stegmaier has raised over $1.4 million on Kickstarter and has delivered over 20,000 individual rewards to backers within a few months of the estimated delivery date (most are on time or early). He is an avid backer and gamer, and his book about crowdfunding was published in September 2015: http://stonemaiergames.com/kickstarter/book/\n\nHowever, Scythe presented three specific new challenges: miniatures, shipping, and balance.\n\nThis is our first time working with plastic miniatures. We had heard horror stories about other projects involving miniatures, and we've experienced a few as backers. So we wanted to start early to avoid some of the delays that can occur as the result of miniatures. We started working with Jakub and his 3D modelers in March, using Shapeways to print each version of the sculpts to see how they worked on the game board. We also worked closely with Panda's team throughout the process to make sure the sculpts are feasible and durable. We've created the molds for the miniatures and are ready for production.\n\nWe've picked up and dropped fulfillment partners over time, keeping those who pack our games well and excel at communication. Because shipping is particularly important for Scythe\u2014a big game with a box that we want delivered in pristine condition\u2014we tested out two new-to-us fulfillment partners (Funagain in the US and Snakes & Lattes in Canada) on our previous project in preparation for Scythe. We add those two to Ideaspatcher in Europe, Good Games in Australia, and Agility in China, all three of which we've worked on in the past and have had excellent results.\n\nOne of the main features of Scythe's gameplay is asymmetry between factions. It's tough to balance an asymmetric game, so after we got Scythe to a good place with local playtesters, we ran 3 different waves of multi-player blind playtesting and 2 waves of solo blind playtesting. The huge amount of anecdotal and quantitative data we collected as a result helped us ensure that Scythe is extremely well balanced (and fun!).\n\nIf you would like to know more about what we learned from our Kickstarter experiences and research, go to http://stonemaiergames.com/kickstarter/full-list-chronological/ to see 160+ Kickstarter Lessons to help you create a successful project too.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #46", "update_userinfo": "Introducing the Scythe Modular Board", "update_content": "Hi!

You\u2019re Jack Nimble: Jack rabbit, lumberjack. You and your best friend, Enessa, have teamed up to steal the barrel. Now it\u2019s up to you to stop the Bugs from unleashing Pure Boredom upon the world in Jack Nimble: Attack of the Boredom Bugs for PC, Mac, and Linux.\nA new puzzle game genre called Active Tower Defense (\"ATD\"), where each tower will only activate if you manually control it.\nPlay musical instruments to summon 3 different tower animals: an armadillo, a porcupine, or an owl -- each with a unique perspective and mini-game.\nCombine the view-shifting powers of each tower to solve the puzzle.\nGo on a whimsical adventure as you assemble a cast of quirky creatures who teach you the many ways to defeat Boredom.\nDownload the free demo now available for Mac, PC, or Linux.\nBeau Kittredge, formerly known as a children's book author and a ultimate frisbee MVP is the recent founder of Snowsuit Studio. He came up with the idea after becoming outraged at the low quality of attacks coming from one of the towers in a popular tower defense game. Yelling very harsh words at the tower, he said, \u201cIf I was in the game, I would run over, grab the bow from the archer, and do it myself.\u201d Then he imagined himself running from tower to tower making swift work of the bad guys. Beau also wanted to incorporate view shifting puzzles so that the player has to think spatially and plan accordingly. Fast forward to now: We have created a game where you must assess the situation, summon the right towers, and then use skill to complete the task at paw. It\u2019s completely up to you to save the day!\nFrom the Blues Galaxy, the Boredom Bugs have landed in Watercolor Woods. They\u2019ve brought one Barrel of Pure Boredom, which they intend to break open and turn the animals of Watercolor Woods into a complacent crop of bored beings. Thankfully for the Watercolor Woods, you, Jack Nimble, and your best friend Enessa the elephant have stolen the Barrel. Now you must go on an adventure to safely dispose of the Barrel of Pure Boredom and learn the many ways to keep the Boredom Bugs from opening it. You will assemble the most amazing Boredom fighters on your journey, such as the arctic unicorn who can freeze Boredom Bugs.\nJack is always slightly cold, so he wears a warm red hat. His insatiable appetite for learning is quenched by a persistent pursuit of hobbies. Now all of his skills will be put to the test, since he must stop the Boredom Bugs from breaking open the Barrel of Pure Boredom.\n\nSmart and sturdy, Enessa is the only one strong enough to carry the Barrel of Pure Boredom and the only one patient enough to keep Jack on task. She loves dancing and taking long baths.\n ALSO KNOWN AS THE TOWER ANIMALS\nTOWER UPGRADES: These will play a major role in defeating Boredom Bugs. Each of the above tower animals will get three upgrades the will significantly help them. Here are some examples.\nArmadillos first upgrade allows them to turn into Boredom Buzzsaws. \nPorcupines first upgrade is pulling out quills and throwing them forward. \nOwls first upgrade is watermelon and we all know what that means. :) \nAllows us the full creative freedom to shape a new type of game. \nAvoids having a big publisher tell us to follow a familiar formula.\nBackers will decide how awesome the game will be: You will help us define the scope of the project.\nSuper Special Thanks!\nAnita: Character portraits.

So we made some new ones... (see below)\nWith us hitting the original high goal with two entire days remaining, we have no choice but to offer you Over-Stretch Goals...\nLet's knock these 3 Over-Stretchers out.\n1 Down - 2 to go!\nLook for Frozen Tundra & Gamma Dice in Halfsies 2.0 in mid 2015.\n\"Why the increase in the pricing curve in the Over-Stretch Goals?\"\nThe original campaign was designed and budgeted around shipping up to 9 sets.  Beyond that our shipping costs take a turn for the worse (something we've chosen to help mitigate for you beyond 9 sets).  Unlocking more sets also reflects a larger number of backers, which in turn demands higher production runs for some, and eventually all, of the colors.  In order to cover our increased production and shipping costs, we need to take the curve up a notch.  We kinda wrote the book on Kickstarter budgeting, and promise you that these exciting Over-Stretch Goals are budgeted both accurately and honestly.\nThanks for pledging!\nLet's do this!\nA quick FAQ note about A.D.A.P.T.\nA.D.A.P.T. is our newest game, and our next release.  It is a strategic battle card game for 2-3 players, that has never before seen mechanics (that's the way we like to do things), and is a total blast as you forcibly adapt your Guppy into a Master Fish with all manner of fun fish (and not-so-fish) parts.  The PnP takes about 5 minutes to print and set up; the rules take about 8 minutes to read, and the whole thing will cost you less than $1.50 print (if that).  It's a fun way to be the first to playtest our newest game, and maybe even offer feedback.  Heck! You've already helped design some of the Fish and Parts we'll flavor the game with. : ) \nOh, and p.s.... the big secret is... It requires a full set of dice to play! ; O\nHalfsies Dice are all new full dice sets that feature a beautiful new half-&-half color-split design, have a pearlescent swirl within each color, and are semi-translucent for stunningly vibrant colors.  \nAesthetically pleasing, and professionally manufactured these dice are a perfect addition to any collection.\nDice Details\nHalfsies Dice are manufactured in high impact resin with smooth corners, on preexisting, industry standard dice molds for a clean and reliably-balanced roll every time.\nHalfsies Dice have been prototyped in a number of color sets for you to see, but can and will be designed in any color arrangement you can imagine.\nAll sets are complete, the industry standard 15-20mm by die, and include the standard 7 dice:\n*backer favorite renders shown - full sets will be all the same colors\nThese dice sets fit perfectly in any collection, whether you are a casual gamer, a dice collector, or just like shiny objects.\n\"These are your dice.\"\nHere are some dice closeups so you can compare what you have at home to what Halfsies Dice look like.  These are our prototypes, but you'll decide which colors get made.\nI think you'll be pleased with the all new half-&-half split design...\nThe brightness that semi-translucence brings...\n The specificity and range of colors that can be chosen...\nThe vibrancy of the colors that can be chosen...\nAnd the stop-in-your-tracks beauty of the pearlescent swirl...\n More close up pics of the dice - now here.\nWhat about Price?\nShipping is included on all USA orders, and dirt cheap internationally, thus making them as cheap or cheaper than all other multi-color dice sets on the market.\nPlus we're a little guy, so we appreciate your support.\nTo get things started, we've designed the first 3 color sets after the greatest fantasy metals of legend.  After that, you choose the rest!\nSet #1) Mithril\nMithril Lore - A legendary metal first mined by the dwarves of Moria.  Some say it is actually an organic metal that can be found forming the scales of certain dragons. Beautiful and engaging, these silvery blue dice make a great companion for any noble gamer.\nSet #2) Orichalcum\nOrichalcum Lore - A rare red metal found only in the sunken city of Atlantis.  Its strength and molecular commonalities with gold made it abundantly valuable.  Bold and strong, this set can roll with the best of them in any dungeon crawl campaign.\nSet #3) Adamantium\nAdamantium Lore - Once known as the indestructible metal Adamantine that held the Greek titans captive in the underworld.  Now, its popular alloy has been used to create some pretty sweet claws.  These gentle green hues will soothe your mind whilst your ranger puts out long range DPS.\nThe color arrangements for the next 5 ...er, make that EIGHT... dice sets will be chosen by YOU, and unlocked by Stretch & Over-Stretch Goals.\nSet #4) The backer chosen: Psionic Combat - Now Available!\nPsionic Combat Lore - In the world of fantasy and legendary heroes there are those that can manipulate reality by sheer force of will. Such heroes may battle one another across the infinite and colorful worlds of their imaginations. The victor emerges physically exhausted, the victim is lost to a coma. This is Psionic Combat!\nSet #5) The backer chosen: Magma Dice - Now Available!\nMagma Dice Lore - Magma is a mix of molten rock, crystals, and gas found deep beneath the surface of the earth, burning as hot as 2400 degrees Fahrenheit (1300 \u00b0C). Under certain circumstances magma will cool beneath the surface forming crystalline igneous rocks. \u2026add a little gold paint, and you've got Magma Dice!\nSet #6) The backer chosen: Moonlight Sonata - Now Available!\nMoonlight Sonata Dice Lore - Every rare once in a while an asteroid strikes the surface of the moon sending moon rocks hurling toward earth.  As they catch a glint of sunlight upon entering our atmosphere, they begin to hum a sound that, together, is almost musical.  We call this, the Moonlight Sonata.\nSet #7) The backer chosen: Treant Dice - Now Available!\nTreant Dice Lore - The ents are trees so old that they've developed consciousnesses of their own.  The drawback to this state is that they can no longer beget new trees; they produce seeds, but those seeds can't germinate as they too have a consciousnesses of their own.  These are your Treant Dice.\nSet #8) The backer chosen: The Heir -Now Available!\nThe Heir Lore - On March 17th 2014, The Heir was discovered.  On November 23rd 2015, 2014, The Heir was born.  On February 12th 2015, The Heir had dice named after him.  On March 19th 2015 The Heir chose shared his dice with everyone. \nClose-up of The Heir's official prototype.\n(Shows the quality and beauty that all dice will be produced with.)\nThese dice won for a reason!\nSet #9) The Legendary Yin Yang Set - We did it! - Now Available!\nNow unlocked, Yin Yang Dice Sets can be added to any Pledge Tier for just $7 each, no limit!\nYin Yang Lore - Light is more powerful than darkness, for no amount of darkness can snuff out light, but still the two exist at the same time.  The traditional Yin Yang is a visual representation of balance... like these dice... balanced!\nSet #10) The backer chosen: Nanobots - Now Available!\nNanobot Lore - Small microbots made to function like living cells but based entirely on their own A.I. - If you can reprogram them, or just get them to like you, they'll roll whatever you want!\nSet #11) The backer chosen: Frozen Tundra! - Available at the $100,000 Over-Stretch Goal.\nFrozen Tundra Lore - These special dice are actually hail from the frozen polar ice caps of the North & South Poles that fell thousands of years ago against the barren earth.  Now dug up, they have a half-life of 1,000 more years before they melt again.  Get and use them while you still can!\nThe FINAL Set #12) The backer chosen: Gamma Dice! - Available at the $120,000 Over-Stretch Goal!\nGamma Dice Lore - These amazing dice were once normal ordinary dice.  But after a terrible incident with gamma radiation.... they're now Incredible!\nGamma Dice will make a grand re-appearance in Halfsies Dice 2.0 in mid 2015.

Older color sets that are removed may return later, so hang tight if your favorite disappears for a while, and be sure to let us know in the comments that you want it back.\nCampaigning for your favorite color sets in the comments is highly encouraged.\nThe Color Sets available for the Final round of voting (as of 3/21/15) are:\nThe link to the survey is just below the list of options.\nTake a new look at some new up-close pics of some the dice!\nSelect the most recent survey below to place your vote for the next dice color set.\nSurvey for Dice Set #4 - Completed - Open to everyone\nSurvey for Dice Set #5 - Completed - Inside Backer Only Update #6\nSurvey for Dice Set #6 - Completed - Inside Backer Only Update #9\nSurvey for Dice Set #7 - Completed - Inside Backer Only Update #14\nSurvey for Dice Set #8 - Completed - Inside Backer Only Update #18\nSurvey for Dice Set #10! - Completed - Open to all in Update #21\nTie Breaker Survey for Set #10 - Completed - In Update #22\nSurvey for Dice Set #11 - Completed - Inside Update #24\nTie Breaker Survey for Set #11 - Completed - In Update #25\nSurvey for Final Dice Set #12! - Completed - In Update #26\nAll surveys closed at the end of the Campaign.  Though we welcome you to view the updates to see the results.\n1) We need your help. \nAs big fans & collectors of various dice sets ourselves, we invented this new half & half design to honor a promise made to our The King's Armory Backers and to bring a brand new style of dice to the tabletop.  We have even begun prototyping them to ensure the idea would work.  Successful in prototyping, these dice can become a reality - with your help.\nPlus by backing, you'll have access to participate in the Backer-Only Dice Selection Surveys.\n2) Our motto is \"This is your game\", and is so for a reason.\nIf you followed our first campaign, you know that A) We love your involvement, B) We believe in transparency, and C) We have a tendency to give away free stuff.\nInvolvement: The majority of dice sets (sets #4-8) will be chosen by Backer Vote.  Sure, we could pick them all ourselves, but that's not the way we roll.\nTransparency: All Pledge Tiers are already displayed and available from the start.  No mysteries about pricing as the campaign progresses.  We even posted our budget in the FAQs at the bottom of the page, and have reduced international shipping costs 3 times over the course of the campaign.\nFree Stuff: We've added a \"Better the Odds\" Tier, in which you put your faith in this campaign to see ALL Dice Sets unlocked, bettering everyone's odds of unlocking Stretch Goals, and we in turn give you the Yin Yang Dice Set for FREE when we hit that point.  Plus the Saint Patrick's Day Tiers, now the Gift Package Tier!  Free stuff!  ...we're kinda obsessed with free upgrades. \n3) These dice are the lowest prices they'll ever be.\nWe have priced the Tiers as low as we can to make them accessible to everyone, while still guaranteeing successful production & delivery.\nIn retail, these dice will MSRP at $9+ per set + full price shipping.\nHere on Kickstarter you can get them for as low as $7.00 (or less) per set!\nFor designer 2-tone dice, that price can't be found anywhere online.\nDetails and a little math:\nEven at the first Tier, since shipping is included in your order (USA full; International in-part), they are already cheaper than ordering retail from most online retailers (because they charge full shipping in addition).  And these dice get less expensive per set with each Pledge Tier. \nPricing by Tier:\n1 Set Tier - $12.00\n2 sets tier - $11.50 per set\n3 Sets Tier - $11.00 per set\n4 Sets Tier - $9.75 per set\n5 Sets Tier - $8.80 per set\n6 Sets Tier - $8.17 per set\n7 Sets Tier - $7.71 per set\n8 Sets Tier - $7.38 per set\n9 Sets Tier - $7.33 per set (Booyaa!)\n10 Sets Tier - $7.30 per set\n11 Sets Tier - $7.27 per set\n12 Sets Tier - $7.25 per set (Booyaa!)\n**18** Sets Tier - $7.17 per set\n**27** Sets Tier - $7.00 per set\n**34+2** Sets Tier - $6.61 per set - Tier now available\nAt the \"6 Sets Tier\" the price per set is notably less than other designer 2-color dice available online.  ...even after International Shipping.  And it only gets cheaper as you add more!\nA quick check:\nCommon online retail pricing: $9.95 x 9 sets = $89.55. \nPlus $5-25 shipping = Total: $94.55 - $114.55\nThis Kickstarter: $7.33 x 9 sets = $66.00.\nPlus our max of $23 Shipping = Total: $89.00 \u2026to anywhere in the world ...at max!\nCompare these prices with any online retailer of specialty 2-tone dice.  We think you'll be rather pleased.\nHow are we able to do this?  We kicked this with zero margin on these dice.  We've offered up our profits for your savings.  We'll make a couple bucks selling the left overs after the campaign.  But you get them crazy cheap for investing your trust in us.  That's the way we do things.\nStill unsure? \nWe invite you to back us at the lowest Pledge Tier so you can join in the comments, surveys, and updates to see we do things.  If at the end of all things you're not happy with your time with us, simply cancel your pledge.  You have nothing to lose. \nJust give us the chance to wow you.\nEach Pledge Tier represents a quantity of Dice Sets.  The more sets ordered in a single pledge the less each Dice Set costs.\nAll Tiers include: A number of Dice Sets in plastic dice cases, a shipping subsidy, and entry to Backer-only voting.\nFinal color choices for your order will be made after the campaign closes, at all Tiers.  Pledge early, choose later.\n\n\"Can I order multiples of certain color sets, so this campaign hits all its goals?\"\nAbsolutely!  To do so...\nClick the green \"Back this Project\" button at the top of the page.\nSelect the Pledge Tier that corresponds to the total number of sets you'd like to receive.\nGo tell your friends about these dice, so they can pledge too.\nAt the close of the campaign, simply tell us what color sets you desire; repeats welcome.\nAll shipping charges will be collected after the campaign.\nWe chose the \"pay for shipping after the campaign\" method because it keeps the Funding Goal & Stretch Goals more transparent & accurate, while it also reduces your final shipping charges. \nWe just hacked down International Shipping CONSIDERABLY... again. (3/7/15)\nShipping costs - detailed by quantity of sets ordered, by area.\n\u2020 = \"Friendly Shipping\" with VAT & Customs Fees pre-paid.\n\u2021 = Yes, we managed to successfully unify ALL OF EUROPE, Western, Central, and even Non-EU, etc. for shipping rates.  EU Europe is also \"Friendly\"; while non-EU Europe may be subject to VAT by locality.\n* As we have successfully reached $69,000 in funding.  These prices are locked in.  Congratulations!\nPlease DO NOT add the shipping rate to your pledge. \nShipping will be collected after the campaign during Pledge Management.  Because...\nWe continue our pledge: If we find prices less than the ones we've already quoted, we will reduce the shipping accordingly.  It's already happened THRICE so far...\nUPDATE: International Shipping rates reduced as of 2/18/15\nUPDATE: International Shipping rates reduced further as of 2/28/15\nUPDATE: International Shipping rates reduced HUGELY as of 3/7/15\nShipping Q&A:\n\"International Shipping got cheaper with each Stretch Goal?\"\nPer set, yes. We budgeted in a sliding scale for shipping subsidies within our Funding & Stretch Goals, so that we could guarantee that USA shipping remains free with every unlocked Tier.  As the USA subsidy grew, so did the international one.  That means, the higher our funding goal grew, the less international Backers have to pay, on average, for shipping!\n-\n...the lost prototypes...\nPLAY", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nHaving already begun manufacturing on The King's Armory - The Tower Defense Board Game, we have gained a lot of experience with game production - including custom polyhedral dice - and we put that experience to work reducing the risks and challenges. \nIt also allows us to foresee potential issues, and solve them in advance.\n\nFor example: we can't be 100% certain what final International Shipping is going to cost for each Backer's unique order, so we did extensive research with multiple companies in order to provide very accurate estimates, and ultimately chose to collect shipping post-campaign. This way there's no \"we ran out of money for shipping\" faux pas, because each person pays what they owe by order and by region.\n\nOur Commitment to Your Excellence: \nIf you get the wrong dice, experience excessive production delays, or are in any way dissatisfied with the way we fulfill your pledge, whether it be our fault or any others', we'll fight on your behalf to make it right. We've done it for our TKA Backers, and we'll do it again for you.\nAnd if we can't make it right, we'll refund your money; thus mitigating YOUR risks and challenges.\n\nGiving Back to Those That Have Helped Us: \nOur experience with game production during The King's Armory campaign really has taught us a lot.

If you discover the game after the project ends, you can order the retail version of the game (it\u2019s the same version you see here with all stretch goals) on the Stonemaier Games website.\nThe creators of Viticulture and Euphoria bring you Between Two Cities, a partnership-driven, tile-drafting, competitive city-building game that 1-7 players can play in 20-25 minutes.\nDesigned by Ben Rosset and Matthew O'Malley and developed by Jamey Stegmaier, Between Two Cities caught the attention of Stonemaier Games thanks to the unique intersection between cooperative play (build cities with 2 partners) and competitive play (only 1 winner).\nYou can experience the way Between Two Cities blends the gameplay of 7 Wonders, Carcassonne, Alhambra, and Among the Stars by checking out the rules and the free playtest version of the print-and-play files.\nThe 6 tile types in the game: Shop, Park, House, Office, Tavern, and Factory.\nBetween Two Cities is a complete game with a full set of linen-embossed tiles and custom wooden tokens, but we have some stretch goals to help make the game experience even better!\nAll stretch goals are fully playtested (see photos of some of our amazing playtesters below) and will be included in every copy of Between Two Cities (Kickstarter and retail).\nClick here for the rules and the free playtest version of the print-and-play files. Between Two Cities has been playtested by over 250 people and is almost production-ready.\nFind all media mentions and reviews of Between Two Cities on our website and join the discussion about the game on BoardGameGeek.\nBoard Game Quest preview\nGeekDad review\nTheology of Games review\nBoard Gamers Anonymous review (podcast and written review)\nFather Geek review\nE&E's Spellenmolen (Dutch review)\nNVS Gameplays\nMoney-Back Guarantee: If you decide you don't like Between Two Cities within 1 month of receiving it, you can return it for a full pledge refund. We'll even pay for shipping.\nLimited Availability: We don't do Kickstarter exclusive items, but we'll only print a limited number of the special edition as based on the final pledge totals.\nMake It Better for Everyone: The more stretch goals we reach, the more enhanced and beautiful the game will be! \nWe Listen: We treat backers as collaborators--we truly value your input as we put the finishing touches on the game, and we promptly address all questions and ideas.\nLocalized Shipping: Our shipping fees for Kickstarted games are so low because we send games in bulk to fulfillment centers around the world. This is your chance to lock in the lowest possible shipping rate.\nBackers Come First: You'll get your copy of Between Two Cities well before it enters traditional distribution channels. Remember that retailers can be backers too!\nWe Need You: We've covered the cost of graphic design, art, and development for Between Two Cities, but we can't manufacture and ship the game without your support.\nA few of the 250+ playtesters who helped us along the way.\nWe ship games in bulk to fulfillment centers around the world to eliminate customs fees & VAT and to keep shipping prices low (this method is explained here; country codes are here).\nBackers are limited to 3 total copies per pledge, as that's the number that can fit inside a shipping carton with proper packaging. For additional copies, you can pledge under a different Kickstarter account.\nBetween Two Cities is played in three rounds. In each round, you'll start with a fresh hand of tiles. Select two of those tiles, passing the rest to the player on your left or right (depends on the round). Place one of those tiles in the city on your left and one in the city on your right, then pick up the hand that was passed to you and repeat the process.\nThe middle round actually involves drawing 3 rectangular \"duplex\" tiles (two building tiles side by side in a vertical or horizontal configuration) and selecting 2 of them--there is no drafting in this round.\nAfter all three rounds, you will have built a 4x4 city on your left and a 4x4 city on your right. Add up the scores for all cities, but only compare your lowest scoring city to each other player's lowest-scoring city to determine the winner.\nEach of the tiles (art shown below) scores in the following way. The final tiles have scoring reminders below the art:\nShop (yellow): The more shops you have in a row or column, the higher the score.\nPark (green): Each group of adjacent parks score an ascending amount of points based on the number park tiles in the group.\nHouse (brown): Each house scores a point for each other tile type in the city (they want variety).\nOffice (blue): The more offices, the better. If they're next to at least 1 Tavern, they score a bonus point.\nTavern (red): There are 4 types of taverns (different icons)--you want to get as many sets of different tavern types as possible.\nFactory (gray): The cities with the most factories score more points per factory than other cities.\nThe game includes a head-to-head 2-player variant that removes the partnership mechanism but increases the impact of the tiles you choose to pass (or not pass) to your opponent. \nClick here for the rules and the free playtest version of the print-and-play files.\nThe special edition of Between Two Cities features a limited-run version of the game. The game itself is the same, but the box will be embossed in gold foil highlights and will be stamped with a number unique to your copy of the game (e.g., \"1287 / 4000\"). The special edition also includes rules in French and German (in addition to English rules).\nThe special edition will also include 7 additional pairs of city tokens. When we were designing the city tokens, we designed 14 of them and had e-newsletter subscribers vote on their favorites. The top 7 were selected for the retail game, but we liked the other 7 so much that we decided to include them in the special edition for extra flavor. They do not expand the game past 7 players or impact the gameplay in any way.\nIn addition to the standard city tokens, the special edition also includes the Arc de Triomphe, US Capitol, Brandenburg Gate, St. Basil's, Big Ben, the White House, and the Forbidden City. Each token in the final version will be a unique color.\nOne of the exciting aspects of designing a complete core game is you generate a lot of ideas for expansions. We look forward to discussing these possibilities with backers during and after the Kickstarter campaign to see the types of expansions they're the most excited about. These are the two styles of expansions we're considering:\nVertical: These would expand upon the base game, allowing players to develop their cities through the ages by adding more rounds and new tile types.\nHorizontal: These would take the core mechanisms of the game and translate them to other themes, like Between Two Castles, Planets, Dystopias, etc.\nWe like to support game stores around the world by offering the special Kickstarter versions of our game to retailers during the campaign.

Thanks!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nBetween Two Cities is a first for us in that it's the first game published by Stonemaier Games that wasn't designed by Jamey Stegmaier--rather, it's from designers Ben Rosset and Matthew O'Malley. Jamey served as the game's developer, honing it, balancing it, and trying to make sure that every decision is fun and interesting. This process was made easy by the designers' willingness to hear and test new ideas.\n\nDuring the evolution of Stonemaier Games, we've learned the importance of blind playtesting (having people learn the game from the rulebook and test the game away from the designers). We've been fortunate to have hundreds of Stonemaier Ambassadors and their friends volunteer to playtest our games so as to make them as good as possible for the first print run. We've also learned the value of having checks and balances at every step in the production process, but when we do mess up, we go above and beyond to remedy the error.\n\nStonemaier Games established an advisory board of industry veterans in January '13 to help us mitigate risks and challenges. So even though we will surely face new challenges in the future, we have an incredible team of experienced advisers to point us in the right direction. We also work with Panda Game Manufacturing to produce the game, a company with a wealth of knowledge and experience.\n\nStonemaier Games has delivered all of our Kickstarter rewards from 4 projects within a few months of the estimated delivery date, sometimes even early. However, we seek to continue to improve that process to keep shipping rates low, deliver quickly, and ensure that the games arrive in perfect condition. We've learned that shipments sent from China to Australia need fumigation certificates for wooden components and that products shipped anywhere need \"Made in China\" clearly listed on the exterior of every product for them to clear customs. In short, we've made mistakes, and not only have we learned from them, we've shared them transparently with backers and on our blog to help other creators.\n\nIf you would like to know more about what we learned from our Kickstarter experiences and research, go to www.stonemaiergames.com to see 100+ Kickstarter Lessons to help you create a successful project too.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #29", "update_userinfo": "Between Two Cities: Capitals Release Day!", "update_content": "Today is a special day.

Along with a Narrator, these players take their characters through fantastical worlds while they interact with interesting people, delve into dangerous, action packed plot lines and (hopefully) come out the hero (or villain if they choose). Dice are used to decide outcomes where random chance is involved but in most cases the players choose what they want their characters to do and the Narrator decides what happens. At the end of the game everyone will have taken their part in telling the story and their characters can continue their journey in the next session as they learn, grow and acquire new special abilities and skills.\nCheck out this interview from OgreCave.com about PERK and where we're headed\nPERK was designed to be something that can introduce new players to the roleplaying world but also stick with them as they grow into a more experienced gamer, offering more depth and substance as they learn more about the hobby while always sticking to its simplistic core mechanics. I created PERK for my kids so that I could bring them into my favorite hobby and experience the bright eyed wonder that comes with learning to create stories for their first time. This is a passion that I hope they can pass on to their children and PERK is the perfect vessel for this. What sets PERK aside from most games aimed at kids is that there is an underlying depth of strategy and forethought in character creation as well as character development that allows experienced gamers to enjoy it as well. These themes are free to be ignored by new players to help them learn the game but they are always there to bring more to the table for gamers that crave a bit more 'game' with their storytelling.\nHere are some reviews of PERK so far:\nCheck out the reviews on Amazon\nRight now PERK is already a product you can buy and enjoy but at the moment only the Core Rulebook is available. This is basically all you need to play but we want to give players more options and give Narrators more ideas and tools for their games. This Kickstarter is for a Horror themed setting set in an alternate modern day Earth written by Buddy and Jake Wagner. Players can play as vampires, werewolves and other traditional horror characters from folklore (and some new original characters that have never been seen before!) as well as human characters that are trying to survive in a dangerous fantasy world. This book contains numerous tools to help narrators create thrilling horror stories in a variety of locations with any combination of character types. Each individual character type has been carefully weighed out so that they have a solid motivation and reason to exist in a story as well as a struggle they must fight to overcome throughout a story arc. We're also including comprehensive tools for building settings and detailing the process we took to create locations and character types so that Narrators can create their own with ease. Though PERK was created with kids in mind, this setting is dark and gritty and is targeted toward a mature audience. The book contains some harsh language as well as some violence and gore as you might expect from a horror game.\nHere is an example of Werewolf and Homunculus races from the book. You can expect to see this level of flavor in each character type description and is a good representation of the art style we are going for click to see the full pdf:\nWerewolf Sample\nHomunculus Sample\nCheck out these sample characters that we used for a live gaming event at CelestiCon this year\n Urban Gothic is a subgenre of horror fiction that originated in the mid 19th century and includes stories like Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, Bram Stoker's Dracula, Frankenstein and the like. In contemporary fiction this tradition has continued in the form of The Crow and From Hell and has influenced stories like Sin City and Anne Rice's vampire novels. It is characterized by dark cityscapes in which evil and misunderstood forces lurk beneath the guise of society and prey on the desperate and the unlucky. Urban Gothic stories often focus on societal relationships between the horrific and the mundane and usually include a romanticized take on the macabre life of night dwelling subhumans. This creates a perfect backdrop for players wanting to play these creatures in a bleak world where survival is the primary concern.\nCheck out the Urban Gothic wiki for more examples of novels, movies and comic books that can give you a good feel for what we're going for.\nPERK needs a lot of help. After publishing the Core Rulebook out of pocket, we have a solid understanding of what it takes to get everything done to a satisfactory level as well as getting prints and actually distributing the book so that our fellow gamers can enjoy the content. This is where the Kickstarter community can help us. Our goal with this product line is to create original, inspiring and profound worlds for our players to delve into and we have that part down. What we need help with is continuing our standard of artwork throughout the product line and getting an initial print run done. Artwork can be extremely expensive and you always get what you pay for. We have a few artists that we like to work with but they come at a cost. We want to keep retail costs as low as possible for our fellow gamers so we are reaching out to you to help get the artwork needed to help players become immersed in the worlds they are playing in and to help Narrators become inspired to write new and interesting stories.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nSome challenges we might face are getting all of the artwork done on time as well as printing proofs and everything.

That's also why it's called \"Hogger Logger\", because \"Higher Lower\" just wouldn't sound as good.\nAs the \u201cguesser\u201d, you must guess whether the next number card is higher or lower while using the cards in your hand to either help yourself or hurt your opponents. But watch out! Your opponents can also play cards and steal cards to change your odds.\nThe round starts with four face down cards. You win by being the player to correctly guess the last remaining card. Here's the tricky part: only one player can be the guesser and each time there is an incorrect guess the guesser rotates one spot to the left! \nIn Hogger Logger, you must know when to swine-and-dine your opponents and when to cut them down.

For further updates on digital Boss Monster, visit BrotherwiseGames.com or follow us on Facebook.\nBoss Monster is a dungeon-building card game that challenges players to become the ultimate villains: video game bosses. Thousands of players around the world have enjoyed the paper version of the game, but now Brotherwise Games is partnering with video game developer Plain Concepts, creators of Wave Engine, to bring Boss Monster from the tabletop to the digital world!\nA little under two years ago, we started Brotherwise Games with the launch of Boss Monster on Kickstarter. That successful campaign ignited a spark and Boss Monster has gone on to continued success in game and hobby stores across North America.\nOne thing we have heard over and over from fans of the game is, \"give us a video game version of Boss Monster!\" Maybe you'd like to play the game solo against a computer AI, or maybe you'd like to be able to find opponents at anytime online? Whatever your reason, if you're a Boss Monster fan, old or new, we hope you'll help make this version of the game a reality.\nWhat is Boss Monster?\nIf you've ever wanted to stomp on an upstart plumber or send your goblins and ghosts out to haunt some heroes, then Boss Monster is the game for you. Sporting beautiful retro-inspired pixel art, and paying homage to classic video games and geeky pop culture, Boss Monster immerses you in the role of the video game boss as you use Room Cards to build a dungeon which must entice worthy heroes, then slay them. \nIf you've never played Boss Monster, a good place to start is by watching this video from the magnificent team at Watch it Played!\nIf you're looking for a quicker overview of the game, check out Boss Monster in 60 Seconds.\nWhat Will the Digital Version Be Like?\nThis successful campaign allows us to build a digital version of Boss Monster for PC, Kindle, iPad & Android tablets. Digital Boss Monster will mimic all the gameplay available in the tabletop version while also taking advantage of the digital format to enhance your play experience.\nWhat are some of the features you'll see?\nPlay against up to three AI opponents in solo play.\nChallenge other human opponents via pass and play or online through Steam, Apple Game Center or Google Play.\nExplore new \"digitally-enhanced\" cards: four rooms, three new Bosses, and a new spell that all take advantage of the digital platform, allowing stats and treasure values to change as you play.\nTop-notch music and retro-inspired sound effects by Power Up Audio.\n  Play with ALL of the bosses, rooms, and spells available in the base game, and let the app do the math for you as you take advantage of rapid readout treasure counts in your and your opponents' dungeons.\nHere's a closer look at the current interface for the app. This is just a prototype, but already does a great job of showing how the final game will play.\nStretch Goals!\nOur campaign is now fully funded, and we've achieved all our stretch goals for this campaign!\nACHIEVEMENT UNLOCKED! All backers will receive a downloadable pack of DRM-free digital goodies including wallpapers, an MP3 soundtrack, a 50-page PDF Strategy Guide, and a Print-and-Play Card Creation Kit with PDF and Photoshop card templates!

CLICK HERE to join our newsletter for updates and reminders so you don't miss the next one!\nThe retail versions of Hostile Intent and Hidden Agenda will be available in stores by late November.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe Resistance gets even bigger with a special edition expansion that combines the two upcoming Resistance expansions (Hidden Agenda & Hostile Intent) and includes promo items that won't be included in the retail versions.  One box - eight new ways to play!\nNew \"You are Awesome\" rewards added - CLICK HERE or HERE for details.\nAvalon & 1st edition compatibility questions? - CLICK HERE for answers.\nIndie Boards and Cards is very excited to announce these exciting expansions for all the fans of our hugely successful game: The Resistance.  The expansions include several different module rules that can be mixed and matched, so the permutations of how you can play is practically limitless.. A copy of Resistance is required to play these expansion modules.\nNew to The Resistance?\nThe Resistance was Indie Boards and Cards' first break through success when released in 2010.   The game is now available in over 20 different languages and enjoyed around the world.  The best way to experience understand this simple, but immensely enjoyablegame of deception and deduction is to watch it in play.  Wil Wheaton's TableTop episode featuring The Resistance is an excellent way to experience this game for the first (or thousandth time):\nYou will be able to add The Resistance to your rewards after the project ends.  More details can be found in the \"add-on\" section below.\nHostile Intent\nBoth the retail and kickstarter editions of Hostile Intent will include the Hunter, Inquisitor and Reverser modules:\nHunter Module: The battle between resistance and imperial has become more intense.  It is no longer enough to target facilities in missions - the target has become personal as both sides look to neutralize their opponent's leaders.  In this module both the resistance and spies must identify a specific individual among the opposing team to win.  Hunters introduces many new game concepts that bring a whole new level of deduction and deceit into The Resistance.\nReverser Module: Reversers have the ability to change the results of any mission \u2013 in the hands of the resistance this can make a doomed mission succeed, or turn certain victory into defeat. A very interesting and potentially chaotic twist that is certain to change your meta game forever.\nInquisitor Module: The Inquisitor is an optional player ability first seen in Avalon. The player with the Inquisitor will be able to look at the affiliation of another player and is a simple way to ensure every game is full of interest twists and turns as the Inquisitor uncovers the truth (at least their version of the truth).\n\nHidden Agenda\nBoth the retail and kickstarter editions of Hidden Agenda will include the Assassin, Defector and Trapper modules:\nAssassin Module:  Every since we announced The Resistance: Avalon the request has been to take the exciting new roles from Avalon and make them available for The Resistance.  We are very excited to now make that available - the Assassin module of Hidden Agenda contains all the Avalon roles, rethemed and renamed to fit into The Resistance Universe.\nDefector Module: Two variants in one, the Defectors were included as part of the Avalon promos.  In one variant, the Defectors can switch allegiance during the game - ensuring that players are never quite certain who to trust.  In the second variant version the two Defectors know each other - ensuring that the accusations of deceit begin from the very opening of the game.\nTrapper Module: Every proposed Mission Team includes an extra person that won't go on the mission.  The leader will isolate a team member and watch their every move - making sure they can't make the mission fail. If you are a spy on the Mission Team, you\u2019ll never know if you will cause a mission to fail or simply be giving your identity away. But resistance members will have to approve some missions knowing that a spy is on them and trust that the leader chooses to isolate the spy.\nKickstarter Edition Promos:\nNot included in either the retail versions of Hostile Intent or Hidden Agenda are the Rogue Agent and Sergeant Modules.\nRogue Agent Module: Rogue Agents march to a different drum, whether Spy or Resistance they have their own victory conditions and would rather win by themselves than see their side victorious. Rogues are the first players in The Resistance that have a unique victory condition and are very interesting play option.\nSergeant Module:  First seen in the Avalon promo as Excalibur, the Sergeant is designated by the leader with ability to change mission results.  A very tricky proposition and sure to have everyone second guessing when to use, and when to just threaten with this ability.\nWhat more than one?\nEach pledge level has text that says \"Add $x for each additional copy\", increase your pledge amount by x to get a second copy of the Hidden Agenda & Hostile Intent Kickstarter Edition (yes, that does include the promo items). For example - if you are in the US and want 2 copies, select the $20 level and pledge $36.\nEssen Pick up\nOur plan is to have Hostile Intent & Hidden Agenda Kickstarter edition ready in time for Essen. It may be the case that we have games at Essen several weeks before the kickstarter backer copies are sent. It may also be the case that we are unable to get games to Essen in time. If you want Essen pick up - DO NOT PLEDGE FOR THIS PROJECT - all you have to do is sign up for our Essen email list by giving an email address: http://eepurl.com/RzQE9. Shortly before Essen we will ask you what you would like to pre-order for Thursday pick up at Essen. All the specials & promo items will be available - your support is very valuable to Indie Boards and Cards and we look forward to seeing you again this year with lots of great new games.\nAdd-ons\nAs a special reward for kickstarter backers and as a result of the advances we\u2019ve made in reducing shipping costs, we are able to offer great prices when adding some of our older titles when you pledge for Hostile Intent & Hidden Agenda Kickstarter Edition. After this project is closed, we will open Add-ons via paypal for backers. DO NOT ADD $ TO YOUR PLEDGE FOR ADD-ONS. Add-ons are for retail editions of the games listed below (no promos included) and will be sent with your rewards from this project (in November). All of these games are available right now at your local game store:\nThe Resistance\nThe Resistance: Avalon\nCoup\nCoup: Reformation (Coup Expansion) \nFlash Point Fire Rescue\nUrban Structures (Flash Point Expansion)\n2nd Story (Flash Point Expansion)\nExtreme Danger (Flash Point Expansion)\nDangerous Waters (Flash Point Expansion)\nVeteran & Rescue Dog (Flash Point Expansion)\nSnowdonia Jungfraubahn & Mt. Washington (Snowdonia Expansion)\nHaggis\nWhy Kickstarter?\nThree reasons really. First \u2013 I am very excited about this special edition of the expansion - I am only able to offer it (with all the extra costs that it has) if I get a minimum number of committed backers.  \nSecondly, it is all about cashflow. The time between when I pay for games (now) and when I get paid for them is upwards of 7 months, and that is in the best of circumstances. That takes a lot of money sitting in inventory, a bad thing for a small company.\nThirdly, I really wanted to be able to get a lot of little extras made for the biggest fans of the game. Kickstarter really is a great platform to do that through.\nWhat are Kickstarter Funds used for?\nYour pledge dollars go directly into making the pledge rewards, and shipping them to you. We have invested in getting the project to this point where its ready, your support ensures that we have the cash to pay our printers to make the games - the most costly part of game production.\nAbout Indie Boards and Cards\nIndie Boards and Cards started in 2009 as an independent publisher of great game designs. In 2010 we released three games, all of which have been well received by critics and fans alike. Our biggest seller has been The Resistance - a game of secret identities, deception and deduction that is now or will soon be available in 20 languages around the world. In 2011 we released Flash point: Fire Rescue, which has also been very well received and now available (or soon to be) in 10 different languages.  In 2012 we released the humorous game of certain death - Gauntlet of Fools and in 2013 we added Coup and Snowdonia to our portfolio.   Be sure to look for all these great games wherever you shop. If your favorite game store doesn\u2019t carry our games, please ask them to!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIndie Boards and Cards currently has two other projects that are due to be shipped in August 2014 (Coup Reformation & Dragon Slayer). Those games have already been produced and are on ship heading to distribution centers before being sent out to backers.\n\nIndie Boards and Cards has successfully delivered a number of previous kickstarter projects to thousands of supporters. We expect that our previous experiences will enable us to also deliver this project on time. That said there are always complexities and considerations in a project of this scope that may cause delays. Indie Boards and Cards will use contract manufacturing to make this game, freight forwarders to get games through customs and 3rd parties like Amazon, the US Post Office and FEDEX to ship the games to you - we don't control everything and there are lots of opportunity for delay. Other conditions may also cause delays - earthquakes, alien invasions, asteroid attacks, zombie plague are but a few of the myriad of reasons we may not be able to deliver this project in a timely manner.\n\nThis is a first edition of the expansions - by pledging to this project you are agreeing to be an early adopter and the extra items that are included in this edition (that aren't in the retail version) are your rewards and incentives for being an early adopter. But even with multiple edits, and constant proofing there may be minor typos, or grammar usage that is annoying to you in your rewards or other little things that would have been nice to have avoided but don't affect how the game is played. Mistakes that materially affects game play will of course be addressed but sometimes there are are minor errors that might be distracting but do not affect game play that I can't justify correcting. So if minor errors get under your skin and make it itch then you probably don't want to be an early adopter and are better off waiting till you've had a chance to see the final product and then buy it in your local hobby store. Kickstarter is not for everyone and I leave it to you to decide if you should be getting in on a first edition of this expansion.\n\nMy pledge is that I will deliver what I said and have written this project page as concisely and clearly as I can. So please read everything on this page - every kickstarter project is unique, and the commitments I am making to you regarding this project are completely defined here.\n\nA particular challenge to a project like this is negativity - I love your input, and really enjoy all the great suggestions that come from the large majority of our supporters. I can't include all the suggestions that I get, nor can I give you specific feedback other than noting that I do read all the comments and messages sent to me. So think before you post - threats, ultimatums and entitlement are unlikely to get you what you are asking for, and very likely that everyone else (myself included) will get less.\n\nRefunds - things happen and sometimes you need to get your money back. If you ask (before it's been submitted for shipment to you) , I'll refund your pledge less 20% to cover the costs that I can't recoup and costs of processing that refund. So think before you pledge - you can of course always remove your pledge before the funding deadline - but don't expect to get a 100% refund just because you forgot to remove your pledge before the project end ;)\n\nChanges - Images shown here are of the final art - however while it is not expected changes may be made before final production both to the art work and game contents. Variations in the production process and monitor calibration may cause alternations from the screen images to what appears in physical form.\n\nHave an issue? Send me a note - and please don't support us if you aren't satisfied with what the project is returning to you. Nothing would make me happier than having 100% of my supporters be 100% satisfied with their pledge rewards!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #26", "update_userinfo": "Resistance App Testing - Friday June 17th 4pm to 7pm at the Origins Game Fair", "update_content": "Testers wanted!\nWe are getting closer to the release of the Resistance App, and we'd like our backers to have the first look and help us test this ground breaking app. When we first discussed the app, I imagine that most everyone was thinking it would be a simple \"announcer\" - but I had always wanted more than that.\nThe Resistance app that we've been developing has an announcer - but it also allows you to play the entire game on your mobile devices.

A game by the Greek designers Konstantinos Kokkinis & Sotiris Tsantilas set in the Among the Stars Universe. The game features the art of Antonis Papantoniou.\nSTORY: Many years have passed since the formation of the Alliance. However, the glorious future that was promised has yet to arrive. In the aftermath of the Purge all the races vowed to cooperate towards a common goal. But as time went by, working together proved to be more difficult than expected. On top of that, the construction costs of new Stations kept rising. With the future of the Alliance hanging in the balance, it was decided that the countless destroyed worlds, remnants of the War and the Purge, should be revived. The facilities, laying there forgotten, could help in the improvement of the economy. Failure could mean the end of the Alliance and the disruption of peace. It is a desperate hope for a galaxy still haunted by its past, a final effort for a New Dawn.\nNew Dawn is the thematic sequel of Among the Stars. In New Dawn, players take the role of Alliance officials, belonging to different races, sent on a mission to explore and revive a part of the Galaxy. Each game lasts 5 rounds during which, players can explore regions, establish bases, seize control of facilities, send ambassadors, produce resources and send aid to the Alliance.\nGAMEPLAY: At the beginning of each round, in clockwise order, the players get resources from their established bases and draw new Facility cards. They use them to explore new regions by placing them on the board and performing the action written on them.\n      After all players have explored new Facilities, they have the chance to acquire new Technologies from their race deck - each one with its own advantages. In the move MHQ phase, players can move one of their Mobile Head Quarters to another region. MHQ allow each player to establish Bases on adjacent regions and increase his combat strength by allowing him to use additional dice with different values on them. The next phase of each Round is the Action phase. Each player performs 3 actions which are done one-at-a-time in clockwise order. In this phase players can establish new Bases on Facilities by paying credits, seize control of facilities through combat, use Ambassadors for various actions and buy new MHQ to improve their power and expandability. By placing a base on a Facility through the Establish Base or the Seize Control action, a player will score Victory points at the end of the game He can also acquire additional benefits based on the orientation he chooses. Each Facility has a number of arrows on it, indicating the number of benefits its controller can acquire. The game comes with 8 Base benefit cards, 4 of which are randomly chosen for each game.  At the end of each round, players have the chance to send aid to the Alliance, by dispatching large cargo ships filled with resources that will score them additional victory points at the end of the game.\n112 unique Facility cards, 8 Base Benefit cards, 8 Ambassadors, 8 Alien Races each with its own Technology deck and unique ability offer a huge amount of options, strategies and replayability.\nAs time passes by, allies become enemies once more and unless the Alliance maintains control, war seems inevitable. All everyone can hope for is a new beginning... a New Dawn.\n You can download the New Dawn rulebook by clicking here .\n Our main goal is to gather the funds needed to produce a first limited print run of the game. This will allow us to also have it available at Spiel 2014 in order to make it more popular and arrange deals with co-publishers in order to plan a much larger production, most likely within 2015. You can support us by ordering it or by spreading the word about this campaign on forums and social networks. \nNew Dawn features the artwork of Antonis Papantoniou. www.GameImager.com\n New Dawn is scheduled for production in August-September 2014 at Germany's largest game manufacturer, ensuring high quality materials.\nPlease note that the published product may have differences regarding sizes, quantities, colors or layout because of production limitations and/or adjustments. \nIMPORTANT: New Dawn is scheduled to be released at Spiel 2014 in Essen-Germany in October 2014. Even though we will do everything in our power to deliver the game to you before our current estimation (November 2014), the only guaranteed way that you will be among the first to get the game is to select an ESSEN-PICKUP pledge level. Since this is a Spiel 2014 release, several customers and retailers may purchase the game from the fair which means they will get it before our group shipment goes out to backers. Please back this project only after taking this information into account.\n Backers should be receiving their order within November 2014. We will do everything in our power to deliver your orders sooner than November 2014 (especially for items already in stock that are not part of group shipping). However, we state November 2014 as the delivery estimated period because there is always the chance of the production process getting delayed for various reasons.\nOur current shipping solution DOES NOT offer tracking.

Collecting and formatting (hopefully many) Vanity Card and Immortal pledge images will add some illustration and graphic design time, not a big hurdle.

Depending on how many stretch goals are unlocked, this will add time as new cards are decided by the Warchief backers and new art is produced. Fortunately, I have 7+ artists to assist me, so a highly successful funding campaign will simply engage more great illustrators.

This campaign is now closed. \"To order a March of the Ants or other Weird City Games merchandise, go to weirdcitygames.com/shop\n\"This is a game of its own 'type.' Fully satisfying thematic conflict driven Euro \u2013 I love it.\" -Undead Viking\n\"March of the Ants is a great game. It fires on all cylinders and should appeal to a wide audience.\" -Geek Insight from gfbrobot.com\n\"It\u2019s pretty much exactly what you\u2019d expect and want from a game called March of the Ants.\" -GeekDad.com Review.\nAs spring dawns the great thaw begins. Deep beneath the lush meadow grasses the queen stirs in her nest and the colony comes to life. Soldiers venture forth, battling centipedes while clashing with opposing colonies for territory. Workers dig an ever-expanding network of tunnels in their tireless search for food. The first larvae hatch and it is clear this generation will be different: the young colonies rapidly evolve into a multitude of new forms. The ants march out to claim the meadow as their own.\nIn March of the Ants, you create the shared meadow board by sending your ants to explore it, revealing and strategically placing twenty unique hexes like Fern, Pebble, and Nest of Centipedes. Each hex contains vital resources as well as an underground network of tunnels that connect you to your friends\u2026and your enemies.\nPopulate new territory by breeding larvae and marching your ants onto collection sites. Will you engage competing colonies in battle, seeking to claim the land for yourself? Or will you establish peaceful, symbiotic relationships and share the spoils? Fortunately for you, there are cards that support and reward a wide variety of strategies. Collecting and managing the colony's resources in your nest is the first step in your bid for meadow dominance.\nMid-way through a four player game (prototype components).\nForage for Event Cards like Strange Appetite, Cold Snap, and Fungal Outbreak to impact the entire board \u2013 or just one unlucky opponent. What might you find as you dig through the deck of fifty-four unique cards?\n Mutate your colony with special evolution cards like the Trap Jaw head, Weaver thorax, and Leaf Cutter abdomen. What weird and wondrous path will your colony\u2019s evolution take: advanced Workers, fearsome Soldiers, or a fertile Queen? Each evolution helps forge your colony's destiny, enhancing your ants' capabilities while shaping your strategy.\nEmerge triumphant by scoring Colony Points as your ants explore and control the Meadow. Search for Colony Goals like Epic Stores, Followers of the Eyeless, and Extensive Tunnels to plan your route to victory.\nFeaturing beautiful original art and illustrations, March of the Ants is a fun, dynamic, and interactive board game that takes strategy underground\u2026literally! \n1 Great Tunnel center tile\n20 Meadow Hex tiles\n4 player nest mats\n144 larvae/ant tokens (wooden cubes)\n54 Ant Cards\n12 page full color rulebook\n4 player aids\n1 wooden 1st player marker\n1 round marker token\n1 Colony Score Track\n30 food tokens (wooden discs)\n8 centipede/wormhole tokens\nNote: The Custom Wood Round Marker, Centimeeples and Blank Card Stretch Goals will not be included in the base game of March of the Ants sold at retail. This makes them a great, non-exclusive perk for backing the game on Kickstarter. We are working to keep the retail price of the game as affordable as possible, which is why these wooden components will not be included in the retail version of the game.\n\"March of the Ants is a wonderful resource management game with a layer of direct competition and area control...it has great thematic elements, aggressive play, direct conflict, and other aspects that really make the game come alive and feel highly interactive.\"- Geek Insight Review on Giant Fire Breathing Robot\n\nUndead Viking Video Review:\n\"I really like the way that when you select an action in the Worker phase, the other players get a secondary action. It keeps everyone in the game even when it\u2019s not their turn. Another thing I like is that there are multiple paths to victory. Just because you manage to put a lot of ants out on the board doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re going to win.\" Geekdad.com review by Jonathan H. Liu\n\"March of the Ants is a great mix of resource management, exploration, area control, and card play. It really hits a sweet spot with lots of interesting decisions packed into a short period of time, and it really manages to be complex without being complicated. Overall, March of the Ants is a rich and rewarding experience. After back-to-back plays I still want more!\" - James Brady, Owner of Cloud Cap Games\n\"I was lucky enough to play this game at Gamestorm this year in Vancouver, WA. While March of the Ants is still in its final developmental stage, it already offers unusually tight gameplay and dynamic variability in the choices available to the players. Interesting tile placement exploration blends well with a multi-use card system that allows you to evolve, trigger events or receive battle bonuses. It is all enhanced by great art throughout. This is the increasingly rare game that's actually worthy of your Kickstarter dollars, and then some!\" - Rob Faulconer, BGG\nInspired by diverse mechanics from Race for the Galaxy, Twilight Imperium and Eclipse, March of the Ants offers dynamic player interaction and abundant thematic flavor, challenging each player to create a thriving ant colony through a variety of strategies from aggressive expansion to dedicated evolution to peaceful coexistence and symbiosis.\nEach round is divided into three phases: Worker, Soldier, Queen. \nDuring the Worker Phase your ants will perform the various actions of Explore, Forage, and March as well as playing Event, Evolution, and Colony Goal cards. \nAll actions have a secondary action that the other players get to perform, so every player is continuously active and engaged during the game! \nIn the Soldier Phase ant battle is resolved in all Meadow Hexes that are contested. Combat is light and fast, featuring a simultaneous reveal mechanic that adds dramatic tension to each ant battle. \nAnt battle is an important part of March of the Ants but is not the focus of the game; aggression can complement some strategies nicely but might also leave you spread thin and defenseless! \nDuring the Queen Phase all resources are collected and you must feed all of your ants in the Meadow. The queen also gives you a choice of producing food or larvae through her Royal Decree, balancing your economy as you plan your next turn. \nEvolutions: For your ants to rise above all the others you must evolve. By adding new evolutions to your head, thorax or abdomen thousands of unique ant species can be discovered, helping to shape your strategy and path to victory. \nSet-up takes less than 5 minutes! With one deck of cards, multi-purpose egg/larvae/ant tokens and interlocking modular hex tiles, our game's elegant design fosters immersive, strategic gameplay without feeling overwhelming or stressful. All with a total play time of about an hour and fifteen minutes.\nMarch of the Ants Playthrough Video Round One:\n For a continuation of this game see the videos at the bottom of the project page.\nDraft Rules (plain text)\nDraft Rules (text and diagrams)\nPledge at the Marching Ant level or higher and you will receive the game before it is available at retail and at $10 below expected MSRP.\nWe offer a 100% satisfaction guarantee. If you are not completely satisfied with the game return it to us with 30 days of receiving it and we will give you a complete refund.\nYour Support is Essential: We have done all of the work designing and creating original art for this game and need your help to make it a reality.\nAwesome Stretch Goals: By pledging now for $35 or more you are eligible for any and all Kickstarter stretch goals.\nMarch of the Ants features elegant design that has gone through dozens of drafts and revisions through discussion and play testing. We have created a massive cache of amazing original art to match the theme and feel of the game. The high-quality components are intuitive and functional. March of the Ants is already a great game; we are confident it can become even better if we all spread the word, rally the board gaming community, and exceed our basic funding goal.\nUnlocked Stretch Goal #1 $22,500: This amount of funding will add a mini-expansion of another social insect to the world of the ants. This will provide 6 additional cards featuring head, thorax and abdomen evolutions of the new social insect, two Event cards that enhance that insect\u2019s theme, and a Colony Goal that matches that insect's approach to victory.\nBest of all, you, the backers, will select which social insect will be the first mini-expansion for March of the Ants. Will it be Bees, Spiders or Beetles?\nUnlocked Stretch Goal #2 $25,000: Upgraded Card Quality - When this stretch goal is reached we will upgrade all of the Ant cards to 320gsm black core. This is casino quality, with great elasticity and durability. All ant cards will also be linen embossed with excellent texture and smooth feel. We are very excited to be able to raise the quality of the cards as the Ant deck is one of the central parts of March of the Ants.\nUnlocked Stretch Goal #3 $30,000:Starting Species Advanced Variant Each player nest will now be double sided, featuring an optional unique species that starts with its own evolution and personality. Start the game with variable player powers based on primitive evolutions!\nUnlocked Stretch Goal #4 $33,000 - Custom Wood Round Marker. This stretch goal will upgrade the chipboard round marker to a custom wood shape decided by the backers. Note: This stretch goal will not be included in the base retail version of March of the Ants.\n Social Stretch Goal #1 500 likes on Weird City Games Facebook Page: When this goal is reached we will add four full color pages to our rulebook. This will allow us to include information on the ant species that inspired the evolutions as well as information on specific card interactions.\nUnlocked Stretch Goal #5 36,000 - New Evolutions. Backers choose and nominate species to be used as inspiration for three new cards, a head, a thorax and an abdomen.\nUnlocked Stretch Goal #6 $40,000 - Centimeeples!This stretch goal will unlock four custom wood cut Centimeeple shapes will be included in the game, dramatically bringing the ants greatest threat to life. Centipedes are the main pest that ants must deal with in the Meadow and we are excited to include this upgrade in the game. Note: This stretch goal will not be included in the base retail version of March of the Ants.\n\nUnlocked Stretch Goal #7 $45,000 - At this level we will increase the box thickness from 1.5 mm to a very sturdy 2 mm chipboard. This will insure that the box is a joy to pick up and handle and lasts for the lifetime of the game.\n\nUnlocked $45,000 Bonus Goal - Each Kickstarted copy of March of the Ants will come with six make-your-own customizable cards! These will feature the backs of the cards and the front layout of the three card types, allowing you to add three unique evolutions to the game, two original events and one Colony Goal of your own design. Note: This stretch goal will not be included in the base retail version of March of the Ants.\nUnlocked Stretch Goal #8 $50,000 - will release the oft requested rules for cooperative and solo play. These play variants will include a special centipede mat that is used to direct the centipede units, while neatly repurposing any cards that depend on player interaction. The ants will defend the Great Tunnel against a horde of invading centipedes, which will look great with those awesome centipede meeples we just unlocked!\nUnlocked Stretch Goal #9 $55,000 - Custom Starting Player Marker. This will be a wooden disc with a custom screen printed design.We have a couple ideas for the design but if you think you have a great idea please mention it in the comments. Note: This stretch goal will not be included in the base retail version of March of the Ants.\nStretch Goal #10 $60,000 - 5 Player Expansion. When we reach this level we will add components to enable a fifth player to march into the meadow.

Just a whole lot darker.\" Says Cardboard Republic who included us in the PAX East recap, where we made the list of his 10 favorite things there, and the resulting preview.\nDJ Grandpa interviewed us for his crowdfunding podcast, DJ Grandpa's Crib.  Our interview starts around the 9 minute mark.\nYou are among a group of survivors, those that were smart enough to hide underground when war came to your city. While there are many people here, only a few of you have volunteered to venture out past the relative safety of your makeshift base in the tunnels. No one knows what is out there, but supplies are running out, and you need to find more if everyone is going to continue surviving. Staying alive isn\u2019t enough though, you need to start rebuilding, or at least making things a little more secure. Your team must explore the nearby tunnels in order to keep your base camp supplied with the food and resources necessary to rebuild.\nUnknown is a fully cooperative tile based exploration and survival game for 1-6 players.  Players create the game board by exploring tiles around their base, and attempt to keep the base camp stocked with food while gathering resources and performing actions to complete the mission\u2019s objectives. The players win when they complete the mission objective and accompanying minor objective. The players lose if the base runs out of food.\nA game in progress (prototype shown)\nA few of the characters and missions (prototypes shown)\nprototype contents\n14 Characters up from 8 thanks to 6 generous backers, plus one additional only for this printing \n8 Mission objectives, plus an additional 2 (and counting) only in this printing\n5 Minor objectives\n6 enemy types, including 5 custom meeple designs\nOver 100 tiles, including 8 different types of environmental hazards\nOver 100 meeples, cubes, discs and other wooden pieces\n  Prototype Custom meeple outlines for the enemies in the base game\n What you see in the photos and videos are our current prototypes, so even though they are nice as far as prototypes go, you can certainly expect some upgrades in the production version.  Tiles will be 2mm chipboard (think Carcassonne but slightly larger) and the tile backs will be printed with a non-distracting pattern that will better fit the theme.  The art itself is complete, but the graphic design of the cards, tiles, and quick reference sheet is still being ironed out to improve clarity and feel.  We haven't shown it yet, but the box insert is also something we are focusing on, making sure that all of the parts have a home and including room for all of the expansion parts as well.\nCustom wooden prototype box and early rendering of the production box insert, both with room for all of the base game and the expansion.\nFully cooperative.  There is no traitor and there are no points to muddy the goals. You either win as a team, or everyone starves together.  The game may be played solo or with up to 6 players, and because it is cooperative it can easily accommodate players leaving early or joining late.\nHighly Varied Gameplay.  One of our main goals is to ensure that no two games play alike, so we included four separate changing facets that interact in different ways every time. First, different characters' abilities change how you play since they gain bonuses to their particular role. Second, the mission objective sets the overall goal for the game, from simply scouting the area to more complex missions like rescuing refugees or defeating bosses. Third, the minor objective not only gives a second task to complete but also an additional bonus or ability once finished that will alter how the rest of the game is played. Finally, exploring tiles means that the board lays out differently each game, but the tiles in the deck also change each time so you never know what is coming.  While all of these parts are different, we worked hard to ensure that they are all balanced so that while the gameplay changes, the overall difficulty doesn't unless you want it to.\nVariable Difficulty .  Since the tile deck is built before each game by adding randomized creatures and hazards, it is easy to tune to the desired difficulty. If you want a more casual game, leave out an enemy or environmental hazard. If you want to fight more at the same overall difficulty, trade a few environmental hazards for an extra enemy.\nEasy to Teach and Quick to Start . The basic concepts and actions are easy to learn and teach; a new player can be taught enough to join the game in under five minutes. In most cases all of the information you need about a tile is right on it, and if it\u2019s not there it is on the player mats pictured below. All of the tiles are also color coded to make setup and break down quick and easy.\nThe front of the quick reference mat (prototype shown)\n Want an extra copy or some other thing we offer?  Here are the things you can add to any pledge of $55 or higher:\n1 extra copy of the game: $40  \n1 signed art book: $70 \nSmall digital art pack: $15 \nFull digital art pack: $30 \nTo add any of these, just adjust your pledge for the amount indicated, plus the shipping cost in the \"each other item\" column of the shipping chart.\nA major part of any game is the art and our artist, Boya Sun has done a fantastic job of bringing you into the world in the small space provided by tiles and cards.\n Characters\nEnemies\nHazards\n Objectives and Base Tile\nAll of the content for the base game is ready to go, and the art is already complete.  All we need now is help to fund the initial print run of the game.  Using conservative estimates, we expect final layout to take two to three months.  After that it is 30 days of proofing with the printer, 60 days for mass production, and 30 days for shipping and customs.  This puts the expected date for fulfillment of the base game at February of 2015.  The content for the expansion is complete, as is most of the art, but it still needs a bit of balancing which we plan to complete while the base game is in production.  If the funding for the expansion is met, this puts the delivery date for that at roughly April of 2015.\n Rob and Dave Games was formed in 2013 after two years of potluck dinner and game nights.  Every Friday we would gather for dinner, put the kids to bed, and then stay up way too late playing games. After 100 or so such gatherings we came to two conclusions. First, after playing a literal wall full of different games, a large part of our fun had become figuring out how to improve the games by tweaking mechanics. Second, playing cooperative games made it much more likely that everyone involved would have a good time. Putting these two realizations together, we decided to start building a team based game from the ground up.\nRob is a long time video and board gamer and a new Daddy. He spends his days working as a computer consultant and every spare moment with his 8 month old son-while working on Unknown. When not working on the game Rob loves spending his time with his wife Lisa hiking, biking, and basically anything active. The love of games began for Rob in high school with Magic the Gathering. That transferred to board games when he started visiting the local game store to improve his decks. What started with Settlers of Catan evolved to Dominion and has now exploded to an almost unhealthy game collection. A growing family and a friendly gaming group has led to the desire for more cooperative board games; hence Rob and Dave Games. Rob and his family spend Friday night at Dave\u2019s playing a variety of board games, and attending or hosting a Saturday game day at least once a month. Unknown is the first game he and Dave have been able to see come to life on Kickstarter, but we promise that more are brewing.\nDave is an ever busy father of two. With an active 4 year old boy and 1 year old girl Dave and his wife Terry are insuring the next gaming generation. Dave is the analytical compliment of Rob.  He enjoys the gamification of most things, and this along with a background in computers and restaurant management leads him to constantly analyze numbers and rework mechanics. Dave started gaming on computers with Tactical Armor Command on the Apple II, and has since progressed through many genres and forms of gaming.  Dave and Terry helped start this whole crazy gaming journey by inviting Rob and Lisa to their first PAX, PAX Prime, 6 years ago. Soon after that began Dave and Terry\u2019s weekly game nights, and from that was the drive to develop a cooperative board game that everyone would want to play.\nIn order to reduce shipping costs for international backers, we will be shipping rewards from multiple warehouses, hopefully one close to where you are.  To calculate the shipping cost to add to your pledge just find your destination and count the items (games and art books) in your pledge level. For example, if you are in Canada and pledge at the $125 level (game + art book) you would add $15 for the game (first item) and $5 for the book for a total pledge of $145.  If you pledged at the $55 level from Italy, you would add $25 for the game for a total pledge of $80.\n Here are some of the missions and characters we have featured in past updates.  Be sure to check back often as we add more!\nPrototype shown\nThe survivors have heard reports of an immense creature wandering the tunnels.  Previous attempts to defeat it have been unsuccessful, and so the new plan is to gather some of the more volatile chemicals stored about the tunnels.  Once enough have been gathered, a concentrated attack will hopefully overpower the Behemoth.\nThe mission will include 5 tiles, the first 4 tiles may be gathered to gain a toxic barrel token.  The 5th will spawn the Behemoth, and players must attack him with all 4 barrels before he reaches the base and decimates the population.  The Behemoth (modified to be tough but killable) may also be added to other missions as one of the random enemy tiles.\nPrototype shown\n The investigator excels at situational awareness, allowing her to assess the nearby area while gathering supplies.  After gathering, she may immediately explore an adjacent tile without spending an action.  The Investigator is usually best when at the fringes, and must plan well to best use her ability.  \nThe Captain is a master of teamwork.  His training helps him to motivate others, and pushes him to lead by example.  He gets a bonus action when starting near other survivors, and may also direct one of them to move for free each turn.  The Captain is best suited to traveling with others, and efficient coordination is necessary to make sure you make the most of his bonuses.\nPrototype shown\n The base is mostly secure, but what lies in the rest of the tunnels is (Unknown?) a mystery.  The survivors have been tasked with exploring far enough out that we can get a better idea of where we are and what is nearby.  Once we have an area mapped out, we can more easily patrol the perimeter and hopefully secure the interior.\nIn the Map mission players must explore tiles until there is a completed perimeter that is large enough to enclose a 9x9 square.  There are over 60 tiles in the deck and it only takes 34 of them to form a square that size, so what makes this a challenge?  The perimeter itself does not have to be a square, but every turn you are forced to take adds tiles to your path.  Enemies and environmental hazards will make you choose between efficient pathing and resource use.  Add in the fact that you still need to keep base supplied with food while you are exploring as quickly as possible away from base and this becomes even harder.\nPrototype shown\nTo improve the conditions at base camp, the survivors have been tasked with reactivating the local power grid.  There is still power running, but the system has been shut down.  Reactivating it requires synchronized commands from three of the control consoles scattered about the tunnels.\nThe mission adds three console tiles to the deck and the players must explore them all on the same turn.  This means that your odds increase as the remaining deck gets smaller, but also means that you lose time throughout the game when exploring one or two consoles at a time.  This mission encourages efficiency of actions and setting up the next turn for maximum exploration opportunities.\nPrototype shown\n Most of you made it to the camp, but there are still some people missing, and they need to be found. Some of the stragglers have family or friends here that want them found, and once the way is clear they will make their own way to base. There are more Refugees, but our camp can only support so many. We will find them and keep them safe for a time, but we will need to find another place for them to live in the long term.  \nBoth of these missions will utilize the Refugee tiles but require different strategies to complete. The Refugee mission is very time intensive, since the Refugees lower your AP when carried and must be carried around a good bit. This makes the players focus on keeping base stocked and planning their paths efficiently. The Stragglers mission is more about area control, making sure the Stragglers have a safe path back to base. This gives you the choice of guarding and escorting, or clearing the enemies and waiting, both of which have pros and cons.\nPrototype shown\nThe survivors don't really like the idea of eating the things that grow down here in the tunnels, but when you're hungry enough food is food. We've been collecting the food that hasn't spoiled, but the rest of it has been feeding an array of plants and mushrooms. If we collect enough of them, we should be able to test out which are edible and which aren't so the civilians can sort them out when we bring them back.   \nMinor Objectives provide a second task that must be completed for victory, but also give a perk once done to help you out for the rest of the game. This gives you something to split your attention and resources early game, and then a bonus later to help finish the mission. This minor objective requires players to return 5 plant tokens to base, and then test them with 2 medicine. After that, all plant tokens returned to base will turn into food. Since we don't know which are good and so gather a whole pile of them, survivors can only carry one plant token at a time. The earlier it is completed the better, and once completed can be a good deal of bonus food, but it requires that survivors rotate base-return duties instead of loading one person up. This creates interesting choices on how and when to spend the extra time and resource to complete it, and then alters the normal routine of food shipments to base.\nPrototype shown\nSome of the survivors want to extend the fortifications around our base camp. We should be able to salvage some usable fencing from any bunkers or workshops we find and put it to good use. It may be extra work, but it should keep everyone a bit safer, and save us a bit of walking in the long run. We should also work on improving our communication options. The abandoned bunkers usually have walkie talkies laying around, we just need some spare parts to fix them up. Hopefully with a clearer signal we will be able to talk each other through tasks that aren't usually our forte.  \nExtend Perimeter tasks players with gathering and using fences to increase their area of control. Once complete the fences allow trade with base and slow down approaching enemies. Layout of the fence can be used to overcome the constrictions of early-game hazards, or to fortify vulnerable points of entry. Walkie Talkies allows players to spend an action to take on the ability of a different character once completed. This allows you to choose the right ability for your situation, and can lead to impressive combos if used well.\n Want to show everyone that you backed us?

But this will be a learning process for us, and it\u2019s quite possible that we will hit unforeseen bumps along the way.\n\nFor production, we have a reputable company lined up and have quotes from them to ensure that our budget is reasonable.

An additional 10-minute track will be added for everyone.\n #2 - Unlocked! We'll be able to add iOS and Android phone/tablet support to the DM web app.\n #3 - Unlocked! Yet another 10-minute track will be added for everyone.\nUpdates\nWeb-based app planned for release, made for DMs. Details here and here.\nFree bonus tracks for backers. Preview 1  |  Preview 2\nJust a technical detail ... I'm going to be shipping the surround files to you in DTS format rather than Dolby Digital (AC3). It's better because it's a lossless format, and it's easy to burn onto CD, DVD, or BluRay if you want to roll with a disc in your media center. (Haha, \"roll\", pun intended.)\nNew $5 reward tier added for supporters. Get the two bonus tracks and a \"thank you\" on the project website.\nOptional 5-Track Add-on\nIn addition to the free bonus tracks announced in the Update section, you can increase your pledge by $5 to get 5 additional tracks, as an add-on. An option for those who might want a few more environments for their gaming sessions.\nBackers who have already pledged $40 or more will receive these add-on tracks automatically, with no additional pledge needed.\nAbout the Project\nThis project's goal is to tap into the concept of enhancing your tabletop games through sound, and take it to the next level. Combining lush soundscapes with ambient music, The Wilderness is a collection of aural environments that will help transport you into the worlds that you create for your games. Because tabletop gaming is a social experience, it's important that any accompanying audio and music be subtle and supportive ... never taking center stage and never distracting from your adventures, yet bolstering emotion at the same time.\nAudio Examples\nHere's a sample of what you can expect from The Wilderness. This track is set in the deep forest - somewhere wild, magical and untouched by civilization.\nDeep Forest\n(You can download this track from the official project website.)\nHere's some more samples from Bonus Tracks that have been added to the project for all backers.\nSnowy Mountain\nRolling Seashore\nWhat You'll Get\nIf the minimum project funding level is reached, all contributors will receive the entire collection of ten tracks (100 minutes of audio) plus the two bonus tracks above, in digital format via direct download. For every additional $750 reached above the funding goal, an extra 10-minute track will be added to the collection. The Wilderness has the potential to grow very large - and the bigger it gets, the more value each contributor will receive for their contribution. \nUPDATE: Each track will be delivered in two versions - with music, and without music. This will allow for maximum flexibility during a gaming session.\nProduction\nThe entire production will be created in full 5.1 surround, designed especially for those living room gaming sessions that include a multichannel sound system. Each piece of audio will be carefully downmixed to stereo as well, in case you're accompanying your gathering with something smaller, like a laptop or smartphone. (Or if you'd simply like to listen to them casually on your own!) Each of the 10 included tracks will be ten minutes long, constantly shifting and changing to keep things fresh and inspiring.\nThe Wilderness is the first volume of what will ideally become a massive library of ambient audio for tabletop gaming. This volume's focus will be on fantasy outdoor environments, like enchanted forests (including the evil ones) snowy mountains, teeming grasslands, scorched deserts, peaceful lakes, frothy oceans ... and otherworldly locales that you could imagine traveling to in your adventures.\nCollaboration is an important part of The Wilderness. Higher level contributors will decide which environments are ultimately included in the collection through per-track, poll-based voting.\nRewards\nYou'll notice that this project only has 4 reward tiers. You'll also notice that there is no physical product like a CD or a DVD. After a lot of careful consideration, the project was structured this way for a few reasons:\nMore often than not, high-tier rewards go unclaimed in many Kickstarter projects. By remaining conservative and only having 3 meaningful (and affordable) ways to contribute, everyone benefits from the project structure, because ...\nEach additional $750 that is funded in the project will enable an additional 10-minute track, for all backers. This does something important - it encourages people to spread the word about The Wilderness, and provides more and more value for your individual contribution as total funding increases.\nPhysical media like a disc doesn't seem suitable for a collection of audio tracks of this length, especially if we manage to produce more than the 10 initial tracks. It's important to get the content to you quickly and easily and to use funds directly for soundscape creation, not physical goods.\nImagine your tabletop games with a layer of extra immersion on top.

New rewards! Announcing our website: IndieVanGameJam.com!\nThe series is about asking a question. Every episode is a question about game design that we think the studio we\u2019re visiting is trying to answer. As we travel to their studio in the Indie Van, we explore the answer to that question ourselves in the form of a game jam.\nA Sample Episode\nFor example, say we travel to BioWare (not an Indie, but a great example!), they usually make games that involve branched storytelling and choices. The question for them might be \u2018is truly consequential branched storytelling actually possible in video games?\u2019 This is a question many folks have asked about game design over the years. Once we have The Question that is right for the studio, we hop in the Indie Van and game jam along the way, trying our hardest to answer the question ourselves. When we arrive at the studio, we interview the developers and ask them The Question \u2013 then we show them the current state of our game jam and see what insights they have. Now, armed with the sage wisdom of the masters, we finish the game jam in the van on the way home and release it with the episode as a digital download. (More on that later.) \nCheck out a video teaser for what kind of talk we talk with someone like Stoic!\nA Series?\nYes, indeed! We want to film an 8 episode series. That means we want to create 8 web episodes, featuring 8 indie developers, spanning 8 different cities, and delivering 8 small game jam games which could range from totally awesome to total trainwreck! These games will be made available for download at the same time the episode airs, so you can join us on the adventure.\nThe series is about the DIY spirit \u2013 start working now! Do it yourself! Just go find the people who are experts and ask them how they got there! You don\u2019t need to wait to be discovered, go out and get it! The series is about travel! We wander through the world seeking out our heroes and trying to meet them at eye level! We explore the world and turn up pockets of awesomeness all over the place! We get travel-weary and car-crazy and grumpy and eat weird local food! We try to become a part of these places we\u2019re visiting, like travelers, not tourists! The series is about Zeb and Chad and our dumb sense of humor! Our own weird perspectives on games and what we think is awesome about them! Our dumb jokes! About how our personalities are both similar and different and the celebration of that!\nGames!\nGames as well! Every episode features us doing a Game Jam that seeks to explore The Question that we are posing to the Indie Sages. As we make our way around North America, we will meet both success and failure in making bite-sized games in numerous styles in a bite-sized amount of time. Whether we win or lose, you can check out the awesome or awesomely bad results for yourself. Right beside each episode will be a way to buy the game from the episode. Since these games can be a gamble, we won't charge more than 99 cents for the awesome ones and the awesomely bad will be free.\nBinary Solo is a two-man indie studio formed by Chad Stewart and Zeb West in Austin, TX. Our mission is simple: Make the games that we would want to play, and play the games that we would want to make. \nChad and Zeb met while working on Star Wars: The Old Republic at BioWare Austin and bonded over a shared desire to charge into the vibrant indie scene which has erupted in North America. With new tools, markets and funding channels available to the masses, and a rebellious dissatisfaction with the increasingly bland games being turned out by large publishers, now is the time to make the game you dreamed about. Chad is programming and president, Zeb is production and design. Together they are on a crusade to stamp out the jive and bring in the love. \nThe Indie game scene is so vibrant right now, with the tools for development and distribution being democratized \u2013 readily available and in the hands of the people! That\u2019s causing some outrageous games to come out as a result of a revolution \u2013 shaking up the games that large publishers have been delivering to gamers, and giving rise to vibrant, experimental new flavors and genres, answering an outcry for something new. We thought it would be fun to get right inside this bustling scene, and show what the indie developers are doing \u2013 how they\u2019re going about things differently, how that \u2018do it yourself\u2019 indie spirit is spawning innovation and creativity. Seeing how a small pack of passionate developers can turn out something better and more interesting than armies of corporate developers who might be so compartmentalized and disenfranchised that they've lost the fire for the games they\u2019re making!\nVideo games are such a young industry it\u2019s easy to forget that the development structure and a publishing model is still being defined! What happens when you put the tools of production in the hands of smart, savvy, hungry creatives who care more about making the games they want, than making the games they think would sell like a blockbuster?  \nThis series will be vital to the next generation of gamers. They will get a window into the pioneers on the indie front. They\u2019ll be inspired by that \u2018do it yourself\u2019 spirit and hopefully make the connection that everything they need is in front of them. That young developer or armchair designer will get an over-the-shoulder view of the back-yard wrestling of game development: The developers who took that scary leap outside the studio/publisher system in order to follow their passion.\nThis tour goes across the country (and maybe across the maple curtain into Canadian!) Starting in Austin, TX; we will be traveling around North America seeking out independent developers big and small. Who will this include?\nStoic Studios \u2013 Austin, TX\nJohn Watson, Arnie Jorgenson, and Alex Thomas are the makers of the kickstarter-backed, gorgeous, and epic turn-based strategy game The Banner Saga. In the Spring of 2013, they released Banner Saga: Factions, and are currently working day and night to finish the single player version.\nIndie Game Collective \u2013 Boston, MA\nThe Indie Game Collective is a unique group of studios and individual developers located in a single co-working space in Boston. They collaborate and help each other, a group of indies toiling together. The Collective includes: Ichiro Lambe and Rohit Shenoy (Dejobaan Games),  David W. Evans (Hybrid Mind Studios), Erik Asmussen (82 Apps) , Michael Carriere (ZapDot), Trevor Stricker (Disco Pixel), and more.\nROB LACH \u2013 Chicago, IL \nRob Lach is the creator of POP: METHODOLOGY EXPERIMENT ONE, a game that has received praise from Indiecade, Fantastic Arcade, and others. As a single developer going it on his own, he embodies the Indie spirit.\nOreganik - Eugene, OR\nOreganik is a delightful play on words. They are currently making a game called Chess Heroes which you can now vote for on Steam Greenlight!\nKLEI Entertainment - Vancouver, British Columbia (That's Canada!)\nKLEI Entertainment are the folks behind the masterpieces Don't Starve and Mark of the Ninja (among others.) They are currently working on their new tactical stealth game Incognita.\n As you can see, most of the costs of this project are actually related to having someone do the filming. This includes equipment that we will have to buy and rent. Otherwise, save for the fees, our biggest collection of costs is the travel costs. Driving around the country requires money, an amount which we have calculated using mileage numbers, gas prices, and Good Math.\nRegardless of your Backer level, you will be able to watch the show. Different levels will offer an advanced screening, but no tier will leave you without access to the show itself! Where levels above $25.00 stand out, however, is that they include all of the games (8!) that we will create.\nIndie Van Game Fan!\nReceive a post card from the road! It wouldn't be authentic if it wasn't bought and mailed from somewhere on our trip! You'll receive a post card from a stop on the trip with a personal note from us. Will it be Chicago? Boston? Who knows!\nIndie Van Game Clan!\nJoin the club! As part of the Indie Van Game Clan you now get access to advanced screenings of the episodes before they go live, including all of the game and social features that entails! You get to download the game (don't mind the Buy button, you'll have a special view!) While you will get to see our verdict during the episode, we also want your opinion! Tell us whether the game was Fun or Failure. Just like in this fancy, not final mockup!\nIndie Van Grand Stand!\nYou're in the good seats! In addition to the Game Clan! rewards you get a downloadable version of the series after it has finished airing. This will also include new special features and bonuses. \nIndie Van Tribute Band!\nOne of the rewards we have our heart set on is a DVD set. There is just something intangible about a physical product for some people. (We are some of those people!) For those of you who are tooting our horn, this is what a DVD set may look like:", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere\u2019s a ton of coordination and tour management to do to get all these trips and interviews planned \u2013 will logistics agree with reality in order to get the episodes filmed, edited and published? Flat tires? Blown head-gaskets? Game-jam arguments so headed we have to pull the car over and cry and hug it out? We have tried to plan for every eventuality, but sometimes fate puts a nail in your tire.\n\nVideo Games can be a boom and bust industry \u2013 maybe some of these studios might not last long enough for us to come interview them. Maybe some studios might be weird or paranoid about how they will be presented, so they may give us a hard time or resist sharing with us. \n\nSome of the game jams might be disasters \u2013 that\u2019s a lot of pressure stacked on top of all the logistics of just doing the interviews. Chad and Zeb might get into fights (although we think that might make for great entertainment!) Would it be as exciting knowing we will always succeed? We don't think so! Just like in Man Vs.

Explore untamed wilds, delve the deepest dungeons, crush terrible and remorseless monsters, and roll around in piles of shiny loot. Currently in development for Windows, the Dungeonmans Summer Preview is available right now for you to play!\nSurrounded by monsters deep underground? Perfect!\nThe game takes a heroic approach to the best features of the traditional roguelike. Dungeons are generated at random, with new twists and encounters down every set of stairs. Combat is turn-based and tactical, with many options for players to use to get themselves out of (or into!) trouble. Character development in Dungeonmans is free-form and player driven. Picking from a large collection of Masteries, you create the hero you want, and send them to go die in a dungeon.\nTravel through underground caves to take shortcuts across the overworld!\nThe combat in Dungeonmans demands smart thinking and clever positioning. As a Dungeonmans (or Lady Dungeonmans) you'll have access to combat abilities that make fighting more than simply trading attacks. Tricks and flashy effects aren't just for wizards any more! Even the simple fighter, sword in hand, has a number of tactics and powers she can use to dash around the battlefield and carve up enemies, or leave her foes confused by a decoy while she prepares to unleash an ambush.\nThe Dungeonmans Academy\nAt the heart of the Dungeonmans story is the Academy, an ever-growing bastion of learning that expands and builds upon the success of its graduates. As heroes explore the world, they'll uncover lost artifacts, forgotten lore, and other curiosities that can be used to help the Academy grow. Future graduates will carry forward some of the power and knowledge earned by their predecessors, such as pre-identification of scrolls and potions or a leg up on powerful skills.\nMake plain the folly of they who think themselves above the rule of law!\nA wide world of adventure, generated just for you! Explore forests and badlands, smash through bandit barricades on the roads, visit peaceful hamlets, and plunder many different types of dungeons.\nExcellent character development variety! Use one of the starter classes to get yourself going, or go entirely classless and build however you like. There's always enough rope to hang yourself in Dungeonmans!\nTense, tactical combat that challenges you to make the most of your items and abilities to pull off upset victories against hordes of foes.\nThe Dungeonmans Academy, which grows according to your heroics and serves as a home base for the great adventures to come. Pass knowledge forward from graduate to graduate and grow ever stronger!\nA roguelike experience for everyone! Use the Academy to carry progress forward and soften the blow of permadeath, or cut your teeth on the rock-hard Ironmans mode.\nA huge collection of powerful loot and unique foes rendered with colorful, high-quality 2D art. Explore multiple and varied environments built with detailed tile sets from an era where gaming meant high adventure!\n\n\nFrom fierce contests across rolling battlefields to tense exploration in the darkest of depths, music pervades the entire tapestry of the Dungeonmans adventure. \nThe sweeping throwback score and sound effects for Dungeonmans have been created by veteran game composer Andrew Aversa (aka zircon), inspired by the very best RPG soundtracks of the 16bit era. The score even uses the same authentic orchestral sounds prevalent in games like Final Fantasy Tactics, Suikoden II, and many other classic titles.\nDon't forget! Any backer at the $25 or higher reward tiers will receive TWO additional albums full of zircon's awesome work. Check it out!\n\n\nBe the first to see what's out there!\nDownload the latest version of the Summer Preview and see for yourself: there's already lots of great adventure to be had in Dungeonmans! But the journey's not yet over, and I need your help to get there. I've had a long career as a AAA game developer, and for the last year independent development has been my full time job. Dungeonmans has come a long way from its humble beginnings, and now I'm coming forward with a playable and exciting adventure that I hope will convince you to support the game's completion. When this funding campaign succeeds, here are just some of the things you'll see in the final product:\nMore secrets, more challenge! Unlock hidden classes, solve the riddles of double secret endings, and face the titanic challenge of a monster-choked postgame that demands top tier play.\nLarger, more diverse environments! Stalk through murky swampland and dig for ruins in trackless deserts, each with unique hazards and dungeon types.\nMore playable races! Stand tall with the courageous Bravians or use the guile of the cunning Salamens. New races provide unique configurations of abilities, style, and gear. It's tough to wear rings when you don't have any fingers! \nExplore the wilds and tame the wilderness! Clear out nests of snarling beasts and put villains to the sword, making the way to settle new towns and expand civilization. This growth compliments the Academy, allowing your heroes faster travel and a stronger support network.\nI encourage you to play Dungeonmans and see for yourself what adventure awaits on the horizon. Check out the benefits of backing with the Pioneer's Guild and getting first access to future development builds, and see how your input and feedback help make Dungeonmans a better game.\nThere's nearly unlimited potential for adventure in Dungeonmans, and while I'd love to see each and every one of these expanded concepts in the final game, reaching higher levels of funding will make that task much easier.\n$45,000: A mystery class! In addition to the six different classes already in the game, a seventh challenger will show up to bring unique Masteries to the adventure. As with all other classes, you can pick and choose masteries as you please to create the perfect graduate and send him off to die in a dungeon. \n$50,000: Expand the Frontier: As the Academy grows and Dungeonmens push out into the wild, you'll be able to create entirely new settlements and guide the way they grow. Even though your heroes may perish, their legacy will live on as towns thrive and prosper thanks to your hard work. \n$65,000: Expanded Deluxe Soundtrack: If we reach this level, zircon will record additional music for the game in addition to upgrading the physical copies of the soundtrack to Deluxe editions with the complete score, out takes, and unique arrangements.\n$75,000: Linux and Mac versions. Dungeonmans is built with XNA, and while there are excellent alternatives out there, taking Dungeonmans to Linux and Mac requires non-trivial time and resources, especially for a single developer. At this level, I'll have the ability to make it happen. \n$90,000: Academy Evolution: Take control of Academy development in entirely new ways! Place classrooms and other buildings in specific locations, taking advantage of bonuses generated by positioning. Lay out roads, plant trees, and build other niceties to create the look and feel that suits you best. \n$100,000: The Airship! Take control of a fully functional flying machine to explore all parts of the world as well as face entirely new encounters. Ship to ship combat, with cannons and boarding action, as well as mysterious Sky Castles which contain wonders and dangers far beyond the terrestrial.\nDungeonmans needs your help to be the best game it can be.

However, as you can see by playing the Summer Preview, Dungeonmans is quite fleshed out and has a solid foundation on which to build additional content and lay on the polish. This number represents both the cost of future assets as well as business and cost of living for my given situation.\n\nYou're Overpromising!\n\nEvery developer needs to worry about this, especially when involved in a passionate project that they really enjoy. Working toward this Summer Preview has already given me great insight into the speed at which I can create content, and the tech required to make the content happen. However, games often slip on ship dates, and while that isn't my intent, it may happen.

However, I've got some good news I'd like to share with everyone.   \nGame Updates And Future Patches   \nOver the last two years, there have been quite a few content updates for the game. Lots of new loot and monsters, new dungeon types, even a whole new class: the Psychomanser. In addition, patches have been dedicated to revamping existing classes. The most recent patch revisited the Southern Gentlemans, increasing the effect of Ire, reworking some clumsy powers, and overall making it more interesting. The same goal is going into October's Wizardmans patch, which will polish up one of Dungeonmans' oldest classes.
