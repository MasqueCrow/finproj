The nefarious meerkats have agreed to help them in exchange for food. You must pilfer the unwanted food from the other animals without arousing the suspicion of the zookeeper. If they become too suspicious your escape attempt is doomed for failure. \nPilfering Pandas is a modern reinvention of a classic set collection card game that requires carefully timed & targeted actions. The key to winning is knowing when to sneak and pilfer more unwanted food from the Hideout (a spread of cards visible to all players) and when to stay put. Getting this wrong can be costly or even disastrous.\nPilfering Pandas has 3 game modes:\n Competitive: Players each attempt to make their escape, individually trying not to attract too much attention while hindering the escape attempts of their fellow pandas.\n Cooperative: All players work together to escape, always trying to stay one step ahead of the Zookeeper.\n Solo: Working on your own, your job is to get the help you need from the Meerkats and make your escape before the Zookeeper notices.\nAlthough the gameplay in Pilfering Pandas is easy to understand the strategy is harder to master. This means Pilfering Pandas is suited to both adults who like quick games but with lots of decision making as well as families (cooperative recommended for under 12s).\nWren Games is the wife and husband team Janice & Stu. As parents of 2 young children,we understand how hectic life can get, so we wanted to create a game that is accessible for busy people. Pilfering Pandas is our third game which aims to provide:\n Short playtimes. \n Depth of decisions. \n Intuitive gameplay. \nWe have multiple options for you to try before you buy including our very own solo implementation in the form of a digital app that's free to play throughout this Kickstarter. Get an overview of the rules here and then keep scrolling down to find out more about our app.\nWe also have these 4 gorgeous hard enamel pin badges (approx 1.5 in) up for grabs featuring the fabulous game art. We couldn't resist! \nIf you prefer watching to reading, here's a good video summary of Pilfering Pandas so you can learn all about this addictive little game. \n\nPilfering Pandas is a reinvention of a classic card game Janice played with her nan growing up (she knows it as Benny - tell us in the comments if you've heard of it!). \nAt its core, Pilfering Pandas is a set collection game, but it's not your typical set collection game. We've added lots of twists added to bring about a brisk game with depth to decisions. \nTo achieve this depth, we've made a ton of changes, not least creating cooperative and solo modes. Pilfering Pandas plays similarly in all 3 game modes but with some key  differences making each game mode a different experience. \nA typical turn on the surface looks deceptively simple, making Pilfering Pandas quick and easy to teach to others. However the strategy is harder to master. A turn will look something like this: \nPick up 1 or more cards.\nPlay sets to the table and/or pass.\nAdvance marker(s).\nDiscard a card.\nSets of 3 or more cards can be played in any of the following ways:\nSo at this point you might be thinking, isn't this just Rummy? And the answer is no, it's a lot more than Rummy. Here are a few of the key differences:\nSets are played to the table (Meerkats) and not kept in hand.\nThere's no hand limit or action limit.\nYou can pick-up more than 1 card from the discard pile (Hideout).\nTo play a new set, you must match the suit or number of the last card in the previous set played.\nYou can chain sets, doubling points if you reuse a card in an already played set.\nEach player has a special power or challenge based on their pandas character.\nA wild card in a set can be taken back (or stolen) or discarded to slow down the zookeeper.\nIn cooperative and solo games, the zookeeper is constantly chasing you.\n The Hideout \nPerhaps the most interesting mechanism in Pilfering Pandas is the Hideout. The Hideout is where you 'discard' a card at the end of your turn, but unlike traditional discard piles, the Hideout is not a pile, it's a spread of cards visible to all players. For a fee, you can pick up as many cards as you want from it,  making huge plays of sets in a single turn possible (there's only a hand limit in solo games). \nThe Hideout acts like a communal hand in cooperative games (like an extension of your hand in solo games) where you all work together to build sets ready for one lucky person to pick up. However, the strategy is reversed  in competitive gameplay. Not only are you looking for cards in there that you might want, but you are also actively trying to prevent any sets being created that one of the other players could grab before you do. This means you should think carefully before discarding that card your opponent might be looking for! \nCompetitive Gameplay \nIn competitive gameplay, players attempt to make their own escape, trying not to attract too much attention from the zookeeper and making sure no other pandas escape. There can be only one panda on the loose.\nCooperative Gameplay\nIn cooperative gameplay, all players work together to escape, always trying to stay one step ahead of the zookeeper who automatically advances 1 space every turn. What you do on your turn directly affects how much closer you are to escaping, as well as how much closer the zookeeper gets to catching you.\nSolo Gameplay\nIn solo gameplay, you are working on your own to ensure the escape of the pandas from the zoo. Your job is to get the help you need from the Meerkats and make your escape before the Zookeeper notices.  \nTry Pilfering Pandas for yourself in any of the following ways:\nDownload the DRAFT Rules [Note: Coop/Solo rules still being updated from rules editor]\nTry the PnP \nDownload our free app: Android | iOS \nPlay on Tabletop Simulator \nPlay on Tabletopia \nJoin an online demo: keep an eye on our Facebook Group and in the updates to learn how to join.\nDigital App\nThe digital app is free to download and play through-out the Kickstarter.

We are planning to have a fulfilment centre both in Germany (close to where we manufacture) and in the UK. \nBoth UK and EU VAT will be taken care of and will not be charged additionally. Countries outside of UK / EU have the tax used to subsidise shipping costs. We are also customs friendly in the following locations.\nGiven the ever changing shipping costs due to Brexit and Covid these  estimates only are based on current shipping prices and final shipping partner. Our exact shipping partners will depend on the final number of backers and shipping costs at the time of dispatch. \nThe estimated shipping prices are:\nPlease note we cannot ship to the following locations: Afghanistan, Brazil, Cuba, Haiti, Iran, Iraq, Kazakhstan, Burma (Myanmar), North Korea, Russia, Syria, Ukraine and Yemen.\nWhy are the ranges so large for shipping costs?\nShipping is the trickiest thing to estimate during a Kickstarter, especially now. We've done our very best to give you the most transparent view based on the quotes we have but we can't predict the future. This is why the ranges in some cases are quite large. The differences between suppliers are large and we cannot guarantee that the cheapest supplier will hold that price until we fulfil. \nWe will use the most cost effective shipping method when the time comes, but with COVID surcharges,  we just don't know what the cost will be in 6-9 months time. Therefore the above are rough estimates of shipping costs, but we're confident we won't go above the upper limits and when we come to contracting a fulfilment centre, we will be targeting the lower end of the range.\n\nConnect With Us\nNewsletter\nFacebook Group\nTwitter\nInstagram\nFacebook Page", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nFor the first time we are splitting fulfilment between the UK and EU to ensure both UK and EU friendly delivery. This means that we are likely to be working with a partner that we haven't worked with before which always brings risks. However, we will only work with a partner that we know has positive recommendations and who we trust.\n\nCOVID and BREXIT also bring risks as both are affecting the world and in particular logistics in a continuing and unpredictable way. We have estimated shipping to the best of our ability, and have included best and worst case estimates to ensure you know the full picture. We'll keep you informed through of what's happening and any decision we make.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nSustainable Distribution\nWhere possible we use 'local' suppliers. We are manufacturing the playmats in the UK and the game in Germany. We have also chosen a fulfilment centre in Germany to minimise the travel the games need to do.

Since lockdown we have been looking at ways to bring the experience to your home at an affordable price, solving clues to get through a door without being locked in a room, truly...thinking outside the box.\n\n\"I bought this calendar for an early teen and they loved it. The puzzles were excellent. We are definitely buying again for next year!! \"     - Customer review\n\nEach A3 sized calendar has a unique design that will engage your mind with an array of Christmas related puzzles.  Some will be quick to solve, some have to be unscrambled and some may need to be decoded with the help of the back of the advent calendar. \n\n\n\nWHO ARE WE?\nWe are Escape Room designers who have been creating Escape Room experiences in Peterborough UK.

It means that more puzzles can be made, it opens up the area inside the advent window to be an extra playable area. The detached door can now be used elsewhere on the calendar, cut up or folded to find the solution.\n\n\"The mix of puzzles was great.

Sean Molley", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Our intrepid author Paige Turner is back!  In Paperback Adventures, you get to play as the protagonist in one of Paige's wild brainstorming sessions. Conquer a menagerie of pulp novel characters in this solo deckbuilding word game.\nJust like in the original game Paperback\u2014and its follow up, Hardback\u2014you will build your own deck of cards throughout the game, and those cards will have letters to help you spell words every turn. But in Paperback Adventures, instead of testing your wordsmithing wit against other players, you will use your words to defeat a series of AI enemies in \"roguelike\" fashion.\nPaperback Adventures is a solo-focused game. It was designed from the ground up as a strategic, highly-replayable solo word game. There are also additional gameplay variants for cooperative play between two players.\nHere are the stretch goals we've unlocked!\nCommunity Stretch Goals\nPart of what makes Kickstarter great is the opportunity to hear what matters most to backers. Here are some of the additions and changes we\u2019ve made thanks to our backers\u2019 feedback.\nAs the game developed and grew, we wanted every character to have their own cards and unique styles of play, but with the Fowers Games history of small box games we also wanted to keep an affordable price point for the game. So we decided on a modular system that lets you play the game whether you buy one character or several.\nHere's what the Paperback Adventures core box contains:\nRulebook\nEnemy Tray with Tokens (designed by Game Trayz\u2122)\n12 Enemy Cards\n12 Reward Cards\n7 Penalty Cards\n7 Enemy Vowel and \"?\" Cards\n26 Item Cards\n26 McGuffin Cards\n7 Penalty Card Sleeves\nAs long as you have at least one character box, the core box contains everything else you need to play the game. The core box also has space to store the bonus content from each of your character boxes (note: not all content from those boxes), allowing you to set up a new game more quickly.\nSo what comes in a character box? Each protagonist in Paperback Adventures plays distinctly, with different core items, starting items, and a unique 10-card starting deck. Additionally, every protagonist has their own growth deck of 50 cards that offers different paths and playstyles every game session.\nBut a character box doesn't only provide new content when you choose that character. Inside each character box you'll also find a few new enemies and a few new bonus items and McGuffins that go into your core box and add additional content no matter which character you pick for a given game.\nEach character box has bonus enemies, items, and double-sided McGuffins (like this one!)\nThe more character boxes you add, the more variety and wacky combinations you get. \nHere's what comes in each character box:\nCharacter Tray with Tokens (designed by Game Trayz\u2122)\nCharacter Card\n6 Enemy Cards\n6 Reward Cards\n60 Letter Cards\n6 Core Item Cards\n4 Bonus Item Cards\n4 Bonus McGuffin Cards\n60 Letter Card Sleeves\nThe protagonists are not only unique from a gameplay standpoint, they also come from wildly different genres and have their own graphical style and artistic design. Here are the playable characters in Paperback Adventures:\nOur final character is a Pirate\u2014he is currently awaiting a proper name to be voted on by the backers!\nWord-heavy playstyle\nBarrage cards get bonuses for longer words\nCan drain the enemy's life!\nCan copy the effect of an item\u2014effectively using it twice\nCrew cards come back from the fatigue pile\nTry out the Tabletop Simulator demo on Steam!\nIn a single game of Paperback Adventures, your protagonist will face off against nine randomized enemies of escalating difficulty.  To make matters worse, your health total persists from enemy to enemy. Luckily for you, each enemy also offers randomized rewards to help you power up quickly to meet the challenge. \nYou'll need to beat each enemy one by one by spelling words with the cards in your hand. Each card has symbols that either damage the enemy, block the enemy's incoming damage to you, or provide you with mana so you can use your items. You'll also be able to activate the unique ability of one of your cards.\nThe game is divided in a trilogy structure, where you'll battle two normal enemies and a boss for each \"book\" in the trilogy. You can stop a game session after completing one book (~45 min) or even after any enemy through a \"save game\" feature that will keep your current deck, items, and rewards separate in the game's box. To beat the game, you'll need to defeat all nine enemies in the trilogy.\nOne goal from the outset of this game's design was to find ways to streamline the typical deckbuilding roguelike experience found in digital games for tabletop play. Two essential systems deliver the gameplay variation and combos needed for the genre while keeping player upkeep at a minimum: the splay system and the hex and boon counter system.\nYour word is ready\u2014which way will you splay?\n When you spell words each turn in Paperback Adventures, you'll need to also choose which way to splay your word, so that only one edge of each card is showing except for the top card. The only card ability visible will be on the top card, and that's the ability you activate. Here's an example of how it works:\nWhen you splay left, you count all the icons on the left edge of each card. The top card is the last letter of the word.\nWhen you splay right you count all the icons on the right edge of each card. The top card is the first letter of the word.\nThe splay system forces you to make tough choices\u2014do you want more blocks or more hits this turn? Or maybe which card is your top card matters most. To make that decision even tougher (and to keep every battle moving), the top card also gets fatigued for the rest of the battle. You'll get it back for the next enemy, though!\nHex and boon counters allow protagonists and enemies to support a wide range of playstyles without adding too many rules and overhead for players to track. Hex counters affect the character they are on negatively, while boon counters affect the character they are on positively. So these counters are always contextual--one enemy's hex counters might cause accelerating damage, while another enemy's hex counters limit your card draw.\nHere is a link to the current working rulebook for Paperback Adventures\nWe know that some players will want a tougher challenge, especially after completing a few runs. So we\u2019ll be including a system called Plot Twists.\nEvery Plot Twist comes with two distinct challenges, one on top and one on bottom, for the entirety of your run. Here is one condition card unlocked earlier in the campaign:\nEach challenge has a difficulty number assigned to it, with \u201c1\u201d being the lowest difficulty. Before starting a run, you can choose an overall challenge level for your run and then mix and match challenges from the various Plot Twists until the collective difficulty numbers add up to your desired challenge level. This way, you can experience brand new challenge combinations while also making the game better fit your experience and skill level.\nYou can splay the Plot Twists underneath your player tray, showing only the new rules from your chosen challenges so that you can quickly reference them. Those rules will stay the same throughout your run.\nWhile Paperback Adventures was designed from the start as a solo experience, we also knew that people would enjoy playing it with others. We\u2019ve been playtesting and working behind the scenes to bring some two player variants to the table that not only open up a seat for an additional player but also open up new ways to approach the game.\nTwo-Headed Giant\nThis cooperative mode really leans into the idea of co-op play. The two players must work in tandem using the same character, deck, and token tracker. But here\u2019s the kicker: you split your starting items and McGuffins between the two of you. Additionally, you alternate taking turns, which means your items and McGuffins are only available half the time. Anytime you gain an item or McGuffin, you both gain one!\nA lot of the fun in this variant comes from working together to find the best words and setting each other up for big turns. Don\u2019t just take our word for it though; check out this gameplay video where we show off the mode over a couple different enemy fights.\nDouble Trouble\nIn the Double Trouble mode, each player has their own character to play! They team up against a pair of enemies, but they must coordinate their attacks and share certain resources\u2014like the wild card!  (To make this possible, one enemy uses the tray from the unused character.)\n Paperback Playthrough with Aaron of GameEnthus and designer Skye Larsen\nPlaythrough from a Live Stream with Ruel Gaviola on Tabletop Tonight\nBook 2 Gameplay from a Live Stream with Richmond of BramBeard Gaming\nJason Perez with One Stop Co-op Shop\nYou won't get too far in a roguelike without sweet loot. Reward cards for each enemy will give you two options to choose from. You have to choose which set of loot is more important to keep progressing.\nItems provide powerful effects that can be used once per turn, but you'll need mana to activate most of them.  \nExamples of a McGuffin and item with completed art\nMcGuffins are always double-sided, and you'll get to choose which McGuffin will help you more. These powerups provide modest effects, but don't require mana for use. Find the right ones for some spectacular combos!\nEvery character letter card is also upgradeable. When a reward says you upgrade a card, flip the card over and put it back in its sleeve. Some card upgrades add extra icons to the card, while others improve or even alter the card ability.\n\n Shipping will be charged in our post-campaign pledge manager after the campaign.  We ship customs friendly.\n Tim Fowers, co-designer, has piloted many successful games including Burgle Bros, Fugitive, and Paperback \n Skye Larsen, co-designer, has finally justified his Creative Writing degree (sort of)\n Jeff Krause, development, worked with Tim on Sabotage and Burgle Bros 2 \n Ryan Goldsberry, illustrator, helps bring all of Tim's games to life\n Noah Adelman, product design, has designed components and storage solutions for many successful games through his company Game Trayz\u2122\n We'd also like to thank Andrew Colin Beck for our logo design, Nate Stebbing for the animation work in our Kickstarter video, and Fernando Cunha for our gameplay animations on this page.\nWe will use a pledge manager to help our backers get their copy of Paperback Adventures as quickly as possible.

Wasted Wilds has unlocked all 22 stretch goals, including 4 new apocalypses (Plantpocalypse, Smart Apes, Underground, Fascist Soldiers), component upgrades, a huge supplemental mission book, legacy campaign content and an additional survivor in the Beekeeper. \nMaximum Apocalypse: Wasted Wilds is the much anticipated continuation of the hit cooperative roguelike game series. It features the same compelling survival gameplay but adds two distinct campaigns with a lot of new twists around exposure to the elements and interactions with other survivors. \nWasted Wilds can be played as a stand-alone 1-4 player campaign, or combined with the contents of any other Maximum Apocalypse game or expansion to support up to 6 players.  Survivors from Maximum Apocalypse, Kaiju Rising, Gothic Horrors and Jurassic Perils are all fully playable in this game. Plus any of the new survivors from Wasted Wilds can be played in the other Maximum Apocalypse games as well!\nIf you're unfamiliar with Maximum Apocalypse, it is a cooperative roguelike game filled with adventure, exploration, survival and strategic choices. It was built from the ground up to be very modular and infinitely replayable.  Maximum Apocalypse has inspired a Role Playing Game and spawned numerous expansions featuring everything from Bugs, C'thulhu and Kaiju. There is a vast wasteland out there to explore and Wasted Wilds has been designed as the perfect starting point! The Frozen Wilds campaign walks players through a mission by mission tutorial that will ease new players into the experience.\nThis graphic does not include additional Stretch Goal Content (see below)\nWe always like to offer more to our Kickstarter backers. We're going to try something new for this campaign and will be giving everyone the opportunity to vote and influence the path we take on this crowdfunding adventure together.  Over the course of the campaign, the community will not only direct which stretch goals come next, but also unlock and design some of that content together. Be sure to check the campaign daily!\nWasted Wilds features a brand new set of survivors with all new skills and mechanics, along with new apocalypses, enemies and two distinct campaigns.  Here is a quick rundown of what's new in Wasted Wilds:\n The Driver is an impulsive ex-stuntwoman who relies on her adrenaline to get her through tough situations.  She comes with her own custom car that can mow down enemies and can even move the Van tile for easier escapes.\n The Chef is a support class who uses his knowledge of the kitchen to aid his fellow survivors.  He focuses on staving off hunger and is deadly with his many knives.\n The Contractor is a strong warrior with a big appetite.  His innate ability allows him to build barricades which prevent future monster spawns.\n The Thief is a stealthy rogue who evades danger and strikes from the shadows.  She grows in strength as she makes her way through her 50 card survivor deck, setting up crucial assassinations.\n\nThe Frozen Wilds & Scorched Wasteland\nWasted Wilds focuses on the environmental impact of apocalyptic events such as Nuclear Winter and Global Warming.  There are two distinct campaigns: The Frozen Wilds and Scorched Wasteland, that task players with surviving many different types of apocalypses, monsters and events as you progress through each campaign.  Our Mission Book and Learn to Play guide makes learning the game and its new mechanics easy for new and old players alike.  Each mission explains setup, shows example map layouts, lists each objective and how to escape with your life:\nOur Learn to Play Guide simplifies the rule set and eases players into the experience. As you progress through the Frozen Wilds campaign, you will slowly be introduced to new game mechanics and threats such as exposure to elements, parlaying with other tribes of human survivors, monster tokens moving during the day and night effects.\n\nTime is Against You!\nWasted Wilds organizes its new mechanics into a Clock board.  Time is always ticking along in Wasted Wilds. Every turn advances the clock, but rolling a '7' increases the passage of time and might trigger Exposure or another effect!\nExposure: Survivors will be facing extreme conditions and will need to stay inside to avoid exposure to the elements.  Survivors that are exposed (located on outdoor tiles) will draw negative status effects from the Exposure deck. It might start off as frostnip, but can grow into pneumonia or worse.  The Exposure deck allows us to introduce apocalyptic dangers outside of the traditional monster deck.\nDon't get stuck outdoors when Exposure strikes\nDay/Night: Day and Night effects were introduced in the Gothic Horrors expansion. During the day, monster tokens move around the map.   When Night falls, events trigger that will help or hinder your progress.\nParlay with NPCs to get them on your side\nTribes: The biggest enemy that you will face in Wasted Wilds is humanity itself.  Groups of survivors have created their own tribes.  These enemies are more complex than your standard apocalyptic monsters, you can parlay with them and trade items to turn their opposition into an alliance.\n\nStreamlined Setup\nEverything in Wasted Wilds aims to get players into the game quicker. All of the hard-to-organize map tiles have been streamlined into a \"scorched\" and \"frozen\" set that you can easily keep separate and store between missions using our storage system. There's no need to search through all the map tiles to get the right set for a mission any longer.\nThis is also true for the Scavenge Decks.  The Red, Green and Blue scavenge decks are the same for every mission in Wasted Wilds.  We've made sure that every scavenge card features a colored icon indicating which deck it belongs to so that you can easily sort them. Each Scavenge deck can then be stored in the correct storage tray between play sessions for faster setup.\nThe Time Traveler Expansion, designed by Todd Walsh (Set a Watch) and inspired by his love of Sci-Fi, features a quirky survivor who is great at avoiding combat. Whenever the Traveler is used, you also introduce their Time Pod tile, which you can use to teleport around the map.  Of course when you rip through space time there are bound to be consequences. You will have to watch out for time anomalies as well...\nStep inside the mind of Gustav Rangmar, the artist behind Maximum Apocalypse, for the creation of its memorable characters, imaginative creatures and post-apocalyptic world. The Art of the Apocalypse is an amazing collection for fans of the series. It gives you a glimpse into the creative process, Gustav's favorite pieces, and all of the work that goes into crafting a game world like this one throughout its 120+ pages.  \nThe Redhead first appeared as a promotional Gunslinger in the very first Maximum Apocalypse campaign. Now, she's finally getting a proper expansion focused on the lore of the indie comic of the same name. The Few and Cursed Expansion features the Redhead's \"Curse Chaser\" deck from the Few and Cursed board game along with new monster decks and tiles that focus on a new 'Cursed' status effect. Special Thanks to Felipe Cagno and Fabiano Neves on trusting us with their IP and making this idea happen!\nThe Allies of the Rapture expansion compiles all of the extra Kickstarter Exclusive content from our previous campaigns. This includes the solo focused Allies expansion, the Rapture apocalypse, murder clowns and gremlin monsters. If you missed out on the KS version of Gothic Horrors, this expansion is for you! This content is already included in the Legendary Edition.\nLast but not least we will have new Wasted Wilds play mats available for bundling in the pledge manager:\nWe will be offering other Maximum Apocalypse products like the Legendary edition, Gothic Horrors Kickstarter edition, RPG books etc. in the pledge manager, but their quantity will be limited based on existing stock in each region. You can also visit shop.rockmanorgames.com and get in stock games shipped ASAP and have them before the end of this campaign!\nWe love to work with retailers from all around the world. Brick and Mortar Retailers who back at our retailer pledge will help support this Kickstarter and be invited to order Kickstarter exclusive content for their stores. All retailers will be able to order at 50% OFF MSRP.  No Minimum Orders. Orders of 6+ will get free shipping (in most countries).

Based on previous campaigns, we anticipate that you should not have any additional fees associated with receiving your rewards (customs, duties, clearance, etc.) if you\u2019re in one of these regions.

You have humans. The humans have problems. Use your magical powers to solve their problems and save the day!\n\u2b50 A roleplaying game designed for all ages to enjoy, that excels as an introduction to the hobby.\n\u2b50 The elegantly simple rules system puts the emphasis on storytelling and supports a setting and characters that players are familiar with and love from the start.\nEvery Magical Kitty has a human. Every human has a Problem. In Magical Kitties Save the Day, you need to use your magical powers to solve problems and save the day. But kitties live in Hometowns that are filled with witches, aliens, hyper-intelligent raccoons, and other foes. They make human problems worse, so the kitties need to go on adventures to stop them before that can happen.\nThe Deluxe Edition of Magical Kitties Save the Day SOLD OUT just a few months after its original Kickstarter. Now we\u2019re bringing it back as a special release not available via distribution. It\u2019s packed full of high-quality component upgrades like wooden tokens and custom dice, and a bunch of bonus content including the Magical Power, Talent, and Flaw cards, and two extra Hometowns with maps.\nBut don\u2019t worry if you\u2019re missing a few Magical Kitties books for the Standard Edition you already bought. We\u2019ve made them all available as add-ons for this campaign so you can easily complete your collection!\nIf you\u2019ve been looking for a way to introduce your friends and family to roleplaying games, Magical Kitties is the perfect game to do it!\nWhen you open the box, sitting right on top is Magical Kitties & The Big Adventure, a solo-play graphic novel adventure. This action-packed comic book is also a full scenario! Within moments, you\u2019ll be able to create your magical kitty and go on an amazing adventure that will also teach you how to play the game.\nAfter that, older players can be the game master for kids as young as six years old (and everyone else who loves kitties). And it's an excellent game for kids to start running on their own. Even if you\u2019ve never played a roleplaying game, Magical Kitties includes the tools and guidance for both first-time roleplayers and first-time GMs.\nWhether you\u2019ve played board games with roleplaying elements, watched actual play videos, or just think roleplaying games sound like a lot of fun and you want to give them a try, Magical Kitties can be your first step into a larger world of fun.\nIn Magical Kitties Save the Day, one player \u2014 known as the game master (GM) \u2014 has a very special role. They describe the world in which the magical kitties live to the other players and, when the kitties take action, they use the rules of the game to figure out what happens next.\nPlaying Magical Kitties is easy. You have 3 Attributes \u2013 Cute, Cunning, and Fierce. You also have a Talent, a Flaw, and a Magical Power. When your kitty is trying to do something difficult, you\u2019ll build a pool of six-sided dice with:\n\u2b50 A number of dice equal to the attribute you\u2019re using (Cute, Cunning, or Fierce)\n\u2b50 An extra die if you\u2019re using your Talent\n\u2b50 Two extra dice if you\u2019re using your Power\nThe game master sets a difficulty (a number from 3 to 6) and then you roll your dice pool. Each die that rolls equal to or higher than the difficulty is a success. The number of successes you rolled determines the outcome:\nIn Magical Kitties Save the Day, it\u2019s not just a question of whether or not you succeed: It\u2019s about how you succeed. The complications and bonuses generated by most outcomes drive the action forward in unexpected and exciting ways. You and your friends will discover the story together!\n\nOTHER FUN GAMEPLAY ELEMENTS:\n\u2b50 Character generation takes just 5 minutes.\n\u2b50 The dice are always in the players' hands, not the GM's.\n\u2b50 Players get Kitty Treats that let them change the story. You earn Kitty Treats by roleplaying your Flaw.\n\u2b50 No one ever dies in Magical Kitties. If you take too many Owies, you get knocked out or otherwise \u201cincapacitated\u201d for the scene.\n\u2b50 You get XP every time you fail a roll. And for saving the day, of course!\n\nPOWER UP! SOURCEBOOK AT A GLANCE:\n\u2b50 36 all-new powers for your magical kitties!\n\u2b50 Epic foes, epic powers, and epic stunts for taking your game to the next level!\n\u2b50 Guidelines for designing your own powers, bonus features, and more.\nOriginal Magical Kitties creator Matthew J.

We work to minimize such charges, but every country and courier has its own regulations, rates, practices, and policies.\nWe ship your rewards ourselves. Rewards will ship from the Atlas Games warehouse in Duluth, Minnesota, USA. Based on our experience, this is more reliable and ultimately less expensive than a collection of global fulfillment warehouses. In part due to our direct control of this facility, our shipping operations have remained both open and safe during the global pandemic.\nRetailers get their usual terms. Retail tier backers pay shipping later, if at all, using Atlas Games\u2019 standard direct-to-retail sales terms for shipping.

We will send games to our partner warehouses in these regions in order to keep the shipping costs as low as possible for you. This also means that we will cover the cost of import duties and custom fees to these regions ourselves, so you don\u2019t have to.\n\nVAT\nThe EU has recently implemented stricter tax regulations on online sales in general and crowdfunding in particular. We thus are obliged to collect and pay VAT on the value of the total of the pledge and shipping amount according to the VAT rates of each respective country.  VAT will be charged in the pledge manager.\nIt is important to note that VAT is a sales tax that is separate from import taxes or duties. We will cover import duties in the USA, Europe, UK, Canada, China and Australia so you do not have to worry about those. Other regions will probably incur import duties.\nMighty Boards aims to create immersive board game experiences with gorgeous game design, intense challenges and evocative stories. We believe that a game depends on its rules, stories and the visuals and pieces that express them. While our games span a variety of thematic and mechanical genres, they have one thing in common, which we like to think of as something of a mission statement: the tight coupling of rich,  evocative theme and meaty, engaging mechanics.\nOur talented team, based in Malta, places great importance on these innovative mechanics that stimulate the imagination. Every product goes through rigorous development and a solid testing process to make sure we deliver only top-quality products. At Mighty Boards, we go all in to bring you a great gaming experience.\n\nTerms and Conditions\nWhen you pledge for our games you are agreeing to the following terms and conditions:\nKICKSTARTER EXCLUSIVITY:  Kickstarter Exclusive items like the Overkill Promo Pack will not enter regular distribution. However, they will be available in limited supply at conventions, through contests, online at the BGG promo store, and directly from Mighty Boards on our website.\nREFUND POLICY Mighty Boards follows the standard Kickstarter terms for refund. This means that we will provide a full refund if the request is received within 14 days from the end of the campaign. Any request made after this period will be at the discretion of Mighty Boards and will be a maximum of 90% of the pledge cost due to Kickstarter and card fees already paid by Mighty Boards.\nRETURNING PRODUCTS If you fail to accept your package when it is delivered we will not issue a refund for the cost of the pledge.\nDAMAGED PRODUCTS  We guarantee that the packages you receive from us will be complete and include all the items in perfect condition. We will replace any missing or damaged items. In the case of minor cosmetic damage to external boxes replacement will be decided on a case by case basis.\nSURVEY RESPONSE  We use CrowdOx as a pledge manager. You will be required to fill a survey on that platform. We will send out several emails and updates notifying you of the deadline to fill the survey. If you do not fill out the survey by this deadline after notifications have been sent, we may not be able to send you your pledge.\nREASONABLE CHANGES TO PRODUCT We will keep testing and developing the game until it\u2019s as close to perfect as possible. Due to this and potential improvements suggested by the factory the final product may be different from the prototype shown on this page. By pledging to this project you acknowledge that the final game may be different from that presented in this Kickstarter campaign. Having said this, Mighty Boards will make every effort to keep the final game as close to the Kickstarter project as possible and only make changes to improve the game. Mighty Boards will also inform backers of the major changes and reasons for such changes.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nVengeance: Roll and Fight has already been developed and tested extensively both by our internal developers, as well as externally through playtesters, early reviewers and dedicated friends, family and fans. Both episodes of the base game are close to completion and ready to head to manufacturing. Stretch goals remain to be tested and developed, according to the goals met. However, we are certain that we will be able to meet the design, development and production deadlines we have communicated on the project timeline displayed above.\n\nWe have already identified potential manufacturers, all of whom have been trusted partners on previous projects.

We won't lie; our missions are no walk in the park.\nRead on to see if you've got what it takes.\n Receive a package to your door! Our packages are delivered direct to you, filled with incredible puzzles and a deep, immersive world.\n Team up or play alone! You can play by yourself, with your partner, or with a group of friends or colleagues. Each of the packages should last between 90 and 120 minutes.\n Interact with the world! Contact the characters by email or Whatsapp, hack into their online banking, or research website content to help solve the puzzles.\n Become immersed in the story! Put yourself into the shoes of the detective to solve The Cursed Exhibition.\n Continue your journey! Each package follows on from the previous one, presenting you with new challenges and exciting plot twists.\nPhysical Items\nAt the heart of each episode is the package that will be delivered through your door. Inside you will find a range of different items, which you will need to solve the case. \nInteractive Technology\nTo create a truly modern detective experience, all members of the Society will need to examine digital sources as well as the physical ones in the package.\nOur bespoke communication systems allow players to converse with characters via email and SMS/Whatsapp.\nOur detailed and immersive websites create complex online worlds for detectives to explore as they search for answers.\nExhaustive Clue System\nEven the best detectives can require a little help. That's why we've created an innovative and exhaustive clue system to enable detectives to get a little assistance should they require it.\nOur master detective Lucid Montgomery takes a look over every case that comes through our door and is kind enough to write down a few prompts for each part of each episode in case a detective is in need of assistance.\nWelcoming Community\nWe have already collected together an incredible bunch of detectives on our dedicated Facebook and Reddit groups.\nThese amazing detectives discuss and share their findings, assisting each other when they get stuck and pointing out hidden tidbits that some might have missed (while flagging spoilers, of course).\nWe know some detectives like to work alone, but for those that don't, you will find the community a welcoming place for you to discuss the cases.\nWe won \"Best Mystery Game\" in the 2020 Bullseye Awards\nWe need your help Detectives!\nWe have to find out more about what is happening at the museum.\nIt's a matter of life and death.\n------------------------------\nWe're delighted to bring all of our backers three exclusive puzzles over the course of the Kickstarter campaign.\nThese mini-puzzles will reveal more about the mission ahead and reveal a horrifying secret about the museum and the dangers that lie in wait.\nTo take part, make sure you've pledged and are keeping an eye on our Kickstarter updates. \nAll three parts are now live.\nWe hope you enjoy.\nWe are very excited to be able to offer you the chance to add-on our existing adventures to your pledge, and get them at a discounted price.\nThe Disappearance of Claire Makova - when the daughter of a high-profile diplomat goes missing, you are hired to track her down before its too late.\nThe Sudden Silence of Timothy Lee - a young man falls into an inexplicable coma, can you unravel the mysterious secrets behind his illness?\nThe add-ons will be shipped in July 2021, alongside Episode One of The Cursed Exhibition.\nSo what made us decide to launch The Cursed Exhibition on Kickstarter?\nKickstarter is a hugely helpful way for us to plan for the costs of producing our games and the complex logistics involved in putting them together.\nBy pre-selling on Kickstarter, we know how ambitious we can be with our plans for The Cursed Exhibition. The huge support we received for The Disappearance of Claire Makova and The Sudden Silence of Timothy Lee meant we could do so much more than we originally planned.\nEvery copy that's purchased on Kickstarter contributes to extra design features, video work, voiceovers, interactive elements, digital content and physical box contents. Simply put, the more you support us the more we'll be able to do.\nWe're a small company, but we have big ideas and your support makes them a reality.\nWe are pleased to say that we ship worldwide! You can view the shipping costs in the table below:\nWe do not charge the full shipping fee to our customers. We absorb some of the cost ourselves.\nTaxes and Duties\nUK\nAll of our games are manufactured and shipped from the UK and so we are able to guarantee tax-free delivery.\nEuropean Union\nFollowing Brexit, we are continuing to work hard to find a reliable, monthly, duty-free method of delivery to our EU customers. We are hopeful that we will have this fully in place by the time we start shipping The Cursed Exhibition. \nHowever, if we are unable to do this then we will again give all backers the option to receive all six games in one package, delivered duty-free, which will be shipped after the final episode of the season has been released. \nUSA, Canada & The Rest of the World\nWe take all precautions to ensure that customers outside of the UK and EU pay no customs or import fees - including attaching CN22 forms - although we cannot guarantee your parcel will not be held at customs or have additional fees applied. \nIf you have had board games sent to you in the past from the UK without issues, then there is a good chance the same will happen with The Detective Society's games.\nThe Cursed Exhibition is made up of six episodes and if you buy the whole season you will receive one per month. We'll ship each of the episodes to all players simultaneously. This will help avoid any spoilers, whilst also giving all players the chance, if they wish, to experience each episode at the same time as every other player, making it an exciting 'live' event.\nDo you need to have played previous The Detective Society games to play The Cursed Exhibition?\nAbsolutely not! This is a brand new, six-episode standalone adventure that requires no previous knowledge of our old cases.\nHow do the pledge levels work?\nIf you pledge for \u201cFirst Package\u201d then you will receive your package shipped at the same time as everybody else, at the end of July 2021. You can then choose to buy the rest of the season, either via a subscription or by buying the packages individually when they are released.\nIf you pledge for \u201cAll Six Packages\u201d then you are purchasing the whole adventure; you will receive one episode every month. The story will run alongside your life for the entire six months!\nAny add-ons you purchase will be shipped at the same time as the first episode of The Cursed Exhibition.\nWho can play the game?\nThe game can be played solo, with a partner, or with a group of friends or colleagues and is recommended for players aged over 14 years, due to the peril the characters find themselves faced with.\nWhen will we deliver?\nEpisode One will be produced and shipped in late July 2021, with the subsequent five episodes being shipped monthly from then on.\nIt's always been important to us that we deliver what we promise on schedule, and we have achieved that with our two previous Kickstarters.\nAll our processes and supply chains have been established from the production of The Disappearance of Claire Makova and The Sudden Silence of Timothy Lee and that will continue seamlessly as we move into the production of The Cursed Exhibition.\nWhat if I already have a subscription to the Society?\nFirstly; thank you for supporting us! If you already have a subscription with The Detective Society, you do not need to pledge on Kickstarter to receive The Cursed Exhibition. It will automatically be delivered to you as part of your monthly schedule.\nThe Cursed Exhibition is being designed by the same people that brought you the previous Detective Society games - Joe Mills and Tristan Rogers - while Dan Wiseman is in charge of the business operations.\nBefore creating The Detective Society, Joe was instrumental in the success of some of the best escape games that London has to offer. His journey began with Time Run, ('fifth best escape room company in the world' in 2018); before moving onto Sherlock: The Game Is Now - the official BBC TV series tie-in. He also created and launched one of Design My Night's top picks for a night out in London: the immersive puzzle-based cocktail experience, The Case of the Poisoned Chalice. Joe takes the lead when it comes to creating all the puzzles.\nTristan is a game designer, actor and award-winning writer. He's worked in some of London's top theatres and has written on numerous programmes for BBC Radio. He\u2019s worked with Joe designing puzzles at various escape games, most recently penning the plot for The Case of The Poisoned Chalice. Tristan is in charge of overseeing the narrative of the cases.\nDan is our managing director and brings his vast business and marketing experience to the team. For over 10 years he has been building and operating successful businesses, including a digital marketing agency. He is connected to the The Detective Society through a mutual love of all things gaming-related, evidenced by his constant stream of RPG game ideas. Dan made his first RPG when he was just 13 years old. Dan ensures that we deliver on our promises.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs with any project, there are of course various risks and challenges involved - problems with design, procurement and shipping can all occur. However, our extensive work creating our previous two seasons means we have lots of experience to draw on. We have established good relationships with our key suppliers, and we are now very well versed in the processes required to release one episode a month. Our budgets are thorough, and we have built in significant contingency to deal with those issues we cannot foresee.\n\nOf course there is one major factor which is outside of our control. Covid-19 continues to spread across the world, and its existence has underpinned the lifespan of our young company. As we have existed with it for so long, we are confident we can deal with what the current situation throws at us. We are in regular contact with our suppliers, all of whom continue to operate as normal. Initially it impacted on the delivery timescales of our suppliers, but - at present - those have returned to their normal estimated delivery times. However, things can change quickly and disruption to our supply and distribution networks (both here in the UK and worldwide) may impact our ability to deliver according to our planned schedule.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nReusability and recyclability\nWe are committed to using components that can be recycled or reused, both in terms of the content of the package and the packaging materials.\nSustainable materials\nThe paper and cardboard we use comes from FSC certified forests.

Terrible things happen in Nowhereville, perpetrated both by monstrous people and literal monsters. But the townsfolk constantly forget about these things. For some reason, you remember. And you fight back. \nThe game draws inspiration from the early works of Stephen King, the X-Files, and Twin Peaks. \nIn Nowhereville, you'll endeavor to stop terrible things, defeat monsters, save lives, and foil plots. And maybe, just maybe, someday you'll get to leave. \nComplete, all-in-one rulebook for players and GMs\nCharacter creation in 5 minutes\nPlay six different archetypes with templates available for adding supernatural capabilities to your character\nGM advice and guidelines for this type of game\nA complete town with map, overview, organizations, NPCs, monsters, personal secrets, and other details\nIntensity dial to adjust how your game plays\nCharacters have four Traits (Body, Mind, Charm, and Heart), each rated 1-4. When determining whether you succeed on a task that has consequences for failure, you'll roll a number of six-sided dice equal to the rating of the Trait being used versus a target number between 4 and 6. Every time you make a Trait check, besides determining success or failure, you'll earn a point in one of three tracks (Skill, Spirit, or Sway).\nYou spend Skill to advance your character. Spirit is spent to gain in-game advantages. Sway describes the influence the town has on you, and eventually punishes you for daring to fight back. \nYour character also has access to a variety of talents, powers, and templates that you can use to customize them. \nIn addition to the game book,  you'll receive the following support materials. \n Character Playbook and Template PDFs - Form-fillable PDF character playbook for every character type in the game as well as every template available in the game\nThis Kickstarter is lean and mean. \nThe game is fully designed, playtested, and edited, and currently in layout. Artwork is finished. Your pledge will go toward reimbursing the expenses previously incurred and covering remaining expenses. \nThere are no stretch goals. There are no special backer level to create something to be added to the book later. Nothing to slow us down in getting the game to you. \nThe Kickstarter will fulfill as quickly as we can wrap up the layout and get proof copies approved. \nPDFs will be fulfilled with DriveThruRPG.com. You'll receive a download link when the game is ready. \nYou'll receive a link that will allow you purchase a copy of the physical book at-cost. You'll pay shipping then. \nThe at-cost price is just what it takes to print the book, so it's super-cheap!\nThe cost may change a bit based on final page count. The following costs are approximate. \n$3.50 USD for a softcover\n$8.00 USD for a hardcover\nShipping varies based on your location, but shipping to a US location runs around $5 USD. Go HERE to see estimates for shipping to countries outside the US. Assume a page count of around 120. \nDriveThruRPG's shipping services don't include VAT or tax for Canada, Australia, or the European Union.\nPDF download links for add-ons will be sent out a few weeks after the campaign ends, as soon as we've collected backer surveys from everyone. \n Game Design, Illustrations, and Layout: Craig Campbell (he/him) is an architect, horror fan, indie RPG designer, and the owner of NerdBurger Games.

We were like that, too \u2013 so we came up with a solution!\nThis Kickstarter funds a custom-printed shelf file designed for holding adventure modules, hardcover RPG books, and boxed sets. All four exterior panels feature new hand-painted art by Doug Kovacs!\nThe shelf file has a 3\u201d wide spine. This is thick enough to fit two big hardbacks, about 25 \u201cskinny modules,\u201d or one to two RPG boxed sets. It also fits board games that are in letter-sized dimensions. It comes with preprinted spine labels you can use to identify the contents.\nWe're offering backers of this Kickstarter a special pre-distribution price. When offered through distribution at a later date, we anticipate these costing $5 more.\nWith enough support, our stretch goals will give away extra shelf files to backers for free!\nWe're also offering a great price on a big collection of randomly selected adventure modules for your new shelf file!\nAnd backers will get to vote on the final name of the product!\nThe Sturdy Shelf File\nMade of durable corrugated cardboard, the shelf file is die-cut to shape. It ships flat, and easily folds into position. Each box is individually polybagged for safety in shipping.\nThe shelf file of holding, ready for your adventure modules!\nAmazing Art\nDoug Kovacs has hand-painted brand new art specially designed just for this project. He sketched out the image on a physical sample and painted it to fit. It will look so good, you\u2019ll want to leave this shelf file out in the open!\nSpine Labels\nEach shelf file comes with a page of labels. You can use these to easily identify what\u2019s in the box. \nStretch Goals through Economies of Scale\nWe're already level 1! That means bonus shelf files!Read this update for details! Now, help us get to 6th level!\nThe printing for this project is a classic example of economies of scale. We need to produce a die-cut mold and cover a number of up-front costs. The more we print, the faster we hurdle those fixed costs, and the lower the unit cost becomes. Stretch goals are therefore based on backers getting more copies for the same price they already pledged. \nThe basic pledge levels cover 1, 2, or 3 shelf files, and those pledge levels don\u2019t receive stretch goals. If you pledge for 4, 6, 8, or 10 shelf files, those pledge levels will begin to receive extra copies if we hit certain milestones. The end result looks kind of like a class progression table. If you've played D&D you know what we mean! It works like this:\nFor example: if the project hits 4,000 shelf files sold, everyone who pledged for 4 shelf files will actually get 5; everyone who pledged for 6 will actually get 7; and so on.\nAbove 6,000 copies, the incremental unit costs don\u2019t reduce appreciably. There are no more extra levels above there. (Unless we hit some crazy amount - never say never!)\nNote that the bonus shelf files don\u2019t \u201ccount double\u201d \u2013 only the core pledged copies count toward the stretch goal math.\n Fill It With Adventures! \nBuy your shelf file pre-filled with adventure modules at a great price! \nFor $75, you can add on a stack of 20 randomly selected adventures from our extensive line. You will save at least $125 price against cover price. There will be no duplication among the adventures, which will come from our Dungeon Crawl Classics, Mutant Crawl Classics, Fifth Edition Fantasy, Dungeon Crawl Classics Lankhmar, and other product lines.\nDepending on the mix of adventures in your random pull, you may save even more than $125. Most of our adventure modules are priced at $10, but some limited-edition variants have an MSRP of $15 or more. Those options will be included in the random pull, so depending on the mix of titles you receive, you may get an even better deal for the $75 add-on price.\nEach shelf file holds about 25 adventure modules! Stuff it full with a random pull!\nWhat To Name This Thing?\nWe asked our fans what to name this thing, and we had so many great suggestions! So many, in fact, that we could not decide.\nEvery day we will change the name of this project to a prospective name. Over the course of the project you will see two dozen possible names!\nOnce the project ends, all backers will be given a chance to vote.\nMay the best name win!\nShipping Costs\nBased on the advance prototype, we can estimate shipping costs as follows. Please note that these are estimates. Final costs will be determined at time of shipping based on weight of the physical goods. These shipping costs are for the shelf file only and do not include the pack of randomly selected adventures. That pack will add approximately $10-$15 in additional shipping cost in the USA and substantially more for international orders. International shipping costs below include prepaid VAT and shipping via a very efficient FedEx program with prefilled customs forms and quick turnaround. US shipping is estimated via priority mail.\n1 shelf file: $10-12 USA; $18-$20 international\n2-3 shelf files: $12-13 USA; $25-$30 international\n4-6 shelf files: $14-16 USA; $35-$45 international\n8-10 shelf files: $17-18 USA; $50-$80 international\nTidy up your bookshelf with the Shelf File of Holding!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nGoodman Games has run more than twenty Kickstarters, all fulfilled successfully or on track to do so.

Court of Blades takes place in the vibrant, fantasy renaissance city-state of Ilrien, in a world populated by scheming nobles, court magicians, and dashing duelists. \nAs a noble retainer, you will engage in the polite civil warfare of the great families. You will host lavish balls, and manipulate the courts, uncover the plots of your rivals, protect the city from arcane dangers, manage your own intrigues and personal scandals, leverage your reputations, connections, and so much more.\nInspired by infamous warring families like history's Medicis and Pazzis, Shakespeare's Montagues and Capulets, or Game of Thrones' Starks and Lannisters, in Court of Blades you will take on the role of a talented retainer to a newly risen House of the Esultare in the great city of Ilrien. The Esultare, composed of the six Houses Major, are considered to be the most powerful families in the Principalities. Amongst them they have their own pecking order, and every citizen of Ilrien is aware of every house\u2019s position within that order.\nYou\u2019ve already risen so high, but to secure your place and ensure that the house you serve ascends to the highest seat of power in the Principalities, you will have to learn about your rival houses, advance your house\u2019s agenda, and risk your lives in a world of duplicity and magic.\nWe play to find out if our noble retainers can play the Great Game and win it all, or if they'll fall prey to the machinations of their rivals or their own human failings.\n\nEach game session of Court of Blades centers around one errand that your coterie has chosen to prioritize accomplishing on behalf of the house you serve. You will have time to complete three of these errands in each Social Season, tied to the calendar year in Ilrien. How much of your agenda you manage to successfully complete will determine your ability to advance the house at the end of each Social Season. Beware, the higher you climb, the more rivals you will find waiting for you.\n5/17/21 Update: We had an amazing interview with Craig over at Third Floor Wars where we talked about developing Court of Blades, what a \"Court of Thrones\" expansion would look like, just how chonky this game really is and so much more!

It is a fiction-first, d6 dice pool game that is easy to play and focuses on the action, while giving you all of the tools you need to tell incredible stories with mechanical support. Responsibility for shaping the story is shared equally amongst the group, and there is very little GM prep-work to be done before each game. \nIt uses a core resolution mechanic that asks the players whether their current action is being done from a controlled, risky, or desperate position. Each situation will result in a number of different outcomes beyond mere success or failure. In Court of Blades, even a \"bad roll\" will change the landscape, affect the scene, and drive the story in interesting and satisfying directions. \nHere are some of the new toys we\u2019ve added to help you tell these stories of intrigue and peril:\n A FitD Game built for campaign-length play. While you can absolutely run a one-shot, or a single Social Season; as lovers of long-running games, Court of Blades was built to run for 30+ sessions. Plenty of time to develop deep bonds with rivals and friends, change an entire city, and maybe even find true love as you claw your way to the top.\n New and easy-to-use GM\u2019s tools that allow you to create a fully dynamic city that is filled with constantly evolving plots. With just a few dice rolls in-between each Social Season of the game, there will always be new secrets for the PCs to uncover.\n The \u201cUncover a Plot\u201d mechanic to discover what your rival houses are secretly up to. And, of course, mechanics to foil their efforts and pave the way for your house\u2019s ascension.\nWay more \u201cspecial permission\u201d abilities and items than you can shake a narrative stick at.\n New mechanics for Scandals, Bonds, Romance and Paramours, Intrigues, Influence, Warring Houses and more. \nYou can also hear us talking about some of the mechanical changes we made to the system while it was in development with the Hacked in the Dark podcast crew: Right Here!\nIn addition, we've put together a preview of the book's early release formatting that you can grab: Right Here!\n\nThe Playbooks you'll find inside.\nPlayers will each choose one of our six core Playbooks to build their retainer, ranging from the political mastermind, to the powerful magician. Or change the game with one of our two \u201cadvanced\u201d Playbooks, the Kiss and the Curse. One bound by fae blood, and the other by dark and forgotten magic.\nMultiple players can choose the same playbook, but the team gets a better range of unique abilities when everyone chooses a different playbook as their core concept. You can always reach into other playbooks to mix and match special abilities later!\nThe Bravo is a dashing sworn-sword, quick of wit and unmatched in combat. The Bravo gains xp when they address a challenge with violence or panache.\nThe Hawk is a dangerous bounty hunter, menacing and unflappable in the face of danger. The Hawk gains xp when they address a challenge with pursuit or observation.\nThe Eye is a master agent and infiltrator, cannier than a skulk of foxes and just as hard to catch. The Eye gains xp when they address a challenge with stealth or perception.\nThe Couth is a street-wise wildcard, lucky or dangerous enough to rise from the gutter. The Couth gains xp when they address a challenge with evasion or mayhem.\nThe Knack is a magical expert, gifted with arcane power and knowledge of the hidden world. The Knack gains xp when they address challenges with arcane knowledge or power.\nThe Key is a political mastermind, able to craft arguments and devices with ease. The Key gains xp when they address challenges with expertise or calculation.\nThe Kiss is a fae-touched charmer and magical manipulator. The Kiss gains xp when they address challenges with fae power or control.\nThe Curse is a haunted revenant bearing ancient knowledge, weaponry, and a grudge. The Curse gains xp when they address challenges with callous disregard or unearthly endurance.\nThe Bravo's Playbook\nThe Houses who await your service.\nPlayers decide, as a group, which of the six great houses they want their PCs to serve. Each house has its own set of strengths to explore, and its own unique flavor to inspire the sort of stories your group wants to tell. While any house can be played in whichever way the group wishes, you will find that each house lends itself naturally to a different style of play, right out of the box.\nHouse Corvetto, the \"Majestic Tyrants\" lend themselves to games of mystery, manipulation, seduction and the arcane. Serving the Corvetto, your coterie marks xp when they overcome obstacles with Coercion or Majesty.\nHouse Battalia, the \"Old House of Martial Valor\" lend themselves to games of thrilling feats of arms, protection of the city and courts, and upholding the law. In service to Battalia, your coterie marks xp when they overcome obstacles with Honor or Tradition.\nHouse Bastien, the \"Rising Tide\" lend themselves to games of charity, revolution, and looking out for the little guy against all odds. When you pledge yourselves to Bastien, your coterie marks xp when they overcome obstacles with Audacity or Unorthodoxy.\nHouse Lovell, the \"Arcane Gossipmongers of Wealth and Taste\" lend themselves to games of social intrigue, scandal, deadly rumors and arcane secrets. Under the auspices of the Lovell, your coterie marks xp when they overcome obstacles with Secrets or Discernment.\nHouse Al-Mari, the \"Tower Built of Spit and Spite\" lend themselves to games of brutal cunning, ruthlessness, and carving out your place while being beset by enemies on all sides. Pledging your sword to the Al-Mari, your coterie marks xp when they overcome obstacles with Dominance or Aggression.\nHouse Elanda, the \"Fist Around the Heart of Trade\" lend themselves to games of controlling the markets, attracting singular talent, and manipulating the city for money and power. Serving as Elanda's thumb on the scale, your coterie marks xp when they overcome obstacles with Guile or Extortion.\nHouse Lovell's Coterie Sheet\n\n$7.5k -  Court of Blades is nearly complete.

Sean Molley", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "You abandoned your old life to work in tandem with the magician: the first person to show you that true magic exists in your world. When something goes horribly wrong and the magician gets himself into a bind he can\u2019t escape, you must step forward to claim the gifts that have been yours all along, before it's too late to help him \u2014 or anyone else.\n\nThe Shape Of Shadows is a connected path game about show magic and true magic, the tension of asserting yourself as an equal to someone taking you under their wing; and the price you are willing to pay to fly on your own.\nThe Shape of Shadows can be adapted for players who prefer to write with brevity, using a bullet journal style of notation.\nThe Shape of Shadows is about a magician's assistant who, for their own reasons, dedicates their career to pursuing stage and close up magic through the mentorship of the magician. Through the eyes of the character they create, players will learn how the magician's assistant started the path they're on, how they chose to work with the magician, and why the risks and danger of learning true magic were not enough to deter them from their studies. Through intricately constructed journaling prompts, image- and word-based puzzles, and utilizing a mundane day planner to create strange alchemical rituals, players will explore the magic of the world they move through, in and out of this connected path game. The core game is played solo, but alongside everyone else who opens the door to the adventure and mystery at the heart of The Shape of Shadows. No two players' stories will be the same, but every player will walk their connected paths together through their play experiences.\n\nA sampling of letters from former assistants for the players to discover in-game.\nConnected path and keepsake games are two terms coined by Shing Yin Khor and myself during our collaboration on our previous game, Field Guide To Memory. In a connected path game, players experience unique, solitaire games while simultaneously sharing in a community of others engaging in the same creative spirit alongside them. \n\nThe joy of playing a connected path the joy of show and tell: our intuitive desire to show each other what is precious to us, why we treasure it, and why we'd like to feel compelled to share it with the communities that are precious to us in turn. \nPlaytester feedback on The Shape of Shadows was almost unanimous in its enthusiasm.\nBoth the narrative and core game experience in The Shape of Shadows center on a day planner. As the magician's assistant, much of your time in character will be spent interacting with the magician's planner, scouring it for keys to the doors he\u2019s always kept closed to you, in order to learn what you need to restore him. \nAn example of how some players answered game prompts in their planner by using color-coded index cards.\nAs the player, you will choose one month in a weekly planner to keep track of your character's increasingly strange appointments, while the rest of the planner undergoes a metamorphosis in your hands. Every day of play offers something new. Some days are contemplative, focusing on memory and observation in the form of journaling; others are adventurous and may lead you outside to find a token you need for a ritual circle; and still others involve trying your hand at more tangible crafts. \n\nWhether you're learning the nuances of different forms of sigil magic and how to work them into the trick locks you use during your close up magic shows; reviewing the finer points of talisman crafting to shield you from hecklers at the comedy club; charming your playing cards so they never tumble from your hands during a waterfall shuffle; or developing alchemical formulas for transmutation (that you can actually make in real life at home during the game!), it all goes in your planner to turn it page by page into a true magician's spellbook.\nAs far as you can tell, the magician devoted the entirety of his life to seeing how far he could push his skills in the practical application of true magic, and honing the craft of his show magic. Alchemy, cardistry, divination, illusionism, close-up, conjuring \u2014 nothing is off the table for him. \nVarious letters from former magician's assistants over the years.\nOver the course of his life the magician accumulated a veritable dragon's hoard of research materials, ritual components, flotsam and jetsam both figurative and literal (an avid beachcomber, the magician uses his findings often), and piles and piles of correspondence (some of it quite personal).\nAlmost every day during the game, you will receive 1-2(or more!) photographs and documentation of these objects as part of your gameplay prompts.\nTwo reward levels (the ILLUSIONIST and the CONJURER) include physical packages of these curiosities, mailed to you as part of the game's closing narrative.\n\n\nLOCK, $15 (UNLIMITED) \nAt the $15 KEY level, you will get added to the player list for The Shape of Shadow's live run in late summer. For the duration of the game's run you'll receive an email with story and activity prompts Monday through Thursday. The game lasts for four consecutive weeks.\n\nKEY, $25 (UNLIMITED)\nAt the $25 LOCK level, you'll get everything associated with the live game, and a high resolution PDF of the full game text, sent to you after the live run wraps up. After her superlative layout work on Field Guide To Memory, Ruby Lavin will return to design The Shape of Shadows' PDF as well.\n\nSLEIGHT, $40 (UNLIMITED)\nAt this level backers will get entry into the live game and the full game PDF for two recipients. \n\nILLUSIONIST, $60 (UNLIMITED)\nPLAY\n\nAll digital versions of the game, including the emailed live game experience in late summer, the full PDF, and large envelope of strange and beautiful paper ephemera, as described in the \"Artifacts, Art, and Ephemera\" section. Includes ephemera from the game narrative that your character or others may encounter during play, a sheet of custom-illustrated sigil stickers, and a sheet of holographic stamps showing a white rabbit popping in and out of a magician's hat. I am mountaineering up an exciting new learning curve and making this reward level unlimited.\n\nCONJURER, $350 (LIMITED TO 60 BOXES)\nAn example of what a recipient of the Conjurer's box might receive.\nIn addition to everything at the ILLUSIONIST reward level, you will receive a literal one-of-a-kind collection of beautiful flotsam and jetsam just like the talismans and treasured detritus in the magician's office. Each box is numbered, since no two boxes are exactly the same, and all of them will have at least 1-2 pieces of my original art, in different mediums.\n\nWhen I conceptualized this reward level, the thought that came to mind was \"if a cabinet of curiosities could be ordered through delivery.\" The high level of care, craftsmanship, and artistic expression I want to put into each of these boxes is the kind of experiential feast I adore creating and sharing with people; and, in order to keep it sustainable, there is a strict limit of 60 of these boxes. \n\nEach collection box will be made, packed, lovingly fussed over, and shipped out a few at a time in order to avoid bottlenecking my home studio and office. If you back at this level, please note that another backer may receive their box long before you, depending on how many people end up supporting this level.\n\nCreative Contributors\nAmal El-Mohtar is an award-winning writer of fiction, poetry, and criticism.

This game builds further on the scaffold of everything I\u2019ve learned from those experiences.\n\nThe game is fully structured and written, albeit in an unedited late-stage draft. The Kickstarter funds will cover the cost of copy editing by Ryan Boyd, and layout design by Ruby Lavin (whose previous layout credits include Field Guide To Memory and Wanderhome), as well as giving me the time I need to attend to the creative and administrative tasks associated with the multifaceted nature of connected path games like this one. Short of Mailchimp\u2019s server going down or a street magician accidentally turning me into a rabbit, I anticipate fulfillment of the text and live game to stay on schedule.\n\nI do not currently have a fulfillment partner for the Illusionist reward level (the flat art and ephemera), but I'm in touch with two or three companies and will contract the most suitable once I know what quantity of printed goods I'll need to ship. While the USPS is generally reliable for domestic US mail, with any physical reward there is always the risk of packages getting delayed or lost in thin air. \n\nAdditionally, the future of international mail sent out of the US is currently hard to read in the cards. I fully intend to work with my future fulfillment partner to send out every single package that is backed and accounted for, but be aware that it could take a very long time for your rewards to reach you. (Due to various plant pressings and organic materials in the Conjurer's boxes, I cannot ship that reward level internationally and it will be limited to US backers.)\n\nMy aim is to fulfill this Kickstarter from late July to August, well before the stated delivery dates.

The book will feature the beautiful art work of  Joel Bisaillon,  brought to you by New Comet Games, the same people who brought you the award-winning Call of Cthulhu book Devil's Swamp.\nCorsairs of Cthulhu is a rules and setting supplement to the Call of Cthulhu role-playing game and focuses on the period between 1650 and 1730 CE. Your keeper can set up your investigators as crew on a pirate or privateer ship, freelancers in one of the Caribbean ports who love the gold doubloon more than a foreign governments rule, or even provide your investigators with their own ship. Working together the investigators must face evil Mythos, real and imagined. Curses left by ancient civilizations and hidden nightmares around the world.\nThe golden age of piracy is a time of spreading empires. England, France, Spain, Italy as well as several other smaller countries are planting their flags and colonies on any piece of land they can find. Empires rise and fall, Spanish ships are hauling new found gold from the new world back to Spain and ships are lost to pirates and storms regularly. Governments authorize privateers to sail under their flag but can raise the black when needed.\n There are new skills, new professions, famous NPCs and new weapons that the investigators must learn to use if they want to survive against not only the dangers of the Mythos, but also against disease, dehydration, sea monsters, warships, and other pirates.\nCorsairs of Cthulhu is not just a setting book anticipated to be approximately 360 pages, but also contains a full campaign, The Map of the Astronomer. This campaign will take your investigators to ports unknown, fantastical lands out of this world and come face to face with some of the most dangerous Elder Gods and dark creatures ever faced. Can anything prepare the investigators for the finale and the most terrifying deity of all time.\nMany of the adventures could be run as standalone, but it is designed as a full campaign.

Written by Stoker-nominated and Audible best-selling author Arvind Ethan David, GRAY is told both as a beautiful graphic novel, with art by Eugenia Koumaki, Diana Greenhalgh and Joana Lafuente,  and as an all-star,  full-cast audiodrama. \nThis Kickstarter is to:\n#1 produce a fully dramatized, scripted audiodrama, with amazing music, sound design and an all-star cast\n#2 fund Volume 2 of the graphic novel including printing and full artwork \nThe Picture of Dorian Gray, Oscar Wilde\u2019s only novel and one of the classics of gothic literature,  is the tale of the most beautiful man of his age, who sells his soul and his conscience in exchange for eternal youth, beauty, and power \u2014 and who spends his life murdering, raping and corrupting.  All the time in his attic, his picture degrades and rots.\nGRAY flips the original's moral framework and gender archetypes: our DORIAN GRAY is a social media princess who drifts through the coolest cliques of NYC, living the most debauched of lives, breaking hearts and turning heads wherever she goes.  But Dorian has secrets.  For one thing, she\u2019s a violent criminal.  For another, she\u2019s an immortal creature of magic, hell set on a mission of revenge against some of America's most powerful men. \nWe're in the final STRETCH!\nSee all the options under \"Rewards\"!\n$100 Tier\n$150 Tier\nJagged Little STAN!\nYour own picture of Dorian... in full color! Get this 4 postcard set!\nDorian Gray - Frozen in Enamel // Dorian Gray Enamel Pin\nAdd-On Item for Physical Reward Tiers\nGray Volume 1 - Please note the final version will be hardback & not include the red \"Advanced Readers Copy\" text at the top.\nGray Volume 1 - Please note the final version will be a hardback\nGRAY remains true to Wilde\u2019s spirit of pushing every boundary, creative, sexual, and of exposing the pervasive hypocrisy of society, but we apply his lens to our era - the time of #MeToo and #DefundThePolice.  Our characters cover the spectrum of sexual and gender identity,  and like their Wildean originals, they debate, in sparkling witticisms, the most serious issues of our time. These include: Sexual Assault and the #MeToo movement; gender identity and sexual orientation and the prejudice LGTBQ+ people suffer and Systemic Racism.\nGRAY has partnered with RAINN, the nation\u2019s largest anti-sexual violence organization to provide resources to readers, listeners and our cast and company around the charged issues that the story explores. Please see the bottom of our page for more info on RAINN. \nWhilst an innocent student in the 1980s, a young woman named Dorian Gray was subjected to a ritualized assault at the hands of a cabal of ambitious men.  It was in that moment that she became something both more and less than human.  \nNow, 40 years later, but not a day older, she\u2019s ready for her revenge. To destroy the men who wronged her, but more importantly, to end once and for all the culture of sexual predators and casual abuse.  Gray believes the system can never serve women, so she's going to destroy it. \nThen Dorian meets Detective HANK WUTAN, the Black NYPD detective assigned to stop these crimes.  Hank has his own demons and his own issues with the system he's pledged to serve, but he's an incremental, cautious reformer by nature.  A rule follower. Police. \nDespite all that, and despite the fact that Dorian is his suspect number one, they fall for each other,  hard.\n\nGRAY takes Wilde\u2019s classic novel and reinvents it as a tale of cathartic revenge for the #MeToo era, a story about dangerous women and corrupt men, about sexual power and predators, about guilt and consequences and about the different ways of changing the world: those who would burn it down to start again, and those who would work from within to reform it.\n\u2026 and about how a murderous, privileged, debauched she-demon and a law-abiding Black detective can be soul mates.\nThe audio drama tells Dorian's story as a true-crime investigative podcast hosted, 20 years after the events of the book,  by the mysterious Speranza- a new character, determined for reasons of her own to figure out the truth of what happened to Dorian Gray, and to tease out the implications of her terrible crimes.  Set to release in Fall 2021.  \nThe Audiobook isn't a book on tape, it isn't an ordinary podcast, rather a fully reinvented adaptation designed solely for audio.  With an amazing cast and some of the top sound designers from the world of film and television,  we are playing with the form in the same way that Orson Welles did with War of the Worlds --  creating a fiction so convincing it's better than the truth.\nMeet our wonderful cast, which includes some of our favorite people from Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency and Jagged Little Pill :\nThe Audiobook Team\nDorian Gray's story is told in full-colour...  We're halfway there, but we need your help to tell her full story! \nThe graphic novel has been written as two volumes for release \nVolume 1 contains Chapters 1 - 5, will be released for sale on July 2021\nVolume 2 contains chapters 6 - 9 + an (epic) epilogue has been written - and with your help, it could be released October 2021!  \nGRAY - A Graphic Novel Volume 1 with cover by Aron Wiesenfeld\nGray Volume 2 - A Kickstarter Exclusive, with cover by Eugenia Koumaki!\nPlease see our shipping chart below.

Sean Molley", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Blue Planet is a compelling RPG journey into humanity\u2019s precarious future on a distant waterworld where political unrest and a hungry alien ecology threaten the nascent colony effort. A planet where GEO marshals struggle to maintain peace, Incorporate mercenaries wage amphibious proxy wars, and native insurgents fight for their adopted world. A frontier where human desperation and corporate greed ravage an uncanny ecology, threatening to plunge humanity into a war of survival with an ancient, alien legacy. \nThough the original Blue Planet predates many of these titles, the setting is evoked by the movies Avatar, Blade Runner and Outland, the television series The Expanse, Firefly and Earth II and the books Legacy of Heorot, Songs of Distant Earth and the Mars Trilogy. A reviewer once gave a glib but accurate elevator pitch for Blue Planet as \"Space marshal Cowboy and his cybernetic dolphin sidekick fight eco-crimes in alien Hawaii.\" \nDiptych Book Covers\nThe Full Premise \nBlue Planet's uniqueness and enduring appeal are in its deep, realistic, hard science fiction setting, and to really describe it requires more than a few sentences. For those new to the waterworld, we recommend exploring the more detailed premise here.\nThis campaign will fund the production of a new third edition of the critically acclaimed Blue Planet roleplaying game. We\u2019ve brought Blue Planet to Kickstarter because we're excited to make the definitive edition of the game, but we need your help to do that.\nWe want to design a uniquely beautiful, full-color, two-volume, 600-page masterpiece, overflowing with evocative art, captivating text, and exceptional production values. We want to make the books themselves works of art with UV cover highlights, endpaper maps and page-marking ribbons. We want to fill them with a new rules set, stunning art, expansive color maps and compelling new locations, social structures, future technologies and alien secrets.\nThese features and content exceed our capacity to resource on our own, so we are here asking you to join the Blue Planet team and help us make the new version of this classic game truly exceptional. \nPlayer's and Moderator's Guides - 300 pages each\nDownload the Blue Planet: Recontact Quickstart Guide here. This 80+ page, full color primer is free and contains the new version of the rules, a setting sampler and a demo scenario called \"Trouble in Paradise,\" complete with ready-to-play characters.\nDraft Layout\nThe Recontact project includes\n\u2022 An extensive evolution of the core mechanics, taking advantage of two decades of RPG development. The new system can be found here in our free, 80+ page Recontact primer.\n\u2022 All new, full-color artwork bringing the waterworld to life in stunning, evocative imagery.\n\u2022 Full-color world and regional maps, including submarine geography, redesigned and rendered by professional cartographer and game designer Mark Richardson (Green Hat Design).\n\u2022 A series of campaign archetypes to help moderators jumpstart their games in the vast adventure space of Poseidon (see below).\n\u2022 Updated speculative technologies.\n\u2022 New sociopolitical systems, organizations, institutions and conflicts.\n\u2022 New locations, settlements and facilities.\nSample of the Newly Rendered Maps\nThe Recontact project does not include\n\u2022 Fundamental changes to the core sociopolitical tensions - the themes will remain staunchly pro-environmental and anti-colonial. \n\u2022 Timeline advancements - the setting was originally - and intentionally - poised on a sociopolitical precipice, rife with plot and storytelling potential, and we want to maintain that same narrative tension.\n\u2022 Global rewrites of the setting material - though updates, sensitivity edits and additions are being made throughout, we believe Blue Planet\u2019s deep setting is why the game has endured, and so we are not making major alterations to that essential content.\nA word about the delivery date\nWe know a reward delivery date of October 2022 seems unexpectedly far away. Though we intend to deliver Blue Planet sooner, our experience, and the last year in particular, have proven an essential truth about Kickstarter management - set a generous delivery date, then add six months. We hope this date does not discourage folks from becoming backers, but instead demonstrates our commitment to realistic planning and transparent communication. \nAll reward tiers (digital and physical) will receive PDFs of the out-of-print Blue Planet books the day after the campaign ends. Single book pledges will receive the corresponding v2 PDF, and book set pledges will receive copies of everything ever published for the line. All 10 past Blue Planet titles - over 1700 pages of waterworld adventure - as immediate rewards!\nFirst edition Blue Planet, Archipelago, Access Denied, v2 Blue Planet Player's and Moderator's Guides, Fluid Mechanics, First Colony, Frontier Justice, Natural Selection and Ancient Echoes.\nArchipelago - 1st ed. Gazetteer\nBlue Planet has received broad acclaim, particularly for its deep, detailed, and realistic setting, and has remained well regarded since its original publication. However, that publication was almost 25 years ago, and in the intervening decades, all versions have gone out of print and game design has evolved dramatically. We are therefore excited at the prospect of giving the game system an overdue overhaul and the opportunity to share Blue Planet with a new generation of players.  \nInterior Art Sample - Native Pod Passing Dyfed\nMore personally, Blue Planet features critical environmental themes, presenting a precarious future threatened by the dire consequences of ecological collapse. If issues like biodiversity loss, ocean acidification and climate change were only obscure concerns within the scientific community 25 years ago, they are now clear and present existential threats to the human species. This new edition will let us add our own small voice to those demanding true stewardship of our original blue planet.\nCompelled by these reasons, the original creators at Biohazard Games have teamed up with publisher Gallant Knight Games to produce a modern edition of this classic RPG. \nInterior Art Sample - Moon Pool Intrusion\nRecontact is the in-game term for the fateful day in 2165 when the UNSS Admiral Robert Perry entered orbit around Poseidon, \u201creestablishing contact\u201d with Earth 69 years after the original colonists were abandoned. Given that more than two decades have passed since the publication of the first edition of Blue Planet, RECONTACT seemed a fitting subtitle for this new version of the game.\nAnyone familiar with Blue Planet v2\u2019s Synergy rules will recognize the new system as a modern evolution of those mechanics, sharing a little of that design's genetics and the same intent to support the hard science realism of the setting. Players will also find the new system is simultaneously simpler and more robust, while supporting richer, more evocative character creation that's focused as much on who characters are as what characters can do. \nDraft Character Sheets\nCharacters have 4 attributes with optional foci and up to 8 skill sets - areas of expertise based on player-generated descriptors that evoke a character\u2019s origins, training, occupation and experiences. The core mechanic is roll \u2264 (attribute rank)+(skill set rank). The roll is made with either 1, 2 or 3 d10, depending upon whether the general, core or specialty in a given skill set is being used. For those who know v2, these elements should seem familiar. There are fewer attributes, but they work similarly, and the variable dice pool is a streamlined take on the aptitude mechanic. The skill sets are simultaneously simpler and more robust than the long list of specific aptitudes and skills in the 2nd edition. \nBlue Planet does remain a realistically dangerous game, keeping the  wound levels and trauma tests from the 2nd edition. Weapons and sea monsters are therefore quite deadly, so characters should try to avoid getting shot. Or eaten.\nInterior Art Sample - Work in Progress 1 - Greater White Attack\nInterior Art Sample - Work in Progress 2 - Greater White Attack\nInterior Art Sample - Final Image - Greater White Attack\nThe new mechanics also lean in to the qualitative roleplaying aspects of modern character design, providing Tags, Tracks and Ties unique to each player's character concept and each moderator's campaign. The emphasis is as much on who a character is as what they can do. \nTags are specific consequences, benefits, convictions, motivations or other active descriptors that a character incurs during their adventures - generally the result of narrative events, important tests, fallout from interactions with other characters and injuries.\nTracks model the range of specific character emotions, attitudes and mental states. They are usually campaign or party specific and can be offered by the moderator or created by the players for their party or their individual characters.\nTies describe a character\u2019s primary relationships, identifying the people and organizations to whom the character is connected, as well as the nature of the obligations they must meet to maintain those relationships.\nThe only consistent criticism Blue Planet has received over the years is that the setting is so vast and wide open, it\u2019s often challenging for game moderators to know where to start. They struggle to choose a single campaign current from among the sea of ideas in the setting. Blue Planet: Recontact will therefore provide a diverse set of campaign archetypes to provide ready-made options for GMs new to the game.\nIt\u2019s common practice for RPG books to present a range of character archetypes, providing players with detailed examples of the kinds of PCs available to play. These campaign archetypes are similar providing GMs with starting points, directions and enough details to get a variety of different campaigns underway. Each archetype outlines a premise, PC suggestions, unique NPCs, key locations, resources, themes, and plot threads from which a GM can build their perfect Blue Planet campaign.\nSample Campaign Archetype\nRead the full first example - Red Sky Charters - in the Recontact Primer here. \nThe project has a list of exciting stretch goals to further enhance the game with additional setting content, player support, scientific resources and even a potential glimpse through another wormhole. \n$32,500 - Guest Author Campaign Archetypes: Three additional campaign hooks created by luminaries in the RPG industry, offering new and creative directions to take your Blue Planet adventures. \nElizabeth Chaipraditkul\nGraeme Barber\nMari Murdock\nThese bonus archetypes will be added to those already planned for the Moderator's Guide. \n$35,000 - More Maps: We will commission two additional maps from the amazing Mark Richardson. As we reach higher funding levels,  we'll add even more maps to his production list. \n$37,500 - PC Species Trio: A collection of three new player character species will be added to the Player's Guide.\n\"Skink\"  - a third-generation, herptile-based hybrid genie with unique senses, enhanced durability and rapid healing. This species was developed on Mars and subsequently recruited in surprising numbers to Poseidon as Incorporate colonists. \n\"Xeno\" - a rare individual who has had the full rejuvenating and longevity benefits of Xenosilicate therapy since its inception - a member of a generation of newly immortal Incorporate elites whose privilege and resources are quickly outstripping the rest of humanity's.\nSperm Whale - the cloned and artificially gestated, uplifted members of a cohort of two dozen sperm whales released on Poseidon by an egomaniacal oligarch obsessed with cetacean sapience. (Yeah, this one will be a role playing challenge, for sure!)\n$40,000 - Station Trio: Gazetteer entries for three new, high-tech, high-pressure adventure locations will be added into the Moderator's Guide.\nDown Home Station - the GEO's state-of-the-art underwater research city - the high water mark of the Organization's influence on Poseidon.  Down Home is a place of shining science, high technology, cutthroat competition and dangerous secrets.  \nLesear High Orbital - the sprawling space platform that serves as one of Poseidon's primary orbital dockyards, transit hubs and spacer habitats. The station is a zero-g facility where trade, politics and greed fuse together behind pressurized bulkheads while its elite and powerful occupants look down on the ocean world below. \nProteus Landing - the Incorporate research cooperative on the water planet's oversized, biome-supporting moon. Research, rivalries and relationships create ever-changing, always challenging sources of adventure on this isolated outpost. \n$42,500 - Increased Art Commission: At this funding level, we will commission an additional ten pieces of interior art for the project. As we continue to raise funds past this level, our goal is to work towards a fully illustrated field guide.\n$45,000 - UV Spot Gloss Cover & Ribbon Bookmark: At this funding level, we'll add  ribbon bookmarks to each offset printed book, as well as enhance the cover with UV spot gloss to make Jeff Zugale's fantastic cover art jump right off the page. \n$47,500 - Increased Art Commission: At this funding level, we will commission an additional ten pieces of interior art for the project. As we continue to raise funds past this level, our goal is to work towards a fully illustrated field guide.\n$50,000 - Slipcase: A beautiful, two-book slipcase, intended to embossed with the submarine topography of the Pacifica Archipelago. The final slipcase might vary or change based on production needs, but we'll make it as nice as we can! All two-book sets ($100 pledge level or higher) will receive this upgrade as part of the pledge.\nInterior Art Sample - Amphibious Recon\n$52,500 - GEO Commission and Incorporate Logo Designs: Rendered logos lending each significant Colonial Commission and Incorporate nation unique visual identity and style. These will be incorporated throughout the books.\n$55,000 - The Outback: An all-new, full gazetteer section for the little explored and even less inhabited \"backside\" hemisphere of Poseidon. Includes a new map commission, regional descriptions, outposts and Most Wanted NPCs. \n$57,500 - Wormhole: A 10k-word expos\u00e9 outlining the secrets of the...REDACTED...and their ancient...REDACTED... This is a setting-changing resource for moderators who want to take their players on the ultimate Blue Planet adventure. \n$60,000 - Scientific Archive: We will curate an online library of speculative technology and essential oceanographic, marine biology and xenobiological resources that will provide verisimilitude for adventures on the water world and environmental education for players and moderators alike. This living resource will be a webpage accessible to all backers. \n$62,500 - Increased Art Commission: At this funding level, we will commission an additional ten pieces of interior art for the project. As we continue to raise funds past this level, our goal is to fully illustrate the \"Poseidon Field Guide.\"\n$65,000 - Web Apps: We will commission a web app developer to build two Blue Planet: Recontact themed in-game apps for use in play. \nPoseidon/Earth Date Synchronizer - a quick conversion calculator that matches Earth normal with Poseidon normal dates. \nIncorporate Script Exchange Rate Tracker - an exchange rate generator that tracks and displays the daily variations and exchange rates between the relative values of the major Incorporate script. \nWe never expected to get this far, and so never thought we would get to share these, but we are excited to offer even more stretch goal enhancements and additions to the project. \n$67,500 - GM Screen Inserts: At this funding level, we will provide inserts for customizable game screens. They will feature at least one custom landscape image on the front panels and a collection of essential moderator information on the back panels. The inserts will be sized to fit the Hammerdog GM Screen offered by DTRPG and provided in both portrait and landscape formats. Backers will be given a POD code for at-cost purchase through DTRPG, but will be responsible for all shipping and at-cost printing fees. Backers will also be provided files that will allow them to print their own inserts or have them commercially produced at their local print shop.\n$70,000 - Map Card Player Handouts: At this level, we will convert the maps created for the game into US letter-sized, card stock player handouts. The collection will also include additional four-panel sets that can be assembled into larger versions of the major world maps and laid out on the table top to accessorize play. Backers will be given a POD code for at-cost purchase through DTRPG, but will be responsible for all shipping and at-cost printing fees. Backers will also be provided files that will allow them to print their own map panels or have them commercially produced at their local print shop.\n$75,000 - Hardware Spot Illustrations: This funding level will allow us to produce twice the number of spot illustrations for the equipment chapter of the project. Twice the vehicles, robots, remotes, biomods and weapons!\n$77,500 - Settlement Maps: At this level, we will commission detailed settlement maps for the colonial capital of Haven, Lavender Organics\u2019 famous floating city of Dyfed, and the GEO\u2019s grand scientific and social experiment, Down Home Station.\n$80,000 - World of Hurt: This funding level will allow us to produce a 10k-word overview of life on Earth, detailing the unrecognizable, post-Blight political landscape and the economic stranglehold of the Incorporate nations. It will address the rising and increasingly violent unrest of the Earth's population and lean into the legacy of environmental destruction and rampant capitalism that has left the planet on the brink of social and ecological collapse. This reward will be offered in PDF format only.\n$85,000 - Fully Illustrated Field Guide: If we reach this goal, we will commit to fully illustrating the Poseidon field guide entries - more than 60 spot illustrations featuring the often frightening, sometimes bizarre, frequently majestic, but always fascinating creatures of Poseidon\u2019s alien ecology.\n$90,000 - Storm Surge Adventure Trio: At this funding level, we will produce a three-scenario set, suitable for use as standalone adventures or as an interconnected campaign. The scenarios will trace the rising tide of conflict between the Incorporate city states and the native insurgency and follow the seemingly vain efforts of the GEO to keep peace on the waterworld. The players can be of any or related factions, and depending upon their interests, moderators can lead the story directly into the secrets of Wormhole. This reward will be offered in PDF format only.\n$100,000 - Wormhole Bonus Content and Print-on-Demand: At this funding level, we'll double the size of Wormhole to 20k words and produce a POD version of the book. After all, even these extra pages will not be enough to contain all the secrets we want to share. Backers will get a POD code for at-cost purchase though DTRPG, but will be responsible for all shipping and at-cost printing fees. Please note that production logistics mean this book may be delivered after the primary rewards of the campaign.\nWith 22 stretch goals already funded and the end of the campaign in sight, we want to offer a final wave of cool additions to the project.\n$107,000 - Virtual Table Top Assets: Funding this goal will provide a collection of Blue Planet: Recontact resources (maps, counters, artwork) in generic formats that can be downloaded from DriveThruRPG and used on most online, RPG virtual play platforms. We will also produce a number of platform-specific, automated character sheets - the given platforms will depend on development costs. \n$114,000 - Travel Time and Weather Apps: This level will add two additional, in-game apps to compliment the date and exchange rate calculator stretch goal. The first will provide inter-settlement distances with travel times, and the second will provide daily weather forecasts by planetary region.\n$120,000 - World of Hurt Bonus Content and Print-on-Demand: At this funding level, we'll double the size of World of Hurt to 20k words and produce a POD version of the book. There are too many tales of trial and triumph to be told on Earth in 2199 not to give you more room to play there. Backers will be given a POD code for at-cost purchase though DTRPG, but will be responsible for all shipping and at-cost printing fees. Please note that production logistics mean this book may be delivered after the primary rewards of the campaign.\nAbove $120,000: Any funds raised beyond this level will go toward improving the quality of the core books and previously unlocked stretch goals with more illustrations, maps, freelance assignments and production upgrades. We are intentionally ending itemized stretch goals here so that we do not risk \u201cmission creep\u201d and overload production. We are dedicated to keeping the scope manageable and the project moving forward. This campaign has been a wonderful and surprising success, and we want to be certain we deliver as promised.

This includes tracking delivered to your email.\nFor pledges that include more than books (items such as dice, cards or tokens), we have to increase the cost to $15 (priority mail + packaging and handling costs).\nWe always do our best to keep shipping affordable by doing our own fulfillment so we can ensure it's done right.\nEU Shipping\nFor orders in the EU, our friends at Angry Hamster Publishing are handling our Kickstarter fulfillment.\nFor book-only pledges, we charge a flat \u20ac10 shipping charge (the shipping costs + packaging and handling costs) for EU addresses. We're still exploring tracking options and will share those details when we have them. \nFor pledges that include more than books (items such as dice, cards or tokens), we have to increase the cost to \u20ac25 (a larger package + packaging and handling costs). These packages are tracked.\nBecause these packages will be shipping from inside the EU, VAT and Customs fees will not apply!\nUK Shipping\nFor book-only pledges, we use Royal Mail, which is relatively inexpensive. Unfortunately, we can't currently offer a firm price as rate increases are imminent in the UK.\nFor pledges that include more than books (items such as dice, cards or tokens), unfortunately, we can't give a firm price as rate increases are imminent in the UK. We will use the Parcelforce service.\nOur fulfillment team will updated numbers soon, and we'll post those ASAP.\nThe Rest of the World\nWe recommend you look into the options below for print-on-demand. If you still want an offset book, you're welcome to back at the appropriate level, but you will be charged full shipping, and we will be unable to offer refunds of your pledge if shipping ends up more than you expected. It can get very expensive - effectively doubling the cost of your pledge - so please be aware before you pledge. \nIf you need an estimate, don't hesitate to reach out to shipping@gallantknightgames.com\nIf You're Concerned About Shipping Costs...\nWe are exploring having the Blue Planet: Recontact books in print on demand on DriveThruRPG. We fully intend to offer POD options if we can do so appropriately.

They are skilled creators, capable production managers and experienced industry professionals. Though this is only Biohazard's second Kickstarter, Gallant Knight Games and its principal Alan Bahr have brought over 20 Kickstarter campaigns to completion under the GKG banner, as well as helped to deliver other projects (including troubled or disrupted ones) and understands how to execute on funded projects. There is always the possibility of unforeseen events delaying production, but Blue Planet is as sure an RPG investment as Kickstarter has to offer.\n\nQ: Can Biohazard/Gallant Knight Games handle this project?\nGallant Knight Games has run over 20 projects (even more as a consultant) and worked with Biohazard before, so we're bringing a wealth of experience to the table. We're aiming for an ambitious project, something big and exciting here, so while there will inevitably be hiccups, we're equipped to manage them.\n\nQ: What if the text or art isn't finished?\nA: 85% of the text is done and the rest is outlined. Artists have been contracted, and we've already invested considerable money into the project and will see it to the end.\n\nQ: What about delays in art?\nA: We've already begun the process of commissioning the core art assets for the game, and we're really pleased with the work so far. If there are issues or delay on the art, we also have back-up artists who are ready work.\n\nQ: Increase in shipping costs?\nA: Shipping costs constantly rise, and while we've projected them to the best of our abilities, there's not a lot we can do if they change. However, due to the limitations on the size of our product, we're confident this won't be a critical issue. We're working to ensure we can provide worldwide shipping to everyone as economically as possible. \n\nWe have teamed up with Angry Hamster Games to handle our EU and varied world-wide fulfillment. In the UK, Red Dice Games will be handling the Blue Planet: Recontact fulfillment.\n\nQ: What if something happens to the principals?\nA: If something were to happen to Jeff or another writer on the project, we've identified our backups, and our team is spread all over the world. It'd take a really big asteroid, zombie apocalypse or alien invasion to wipe us all out. The files and plans have been communicated to the whole team, and a new project lead has already been identified.\n\n*IMPORTANT NOTE*\nWe hold rewards for a year from fulfillment start date, after which we can no longer promise that we'll be able to fulfill your rewards. We're a small company with limited space, and while we've never had an issue, it's better to be clear about our practices so you're aware. Once we start shipping, if your reward gets returned, or your fulfillment info wasn't provided, we'll give you a full calendar year to sort out the issues and will still ship your rewards. After a year, we may no longer have the rewards, or we might require you to pay updated shipping charges, as they are always going up.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 18 or more", "title": "Digital Player's Guide", "descp": "\u2022 PDF copy of the new Recontact: Player's Guide.\n\u2022 PDF copy of the 2nd edition Blue Planet Player's Guide the day after the campaign ends.\nThe Player's Guide contains the introductory setting material, speculative technology and complete game rules.\nINCLUDES:\nBlue Planet: Recontact Player's Guide PDF\nPDF version of the 2nd edition Blue Planet Player's Guide\nAll applicable, funded, digital stretch goals", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2022"}], "stat": ["14 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 18 or more", "title": "Digital Moderator's Guide", "descp": "\u2022 PDF copy of the new Recontact: Moderator's Guide.\n\u2022 PDF copy of the 2nd edition Blue Planet Moderator's Guide the day after the campaign ends.\nThe Moderator's Guide is a deep dive into the Blue Planet setting, covering the numerous factions, regional gazetteer, ecology and lethal wildlife.

After the success of Fantasy City Sites and Scenes (Kickstarter campaign, DrivethruRPG page) and Fantasy City Sites and Scenes II (Kickstarter campaign, DrivethruRPG page), I'm back with a third volume in the series and another sixteen city locations for your campaign. \nFantasy City Sites and Scenes III is a 48-page (plus cover, inside covers, and back cover) 8.5\" x 11\" book for gamemasters who are in need of inspiration. This systemless work builds on those two earlier books in the line, but gamemasters may ignore the earlier titles if they wish and use only the locations detailed within this book.\n City Sites. The sixteen locations described in the book (each a two-page spread) presents new buildings that may be dropped into your campaign . . . and along with it, the characters and events detailed alongside the building. You won't find a dry collection of statistics and facts in this book. Each entry was written to spark the gamemaster's imagination and provide GMs with just enough to take the idea and make it their own!\n City Scenes. Pages 36 through 48 (plus the inside back cover of the printed book!) are packed with new encounters. These encounters do not duplicate any found in the first two Fantasy City Sites and Scenes books, meaning that this section greatly expands the gamemaster's number of choices when it comes time to randomly select a city encounter.\nDigital mockup. Text shown on the pages is not complete.\nDo you already own my other fantasy RPG supplements that were created thanks to the support of Kickstarter backers? Then you're looking for either the $1 (PDF) or $18 (print, U.S. only) reward levels. \nAre you outside of the United States and want print-on-demand codes? Please see below. \nFantasy City Sites and Scenes III is available in three different editions:\nPDF - For only a buck! If this campaign is successful, you will be able to download the systemless 48-page book in PDF from Dropbox. \nPrint Code - The $10 and $30 rewards include both the Dropbox link to download the book in PDF and a coupon code to purchase the printed edition from DrivethruRPG as a full-color softcover book. You will be responsible for the printing and shipping costs. (See the FAQ for more information.) ESTIMATED DRIVETHRURPG PRINT PRICE: $8 per softcover book. Please note that you pay all printing and shipping costs at DrivethruRPG as a separate expense.\nSaddle-Stitched Book. United States only. The $18 and $58 rewards is for a saddle-stitched edition that will be printed at Mixam, the same printer I worked with for the first two volumes in this series. If you already own the two earlier titles as saddle-stitched works, the $18 reward is what you want. \nThe print-on-demand offering is primarily for those who live outside of the United States and want a copy of the book in print.\nNOTE: The print-on-demand book will be created using DrivethruRPG's print-on-demand systems and will be offered using the best quality paper they offer. Your Kickstarter pledge for the print code does not cover the actual printing and shipping costs; those will be your responsibility.  (See the FAQ for more information.)\nAll DrivethruRPG price estimates are estimates only and effective as of project launch. I do not have any control over the DrivethruRPG systems and any price changes and shipping costs are under their control. All I can provide are estimates. Final prices may vary.\nSo that we don't accidentally cause project delays, there will be no stretch goals for this campaign. I'd much rather deliver on schedule than risk running late with delivery of the rewards.\nI know that the lack of stretch goals will cause some of you to turn away, but I ask that you keep this in mind: The 52-page PDF reward is only a buck, making this a great deal for any gamemaster who enjoys running city encounters and adventures.\nAs you can see in the reward levels, I have estimated delivery as December 2021. Why so long? Unlike the first two books in the series, I have not yet written this third volume. I'll start the work just as soon as possible if we meet the funding goal, and I'll do all I can to finish well before December, but I want to give myself plenty of time in case things go wrong.\nAs with all of my projects, I'll post regular updates so everyone knows where I'm at with the creative process of the book.\n\nDid you miss the Fantasy City Sites and Scenes and Fantasy City Sites and Scenes II Kickstarter campaigns?

The darkness grew shape, and focus, and form before regarding them with glowing eyes filled with promise and pain, a hint of chaos and a dash of admiration.  \n\nIt spoke to them, \"From the time you were born your eyes were open to the light within the darkness, your ears heard the whispers within the silence.  In slumber you saw the dreams behind what most would call nightmares. It called out to us, and we called back. Now we are here together. You have done well, coming this far on your own, but the time has come for you to journey further down this path. Be warned, this is not an easy path, nor a safe one, and it is journey which never ends.  But if you truly wish to walk it, we will show you the way, as other shapes and shadows did for us, when we sat where you are now. So, are you ready?\"\n\nThe six, a newly formed coven, spoke as one. \"Yes, my master. We are ready.\"\n\nThe darkness smiled, \"Then let us begin.\"\n\nWelcome to Terror of Octobernomicon.\nTerror of Octobernomicon\nThis project is a celebration of new authors, writing about new monsters, in brand new scenarios shepherded along by a pair of established industry mentors.  The new authors are young, eager, and talented fresh faces, making their mark on the internet, though the Miskatonic Repository, seeking out mentors for their craft, or challenging them on the field of battle.  They have shown their worth.  They have earned their place, and their time has come.\n\nFor mentors we have:\n Matt \"Trollboy\" Wiseman - Ennie award winning author and webmaster of Shoggoth.net\n Oscar Rios - Ennie award winning author, publisher, and president of Golden Goblin Press.\nWe can't begin to express how excited we are to be part of these new author's journey, and to present these exciting new scenarios and authors to both our fans and the wider Call of Cthulhu Role Playing community.\n\nWhat is Octobernomicon?\nThe new monsters come from the pages of Shoggoth.net's most beloved traditions - Octobernomicon.  Year after year this amazing online community features 31 original monsters for the Call of Cthulhu Role Playing Game, one for each day of October. These creatures are submitted by talented amateurs and established professionals alike, posted daily, free to download and incorporate into Keeper's home campaigns. Octobernomicon has always been a place for new authors to cut their teeth, fertile ground for eager young creators wishing to add their voices to the dark chorus of Call of Cthulhu. \n\nThe Collection\nTerrors of Octobernomicon will be a collection of six original scenarios, written by six new and newish authors, each featuring an original monster from Octobernomicon. Four of the scenarios are classic 1920's-30's era adventures, one is for the Cthulhu Invictus\u2122 setting (The Roman Empire), and another is for the Down Darker Trails\u00ae setting (The Old West).  Each has been edited by the teams mentors, with professional maps, illustrations, and handouts by our design teams (Mike Wilson - Editing, Greg Shipp - Cartography, Brad Hicks - Cover & Interior illustrations, Alberto Guerra - Interior Illustrations, Mark Shireman - Layout & Design), a mix of Golden Goblin Press and Shoggoth.net personnel. \n\n Classic Era (1920\u2019s-30's) \n Suspended Pending Resolution, by Francesca McMahon \nThings just don't seem to add up...\nInvestigators are hired by an insurance company handling the salvage of a wrecked freighter, beached along the coast of Cornwall, near St. Ives, in Great Britain. It seems salvage crews have turned up a number of alarming discrepancies, and certain questions about the tragic events of five years ago have never been fully explained. Work has been halted after a number of unexplained events begin plaguing the worksite. Soon investigators stumble upon the smoldering embers of a deeper, and far deadlier, mystery.\n\n Accounts of Violence, by Marek Golonka \nA lovely morning in Vienna ruined by madness and mystery.\nWhen relaxing in a Vienna Caf\u00e9, investigators are victims of an unprovoked attack by a local journalist. They are shocked to discover he knows some of their names and a bit about them. Looking into a possible connection between the unhinged man and themselves leads investigators to a most unusual mystery. Soon other attacks follow, as random acts of violence spreads through the City of Dreams. Will investigators be able to put a stop to it all before it\u2019s too late?\n\n Scarabs of Sekhmet, by Helen Yau \nWelcome to the trip of a lifetime, because it might just be your last.\nAfter winning tickets on the maiden voyage of Reine du Nil, their picturesque riverboat cruise down the Nile takes a terrifying turn. Deck side cocktails are quickly sidelined as rumors of grave robbers, mystical curses, and ancient folklore ensnare everyone in a web of death, horror, and madness. For everyone onboard the fine line between life and death soon thins and becomes blurred. Can investigators solve the mystery in time to not only save themselves, but everyone else onboard as well?\n\n Currency of Grief, by Daniel Purcell  \nDark things lurk in the spaces between love, grief, and madness.\nA wealthy family hires the investigators to find the widow of their dead son, who vanished after quickly draining the substantial inheritance he left to provide for her. Their suspicion falls squarely on a \u201cso-called spirit medium\u201d, a charlatan they claimed was preying upon her deep grief. They soon learn she is not his only victim, but also discover a darker truth; that grief has a value all its own, one coveted by creatures beyond human understanding.\n\nSun and Shadow, by Walter Attridge\nInvestigators find themselves in North Queensland, Australia, delivering an exotic cargo to the owner of a major sugar plantation. The cargo of Cane Toads (the world\u2019s largest toad, native to South and Central America) could revolutionize pest control on his crops and increase his profit margins considerably. But his Aboriginal workers are deeply opposed to the plan, claiming that the interlopers would anger their gods. Things quickly spiral out of control when workers walk off the job and people begin to vanish. Can the investigators solve the mystery before it\u2019s too late?\n\n Cthulhu Invictus (Ancient Rome)\n The Expedition, by Morgan Llewellyn \nZosimos, are you sure you packed quite enough maps??\nThe investigators are hired to guards an expedition into the Arabian wilderness. Their employer seeks a newly discovered oasis rumored to contain a grove of wild Torchwood trees. As these trees are the source of both Frankincense and Myrrh, rare commodities worth more than their weight in gold, he is sure that untold riches are there for the taking. However, unbeknownst to anyone, this oasis has a dark and secret history, and the grove is far from undefended.\n\n Down Darker Trails (The Old West)\n A Lowdown Dirty Owlhoot, by William Adcock \nWhat manner of low down dirty owlhoot would go and hang a woman?\n The Colorado Territory is a good place for all sorts of bad people to vanish into. The investigators are hired by the good people of Milkweed City to hunt down a mysterious creature rumored to be responsible to for a string of deaths. Said to fly about at night and kill at will, the local papers call it \u201cThe Devil Buzzard.\u201d When investigators find a hanged woman, lefts for dead, with a story to tell, well, things get plumb loco.\n\n\nAbout Our Authors\nGolden Goblin Press and Shoggoth.net have pooled their contact lists, scoured the internet, and peaked behind every keeper screen in every convention across the universe, in a search for the best, brightest, and most creative new authors we could fine.

Note that the Ant-Man and Wasp Stretch Goals can only be found in the standard retail Core Box.\nWe will be offering backers the option to choose 2-Wave Expedited Shipping for their pledges! By selecting this option, we will separate your pledge into two shipping Waves. The First Wave will contain only the Marvel United: X-Men Core Box (however many copies you get) and it is estimated to deliver around September 2021, about the same time as the Core Box goes to retail. Then, the Second Wave will contain everything else in your pledge, including the box of Stretch Goals and all Optional Buys, and it is estimated to deliver around May 2022. Of course, by separating the shipping, the total cost of 2 different shipments will be charged, so by selecting this option you should notice an increase in your shipping cost and VAT if applicable. The finals costs will be calculated on the Pledg.it Pledge Manager system, however estimates for both waves are listed under 'Shipping Information'. Backers who select Single Wave Shipping will get their full pledge in the estimated May 2022 delivery date.\nPlease take note that once the system launches they'll also have different deadlines to confirm the pledges, with the Expedited shipment having a much earlier deadline. After the deadline to confirm the Expedited shipment pledges, all pledges (and extra pledges) containing the First Wave Core Box will be locked and will no longer be editable. However, everything related to the Second Wave will be editable up until the Second Wave deadline. This means that backers that confirm a 2-Wave Expedited Shipping order will still be able to add/remove pledges/add-ons related to the Second Wave after the First Wave deadline.\nNote: 2-Wave Expedited Shipping will not be available to backers in the UK.\nBased on past experience, we will be charging shipping after the Kickstarter concludes, based on the actual costs incurred to ship. We will collect this via our Pledg.it pledge manager after the campaign ends, using PayPal or Stripe. This is so we can be fair to all our backers as shipping is rarely one size fits all, and also give you more promo goodies and possibly a choice of carrier options.\nDepending on where in the world you are, we will either ship to you from our hub in the EU (European backers), UK (UK backers), Asia (Asian backers), Canada (Canadian backers), Australia (Australia and New Zealand backers) or Atlanta (USA and the rest of the world). Following is a list of rough estimates for shipping a basic Mutant pledge, for a 1 or 2-wave shipment. Keep in mind these are just estimates and that accurate costs will be calculated in the pledge manager system according to your address and that costs will likely rise based on optional buys you choose.\n>>> Note that, in compliance to the EU and UK laws, VAT will also be charged on the pledge manager system for EU and UK backers. At this time we cannot estimate the cost as the charges vary from country to country and it is based on the price of the order plus the actual shipping costs (which can only be properly determined in the system). However, rest assured that the full VAT to be charged on each pledge will be clearly displayed in the pledge manager system before final confirmation. European countries that are not part of the European Union or UK will not be charged VAT.\n**Latin America, Africa, and ROW estimates are based on USPS rates. If USPS is not available, these rates may change. \nBe aware that any pledges that are confirmed after the pledge manager deadline is considered a \"Late Confirm\" and will be shipped from the Asia Hub at a later date, likely incurring increased shipping costs and possible customs fees. Also, note that Late Confirms will not be able to customize the contents of their pledge. They will be offered a single pledge, including most, if not all, the content offered on Kickstarter. We also cannot ship to PO Boxes domestically or internationally. Due to the size of each package there is too great a risk of the package being bounced back to us.\nThe table below gives you a general idea of the full schedule of what to expect once the campaign ends. Keep in mind these are just estimates, and the timeline may vary due to circumstances.\n To learn about Retail Pledges click HERE.\n                                                          \u00a9 2021 MARVEL", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our 48th Kickstarter, and there are some vagaries in terms of timing when it comes to anything produced in China, such as:\nProduction delays\nShipping delays\nCustoms delays\n\nThe estimated delivery date for this project is May 2022, for single wave pledges, and for Expedited Shipment pledges, September 2021 and May 2022 for wave 1 and 2 respectively, but keep in mind this is only an estimate. Also, due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others. We've done our best to minimize this as much as possible, and we are always happy to refund pledges if for some totally unforeseen reason the game can't be delivered at all.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nWe can refund you within 14 days of the campaign\u2019s end, fees included. After that, we have a policy of no questions asked, though that\u2019s minus Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we can\u2019t get back from them after 14 days). However, if we\u2019ve begun packaging your pledge for shipment, no refunds are possible. If a component cannot be delivered AT ALL, we refund that completely, including fees.\nAll refunds after the 14 days close of the campaign may be processed via PayPal or reversed via Stripe to your credit card at our discretion. Refunds within 14 days are reversed via Stripe to your credit card.\nThis project is being funded in USD and any refunds processed will be in USD for the exact amount received in USD, excluding any applicable fees depending on the time of the refund being processed.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look, materials and content of the rewards (and the project) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented while the Kickstarter project was active.\n\nIf you do not log in to the Pledge Manager and confirm your pledge in that system within 8 weeks of our notification via email to confirm your pledge, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received. However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your pledge if you contact us and confirm your pledge after the 8 week window has elapsed. Unconfirmed pledges make it difficult for us to plan production and logistics, and in the past have led to project delays. For this project we do not intend to allow this to happen, which may mean if you confirm your pledge too late, exclusive items may not be produced in sufficient quantity for your pledge.\n\nIf you confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods. We regret we are unable to ship to PO Boxes.\n\nAll backers that have selected \u201cNo Reward\u201d on Kickstarter, that wish to receive a reward for this campaign, must make sure to confirm their order by the Pledge Manager Deadline. We will announce the date for this once the Pledge Manager becomes live. All \u201cNo Reward\u201d pledges will be treated as donations once the Pledge Manager Deadline has passed.\n\nIf you do not accept these terms please do not pledge on this project, but instead wait for the retail release.\n\nTo make sure you have the best gaming experience, all CMON products are warrantied against manufacturing defects for 2 years from the of date purchase from CMON (proof of purchase required).

On a mug. From the creator of Journal 29 and The Cypher Files.\n\nConundrumug is a portable, porcelain-like, escape room in a cup.\nIt is the perfect gift for the escape room fan in your life, and the best way to check if you are already awake at work.\n\nHOW TO USE CONUNDRUMUG\n1. Prepare beverage.\n2. Pour beverage into the mug.\n3. Solve the puzzles & reward yourself with a satisfying sip!\nThe Conundrumug comes in 2 editions, each with a unique puzzle.\nThe Butterfly is our flagship mug, an elegant and mysterious object.\nThe J29 is a special edition inspired by the Journal 29 books and the adventures found within.\n\nBoth editions of the Conundrumug are what you could definitely call large cups, intended to hold enough of what fuels you through a day of hard work - or a healthy amount of reading on a rainy day.\nThe Conundrumug has enough of a table presence not to be ignored, while still having the subtle touches of minimalist design that distinguishes the Journal 29 style.\nThe austere, line-drawing aesthetic invites curious looks and stimulates the mind even when not trying to solve the puzzles they form. Do not be surprised at co-workers trying to surreptitiously solve your Conundrumug while feigning disinterest...\nThe Conundrumug is a 15 oz (445 ml) ceramic mug, is fully machine washable, and its printing is made to last.\nEach edition contains 9 puzzles with solutions that combine to solve the overall puzzle.\nPlease, do not attempt to solve the puzzles while the mug contains potable substances.\nIt is compatible with every known variety of coffee, every cultivar of tea, and tested with a range of quality single malt and blended whisky.

It was a groundbreaking publication that created its own category of puzzle in printed form.\nWith 63 puzzles in 148 pages, you may have to do certain things you may not want to do to a book, in order to solve them. Unconventional thought is rewarded, and the fate of an expedition to solve an alien mystery is decided.\nThe first book was followed by Journal 29 Revelation, which added 57(+?) puzzles and continued the story of the expedition with another series of intriguing riddles to figure out and obstacles to overcome.\nHere is what people have to say about Journal 29:\nGoodreads - BGG - Escape the Review -  EscapeTalk - Watch it Paint it\nYou will be able to obtain copies of Journal 29 and Journal 29 Revelation by adding them on to your pledge in the post-campaign pledge management platform.\nFor more information on the books, please visit: Journal29.com\n\nShipping\nConundrumug will be packed in a cardboard box with transparent windows. It is going to be shipped in such a way as to preserve the structural integrity of the mug itself, rather than the packaging, with the intention of keeping overall weight (and by extension the shipping costs) to a minimum.\nBackers wishing to give the Conundrumug as a gift will be able to choose additional external protective packaging for a small fee in the post-campaign pledge manager.\nWe will be using Backerkit as our post-campaign fulfillment suite and pre-order management platform, through which shipping costs may be paid and additional copies may be obtained.\nCertain countries do not appear on the list of available shipping destinations. This is due to past experiences and potential cost overruns due to weight fluctuations. Click the pledge level and please contact us via KS message if your country does not appear on the list. Regrettably, shipping to CIS and Brazil will not be possible. \nAdditional Items (e.g. more copies of Conundrumug, Journal 29 books, protective gift packaging) added on to your order in the pledge manager may incur additional shipping costs. You will be able to see all such costs before finalizing your order.\nSince we will only be charging cards for shipping & add-on costs before fulfillment begins, there will be plenty of time to modify your order. There will be backer updates and a final 48-hour notice before carts are locked and orders are charged.\nPlease note that Backers are responsible for any import fees, value-added taxes or other charges incurred in receiving Conundrumug to their location.\nNote that we can not be responsible for any re-shipping fees in case your package is returned as unclaimed, or if the address you provided is not valid.

With everyone vying for the same actions, players must time their use of proteins, hormones, and cell component cards in order to diversify their strategies and outplay the competition!\nCellulose is the sequel and counterpart to our 2017 release Cytosis (BGG). The two games have complementary themes and some familiar game systems, but Cellulose is a new standalone game that gives players greater control over available resources, strategic paths, and even the game length.\nFor each backer in the first 72 hours of the campaign, we're planting a tree! Our games use a lot of paper/cardboard/wood, and it takes a lot of energy to ship them around. We wanted to offset some of our production and have a backer bonus that wouldn't feel too bad to miss, so we're partnering with TreeSisters. They strategically plants trees to reforest areas where they're most needed to offset carbon, stabilize soil, and encourage biodiversity. They're very thoughtful about the best ways to do this, and we'd encourage you to check out their work. We plan to have an option to add more trees in the pledge manager.\n\nIn Cellulose, players compete over limited resources as they take advantage of powerful point-scoring combinations. They will race to build the cell wall, use hormones to signal plant growth for a steady source of water and CO2, and compete to contribute the most water to the cell\u2019s central vacuole. Once the cell wall is completely built, the game ends!\nEach round of Cellulose is one day played over three phases: Sunrise, Daytime, and Evening.\nSunrise Phase\nIn the Sunrise Phase, players collect resources and take bonus actions according to their markers on the plant board. Throughout the game, players will have the chance to use hormone signaling to advance along these tracks, earning additional benefits.\nDaytime Phase\nDuring the Daytime Phase, players take turns claiming the limited action spaces on the cell board in order to collect much-needed water and CO2, undergo photosynthesis in order to produce carbohydrates, and place carbohydrates into the cell wall, in cellulose form, to score points.\nPlayers may also acquire and play cell component cards, which grant them powerful bonuses.  Protein storage vacuoles immediately recover action markers, granting extra actions in the round. Enzymes allow chaining together bonus actions each time a new one is played. Specialization cards like hormone receptors create endgame scoring opportunities and special powers. \nEvening Phase\nIn the Evening, players recover their action markers, refresh the board, and build the next space on the cell wall.  Whoever has contributed the most water to the central vacuole will earn points and is given an additional action marker, which they can use in the following round.\nCheck out the draft rulebook for more gameplay information, or you can try Cellulose now on Tabletop Simulator \u2014 join our Discord Server to find a game!\n\nGenius Games creates games with compelling strategic gameplay and accurate science. We began designing Cellulose with careful research and modeling the major functions and tensions of plant cells: the scarcity trade-off of absorbing CO2 and losing water, the ability of plants to create their own food, and the growth cycles of a maturing plant. \nCellulose will include a \"Science Behind Cellulose\" booklet that describes key aspects of plant cell behavior and its relationship to Cellulose. You don't have to know any biology to play, but if you enjoy the game, we think you might enjoy the science as much as we have!\n\n\nCellulose includes an Automa Deck for solo play featuring a unique emerging strategy system, where the automated opponent will develop a responsive strategy over the game that determines how it plays. Some details in Update 6, with art to come!\nWe designed Cellulose to model some of the functions and tensions of plant cells in the context of the larger organism.  Scenarios tailor the story of your gameplay to different plant species with unique circumstances and adaptations.  Each Scenario will set realistic  conditions that push players to play in ways that parallel plant responses \u2014 while also creating exciting variations on how to play Cellulose.\nCellulose will initially include the Cactus scenario, showcasing how the Cactaceae family responds to sparse water availability: acquiring water is extra difficult, but using it well is very rewarding.\nWe hope to make more Scenarios available throughout the campaign.  If you have a great plant story to tell, get in touch! We\u2019re working on a couple ideas, but would love to work with your areas of study and expertise.\n\n\nShipping costs for each reward level and country are shown within each pledge level and will be charged with your pledge as soon as the campaign ends. The listed shipping charges are all subsidized to make it cheaper for you to get a copy of the game.  \nAll games pledged for during the campaign will be shipping from US, EU, UK, Canada, and Australia through several fulfillment centers, ensuring that we have \"Friendly Shipping\" (no additional import taxes for backers) to all countries in these regions. Sales Tax and VAT are included. \nPLEASE NOTE: Please note that any pledges not confirmed within 6 months from the time the campaign begins actual fulfillment may need to be sent outside of our normal fulfillment process, and so will incur increased costs, customs fees, and/or may receive the closest available product (if a limited print run is no longer available). No guarantees can be made concerning pledges not confirmed more than 6 months after the shipping begins.\nTo better serve backers in Asia, Middle East, Brazil, Africa and beyond, and help keep international shipping costs down, we are excited to be partnering with a number of local game stores throughout your regions with the help of VFI. We've been compiling a Directory of International Retailers who will be offering the game directly, with all Kickstarter options and stretch goals available here, during the normal fulfillment period. If you do not see your country listed among the shipping options, click here to contact VFI about about finding a participating store that's best for your region. You can also let your local game store know you're interested in preordering and have them contact VFI.\nMore science games are available through our website or at your local or online retailer.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAll projects have some level of risk, and ours is no different, particularly as the recent global pandemic has upset many aspects of the manufacturing and shipping industries.

We have accounted for current pre-production and manufacturing procedures, and think this is a goal we can achieve.

Sean Molley", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "The acclaimed setting of Symbaroum has enticed and fascinated fans of tabletop roleplaying games since the launch of the game in 2016. Now this dark and mysterious world welcomes an even wider audience, with the production of a Player\u2019s Guide, Gamemaster\u2019s Guide and Bestiary adapted for 5E, published under the Open Gaming License. Note that you will need the core 5E rulebooks to fully enjoy Ruins of Symbaroum.\nWelcome to the world of Symbaroum\n\nThe rich and nuanced Symbaroum setting revolves around the Ambrians \u2013 a civilization that two decades ago were forced to flee their ancestral soil after a devastating war. Their new and promised land borders on the vast forest of Davokar, covering the remnants of the Empire of Symbaroum which fell into ruin hundreds of years ago. Brimming with natural resources and mythical treasures, the forest calls out to the Ambrians to be explored and plundered, but the road into its depths lays far from open. Not only are the shadows beneath the foliage fraught with danger, monsters and infectious Corruption; there are also the elves of the Iron Pact who have vowed to die to keep anyone from disturbing the ruins of old, warning that the ancient evil of Symbaroum stirs in its sleep. \nAbout ten years ago, Queen Korinthia of the Ambrians finally vanquished Chieftan Haloban and his Jezites.\nNow you can join in the adventure! Seek out the barbarian clans to trade or to plunder their treasuries; establish a base of power among princes, guilds, or rebellious refugees in the capital city of Yndaros; survive encounters with trolls, dark-minded beasts, and undead warlords. But always remember the warnings spoken by the wardens of the forest: tread carefully and do not disturb the ruins of old, for the horrors of Davokar are about to awaken!\nIf you want a more in-depth introduction to the setting, download On the Nature of Davokar - a report from a lecture at the wine cellar Tuvinels in Yndaros.\n\n220+ pages, full color, hardback, sewn and glued spine, size 8.5 x 11 inches / 216 x 279 millimeters\nAside from the base core rules referenced in the 5E OGL, the Ruins of Symbaroum Player\u2019s Guide contains everything you need to create characters and set out to explore the world of Symbaroum. We provide this information in five major sections: an introduction to the setting, new rules for gameplay, new character origins, new character classes and feats, and a set of resources (equipment, spells, etcetera) for making characters and for use during play.\n\nNew Rules \nTo emphasize the dark fantasy nature of the setting, new rules for traveling and rests, social challenges, and magic are introduced. Regarding magic, wielders of mystical powers cannot avoid being affected by the ever-present threat of Corruption \u2014 the gathering of darkness to each character\u2019s Shadow which, if left untended, can manifest as terrible physical transformations and even the eventual loss of the character entirely, as Corruption consumes them mentally and physically.\n\nNew Origins\nAside from familiar folks such as humans, elves, and dwarves, the Symbaroum game world lets you create PCs and NPCs who are changelings, ogres, goblins, trolls and even a particular form of undead. Also, the more recognizable folks differ quite radically from what you would expect \u2013 for instance, in Symbaroum the elves (rather than orcs, trolls, or similar) could be described as the default enemy of adventurers and explorers.\nIn Ruins of Symbaroum, character Backgrounds are generally tied to Origins. The following Origins and Backgrounds are included in the Player's Guide: \nOrigins: Human (clanfolk), Dwarf, Elf and Troll\nNew Classes\nThe Ruins of Symbaroum Player\u2019s Guide presents the classes Captain, Hunter, Mystic, Scoundrel and Warrior \u2013 each with between four and seven different approaches (called Subclasses in the 5E OGL rules), and all of them with customized features up to the 20th level. The captain class is something special, as its members have the capability to command and train others, to improve the fighting ability of a group as a whole. \nApproaches: Ironsworn, Rune Smith, Weapon Master and Sorcerer\nThe graphic design of Ruins of Symbaroum borrows elements from the award-winning design of the original Symbaroum game.\nBoth these spreads are drafts (works-in-progress) from the Ruins of Symbaroum Player's Guide.\n\n200+ pages, full color, hardback, sewn and glued spine, size 8.5 x 11 inches / 216 x 279 millimeters; NOTE: the cover art is a placeholder and will be replaced.\nThe Ruins of Symbaroum Gamemaster\u2019s Guide provides tools and guidelines for running the game, developing the setting and creating your own adventures. The content may be summarized as follows:\n\nInvoking Symbaroum\n Gamemaster\u2019s Rules \u2013 on Ability Checks, Combat and Challenge Ratings, Time Within the Game, and Shadow and Corruption.\n The Setting \u2013 describes three settlements central to the setting: Thistle Hold, the town of explorers and treasure hunters; Yndaros, the capital city of the kingdom of Ambria; and Karvosti, the cliff of the barbarian High Chieftain deep inside the forest of Davokar.\nRunning Ruins of Symbaroum\n Building Game Worlds \u2013 guidelines on how to understand and develop the specific game world of Symbaroum.\n Adventures and Landscapes \u2013 instructions on creating adventures and adventure landscapes where the PCs dictate the course and outcome of the story.\n Chronicles \u2013 tips on how to design an adventure chronicle (also called campaign or adventure path) set in the world of Symbaroum.\n Magical Items and Artifacts \u2013 a huge number of mystical artifacts that all come with ready-made adventure hooks, as well as guidelines on how to create mystical artifacts of your own.\nOptional Rules\n\n200+ pages, full color, hardback, sewn and glued spine, size 8.5 x 11 inches / 216 x 279 millimeters; NOTE: the cover art is a placeholder and will be replaced.\nThe Ruins of Symbaroum Bestiary is in most respects a reflection of the award-winning Symbaroum Monster Codex, but with stats and rules adapted for 5E \u2013 the difference being that it also includes the monsters and adversaries featured in the Symbaroum Core Rulebook.\n\nHordes of the Eternal Night\nTwenty-seven original creatures that haunt, roam and wreak havoc on the world of Symbaroum.\nEach creature come with full color art, lore, an adventure Set-up and between one and four variants with different stat blocks\nBeasts & Monsters\nApproximately sixty creatures presented with shorter descriptions and stat blocks\nSorted into categories, such as Abominations, Predators, Spiders, Undead and Winged Creatures\n\nAdversaries\nApproximately seventy types of cultural beings presented with shorter descriptions and stat blocks\nSorted into categories, such as Champions of Prios, Elves, Outcasts, People of Davokar, Townsfolk and Trolls\nThe abominations of Davokar come in different shape and sizes...\n\nTo celebrate that the world of Symbaroum is finally coming to 5E, we're delighted to offer an unique Collector\u2019s Edition of the three main books, invluded in the pledge level Conqueror of Symbaroum. These deluxe tomes are bound in faux leather with gold foil-stamped adornments. The Collector's Edition is exclusive to this Kickstarter and will never be printed again. \n\nWe love friendly local gaming stores and want to forge an even closer relationship with you. We offer a retailer pledge, including five copies each of the three main books, at a discounted retailer price.\nBy taking part in this Kickstarter as a retailer, you make sure you get the books on time for the official release, and you get them at a lower cost than through most normal distribution channels.

We will collect this via our Pledge Manager after the campaign ends. This is so we can be fair to all our backers, as shipping is rarely one size fits all. Here is a list of rough shipping estimates:\nBrexit, Imports & More: We will ship from at least three local hubs: UK, US, and EU. That means that if you're in any of these regions, there will be no import fees for you. We might be able to set up a hub in Australia as well, but we cannot guarantee it yet.\nUnfortunately, import laws and customs in some specific countries have made it impossible for us to ship to them. We do not ship to: Belarus, Brazil, Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, South Africa and Afghanistan.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have done many successful kickstarters and have solid experience in the field.

Sean Molley", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Sidequest Decks are system agnostic tabletop RPG plot outlines & maps. They  are perfect to pull out when your players unexpectedly take a casual  comment for a story hook and you need an adventure idea, or for planning  what dangers lurk in your kingdom. You may even chain several together for an entire campaign!\nEach poker-sized card has a map on one side and a mini-adventure outline on the other side. The outline starts with a short description for the GM.  (Skim these to find an adventure that fits the circumstances.) Choose  between a couple of story hooks to get the adventure started. Next several encounter ideas move the game along. Customize them to match what your players do (drop some, change them to fit circumstances). Finally each card wraps up with one or two follow-up adventure ideas.\nWe've made 11 of these decks over the past few years, and now we're planning four more:\nStretch Goals\nFriendly Shipping\nWe have friendly shipping for the US, Canada, EU, UK, Australia, and NZ thanks to distributors in those countries. See \"Shipping\" below for details.\nMore About Each New Deck\nOver 50 cards of Monster Hunts & Lairs!  While  each will have a couple of unique ways to get the adventure going, these will also have a couple of cards dedicated to which creatures provide what magical effects (sorted by power/challenge) when crafting  magic items or powerful spells.  So if the characters plan to create an item that confers increased flight and regeneration, you'll have a couple of quests to find creatures with those abilities. Each sidequest card will also suggest alternate monsters for the adventure.\nThe Coastal Town Sidequest Deck has 51 mini-adventures designed to play out in a fantasy coastal area, with the adventure outline on one side and a relevant map on the other. The quests center on several VIPs in town who need help with various enterprises as well as threats off the coast & nearby caves. While the sidequests can stand on their own, they are also tailored to match the Coastal Townsfolk NPC Portraits Deck. Each numbered sidequest could involve an NPC of the same number in the NPC deck (though the sidequests do not mention them by name, so you can substitute in your own NPCs). The NPC decks are available as add-ons through this Kickstarter, see below.\nWe also made a deck of Frontier/Mining Townsfolk NPC deck in a previous project. Like the Coastal Town Quests deck, these mini-adventures use the characters from the frontier townsfolk deck, but they aren't required--fill in your own locations and characters as desired. The quests in this deck focus on the mines & a cult near town as well as several tasks key residents need help performing.\nThese 50+ sidequests focus on historical mysteries and lost artifacts of the real world. Perfect for a campaign of tomb raiding or following up on lost crusades.  While most are set in the first half of the 1900s, as outlines they are easy to move to other time periods or even different worlds & genres.\nVirtual Table Top Maps\nYou'll also get PNG versions of any maps we create so you can easily share them with your players--or print larger versions.  For example, we make any battlemats at a scale of 75 pixels per square.\nSamples\nTroll Stew, card 14 from the Monster Hunts Sidequest Deck\nSummoning Gone Awry! card 08 from the Monster Hunts Sidequest Deck\nBy The Rockets Red Glare, card 23 from the Monster Hunts Sidequest Deck\nThe Mummy Menace, card 36 from the Monster Hunts Sidequest Deck\nThe Price of Power, card 14 from the Coastal Town Sidequest Deck\nPocket Full of Trouble, card 18 from the Coastal Town Sidequest Deck\nStuffed to the Gills, card 28 from the Frontier Town Sidequest Deck\nLoot Tunnels, card 33 from the Frontier Town Sidequest Deck\nReviews\n\"If you are a game facilitator that enjoys creating within a confined  space, I think these products will appeal to you. The outlines are  enough to keep you moving forward for a night of play but have enough  room to add your own traps, puzzles, monsters, or mechanical widgets  that I feel they can make for a comfortable backboard to bounce ideas  against.\" --Gnome Stew\n\"On each of these cards you\u2019ll find what you need to fuel a session,  if not several\u2013it\u2019s not every day you can get a year\u2019s worth of  adventure ideas in a single box\" --Bell of Lost Souls \n\"Highly recommend checking them out... If your players need a break from the main story line of your campaign, give these Sidequest Decks a show.\" --A Pawn's Perspective\nPrior Sidequest Decks\nThe prior Sidequest Decks are:\nAfter the TPK (Total Party Kill) - Ideas for the afterlife and how the party may return to the world.\nArcane Academy - Adventures centered on a magic school, for kid characters or adults.\nDungeons, Caverns, & Ruins Fantasy - Fantasy adventures in those settings.\nHigh Seas, Pirates, & Ports - Fantasy & pirate adventures on the seas or port cities.\nHorror Fantasy - Fantasy adventures with undead/necromancy themes.\nLovecraftian/Paranormal - Adventure outlines based on story seeds left behind by Lovecraft and other paranormal stories.\nModern (Criminals, Spies, & Supers) - Quests that take place in the modern day with mafia, spy, and super-hero themes.\nPolitical & Urban Fantasy - Fantasy adventures in town and cities as well as political plots.\nScience Fantasy - Adventures inspired by Jack Vance's Dying Earth, Thundarr the Barbarian, etc.\nScience Fiction - Adventures set in the far future.\nWilderness & Frontier Fantasy - Fantasy adventures set in the wilderness or villages.\nAnd as mentioned above the two Town Sidequest decks are related to our prior NPC Sidequest Decks Kickstarter, but they aren't essential if you plan to fit them into your own towns and NPCs.  If you wish to get the NPC Decks as part of this Kickstarter, they are available as add-ons. For that Kickstarter, we made the following NPC Decks:\nAdventurers\nAnimals (Companions, Familiars, etc.)\nCoastal Townsfolk\nFrontier Townsfolk\nHenchmen & Hirelings\nYou can pick any of the above NPC decks as add-ons, but only the Coastal & Frontier Townsfolk are related to the new Sidequest Decks. \nAnd if you don't want to wait to get our prior decks, the Sidequest Decks and the NPC Decks are all available in our store now.\nPledging\nWhile we've set up rewards for one deck (or PDF), four decks, 10 decks, and 15 decks, you can pick any number of decks by adding more via add-ons.  For example, if you want 6 decks, pledge for four, then as you make your pledge you'll be asked if you want any add-ons.  Pick two more.  You'll also be able to add more via the pledge manager later but pledging during the Kickstarter helps us hit our goal & stretch goals. You'll pick which specific decks you want via the pledge manager.\nShipping\nWe're working with a company that has fulfillment centers located in the US, Canada, the EU, and Australia to minimize shipping fees for most backers.\nWe'll charge for shipping through the Pledge Manager which allows us to have more detail on the shipping rates.  After some recent kerfuffles with international shipping, we've decided to partner with another company to do fulfillment in order to make sure we have friendly shipping rates for the EU, UK, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and of course the USA.  While we'll ship elsewhere, postage rates to other locations may be high. Here are our ballpark shipping rates, which do include VAT (money amounts in US dollars) where applicable:\nUSA: Flat $6 (any number of decks)\nUK: 1 deck $13, 4 decks $17, 10 decks: $29, 15 decks: $35\nEU: 1 deck $16, 4 decks $22, 10 decks: $34, 15 decks: $40\nCanada: 1 deck $16, 4 decks $19, 10 decks: $30, 15 decks: $35\nAustralia: Flat $20, due to their low VAT and shipping.\nNew Zealand: 1 deck $25, 4 decks $30, 10 decks: $40, 15 decks: $50\nOf course, if rates go up, VAT changes, etc., we'll have to pass that on.\nCollaborators\nWe're blessed to work with a great team of innovative RPG creators:\nAaron Canton: Aaron is a professional writer who specializes in writing fantasy and science-fiction works, and has created content for a variety of literary universes,  role-playing games, and works of interactive fiction. \nKeith Curtis: Keith has done about half of the Cartography on our prior Sidequest Decks.  He has also done work for many other game companies, including work on the Babylon 5 d20 RPG, the Song of Ice & Fire RPG, and the updated 5e Keep on the Borderlands.\nMisha Handman: Misha is a professional novelist and gaming writer who lives in the  Pacific Northwest. He has contributed to several earlier Sidequest decks, as well as work for White Wolf Publications and UFO Press. He is  proud to be the only person with his name on the Internet.\nJosh Parry: Josh is a freelance TTRPG author who has worked with Nord Games and LoreSmyth as well as his own self-published titles on Itch.io and the DMs Guild. \nAndrew Shields: Andrew has worked on our NPC Decks and our system neutral creature cards.  He has his own publishing imprint called Fictive Fantasies and has worked for a number of other RPG publishers.\nJoe Wetzel: Owner of Inkwell Ideas, Joe will manage the project, write some of the adventures, make some of the maps, and pick up anything else that needs doing.\nAnd we're helped by Backer Kit:", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis will be our 18th Kickstarter in 10 full years!

Sean Molley", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "One's a real straight shooter. The other's a total wild card. But on the case, chasing down the murderer...they are always Partners.\n\nPartners is a totally unique new storytelling game for exactly two players. A love letter to the police procedural and mystery of the week television genre, players take the roles of detectives hot on a murder case each session of play. Not only are you playing the two irascible, ill-matched detectives, you'll also play their boss, their subordinates and other familiar roles of mystery television. All you need is this PDF and a single pack of regular playing cards.\nInterior art example. Final product may change.\nNever seen any crime TV shows? No problem: the system does all the work. In a new twist on most detective games, instead of players trying to uncover a plot created by a GM, random card draws slowly reveal which suspects are in play and what kind of clues they provide. Only when the final card is drawn in the final scene will the detectives - and the players - know who did it.  The game is designed to suit experienced roleplayers and crime fiction addicts as well as novices to either.  The literary focus also means it works perfectly as a shared journaling game, or for play across internet video chat.\n  Multi-award-winning game designer Steve Dee has been developing the game for over two years. The rules are written, the art is done and the PDF is ready to be sent out as soon as we fund. The last step that brings us to Kickstarter is turning it into a gorgeous fully-illustrated 140 page paperback, designed to look just like an old mystery novel. \nThe Book\nPartners is like no other RPG, so we want it to look like no other RPG as well. The book is a paperback designed to look like it was lifted straight from the 1980s pulp mysteries it emulates - without the actual low budget. 140 pages of text have been gorgeously laid-out in this evocative style by Matt Roberts, who won critical acclaim for his work on our previous RPG Relics. Complimenting this is the stylish pen and ink art by Kristopher Neal McClanahan throughout. Deep but economically written, it is a hefty tome of crime-busting storytelling tools that also fits in your pocket. The only other thing you need to play is a regular pack of cards. \nFinal Artwork May Change\nHow to Play\nOver the history of roleplaying games, designers have taken one of two approaches to mystery solving: either the GM knows the solution and must lead the players to it, or the players collectively come up with something plausible and the GM approves it. Partners instead builds a game where players discover the secrets through random card draws, then determine how and why they matter through their own invention. You won't tell the GM you'll head to the police station to check if any of the suspects have a criminal record in the hope that provides a lead, but rather be informed (for example) that the next clue lies in the criminal record, and which suspect it is about, then work together to describe the scene of how the information is procured, and exactly what it entails. \nThe prompts are drawn from random card draws that cross-reference several interwoven tables, combined with random word generation. Players then work together to turn the prompts into scenes and plots, with a few wrinkles thrown in if they are the Wild Card or the Straight Shooter. \nExample: Drawing a three of spades tells the players that the next scene is going to involve a suspect they have determined is a long time friend of the victim, who has a motive of \"Escape\", and that the evidence coming in will be fingerprints or DNA. A random word prompt gives the word \"trip\". The detectives decide that some blood is found at the scene that doesn't belong to the victim but the long time friend. They insist it was from an accident where they tripped one day and fell on a knife. It sounds fishy. The friend hides their eyes. Are they ashamed of what really happened? Is the friendship abusive?\nThis \"journaling\" structure makes the game half roleplaying game, half script-writing exercise, so it is perfect for writers as well as roleplayers. It also means it can be played easily online, both over Zoom or through email or text chat. All you need is one other player.\nYou can read a review of the beta rules or listen to one here, on Inside the Caravan.\nEDIT: Another review just came in! And another!  And this one. And one more right on the wire!\nAnd a video review from Jenders Gaming. And you can see an amazing playthrough by the Boredom Breakers. That playthrough starts with the show already made but here's a look at how shows are built from Sam and Jamie. \n\nWait, Only Two Players?\nPartners is designed for just two players, but like all good games it comes with options. It can be played with one, or up to six players. No GM is required.\n\nStretch Goals\nFor Stretch Goals, we'd love to bring extra modules to help you explore different subgenres of mystery! These are called Files, and will be short sharp digital documents that give new tables for suspects, motives and clues so the genre is modelled precisely. The assumption of the core game is modern day Law and Order style cops but there is so much more we can do!\nBackers at the digital level and above will get all achieved stretch goals!\n$8000 - The Teatime File - UNLOCKED!\nLike your mysteries solved by ladies of a certain age, be they Miss Marple, Jessica Fletcher, Precious Rambotswe or the ladies of Brindlewood Bay? Or just anyone who enjoys nice cups of tea and a bit fewer less blood-stained bathrooms? This is for you.\n$10000 - The Noir File - UNLOCKED!\nListen up, flatfoots. This city is a powder keg and when it blows, you better hope you're not tied to the barrel. These mean streets have a different kind of mystery; black and white on the surface but underneath nothing but shades of grey. \n$12000 - The Junior Detective File - UNLOCKED!\nNancy Drew, The Hardy Boys, Encyclopedia Brown, the Famous Five - the best detectives are always the young. Nobody pays attention to them but they see everything. This expansion lets you play with young players, great for kids to learn to write stories!\n$14000 - The Sherlock Holmes File - UNLOCKED!\nThe once and future king of the mystery genre is also the undisputed master of being the annoying Wild Card. And he remains the most represented character on film or TV by miles. We keep coming back to Sherlock, so let's make sure we do the original with style. \n$16000 - The Conspiracy File - UNLOCKED!\nEverything is connected. Nothing is true. Around every corner, someone is watching. This is not just unravelling a murder, but peeling back the layers, all of them, back to the shadowy grey puppet masters who control everything. A different kind of mystery...\n$18000 - The Cyber File - UNLOCKED!\nThe streets shine with neon and chrome. The world has changed, but crime is still the same, even if you can back up your brain online, robots can remember everything you ever said and corporations track your every move. The criminals just got smarter, so the detectives have to be smarter still.\n$20000 - The Eldritch File\nSomething is wrong here. The crime scene is a study in emerald. The witnesses saw something move like no living creature. The shadows hide more than just murderers but horrors few can bear to see. Will you solve the mystery if it costs you your very soul?\nAnd more to come!\nFulfillment and Postage\nOn this and future products, Tin Star Games is proud to announce our association with  Ink and Gumption.

Sean Molley", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Engage in power struggles and build your crew\u2019s reputation. Salvage and steal to survive and endure a ruthless universe. And above all, do anything you can to get that next job.\nThis sci-fi tabletop roleplaying game takes you to the grimy blue-collar future of a universe filled with risk, but also opportunity. DEATH IN SPACE presents a vision of space where technology is broken and dirty, and society is harsh and desperate. The player characters make up a crew with their own spacecraft or station, and take on the jobs they can find, in order to earn some well-needed bucks and get ahead in the power struggles of the stellar system. \nThe people making this game are Christian Plogfors and Carl Niblaeus of Stockholm Kartell. With this Kickstarter, we hope to get the funds to print the core book for the game, which should contain everything you need to start playing. We want to continue making material for the game after the game is out, in the form of adventures and other material to use in your game. \nFollow us on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter or on the website. \n\nHere's a preview of what we hope the standard edition of the book will look like (the holographic foil is stretchgoal-dependent):\nDEATH IN SPACE has its roots in the OSR scene, and follows similar design principles. In terms of setting and tone, inspiration comes primarily from the gritty science fiction of films like Outland and Prospect, classic westerns and the grimy future of early 80\u2019s science fiction movies. \nIt is a game about adventure and uncertain journeys out into the darkness of space, it is about you and your crew making a home of your spacecraft or station, in tough competition with everyone else, and most of all, it is about enduring in an abandoned frontier system where your only hope of surviving is to take any contract you can find, sometimes having to put your fate in your enemies' hands.\nInspiration\nThere are a lot of great and inspiring games out there. In terms of rules and approach, we have found inspiration in some form, large or small, in for example the following games (alphabetically listed): Coriolis, Into the Odd, Knave, Mothership, Mutant Year Zero, M\u00d6RK BORG, Offworlders, Solar Blades & Cosmic Spells, Mutant  (1989 edition), Traveller. Out of these, M\u00d6RK BORG, Knave and Coriolis deserve a special mention.\nMost of the inspiration for the tone and feel comes from movies and series. Some of these, that have inspired elements of the setting in one way or another, are (alphabetically listed): 2001: A Space Odyssey, A Fistful of Dollars, Alien, Blade Runner, Escape from New York, The Expanse, Firefly, IO, Moon, Outland, Prospect, Sunshine, Total Recall, The Warriors. \nVisually, much of the inspiration comes from abstract geometric art and design, and old computer interfaces and manuals.\n\nIn terms of music, one of our stretchgoals consists of a dedicated soundtrack for the game, by our musician collaborator Helium Kid Kanon. You can already listen to a preview of what that will sound like on Spotify (or scroll down to the stretchgoal list and listen immediately). \n\n\nStandard edition with holographic foil (not final)\nKickstarter exclusive edition (not final)\nOur main goal is to print a durable book of excellent quality that is easy to use at the table. We aim for an offset printed book with a sewn binding and possibly some fancy extras, depending on which stretchgoals are funded.\nThe book should land at about 128 pages and measure 6 by 9 inches. You can choose from two cover versions: the standard cover, and a special edition, only available in the Kickstarter.\nRegarding the covers, we plan for the special edition to be a cloth bound book, and the regular edition cover to be embellished with holographic foil (the silvery kind with reflecting colors), if we fund the corresponding stretchgoal (otherwise, the holographic parts will be a solid color). Apart from that, there are more possible upgrades to the book in stretchgoals. Basically, we don\u2019t want to pull any punches, and will try to make this as nice a book as possible.\nContentwise, the core rulebook contains everything you need to start playing immediately:\n Light-weight rules, intended to be easy to use and quick to learn\n  A system for quickly generating player characters and their spacecraft or space-station\n   60+ different modules to make the spacecraft or space-station your own\n  An introduction to the default setting, the Tenebris stellar system, its main locations and history (with many pieces of the puzzle left for you to fill in)\n  A system for repairs, where you collect spare parts to repair your stuff\n   20 cosmic mutations, representing physical manifestations of the void through your body\n  A system for spacecraft confrontations and boarding\n  An introductory scenario to jumpstart your campaign\n   40+ tables and generators packed with setting flavor\nBelow are some preliminary spreads to give you a flavor of how the interior of the book will look like:\nThe rules of DEATH IN SPACE are intended to be easy to use and hack but also to support and introduce the setting through the rules. While inspired by OSR games, the primary intent is not to be fully compatible with the rulesets and modules of old, but rather to try to capture the quickness and simplicity of these rulesets, tweak them according to our preferences and add some setting flavor (however, the rules are still close enough to other OSR rulesets that material should be possible to use with some simple conversions).\nThe basic rule when you try to accomplish something, say force open an airlock, or resist the effects of strange radiation, is to roll a d20 modified by one of four ability values, the ability determined by the nature of the task. If you roll over a fixed difficulty, you succeed. Failing checks gives you void points that you can use to increase your chances the next time you attempt something. Beware of saving up too many though, that might result in some nasty consequences. Void points are also used to activate cosmic mutations, strange powers from the void. \nThe player characters are all part of a crew with their own spacecraft or space-station, their sanctuary in a dangerous universe. Characters are generated in a quick randomized fashion, making it quick to make a new one when (not if)  your character suffers an accident. With a list of 60+ modules that provide new possibilities, the players can successively customize their ship or station and really make it their home and base of their adventures. If your ship or gear should break, you can repair it as soon as you collect the necessary spare parts. In case you encounter rivals on your travels, the rules for spacecraft confrontations determine the outcome and whether you can avoid being boarded.\nDEATH IN SPACE focuses on the Tenebris system\u2014a system of planets and objects revolving around the star Tenebris. It is a stellar system ravaged by war and strife, where a greed-fueled mining for precious gems ended in a conflict that laid waste to the intricate trade networks that ensured technological production. With no new parts to find, almost every single object built today, from weapon to spacecraft, is put together from discarded, salvaged or stolen parts. Nothing is new.\nAs if rebuilding the system after the war was not enough, there are reports from stargazing cosmologists that the universe has stopped expanding, and that it has instead begun collapsing at an accelerating rate. The news that civilization is at its end have created a sense of hopelessness and disorder, and in many sectors of the system former vassals have taken this chance to seize control from distant rulers.\nPlayer spacecraft concept by Mattias Astenvald\nIn the heart of the Tenebris system is the Iron Ring\u2014a huge, ring-like structure surrounding the moon Inauro like a belt of metal. This is the center of activity in the Tenebris system, and here miners and salvagers huddle in cramped living quarters, waiting for their next contract and a chance to earn some much needed money. In other parts of the Ring, far from the bustling market-places and common areas, there are dark, empty sectors, where shady types hide from attention.\nAmong the people of the Iron Ring, cryptic rumors are spreading about a void accelerating the collapse. A void that whispers strange sentences to the unlucky through the ever present thick static noise that grows stronger and stronger as you travel towards the edge of civilization. A void that infects and corrupts and imbues their bodies with odd powers.\nIn the middle of all this are the player characters: hard-working explorers and laborers hoping for a big score.\nThe 99% Void Safe reward level\nVoid protection. With this reward level you get the core book in print, with the cover of your choice (regular or special edition). The book will be wrapped in foil, to keep it safe from the strange void radiation. Better safe than sorry. \nThis is a mockup and not the final product.\nT-shirt. Premium cotton t-shirt from Spreadshirt. We're aiming for a design based on the book cover.\nHandouts. Two maps for the adventure in the core book\u2014Welcome to the Ring\u2014printed on high quality paper. \nStickers. One prismatic sticker portraying the spacecraft by Mattias Astenvald, and one holographic sticker using the graphics from the standard cover. These designs are exclusive for the Kickstarter. Below are preliminary designs.\nSetting location and printed note. We create a location connected to the Iron Ring\u2014an establishment, a station, spacecraft or similar\u2014and dedicate it to you. The locations are planned to be included in a table in the book. You get an individually crafted and printed thank-you letter that also includes the location name and description. \n50000 SEK \u2013 We make this book \nA high-quality offset printed 128-page book including all you need to start playing.\n75000 SEK \u2013 Holographic foil cover\nWe add holographic foil to the regular book cover and make this book glimmer.\n100000 SEK \u2013 Soundtrack\nWe ask our musician collaborator Helium Kid Kanon to make a full-length soundtrack for DEATH IN SPACE, that you can use as background music for your games. Every backer gets the soundtrack digitally, and it will also be made available on Spotify and Bandcamp. Here is how Helium Kid Kanon describes the soundscape for DEATH IN SPACE:\n\"Sound waves from dark, vibrating aegrine were found on a 570 million year old, volcanic island. When passed through a cloud chamber, they turn into an oozing, analog warmth, layered with sparkles of cosmic noise. These are some of the parts, arranged into a multi layered space. A composition that can trigger chronesthesia. The soundscape for DEATH IN SPACE.\"\n 150000 SEK \u2013 Pamphlet adventure\nWe make a pamphlet adventure. All backers get it in pdf form and we include it in print with all rewards except Orbit Vagabond and Event Horizon Diver.\n200000 SEK \u2013 More illustrations\nWe add more spacecraft illustrations by artist Mattias Astenvald to the book.\n250000 SEK \u2013 Map poster\nWe make a map poster of the Tenebris system. For the map, we will receive some help from graphic designer and animator Gabriel Herrin. Gabriel did some work on the movie Prospect \u2013 one of the big sources of inspiration for DEATH IN SPACE \u2013 so we are very happy to have him onboard! All backers get it in pdf form and we include it in print with all rewards except Orbit Vagabond and Event Horizon Diver. Note that logos are placeholders and will be replaced.\n300000 SEK \u2013 Bookmark ribbon \nWe add a bookmark ribbon to the book, to make it easier to find the page you\u2019re always flipping to.   \n350000 SEK \u2013 More illustrations\nWe add even more spacecraft illustrations by our artist Mattias Astenvald to the book.\n500000 SEK \u2013 New adventure\nWe ask Rickard Antroia to write an adventure for us. The adventure will be released in pdf and all backers get it digitally. Rickard is a writer and designer who has written adventures for Coriolis and Tales from the Loop and worked with editing on Tales from the Loop, Things from the Flood, Vaesen and Alien RPG. He wants to take you on an epic journey to the edge of the universe.\n700000 SEK \u2013 Cults and factions\nPelle Nilsson - from Ockult \u00d6rtm\u00e4stare Games, author of games such as M\u00d6RK BORG and Barkh\u00e4xan among others, contributes to the game by providing a number of cults or factions of the Tenebris system that you can use in your game.\n\n800000 SEK \u2013 Online generator \nWe ask Karl Druid to make an online character generator for us. Karl writes material and makes virtual paraphernalia for tabletop RPGs. He is for example behind the M\u00d6RK BORG online generators scvmbirther and dngngen.  \n\n900000 SEK \u2013 Printed pamphlet #2 \nWe print the adventure pamphlet by Rickard Antroia from the 500k stretch goal. All backers with physical reward levels get it (all reward levels except Orbit Vagabond and Event Horizon Diver). This means that if you get the printed book, you get two different printed adventure pamphlets with it.\n\n1,100,000 SEK \u2013 Solar Fields song and Tenebris system soundscape\nMagnus Birgersson, also known under the name Solar Fields, will write and produce a track inspired by the material included in the book! Solar Fields has released 17 albums and appeared in over 60 compilations, including the in-game scores for the computer games Mirror's Edge and Mirror's Edge Catalyst. You can find his music on Spotify and on other platforms.   \nIn addition, if we pass this stretchgoal, Helium Kid Kanon will create a number of immersive soundscapes that represent various locations and environments in the Tenebris system. A perfect background to amplify your experience while exploring our world.  \nThe songs for the soundtrack and the soundscapes will be published on streaming platforms like Spotify, and backers get them digitally.\nThe majority of the money we collect will fund the printing cost for the book and any other funded print material. The remaining funds will be used to pay our collaborators for their work and costs. \nDEATH IN SPACE will be published by Free League Workshop, Free League Publishing's sublabel for externally designed games. They are responsible for shipping and distribution.\nWe plan to use a pledge manager, and charge shipping separately after the campaign has ended. See the map for our current best estimates of shipping costs*. The current plan is to ship the game from the UK as the default, but with distribution hubs in the EU and US as well. \n* This is based on shipping one book, the map and a pamphlet, and the Moon Outlaw and 99% Void Safe reward levels may therefore incur some extra shipping charges\n\nChristian Plogfors. When he is not writing for DEATH IN SPACE, Christian spends the rest of his time on the layout and graphics for the game. He has been designing worlds for computer games for 18 years, now as a senior level designer, and has contributed to games such as Battlefield, Mirror\u2019s Edge and Star Wars Battlefront. When relaxing, he likes to write material for his Into the Odd hack Into the Jungle. He has also contributed with material and layout for the Night Yeast zine.\nCarl Niblaeus. While almost every sentence of the game has been dissected by both Carl and Christian, Carl has had the last word on much of the language in the book. In the RPG world, Carl has contributed to M\u00d6RK BORG zine Feretory, the Night Yeast zine, and released one or two old school modules before that. He also helps running the so-called Old School Corner (\u201cOld School-h\u00f6rnan\u201d) at GothCon, Sweden\u2019s largest RPG con. There he referees his own and others\u2019 creations. Outside of RPGs, Carl has a PhD in astroparticle physics, and has spent many years researching the underpinnings of our own universe. In DEATH IN SPACE, this knowledge is used to inspire the creation of another.\nCollaborators\nApart from us there are a number of collaborators who provide invaluable assistance in making the game.\nJohan Nohr. As one half of the team behind M\u00d6RK BORG, Johan should be well-known to many in our audience. With M\u00d6RK BORG, he works tirelessly to make it look as great as it does, and we are very happy to have him onboard. In DEATH IN SPACE, Johan has worked with the illustrations, adding touches to give them a more personal feel.\nMattias Astenvald. Mattias is an artist located in Uppsala, Sweden, working in the digital gaming industry. For our game, he helps make reality of our spacecraft and we hope to make use of his great skills as much as we can. \nGabriel Herrin. Seattle-based graphic designer and animator. Gabriel did some work on the movie Prospect, which is one of the big sources of inspiration for DEATH IN SPACE, so we're really happy have him onboard. He will help us make company logos for the map poster. Check out more of his stuff here.\nStockholm Kartell is a creative coven of writers, designers and idiots.

After the campaign we want to spend about 2 months finalising the last few details before doing a proper round of editing and proofreading with a native English speaker.

Due to start a year-long world tour, they left their family, fans and sizeable fortunes behind. Clues about their disappearance have started to be identified in their tour brochures and prolific output by their fans, some of whom want the truth revealed and others who are determined to keep it buried.\nA secret behind the band's success.\n A secret which would ruin them if it was revealed. \nA secret that the die-hard fans would do anything to protect from being revealed.\nThe Ashwell project came from a belief that puzzles with a narrative held more depth and interest for players. The Ashwell Tour Brochure is a professionally-designed and beautifully printed realisation of this belief. With a real-world reveal, the puzzles combine maths, logic, wordplay and decoding.\nBehind beautiful but innocuous pages lie puzzles and secrets.\nPlayers can also continue the story with their own fanzine, using our keepsake elements booklet and hand bound notebook. We want the answers to the brochure puzzle to be the stepping stones for the next part of the story. We have three possible storylines for creators to adapt, or you can generate your own - we would be delighted with either.\nUse Ashwell Keepsake Elements to create a fanzine, a continuation story, a springboard for the puzzle investigation. Let your creativity explore all bounds.\nAll physical rewards feature the full colour, glossy print tour brochure, professionally litho printed on 130gsm coated paper. An accompanying Hints App will help you along the way should you need a guiding hand.  \nThere is a puzzle on almost every page, with each directly leading to a clue in the meta puzzle. You will require an internet connection for the final solution, but should be able to solve all the puzzles leading up to the final meta puzzle without one.  We don't want to give anything more away, but they range from the easy to the very hard. We estimate the game play time to be 1.5 - 3 hours, dependent on your puzzle experience and hint use.\nAlso available is a booklet of additional logos, images and mini puzzles for you to use to create your own keepsake fanzine. \nUse it to create a diary of solving the puzzles, logging the mysteries, or even continuing the story further. We have created  three possible future storylines for those who would like them, but would be enormously excited to see which other directions players may take the story.\n\nWe are  offering the option of buying an exclusive handbound A5 Notebook in which you can create your fanzine as part of the package. This uses high quality recycled cartridge paper, and is hand sewn with a fabric binding for a secure fit and beautiful finish.\nShould you wish to become part of the tour crew and have your name in the publication, this limited reward is also available. If you really want to indulge yourself, you can even become part of the band! Included with this limited option is to have a significant date added to the tour dates list. An amazing birthday/wedding/anniversary present!\nWe have been so supported by the puzzle community that we have avoided spending any money at all on advertising. Instead, we are ring-fencing this money, and will  use it to support a fledgling puzzle project. At \u00a35,000, we will put \u00a3250 into this pot - enough for a puzzle startup to get some printed samples, carry out some product research, commission a designer. More details after the campaign, but this will be offered to anyone who has pledged for a physical product in this campaign, and will operate by application. If you have any thoughts on this, please do message us, and we will build up a FAQ in response!\nWe are The Escapages, writers and publishers of Escape Puzzle Games. We successfully funded Flatpak in 2019 (a puzzle book disguised as a furniture catalogue) and Full Deck in 2020 (a three-book serial killer and crime board collection), and this is the first of our Kickstarters for 2021. Both the brochure and hints app have been fully play tested.\nThis project was created by Stephen, one half of the Escapages, after a conversation with his music-mad son during a woodland walk in lockdown. It mixes high production values, music, puzzles, keepsakes, journaling, scrapbooking and a real-life event which has seemingly been hidden under the fiction radar!\nHere are some lovely comments from some of our play testers:\nDespite everything being essentially ready for print, the current climate makes us cautious to promise anything too quickly.

REACHED!\n\nBOSTON METAPHYSICAL SOCIETY needs your help to print our new story, THE BOOK OF DEMONS (41 page story in a 48 page perfect bound book) and produce our NEW PLAGUE DOCTOR LAPEL PIN!\nHere's our cover:\n\nWho will love Boston Metaphysical Society?\nFans of Penny Dreadful, Girl Genius, Ruse, steampunk and gaslamp fantasy stories.\nPeople who like to read paranormal, historical fiction, and/or alternate history.\nIf you like character-driven comics with a mix of paranormal and science fiction, then these are the comics for you!\nTHE STORY\nWhen Erin, Caitlin\u2019s mother, discovers her daughter can control a demon, she is outraged. In her mind, only a Great House has the right to such power, but who will listen to a poor Irish woman? House Lowell will. For Alice Lowell has inherited an old Puritan journal which describes how to find and enslave a demon, but she needs a psychic to do it. Kidnapping Caitlin is the first step in a plan to rid her husband\u2019s House of debt. But with a demon to do their bidding, her ambitions will be limitless.\nThe Book of Demons can be read as a standalone, but it is a continuation of Ghosts and Demons.\nFirst Three Pages:\nNEW TO BOSTON METAPHYSICAL SOCIETY?\nIf you are new to the series, the original six issue mini-series is about an ex-Pinkerton detective, a spirit photographer, and a genius scientist who battle supernatural forces in late 1800\u2019s Boston. They  live in an alternate steampunk history where ghosts and demons are a normal part of life. Families known as the Great Houses control the economy of the Great States of America while the middle class and lower classes sole purpose are to serve the Great Houses.\nThe original trade paperback is available in several reward tiers.\nWHAT'S IN THE TRADE?\nI'm glad you asked. Not only does it include all six issues from the  original mini-series as well as the cover art, but it also contains a  ten page  short story called, Hunter-Killer,  and additional bonus pages. With art by Emily Hu and coloring by Gloria Caeli, the story is set at the beginning of the House Wars (my version of the American Civil War) and features the crew of a prototype airship.  I introduce three new characters: Gwen Warrick - Captain;  Emmet Rochester - Navigator; and Joaquin Medina - Engineer.\nThe complete sequential art version of Hunter-Killer will ONLY be available in the trade.\nWHAT ELSE IS THERE?\nOur three previous standalone sequels will be available as well. And they are:\nTHE SCOURGE OF THE MECHANICAL MEN \nSTORY: Granville and Tesla are in a race for time to save Boston from a mysterious disease that turns human beings into machines.\n\nTHE SPIRIT OF REBELLION \n STORY: Caitlin flees to Philadelphia only to discover a ghost, a rebellion, and perhaps, her destiny.\n\nGHOSTS AND DEMONS \n STORY:  A disturbing dream leads Caitlin and the team to face off with a new enemy.\nTHE BOSTON METAPHYSICAL SOCIETY COLORING BOOK:\nTwenty (20) gorgeous illustrations for you to relax  and color away to your heart's content. Includes illustrations of  Samuel, Granville, Caitlin, Tesla, Houdini, and more! It will be an 8  1/2 x 11 book and is suitable for all ages. Art by Alejandro Lee\nOTHER REWARDS\nIn addition to THE BOOK OF DEMONS, we are offering the trade paperback, the anthology Boston Metaphysical Society: Prelude, the first novel set in this universe, Boston Metaphysical Society: A Storm of Secrets, plus a NEW PLAGUE DOCTOR LAPEL PIN. It is 1 inch in diameter and will be an antique bronze color.

(As long as supplies last.)\nBOSTON METAPHYSICAL SOCIETY: A STORM OF SECRETS\nThe award winning novel, BOSTON METAPHYSICAL SOCIETY: A STORM OF SECRETS, is a prequel to the original graphic novel though it can be read as a standalone. It takes place five years prior to the original series.\nIt was awarded a Silver Medal as well as The Write Companion Award for Best Overall TOP PICK - Adult, Children's and Young Adult categories in the 2019 Feathered Quill Book Awards.\nStory: As the Great Houses of Boston jockey for power, an ex-Pinkerton detective, his psychic wife, and his father-in-law must contend with treachery, subterfuge, and a new supernatural threat, in this political and supernatural thriller set in an alternate-history Boston of 1890.\nThe award winning cover is by Luisa Preissler. Title Graphics by Anke Koopman.\n\nAnd if you haven't read Boston Metaphysical Society: Prelude yet, then this would be the perfect time to get it. This anthology of short stories and novellas includes stories of how Granville and Samuel met and their first case together; what set Caitlin on her path; and how Samuel met his wife, Elizabeth Weldsmore Hunter. Several reward tiers  include it as either a pdf or print version.\nThe Underground - A Boston Metaphysical Society Short Story (Available as an Add-on for all tiers and is already included in the Granville Woods and All Things BMS tiers.) \nIn The Underground,  Andrew O'Sullivan takes his young daughter, Caitlin, on a case that might reveal a past and a potential future neither of them expected. This is a prose story and is available in Epub or mobi formats. (Previously published in Last Stop on the #13.)\nNEW REWARD TIER!\nSPECIAL COMMISSION REWARD TIER (KICKSTARTER EXCLUSIVE)\nEver wanted to time travel?

My stalwart shipping envelopes met their match at USPS, so this year I will be using the ULINE S-165 cardboard mailers (or their equivalent) along with boards and extra packing material for anything outside of California (and probably in California as well.) Those who order the Nothing But Books and All Things BMS will get the usual sturdy cardboard box as those have worked well in the past.\nINTERNATIONAL SHIPPING: We were able to obtain discounted international postage for over 55 countries this year. I have passed on those savings to you depending on your shipping address. To extend these savings even further, for those who pledge to the Nothing But Books or the All Things BMS, and it is shipped to one of those 55 countries, we will be splitting up the rewards into two boxes in order for you to receive the discount. \nTHE TEAM FOR THE SEQUELS:\nMadeleine Holly-Rosing - Writer/Creator: A   TV, feature film, comic book writer, and novelist, Madeleine holds an   MFA in Screenwriting from UCLA where she won numerous awards as well as  the Sloan Fellowship.

Inspired by fantasy and the art of storytelling,   Holly-Rosing uses her imagination to create a fantastic story that is   both well-written and fearless.\" - Valerie Complex (Fansided)\n\"If you have a taste for an intelligent, well written, elegantly   illustrated award winning independent book, you can't go wrong with   Boston Metaphysical Society!\" - Alex Yarde (The Good Man Project)\n\"This very inventive series posits a totally believable Steampunk   world that is populated by appealing characters who act (and react) in   believable manners to the extraordinary events that swirl around them.\"  -  Robert Sodaro (Comic Reviewer at Examiner.com)\nTHE STORY BEHIND THE STORY\nI love writing BOSTON METAPHYSICAL SOCIETY.  Not only does it bring my  love of science fiction and history  together, (which by the way, equals  steampunk), the steampunk time  period allows me to address the themes  of classism, sexism, and racism  in America in a thoughtful and engaging  way. For at its very core,  BOSTON METAPHYSICAL SOCIETY is an American  story. And you can't tell an  American story without including women and  people of color.\nIt has been and always will be important to me to write characters  who, though they come from diverse backgrounds and have different  points  of view, are able to work together for the common good.\nADD-ONS\nI have decided not to use the option of Kickstarter add-ons during this campaign, though I will be using Backerkit when I send out the surveys if you'd like to add anything to your pledge.\nSTRETCH GOALS\nSTRETCH GOAL #1 - $5,700 - (KICKSTARTER EXCLUSIVE) **REACHED!**\nBackers who have pledged $10 or more to a physical reward will  receive  this wonderful 8 1/2 x 11 inch print on 10 pt. cardstock gloss  by the  amazing Ashley Woods. \nAshley has worked for Marvel, Dark Horse, IDW, and Stranger Comics (Niobe).

Sean Molley", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Sentinels of the Multiverse: Definitive Edition\n\nA mad scientist holds the whole world hostage with his doomsday device. A self-aware AI in a massive robotic form rampages through major cities, bent on the destruction of all human life. A chaotic earth spirit uses her control over the natural elements of the world to threaten all of humanity! A superpower supremacist leads her army of powerful followers to defeat any who would oppose her goal of global conquest! Only a few stalwart Heroes stand in the way of all these Villains and their dastardly plots!\nThese stories and more all come from the pages of Sentinel Comics, and in Sentinels of the Multiverse, you play out those stories! You and your friends take control of an array of powerful Heroes, standing resolute in the face of danger to protect the world. Can you defeat the Villains and save the world? Or will the Villains triumph, forcing the Heroes to regroup and fight another day?\nSentinels of the Multiverse is back, and better than ever! With all-new art, notably streamlined mechanics, and new stories to experience, this is the award-winning cooperative comic-book card game you\u2019ve been waiting for!\nWe want this Kickstarter campaign to be as streamlined and efficient as the gameplay of this Definitive Edition of Sentinels of the Multiverse! There are only two pledge levels: 1) get the game, and 2) get the game and sleeves for every card in it. That\u2019s it. Easy-peasy. With both pledge levels, you get a shiny set of foil cards for each of the character cards in the game! You could look at it as getting the $60 core game for $49, plus a $20 pack of foil hero character cards, villain character cards, and event cards for just $1! Also, you get the game/sleeves cheaper than it\u2019ll be at retail, and it\u2019ll get shipped to you before anyone or anywhere else!\nLet\u2019s talk about Stretch Goals: we\u2019re not doing them! This campaign is about making the best version of Sentinels that we can. The Definitive version, if I may. So, this means we\u2019ve known 100% of what\u2019s going into it for months. No matter how massive this campaign gets (fingers crossed!) there are no stretch goals, because every dollar of this campaign goes to creating these games and sleeves, printing them, and shipping them to you!\nThere are Add-Ons available as part of this campaign. They\u2019re for the same stuff as the two pledge levels: extra copies of the core game, and more sleeves! Every copy of the core game comes with a pack of the foil cards, so that's already built into that add-on. And the set of sleeves is the same as the one that's part of the pledge level!\nSo, if you want more of any of those things, add them in the Add-Ons section when you back the campaign. Straightforward as can be!\nSentinels of the Multiverse is a cooperative game in which each player controls a Hero, using their powers, abilities, and wits to work together with their fellow Heroes and save the world!\nEach game involves three to five Heroes fighting against one Villain in a perilous Environment. The game is fully cooperative, so the Villain and Environment aren\u2019t run by a dedicated player, but rather are controlled by turning over cards from their decks and following the instructions on those cards.\nEach Hero, Villain, and Environment are represented by a deck of cards. Heroes and Villains also have character cards, which provide their Hit Points and other information specific to that character.\nThe game starts with the Villain turn, then each of the Heroes in turn order clockwise around the table. The round ends with the Environment turn. After the Environment turn, repeat the round, starting with the Villain turn! The game continues in this order until the Heroes save the Multiverse, or the Villain defeats the meddling Heroes, one way or another.\nIn updates to this campaign, we go more in-depth on the contents of the box, but know that this core game comes with a TON of content, including:\n12 Heroes (Here's an update all about Heroes!)\n6 Villains (This update is all about Villains!)\n6 Environments (Look! An update about Environments!)\n12 Hero Variant cards & 12 Event cards (An update about Variants and Events!)\nDivider cards for each deck\nA Rulebook AND a Lore Book! (Here's the entire Rulebook!)\nHP spinners & Tracking Tokens (Even an update about components?!)\nAnd a dedicated token box!\nHey, folks! Christopher Badell here. I\u2019m the designer of Sentinels of the Multiverse and the writer of Sentinel Comics. In 2010, Adam Rebottaro (the artist for everything Sentinel Comics \u2014 you heard that right: Adam did 100% of the art you see in this campaign and this game!) and I had an idea for how to make the game we always wanted to play. A cooperative card game about comic books; about costumed heroes with powers and abilities working together against far greater threats than any of the heroes could handle on their own, but by working together, they could overcome. A game based in a vibrant world that represented many decades of comic book history, full of rich and dynamic environments that themselves played a part in the gameplay. This game was Sentinels of the Multiverse. We had a very ambitious idea of what this game could be, but part of that ambition did not involve what sort of product the game might be. Even when we teamed up with my friend Paul Bender \u2014 who is now the CEO of Greater Than Games \u2014 to create a company and publish this game, none of us really knew just how big this game could grow, or what this game could end up meaning to so many people.\nOver a decade later, we have a bit better of an idea. The Sentinels of the Multiverse core game and many expansions have sold hundreds of thousands of copies around the world, won numerous awards, and inspired countless fan art, fanfiction, and scores of cosplayers. The world of Sentinel Comics has taken many forms, including a variety of board games, a hit podcast, and a recently released roleplaying game. But, even still, the most popular thing to come out of Sentinel Comics is the first thing: the Sentinels of the Multiverse card game.\nWe created Sentinels of the Multiverse over ten years ago, and we have learned a LOT since then. I\u2019m a better writer and designer than I was then, Adam is a far better artist, and Greater Than Games is significantly better at making quality products. We have a bigger and better team than ever before. The original version of Sentinels was entirely made by me and Adam just at the start of our careers working in games, and it shows. And yet, it\u2019s still one of our top selling games. It deserves another look \u2014 a new, more polished, more definitive edition.\nAnd that brings us here, to the Sentinels of the Multiverse: Definitive Edition Kickstarter campaign! If you\u2019re familiar with Sentinels, this is certainly still the game that you recognize, but cleaned up and improved in just about every way. All of the art is brand new. The writing and game design have both been stripped down to their core elements and rebuilt better and cleaner than before \u2014 the game plays more swiftly and smoothly now, and everything happening on the table is communicated in a way that keeps the players engaged, and the action moving forward. All of the graphic design is significantly improved, thanks to the expertise of our graphic designers, Rae Henderson and Darrell Louder. And the polish on the game shines brightly, thanks to the development and playtesting help of our Game Developer Manager Chris Burton and quite a few playtesters. We started working on this game in early 2020, and most of the last half of the year was spent in intensive playtesting to make sure this is the best version of Sentinels of the Multiverse that anyone has ever seen.\nIs this game for you? Only you can decide! Hopefully the information in this campaign, the updates we\u2019ll post over the course of it, and the helpful words from our playtesters (in the Testimonials section below) will give you some useful information. Plus, we\u2019re offering a money-back guarantee \u2014 if you get it and you don\u2019t like it, send it back and we\u2019ll fully refund you. See more in the Money-Back Guarantee section, below. But first! Here are some video and audio recordings that might further convince you, in our own words!\nI was very recently interviewed by Trevor, the A/V mastermind for GTG and producer of The Letters Page Podcast about just what all this is about:\nTrevor also interviewed me and Adam on the Greater Than Games podcast, which you can listen to here!\nAlso, a couple weeks ago, we played a game of Sentinels of the Multiverse: Definitive Edition online using Tabletop Simulator to introduce the game to our friends Patrick Leder and Stras Acimovic. Want to see how it went, and what they thought? Check it out!\nWe spent the second half of 2020 and the first couple months of 2021 heavily playtesting all of the Definitive Edition material. Going into that process, a lot of our playtesters had a wide variety of opinions... and those opinions evolved significantly over the course of playtesting! Here are some of their thoughts:\n\n\"I was skeptical when I first heard about Sentinel of the Multiverse: Definitive Edition. I had already put hundreds of hours into both the physical and digital versions of the current game and didn\u2019t think any small improvements could justify the costs of buying it all over again. But then I played it, and now I\u2019m a believer. Omnitron feels more like Omnitron as he relentlessly builds up and then inevitably eradicates you. Bunker feels more like Bunker as his modes come and go and he maintains his various ordnances while scouring the field in fire. Megalopolis feels more like megalopolis as you scramble to keep a lid on the everyday emergencies popping up while the villain attacks. Playing against villains using their events rules feels like an entirely new game without greatly increasing the complexity, while critical events bring out mind blowing showdowns, sometimes against foes you would not expect. It\u2019s smoother, sleeker, and dare I say just Greater. \nIf you thought the first game was too clunky, you\u2019ll love it. And if you loved the first game, you\u2019ll fall in love all over again.\"\n \u2014Brian Jewett, A.K.A. The Cult of Gloom\n\n\"When we playtesters were first told about Definitive Edition, I was excited to playtest it because I love Sentinels, but figured I wasn't going to buy it. Why buy a new game when it's mostly just new art, with just a few notably revised decks? But then we saw more and more, and more of the decks got tweaked, that the final product is amazing. Complex long-haul heroes can set up and be useful much more quickly. Simple heroes that used to do loosely-associated random things have tighter themes and more interesting mechanics. Cheese strategies have been de-cheesed. Villains are less likely to decide a game with a single poorly-timed play. What used to be \"challenge mode\" and came from a semi-secret downloadable PDF is now in the box, with better playtesting, and is part of a light campaign mode. What used to be \"promo\" content--variant heroes and villains which could only be found in Kickstarters and from cons--are also now included in the box, are also much more solidly designed, and in this one box there are already as many variant villains as the entire run of Enhanced Edition.\nOriginally I wasn't planning to get in on the Kickstarter, because, as much as I love Definitive Edition, it does only come with 24 decks instead of the over 100 Enhanced Edition decks I already own. But by the time it's all out again, it's going to be not only much better quality, but have much more content to boot. And Christopher has given us some ideas of what he's thinking about for the future, and it sounds really, really promising. (Plus, if anything isn't good, he's being really good about listening to feedback from us playtesters, and we're giving him plenty.) Anyone who knows me from other communities will know that I tend to be a hyper-critical contrarian. Enhanced Edition was my favorite sub-2-hour tabletop game of all time, and Definitive Edition is shaping up to be much better. If you like co-op tabletop games at all, this is the one you want.\"\n \u2014Mindwanderer\n\n\"I initially had some reservations about Definitive Edition. While I would like to see new art, that alone wouldn't have been enough to sway me. By the end of playtesting, it had blown me away.  Bunker feels fantastic now. Fanatic screams her theme and playstyle like a real fanatical angel would. Absolute Zero doesn't just give up when his equipment is destroyed. Tempest actually feels like someone with control over the weather instead of just someone that shoots lightning bolts willy-nilly. \nWhile the mechanics have been cleaned up a good bit and there has been an overall balance overhaul, what really stands out to me is how much each hero feels like the heroes I've been hearing about on The Letters Page. The mapping of theme to mechanics is just stellar. I love the original game, and I will no doubt still play it from time to time, but I greatly look forward to DE hitting my table (and also hope that Handelabra makes a digital version, so it can hit my screen as well).\"\n \u2014Bryan Graham, A.K.A. Broccoli\n\n\"I love Sentinels of the Multiverse. We have a bi-weekly group that has been playing for nearly a decade, now! We have all things Sentinels-related, and thoroughly enjoy it. Now that we've played Definitive Edition, though, it's by far our preferred version. The consistency, the mechanical flavor, the art, everything about it is significantly improved! My spouse loved Fanatic before, but now she prefers the DE version and won't even play the original. I enjoy Absolute Zero and Argent Adept, both of whom recover from loss of cards in play much better than ever before. Things like that just make the game much more fun to play.\"\n \u2014Russ Luzetski, A.K.A. Rabit\n\n\"I was definitely among the people who weren't convinced of the value-to-existing-fans of DE. But the Events, Critical Events, and ability to play through the Canonical Battles in the Canonical order as a campaign has made a convert of me. I was always going to buy DE anyway (even with 40+ years of tabletop gaming behind me, Sentinels is my all-time favorite, plus Adam's art is always worth the price of admission) but now I know that not only will the Definitive Edition be sitting on my shelf, but it will be hitting my table as well.\nRa has been my favorite Sentinels Hero since the original game came out. The cards that I loved in his old deck are still all there in this new version (several with upgrades), and the cards I didn't care for have been replaced with new, and much better, cards. Consuming Flame is my new favorite. And the Staff or Ra has been upgraded and has the potential to do a single massive blast of fire! Villains beware!\"\n \u2014Michael J. Ahlers, A.K.A. YakGuardian\n\n\"Sentinels of the Multiverse: Definitive Edition retells the stories you know and love from the original and enhanced edition content while doubling down on artwork and mechanics that directly detail those stories, as if the players were reading them in the comics they allegedly come from. The new format not only streamlines game play but clarifies the game phases much more precisely and allows players to get a much better feel for how their characters interact. The new artwork is a perfect facsimile of comics from a multitude of time periods ranging from the Golden Age right up to the present, including many homages to the great artists of those periods.\"\n \u2014Zach Denoncour (Adjacent Hex Podcast), A.K.A. ALD_Zach\nIf you want to play non-Definitive Edition Sentinels of the Multiverse content alongside this new content, then you're in luck! We've got this handy Conversion Guide! Check it out by clicking the image below!\nHi, everybody! This is Paul Bender, CEO of Greater Than Games! I want to tell you a brief story about my personal experience with Sentinels of the Multiverse: Definitive Edition. \nBack in late 2019 and early 2020, Christopher and Adam had a series of discussions about their future vision for Sentinels of the Multiverse. The sweeping set of changes, tweaks, and improvements that you see in Definitive Edition grew out of those discussions, but for those first few months I wasn\u2019t really a part of that dialogue (I was busy with various\u2026. 2020 things. You were there; you know). \nAnyhow! Approximately one year ago, Christopher and Adam presented me with their vision of Sentinels of the Multiverse: Definitive Edition, and at first I was a bit skeptical that remaking the core game in the way they intended was the right way to go. However, they quickly convinced me. Looking at the new art that Adam was working on and playing through the new versions of familiar characters that Christopher was rewriting completely convinced me that Definitive Edition was both worth making and incredibly awesome. I realized at that point that the absolute best argument in favor of Definitive Edition is\u2026 Definitive Edition. I knew that some people would be skeptical, as I was, and I wanted them to have the same opportunity that I had to be convinced that Definitive Edition is really something that they want. Unfortunately, we can\u2019t afford to send Christopher to everyone\u2019s city with a pre-production copy of Definitive Edition, so we decided on the next best thing: The Sentinels of the Multiverse: Definitive Edition Kickstarter Money-Back Guarantee!\nWhat is \"The Sentinels of the Multiverse: Definitive Edition Kickstarter Money-Back Guarantee\"? Simply put, if you back this Kickstarter campaign, you can return your copy of Sentinels of the Multiverse: Definitive Edition within 90 days for a full refund (including shipping), no questions asked. We believe very strongly that playing Definitive Edition will convince you that you want Definitive Edition, and we are willing to put our money where our mouth is on this one. Here are some more details on how this will work:\nYou have 90 days to request a refund, starting on the date of our Kickstarter update announcing that fulfillment is complete (and reminding you that the refund clock is starting).\nWithin that window, if you would like a refund for this product, please email contact@greaterthangames.com \nWe will generate a shipping return label for you to print out. You will need to re-package your copy of Definitive Edition in its original packaging, affix the label, and drop it off at a FedEx facility. Your refund will be processed within 10-15 days of when the product arrives at our facility.\nIt is as simple as that! If you have any questions about this policy, definitely reach out to us and we\u2019ll get them answered (and post the answers to any FAQs on this page).\nThis is Paul Bender again with another Kickstarter Shipping Explanation! Here's the deal with shipping and customs: it is frustratingly expensive \u2014 even more so after the events of the last year or so \u2014 and there is no legal way around how frustratingly expensive it is. We've tried many different shipping methods in the past, and we've always lost money on international shipping, no matter what we do. Our plan for this Kickstarter campaign is to fulfill pledge levels for North American backers ourselves, and use Spiral Galaxy Games in the UK to fulfill pledges for all of our other backers.\nWe looked at the rates that we paid last year to fulfill the Spirit Island: Jagged Earth campaign and used them as the basis for shipping rates on this campaign, since Jagged Earth and Sentinels of the Multiverse: Definitive Edition are of a similar size and weight. We then slightly subsidized everyone's rates across the board. That means that we'll be spending some of your pledge dollars on shipping above and beyond what you pay for shipping; the amount that we're charging you for shipping definitely does NOT cover the entire cost of shipping. Just enough of it to make sure that we're not losing a ton of money to shipping, as has happened traditionally. It also means that 100% of the materials, packaging costs, and handling for shipments will have to come out of the actual pledges and not the amount we charge you for shipping.\nThese shipping charges do not include VAT or customs duties. Talking with our contacts in the shipping industry and looking at our experiences with past Kickstarters, it is still unclear exactly how we (and/or you as the customer) will be charged, especially in light of Brexit. Given that, it is our current plan to charge VAT to backers via BackerKit after the campaign ends (so that we can be sure to charge the correct amount even if the VAT rates change this year). We will also work to minimize customs clearance charges, but depending on how a particular country works (again, especially considering Brexit), customers outside the US or UK might wind up with some delivery charges. Based on our past experiences, this is fairly rare, but does happen. We wish we could offer more clarity on exactly how this will work, but global trade is in massive flux right now so it is impossible to know for certain what will happen. However, we'll post updates with any clarifying information about shipping and VAT charges, both during the campaign and after, if things solidify.\nBelow are the shipping charges for this campaign. The first number is the base shipping price for a pledge level. The second number is the additional shipping charge for each copy of an add-on.\nUS: $9 / $5\nCAN: $25 / $12\nZone A: $35 / $18\nZone B: $55 / $27\nOther: $69 / $39\nThe \"Zones\" you see here are based on zones that FedEx and other carriers use to price packages. We've cross-referenced these with our recent Spirit Island: Jagged Earth Kickstarter fulfillment and set the prices for each zone several dollars lower than the average amount we were charged to ship to that zone.\nZone A: Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Great Britain, Italy, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Spain, Switzerland, Ireland, Sweden\nZone B: Austria, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Finland, Gibraltar, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Israel, Malta, Mexico, Monaco, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Turkey\nFinally, there are unfortunately a few countries to which we cannot ship. We've attempted to ship to these countries in the past, only to have the vast majority of parcels lost or returned after very large shipping charges. There is no way to exclude countries from shipping on Kickstarter, so if you back the project from one of these countries, we will unfortunately have to refund you your pledge. We don't like it anymore than you do, but we have even less power than you do to change the laws of the country that you live in! \nForbidden Zone: Brazil, Cuba, North Korea, Russia, Syria, Venezuela, Yemen\nOverall, we are confident that this system of shipping is most fair and equitable to everyone, based on how much we'll be paying to ship out the rewards for this Kickstarter. If you feel the shipping costs associated with backing this Kickstarter are too high, we can only hope that they game does well enough to be available for purchase in a place closer to home for you.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is a bit of an unusual Kickstarter campaign for us, which introduces some new risks and challenges that we haven\u2019t encountered before. The first is that this is the first time we\u2019ve run a Kickstarter campaign for a new edition of a previously published game. Is this the right way to go about it? We think so, but it is impossible to know until we do it!\n\nSeparately, we also anticipate concern from some backers about the timeline of this project. In the past, we have run several Kickstarter projects that ran significantly behind schedule before delivering. Fortunately, we believe that we have a foolproof solution this time around! Sentinels of the Multiverse: Definitive Edition is already fully through the development, design, and layout process, and has in fact already begun pre-press work at the printer!

Sean Molley", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "SIN is the second full-length sourcebook for the Spire roleplaying game. You can learn more about Spire on our website.\n\nIn Spire - a mile-high city riddled with betrayal and inequality - the Ministry of Our Hidden Mistress fights with dagger and shadow against the cruel High Elf overlords, waging a hidden war of sabotage, insurrection and assassination. \nSin focuses on three main elements of the city of Spire:\nCriminal enterprise is big business everywhere in the city, but particularly in the lawless knot subterranean of violence known as Red Row and among the feuding public house Knights of the North Docks. We go into great detail on the different families and \"noble\" knightly houses, take a look at the gods and goddesses of illegal endeavours, and shine light on the unfathomably callous high elf murder mystery parties (containing real murder).\nThe Spiral Council does what they can to uphold a corrupt peace in Spire, but even with a network of guards, militias, undercover operatives and a fully-mobilised army at their command they still struggle. Learn more about the Paladins hunting the Ministry, visit the nightmarish environs of Spire's most dangerous and most secure prison, and infiltrate the ranks of the Allied Defence Force to steal experimental aelfir technology.\nWith the arrival of the sun-worshipping high elves, much of the religion practiced by the drow inhabitants of Spire was driven underground centuries ago; now, it has twisted itself into something bitter and vengeful as a result. We explore the triparite Damnic faith (the Cathedral of Our Glorious Lady, the Ministry of Our Hidden Mistress, and the vicious Crimson Vigil) as well as looking into the Old Faiths of the Home Nations and the endless parades and rituals of the Solar Pantheon.\nAll of these sections are backed up with character options, equipment advances and NPCs that allow both players and GMs to use the content provided as easily as possible at the table. \nBut that's not all! We've also got:\nTwo New Classes\nLie to gods for a living as the Gutter Cleric\nThe Gutter Cleric is an experimental field theologian who hacks together magic from forbidden, dead or merely unpopular gods into unusual effects (in fact, two of their Medium Advances are almost entirely redacted); the Mortician Executioner is the sharp end of a great and powerful administrative organisation devoted to declaring luckless individuals legally dead and then correcting the oversight at swordpoint. \nRead people their rites as the Mortician Executioner.\nAnd: Three New Full-Length Adventures\n The Hand of the Gods sees the Ministers pitched into the middle of a war between three cults all fighting over the same holy relic - the hand of a saint who is connected to one, all, or none of the organisations in the conflict. How can they exploit the situation to their advantage?\nIn Second-Hand Rain, a demonic eidolon appears in the city of Spire and bring with it the noir  atmosphere of an hard-boiled interbellum crime fiction thriller. The eidolon can bring down empires in the wrong hands; do those hands belong to the player characters?\nAlthough the aelfir have been unable to summon their gods to Spire, The Birth of Brother Harvest unites the Autumn Church and the Midwives as they grow a wretched, deformed murder god in an upspire hatchery. What does it take to kill a god, and do the Ministers even want to? \nA Revolutionary's Guide to Spire\nIn addition to all that, we're continuing the tradition of our newspaper clippings and The Spiral Muse to bring you The Revolutionary's Guide to Spire, a zine created by the writers of Liberate! (voted Spire's Most Illegal Publication three years running). Discretely released on a quarterly basis, TRGS has the unbiased low-down on all the coolest nightlife spots, where to buy a revolver without getting robbed and/or killed, up-to-date codephrases and ciphers and how best to escape from the City Guard. Rumors that the TRGS is secretly funded by radical aelfir elements looking to promote their own businesses and badmouth their rivals are not to be entertained.\nThe Revolutionary's Guide To Spire is a companion zine for Spire, filled with in-character adventure hooks, NPCs, setting info and tidbits for you and your players to enjoy. You can add it to your rewards by choosing the Revolutionary Hardback tier.\nWe're offering flat rate shipping for the Kickstarter only. You'll be able to combine your pledge with our other products in Backerkit later on, and we'll do our best to keep shipping costs as low as possible. Our books will ship either from the UK or the US, and we aim to offer EU-friendly shipping with duties paid.\nEndorsements\n\u201cSpire\u2019s a mix of narrative freedom and wired and weird narrative detail, its ideas thrusting up from the landscape of fantasy game, visible to miles around. Even my hatred of Elves can\u2019t lower my admiration\u201d - Kieron Gillen (the Wicked + the Divine)\n\n\u201cHowitt and Taylor lovingly built Spire out of compelling plot hooks that will motivate any group of players to chase the satisfaction of smashing it into glistening pieces... a smart balance of well built action and socio-political commentary.\u201d - James D'Amato (The One Shot network)\n\n\u201cSpire has one of the most intriguing settings of any game I\u2019ve come across, backed with elegant and simple mechanics. It\u2019s a fascinating RPG experience.\u201d Adrian Tchaikovsky (Shadows of the Apt, Arthur C. Clarke Award winner)\n\n\u201cThis is an edifice of urban fantasy with the electricity of Mi\u00e9ville at his best, and the pressure-cooker claustrophobia of Blades in the Dark. It\u2019s bombastic, sexy, downright political stuff which rises up from foundations in the deepest strata of Gigaxic kitsch into the thin air of pure invention.\u201d Nate Crowley (The Death and Life of Schneider Wrack, The Sea Hates a Coward)\n\n\u201cGrant and the Spire team have answered one of the oldest questions in fantasy: how to do something different with dark elves. Their answer is Spire, a police procedural in Hell, a baroque conspiracy thriller and a heroic tragedy all wrapped up in two mile high feral walls and urban chaos.\u201d Alasdair Stuart (The Doctor Who Roleplaying Game)\nAdd-Ons\nWe're going to handle add-ons post Kickstarter via Backerkit; you'll be able to add any of the other books we produce onto your order to save on postage, and they'll all be delivered alongside delivery of Sin. \nThe Team\nVeteran Spire authors Grant Howitt and Christopher Taylor have returned and put together a team of new and established authors to write Sin. For those of you familiar with Spire, you'll be pleased to welcome back Chris Farnell, Pauline Chan, Basheer Ghouse, JP Bradley and Helen Gould - and we're happy to add Cat Evans, Eleanor Hingley, Cleo Keahna, Thomas Manuel, N MasYk and Viditya Voleti to the growing list of people who've helped us create this  world.\n\nSome of these writers have years of experience in the field; for others, this is their first full-length commission. Over the last few years we've been hand-selecting a suite of writers who, regardless of their prior work, get Spire in a way that we recognise - and can communicate it well with the reader.  We're so excited to work with them and take the world in directions that, alone, we never could have taken it whilst staying true to the high standards of writing that we've set ourselves.\n\nAdrian Stone is returning with full-page, full-colour art (as you can see throughout this Kickstarter) and Rowan Rook & Decard's first actual employee, Mina McJanda, is handling the graphic design and layout.\n\n\nAll stretch goals will be made available to all backers at PDF level or above in digital format.

RED ROW MANSION MAP. An in-detail map of Destera House, a crumbling mansion (complete with palatial, if decrepit grounds) on the outskirts of Red Row - filled with secret passages, NPCs to charm and betray, opulent decor to pawn off once you've pried it out with a crowbar, and presumably some kind of fancy party to sneak into.

Founded by Grant Howitt, Chris Taylor and Mary Hamilton in 2017, we've recently brought on Mina McJanda as our first full-time employee.

Although we had some problems getting books from them to us thanks to Brexit, we've set up a stable import connection so it hopefully won't cause us problems in future.\n\nWe will be working with Parcelhub for fulfillment (who we have worked with successfully for the previous 5 Kickstarters); Studio 2 Publishing will handle our US and Canadian orders; we are hoping to work with Kixto to ensure that European orders can be fulfilled with no additional post-Brexit costs. Rules around shipping to the EU will change in July this year; given that we're hoping to deliver late in the year, we'll have plenty of time to create an efficient solution for postage. We're also allocating a larger shipping and delivery contingency budget than ever before on this project after our experiences with Heart taught us that a pandemic can really mess with postage times and costs. \n\nThe previous 12 months have been unlike any other we've experienced in our lives, and they've presented unprecedented challenges with regards to - well - everything. We don't know what will happen over the duration of this project with regards to the wider world, infectious diseases, supply chain disruptions and Britain's increasingly strained relationship with its neighbours, but we promise that we'll remain transparent and tell you what we know, when we know it, so you can stay up to date.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nLong-lasting design\nOur books are printed to the highest standards and built to last.

Sean Molley", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Black Box\nThe Black Box is a brand new expansion for Catacombs 3E. It features a new double-sided playmat featuring the Athenoch Mortuary on one side and the Notholag Dungeon on the other. \nIt provides a full set of alternate monsters cards for the base Catacombs game plus every expansion published so far including: Cavern of Soloth, Ice Box, Keystones & Keeps, Resurrection Packs 1 & 2, and Wyverns of Wylemuir. \nThere is a new set of monsters for the Vermin family and the new Mushroom familiar for the heroes. The expansion provides room cards featuring these new Vermin monsters and the Burial Chamber special room card.\nIn terms of rules, this expansion introduces the snowball ranged shot, group rush shot,  move to rune \"shot\" and the transmogrify shot modifier. \nThe box artwork  is an homage to the cover of Catacombs First Edition, first released over ten years ago.\nStretch Goals\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpgrade Levels\n\nReward Levels\nAdd-ons\nVideos\nCatacombs Third Edition (Catacombs 3E)\nCatacombs is a dexterity based, one vs many dexterity dungeon crawl.  Four heroes are selected to protect the town of Stormtryne by battling  their way through countless enemies before finally facing the dreaded  Catacomb Lord.\n\nEach hero has their own unique set of actions, abilities, items or  spells that aid them through the various rooms and encounters.\nThe Overseer player controls the monsters and the Catacomb Lord, acting as the adversary the heroes aim to defeat.\nThere is a near limitless combination of rooms to explore. Some rooms  have a swarm of monsters that the heroes must fight through to succeed.  Others provide unique encounters where the heroes can spend their hard  earned gold on new items, healing services, or even gamble to gain every  edge they can against the Overseer player.\nThe actions a character may take are determined by the rules provided  on their cards in the form of shot sequences. Each shot does something  different. Some do varying amounts of damage, while others can freeze  opponents, scare them off, or teleport allies out of danger, to name a  few. There are dozens of shots in Catacombs.\nJust using a shot doesn't always guarantee its action, however. In  order to be effective, players will have to train their dexterity skills  and accurately flick wooden discs. Ducking in and out of cover,  positioning shots, and banking attacks off obstacles are essential  skills to an experienced player.\nIf the heroes live long enough to breach the Catacomb Lord's Lair,  they will meet their final test - battling the Catacomb Lord them self!\n\n\nFAQ\nQuestion: What are the main rule changes to Catacombs & Castles 2E (second edition)?\nAll heroes in the base Catacombs & Castles 2E game now have a native ability on their hero rules cards. As a result, heroes from the base game only use one ability card.\nCatacombs & Castles 2E hero portrait and rules cards are included for the King's Champion, Royal Archer, Wraith Knight, and Shaman increasing the roster of heroes in the base game from 8 to 12.\nThe base shot sequences for all 8 of the original heroes included in Catacombs & Castles 1E were updated.\nThe rules for ability cards were harmonized between Team Mode and Boss Mode. In summary, ability cards are always charged up.\nThe placement of the obstacles during game setup was simplified.\nThe shield shot rules in Catacombs & Castles 2E were harmonized with those from Catacombs 3E.\nThe longbow shot rules in Catacombs & Castles 2E were harmonized with those from Catacombs Conquest.\nThe shuriken shot has an additional effect.\nThe rules for the net and web shots were changed - they no longer trap players and prevent them from taking an action.\nThe same hero cannot damage the same opposing character consecutively during a shot sequence.\nThe horn team action permits only one teammate to perform a shot sequence.\nThe orange ice shot icon was replaced with the ice boulder shot icon.\nThe orange target ice shot icon was replaced with a blue target ice shot icon.\nThe target ice shot and ice boulder shots enable assist transfers.\nThe fireball and giant fireball shots enable void transfers.\nThe term grapple shot now refers both to the original grapple shot and the claw shot.\nExplanations of the the runic shift, move to rune, hook, and lightning shots were added to the Castles 2E core rules.\nThe Castle Lord's starting Armour was increased to 3.\nThe Wraith Knight's starting Health was increased to 12.\nQuestion: Do the playmats have stitched edges?\nNo, as these interfere with game play.\nQuestion: Will the \"Big Box\" versions of Catacombs & Castles 2E and Catacombs 3E be available at retail?\nNo. They will only be available now during this campaign and later from our online shop.\nQuestion: What are the main changes to the second edition of the Wyverns of Wylemuir expansion?\nThere are additional cards for both Castles 2E and Catacombs 3E compatibility. The game board has replaced by a 3E sized, double-sided playmat.\nQuestion: What if I already own the Wyverns playmat but don't have the Wyverns expansion?\nThe Wyverns components without the box or playmat will be available directly in the Elzra Pledge Manager after the campaign ends.\nQuestion: What about \"group buys\"?\nPlease contact us by submitting a business inquiry ticket.\nQuestion: What time zone are you located in?\nEastern Standard.\nQuestion: What is the best way to contact you?\nThe best way is by submitting a support ticket via our website. This opens a ticket in our system to ensure we don't miss it. As always, we are a small team and it may take some time to reply.\nPledge Manager\nSales Tax & VAT\nCanada\nPrices expressed in pledge / reward levels for backers in Canada are in Canadian dollars and are exclusive of GST / HST.\nWe must charge applicable GST/HST to all orders from backers within Canada. This is a legal requirement to ensure our company's compliance with both the law and with the Canada Revenue Agency's rules.\nUK and European Union\nThere are significant regulatory changes in the UK and European Union that will affect all Kickstarter campaigns. These are BREXIT, Import Control System (ICS2) and the VAT De Minimis Removal.\n BREXIT (January 2021): Will require Customs Declarations for EU-GB-EU shipments. Affects shipments from the European Union to Great Britain, and from Great Britain to the European Union \n Import Control System (ICS2) (March 2021): The enhancement of the security screening program will require that certain shipment data elements be sent to the EU Customs authorities for review and approval prior to loading at the country of export. Affects shipments from everywhere in the world to (or transiting) the European Union, Norway or Switzerland \n VAT De Minimis Removal (July 2021): The abolition of the 22 Euros VAT De Minimis for imports into the EU will result in formal Customs clearance for all inbound EU shipments and the levying of VAT. Affects shipments from everywhere in the world to the European Union \nWith these changes, Customs authorities are further enforcing the regulatory requirements related to the provision of complete and accurate customs data in order to optimize security and safety screening, as well as combat counterfeiting and piracy, prevent unfair competition and ensure full collection of duties and taxes.\nUK\nPrices expressed in pledge / reward levels for backers in the UK should be considered exclusive of VAT.\nVAT on your selected reward level will be collected during the Elzra Pledge Manager. VAT will also be collected on the cost of shipping.\nOne of the main changes that will affect customers from 1st January 2021 is the change to the deemed place of supply of goods. As things stand now, goods are subject to VAT in the country in which they are located at the point of sale.\nThe government is proposing that from 1st January 2021, a Business to Consumer sale of goods to a UK consumer will be deemed to take place in the UK, even if the goods were located outside the UK at the point of sale. \nRead more here.\nEuropean Union\nFor an overview of the current VAT system in the European Union, please see this article (europa.eu).\nThere are significant regulatory changes scheduled to come into effect on the 1st of July, 2021. \nThe official memo from the European Union regarding these changes can be read online here:\nModernising VAT for e-commerce (europa.eu)\nWith regards to this campaign, prices expressed in pledge / reward levels for backers in the European Union should be considered exclusive of VAT. \nRead more here.\nShipping\nYou will be charged shipping after the Kickstarter campaign ends based on the actual costs incurred to ship your package to you. We will collect these charges via the Elzra Pledge Manager after this Kickstarter campaign.\nVolumetric Weight\nThe shipping box for the \"Big Box\" version of Catacombs & Castles 2E + stretch goals is expected to be 16x16x8\" / 40.64 x 40.64 x 20.32 cm (15 lbs / 6.8 kg volumetric weight). \nThe dimensions of the shipping box directly affects the price of shipping as carriers now charge the higher cost of either the package's weight or volume (otherwise called volumetric weight). Here is a link to DHL's volumetric weight calculator as an example.\nPlease watch this video that explains further the concept of volumetric weight:\nUK\nFor confirmed backers in the UK, Games Quest will ship from within the UK. This should prevent any additional customs or handling charges. All shipments within the UK will support tracking data. VAT must be calculated on the cost of shipping the package in addition to the price of the game itself.\nEurope\nFor confirmed backers in the European Union, Games Quest is expected to ship DPP (delivered, duty paid) from their UK hub. This should prevent any additional customs or handling charges. \nSwitzerland, Norway, Iceland, Ukraine\nFor confirmed backers in Switzerland, Norway, Iceland, and Ukraine, Games Quest is expected to ship from their UK hub.\nCanada\nFor confirmed backers in Canada, we will ship from our Elzra warehouse from Ontario, Canada. Please note that it is more expensive to ship packages to some parts of Canada than it is to ship a package to the other side of the planet. Those backers residing in the North outside of Whitehorse and Yellowknife should expect a significant delivery charge. All shipments in Canada will support tracking data. Backers based in Ontario will be able to choose local pick-up in the Elzra Pledge Manager. Our office is in Hamilton (Dundas).\nUSA\nFor confirmed backers in the USA including Alaska and Hawaii, we expect to ship from Canada. We may use a third party fulfillment company depending on the final order volume.\nFor those backers in the USA that must use a PO Box for their shipping address, your order must be processed separately and will be sent via Canada Post / USPS. DHL and UPS cannot ship to US PO Boxes. All shipments to the USA will support tracking data.\nMexico\nFor confirmed backers in Canada, we will ship from our Elzra warehouse from Ontario, Canada via Canada Post.\nIsrael\nFor confirmed backers in Israel, we will either ship from Canada, the UK or Germany. The total number of backers based in Israel will determine how best to proceed. DHL Express service to Israel is reliable but expensive.\nChina\nFor confirmed backers based in China and Hong Kong, VFI will ship from within China.\nAsia Pacific\nFor confirmed backers based in Australia, Japan, Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam, VFI will ship from China to their local hubs in those countries.\nImportant: If there is a significant number of backers from Australia, then fulfillment will occur from within that country using Aetherworks and shipping costs will be re-calculated. Shipping costs to Western Australia, Tasmania, South Australia, and the Northern Territory can be significant.\nRest of World\nFor confirmed backers in India, the Middle East, South Africa, and South America, we expect to ship from either VFI's hub in China or from Canada using Canada Post's slow, but reliable, international parcel surface service.\nImportant Shipping Related Information\nInternational PO Boxes\nWe simply cannot ship to international PO boxes.\nShipping After the Deadline to Confirm Your Pledge\nIf you do not confirm your pledge after the deadline for confirming your shipping details via the Elzra Pledge Manager, your rewards will  be shipped to you from the Elzra warehouse in Canada. As such, shipping costs may be considerably higher for those outside of Canada and the USA.\nDelivery Attempts and Package Delivery Bounces\nWe will make attempt to deliver your package based on the shipping address and contact information you supply in the Elzra Pledge Manager.\nIf your package is returned (bounces) during fulfillment, we will conduct an investigation as to what happened. When the fault is ours, we will pay to re-ship the package.\nHowever, if it is determined that the package was returned due to an error in the shipping information provided to us, you will have to pay to have the package shipped out again.\nThe moral of the story is: help us help you by taking a few extra minutes to double-check your shipping address in the Elzra Pledge Manager and ensure it is correct.\nChanging Your Shipping Address\nIf you need to change your shipping address before we have delivered your package, please open a support ticket. See the Support section of this campaign page.\n Pay Attention to Tracking Emails During Delivery\nWhen the shipping method we use to deliver your package supports tracking, you are responsible for following the tracking data closely and to secure the package immediately upon delivery to minimize the potential of package theft.\nCanada Post, DHL, and UPS support redirecting shipments to a safe pick-up location later.\nShipping Addresses for Backers in China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan\nTo increase the reliability of their delivery, backers in China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan may submit their shipping address (but not their billing address) using Chinese characters in the Elzra Pledge Manager.\nPackaging\nWe spend a lot of effort and extra money to pack your games carefully. We use strong, double-walled shipping boxes, the best protective void fill, and leave extra space between the walls of the shipping box and its contents. If the shipping box suffers from damage which affects its contents, we reserve the right to determine next steps to resolve the issue. Backers frequently request empty replacement game boxes, but the factory doesn't produce these and sending them out to fulfillment centers when they may not be required is a waste of the campaign's resources. Please open a support ticket to report the issue to us and we will proceed from there. See the Support section of this campaign page.\nShipping Rates\n Shipping Rates\nThe following shipping rates assume the following:\n15 lb / 6.8 kg volumetric weight\n16 x 16 x 8\" / 40.64 x 40.64 x 20.32 cm double-walled shipping box\nUnited States\nLower 48 states plus Alaska and Hawaii - $28 USD\nCanada\nCanada - Alberta - Calgary - $29 CAD\nCanada - BC - $32 CAD\nCanada - Manitoba - $27 CAD\nCanada - Ontario - $19 CAD\nCanada - New Brunswick - $33 CAD\nCanada - Nova Scotia - $25 CAD\nCanada - Nova Scotia - rural - $49 CAD\nCanada - Quebec - Quebec - $19 CAD\nCanada - Saskatchewan - $30 CAD\nCanada - Yukon - $25 CAD (Canada Post)\nNorthwest Territories, Nunavut, or Yukon: approx. $150 CAD (expensive!)\nMexico\n$79 USD (Canada Post tracked surface service)\nUK\n\u00a310\nEuropean Union\nAustria - \u20ac17\nBelgium - \u20ac16\nBulgaria - \u20ac39\nCroatia - PENDING\nCzechia - \u20ac24\nDenmark - \u20ac24\nEstonia - \u20ac33\nFinland - \u20ac21\nFrance - \u20ac21\nGermany - \u20ac16\nGreece - \u20ac39\nHungary - \u20ac24\nIreland - \u20ac21\nItaly - \u20ac24\nLatvia - \u20ac33\nLithuania - \u20ac39\nLuxembourg - \u20ac21\nNetherlands - \u20ac21\nPoland - \u20ac21\nPortugal - \u20ac33\nRomania - \u20ac39\nSlovakia - \u20ac24\nSlovenia - \u20ac21\nSpain - \u20ac38\nSweden - \u20ac21\nNorway, Switzerland, Iceland, Ukraine\nNorway - \u20ac22\nSwitzerland - \u20ac23\nIsrael\n$45 USD (Asia zone 2)\nChina, Hong Kong\n$11 USD (Asia zone 0 - shipping from China)\nAsia Pacific\nAustralia - $25 USD (Asia zone 1, ships from hub inside country)\nIndonesia - $45 (Asia zone 2)\nJapan - $25 USD (Asia zone 1)\nMalaysia - $25 USD (Asia zone 1)\nPhilippines - $25 USD (Asia zone 1)\nSingapore - $25 USD (Asia zone 1)\nNew Zealand - $45 (Asia zone 2)\nSouth Korea - $25 USD (Asia zone 1)\nTaiwan $25 - USD (Asia zone 1)\nThailand $25 - USD (Asia zone 1)\nVietnam $25 - USD (Asia zone 1)\nRest of World\nBahrain - $45 USD (Asia zone 2)\nKuwait - $45 USD (Asia zone 2)\nSaudi Arabia - $45 USD (Asia zone 2)\nUnited Arab Emiraes - $45 USD (Asia zone 2)\nSouth Africa - $25 USD (Asia zone 1)\n\nSupport\n\nFor customer support, please submit a support ticket by clicking the icon below:\nClick Here to Ask a Question\nKickstarter Private Messaging for Support\nBackers who contact us via Kickstarter's private messaging system will be directed to submit a support ticket. Kickstarter messaging has very limited capabilities and it is not efficient for us to use.\nKickstarter Comment Page for Support\nPlease note also that we cannot respond to specific customer support requests on the comments page of this project. We take pride in our excellent customer service, and aim to deal with  requests as quickly and efficiently as possible when using channels that we have setup for this purpose. Note that sometimes we will receive a  significant volume of requests, so please be patient while we work through them.\nFollow us on Twitter and Instagram for announcements and behind the scenes photos.\nTerms\nRefunds\nRefunds may be given within 30 days of the campaign ending, including fees. After this time, refunds may be given minus the Kickstarter and payment processing fees due to us not being able to claim them back after 30 days.\nWe are unable to issue refunds once we have confirmed quantities and/or started production and/or if we have begun the packaging and shipment stages of the project.\nAbandoned Pledges\nIf you do not confirm your shipping and pledge details in the Elzra Pledge Manager within ten weeks of our notification via email, we will consider it abandoned. The funds from your pledge will be considered a donation to this campaign.\nYour Responsibilities\nBy pledging for this Kickstarter campaign, you agree that our responsibility to you is for shipping your reward as confirmed in the Elzra Pledge Manager. \nYou are responsible for import taxes, sales taxes or other fees that may be payable to relevant tax authorities. \nYou accept that you are fully liable for incorrect shipping details and will risk your pledge being unable to be delivered or lost in transit. \nYou acknowledge that you will pay attention to your package's tracking status and arrange to have your package taken to a safe place upon delivery to prevent package theft.\nYou acknowledge that the final look and contents of your reward may be different from what is presented at the start of the campaign.\nOur Projects (Past Projects)\nComing Attractions (Upcoming Games)\nClick Me\nClick Me", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs this is a new edition of an existing game, much of the initial artwork and development of Catacombs & Castles 2E has already been completed. We have been working on the second edition for over a year.\n\nWe are planning to use the same factory that produced Catacombs Cubes. We have met with the owner of this factory and our account manager in person several times. \n\nWe are using the same factory that produces all of our high quality playmats.\n\nWe are planning to use the same fulfillment partners we have worked with in the past: Games Quest, VFI, and Aetherworks (assuming a sufficient number of orders from Australia). We have met the owners of all of these companies in person. They have been transparent about delays related to the COVID-19 pandemic when they have been forced to halt or slow operations.\n\nFor our domestic and US fulfillment operation, we are using the same suppliers for cardboard cartons and packaging.\n\nWe are fully aware of potential delays that may happen with products that are produced overseas: printer production schedules, major holidays (Lunar New Year, National Week), shipping, and customs delays. We will work diligently to minimize these types of disruptions and promise to communicate transparently with our backers if they occur.\n\nWe have estimated delivery for January 2022. Due to the global logistics involved in shipping, some regions may receive their rewards sooner than others.\n\nWe are factoring in ocean shipping and fulfillment delays as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge CA$ 1 or more", "title": "Supporter Pledge", "descp": "Support the campaign and receive project updates.

And, well, it is. Especially since the Crystals that you seek happen to be inside giant space Beasts. To mine them, you need to, well, be eaten.\nShould you achieve your objective and mine enough Crystals to meet your quota, it is then cost-effective for the company to activate your jetpack and extricate you from the proverbial belly of the Beast.\nIn the event that the Bacteria present in the Beast overwhelm you and you are digested, do not despair. Your non-organic parts will certainly be useful in the mining exploits of future Miners. In fact, you may encounter some such pieces of equipment in your expedition, remains of less-than-qualified recruits from past attempts.\nFinally, it could transpire that you do not collect the necessary Crystals by the time you reach the end of your adventure, without the Beast having digested you.\nIn this case, you will then exit the Beast from the other end than the one you entered. Alive... and yet forever changed. In this case we will have to evaluate your performance against that of the Beast\u2019s efforts to consume you.\nIn So, You've Been Eaten. the Miner and the Beast will face off against one another. \nThe Miner earns points by collecting Crystals and the Beast earns points by developing Immune Responses and by its Bacteria attacking the Miner.\nThe game ends in a win for the Miner if they collect all 8 different Crystals, and the Beast wins by digesting the Miner after four Bacteria of the same type have attacked.\nOf course, there\u2019s always the possibility that the Miner will simply pass through the Beast\u2019s system, and then the player with the most points wins!\n So, You\u2019ve Been Eaten. can be played as:\nA game for 2 players, with a Miner player against a Beast player.\nA game for 1 player, with the Miner player against a Hibernating Beast.\nA game for 1 player, with the Beast player against a robot Miner.\nA game for 0 players, with a Hibernating Beast against a robot Miner.\n\nWant the all-in-fire-and-forget pledge?\nThe hyper-high-end one with triple-layered(!) boards?\nThe lovingly deluxified KS-limited objet d'art for your shelf?\nThe one with the bursting-with-bits-even-though-it's-even-bigger-box?\nChoose the Collector Edition pledge level, and rejoice!\nAnd if you have not yet decided to back now, here's why you should:\n- Discounted shipping! Post-campaign shipping costs will be higher.\n- Guaranteed availability of the Collector edition! Due to its bigger, special box, we will likely not be producing this as easily as the retail edition, and due to its heavier weight, this is not going to be easy to ship when not doing mass KS fulfillment.\n- Loyalty discount! Get $1 per previous LudiCreations campaign backed - see below for more details.\n- Don't miss a game full of unconventional asymmetric gameplay by Scott Almes & striking art by Kwanchai Moriya!\nPremium Edition - savings\nThe custom-shaped double-printed acrylic Crystal tokens and the printed wooden Bacteria tokens are going to be available as a $9 add-on, and the Dyspepto-Beastmol mini-expansion will be available as a $5 add-on. By backing the Premium edition, you would get a $4 discount, and also receive the custom-cut Replication token (the \"Miner meeple\"), which we do not expect to later sell separately.\n\nCollector Edition - LudiCreations Loyalty Discount\nBackers of the Collector Edition will receive a discount of $1 per previous LudiCreations campaign they have backed in the past, up to a maximum of $5 off. This will be applied in Backerkit and can be used for reducing the cost of shipping and add-ons. For more information, please see the FAQs.\n\nTuckboxes - Sleeves?\nYes, they fit. We tested with premium sleeves.\nRemember kids, always use protection!\nSo, You've Been Eaten. is an asymmetric game. Players must balance short-term benefit against trying to gain an advantage for the next turns. Many times they will need to simply survive the turn. To win, they need to make clever plays and try to corner their opponent into having to make increasingly difficult choices.\nThe Miner is playing a dice manipulation & placement game to try to eliminate Bacteria and capture Crystals (and Tools) that are present on a row of cards between them and the Beast player.\nThe Beast is playing a hand management and drafting game, to try to position their Bacteria to attack the Miner, and acquire Immune Response cards that can make the Miner player's life difficult.\nThe 2p game\nThe Miner begins, and rolls their dice. They then take an action with each one of those dice, removing Stomach cards from the digestive tract between the players, and at the end of their turn, whatever Bacteria is closest to them attacks!\nThe Beast then strategically refills the tract to cause the Miner the most difficulty, then may develop an Immune Response, refills their hand, and plays a Mutation card against the Miner, trying to match the Bacteria on it with the one that might attack the Miner at the end of their turn!\nIf the Miner collects 8 Crystals, they win outright. If one of the Beast's Bacteria tracks reaches the 4th level, the Beast wins immediately. If the deck of Stomach card runs out, points are counted, and whoever player has the most is the winner!\n\nThe 1p game\nSo, You've Been eaten. can be played as a solo game, either as the Miner (against a Hibernating Beast), or as the Beast (against a Robot Miner).\nAll actions remain the same. What changes is how their effects are triggered.\n\nThe 0p game\nNope, 0 players does not mean that the game will set up and play itself. And no, it probably does not count as a play if you decide to not play it. Yes, it does seem to fit the times we are now living in.\nHowever you look at it, having the two AIs play each other is possible, and a conversation starter for the non-board-game-geeks wandering near your shelf.\nYou can download the rules of So, You've Been Eaten. here.\nYou can download the rules of So, You've Been Eaten.: Dyspepto-Beastmol here.\nPlease download these files, as PDFs viewed in-browser may not be displayed properly.

Should a package not arrive within a certain time frame that will be announced when it has been shipped, we will spend a period of time investigating its fate before any action is taken.\nCertain countries do not appear on the list of available shipping destinations. This is due to past experiences and potential cost overruns due to weight fluctuations. Click the pledge level and please contact us via KS message if your country does not appear on the list. Regrettably, shipping to CIS and Brazil will not be possible. \n We will be using Backerkit as our post-campaign fulfillment suite and pre-order management platform, through which shipping costs may be paid and additional copies may be obtained.\nBackerkit carts will be locked and credit cards will be charged shortly before fulfillment commences. There will be backer updates that inform about all deadlines.\n\nCosts\nThe real cost of shipping is subsidized and is offered for backers who pledge during the campaign being live. Post-campaign pre-order will likely be paying higher fees.\nShipping fees include costs like ocean freight, import fees and/or VAT, packing materials, labor, replacements shipping; and the risk of shipping cost increases. Those can add anything from $3 to $10 to the price you would have to pay if we did not subsidize them.\nThe shipping costs per copy are as follows, and include tracking:\nBasic edition: USA - $9 / EU - $9 / Everywhere else - $14\nPremium edition: USA - $9 / EU - $9 / Everywhere else - $14\nCollector edition: USA - $9 / EU - $14 / Everywhere else - $19\nUnfortunately backers in the UK, Switzerland, Norway and Canada do not fall in the EU and USA cost categories.\nThe USA cost category includes the \"lower 48\" states, and does not include Alaska, Hawaii, Guam & Puerto Rico. For these and for any other outlying territories, the \"everywhere else\" category applies. Please ask if in doubt.\nBackers (even $1 backers completing their pledge in Backerkit) will get the game with the discounted shipping costs outlined here. The cost will likely increase for post-campaign pre-orders. \nThe real costs that we have to pay are at least $12 for the USA, and $15 in the EU and worldwide - and that is not counting ocean freight and customs costs for us.\nIMPORTANT: Do not add these costs to your pledge! We will collect the shipping cost after the campaign, via Backerkit.\nRegrettably, we can not offer pickup at Spiel in Essen or any other convention.\n\nCOVID-19 Impact\nFulfillment providers worldwide are reporting that significant disruptions in deliveries persist in parts of the world. In practical terms this means that shipments to individual countries may be subject to delays.\nWe have taken what we now (March 2021) know into account when determining our production, logistics and fulfillment plans. However, it may happen that we may deviate from the schedule, and as noted in the Risks section, other backers may receive their rewards a lot earlier than you.\nWhen we have specific new information, we will reach out to backers, either via a backer update or individually, as the situation develops. In any case, please be prepared for delays, both in freight (before your reward is shipped), and after individual fulfillment has commenced. \n Retailers who wish to back this campaign must back at the $1 pledge level, and then contact us via the KS messaging system: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ludicreations/so-youve-been-eaten/messages/new?message%5Bto%5D=ludicreations\nThis offer is available to retailers who have a physical store in the countries allowed by the $1 pledge level. All entities and locations will be verified.\nRetailers within North America may also order from our distribution service provider Hit Point Sales, if signed up with an account. This would likely result in lower shipping costs (e.g. if ordering other games at the same time).\nOnline-only retailers will be considered in territories where no physical retailers have backed the campaign.\n\nFulfillment will be conducted in the following steps:\n1. Individual backers\n2. Physical stores\n3. Online-only stores (if any) - at least 2 weeks after the previous step\n\nThere will be a limit on how many copies of each edition that a retailer can order. A deposit will be taken during the campaign, with the rest of the funds payable via Backerkit.\nOnly retailers who back this campaign will be able to re-order any editions normally available only on Kickstarter, subject to availability.\n\nPlease contact us for more information.\nWhat You See Is What You Get - we like to run simple, straightforward campaigns. We are aware that stretch goals would increase the funding total. However, we have already thrown everything into this game - a lot of time, effort, and money. We are already going to print with the highest quality materials.\nWe also want to offer the game at the cheapest cost possible - and that is incompatible with stretch goals. We'd have to add \"hidden\" profit in the pledge levels that we can then \"spend\" to give you stretch goals - nothing is for free. Raising money beyond our goal does not give us extra money on hand to create stretch goals.\nRetail availability: The game will be available through retailers that back the campaign and want the Collector edition. We hope to eventually send a version of the game to distribution.\nGame design: Scott Almes\nIllustration: Kwanchai Moriya\nGraphic design: Viktor Csete\nProject management: Dimitris \"JamesH\" Chatzidimitriou\nRulebook editing: Paul \"GamingRules\" Grogan\nSpecial thanks: Alvin Chen, David Turczi, Philipp K\u00fchnl, Paulo Renato, Sonja Hatanp\u00e4\u00e4, Toni Heinonen, Angela Viveen, Adam Singer, David \"Dam\" Amorin Garc\u00eda, and all those brave space miners who helped us develop this completely fictional game that is definitely not from a dystopian future.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAll previous campaigns have been fulfilled, except \"Mr. Cabbagehead's Garden returns!\". Its production is initiated, and the project is on track to be completed on time. We are working with a manufacturer we have worked with before, and we are confident in our ability to deliver the game and any additional materials. That said, unforeseen events may affect how quickly fulfillment is conducted, and the final colors, graphics and components that you see presented here are subject to (however improbable) change. We are working with retailers and due to that and the realities of international logistics, it is very likely that some backers or other people may have the game in hand before you do. Note that our goal is to ship the game on time, by the dates listed on the pledge levels. Shipping a package is different than delivering a package. We do not deliver your game, the shipping company does. Therefore, delivery times will vary according to your local postal services \u2013 once we ship, the shipment is the responsibility of the shipping company.

All music, sound, and art assets have been created, leaving just the final few chapters to be written and edited by our in-house team. We need your support to finance the production of a physical book printing.\n\nWe've made our 40-page Adventure Preview available to everyone to get an early look into the world of Aetherra and its characters. Download it now.\nFano. Once a magnificent city upon the lake. Now a run-down sanctum for the destitute and the depraved. A quest to seek out a lost druid brings promise to restore the city to its former glory and awaken the ancient technology built within. Could Fano's awakening bring peace and prosperity once more, or will it unearth a conspiracy lurking in the shadows?\nThe Island City of Fano\n Aetherra is a fantastical world bound together by a raw elemental energy known as aether. A substance so profound that, when controlled, can power great cities with otherworldly technology, endow beings with the ability to manipulate the elements, and enrapture one with a lust so intense it consumes their very being.\nCrysal Lake, an impossibly deep caldera, keeps Aetherra's best-kept secret hidden: an aether deposit at the bottom of the Lake that joins directly to the aether core. Floating proudly above that secret is the island city of Fano. Once the prototype of symbiosis between mankind and aether, now the destitute remains of forgotten greatness.\nCrysal Lake Region Map\nIt's been generations since the inventors, a society of brilliant elves known only to historians as the Crysaleans, disappeared from Fano, taking the city's beating heart with them. Their disappearance is now a mystery as great as the outlandish architecture that supports this depraved city's crumbling walls.\nThe resolve of a young Indosian may present the spark of hope the citizens of Fano so desperately need: the hidden location of a fabled druid known as Gilgazo who belongs to an ancient order of sages devoted to mastering the instrumentation of aether. \nWill our heroes heed the call to recover the lost druid and save a city? And if they do, will they survive the journey?  \nThe Lost Druid is designed to deliver a deeply immersive gameplay experience utilizing a cinematic scene-based structure over traditional chapters. Every scene is meant to provide a unique mood as diverse environments are explored throughout the world of Aetherra. This feeling is primarily achieved through an audio accompaniment for each scene that provides both an ambient sound bed and an original composition, scored explicitly to construct the intended atmosphere for each scene.\nScene Guide\nAt the beginning of each scene is a QR code that can be scanned to navigate quickly to the corresponding audio. Links, like this one, can also be found in the scene's footer for easy access to the audio component from anywhere within the scene.\nEnvironmental Visual\nIn addition to audio, each scene includes a unique visual that captures the essence of the environment and is meant to be presented to players while they experience the scene. This environment is presented in the book at the beginning of each scene and is also available in high resolution static or motion cinemagraph for casting to a shared display at your physical table or virtual tabletop.\nAppendix\nScenes are deliberately constructed to be concise, enabling the GM to run them at a glance with minimal preparation. Mechanics, tangential story details, and elements of lore are off-loaded to a comprehensive appendix to maintain an easily scannable scene structure.\nAudiovisual Experience\nEach scene is designed individually with a distinct feel based on its intended story content. Some settings have a higher propensity for combat and therefore come with additional themes to support an action sequence. Others are more dramatic and come with themes to amplify a suspenseful moment or create a sense of space by shifting ambiance from an exterior to an interior perspective.\nThe Lost Druid comes with over 2 hours of original music to support your adventure in Aetherra, composed by acclaimed recording artist Jessy Ribordy. Each composition is handcrafted utilizing film-quality audio production tools, sounds effects, instrumentation, and recorded performances.\nJessy Ribordy (Composer)\nScene compositions are explicitly written to support long-form RPG gameplay with indistinguishable repeat and sonic variance, allowing tracks to loop for extended periods without feeling monotonous or repetitive.\nListen to the complete Main Title Theme above.\nThe Lost Druid is the first release in a series of multiple planned adventure modules that will take place within the original campaign setting, Lore of Aetherra. Instead of publishing a Campaign Setting supplement, our approach to building the world of Aetherra is through exploring its stories, locations, and characters. Each subsequent adventure will occur in a new area and traverse new concepts that build toward an expansive story world that will continue to grow over time.\nWe aim to make this approach possible by emphasizing the development of extensive lore throughout the adventure. The Lost Druid contains three in-world lore books written by non-player characters within Aetherra that your players can discover throughout the campaign. Lore books, once found, can be distributed to your players through individual PDFs and are also appended to the back of the physical book. We believe this world-building method enables players to take in as much or as little of the lore as they wish and still enjoy the setting.\nIncludes five pre-made playable character builds\nIncluded with The Lost Druid, are five pre-made Player Character builds with original artwork, custom backgrounds that fit within the world of Aetherra, and balanced starter stats. Enabling quick-start, out-of-the-box gameplay.\n*Based on currently completed content and assets. These numbers will likely increase.\nMr. Tarrasque Kickstarter Preview\nJoin RPG content reviewer, Mr Tarrasque as he walks through the Adventure Preview, samples the digital asset pack, and shares his thoughts.\nHelpful Goat Gaming Live-play One-shot\nWatch as the kind and talented humans at Helpful Goat play through a one-shot of the Adventure Preview on the Alchemy RPG platform.\nBob World Builder Quick Look\nBob World Builder shares a few thoughts on the features of the adventure in his video about the Pros & Cons of big campaign books.\nKickstarter Preview\nJoin Jeff McAleer over at The Gaming Gang as he walks through the Adventure Preview, samples the digital asset pack, and shares his thoughts.\nAlchemy RPG Platform\nAlchemy RPG, created by Chris Eddie and Isaac Overacker, is a revolutionary new way to play tabletop role-playing games online by providing a deeply immersive, cinematic experience to support a more \"theater of the mind\" style of gameplay. Designed to be both beautiful and intuitive, the Alchemy platform provides a truly unique alternative to today's virtual tabletop.\nA new gameplay experience requires a new approach to content creation. Early on in our development process, we made the critical decision to fork our efforts and develop both platform and content in parallel. As Super Mario was for the Nintendo, we aim to make Lore of Aetherra: The Lost Druid the catalyst to set the Alchemy platform's standard.\nAlchemy may provide the richest way to experience this adventure. Still, we also know that it won't be for everyone, which is why we're developing a physical version, PDF, and a digital asset pack to enjoy on your favorite virtual tabletop.\nJessy Ribordy is the Creative Director at Alchemy RPG. With almost two decades of experience in music and writing, he began his professional career as frontman and songwriter of the indie rock band Falling Up and has since expanded into composing for film and television. Inspired by both songwriting and storytelling, coupled with a passion for developing lore, Jessy is now using his creative talents to bring Aetherra to life in a truly unique way.\n Cole Nordin is an RPG book hoarder, professional Kickstarter, and the resident Game Designer at Alchemy RPG. A renewable energy engineer by day and Dungeon Master by night, Cole brings a lifetime of knowledge, passion, and experience crafting balanced game mechanics and narrative design to create the interactive backbone for the story world of Aetherra.\n Chris Eddie is the co-founder and designer of the Alchemy RPG platform. For over 13 years, he has worked as a Lead Product Designer for some of the world's most loved user experiences, including Amazon Music, Google Search, and currently, Netflix. Now Chris is bringing everything he's learned about designing world-class products to build a beautiful and intuitive role-playing experience within the world of Aetherra.\n Stu Harrington, a rogue paint slinger, is the Lead Artist and Art Director for Alchemy RPG. With over ten years of experience working in game art and fantasy illustration, he is currently one of the Senior Illustrators at Hi-Rez Studios doing splash art and concept design for games like Smite. A passionate artist, long-time gamer, and avid Dungeons & Dragons fan, Stu brings his expertise to make the world of Aetherra visually come to life.\n\nAdditional Artists\nHelen Ilnytska, Leon Tukker, Daniel Hasenbos, Jeff Langevin, Hanzel Haro, Max Schiller, Nargas Jafari, and Jordan Kerbow.\nEvery backer of Lore of Aetherra: The Lost Druid will receive exclusive access to playtest materials throughout the adventure book's final development phase. As a backer, you will be invited to join the private playtester channel on the Alchemy RPG Discord, where we will share in-progress PDFs of various game mechanics, story details, artwork, and music, allowing you to weigh in on the final adventure.\nAs a special thanks, all backers who join the playtest group will also receive credit with their names printed in the Lore of Aetherra: The Lost Druid book and PDF.\nWe'll be shipping worldwide! \nCharges will be collected once the campaign has ended through our pledge manager, BackerKit. Please note, pledge prices do not include shipping. Consult the chart below for estimated shipping prices but be aware that these costs may vary based on address and the state of shipping prices at the time of fulfillment.\nThank you...\nRegardless of the outcome of this campaign, we want to give a heartfelt thank you to a few folks who helped make it possible. Thank you to my sweet friends Lindsay Giebel and Hanzel Haro for making us a beautiful video. And thank you to Tyler Crumrine for being the epitome of what makes the TRPG community so wonderful by sharing his wisdom and advice with us. Make sure to check out his upcoming Kickstarter too!\nAnd thank you to those who choose to believe in this project with their support. It means the world to us.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nCreative Production\nAs of March 2021, our creative team is roughly 3/4 of the way finished with the end-to-end adventure. All primary art and audio for the core 12-scene experience is complete and ready to ship, mitigating the potential for long lead times or extraordinary costs due to outsourced creative services. The work that remains is the final draft, editing, and layout of the book's last three scenes, which our in-house team has projected to complete in the next four months. (July 2021)\n\nManufacturing & Fulfillment\nThe manufacturing of physical goods can come with a wide variety of risks and challenges. That's why we're working with one of the best (not the cheapest) book manufacturers available: The Friesens Corporation. Friesens specializes in high-volume, art-book quality printing and customer service. We're working directly with an assigned representative (Hi Elise!) on every detail of our order, from paper weight to freight.\n\nWe also understand the various challenges that come with international shipping and order fulfillment. That's why we won't be stuffing envelopes in our living rooms and making trips to the post office. Instead, we're working with the professionals at Funagain Logistics to ensure that parcels are properly packed, shipped, and routed through the best possible shipping routes throughout the world. Funagain's operation is also local to us, which will enable strong in-person communication and collaboration (if necessary) throughout the fulfillment process.\n\nFirst-Time Publishing\nLore of Aetherra: The Lost Druid is our first publication, and of course, this has come with several learning opportunities and challenges that we've had and will likely continue to have until its completion. But it also means that we have everything to prove in doing whatever we can to create the highest quality product and deliver it on-time. We have put forth a significant amount of up-front investment and effort to arrive at this position, and we will do whatever it takes to earn your trust, fandom, and repeat support for many more projects to come.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nLong-lasting design\nPrinting Industries of America (PIA) has awarded Friesens over 80 Premier Print Awards including multiple Benjamin Franklin awards (the \u2018Benny\u2019) for best printing in the world.

With the materials, codes, and clues hidden inside, you must use your ingenuity and match the objects to solve the case.\nWith this model, we want to expand the possibilities of traditional Escape Rooms. By not being dependent on a physical space we have greater freedom to:\n Create complex, different, and surprising puzzles that will blow your mind.\nImagine a more sophisticated story capable of immersing you in a complete narrative experience.\nFocus on investing in the quality and design of the materials to bring you a more dynamic and wider gameplay time experience.\nMake the game arrive all over the world.\n\nAfter the success of our first project Hack Forward, we want to give you a gaming experience as immersive as the first but, this time, focusing on another famous genre. Face the challenge by yourself or with a trustworthy group.\nThe box is the heart of the project where you will find the materials that serve as a bridge to connect the physical and digital world to live an immersive experience.\nHere you will find some examples of the puzzles and objects hidden in the box to solve the challenges that the adventure requires:\nTraditional puzzles\nSimilar to those found in the traditional Escape Rooms: Logic puzzles, reveal messages, interact with objects, use pencil and paper\u2026\n\nImmersive / Digital puzzles\nPuzzles that will make you doubt the boundaries between reality and fiction; exploring websites, news, videos, or spying on security cameras. Even in some cases, you will have to use everyday tools such as your email, social networks, chats, or mobile phone\u2026\n Investigation puzzles \nPuzzles in which you will have to consult and review the different clues and inconsistencies between the suspects, investigate old cases, compare different publications or objects and find the necessary evidence to solve the crimes committed ... or prevent them from being committed.\nAdvanced Puzzles\nIf we manage to reach certain stretch goals, we can add more complex, sophisticated puzzles, which could include magnets, embarking on missions in the real world, receiving phone calls, and higher quality components to get a more realistic and stunning experience, among other amazing surprises.\n\n*In order to avoid spoiling your experience, some of the puzzles shown above are examples. \n\n\nIf you want to get a taste of the inmersion of the game here you have the chance for free. The DEMO can be completed totally online without the box but it\u2019s nothing compared to the whole experience with the box.\n\nIn this new adventure, you will have to put all your deductive and investigative skills to the test because what seemed like an average case has become a twisted game.\nYour role will be to stop and unmask the terrible plans of a distinguished psychopath master of manipulation and specialist in the deepest and darkest instincts that guide the actions of the human being.\nYour passion for solving puzzles has made you fall into their disturbed game and all attention is focused on you. Who is behind all this? Why? If you like detective plots and crime movies and series, get ready because you are about to experience one for yourself.\nThe case will be divided into 8 chapters. Each one has its own objective and different challenges that can be completed in 1 hour, like a traditional Escape Room. You can play them all in a row or you can take a break and play another day.\n\nAt Key Enigma, we have decided to surprise you and test your and our community skills through an international treasure hunt.\nWHAT DO YOU NEED TO KNOW ?:\nWe have hidden 4 boxes in different parts of the world.\nEach one hides enigmas and puzzles that complement each other, this means that a box cannot be completely solved until the others are found.\nYou need to solve ALL OF THEM for the community to have access to the final prize.\nAnyone can take part in this treasure hunt, the reward will unlock a Stretch Goal on the Kickstarter.\nYou will find the keys to their locations at the end of the DEMO.\nYou have until May 6 to find and solve all the treasures to unlock the prize.\nShipping is charged after Kickstarter ends with a pledge manager.\nYour exact shipping address will be collected after the Kickstarter ends and we get close to the delivery date.\nThe European Union, USA will be \u201cShipping Friendly\u201d. Backers from these countries will not pay import taxes. We will be using fulfillment center partners to ship locally for each country.\nOutside of the EU, USA we cannot guarantee customs friendly shipping in these areas. There may be additional duties and/or fees charged by your country's governmental agencies and/or shipping partners that will be your responsibility.\nShipping approximate prices:\nSpain: 4\u20ac\nEurope: 9\u20ac (for most countries)\nUK: 12\u20ac (11\u00a3)\nUSA: 18\u20ac ($20)\nCanada: 15\u20ac ($22 CAD)\nRest of the world: 35\u20ac  ($38)\n\nNote that this shipping prices are for the Calling Card base game, if you purchased any add-on, the shipping price could increase. \nWe will send our games inside a cardboard shipping box in order to protect the game box as much as possible.\n\n\nWe are a startup that aims to launch different Immersive Escape Games themes (Terror, Adventure, Detective,...) that resemble the Escape Room experience but right in your home.\nOr even explore the possibilities of launching a subscription box with bi-monthly shippings.\nBut this project can only be carried if we get enough support through Kickstarter.\nWhy do we do it?\nAs big fans of Escape Rooms and Escape Games sometimes we encountered limitations for playing as often as we wished. And in times of Coronavirus, these limitations have undoubtedly increased.\nMobility restrictions\nEscape Room activity at 30% or 50%\nLockdowns\nThat is why we want to propose an alternative so that you can enjoy a good escape experience:\n Location: Most of the time we are limited to playing in our city or surroundings, and assembling a group of friends to go to a faraway Escape Room seems impossible.  Key Enigma box is at the best location: your home.\n   Variety & Innovation: Once you have played many traditional Escape Rooms they all start feeling the same. Our game is a breath of fresh air that will surprise you.\n   Cost: Escape Rooms are expensive! Our game is a fraction of the price.\n   Main Inspirations\nThe night of October 30th 1938 gave us the most famous radio broadcast in history: \"War of the Worlds\" by Orson Welles.\nOrson Welles certainly understood all the possibilities radio could offer and knew how to use it to carry out a very different entertainment experience from what people were used to. What we want to do now is to present a similar experience using the multiple communication options we have available nowadays.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIf you're new to Kickstarter: you can support our game by selecting one of the rewards we have prepared for you. If we reach our funding goal of \u20ac38.000, you will enable us to develop the game from start to finish in every detail according to our vision.\nThe amount of money you spend will only be collected if we reach our goal you will receive your rewards once the game is released. However, if we fail to reach our goal, your contribution won't be charged.\nThis is not our first rodeo, Albert Benitez former co-founder and CEO of Stream Hatchet, knows how to handle deadlines, and has a very specific plan of attack for this new project. And the amazing team that surrounds him has experience writing novels and scripts from start to finish and they also build Escape Rooms in their city. The team has the skills necessary to complete the vision of the company.\n\nOur biggest challenges to complete the game are:\nManufacturing and design: we want to make this game available at an affordable price. We have to talk with lots of providers and get a fair price because we want to include quality components, physical objects and elaborate puzzles.\n \nTechnology: we must form a credible digital universe in addition to testing and programming web pages, chats, email responses,\u2026 These components are being developed in house to bring the prices down due to the experience we have elaborating similar technological projects.\n \nNarrative: We want to naturally blend narrative, puzzles and technology to form a credible and immersive story given the tight budget\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u20ac89 or more", "title": "The Game", "descp": "EN: You will get our Game (10% discount off retail price)\n*Shipping is not included and will be charged in our pledge manager after the campaign.\n---\nESP: Recibir\u00e1s nuestro juego (10% de descuento respecto al precio de venta)\n*Los gastos de env\u00edo no est\u00e1n incluidos y se cargar\u00e1n en nuestro \"pledge manager\" despu\u00e9s de la campa\u00f1a.\nINCLUDES:\nCalling Card", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["1 backer", "Add-ons"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac120 or more", "title": "The Game - Deluxe Edition", "descp": "**Kickstarter Exclusive**\nEN: This limited edition includes the base game + 3 deluxe artifacts + deluxe packaging.

Sean Molley", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Grab that Victorian outfit from your closest and join the Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present, and Future on a time traveling adventure. You'll play tricks to each time period as you try to outwit your fellow travelers and collect enough wreaths to decorate all the holiday doors.\n\nGhosts of Christmas is a new version of the acclaimed hard-to-find Japanese game \"Time Palatrix\" by Taiki Shinzawa. Have you ever played \"spades\" or \"hearts\" and thought \"I wish this game had time travel?\"\nAll in a small 5 x 5 x 2 inch box\n\nGhosts of Christmas is a trick taking game where you play cards into three separate tricks: past, present, and future. You visit all three locations in a single round, and winning tricks in one time period could help you win more in the future!\n\nThe gameplay remains the same, but with a new optional variant for a more relaxed game.\nTwelve colorful characters inspired by A Christmas Carol by Charles Dickens.\n\nClick to view pdf. (This is a draft, not a final version.)\nTaylor is an avid player of trick taking games and has a YouTube channel dedicated to them. Ghosts of Christmas can sound confusing at first, but Taylor does a great job explaining how it all works.\nPlease Note: Prototype components are shown in the video. The final version will have some minor changes.\n\nAlso please note: This is one of the most creative Kickstarter preview videos we've ever seen. Give it a chance. You won't be disappointed.\n#1 Meeeaty - Some trick taking games are relaxing affairs. Play your highest card and hope for the best. In Ghosts of Christmas, there are multiple ways to approach each round and use brain cells.\n#2 Ripple Effects - When you don't have the cards to win in a straightforward way, sometimes you can engineer a change in who wins the \"Past\" trick in order to make the \"Present\" and \"Future\" trick work out better for you.\n#3 Dials - They're both fun and informative. A great visual way for everyone to keep track of which suit they can play to each ghost.\n#4 Different Variants/Difficulty Levels - If you want a more low stress evening (or you are just learning), play the variant without bidding. If you think you've mastered the game, try playing one of the TWO variants with the \"Beyond\" ghost that add even more options.\n#5 Bidding Options - Speaking of bidding, the ability to place an \"exact bid\" or a \"wiggle room bid\" gives you the option to play it safe or really go for that high score each round. \n#6 Small Box - It's a fact. Games in smaller boxes take up less room on your shelf, get taken to more game nights, and get played more. This is a small box game. (We work to keep even our \"big boxes\" pretty small.)\n\nPut on your hard hat and install factory tiles in this fast, furious and fun game of factory planning. Connect your tiles to build the best possible production chains. Whoever makes the most profitable factory wins!\nEfficiently packed into our 10.8 x 6.8 x 2.75 inch box\nLike Ghosts of Christmas, we're republishing this cult-classic by Corn\u00e9 van Moorsel because it deserves a wider audience. The gameplay will stay the same (if it ain't broke...), but it has brand new art.\n\nOur Touch:\n1. Added a sixth player\n2. Official variant to play without the quick grab element. Details TBD but will definitely be a part of the game.\n3. Added unique names and logos to each of the six company boards and score tokens to make the game more thematic and improve accessibility for color blind players.\n\nPlay solo, with a full table of six players, or anywhere in between.\nWhat's your favorite machine name?\n\nIt's a puzzle, but not a jigsaw puzzle. Like a \"How am I going to connect all of these? Did you just take the machine I wanted? I have no use for blue! Let's play again. I think I get it now.\" kind of puzzle.\nUnique names improve theming and accessibility\nClick to view pdf. (This is a draft, not a final version.)\nPlease Note: The game shown in this review is the original Factory Funner. Our version has the same gameplay, but all new artwork, and support for a 6th player.\n#1 Quick grabbing is rewarded - This game doesn't have analysis paralysis. When the machines are flipped over at the start of the turn, you have to decide which one you want. Too slow and someone will take your machine. Too fast and you will grab one that you thought would work ... but didn't.\n#2 Non-real-time variant - What about groups who don't like that real-time part of the game? We really think that is the best way to play, but we realize it isn't a fun or even possible option for everyone. We're including an alternative rule that removes all the speed elements and is still fun (in a different way).\n#3 Making it work - At some point during your game, someone at the table will be quiet for 30 seconds. Then they will announce, \"I think I can make it work.\" Pipes start getting laid. Reservoirs are moved around. The table will laugh at how ridiculous their factory looks. And in a few turns you will know if what they did was smart or short sighted.\n#4 You Will Improve - You might not be good at this game the first time you play it. You will get better. You will learn. You will overcome. And it will be rewarding.\n#5 Bad Grammar - Factory FunNER is the sequel and a very solid improvement to Factory Fun. It uses hexes instead of squares to allow more creative building, and some subtle improvements to scoring, length, and machine placement rules really improve things.\n#6 Solo Mode - You can play this game by yourself. Never know when that might come in handy.\n#7 On Tour - Factory Funner has a lot of similarities to our other game \"On Tour\".  It shares the roller coaster emotions and intuitive gameplay.  Whether you're building an optimized route, or installing the most efficient machines, you'll feel the same tension and joy of making it all work out.\n\nNote: Our game will NOT be an exact duplicate from these reviews, but the core gameplay will stay the same.\nZee Garcia's Kickstarter Pick of the Week | Dice Tower\nTurn into a high-flying stock trader as you work against the other players to control the market, buy and short stock, and make the most money.\nHave you been pumping cash into GameStop? Want to have the fun of making big bets without risking real cash?\nYou're going to thoroughly enjoy this brand new game that will bring you into the exciting and crazy world of buying and shorting stocks.\n*No financial knowledge required\n** Really does play within 60 minutes \nOur standard box size: 10.8 x 6.8 x 2 inch\nBear Raid is designed by Ryan Courtney, the same mind behind two other mind-bending games, Pipeline and Curious Cargo.\nThese are four of the character you can play as. What should the other two be? Leave your ideas in the comments.\nFor those who are wondering about the name, Bear Raid is a real phrase used to describe when a stock price is intentionally lowered through short selling and rumors.\nClick to view pdf. (This is a draft, not a final version.)\nPlease Note: The game in this video is a prototype and the final version will have some adjustments.\n\nAlso Please Note: We're super excited that Jac, who does not normally make board game videos, agreed to do one for Bear Raid since she's the most passionate person in the world about this game. She is responsible for getting Chad (Owner of BoardGameTables.com) to play Bear Raid and ultimately publish it. Part of Kickstarter is authenticity, so we wanted you to hear from a real fan.\nLater during the campaign, Chad will be interviewing Ryan Courtney about some of the different strategies in Bear Raid. We will post that here after the interview.\nSubmit a fake news headline and win a copy of the game!\nWe're hosting a contest over on Reddit.com/r/BoardGames where you can submit some ideas for a fake headline that will be used for one of the forecast cards in the game!\nEnter today! \u2192\n#1 Shorting Stock - Not many games let you do this. It is so much fun to short stock and then drive the stock down.\n#2 42 Dice & Event Interaction - Not a lot of luck (but some luck). 48 dice. It is a lot. It's not just a matter of chucking dice and moving the prices. Each company has dice, and they interact with different \"event cards\" every turn. It's a cool mechanic that lets you get a glimpse of what might happen next turn, but not a perfect picture.\n#3 Controlling What's Rolled - Not all the dice are rolled. You can influence what gets rolled. Leave dice on a company or take them back. Leave dice behind your screen or add them to the bag. These decisions are just as important as buying or shorting the stock.\n#4 Unspoken Alliances - There's not negotiation. But sometimes you will find you can go further if you and a \"partner\" work together. Maybe one person can't bankrupt a company by themselves, but two people working together can. Just watch out. Most partners want to do about 40% of the work and leave the other 60% for you.\n#5 Quick - Many financial/economic games are long, but Bear Raid packs all that action into 60 minutes.\n#6 Q.E. - Although our other financial game QE is certainly a different game, we really enjoy the genre. We think great financial board games are really under-the-radar. Wouldn't you agree?\n#7 Surprisingly Funny - You expect silly games to be funny. You don't expect a stock market game to have humor in both the gameplay and player's reactions to it. You could almost call it a party game.\n#7 Bears - Bears. Beets. Battlestar Galactica.\nSave 25% off the future MSRP!\nFor the gamers who want the absolute best from every game, you're in luck!\nWood components for the most handled pieces of Ghosts of Christmas and Bear Raid feel better in your hand.

In this way, every Co-Creator will reach the inverted eight, which happens to be the magical symbol of Infinity.\n\n\n\n\nBesides the above-listed eight monumental foundations on which EXITUS is built, it also has the following 10 important characteristics:\nCovid-19 has made the last year terribly hard for everybody, so we\u2019ve decided that our base package should cost just 17 EUR (and 12 EUR for any additional game) and within this price, we offer not the usual 1 hour \u201cEscape the Room\u201d game, but 10+ hours of puzzles, challenges, storytelling, and fun.\nAnd to all our future Co-Creators who are willing to choose a higher pledge level \u2013 THANK YOU!\nEach of you will not only get additional special extras but will also support us and our immense effort.\nOur goal is to make participation in the project as easy as possible, so the payment will be one-time and will take place on Kickstarter. This includes also the shipping costs when ordering the Co-Creator \u201eARTE FACTA\u201d reward level. \nIMPORTANT: When you pledge for the \"Arte Facta\"  Reward Level, the delivery price will be automatically added at the time of the pre-order. If you get a message that your country is not eligible for delivery, write us a personal message and we will check if we will be able to add your country of residence to the list.\n\n* (Lat.) an object that is made by a person, such as a tool or a decoration, especially one that is of historical interest.\nA set of FOUR mysterious, beautiful, and purely hand-made artefacts, included in the ARTE FACTA Reward Level.\nThis is the accessory that served as an inspiration for the magic bracelets worn by the main characters in the saga.\nIt\u2019s a bracelet with a unique design, hand-woven using a specific technique, and 414 precise needlepoint stitches. It features the Elbetitsa figure in which are coded several ancient symbols of health, wealth, and harmony.\nElbetitsa is one of the oldest images found in the solar calendars of many peoples and exists as a symbol in almost all of the main ancient religions in the world.\nApart from being an elegant accessory, the bracelet is A CLUE and unlocks an additional and self-contained chapter in the game where you can find yet one more unique puzzle.\nThe bracelet is unisex and comfortable to wear on the left or the right hand.\nBoth medallions bear the original design that inspired the images on the amulets that protect Marc and Zo\u00e9 during their adventure. They feature two ancient runic symbols dated back to the 1st century CE and found in many different written records across the world.\nThe material they are made of is pieces of wild cherry wood remaining after the making of furniture and usually thrown away as waste.\nOur master craftsman buys these beautiful pieces of waste wood directly from the furniture factory and turns them into hand-made works of art.\nBoth accessories are unisex, extremely comfortable to wear, with soft fabric necklaces.\nEach of the medallions is A CLUE to an additional and self-contained chapter in the game where you can find yet one more riddle.\nA top-secret object that will remain hidden until you receive it. What we can say now, however, is that it's created by us personally and for you to be able to solve its secret, it will require some extra courage because it could be even a little dangerous.\nThis item is accompanied by an additional and hidden story chapter, plus the clever hints if you need some help while solving the puzzle.\nThe challenges in EXITUS have been designed in such a way that they can be solved by one person or group of people.\n*If you prefer to read the story at your leisure and solve the puzzles by yourself \u2013 you do that.\n*If you want to share your enjoyment of the game with those close to you \u2013 your friends or family, you can do that as well.\nEXITUS is a game that illustrates the way an epic novel transforms into an unforgettable interactive experience when it is integrated with unique riddles, mysterious physical artefacts, music, sounds, portraits, graphics, and more.\nEXITUS is a lengthy pleasure which, depending on the speed of reading and of solving riddles, can even last for few days. That\u2019s why every time you close the EXITUS App, your last position will be saved automatically and when you next open the game, you\u2019ll continue from the point where you last left off.\nOnce you\u2019ve downloaded EXITUS App on your phone or tablet, you can go on to read the story and enjoy the music, sound effects, portraits, graphics, hints, the answers to the riddles \u2013 and in general, play the whole game from the beginning to the end.\nWithout internet. Everywhere. No limitations.\nYou\u2019ve been solving the riddles quite well; you are ahead with the story and are becoming more and more involved in its complications when suddenly \u2026 your progress is blocked by a puzzle for which you need a hint.\nAnd while you\u2019re frantically searching the internet for a helpful clue or waiting for another player to advise you on your next action, your initial excitement melts away and never comes back the way it was.\nWith EXITUS the above scenario is impossible.\nIf you need a hint, it\u2019s at your disposal at any moment because all hints, together with all the answers, can be found in EXITUS App and are always just one click away.\nThis allows you to choose your own tempo at which to move ahead in the game, as well as to make your own decision when or whether to use a hint.\n\nEXITUS doesn\u2019t come out of nothing.\nEXITUS is part of the world\u2019s first multilingual Challenge Book Game Series and although it has been created as a fully self-contained and independent game to be played with no prior preparation, the first two parts of the series come as a free bonus accompanying it. They contain the exciting prehistory of the events making up the story of EXITUS.\nIn addition, concealed in each one of these two mobile gamebooks are 12 challenging riddles.\nIf you want to trace the whole epic story from its very beginning, then Vol. 1 \u2013 PRAELUDIUM and Vol. 2 \u2013 CODEX are available to you completely free and they challenge you.\nDownload our first two Interactive Book Games - The Prehistory:\nGoogle Play  and  App Store\n\n\n\u0415XITUS will be available worldwide! If you have an email address and access to Google Play or App Store, you will surely receive and be able to play EXITUS, no matter where in the world you are.\n\n\n\n\nWe have some creative ideas for additional extras because our Co-Creators deserve the right to get truly and fully involved in the creation process of EXITUS.\nAnd to make this theme-related and exciting, every single new Stretch Goal will be accompanied and enhanced by a dedicated CHALLENGE in form of a riddle, puzzle, brainteaser, important Co-Creator's voting (watch out for these!), and other fun activities. So, for any new Stretch Goal, which will appear here, there will be a new Campaign Update where you can find out more about the challenge and how to get involved.\nUNLOCKED STRETCH GOALS:\nIf you like our approach, appreciate our effort, and want to support the campaign, the only thing we ask of you in return is to be active and share those challenges wherever and with whomever, you think appropriate and, in this way, to help us spread the word about our campaign.\nThe more backers we have, the more awesome extras we can put into EXITUS.\nHelp us reach more people!\nIN THIS VIDEO YOU CAN MEET US AND FOLLOW OUR STORY:\nFor many months now we\u2019ve been working hard, applying all the experience we have gained as creators and managers of two successful Escape the Room games, followed by those two unique virtual gamebooks:\nThis Kickstarter campaign is our PERSONAL INVITATION to all the fans of unusual, innovative, and exciting challenges.\nIf you\u2019re one of those people, now is the time to join us!\nBecome a Co-Creator of EXITUS and help us create a game that is an exciting challenge to the mind and a unique treat to the senses.\n\nWe rely on a solid and experienced team of professionals with proven expertise in their fields and with whom we\u2019ve already worked on our previous games. They are wonderful people, and we trust them unconditionally because with time, we\u2019ve become more than collaborators \u2013 we\u2019ve become friends.\nThe names of all those who have helped EXITUS to become a reality will be ceremoniously announced in the completed project and will remain part of it forever.\nEditors, translators, programmers, graphic designers, artists, puzzle testers, sound-recording experts, and \u2026 YOU. Because only with the support you give now will EXITUS become a reality, while we promise that the final result will very likely exceed all your expectations.\n\nTo make it as simple and easy as possible, for the Add-ons we will use the built-in option in Kickstarter.\nEach of our Co-Creators will have the chance to add to their pledge more additional EXITUS base packages at the exclusive price of only 12 EUR per game. \nSo, if you want to make a gift to a friend or family member, for the price of 12 EUR you will offer her or him something truly special - one unforgettable experience.\n\n\n\nThe packaging and sending of the rewards which include the ARTE FACTA Set will be done by a team of our own and directly monitored by us.\nIn principle, we can send those rewards to almost any country in the world. However, in view of the current situation dictated by a global pandemic, there may be some problems in receiving the package. If you believe that the country in which you live does not have a trusted postal system, you can choose a pledge level that does not require shipping.\nIMPORTANT: When you pledge for the \"Arte Facta\"  Reward Level, the delivery price will be automatically added at the time of your pre-order.

We do not expect any problems in completing the final version of the game because over 90% of it has already been created. \nHowever, when it comes to a multi-layered project like ours, there are certain parts of the process we cannot control. For example, unexpected illness of a team member, delay in the manufacturing process, global pandemic situation, or some force majeure circumstance. \nThat said, we promise that we will do absolutely everything we can to overcome any problem that arises, so we can fulfill our commitment to all our Co-Creators by delivering them the best possible version of EXITUS.

However, all decisions on part replacements due to damage occurred during delivery will be made at our discretion and on a case-by-case basis. \n\nRETURNED PRODUCTS: If you refuse to accept and/or collect your package on arrival, we cannot issue you a refund for the cost of the pledge. \n\nFAILURE TO RESPOND TO SURVEY: Surveys will be completed through Kickstarter.

Updated shipping costs:\nUS: $5\nUK: \u00a35\nEU: \u00a315\nThese prices may fluctuate of course, but that's the best estimate we can give right now. I hope these reduced costs allow more European backers to participate in this exciting project!\n$3500 Budget \nPiechart showing budget breakdowns\n $1,000 - Bone Marshes\n $1,000 - Patron's Cookbook\n $230 - Shortsword\n $630 - Barrow Keep\n $350 - Kickstarter Fees\n $290 - MISC (Joe Banner will be reviewing the print files and Richard will update PDFs for accessibility). \nThis is a decentralized printing run.

Sean Molley", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Relive the legendary Battle of Waterloo!\nExperience the third game in Hall or Nothing's award-winning Historic Epic Battle System (HEBS) card game series.\n18th June 1815, Napoleon Bonaparte is determined to rise back to power and claim all of Europe as his prize. But the forces led by an unassuming yet undefeated Arthur Wellesley and his charismatic Prussian ally Bl\u00fccher are amassing to stop Napoleon in his tracks.\nPlayers: 1-2 (up to 4 with additional sets)\nTime: 30-40 minutes\nAges: 10+ \n \u201cThe French system of conscription brings together a fair sample of all classes; ours is composed of the scum of the earth\u2014the mere scum of the earth. It is only wonderful that we should be able to make so much out of them afterwards\u201d \u2013 \nNotes of conversations with the Duke of Wellington, Philip Henry, 5th Earl Stanhope \n1815, Scum of the Earth is an asymmetric, competitive, tactical card game. It is the third game in the critically acclaimed Historic Epic Battle System, and successor to the award-winning games 1066, Tears to Many Mothers and 1565, St. Elmo's Pay.\nDeeply thematic, but richly and lovingly researched, 1815, Scum of the Earth presents the Battle of Waterloo as you've never seen it before.\nSince we hit \u00a390,261, peeps we'll have some special guests from Kilforth join us in the game too...\nFor the first time, you will now be able to play the Historic Epic Battle System (HEBS) with up to 4 players providing you have more than one base set!\nThere are normally only two leaders in each HEBS game, but the additional two bonus leaders included with every copy of 1815, Scum of the Earth \u2013 Prussian Field Marshal Bl\u00fccher and French Marshal Ney \u2013 allow you to play with 3-4 players when using two core games.\nWith two core games you will battle over 6 Frontiers, side by side with an ally \u2013 you can pass troops to each other via your Reserves, as well as being able to target either of your foes with events and abilities.\nYou can also play multiplayer by using and/or mixing 1815, Scum of the Earth with other previous HEBS games too. So if you want to, for example, pit Napoleon's armies of 1815, Scum of the Earth against the Ottomans of 1565, St. Elmo's Pay, now's your chance!\nIn 1815, Scum of the Earth, each player, as either the Duke of Wellington or Napoleon (and/or Bl\u00fccher and Michel Ney), musters troops and resources to overcome the various obstacles in their path before their armies clash in an epic battle over three farms forward of the ridge at Waterloo: Hougoumont, La Haye Sainte, and Papelotte.\nEvery arresting card in the game is inspired by a real person or event from the time. With a focus on quick, tactical play, and a thematic re-imagining of the events of the time, the game is non-collectable, and there is no deck building required. Each player simply grabs their deck and shuffles, then play begins. \nRelive the bloody Battle of Waterloo and the tumultuous events leading up to it, and stamp your mark on the history of the world... \nFrom the team behind the lauded Kilforth series of Fantasy Quest Games, Shadows of Kilforth and Gloom of Kilforth (Tabletop Gaming Magazine's Game of the Year Award winner) and 1066, Tears to Many Mothers (the beautiful game that launched the Historic Epic Battle System), 1815, Scum of the Earth is the ultimate card game of war and history. \nHall or Nothing awards\nIn 1815, Scum of the Earth both players race against each other to overcome a series of asymmetrical historical objectives that the British Duke of Wellington, Arthur Wellesley and the Emperor of the French, Napoleon Bonaparte had to overcome in order to battle each other at Waterloo. Returning from exile after his defeat at Leipzig, Napoleon is set to take on Europe yet again, and the fate of the world is in your hands!\n1815, Scum of the Earth is an asymmetric, competitive tactical card game in the style of Magic the Gathering but non-collectable. The complete game is in the box. Striking artwork complements sumptuous production values. All character names are taken directly from history. \nAs with all of our games 1815, Scum of the Earth is Solo Friendly. The game and all the cards contained in it are fully playable solo, and an 'AI' Foe with varying levels of difficulty for the enemy player has been developed in partnership with an expert team of solo players from the One Player Guild on boardgamegeek led by the great Paul Ibbs. Some cards even have solo specific effects too!\nThe Solo rules can be found here. \nSolo Against Multiple Foes?!\nFeeling particularly tough? Want to take on two Foes at once? With two core sets you can now play solo against two Foes simultaneously, each of varying difficulty if you so choose! Find out what it was like for Napoleon to take on the cunning of Wellington and Bl\u00fccher at the same time. Or reverse the situation and play as Marshal Ney and Napoleon against only Wellington, for example.\nUPDATE: We've also cleaned up the setup for solo play so you can now speed through the early game by getting to the cards your Foe can play much more quickly.\nThe first game in the series, 1066, Tears to Many Mothers won Game of the Year and Best Art awards and was a runner up in the Golden Geek and Origins Awards for 'Best Historical Board Game'. 1565, St. Elmo's Pay won the Dice Tower Seal of Approval as well as Tabletop Gaming Magazine's Must Play award.\n1815, Scum of the Earth honours this heady legacy whilst breathing new life into the system with all new and original art, all new characters, all new units, all new historical stories, and featuring brand new card abilities too...\n 3-4 Players (with 2 sets): Channel soldiers into your ally's battlefield \n Revamped Solo Play: Cleaner setup + battle multiple Foes! \n HEBS Weather Deck Expansion: Battlefield conditions that affect both sides! \n Squares, Lines, Columns: Historical formations for troops! \n Napoleon's Grand Battery: Invincible French cannons! \n Ridge Defenders: Educe Wellington's tactics to save your soldiers! \n Mired: Soak your enemies in mud and rain! \n Duelling: Target specific units to grind your foes to dust! \n Fated Characters: Powerful heroes whose deaths bring consequences!  \n Brothers-In-Arms: Killer units who bring their friends with them! \n Iron Will: Play units into stacks to double their effectiveness! \n Boost Rosettes: Pay more resources to power up cards as you play them! \n Reserves: Summon units into your Reserves, or even onto your allies' battlefields! \n and many more!\nTo combine with other existing (and future) games in the HEBS series, such as 1066, Tears to Many Mothers and 1565, St. Elmo's Pay each player simply chooses a faction from any box to play as. So the Knights of Malta from 1565 could battle the Saxons from 1066, or even the French from 1815!\nIn 1815, Scum of the Earth, each round players take turns to play cards and build their armies. Play units, characters, tactics, attachments, and events, all based on the real figures, weapons, and occurrences that resulted in Napoleon's downfall. \nWhilst racing each other to deploy the best army, players must also defeat a variety of historical obstacles that their respective leaders had to conquer on their way to Ligny, Quatre Bras, and Waterloo. Master Napoleon's bloodless revolution in Paris; experience Old Nosey's (Wellington's) marshaling of the Allied forces; not to mention Wellington's partaking in the Duchess of Richmond's glamorous ball in Brussels on the night before the bloodbath of Waterloo commenced. Many of the beautifully dressed officers lay dead in their dancing shoes within 24 hours...\nThe Battle of Waterloo is initially fought over three Frontiers of troops (just as the real battle was), represented by three Frontier cards: Hougoumont, La Haye Sainte, and Papelotte. Players compete for these cards by inflicting damage on them. Careful hand, resource, and tableau management is required for victory, and the first player to claim two Frontiers wins the game!\nExperience the immersive, narrative, history game like no other\nComplete stand-alone game\nCompetitive and Solo play\nExquisite hand management provides deep replayability\nFrenetic back and forth gameplay\nFrom award-winning designer Tristan Hall\nAlso compatible with 1066, Tears to Many Mothers and 1565, St. Elmo's Pay \nAward-winning Historic Epic Battle System game mechanics\nSumptuously illustrated chronicles: 100+ astonishing, unique images\nDeploy powerful units and characters\nBoost your cards with attachments\nPlay events to disrupt your foe\nManage your hand and your army tableau\nUse myriad special abilities\nProtect your leader at all costs!\n150+ high quality, breathtakingly illustrated cards\n100+ wooden and cardboard tokens\nThis campaign is all about 1815, Scum of the Earth \u2013 a complete game that contains everything you need to play and experience this incredible slice of history.\nBut if you love compelling history and fantastic gameplay and jaw-dropping art, then there are THREE GAMES for you to discover in the Historic Epic Battle System.

Sean Molley", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "That house on the outskirts of town, sitting empty behind a crumbling wall. The one people whisper about. The one that has gone unlived in for years. Sometimes a few hearty souls creep in, it is said, to see what treasures or secrets they can find. Most find nothing\u2014just an empty old house. Some return shaken. A few don\u2019t return at all.\nYou\u2019ve seen this house before. If not in this city, then in some other. You\u2019ve heard the rumors\u2014and if you haven\u2019t, well, someday they\u2019ll find you.\nWhat happens to a house when it sits alone for so many long years? What jealousies and hatreds does it quietly nurture? What whispers echo through its empty hallways? What waits, crouched within its dark rooms, hungering for the return of life?\nFor you.\nThe Darkest House is a tabletop roleplaying game (RPG) product built from the ground up for online play, with unique features that take advantage of the online environment for an awesome experience. It's compatible with the game you're playing now. In fact, it's made for it! That\u2019s because The Darkest House derives its horror from the bonds, backstories, ideals, loves, and fears your existing characters bring into it. Experiencing it will add depth to your campaign, your party, and your characters\u2014those who come out alive!\nCross the threshold. Explore The Darkest House. The experience will change and challenge your PCs, their party, and your gaming group. And you won't have to wait long: You'll  have everything you need to bring The Darkest House to your campaign in May (with extras and exclusives to follow).\nScroll down to try a preview of The Darkest House!\nThe Darkest House is a digital product designed specifically to the needs of running and playing games online\u2014and built to take maximum advantage of that mode of play. Think of it like an RPG book reimagined to make the most of the online environment. Every image and map is conveniently shareable and downloadable. Each encounter is formatted to your screen, giving you everything you need in a single view. Text for sharing with the players is easily copied with a single click. A rich network of hyperlinks makes navigation simple and intuitive. The Darkest House is as easy on the GM as the house itself is challenging to the PCs.\nUse The Darkest House in conjunction with your preferred online TTRPG platform: run your game on Zoom or Discord, or use a virtual tabletop (VTT) like Roll20 or Astral. Only the GM needs a copy of The Darkest House\u2014like a conventional RPG product, it gives the GM the information, resources, and tools to run the game, plus loads of handouts, images, and other sharable items to distribute, as appropriate, to the players.\nThe Darkest House consists of:\nThe downloadable product, containing the many dozens of rooms of the house itself. This is what the GM will primarily use during play. There\u2019s enough content for many visits to the house, and dozens of hours of play\u2014and through stretch goals the house continues to grow!\n The Darkest House: Secrets of the House in PDF, a GM's guide detailing the House's background, conversion rules, and the House Rules set you'll use as your PCs explore, and try to escape from, the Darkest House.\n The Darkest House Player's Guide in PDF, which gives players the character conversion rules and everything they need to explore (and try to escape from) the Darkest House.\nTo use The Darkest House, the GM will need a desktop or laptop computer running macOS or Windows and a broadband internet connection. Scroll down to try a preview of The Darkest House.\nHow It Works\nAlthough The Darkest House is a completely new type of product, you'll use it in basically the same way you use a typical RPG book or PDF\u2014it's just easier and has a lot more features for online play. You'll still use a VTT or videoconference platform (such as Roll20 or Zoom) to run your game. Your players won't access The Darkest House app itself\u2014like a physical adventure book, it's just for the GM. (You will share The Darkest House Player's Guide PDF, and loads of handouts, maps, and images with them, though.)\nHere's an example: Charles normally runs his games using Zoom for audio and video, and Slack for text messaging, sharing JPGs of handouts, and rolling dice. In addition, he has his game books and notes open on his desk beside him, or PDFs and other files open on his computer. When running The Darkest House, he'll use Zoom and Slack the same way, and keep The Darkest House app open on his computer in place of all those books or PDFs. He can share maps, images, and text with just a click or two, pasting them into his Slack channel as the PCs encounter new rooms, creatures, and clues.\nLaTia runs her games on Roll20. The Darkest House works the same way in that environment, with one additional advantage: LaTia can set up her encounters in advance, downloading the maps and resources before the game starts and setting them up within Roll20.\nTry It!\nWant to see how it works? Check out the preview of The Darkest House now for a look at a few of the rooms and features. Download it for either macOS or Windows (below). Open it, have a look at the intro page, and explore as you see fit\u2014or take this little tour:\nClick Explore The Darkest House Now on the right side of the intro page and you'll find yourself in the Boundless Room, just one example of the House's many, many rooms.\nSee the words Pried Up Floorboards on the map?

Click The Giggling Ghost at the bottom right of the screen.\nUnder the first set of boxed text, and click the Copy Text button. Return to this Kickstarter, go into the comments, and paste. That's how easy it is to copy and paste info for the players. Features like these make the most of the online environment\u2014making it an advantage instead of an impediment!\nYou can also share images and maps just as easily. Go to The Family Portrait and click Download under the handout to download the image, or \"Copy Link\" to paste the link into a chat or browser window to share it that way. You can do the same with the room map and main illustration.\nThe portrait holds the secret to escaping this particular room. Click the link to the Interior Courtyard to continue your exploration of the House.\nContinue to explore to discover the many ways The Darkest House stands apart from conventional RPG products. This preview of the app is not final and only demonstrates a small portion of The Darkest House. The final product may differ slightly.\nThat old house that everyone whispers about. That apartment at the end of the hall where no tenant ever stays for long. That strange unit in the station quarters sector, where everything seems a bit off. These are among the many entrances to the Darkest House.\nLike an invasive vine or a creeping shadow, the Darkest House insinuates itself into any universe. It is a malignant and primal force, unconcerned with the specifics of the worlds it seeps into. The Darkest House exists in our world\u2014in your world\u2014in any world. Wherever there is hunger, the Darkest House can gain a foothold. It is perfectly happy to take root in your campaign.\nOr campaigns. The house draws from the many worlds it touches. It need not pull all its victims from the same setting. Imagine an experience that gathers your favorite characters from different campaigns to work together to survive its horrors. As a product specially designed for online play, scattered gaming groups can come back together for a unique reunion experience.\nThe Darkest House\u2019s effect on character development and backstory makes it really shine when introduced to existing characters and campaigns. It will influence the quality of play for long after the characters have escaped it. \nInject the Darkest House into your ongoing campaign as a horror interlude or as a recurring encounter. It works as a standalone one-shot, but there\u2019s far more to the house than that. With many dozens of rooms (and growing, through stretch goals) adding up to 30-50 hours of game play, PCs who escape the house might stumble upon it later, seek it out to further plumb its mysteries, or find themselves drawn into it again to free themselves and their world of its darkness.\nThe house has many aspects, and there will always be more to discover.\nThe House System\nThe Darkest House isn't just compatible with the game you\u2019re already playing\u2014it was made for it! Within The Darkest House, you\u2019ll use the House System. You\u2019ll quickly and easily convert your existing characters (it takes about five minutes) and use those stats while in The Darkest House. Once the PCs emerge, your players will return to their regular setting using their regular character sheets. The House System is a sort of RPG Rosetta Stone, allowing easy translation into and out of any game system\u2014and even letting you bring characters from different games together.\nThe House System is tailored for tension and terror. With each die roll, the players roll the House Die, which might indicate that the house itself takes an action. Players can call upon the essence of the house while they're within it to turn a failure into a success, but every time they do so they accumulate personal Doom. Escaping the house with the weight of such Doom on their shoulders, characters may find themselves scarred, cursed, or haunted in all manner of disturbing ways, carrying remnants of their experience back into their home campaigns long after they've left.\nIt's possible to launch a campaign centered around the Darkest House. But that's not what the house wants. It is strongest when it reaches into an ongoing campaign to test and challenge existing characters. That\u2019s because events in the Darkest House will change characters and alter the campaign setting. The house gets its metaphorical claws into those that cross its threshold, and the house itself changes based on who those characters are, who they have loved, who they have hated, and where they have been. Characters who explore the house and make it back out are never quite the same.\nWant even deeper mysteries? More secrets? More dangers? The Devoured Halls is a separate portion of the Darkest House, with its own rooms, its own secret entrance and exit, and its own mysteries to uncover. Within this section of the house, characters might discover that perhaps the house isn't fully in control of itself\u2026 the house itself might be broken. While The Darkest House is a complete package, The Devoured Halls adds its own flavor and offers its own experience in keeping with the rest of the house. It fits in seamlessly and offers additional depth and an entirely new mini story for characters to investigate. \nThe Devoured Halls backer level includes the complete Darkest House plus the additional content in the Devoured Halls\u2014a Kickstarter exclusive available only through this campaign. Backing at this level has even more exclusive benefits\u2014you also get:\nMonte Cook's secret tour of the Darkest House: In the style of a director's commentary track, Monte takes you on a video tour of the House covering his favorite rooms. He delves into their genesis and inspiration, gives you insights into the lore behind them, and talks about how he's used them in his own games.\nThe Darkest House digital art book: The Darkest House contains dozens and dozens of illustrations, all as mysterious as they are beautiful. The Art of The Darkest House presents all of them\u2014including illustrations from the Devoured Halls\u2014in beautiful detail. Annotations by Monte and Art Director Bear Weiter accompany many of the illustrations, and several also include details or alternate versions calling out their secrets and hidden features.\nMonte Cook has designed many RPGs over his 30+ year career, including Dungeons & Dragons 3rd Edition, the Cypher System, Numenera, and Invisible Sun. He wanted to share why he he was inspired to create The Darkest House, and what design decisions he made. Check out his insights below.\nI'm Monte Cook, and I created and designed the Darkest House. I've been using the essence of it in various campaigns for years, and I thought I'd take a moment to describe why I designed it the way I have, and hopefully why you'll find it intriguing and interesting as well.\nWhy Focus on Online Gaming?\nAt Monte Cook Games, we're spread out all across the continent. We've been regularly playing RPGs on Zoom or Roll20 since well before the pandemic, as of course many gamers have. In the 21st Century, gaming online has become a standard feature of tabletop games, and the last year or so has accelerated that aspect of running and playing games to an incredible degree. Gaming online has its own challenges, but it has its own strengths as well. As a designer, I've been pondering how to not just focus on the needs of online play, but to in fact embrace online play, bringing the aspects of gaming that it does particularly well to the fore. The ability to share art, to share text, and to send individual players direct messages are just some of the things that The Darkest House not just enables but shines a spotlight upon. Meanwhile, the difficulties of online gaming, such as managing lots of information, maintaining a mood, and dealing with cumbersome mechanics are all facets of the experience that the Darkest House eases.\nWhy Focus on Cross-System Play?\nOne of the things that's been true of a lot of us over the last year is a desire to reconnect with old pals or faraway friends. If your primary means of socializing is a video conference, people a thousand miles away are no farther away than those up the street. Still, talking to your friends through a computer screen can sometimes be hard. With all the additional barriers that online gaming can create, why should game systems add another?\nThe Darkest House offers an easy way to quickly convert the essence of any character from any system into a simple but interesting character who operates within the house's own, specific rules, tailored to the experiences within. My dream is that people will use The Darkest House as an excuse to rekindle that lapsed campaign with their old gaming group separated by time and distance, regardless of what system was being used. Or, perhaps even more exciting, the GM who's got a selection of friends who never regularly game together and use different systems can take their existing characters, temporarily convert them to the House System, and all go on an exciting and challenging (or horrifying) adventure together.\nI believe that RPGs bring people together, and I hope that The Darkest House brings people together who might not otherwise get to easily enjoy each other's company. (And what better way to rekindle old bonds than in absolute terror?) \nWhy a Haunted House?\nInspired by games like Kitty Horrowshow's Anatomy, books like Mark Z. Danielewski's House of Leaves, and films like Stanley Kubrick's The Shining, I realized that the horror genre and haunted houses in particular offer unique opportunities to shine a light on characters, and RPGs are all about characters. I wanted to create an adventure that would deepen the characters even as it put them through their paces.\nWhen PCs enter the Darkest House, they'll find far more than just a haunted house. It is a crucible of sorts, where their mettle and their minds will be tested. Those who fall short will suffer heavy consequences. Those who can hold their own, however, emerge more deeply developed with a greater insight into their world, their companions, and most of all themselves. The Darkest House forces players to think about their characters' deepest fears, dreams, their families, and their faith in their friends. Encounters are designed to focus less on damage dealt or resources used and more on the personalities, past experiences, and fundamental truths of a character. And if a character is lacking any of those, the Darkest House will enable the GM and players to work together to create them, or flesh them out, as needed.\nIf you've read this far, you've very likely picked up on the fact that within the Darkest House, it's the house itself that is the enemy. I have long had a fascination with fictional places with a mind or an essence all their own. And when that essence evolves over a long period of loneliness, neglect, and exposure to darkness and suffering, it makes for a truly unique \"villain\" far different than any ghost, specter, or demon could ever hope to be. And if that location, that house, grows and seeps in both space and time, devouring the very locations and loved ones important to those that cross its doorstep, well... I don't want to get into spoiler territory. Let's just say, if nothing else, The Darkest House certainly offers some unique experiences that will create stories your players will be talking about for years to come.\nIf you choose any physical add-on items, please check our Kickstarter Redemption page for information on reward redemption and shipping costs.\n\n This project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 1,100+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $460M raised between them.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is the nineteenth Kickstarter campaign for Monte Cook Games.

The only real challenge we run into during campaigns concerns making our estimated date of delivery. The issues that can effect the release date of the final product are: production delays, shipping delays, and customs delays. (things outside of our control).\n\nWe are working with our manufacturer, Panda Games, to ensure we create the best product possible. We instill our full trust in them, as we\u2019ve worked with them in producing all our games, expansions, and booster packs. We couldn't be happier with how smooth the process has been with them on these projects.\n\nWe will communicate all updates on our project in a timely manner as your trust in us is very important. We want to make sure you get the best product possible and have the best time playing it.\n\nAs we've also had experiences with different fulfillment partners during our prior Kickstarters, we'll be waiting until the end of the Kickstarter to make a final decision on our shipping partner, to make sure we find the best fit for our campaign both in terms of price and service for our backers.\n\nWe are very grateful to our backers and fans for their excitement for this Kickstarter and look forward to welcoming new players to our little town of Tall Oaks.\n\nREFUND POLICY\nWe are able to refund your pledge within 14 days of the Kickstarter campaign ending. After 14 days, we will no longer provide a refund.

Sean Molley", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Back in late 2019, I was working a job I really didn't enjoy and feeling very creatively frustrated so I pondered an idea for a new puzzle book. (I had just released my first book in July of that year.) Inspired by choose your own adventure novels of the past, I thought wouldn't it be good to have a puzzle book whereby every page you solve gives you a numerical answer which would take you to another page in the book, and so on... \nSomething disconnected from phones and the internet that you could stick in a bag and take with you on a long journey or lay in bed at night solving. Then after a few months, scribbled in a notebook stashed in my pocket, The Paper Labyrinth was born.\n\nThe basic premise of the book is that you solve a variety of riddles and puzzles, each giving you a direction to somewhere else in the book. Some are single puzzles, some have multiple parts but ultimately you should be able to solve the entire book - but The Paper Labyrinth ends unresolved. The player is left with a 5-digit-code and the promise that some day that code will unlock something new...\n\n\nFast forward to now, 2021. The Paper Labyrinth is the best selling book I have ever published and I think it is time to write a second (and final) installment. I've already started writing, sticking to the popular format of The Paper Labyrinth, but adding new twists including alternate paths through the book, a few tricks and traps, and some decisions for the reader to make which I hope will make the already addictive format even more engrossing! This is where your help comes in, pledging to help me create this book helps me dedicate time to work solely on this project and create something (hopefully) as good or even better than the original!\n\nADDED EXTRAS:\nDue to your amazing and overwhelming support, I have added a few extras to the books which will come with all rewards;\nBOOKMARKS MINI GAME - Everyone needs a bookmark (especially in The Paper Labyrinth) and these aren't just that - they're a mini puzzle game too! (And just like The Paper Labyrinth, in two parts!) The first will come with any add-ons of Book One and The Power of Four, and the second (or both bookmarks) will come in July with your copy of Book Two / The Complete Book! They line up with eachother allowing you to solve them once you're all done with your book.They are printed both sides with a lovely foil effect on the front!\nDUST JACKETS AND INNER COVER PAPERS - (for all hardback 'The Complete Paper Labyrinth' pledges) these will help keep your book in the best condition possible and hopefully feel a little extra special!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nBeing based in the UK (now no longer EU), shipping is always a concern, but I regularly ship books to EU / Europe / Worldwide and have updated my shipping costs on here to reflect the current situation.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nReusability and recyclability\nA hard wearing book is key.

Everdell is a game of dynamic tableau building and worker placement played over four seasons. Whoever makes the most impressive city wins! \n\nOn your turn, you can take one of three actions:\na) Place a Meeple: You have a collection of wooden Critter meeples. You can place these on the board locations, events, and on Destination cards. Critter meeples allow you to perform various actions to develop your city: gathering resources, drawing cards, and taking other special actions.\nb) Play a Card: Each player is building and populating a city; a tableau of up to 15 Construction and Critter cards. There are five types of cards: Travelers, Production, Destination, Governance, and Prosperity. Cards generate resources (twigs, resin, pebbles, and berries), grant abilities, and ultimately score points. The interactions of the cards reveal numerous strategies and a near infinite variety of working cities.\nc) Prepare for the next Season: Critter meeples are returned to your supply and you gain bonuses depending on the season. The game is played from one year\u2019s winter through to the end of autumn. Players add up the points from their cards and other bonuses and whoever has the highest total wins!\nNew content that will delight and surprise you for many more seasons to come!\nGolden Occupied Tokens\nThe new Critter and Construction cards in Newleaf are played like normal Critter and Construction cards from the base game, except that you use Golden Occupied tokens instead of normal occupied tokens. These Golden Occupied tokens are limited -- a player can never use more than 3 in a game! These new cards are very powerful, so choose wisely which you'll spend your Golden Occupied tokens on! \n\nThrough Every Season Cards\nSince the beginning of Everdell\u2019s history, farming has been a vital part of the valley\u2019s way of life. Farmers face a number of challenges through the four distinct seasons of the year and must adapt as the weather changes. Experience the story of an Everdell farm throughout the year!\nThe 8 new special Farm cards in Mistwood replace the basic Farms in your Everdell game. These often give you the choice of two abilities, and you choose which of these abilities to use each time the card activates.\n\nMore Legends\nLegendary cards represent unique Critters and Constructions that are powerful upgrades of other Critters and Constructions. Use them when you are familiar with the base game, and are looking forward to a twist on a regular game! The More Legends cards in Mistwood are added into a game of Everdell in the same manner as the Legends from Everdell: Collector's Edition.\nNew ideas are arriving every day!\nStation Cards\nFaceup Critter and Construction cards on the Station board work like Meadow cards and may be played on your turn, but whenever you play a card from the Station, also gain the reward listed on the Train Car tile beside the card! This reward is gained after you have fully resolved the played card and any additional cards that may have activated as a result. After you've gained the reward, replenish both the Train Car tile and the card played.\nRemember: cards on the Station board are not Meadow cards, and therefore any abilities that affect Meadow cards (such as the Inn) do not apply to Station cards!\n\nVisitors\nNewleaf is a bustling and growing city in Everdell, and now that the railway system is in full operation, many new critters and big ideas are coming into the Emerald Valley. The Visitor cards that come into play on the Station Board offer players a new end game scoring opportunity!\nTo gain a Visitor card on your turn:\nPlace a worker on the Station. The Station is a shared location, allowing several workers at once, but you may only have 1 of your workers on this location at a time.\nChoose 1 of the faceup Visitor cards and discard it facedown on the Visitor discard pile.\nReveal 1 new Visitor card and choose 1 of the 2 faceup Visitor cards to take and place by your city. If you do not want either of the faceup Visitors, you may draw 1 from the top of the Visitor deck instead. If you selected one of the faceup Visitors, replace its card with another one from the Visitor deck.\nGain the reward shown on 1 of the Train Car tiles by the Station; set that tile aside and draw a replacement tile.\nVisitor cards will score their listed point values, if your city contains their requirements at the end of the game. Visitor cards that you have obtained and failed to please (by not meeting their requirements) are not worth any points at the end of the game.\n\nThe Knoll\nYou may place a worker on the Knoll to choose any 3 cards from the Meadow and/or the Station to discard. Replenish the discarded cards from the main deck, and draw any 3 cards into your hand from the Meadow and/or the Station. After drawing your cards, you may then gain the reward shown on 1 of the Train Car tiles. Set that Train Car tile aside and draw a replacement tile from the bag. Finally, replenish the 3 cards you drew into your hand.\nThe Knoll is a shared location, allowing several workers at once, but you may only have 1 of your workers on this location at a time.\nEverdell has a brand new villainess!\nNow while playing Everdell, you can pit your wits against Nightweave, our newest automated player for solitaire and two-player games. Nightweave is designed to function like a real player at your table: she has her own hand of cards, Prepares for Seasons on her own schedule, and, most importantly, she has her own agenda!\n\nNightweave has her own Big Critter meeple along with 8 spider meeples (not just 6!) that will move about the board to do her bidding -- blocking exclusive Locations, taking events away before you can get them, and even enacting Plots and Plans that will interfere with your options as a player, reminiscent of the Weather cards from Spirecrest.  She has eight different personalities that influence what she targets and focuses on, so there's lots of variety in gameplay!\n\nWhat Happens on Nightweave's Turn?\nTurn over the top card of Nightweave's Activity deck. These cards are the heart of her decision-making during the game, instructing her to play cards into her city, place spider meeples on previous, exclusive Locations, take a Basic or Special event, etc.\nNightweave will perform the first action listed for her current season, if possible. If she cannot perform this action for any reason, she will take the second action for her current season. If she cannot take that action either, she will perform as much of the Default action at the bottom of the card as she can. This could include discarding cards, collecting point tokens (yes, really!), and/or a number of other actions.\nIf Nightweave herself is in the Meadow and there are no spiderlings left in her lair when she draws an Activity card with a Spider or Nightweave icon, she will Prepare for Season. \nThe game ends when you run out of actions and when Nightwave Prepares for Season at the end of Autumn.\n\nCan you stop Nightweave from taking over Everdell? Check out the Rulebook for more in-depth information about this automated player! \nhttps://static1.squarespace.com/static/5eefaf5a2819042bf0d4099b/t/6047b72c79a2da41d1f2a50c/1615312716704/Prototype+Rulebook+%281%29.pdf\nAll items shown are available as add-ons in Kickstarter and will also be available to add to your pledge in the Pledge Manager after the campaign.

Based on previous campaigns, we anticipate that you should not have any additional fees associated with receiving your reward package (customs, clearance, etc.) if you\u2019re in one of these regions. If you\u2019re outside of one of these regions, you may need to pay customs fees, specific taxes, and/or other local fees. Please see the FAQ and check with your local authorities for more details. \nIf your reward is shipping to one of the destinations shown on this More Shipping Destinations chart, we are not collecting taxes or customs fees, but it may ship from a local hub. The Destinations Summary below details which countries are in which regions. \nIf you're outside of the countries included in this Destination Summary, please reference the Expanded Worldwide Shipping details below. \nWe originally did not offer shipping to destinations outside of those listed in our Destination Summary due to cost and reliability concerns. We are now able to offer shipping to all destinations outside of those listed above only if the backer accepts that we are unable to provide free reshipments for any packages lost in transit (We typically offer one reshipment at no additional shipping cost for areas listed on our Destination Summary.) \nWe plan to ship these packages worldwide from our fulfillment center in Germany (for best cost), so please take that into account when considering your import costs. Due to the reliability challenges for destinations not listed specifically in our destinations graphic above, if your package is lost in transit, we will only be able to provide you with a reshipment if you pay the shipping cost again.\n\nBy backing this campaign and asking us to ship your rewards to an address outside of the locations listed on our Destination Summary, you understand and agree that you are responsible for paying the cost for a reshipment in the event that your initial shipment is lost in transit. The reshipment cost for lost packages is the same cost as listed on the shipping table here. You also agree that you are responsible for paying any taxes, customs, and other local fees or charges associated with receiving your rewards. \nWe collect and remit taxes for each of these regions described below, as required by local law and our scope of business. Some regions do require that taxes are remitted based on both the product cost and shipping cost, so keep that in mind as you plan for these costs. Taxes will be collected in the pledge manager after the campaign along with shipping. Remember, we are a US company registered in these territories, so rates may be different than you\u2019re used to seeing for local companies! Please see below for more information about the tax rates to be collected for each destination. The pledge manager will calculate and collect the appropriate tax based on the many requirements in place at the time the pledge manager runs. For all destinations outside of these specifically listed below, you may be required to remit local taxes yourself.\nClick here to see local tax rates in the U.S.\nWe collect and remit sales tax in all US states where we\u2019re required to by our scope of business and local laws.

Sean Molley", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Lone Shark Games, the publisher of the puzzle novel The Maze of Games and Puzzlecraft: How to Make Every Kind of Puzzle, brings you our newest foray into puzzle fiction: the crossword comic Letters to Margaret. Here's Hayley Gold, the cartoonist behind this groundbreaking new type of graphic novel.\nHey, Kickstarter crowd, this is Hayley Gold, crossword cartoonist, here to present you with my latest puzzle-based comic, Letters to Margaret. Here\u2019s what it\u2019s all about:\nIf you thought the world of crosswords was black and white, you\u2019d be\u2026 mostly right. They, like all of us, are caught in a highly polarized imbroglio between sides stuck in their black and white thinking. Well, maybe it\u2019s time to consider how the other side sees things. So, I made a similarly polarized comic. It\u2019s so polarized that it\u2019s literally divided in half. The same series of events are twice-told, each from a different character\u2019s perspective, and each packing a different set of solvable crosswords by Mike Selinker and Andy Kravis. You can solve along and take the puzzles apart with the characters, maybe gaining new perspectives on things as you work your way through each side.\nPrototype books seen from the front and back. Image not final.\nOne side\u2019s protagonist, Derry Down, believes that the New York Times crossword reinforces stereotypes, is non-inclusive, and uses offensive clues. Across the aisle (and the bookbinding) is Margaret \"Maggie\" A. Cross, who's maddened by blogger critiques that call for stemming the choice of words and topics broached in the NYT crossword in the name of sensitivity. The twosome\u2019s opinions clash on the web, in the crossword blogosphere, and IRL on the campus of Columbia University \u2014 but to complicate things, Maggie is visited by the voice of puzzles past: Margaret Farrar. The first editor of the Times crossword emerges in the form of letters, as Ms. Farrar attempts to edit Maggie\u2019s amateur puzzle with a 1960s sensibility.\nLetters to Margaret offers a closer look at the issues facing crosswords today from multiple perspectives and multiple time periods, and all sugar-coated with a healthy dose of romcom antics and puzzles for the reader to solve alongside the protagonists. So, in a crossword landscape \u2014 and a sociopolitical landscape \u2014 that\u2019s so strictly divided, can two sides meet to create a whole? That\u2019s a puzzle that is literally for you to solve.\nLetters to Margaret is a 128-page graphic novel split in two parts, one facing the opposite direction from the other. You can read Maggie\u2019s tale first or Derry\u2019s tale first and your reading experience will be different each time. But that\u2019s not all you can do. Letters to Margaret is the first comic book you can solve.\nIf you\u2019re a fan of Lone Shark\u2019s interactive novel The Maze of Games, you may have a clue where this is going. But \u201chaving a clue\u201d is the whole point of the book. The book is loaded with crossword puzzles that you can solve before they appear in the characters\u2019 hands. Several are puzzles of the kind you\u2019d find in the New York Times \u2014 in fact, in the story, they are NYT crosswords ranging from Wednesday to Saturday in difficulty. Others are the crosswords that Maggie, an up-and-coming cruciverbalist (that\u2019s a fancy term for a crossword constructor), submits to the New York Times \u2014 and then gets a few edits from its long-passed editor, Margaret Farrar.\nThe crosswords are constructed by my friends Andy Kravis, a puzzle editor at the New Yorker, and Mike Selinker, who wrote and constructed The Maze of Games among many other puzzle projects. You can read the book without solving the puzzles, letting the characters guide you through the crosswords. Or you can solve the puzzles first and experience the world of crosswords the way the characters do.\nThank you for asking! You can read the first chapter of Maggie's book on this page. Or you can just look at the sample pages and images below. Here you can see the adventures of Maggie, Derry, Amanda, Prof. Dodgson, and our two arrows, Ebony and Irony, who provide narration throughout.\nLetters to Margaret is a 128-page premium graphic novel. You can get the printed book at the $24 level. Each physical book comes with a PDF so you can print off the crossword pages and solve them without writing in your book, if you so choose. For crossword aficionados, we\u2019ll also provide the puzzles in the .puz format, which allows solving in apps such as AcrossLite. And there's a digital art and puzzles pack with all sorts of goodies in it (see Are There Stretch Goals?).\nPrototype book. Image not final. Oreos not included.\nYou can get just the digital book at the $10 level. The digital files will come with a PDF and the .puz crossword files, as well as everything in the digital art and puzzles pack.\nCode pencils. Image not final.\nIf you want some pencils to solve the book, we've got the pencils for you. At the $63 Solver's Bundle level you'll get the physical and digital books and our hand-crafted code pencils, with a host of solving tools printed on the sides. We haven't sold code pencils for six years, so we're thrilled to bring them back. Designer Eric Harshbarger has created six unique Letters to Margaret code pencils, each of which provides a set of tools for solving puzzles. On each pencil's six faces are six codes or sequences critical for puzzle solving (though you don't need them for the crosswords in this book). In each dozen, you get two each of the following:\nPencil #1: Alphabet, Braille, Morse code, binary, ternary, index numbers (1-26),\nPencil #2: Alphabet, moon type, nautical flags, semaphore, American Sign Language, pigpen\nPencil #3: Numbers, Roman numerals, telephone keypad letters, people on U.S. paper money, people on U.S. coins, keyboard shift characters\nPencil #4: Months, days in months, birthstones, Chinese zodiac, zodiac symbols, western zodiac\nPencil #5: Numbers, powers of two, square numbers, cubic numbers, prime numbers, Fibonacci sequence\nPencil #6: Powers of ten, SI prefixes, SI symbols, imperial ruler in inches, metric ruler in millimeters, magnitudes\nFinally, you collectors can get a signed book with signatures from the creative team at $75 Signed Graphic Novel level. Or you can add to that a set of pencils at the $99 Signed Solver's Bundle level. Or you can get all that and a whole library of Lone Shark books at the $200 Every Lone Shark Book level.\nThere are no shipping costs listed, because you\u2019ll add those on in Lone Shark\u2019s pledge manager after the campaign ends. Shipping costs will be approximately $10 to $12 in the United States and Canada. We\u2019re sad to say that puzzle books cannot be shipped Media Mail, because the U.S. Postal Service doesn\u2019t like fun. The physical goods can only be sent to the U.S. and Canada, because the shipping cost elsewhere is insane.

The pages are in the wrong order, and you have to solve the puzzles to make the narrative make sense. You can get the hardcover and its companion projects The Theseus Guide to the Final Maze, the Maze Map, and The Keymaster's Tome separately or in one Keymaster's Bundle.\nPuzzlecraft: How to Make Any Kind of Puzzle is our puzzlemaking guidebook, written by Mike Selinker and Thomas Snyder with a foreword by Peter Sagal. You can get it with The Puzzlecraft Workbook, a handy primer by Gaby Weidling that puts your puzzlemaking skills to use on a project.\nDealer's Choice: The Complete Handbook of Saturday Night Poker details all the basics of poker and then dives into more than 400 poker variants, many born from the fevered imaginations of authors James Ernest, Phil Foglio, and Mike Selinker. Features many hilarious illustrations by Phil.\nGame Theory in the Age of Chaos is Mike Selinker and Richard Malena-Webber's 532-page tome of essays about politics and game theory. If you want to make sense of the last half decade through the lens of Risk, Monopoly, and D&D, this book will help with that.\nThere's a $200 Every Lone Shark Book level that gets you a signed copy of Letters to Margaret and everything in this section, including the bonus mini-comic.\nFor any of those books, complete your pledge and select what you want from the Add-On menu. Other Lone Shark products will be made available in our PledgeManager after the campaign ends.\nThere are! We unlocked eleven stretch goals during this campaign!\nWe've added two 50-crossword digital volumes called Crosswords of Wisdom, a digital wallpaper set, \"outtake\" puzzles that didn't make it into Letters to Margaret, a digital book of tile crosswords, another crossword pack, a digital bonus Letters to Margaret story with a Robyn Weintraub crossword, a digital pack of rows garden puzzles, a cartoon crossword sampler from Patrick Merrell, two digital packs of marching bands, and a digital giant crosswords puzzlepack.

For the length of the campaign, you\u2019ll get messages from a secret admirer who will shower you in New York Times-style mini-crosswords. You can solve these crosswords in the updates to earn conversation heart badges! These convo hearts have a zoological touch that crossword fans will love. Because everyone knows that when puzzles and LOVE mix, you get a VOLE.\nThere are seven mini-crosswords, each leading to a candy heart badge that features an animal that shows up in crosswords a lot, such as EMU. Each crossword also contains an answer that\u2019s an animal. Here are all the mini-crosswords:\nThe first puzzle for the Red heart is here!\nThe second puzzle for the Orange heart is here!\nThe third puzzle for the Yellow heart is here!\nThe fourth puzzle for the Green heart is here!\nThe fifth puzzle for the Blue heart is here!\nThe sixth puzzle for the Indigo heart is here!\nThe seventh puzzle for the Violet heart is here!\nTo get each badge, go to this submission site, pull down to the right candy heart color, and enter the animal you find in the blank. You can use the badges as your social media icon on Facebook, Twitter, or Kickstarter. In fact, we\u2019d really like it if you did!\nHere are the badges without their candy heart messages. \nOf course, you don\u2019t know your secret admirer\u2019s identity \u2014 it wouldn\u2019t be much of a secret otherwise, naturally. To find out your admirer\u2019s name, you\u2019ll need to solve all seven mini-crosswords and follow the metapuzzle instructions to get your eighth badge, the Rainbow badge.

So, shortly after the campaign ends, we\u2019ll be able to send it through an editing pass and then send it to press.

When you\u2019re invited inside for an evening\u2019s entertainment, what could possibly go wrong? Will you Cuddle with Cats or Thwart a Thief? Will you Brawl Over Brandy or Fall Prey to the Plague? At Hemlock Hall, awful amusements become deadly diversions with the flip of a card.\nGloomier: A Night at Hemlock Hall is a darkly humorous stand-alone competitive storytelling card game for two to five players. To win, you make your characters suffer the greatest tragedies possible before passing on to the well-deserved respite of death.  The player with the most negative score wins. And in Gloomier, the winner gets the final word: Who was the murderer? How did the heist end? You decide!\nGloomier features transparent plastic cards, allowing a character\u2019s score \u2014 and story \u2014 to evolve as cards are stacked on top of each other. You don\u2019t need prior experience to play Gloomier, but Gloom fans will find that A Night at Hemlock Hall expands the storytelling aspect of Gloom with new, specially-designed story prompts. And this full stand-alone game includes 6 new Stories and 14 new Guests that can be used with any edition of Gloom. So dare to enter Hemlock Hall, and see what delightful disaster awaits!\n\nLike all Gloom games, Gloomier: A Night at Hemlock Hall is a storytelling game. Stack transparent cards to boost your score and make your characters\u2019 tales the most tragic \u2014 while blighting opponents with good fortune. Then, tell the story of these miserable misanthropes.\nWhen you play an Untimely Death card on a character, they die and their negative score is locked in, but the story continues until all of one player\u2019s characters have perished. Then, all players tally their scores.The player whose characters had the most tragic lives (and the most negative score) is the winner.\nPoints are important, but the best part of Gloomier: A Night at Hemlock Hall is building increasingly sad, and increasingly silly stories with your fellow players. If you like Nightmare Before Christmas, The Addams Family, or A Series of Unfortunate Events, we think you\u2019ll enjoy the absurd dark humor of Gloomier.\n\nGloomier: A Night at Hemlock Hall contains:\n 110 transparent plastic cards (including 14 new Guests, 6 Story cards, a new cast of Characters, and a variety of new Modifier, Event, and Untimely Death cards to bolster your tragic tales)\nA 12-page, color, totally redesigned rulebook \nAn attractive tuckbox \nIt\u2019s a standalone expansion, which means you can play it by itself or combine it with any other Gloom games.\n\nGloom fans have been asking for it for years, and it\u2019s finally here \u2026 a box big enough for all your Gloom games!\nThe luxurious Grief Case is large enough to hold every Gloom game produced thus far \u2014 that\u2019s roughly 1500 Gloom cards \u2014 plus all your rules and extras, and your darkest secrets. (It\u2019s even got room to accommodate another four full Gloom games or eight expansions, for when you add future Gloom games to your collection.)\nThis case is extremely sturdy! 4mm thick laminated chipboard will make this the strongest game box in your collection, sure to hold up to a lifetime of use. Or, of course, 'til Untimely Death.\n Soft Touch finish adds a luxurious velvety-soft texture for instant tactile appeal and resistance to fingerprint marks. It also makes sliding the lid off the box both quick and satisfying.\n Spot gloss and red metallic foil add texture and shine to highlight design elements.\nThis deluxe box comes with its own thick acrylic dividers, so you can sort and cross-reference your games and cards in whatever way makes the most sense to you.\nAnd more! Follow our backer updates for behind-the-scenes looks while we finalize production.\ndesign subject to change\nAnd don\u2019t worry, if you\u2019re missing a few Gloom games, we\u2019ve made them all available as add-ons for this campaign so you can easily complete your collection!\n\n\nLots of Kickstarter campaigns (including several of ours!) have lots of different stretch goals to unlock. For this Kickstarter, we\u2019re focusing on just one big one: The Gloom Chronicles. Chronicles is an expansion for the Gloom series, turning Gloom into a serialized, campaign-style game. It is included with all pledge levels, and has been improved through stretch goals to be the best The Gloom Chronicles it can be!\nIn Gloom, you and your friends weave tales of woe. But where does the story begin? Each card in The Gloom Chronicles expansion starts a new chapter for an ongoing game of Gloom, ties those games together as a serialized campaign, and adds variant rules, bringing new challenges to the story. You can choose a card at random, or you can start from the beginning and explore the ongoing chronicle of your family through an extended campaign. Your story begins with the Unhappy Birthday \u2026 but will your next game of Gloom involve a Tragic Train Ride, or will you end up at the infamous World\u2019s Unfair?\nThe Gloom Chronicles is an expansion that can enhance any game of Gloom. You can use it with just one Gloom game, or let it navigate you through all the expansions. Narrative prompts give players a unified foundation for their stories, while variant rules challenge new and experienced players alike. The Unhappy Birthday awaits! What ignominious ending will your Gloom Chronicle have?\n\nAll pledge levels receive a discount on the entire Gloom line of products to complete your collection.\n The stretch goals for this campaign improved and expanded The Gloom Chronicles to its best version!

You will choose the language of your rewards during the pledge manager phase [suivez ce lien pour toutes les infos en fran\u00e7ais !]\nEncyclopedia Standard Edition included in the $40 reward tier\nEncyclopedia in a Nutshell\nEncyclopedia is a 360-page lore book for your 5th Edition campaign, including dozens of ready-to-use cities, locations, NPCs, plot hooks, and magic items for your next game session.\n As a game master, you have a lot to do. Planning, writing, sometimes drawing, and much more!  We've been GMs for over 20 years and we are here to help. With this book, we wanted to offer you as much material as possible to make your job as a GM easier. Prepare your next game session or upgrade your worldbuilding by picking from the Encyclopedia\u2019s rich contents and cook up your own unforgettable stories!\nEncyclopedia Red Dragon Deluxe Edition included in the $70 reward tier and up\nDownload a 40-page Preview of the Encyclopedia\nTo download the 40-page preview of the Encyclopedia, click the following link. If you like what you see, back us to allow us to create more :)\nWork on the Encyclopedia started in France in 2016. It took our studio four years to put together the 360 pages and hundreds of artworks depicting the cities, places, magic items, and NPCs within. The book is now translated and in the very last steps of proofreading and formatting for PDF. We plan to deliver a final version of the Encyclopedia PDF at the end of the campaign.\nCities and Places of Adventure\nAcross this book, you will find 15 cities and many locations ready to serve as the settings of your next adventures. Each of these places has its own identity, featuring many adventure hooks and dozens of memorable figures, both friends and foes: a kobold mining village, a diabolist city, a necropolis-city, a hobgoblin pirate port, and more! The Free City, described over 40+ pages, is split into 15 districts, which you can use separately, as the locales of urban adventures, or as part of a teeming metropolis.\nThis toolbox is perfect for veteran game masters who want to level up their homebrew campaign, as well as for beginners seeking readily usable content to begin their first campaign. This book can also be used as a campaign setting to play in a universe steeped in Sword & Sorcery and portraying colorful civilizations.\n\nLevel-up Your Next Story\nEncyclopedia offers colorful and diverse game material spanning 4 civilizations, each highly distinct from the others. Every one has its own atmosphere, its own mysteries, and its own antagonists.\nA meditating orc of the Iruuls - Available as a playable species in CREATURES\nOne of our main objectives was to step away from the tropes of classic fantasy, where orcs and other 'greenskins' are brutish and inherently evil. Here, orcs have cultures of their own, including pacifistic ones like the Iruul orcs, and hobgoblins have a thriving culture of trading.\n\nCoat of arms of the Garden City\nYou can draw inspiration from these civilizations or use them as-is in a campaign of your creation\u2026 or you can feature them in the setting of Eana, which gathers them all!\n Free City. Join the guilds and schemes of the Free City, a cosmopolitan metropolis filled with many mysteries!\n Drakenbergen. Discover legendary valleys with hidden ancient ruins, majestic fjords, dwarven mines, raging volcanoes, and the vampiric kingdom of Kentigern, all nestled in the sprawling mountains of the Drakenbergen!\n Septentrion. Sail for faraway Bore\u00efa, the gateway to the Septentrion, and explore these frozen northern lands, populated with fearsome frost giants and holding a portal to the frozen plane of Gemoniae!\n Kaan. Ride across the steppes of Kaan, venturing into baroque, contrasted, thriving, decadent city-states. Barter with the pirates of Tili\u2019s Gulf or the shrewd merchants of Lihy\u00e2n as you bear witness to past, present, and future empires!\nA traveling hobgoblin merchant - Available as a playable species in CREATURES\nEncyclopedia is your new cookbook for your next game sessions ^^\nMagic Items\nEncyclopedia includes more than fifty magic items. Each is tied to one of the locations or personalities described in the book, providing adventure hooks and springboards for new adventures.\nYou will also find 5 optional rules to customize the use of magic items in your campaign:\n Enchanted gems. Set magic gems in weapons and armor to grant them special, unique properties!\n Magic weapon sheaths. Keep the destructive power of your weapons under control with suitable sheaths.\n War paints. In preparation for battle, draw from the ancestral might of these magic Kaani war paints.\n Magic pearls. Discover the pearls of the stone giants, which enable them to go unnoticed!\n Progressive mirafaction. Under the influence of fate and the extreme energies they are subjected to, the personal belongings of adventurers can gradually become magic items. What used to be a fine sword, a family legacy, progressively turns into a more fearsome weapon, imbued with enchantments that will become manifest at key moments of the adventurer\u2019s tribulations!\nModular System\nEncyclopedia makes use of a modular system that lets each game leader define the atmosphere they wish to create for their stories. Each of the symbols listed below indicates related optional rules, adventures hooks, and setting elements that the leader can choose to make use of within a given campaign. Do you want your game to fit the canons of heroic fantasy? Use the rules labeled \u201cAction\u201d to make the adventurers all the more powerful and successful. Do you want to play a dark-fantasy, survival-oriented game? \u201cDark\u201d and \u201cGritty\u201d options have been designed for you and will give adventurers a hard time. \nModular System Icons\nHere are three examples: \n Action. This icon indicates all the rules, magic items, and situations that offer epic options and emphasize the characters\u2019 feats and achievements.\n Corruption. The Corruption icon shows situations and magic items that lead to corruption, or which are only relevant to a corrupted creature.\n Dark. The optional rules, magic items, and situations indicated by this icon are all related to horror, madness, or corruption.\nSpice up your next campaign!\nStretch Goals!\nThe base goal will support the book\u2019s printing. Beyond that, we have several bonuses and upgrades planned to thank you for your support. To ensure a reasonable delivery schedule, all the bonuses of this campaign have already been designed. Your support will enable us to manufacture them and, most of all, send them to backers at no extra charge! Most of the bonuses unlocked during this campaign will be available later (late pledge) but will then become paid options. \nWith your support, we can keep the Fateforge series growing.
