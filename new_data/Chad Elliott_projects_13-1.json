[{"backer": "Chad Elliott", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Avey Grouws Band: \"Tell-Tale Heart\" Kickstart(er)\nYou all know what this last year has been like, and Kickstarter is telling me to be brief. So first, let us just say thank you! And second, we're so excited about this next album! \nWhen we released \"The Devil May Care\" on March 20, 2020, we had no idea what lay ahead. On that day we went into pandemic shut down and lost over a year of touring and revenue. But we adapted and grew, managing to do over 100 live streams from the apartment, getting the album out to the public, hitting #10 on the Billboard Blues Chart, being nominated for multiple industry awards and songwriting competitions, hitting charts across the globe, managing to wind up on an array of \"Best of 2020\" album and song charts (even hitting #1 spots on a few of them?!) and, best of all, expanding our friend/fan base to new folks around the world. Yes, it absolutely was a difficult year for us all....but it was also a year of renewal, growth and learning.\n\"Tell-Tale Heart\" was born of this strangely difficult but beautiful time. The 10 tracks were all written during this past year and they are full of reality. They reflect the good times and the bad, the joy and the tears. They tell stories of life in a way that feels 100% us. Blues, Roots, Rock, Americana, all mixing to form the AGB sound you know. We can't wait for you to hear it and we can't wait to share this with the larger world!\nIn April, we headed down to Nashville to record with Grammy winning engineer/producer, Casey Wasner (Keb' Mo', Taj Mahal, Robben Ford), spending much of the first week at the super vibey East Iris Recording Studios in Berry Hill, this tiny town inside of Nashville. This place was not only visually and creatively appealing, but it also had all of the space we needed to record together as a band and get the sound we wanted. That was the most important thing for us on this album.\nEast Iris...what a place to record!\nThe hall separating The Cave (mixing room) from the Sun Room, a replica of Sun Studios in Memphis. As the vocalist, Jeni had her own suite. Ooh la la!\nCasey Wasner (left) and Ross Collier (right) worked hard to get the sound just right and yet somehow stayed totally chill the entire time. Love these guys. Note: You can see the Sun Room behind them in the window.\nAfter we recorded all 10 tracks at East Iris, we spent the next couple of weeks working on the mix at The Purple House in Leiper's Fork, TN. The Purple House is Casey Wasner's studio out in the Tennessee hills, and it couldn't have been a better place for us to not only spend the time we needed to mix the album, but also for us to learn. It's clear that Casey has absorbed so much in his time touring on drums with Keb' Mo', on guitar with Robben Ford and in all of his efforts in the studio with various artists. Lucky for us, he passed bits of that knowledge on to us during the mixing experience and we are definitely better musicians because of that time. And even more importantly, the album was given the attention it deserved during these 2 weeks.  We can't wait for you to hear \"Tell-Tale Heart\", and we really can't wait to share it with the greater music community.\nChris Avey plays on Robben Ford's guitar at The Purple House while Casey Wasner works on the mix.\nBryan West, Casey Wasner, Jeni Grouws and Chris Avey on wrap day!\n Here's where we need you! The album is recorded. But we need to get it out there and the only way we can do that is to get some of these expenses covered by selling you fun stuff! While you are welcome to simply make a donation, our real opportunity here is to give you the chance to support this album before its release date by purchasing different reward levels offered in this Kickstarter. From pre-releases of the album and T-shirts, to drum lessons and house parties, it's all here! This is the only way that you will be able to get the album before anyone else....and if it's a hardcopy, we'll sign it for you, too! In addition, Kickstarter allowed us to offer Add Ons, so you can support at one level and then click an add on to also get a t-shirt, or a coozie, or a sticker without having to support two separate levels. It's very cool and very exciting!\nIf you are interested in finances, this album is going to cost around $25,000. We are still an independent band. We do not have the support of a label with an entire team working to push this album forward, though a second album like this could help us find that support in the future! Between studio booking, mixing time, producer costs, mastering, printing, travel expenses including food and lodging, marketing, PR photos, hiring a publicist, album art, kickstarter taxes, etc, it all adds up pretty quickly. Since we couldn't tour the last album, we didn't sell the amount of merch that we hoped to sell to help pay for this album. We have covered a little over 11k ourselves. We are keeping our campaign to $16,000 (of the $25,000 project) because over $2,000 of that goes toward kickstarter fees, processing fees and taxes and the $14,000 will go toward covering the rest of our expenses on this album. If we do go over our goal, we may be able to make a music video! But we're not getting greedy, we just want to make our goal. And hopefully we have some great rewards here that will get you excited about helping us get this album out to the world!\nWe have worked hard, pushed through and are ready to give this album wings, but we can't do it without you. We say it all the time, but truly, we are so grateful that you are there for us. The journey ahead is going to be exciting. Thank you for traveling with us!\nLove, Avey Grouws Band\nChris Avey, Bryan West, Randy Leasman, Nick Vasquez and Jeni Grouws\nDuring a break at East Iris Studios. We were tired, a bit haggard and super happy to be there!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis biggest risk here is that we don't reach $16,000. Kickstarter has a policy that, if it's not fully funded by the deadline, then we don't get any of the money and you get refunded your investment. You can help us by sharing this and by telling everyone you know about this album so that they, too, can get their pre-release album. They don't have to think of it as a donation, just a pre-release purchase, but it really does help us on this end of things.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 12 or more", "title": "Pre-Release Digital Download", "descp": "Get your own pre-release digital download of the new album \"Tell-Tale Heart\"!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Aug 2021"}], "stat": ["20 backers", "Add-ons"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 15 or more", "title": "Ltd Edition \"Tell-Tale Heart\" Poster", "descp": "Get our first Avey Grouws Band poster!

Avey/Grouws Band finally made our debut album!\nThe Devil May Care will be independently released in March of this year. 10 tracks, all original music that came from our hearts and our souls. Iowa musicians, recorded at Catamount Recording in Cedar Falls, Iowa, with original linocut and digital artwork created by Iowa artist, Nick Hirka and album layout crafted by Iowa graphic designer, Deb Paulson. Yes, we could've gone to record somewhere else and worked with folks from across the country. But we wanted to keep our work, and our money, as local as possible. There is talent all around these Heartland states and we wanted to showcase them as well!\nWell the project is finally done and it has exceeded our expectations! We can't wait for you, our family, friends and fans, to hear it. Recently, we've had conversations with people much wiser than we are, and they all  ask the same thing: If you've put together this terrific album, why not get it the attention it deserves? It's a fair question. This album needs to go beyond our usual touring radius. It has the chance to do well if the right people hear it. But that can get expensive. When we started this process, we did not want to ask for help and we were able to get the album completed. But we had no idea how much money really does go into writing, recording, mixing, mastering, producing and then promoting and marketing an album to the right people. So here we are, ready to release a promising album, but we're stuck. We need your help to get this album to the next level!\nThe basics facts are: We are looking at a minimum of $6,000 to get the publicity, and the publicist, that we need. So we are asking to reach that minimum with our kickstarter. If we go over, please know that it will all go towards marketing this album.\nWe're proud Midwesterners, so please note: This is not a donation. We are asking you to look at our offerings, including ordering pre-release cds, exclusive t-shirts, flash drives, parties and more, and see if there is something you might be interested in investing in to support us. We know you're excited and lovely and generous, but we want to be sure you get value in return! \nIf ever we were going to make a dent in the wider music scene, this is the time. But we can't do it alone. As our community of friends, we know you're excited for us, too, and for that we are truly grateful. So take a look and do what you can. Every single one of you that is able to support in some way, at any level, makes a giant difference in the end! So see what you can do, help us if you can and, if you REALLY want to go above and beyond, share the HECK out of this on social media. You never know who might be in a position to support new music.\nThank you. Thank you for having confidence in us, for dancing with us, for crying with us, for the gestures, big and small, for enjoying our music, giving us food and feedback and for sharing a toast with us now and again. This journey is so much more than those of us in the band. You are a part of it with us and we wouldn't have it any other way.

Bowen for these words:  'The mix of mid-western muscle and southern charm is reflected in the passionate, powerful and playful music of the band\u2019s debut full-length album, \u201cThe Devil May Care.\u201d The ten original tracks were written by the dynamic duo of Jeni Grouws and Chris Avey. Grouws has an alto that can blow like a cool breeze or thunder like a Kansas tornado, and Avey is a skilled guitarist that has drawn quick comparisons to Coco Montoya and Robben Ford...... The depth and strength of this strong debut, \u201cThe Devil May Care,\u201d should garner national attention for the group of musicians, who are the pride of the Quad Cities and well represent the talent grown in that area of the Mississippi Valley.'

YOU receive the new music before the album is officially released in Summer 2019, as well as access to special bonus offerings. In turn, your support allows us to launch this project and fund a publicity campaign so that this music may be heard by a wider audience. As the music industry has largely shifted to online streaming outlets, music sales have greatly declined...so, your support is now more important than ever. \nWe hope this new music inspires you, incites positive change, and allows space for reflection, tears, dancing, shedding of old skin, and that it keeps you and yours in good company. As our community of supporters, you have kept us on the road as independent musicians, and we are forever grateful to you for believing in what we do over all these years. This relationship between us is really what this is all about. We've put everything we have into this new album on our own, and now we're asking for you to join us in helping to get this music out into the world! \n(photo by Laura Totten Photography)\nNEW NAME\nSince 2010 we've been touring steadily throughout the U.S. and Europe as \"Dave McGraw & Mandy Fer\" and have recently changed our band name to - \"SWAY WILD!\" Over the last couple of years, we've done a lot of soul-searching. We even took a brief moment away from the road to breathe a little deeper and find some stillness. During that time, something beautiful cracked open, and music began flowing through us like we'd never experienced before. Mandy, with her fingers inseparable from the electric guitar, tapped into her muse, her inner wild perhaps, and out came more songs than we could even keep track of. Dave returned to his native instrument of the drums, and longtime friend and bassist Thom Lord moved into the neighborhood and rejoined the venture with contagious enthusiasm.\nTogether, we began collaborating and writing in entirely new ways.\nBut it is still very much us. \nUs growing. \nWe\u2019re giddy with an almost childlike enthusiasm about all of this and the new material feels so fresh, invigorating, and fun. It only seems right to mark this new growth with a new name. We are now Sway Wild.\nNEW ALBUM\nSway Wild (the name of the band and the new album!) captures this growth and is the culmination of everything we've been working on for the last two years. Between early December, 2018 and mid February, 2019 we traveled back and forth from our home of San Juan Island, WA to Portland, OR where we recorded at the beautiful and historic Hallowed Halls recording studio (formerly a public library from 1919-1972!) We had the opportunity to record with engineer-extraordinaire Justin Phelps, whose resume speaks for itself (see below). Credentials aside, Justin was eternally positive, enthusiastic (adequately caffeinated), incredibly talented, and hard-working. We spent an entire planetary season with him sculpting this record and bringing it to life together. He truly cared, and it shows.  \nWith Justin at the helm, we assembled a team of some of the finest musicians we've ever had the honor to work with. \nTHE TEAM                                             \n                                                             GUEST MUSICIANS\n Anna Tivel: violin, vocals\n Anthony Meade (MarchFourth, Sepiatonic): trombone, horn arrangements\n Paul 'Pablo' Chandler (MarchFourth, Orgone): trumpet\n Jon VanCura (MarchFourth): baritone & tenor saxophone\n Skip VonKuske (Portland Cello Project): cello\n Allison Russell (Birds of Chicago, Songs of our Native Daughters): vocals\n JT Nero (Birds of Chicago): vocals\n Anna Fritz (Bizarre Stars): cello\n Sean Hayes: vocals\n                                                         RECORDING & MIXING ENGINEER\n Justin Phelps, Portland, OR.

Your overwhelming support left us immensely grateful and deeply inspired. Maritime received press recognition in both the U.S. and Europe that gave us a real lift in our trajectory....all thanks to you! \nNow, with your involvement in this project for Sway Wild, we're aiming even higher in order to expand the reach and sustainability of this music. We are going to keep working hard, and these goals below help us to do so to the best of our abilities.\nGOALS\nOUR INITIAL GOAL: $26,000\n If we do not reach 26,000 in 30 days, your cards will not be charged and we will not receive any money.  If we do reach this initial goal, this will allow us to cover the costs of recording, mixing, and mastering of the album. (Costs listed below) We've listed stretch goals below in hopes to give this new album a shot at really being a success...Thank you!\nOUR FIRST STRETCH GOAL: $32,000\nwill cover above + manufacturing + allow for a bare-minimum publicity campaign. Thank you!\n OUR SECOND STRETCH GOAL: $40,000 and above\nWe can make the best album possible, but if it isn't given wings it will never take off.\nThis goal will allow us to hire a NATIONAL PUBLICITY team/firm to increase our chances of catching an ear at major outlets such as NPR, Rolling Stone, etc...as well as helping to secure song placements on influential streaming playlists...These outlets would not only help our music reach a wider audience, but also contribute to our ability to expand our support team with well-established folks in the music biz who can provide more opportunities for growth/exposure.\nThis goal will allow for VIDEO production. Videos are invaluable to booking and promotion. You watch videos on the internet, right?! This is one of the most effective ways to expand our community and maintain the connection between our music and our listeners.\nThis goal will allow for effective TOUR PROMOTION which gets more people to our shows.\nThis goal may allow for a small RADIO campaign.\nThank you for believing that our music is worthy of greater exposure!\n COSTS: \nThe financial realities of producing/releasing/promoting a professionally recorded album require some pretty heavy lifting. The costs for making Sway Wild include:\nEquipment Rental \nStudio Rental \nEngineering/Mixing/Production \nPaying musicians \nTransportation\nAccommodations/travel expenses\nAlbum artwork, layout, and design\nMastering\nManufacturing CDs/Vinyl\nDistribution\nPublicity/Promotional campaign\nVideography \nKickstarter fees/mailings\n\nSONGS:\n Below are a couple of teasers from the new album...

The MUSIC in digital download form will be delivered to you before the official US/EU release date sometime this summer! (exact release date tbd ) House Concerts, poetry books, special song compositions, vinyl etc.. will take a bit longer and we will coordinate with you individually to meet your hopes/needs for these rewards as best we can.\nVarious Kickstarter Offerings\nRecording at Hallowed Halls", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nMusic is in our bones.

I am honored to announce that I have the special opportunity to make a new, full-length record with one of the most in-demand producers in Austin, legendary troubadour, Walt Wilkins.\nMost of you know my story - how meeting artist/producer Ray Bonneville at an airport changed my life and started my second career as a singer-songwriter following a 21-year career in the Marine Corps. The release of my debut album, Silver Line in 2015 sent me on an amazing, unexpected journey. I\u2019m grateful and humbled to have had the opportunity to work with some incredibly gifted artists, many of whom have been my music heroes for a very long time. Lifelong friends I\u2019ve made along the way include folks I\u2019ve been privileged to share the stage with and many who occupy the most important seats in the house, the audience - you.\nClockwise, from top left: Chuck with Matt Harlan & Adam Carroll at Gruene Hall; Chuck & Libby Koch; Chuck with Ray Bonneville & Amber Cross; Chuck & Jon Napier; Chuck & Charlie Roth; Chuck with Michael Martin Murphey and band at the Saxon Pub in Austin\nI have done my very best to work hard and honor the opportunities that I\u2019ve been gifted. Over the past several years, I\u2019ve played countless shows in Central Texas, maintained a local residency hosting some of the most talented songwriters around, and toured the U.S. and Europe multiple times. Recently, I made my debut as a producer for Jim Wyly\u2019s critically-acclaimed album, The Artisan. Of all the things I get to do though, I am most proud to donate my time and energy to veteran\u2019s causes, especially Dustin Welch\u2019s Soldier Songs & Voices - a program dedicated to post-conflict care through free music and songwriting lessons to our veterans.\nClockwise, from top left: Jim Wyly's The Artisan; Chuck at the Soldier Songs & Voices Reveille Retreat; Chuck & George Ensle on the Kerrville Folk Festival Main Stage; Chuck with Libby Koch & Ordinary Elephant; Chuck & Ramblin' Jack Elliott; Chuck with Rob & Mark Ellen\nThis is what I\u2019m supposed to be doing; I believe that. My job is to write, to pick up a guitar and sing songs for you and, hopefully in doing so, make this place a little better or that thing a little easier. I need your help to continue down this path.  \nTHE NEW RECORD\nThis record will be a collection of songs where the words are up front & natural... Songs you may have heard live before and some new ones I can\u2019t wait for you to hear. The album will be recorded at Jumping Dog Studio in Austin with the talented Ron Flynt as the engineer. Walt will be bringing some of Austin\u2019s finest musicians into the studio to play on this album...you\u2019ll have to wait to find out which ones. I will be promoting the record in the U.S. and Europe for radio and press and current plans are to tour on both sides of the pond to support the release.\nThe Production Team - Ron Flynt, Chuck, and Walt Wilkins\nHOW KICKSTARTER WORKS & WHERE YOUR MONEY GOES\nIn the new music industry, Kickstarter has become one of the primary ways for independent artists to make records. It allows us to offer our community of friends and fans music, merch, and memories in exchange for your much-needed support. So, when you support this Kickstarter project, you\u2019re joining the production team. Together, we\u2019re going to make something special, and I can\u2019t wait to share it with you.  \nIf you\u2019re interested to know where the money goes on a professional recording project, below is a breakdown of our working budget to record, manufacture, and promote this album the absolute best we can: \nPRODUCTION (Studio, Musicians, Producer, & Mixing): $15,000\nMASTERING: $1,000\nARTWORK, GRAPHIC DESIGN, REBRANDING: $1,200\nCD MANUFACTURING: $4,000\nVIDEO PRODUCTION: $5,000\nRADIO PROMOTION, PR, PUBLICITY (U.S. & Europe; includes shipping): $10,000\nADVERTISING (Social Media & Print): $1,500\nMERCHANDISE & REWARD PRODUCTION: $2,000\nKICKSTARTER FEES (at $25K Goal): $2,500\nSHIPPING COSTS FOR KICKSTARTER REWARDS: $2,000\nObviously, this adds up to more than my goal of $25,000. However, a successfully funded Kickstarter will ensure the maximum amount we need to produce the album and the minimum amount it will take to promote it. I will either cover the remaining costs or reduce promotional expenses accordingly. The more we make, the more we can promote this thing and get the music out to as many listeners as we can.\nKickstarter is an all-or-nothing platform, meaning if we don\u2019t meet the $25,000 goal, I won\u2019t get any funds to produce the album. Even if you can't contribute your hard-earned money, I'd ask that you please share this campaign with your friends so we can get the word out.\nTHANK YOU!\nThis doesn\u2019t work without you: the venues don\u2019t stay open, the shows don\u2019t get played, the albums don\u2019t get made. I\u2019m deeply grateful for your support these past years and I hope you\u2019ll jump aboard my production team and help me make this record a reality.  \nThank you very much and Happy New Year!\nYours to a cinder,\nChuck", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWorking with a team like Walt Wilkins and Ron Flynt makes me confident that this is going to be a great record. There\u2019s some risk that unforeseen circumstances could delay the album\u2019s release once it\u2019s recorded, but your support of this Kickstarter will ensure that I\u2019ll have plenty of resources to get things done the right way.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 15 or more", "title": "Album Download", "descp": "Get an early download of Chuck\u2019s new record as soon as it is ready!\nINCLUDES:\nNew Album - Download", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Apr 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["24 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 25 or more", "title": "Signed CD", "descp": "You\u2019ll get your CD hot off the press - hand signed by Chuck and delivered prior to the release date.\nINCLUDES:\nNew Album - Signed CD\nNew Album - Download", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Apr 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["61 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 35 or more", "title": "Signed CD Special - Personalized Package", "descp": "Upgrade to this level and your signed CD will include a Chuck Hawthorne sticker and personal thank you note from Chuck.\nINCLUDES:\nNew Album - Signed CD\nChuck Hawthorne Sticker\nNew Album - Download\nPersonal Thank You Note", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Apr 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["20 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 50 or more", "title": "T-Shirt", "descp": "Super soft, new Chuck Hawthorne t-shirt design that will only be available to Kickstarter supporters!
