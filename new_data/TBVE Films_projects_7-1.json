[{"backer": "TBVE Films", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "* This represents our current thinking, and may change as development and playtesting proceed.\nKingdoms and Warfare introduces Domain-level play to your game, allowing players to become Regents running a Kingdom, Duchy, or Barony! Or a Church! A Thieves\u2019 Guild! A Bard\u2019s College! Whichever you choose, it\u2019s your Domain. Your domain can take actions, raise armies, conduct espionage, and wage war!\nDifferent kinds of Domains have access to different actions. A Thieves\u2019 Guild is quite good at espionage, not so good at raising armies. So you may need allies! Because you will certainly have enemies!\nCharacters are still adventurers! But now the stakes are higher. Now the dragon threatens your people! And the dungeon contains the power you need to stop your enemies\u2019 schemes!\nWhile you\u2019re away; your Lieutenant runs your domain (by your command) allowing you to continue adventuring as normal. Or as normal as anything is in this game. :D\nThese new rules are broken down into three broad categories, described after the graphics below.\nThe Kickstater Exclusive Edition will have gold trim!\nThe text you see here will only be available for the  Kickstarter-exclusive shirt! We may make a future shirt with no back text, but for the Kickstarter, you get the exclusive Tour Shirt.\nAlso available as a $25 add-on in the pledge manager.\nAnd it comes in a red variant!\n Kingdoms, duchies, baronies, earldoms, any territory with people living on it can be your Domain. Domains can be a small province with a single town, or a sprawling kingdom with many cities. This book contains rules for starting with a single province and growing your domain, or starting the game at 1st level by inheriting an entire kingdom!\nThe system assumes that, regardless of how many different domains your campaign world might have, we\u2019re only worried about one Enemy Domain, one Allied Domain, and one Neutral Domain who could go either way. This constrains the number of things the GM needs to worry about so we don\u2019t need a computer to track all the different actors in our play. Of course, an ambitious GM could track more Kingdoms!\nDomain actions allow you to muster new units for your army, develop your land to get more resources out of it, build roads to make it easier to get around for people and armies, spy on your enemies, and ally with your neighbors.\nThe book includes rules and advice for running campaigns where only one player is a regent, all players are regents, or even how to use these rules to track the high-level politics in a game where no players are regents, and you just want the feel of large-scale political powers maneuvering against each other.\nNot every player wants to run a duchy or an earldom, but these rules give you many more kinds of Domains! Existing within, alongside, and sometimes at odds with a Kingdom, are Organizations like Churches, Thieves\u2019 Guilds, Wizard Orders, Bardic Colleges and more. All of them get special Domain Actions that affect the outcome of The Great Game.\nPaladin Order: The Green\nWizard's Order: The Arcanum Camerata\nAssassins College: Nine Silver\nOne player might run a thieves\u2019 guild, but sometimes the entire group wishes they could play a thieves\u2019 guild! Or an order of Monks! But while \u201clet\u2019s all play monks!\u201d sounds cool, once you sit down and think about it you realize that would mean no healing, no tank, no tracker, no one to pick locks or disarm traps or read arcane scrolls unless someone multiclasses, and was not as good at being a monk as everyone else, or played a different class and pretty soon you\u2019re back to playing a normal adventuring partzzzz\u2026..\nMaybe there\u2019s a better way.\nKingdoms and Warfare expands on the rules presented in the Chain of Acheron livestream with Titles for several different organizations.\nTitles give your characters new, limited abilities and proficiencies that let them shore up the deficiencies of a limited-class party.\nA thieves\u2019 guild might have a Godbotherer, a thief who gains proficiency with Religion and limited healing and possibly limited access to prayers. Not as powerful or useful or versatile as a cleric, but it gets the job done.\nAn order of Monks might have an Acolyte of Mystery, who gains proficiency with Arcana and access to limited spells. Or an Acolyte of Stone with increased AC and HP!\nOf course, some titles cannot be conferred during character creation, and must be earned like the Master of Ravens, the Master of Locusts, and the rest of the Monk Masters.\nExpanded rules for Warfare allowing faster, more balanced battles, more and different kinds of units. Pikemen who thwart Cavalry charges! Sappers who undermine fortifications! And more and better rules for Battle Magic; spells that affect units and the entire battlefield.\nNew Maneuvers allow characters to directly command their units, executing daring ploys that can change the course of war!\nNew rules for the Tide of Battle create a connection between the Encounter your characters are fighting and the Battle your units are waging. Doing well in the Encounter gives your army a boost! Doing well in Battle gives your characters an advantage! Of course, doing poorly has similarly predictable results\u2026.\nNew rules for using PCs and monsters as units, as well as more advice for building an army and waging war. The rules for Warfare in Strongholds & Followers are only the beginning of a more robust system.\nStrongholds & Followers  does not require the use of Kingdoms and Warfare; both strongholds and followers give players cool new abilities and allies all by themselves. But combining the two products produces a deeper system for running a world where characters can become Dukes or start their own Church, or run their own Thieves\u2019 Guild.\nWe listened to folks who bought Strongholds & Followers and made sure to put more of what they liked into Kingdoms & Warfare.\nNew Gemstone dragons! New servitors from each of the Courts presented in S&F and three new courts! The Court of Seven Cities (Devils), the Court of Blood (Demons) and the Court of Rot (Undead!) More better things to augment your concordance roll!\nThe monster design from S&F was pretty popular and we\u2019re super excited to do more. \nPLAY\n\nPeople loved the codicies from the first book, so we\u2019re doing more! The Codex Granatine! The Codex Adamant! The Codex Tempestatus! These legendary artifacts will change, or break, your game. Use at your peril!\nIncluding the legendary Codex Bellorum...the BOOK OF WAR.\nAny book of new rules as big as this requires an adventure to show you how to use it. The Regent of Bedegar acts as a sequel to the Siege of Castle Rend and introduces players to Domain Level play. The heroes manage their new domain, putting out fires in Gravesford and other local towns while encountering various organizations in Aendrim, some friendly, some not so much.\nOf course, there will be a battle at the end! Lord Saxton must pay for what he\u2019s done!\nLike Strongholds & Followers, this book uses my setting\u2019s background and lore, so you\u2019ll learn more about the Timescape, the lore of demons, devils, and undead, and more fiction featuring the young adventurers from the first book.\nAnd a Dragon!\nFolks really liked the gemstone dragons from the first kickstarter, so we're doing another one. The Ancient Onyx Dragon Cthrion Uroniziir!\nThis mini is BIG and only available to folks who back this Kickstarter. It will be available as an add-on in our Pledge Manager, but only to folks who pledge!\nIt\u2019s not \u201cCiv.\u201d It doesn\u2019t simulate an elaborate 4X game, it doesn\u2019t worry about stuff like...how much Iron you produce vs how much Wheat you need. Provinces produce \u201cresources.\u201d Alliances just boost those resources.\nIn general these rules focus on high-level play, heavily abstracted, married to crunchy rules that give your characters real mechanical benefits. If you\u2019re looking for a simulation this is not it.\nThe goal is; you\u2019re still playing Fifth Edition, but now your campaign has an extra dimension.\nIf we manage to reach our funding goal, we have a whole bunch of stretch goals planned. The book stays the same, but we unlock new play aids like a GM's Screen and a deck of unique unit cards for your fantasy warfare needs. \n The MCDM Screen\nA 4-panel screen for the discerning game master to fudge die rolls behind. Without a screen, you\u2019re just another random person at the table. With the screen, you become THE MASTER!\nOur screen gives you easy access to tables from Strongholds, Followers, Kingdoms, and Warfare including the list of Domain Actions, Random Domain Events, as well as the full list of actions that adjust your Concordance, making it easier to track.\nThe Unit Deck\nDozens of unique units with custom special abilities to use in your epic battles! Centaur shock troops! Goblin sappers! Beholder units! Dragon units! All printed on high-quality cards ready to be used immediately at your table.\n Dope Minis\nWe have a bunch of new monsters planned for Kingdoms & Warfare and we'd love to make minis out of all of them! Each stretch goal pays for the 3D model and the manufacturing mold. As we unlock new ones...IF we unlock new ones...you'll get to see the art and lore and how big the mini will be an how much it will cost. You'll be able to upgrade your pledge in our pledge manager to add any of the minis you like to your pledge.\nCheck back to see what (if anything!) gets unlocked!\n\nWe\u2019ll charge for shipping after the Kickstarter is over. We will collect this in the pledge manager.\nWe\u2019ll ship your rewards from one of the four Blackbox warehouses we work with. This project is US, Canada, and Australia friendly. Under current trade agreements, we are EU friendly. This may change pending future Brexit negotiations.\nBelow is a list of estimated shipping costs for the K&W Hardcover, PDF + Sticker pledge. Keep in mind that these are estimates and that the accurate costs will be calculated in the pledge manager according to your address, pledge level, and potential add-ons.\nWe don\u2019t ship to the following countries:\nAfghanistan, Brazil, Congo, Cote d\u2019Ivoire (Ivory Coast), Cuba, Democratic Republic of Congo, Eritrea, Guam, Guinea-Bissau, Haiti, Iran, Iraq, Liberia, Libya, Myanmar (Burma), North Korea, Russia, Somalia, South Africa, Sudan, Syria, Ukraine :(", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are many fewer risks associated with this product compared to Strongholds & Followers. We no longer print our books in China, so there\u2019s no danger of tariffs or trade interfering with our production. We have been through the Import Duty gauntlet so we have all the paperwork you need to ship your product around the world. We have good partners now, we know great artists, we have a great relationship with Trenchworx the folks who make our minis. \n\nLike Strongholds & Followers, these rules are based on rules I\u2019ve already designed before, so we\u2019re not creating an entire ruleset from whole cloth.\n\nI think probably the biggest risk is the fact that all of this revolves around me and my writing and design. Something happens to me, there could be a delay. But one of our goals with this project and the Player\u2019s Guide To Capital is finding other freelance writers and designers to work with under my direction so the product isn\u2019t wholly reliant on my labor.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 25 or more", "title": "Kingdoms & Warfare PDF", "descp": "Kingdoms & Warfare in an indexed, searchable PDF.

Ourselves and each other.  When I was young, if kids wanted to tease or bully you they either wrote notes, started whisper campaigns, or confronted you at lunch or in gym class.  The bullying seldom went beyond the extent of mere words.  Sticks and stones, but words could never...\nBut in today's generation, words have become weaponized.  Social media allows kids to hurls insults, lies, and harassment instantaneously.   Kids can be widely ridiculed, even sexually exploited with the touch of a send button.\nNot only are teens over-sharing their exploits about sex and hate, they are also normalizing drug and alcohol use without deeper understanding of the consequences.  \nAdd in abandonment, the discarded nature of a society, fiending for instant gratification where everything is replaceable - you get Emma Rae.

We're now over that! Since we still have time left in our campaign, we're able to go for a stretch goal. It's $24,500+ and any funds we raise towards or above that goal before our end date of 10/26/16 will go towards bettering our production and getting a head start on post production. THANK YOU VERY MUCH to everyone who has so generously supported us!\nBecause we hit our target goal, Kickstarter will release the funds to us once we reach our campaign end date of 10/26/16. There is no stipulation on our stretch goal like on the original goal...if we don't hit it, we'll still get our original $19,500 which was raised plus any additional funds. The additional funds will enable us to step up the look of the film, secure custom wardrobe and hair pieces, rent a second camera to shoot more efficiently, pay our editor to immediately begin assembling a rough cut and begin work on the film's soundtrack.\nThe Film\nREDCOATS is a dramatic short film with a comedic twist.\nSynopsis\nDuring the Revolutionary War, Emily, her daughter Sarah and her two young grandchildren, Hannah and William, are left to fend for themselves and care for the farm while the men in the family are off fighting for the Patriot cause. With winter approaching, crops dwindling and food in short supply, the women are forced to face their biggest fears when three lost British soldiers barge into their home demanding food, drink and anything else they can get their hands on. Emily and Sarah rely on their instincts and intelligence to devise a clever way to defend the children and themselves.\nThe Filmmakers\nMy sister Tammy and I (Amy) have been in the Film/TV business for 25 years each! Together we have 50+ years of experience working on documentaries, reality TV, short and feature films.\nHere's us as kids. Don't judge the clothes or the hair...it was the 70's.\nAmy, Tricia, Tammy\nOur parents are both repressed creatives. Mom is a real estate agent who wanted to be a journalist and played piano and sang as a kid, and Dad was an English teacher who played the trumpet and loved to tell a story. He was really good at it! We gained our love of a great story from both of them and talk movies and stories often in our house. Our younger sister Tricia is also creative and really the best writer we've ever known. She's doing real estate now too. Apparently being creative and selling houses go hand in hand?\nOur (Tammy and Amy) career paths have crossed twice. The first time we worked in the same building in Primos, PA called EJ Stewart. This was in the 90's when Tammy was working on a show, \"Home Matters,\" for the Discovery Channel and I (Amy) was working on a series of educational documentaries for a company, Fabian-Baber. This is where we met our talented cinematographer Keith Smith, who now has 50+ feature films under his belt. We honed our skills there then I moved to New York where I worked for HBO on shows such as The Chris Rock Show and the sketch show Exit 57. I also later worked as a post producer on reality TV shows for TLC and the Discovery Channel. Tammy moved to L.A. and attended the American Film Institute. While there, she won an Academy Award for her second year producing project called, \"My Mother Dreams The Satan's Disciples In New York,\" see Oscar win here. She was also a producer on several documentary specials for TLC and The Discovery Channel, but none of the same shows I worked on!\nThe second time our paths crossed we created a short film together for The 48 Hour Film Festival, Philadelphia, along with our other sister Tricia (a Tiehel trifecta!). The film was called, \"Suburban Cowboy,\" and won the Best Of Fest, Best Acting (I was the female lead), and Audience Award for the Festival.\nTammy at Tribeca Film Festival\n In the time since, Tammy has been raising her three children, producing short films and recently produced the romantic comedy, \"Slow Learners.\"\nAmy and her dad on the \"Amhurst\" red carpet\nI moved to Los Angeles and began an acting career. I did a feature horror film called \"Amhurst\", along with roles in other indie and short films. Then I got Lyme disease and breast cancer and moved back to Philly. My life was seriously detoured for seven years while I fought to regain my health. It's been a loooooong detour.\nWhile I was sick I focused on writing. I loved to write but didn't think of myself as a writer because my experience and training was in acting. I had taken acting classes in Philly, then in New York at Circle in the Square Theater School, and then more training in Los Angeles. But I couldn't act while I was sick as I didn't have the energy or stamina to audition or be on a set for long days. My body only allowed me to write and thus, with the encouragement of Tammy, emerged the short film REDCOATS.\nThe Genesis of REDCOATS\nI became interested in the stories of women during war, particularly the Revolutionary War. I googled \"women in the Revolutionary War.\" Lots of interesting stories popped up, so many that I was annoyed I hadn't heard of them nor had any films been made about any of these courageous and fascinating women. I read Revolutionary War books such as \"Drums Along the Mohawk,\" \"Revolutionary Mothers\" and \"Liberty's Daughters.\" Where were these stories when I was learning about the Revolutionary War in school? I was particularly interested in the story of Nancy Hart, a woman who was notorious in Georgia during that time for her bravery. Her story inspired me and a seed grew for my own short film idea.\nNancy Hart from Wikimedia\nThese women were isolated and lonely, and in my illness I connected deeply to their anxiety, fear and vulnerability. I also connected to and was inspired by their courage as they held on by any means necessary, just like me. This film is the physical representation of all those feelings I held in my soul while sick, and the perseverance it takes to survive.\nMy sister Tammy/film producer extraordinaire supported me along the way while the film was gestating. She encouraged me to be creative and think outside the box story-wise. With her feedback, I honed the script in my head for months then sat down and wrote it in a couple of days.\nOur Plan\nCrowdfunding didn't exist when we started our respective Film/TV careers. Now we have the ability, through crowdfunding and the experience after years in the business, to create something that provides opportunities for women in front of and behind the camera and for the many talented Philadelphia production people we know. (That's a long sentence). We are proud to create art that we believe in and that presents a positive, powerful woman's story.  \nYour contribution will help us defray the costs of pre-production, cover all of our production period and give us a head start on post production.  We plan to finance post through personal funds and are hopeful we can secure one or two grants.  We are currently applying for grants open to female filmmakers and the creators of short films.  \nIf we are lucky enough to exceed our Kickstarter goal of $19,500, we will use the money to help cover post production costs (video and sound editing, creating a soundtrack, sound effects, credits and output).  \nPre-production:  \nAugust - October 2016\n(Below items already completed as of launch of Kickstarter campaign)\nFinalized script\nCreated budget\nCreated LLC and opened business bank account\nCreated logo, crowdfunding site, web-site and social media campaign\nSecured location  \nConnected with Revolutionary War reenactors\nSecured film's soundtrack recording artists \nSecured film's audio post production vendor \nSecured Director of Photography\nIdentified camera, grip & lighting vendors\nIdentified field audio recordist\nReached out to potential crew members\nOctober - November 2016\nCasting of SAG actors \nSecuring crew \nFinalizing wardrobe\nWork with cinematographer to create shot list\nProduction:  November 19th and 20th, 2016 \nFilming at Colonial Pennsylvania Plantation, Ridley Creek State Park, Media, PA\nPost Production:  November 2016 - February 2017\nCreate rough cut of film\nRefine to create final cut\nAudio, SFX and foley editing\nCreate and lay in soundtrack\nCreate opening/end credits\nColor grading\nRendering/data transfer\nConform/finishing\nFirst round of deliverables\nMarketing/Distribution:  February 2017 - Ongoing\nFestival application submissions\nProduction Details\nColonial Pennsylvania Plantation\nLocation \nWe have secured the use of the Colonial Pennsylvania Plantation, a living history museum which includes a spacious three-story home with three fireplaces, a period accurate garden and a working farm.  Every room in the house is authentically dressed with furniture, tools, kitchen items and textiles from the Revolutionary War era which we are permitted to use in the film.\nReenactors' Muskets\n Casting \nProfessional Screen Actor's Guild actors will be cast in the roles of Emily, Sarah, Hannah, William and the three British Redcoat soldiers:  Enoch, Lemuel and James.\nIn addition, we have connected with Pennsylvania Revolutionary War reenactors who will play the role of Continental Army soldiers in one scene in the film. The men and women who dedicate themselves to Revolutionary War reenactment are experts in making sure uniforms, wardrobe and presentation are authentic to the period. Their input and participation is an invaluable addition to our film. \nColonial Era Hat\n Wardrobe \nWe are currently consulting with reenactors and Colonial Pennsylvania Plantation experts to be certain that all military uniforms and wardrobe will be authentic to the period.  We are looking into the possibility of either renting or buying certain wardrobe items but would be immensely grateful if anyone with access to Colonial era clothing would consider loaning us clothing, uniforms and/or shoes for the weekend we are shooting (11/19-11/20/16).  We will need to dress two women, a young girl, a young boy and three British Redcoat soldiers.  All items will be handled by an experienced wardrobe stylist and will be professionally cleaned and promptly returned.\nPeriod Authentic Military Uniforms\nHistorical accuracy \nWe consulted with a local historian and Revolutionary War expert, Paul Sanborn, and had him review the screenplay.  The script was then rewritten incorporating Paul's notes to ensure historical and military accuracy.  \n  Tammy and Amy on set\nWomen In Film\nAs a female writer/director and a female producer, it is our goal to create well-made, inspiring films featuring strong, smart, cool women.  In addition, we would like to provide opportunities for women behind the camera.  We have nothing against men...we LOVE men, in fact some of our favorite guys will be working on REDCOATS with us!  However, we really want to create a working environment which will allow women, especially female filmmakers who are just starting out, to shine.  \nSo far on our team, we're proud to introduce you to:\nEmilie van Blarcom\n Assistant to the Producers:  Emilie van Blarcom\nEmilie grew up in Ambler, PA and attended high school at Germantown Academy.  She is currently a junior at Elon University in North Carolina and is majoring in Film and Television Arts.  She hopes to minor in Creative Writing.  Emilie worked with us during the development of REDCOATS and was instrumental in helping us brainstorm ideas for our logo.  She also scouted locations with us and helped develop the Kickstarter campaign.  We're excited to have her on set with us when she's home from school in November.\nDevin Wachs\n Production Manager:  Devin Wachs\nAn experienced media professional, Devin has worked on feature film, music video, non-profit video, and television shoots. She also has nine years' experience promoting an art house movie theater, and she brings a keen understanding of the realities of film exhibition as well as marketing and project management techniques to her work. In addition to her film production work, she provides graphic design and marketing services to a diverse slate of clients and was pleased to design the REDCOATS logo.\nA Reminder About How KICKSTARTER Works\nKickstarter is an awesome platform for raising funds for any project!  Artists and creators share their projects and backers from all over the world can find and support projects they like. Instead of making what can (sometimes) be a risky investment in projects created by people they may not know, patrons donate funds in exchange for tangible rewards.  Everybody wins and through the power of crowd-funding, many wonderful projects are brought to fruition.  \nIt's important to note several things:\nKickstarter is an ALL OR NOTHING PLATFORM, if we only raise $19,000 of our $19,500 goal we get NOTHING!  It's motivational for us but whew, that's a bit scary!\nWhen you contribute to us through our page here on Kickstarter, you will be submitting your credit/debit card information but your card will NOT be charged unless the campaign is successful by the end date.

Washington Jr. @ThisIsMartinJr  and Maya Washington @shamelessmaya -- directed by @shazbennett.\nALASKA IS A DRAG is the darkly comic, achingly real story of LEO and his twin sister TRISTEN -- who long to be International Superstars but instead they are wading up to their knees in fish guts.\nEveryone who slices fish all day - daydreams. Leo's daydreams are just a little more glamtastic than most. Their father GEORGE works on a fishing boat. So they are left alone to fend for themselves. Tristen taught Leo how to fight to survive -- and unfortunately, Leo's regular tormentor and former best friend KYLE gives him a lot of practice. After one particularly brutal fight, Leo is recruited by the local boxing coach DIEGO to train with him. A new kid who just moved to town -- DECLAN -- becomes Leo's sparring partner -- and this new triangle forces the twins to face the real reason they're stuck in Alaska.\nIt's a fish out of water story -- literally -- it's Billy Elliot in reverse or Rocky in Drag. If Hedwig and Rocky had a love child that might best describe ALASKA IS A DRAG. \nWe're coming to YOU because we need your help to make this film!\nIf all of our fans and followers donated just $20 we could quadruple that $50K and we'd be over the moon! We're asking for the bare minimum but if we could double that, then we can bring this baby to light in all her fabulous glory! As it is, we are a tiny, intimate team. Which fits us and we will be bringing loads of behind the scenes and more of the story to YouTube through Martin's channel and others.  We want to bring you into the story with us.\nJoin the family. It's all or nothing -- we have to raise the ENTIRE budget or we won't receive any of it -- so tell your friends!\nWe screened the short film in over 150 film festivals and sold in the US, UK and France and won awards and accolades -- everyone asks us -- when are you going to make the feature? I want to see more of these characters! And so do we!\nALL CONTRIBUTIONS will go directly toward the production and post-productions costs \u2013 including costumes, location rentals, fish, disco balls, fight and dance choreography, travel and housing to Alaska during the Northern Lights and most important feeding and taking care of our stars and crew. No donation is too small. We have raised about 1/3 of the budget through Grants, Awards, and private investors but we need YOU!!\nAgain, If all of our fans and followers just donated $20, we would be well on our way to making the most GLAMTASTIC FILM EVER -- this is a drag story don\u2019t forget so that\u2019s a lot of hair and make-up.\nWe are reaching out to you \u2013 yes YOU specifically - for help!\nEveryone of YOU that comments and tweets at us -- asking when are you going to make the feature version -- the power really is in your hands, and you can make a huge difference in the life and success of this film no matter what your contribution level. Your voice counts and your support of this film matters.\nThank you for supporting all of us fighting for ALASKA IS A DRAG and thank you for being a part of bringing this story to the big screen.\nThank you glamtastics, martinis and all of you being shameless.\nWe can't wait to start shooting and share this movie with y'all!\nxoxoox\nShaz & the Washington Twins\nEXECUTIVE LEVEL\nIf you're interested in making a contribution of up to $10,000 or more and becoming an Executive Producer, please contact us personally at alaskaisadrag@gmail.com, using \"executive\" in the subject line.\nAs an Executive Producer on ALASKA IS A DRAG you'll have the rare opportunity to witness first-hand the making of an independent feature film from start to finish.

The novel premise and incendiary screen chemistry between Martin L. Washington Jr. and \u2026 Spencer Broschard suggest a feature in embryo.\n--David Lamble, Bay Area Reporter\nAlaska is a Drag which features Leo (Martin L. Washington, Jr.), a tough but flamboyant gay African-American man, making an unexpected new friend in Declan (Spencer Broschard) at the cannery where he works. The tone oscillates between hard-edged realism and dreamlike flights of fancy, \u2026this winning short gets deep into the characters, thanks to Washington\u2019s fantastic turn. \u201cAlaska is a Drag\u201d begs for feature treatment.\n -- Philadelphia Gay News\nAlaska is a Drag\nThe irresistible Martin L Washington Jr is a plucky heroine whose fantasies tend to come to life on, and off, the floor of an Alaskan fish factory\u2026. Alaska is a Drag \u2026 gives an energetic and optimistic twist to the usual tragic gay bullying/homophobic tales without getting saccharine or losing any realism.\n--Drew Rowsome, Pop Culture Critic\nAlaska is a Drag, a Tale of Flash and glitz and guts. Loved it!\n -- OutViewOnline\nAlaska Is A Drag is one of the short standouts and Shaz Bennett is a director to watch.\n-- Entertainment Focus\nWith a classic twist on an underrepresented type of friendship, Alaska is a Drag eloquently ties race and gender expression into a heartfelt story that celebrates the importance of friendship without emphasizing romantic relations.\n -- Gender Studies 125", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOf course with any filmmaking project comes risks and challenges. And then add to that finding a Cannery in Alaska that wants to be a DISCO FANTASY for an aspiring Drag Queen but that's what's so inspiring!

Our film is being made by a First time Writer/Director and stars YouTube darlings but not necessarily famous in the traditional film.\n\nTHE PRODUCTION\n\nMaking a first feature -- it's a massive challenge! Shooting ALASKA IS A DRAG in the ultra-low budget range, it gives us a lot of freedom creatively.\n\nHOW WILL WE USE THESE FUNDS?\n\nEvery dollar we raise in this campaign will go DIRECTLY into making ALASKA IS A DRAG. With the funds we're already raised, it means that:\n\nIF WE REACH OUR GOAL OF $50,000, WE CAN GO INTO PRODUCTION!\n\nWhile we are making every effort to keep costs as low as possible, we will still have some expenses in order to make the best film.The money you contribute will go towards: casting expenses, securing the best locations -- this is a big part of what you'll see on the screen! Transportation costs feeding our hardworking cast & crew ... and the MANY other expenses so that everyone can do their job! The list is (seemingly) endless!\n\nBecause our overall production budget is very small and we're determined to make ALASKA IS A DRAG for the least amount possible, please know: EVERY DOLLAR COUNTS.\n\nAs we're moving forward, we'll share regular updates with you.

After years of paying dues and working on other people\u2019s projects, we wondered what would happen if we took matters into our own hands. So we did! We looked around for inspiration, saw an America in recovery and connected with all those folks who weren\u2019t winning\u2014and weren\u2019t losing either\u2014but were instead putting up a fight and merely trying to keep their heads above water. A couple underwater on their home and trapped in a fading marriage seemed like a great (and hilarious!) place to start\u2014and the theme of \u201ctrying\u201d became our meme.\nWhen the script was done, we were determined to make this baby happen\u2014and started by calling everyone we knew to see if anyone could help pass the script on to a few excellent TV stars. Incredibly, the script resonated with folks and we were able to attach our dream cast, including Rachel Nichols (Criminal Minds, GI Joe), Brooke Nevin (Breakout Kings, The 4400) and Barry Bostwick (Spin City, Cougartown). Our other excellent cast members included Jude Angelini, Jacory Gums, Maura Murphy and Chris Wylde.\nPawning vital organs (including some of our own) to cobble together production funding, we finally shot the show over seven whirlwind days with an awesome crew filled to the brim with passion, skill and energy drinks. Then\u2014over the last three months, we\u2019ve whittled the footage down into a tight, fast-moving, super-funny pilot that we can\u2019t wait to start showing people\u2026\nAnd that\u2019s where you come in!\nWe shot Underwater for next to nothing with every dollar spent wisely. But we still have a few critical steps to complete the editing process. By sheer magic our show looks like a big-dollar production\u2014but to give it the best chance to get seen, compete with the big dogs and hopefully start airing(!), we need to clean up the sound, fix the color, and produce a stack of DVDs and promotional materials.\nWe\u2019ll post updates over the course of our Kickstarter run and will check in daily to answer any questions you might have about the show... We could keep typing here, but really all we need to say is THANK YOU.

We will also feature handpicked used film, philosophy, graphic literature, sci-fi, cookbooks, new art and design magazines, and publications by small local presses, as well as select design objects, paper products, vintage housewares, collectables and other curios that we find in our continual search for distinctive used books. \nAs a print studio, we will give members of the community the opportunity to take things a step further by offering workshops such as screen printing and book binding. The multipurpose design of the space will open up to serve as a forum for talks, readings, screenings, exhibitions and other creative programs and performances. \nWe hope to create an environment that is inviting and approachable, dynamic and stimulating, a place you want to stop by every day whether for a social gathering or to inhabit a quiet corner with a stack of our books.\nWhy?\nHighland Park is home to a vibrant artistic community in Northeast Los Angeles that is at a critical stage in its resurgence. The corner of York and Avenue 50 is an epicenter of life in the neighborhood with a handful of new restaurants, bars, shops and galleries in the area, but as we hear from people in the community, there is very little in the way of interactive content. \nBookstores are one of the few retail environments, other than bars and cafes, where people really hang out. They provide a place where people can relax and find inspiration in books. Pop-Hop Books & Curio will be a catalyst, allowing people to turn that inspiration into a physical form. It will offer a place that fosters inspiration and action in equal measure.\nWho?\nThe partners behind Pop-Hop are writer Sarah Balcomb and designer Robey Clark. \nSarah Balcomb was born in New York, grew up elsewhere, and received her MFA in Creative Writing from Columbia University. Her short fiction has appeared in dozens of literary magazines, she has worked at major art museums and small literary nonprofits, and has taught creative writing in public high schools and at the university level. Her first job, at the age of 15, was at an independent bookstore. She is excited to further develop her love of the printed word within her community of Highland Park.\n\nRobey Clark grew up in Richmond, VA, and studied graphic design at RISD. He has been publishing music and printed matter under the moniker Pop-Hop since 2007. He managed the design lab at the Bronx Museum of Art and has taught screen printing at art institutions on both coasts. He likes reading books almost as much as he likes making them.\nHow?\nAll of the design and construction for Pop-Hop\u2019s physical space will be performed by local artists, other friends and ourselves, yet there will still be significant costs for materials, labor and tools. \nOnce we\u2019re up and running, the retail portion of Pop-Hop will help fund our programming, but without assistance from outside donors and through organizations like Kickstarter, we won\u2019t be able to get it started right. \nDonate to Pop-Hop\u2019s start-up fund and help establish a new community-oriented artistic venue in Northeast Los Angeles. We don\u2019t think the printed word is at risk of dying; we just want to shine it up a bit.\nPlease check out the full list of our benefits to the right and images of some of our printed goods below.

We would guess this thing has seen about as much playtime as any toy could offer, and it's time we put her out to pasture, i.e. on a highly visible shelf where your kids can't touch it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is the original mass-produced skateboard. The decal is missing and there's a couple of holes where someone might have tried to put on a different back truck(?), but otherwise it's solid and beautiful. The wheels are red clay and very lightly worn. Both the wheels and and trucks are in great shape."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #1", "update_userinfo": "Holiday Open House & Donation Drop-off", "update_content": "Pop-Hop Books & Curio Holiday Open House & Donation Drop-Off\n-"}, {"status": [{"Project funds successfully": "146 backers pledged $10,282"}, {"Project launches": "NOVEMBER 18, 2011"}]}], "comment_no": 14, "projec_url": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/361643327/pop-hop-books-and-curio", "project_name": "Pop-Hop Books & Curio"}}, {"backer": "TBVE Films", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "One of the questions people always ask us is, \u201cWhat\u2019s in the outtakes?\u201d\nSTYLE WARS was originally edited to its 69 minute length from about 30 hours of 16 mm film that we shot in 1981 and 1982. Hours of exciting and wonderful scenes in the extra footage that didn\u2019t make it into the finished film need to be restored. There are many shots of trains and some surprising masterpieces rescued from oblivion.\nLike these outtakes, from the 2-disc DVD set:\nHours of additional amazing footage are in the archives.\nThere are more scenes from the B boy battle at United Skates of America between the Rock Steady Crew and the Dynamic Rockers, and more interviews with Skeme and his mom, Dez, Kase 2, Shy, Seen, Dondi and all the other kings and characters that people have grown to love.\nBut this history is threatened. The original footage is damaged and fading. Fortunately, it will be possible to repair using digital technology. It will cost $28,000 to save and restore the outtakes. Saving the best outtakes is an important component of our overall project to restore the entire negative of the film and make an HD master which will preserve the record of the first painted trains in their original vivid colors.\nDirected by Tony Silver and produced by Tony Silver and Henry Chalfant, STYLE WARS was awarded the Grand Prize for Documentaries at the 1983 Sundance Film Festival. The film is considered the indispensable document of New York Street culture of the early '80s, the record on film of a golden age of youthful creativity that exploded into the world from a city in crisis.\nWe invite you to take part in this historic enterprise.

We were very disappointed to discover that the negative had been damaged in storage and that fixing each damaged frame would cost much more money than we had at the time. However we were determined to be able to fix it some day. I'm very happy to say that we have finally succeeded. I'm only sorry that Tony isn't able to be here to enjoy his dream. We couldn't have done it without you, the fans and enthusiasts of the film, who dug into your pockets to help us fund the project. And we had the very good fortune to meet Chris Woods who was the man who, expertly, and with great sensitivity and patience was able to restore the film digitally, frame by frame. We hope to have a Blu Ray available in time for the thirtieth anniversary of Style Wars' 1984 release, early in 2014. The Blu Ray, in addition to the restored Hi Definition film, will include amazing bonus features; the much anticipated OUTTAKES (thank you, Kickstarter) and never-before-seen footage from the editing room where Style Wars was cut. In this amazing 30-year-old footage you'll seeTony Silver, Victor Kanefsky, Sam Pollard, Burleigh Wartes and myself working, discussing and battling to shape the story that we were ultimately able to tell in the completed film. Thank you for all your support. We are very grateful."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #26", "update_userinfo": "We\u2019d like to give you an update.", "update_content": "To all the generous contributors to last years Style Wars\u2026 the Outtakes Kickstarter project, almost a year has passed and we\u2019d like to give you an update. Last fall, while we were digging through the 16 mm outtakes stored at the Academy Film archive, Chris Woods, at Cinema Pixel, was beginning to repair the HD scans of the damaged A and B rolls. Sometime in the spring of 2012 he finished this monumental task. Chris, who has a background in film, has completed this painstaking work. The restoration turned out beautifully and Chris was careful not to over-do the restoration, to the point of losing the wonderful sensual quality of film. Meanwhile, we have been organizing the reels of outtakes and getting ready to scan this material. With the money raised on Kickstarter, we have been able to transfer everything to High Definition. It remains for me to go through it all and select the best of everything that never made it into the original film. This means that sometime in (hopefully) the first half of 2013, we\u2019ll be able to bring out the High Definition version of Style Wars and complete our promised distribution of awards to our contributors. We\u2019re grateful for your generosity and your great patience and very excited to soon be able to show you the restored Style Wars."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #25", "update_userinfo": "Certificates to all!", "update_content": "The last of the certificates were emailed early last week.
