But a small group of fanatic hologram hackers did believe, and we were able to ship them thousands of our first generation holographic dev kits. To us, holographic displays weren't just a dream from sci-fi movies \u2014 they were something real that we used every day.\nAnd yet, we've always wanted a way for everyone to have their own holographic display. That's why today we're so excited to share something we've been working on in secret for the past 18 months: the Looking Glass Portrait \u2014 your first personal holographic display.\nYou don't need to know how to program to use this holographic display. Looking Glass Portrait is designed for the millions of people that work or play in 3D in any way: Artists, Designers, Developers, Filmmakers, Photographers, and those of you who are just starting to explore three-dimensional capture and creation. Even phones can now capture holograms*.\nSo if your curiosity led to you to this page and you're wondering if you're the type of person that could own their own personal holographic display....the answer is yes. Find out everything you can do with this new magical invention in the scroll below. And welcome to the future!\nMinimum Requirements for Desktop Mode\n HoloPlay Studio works with PC and Mac. \nTo import, edit, process and convert depth photos, videos, and other holographic media, almost all PCs and Macs with HDMI and USB-C will work. Post a question in the Comments section if you have any questions about this. \nTo run and create heavier-duty interactive applications with Unity or Unreal, we recommend a PC with a GTX 1650 or equivalent, CPU with Intel i5 or higher, and at least 8GB of RAM. \nMinimum Requirements for playback in Standalone Mode\nYour imagination (also, USB-C or wall power).\n Phones can now capture holograms*.\nThe easiest way to make a hologram is to take a Portrait mode photo with your phone.\nBelieve it or not, those Portrait mode photos you've been taking have depth information hidden behind them. This is normally used to generate bokeh effect, and now the software that comes with every Looking Glass Portrait can use that same depth info to generate a three-dimensional hologram with a single click.\nThe new iPhone 12 Pro using a combination of advanced machine learning techniques and LiDAR capabilities can capture the best depth photos yet with a single shot.\n* These iPhone models support Portrait mode: iPhone 12, iPhone 12 mini, iPhone 12 Pro, iPhone 12 Pro Max, iPhone SE (2nd generation), iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro, iPhone 11 Pro Max, iPhone XR, iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max, iPhone X, iPhone 8 Plus, and iPhone 7 Plus. Some brand-name Android phones also support depth capture with portrait mode photos. The newer the phone, generally, the better the depth map.  \n\nOn January 6, 2021, we announced support for a number of flagship Android phones as well as a new conversion service that can take any 2D image and convert than into a 3D hologram for Looking Glass Portrait. Read this update.\n\nHere's a running list of all the compatible Android phones that will work directly with HoloPlay Studio: \nMost of the newer flagship Samsung phones, including A7, A9, S10, S10e, S9+, S20, S20+, S20 Ultra.\nSome of the Huawei phones with \"Aperture\" mode, including Mate 20, Mate 20 Lite, Mate 20 Pro, P20 Pro, P30 Pro.\nNewer Pixel phones, including the Pixel 3, 4, and 5 models.\nFor a more updated list, head on over here. \nUse any camera to capture super-realistic holograms.\nIf you're looking to push the limits of holographic capture even further, Looking Glass Portrait can also display light field photos. This is a fancy term for a series of images taken from different perspectives. You can now capture these advanced three-dimensional photographs with conventional panning shot techniques using the camera you already own and display them in Looking Glass Portrait. \nThis is a simple 4K panning video. It has everything needed for a super-realistic holographic \"light field\" photograph.\nBecause this method captures and displays not only depth but also the directionality of millions of rays of light. even objects like a magnifying lens work in the resulting hologram like a real magnifying lens would.\n*Compatibility: Works with any camera (including phones), that can record 4K video.\nFor this advanced capture technique, you can use your own rail, stabilized camera, or use the rail included in the Holographic Capture Bundle.\nSequence by Giovanni Remigi, a 3D artist and the developer of Lentigram, an interlacing software package for the production of high quality three-dimensional photographs.\nSalmon Tartine by Alban (Sketchfab)\nFlower Point Cloud Photogrammetry by Moshe Caine (Sketchfab)\nTransform photogrammetry and LiDAR scans into holograms.\nPhotogrammetry-based 3D scans and the newest LiDAR scanning with the iPhone 12 Pro and iPad Pro can be played back in the Looking Glass Portrait with ease. The advantage of these techniques is both aesthetic and practical \u2014 this is the easiest way to take and display 360\u00b0 captures of people, places, and objects.\n\n*Compatibility: Works with point cloud and mesh-based 3D output from most known photogrammetry software packages including Metashape, Zephyr, itSeez3D, and Reality Capture. Also compatible with the exports from LiDAR scanning packages Canvas by Occipital, SiteScape, Polycam, and 3D Scanner App. \nWe're planning on adding support for a growing number of real-world 3D capture formats, including direct conversion of stereo photos taken with cameras like the classic Fujifilm FinePix and conversion of turntable captures into holograms. \nIt is confirmed that HoloPlay Studio will support direct SBS format import in Q3 of 2021. \nMake holographic video recordings with a single click.\nFor most of us that have long dreamed of a holographic future, the ultimate goal has been to be able to record a holographic message and send that to someone across the world (or in a galaxy far, far away). Imagine sending a holographic birthday message, or saying hello as a hologram to your great-great-great granddaughter. Now you can!\nPrototype system in July 2020 showing a test video stream of an Azure Kinect depth video played back in the Looking Glass Portrait.\nThe Looking Glass Portrait comes with access to Depth Recorder, a PC and Mac compatible app that lets anyone with a Microsoft Azure Kinect, Intel RealSense depth camera, or iPhone X/11/12 record, send and play back 10-second holographic messages in their Looking Glass Portrait.\nIf you don't have a depth camera already and you're interested in recording holographic messages, the Holographic Capture Bundle comes with an Azure Kinect depth camera and custom Looking Glass Azure Kinect Stand. \nDepth Recorder also comes with a range of effects to overlay your holographic recordings. Recording above made with the Microsoft Azure Kinect\nRecorded using the Intel RealSense D435\nThe newest iPhones (X, 11, 12, 12 Pro, 12 Pro Max) have the ability to record depth videos with their front facing TrueDepth camera, and in the case of the iPhone 12 Pro and 12 Pro Max, also with their back-facing LiDAR enhanced cameras.\nRecord holographic videos for playback with apps like Record3D and import them easily into the Looking Glass software ecosystem for rapid conversion into holographic videos suitable for playback in the Looking Glass Portrait. \nCompatibility: the Depth Recorder app works with the Microsoft Azure Kinect and Intel RealSense D415 & D435. You can also playback Record3D recordings made with the newest iPhones (X, 11, 12, 12 Pro, 12 Pro Max) and even platforms like the OAK-D by OpenCV AI Kit.  \nFor professionals working with volumetric video production tools like Depthkit and Depthkit Cinema, you can now easily import your work into the Looking Glass Portrait. This media can be played back in Desktop mode or in Standalone mode. This means you can now send someone a holographic display preloaded with your volumetric video content that will run right on power-up.  \nFootage captured with Depthkit Cinema\nFor high quality volumetric video content, look no further than the few dozen volumetric capture studios operating around the world that work by pointing dozens to hundreds of cameras at a group of people on vast stages. \nLooking Glass Portrait can take in volumetric content captured in studios like 4DViews, Microsoft Reality Capture, Mantis Vision and Metastage, displaying these as three-dimensional moving images - setting the \"stage\" for the next phase of the moving image. \nFootage from volumetric capture company 4DViews\nFootage taken by Microsoft Mixed Reality Capture Studios\nCIBER GEISHA by Oscar Creativo (via Sketchfab)\nWhether you're a 3D designer, just starting to learn 3D modeling or someone who is exploring the world of 3D creations on platforms like Sketchfab, you can easily bring people, both real and imagined, into your Looking Glass Portrait.\nGLOW by XenSwapper (via Sketchfab)\nCIBER WOLF by Oscar Creativo (via Sketchfab)\nUse Looking Glass plugins for Maya and Blender for both live and rendered out scenes or import animated models with the 3D Model Importer.\nOver the past few years we've developed and refined powerful Unity and Unreal plugins for the Looking Glass lineup. Now these plugins can be used with the Looking Glass Portrait to create holographic apps of your own. \nExperimental iPhone face tracking Animoji app built in Unity\nGo to our docs page here to read more about our Unity and Unreal plugins, with more details on what's to come in the Roadmap below.\n\nNote: for developers building in DirectX, OpenGL, or Metal that want deeper levels of access and more control over how they integrate with the Looking Glass Portrait, we've developed a powerful cross-platform SDK called HoloPlay Core. More details here. \nLooking Glass Portrait works with a wide variety of peripherals in Desktop mode, allowing for advanced interaction with holograms. This includes VR controllers, various sensors for environmental inputs, tactile feedback systems, as well as hand-sensing devices like the Leap Motion Controller (part of the Holographic Capture Bundle). \nInteractive \"Blobs\" with the Leap Motion Controller. Inspired by the work of Eliza (https://www.elizasj.com/) @iamelizasj (on Twitter & IG).\n Looking Glass Documentation (Looking Glass Portrait documentation coming soon) \n Looking Glass Discord (if you have a quick question you want answered, either post in comments above or join our Discord)\n Looking Glass Blog \nThe Looking Glass Portrait is powered by the next generation of light field technology. The display works by generating between 45 to 100 views of a three-dimensional scene and projecting those perspectives simultaneously. Unlike any display that has come before it or in the market today, multiple users can gather around a Looking Glass Portrait to see different superstereoscopic perspectives without glasses or a headset.\n\nAnother way to think of this is, holograms are kind of like videos played back in space instead of time.\nAs you move around the Looking Glass, your eyes are exposed to millions of rays of light that are reproducing captured content from the real world or playing back 3D synthetic content in the most realistic way ever developed. Because of this approach, unlike other AR/VR or 3D monitor technologies which can sometimes cause nausea and discomfort, the Looking Glass Portrait produces a viewing experience that is as comfortable as you'd experience looking at the real world.\n58\u00ba view cone that hides all errant views and only shows content within the \"Hologram Zone\"\nUnlike the first generation of Looking Glass launched back in 2018, this next generation system has reworked the optical system so that the holograms are no longer \"contained\" in a volume. They can project in front of and behind the physical display, meaning you can literally touch these holograms.\nUntil now, holographic displays needed powerful gaming laptops to run even the simplest holographic media. Looking Glass Portrait can still work in that tethered mode with PCs and Macs -- but it is the first system with an additional Standalone Mode, thanks to a built-in computer (Raspberry Pi 4) and a proprietary holographic software stack that can run high-fidelity recorded holographic media at 60fps. Just plug in the Looking Glass Portrait into power via the included USB-C cable.\nAll Looking Glass Portrait units will come with an internal integrated Wi-Fi module at no additional charge. Potential Wi-Fi enabled features, such as loading and sharing of holographic media with a mobile device, are planned for release via free software update after initial shipments go out. See Roadmap below for more details.\nQuestions about how the Looking Glass Portrait works and how they compare to other displays? Ask us on Discord!\nMicro light field of a wasp sequence by Giovanni Remigi, a 3D artist and the developer of Lentigram, an interlacing software package for the production of high quality three-dimensional photographs.\nOver the years, we've built a steady, strong and vibrant 3D community around holographic displays and creation. Since we founded the company in 2014, we've witnessed creators from all over the world connect and share their work via the third dimension. We welcome all to join our community with open three-dimensional arms. \nIn the past few weeks, as we've been quietly sharing the Looking Glass Portrait with some artists in the community, we've been fortunate enough that some of them have agreed to let us share some of their work in the Looking Glass Portrait. \nTrain Station Scene by Dedouze.

Since launching the first Looking Glass in 2018, the Looking Glass Club has grown significantly and often tweets under the hashtag #\u30eb\u30ad\u30b0\u30e9\u30b9. \nWant to help us spread the word? Click this link to easily share this project on Twitter. \nThe Looking Glass Factory team is made up of dozens of Artists, Engineers and Inventors based (now, mostly remotely) out of Hong Kong & Greenpoint, Brooklyn. \nFolks from our US team\nFolks from our HK team\nThey say distance makes the heart grow fonder and while we couldn't agree more, we've had the benefit of being able to see each other as three-dimensional beings as demonstrated here with the Looking Glass Portrait.\nOne of the very first Looking Glass Portrait Prototypes\nSome additional behind-the-scenes prototype clips here. \nWe are attempting to make the Looking Glass Portrait carbon negative.\nWhile it's difficult to calculate precise environmental impact and to offset that impact for a new type of technology being made for the first time, we've calculated the embodied energy of each component in the Looking Glass Portrait as well as the average operating energy over its lifetime to the best of our knowledge. This is around 510MJ running on Standalone or 332MJ running on a PC/Mac of total energy.\nWe pay for carbon offsets from Native Energy for 2x this amount of total energy, so that each Looking Glass Portrait sold in theory will not only be carbon neutral over its lifetime, but it also should pull out its carbon-weight from the atmosphere.\nBecause this carbon offset payment comes straight from our profits \u2014 you won't be charged extra for this \u2014 we believe this will create a forcing function for our organization over time to reduce the carbon footprint of our products.\nWe surely aren't going to get this right on the first go, and we would love to hear from folks on their ideas for further improvements along the way.\nWhen we invented the first holographic light field display dev kits back in 2018, we estimated that within ten years over ten million people would have one, if they only understood its benefits.\nIllustration from 2018 when we are first starting to see the future to come.\nThe interfaces of the future wouldn't be worn on your head 16 hours a day, but they would be more like campfires glowing with three-dimensional fields of light that you could gather around with others. Sometimes in the same room, other times a world apart.\nIllustration by Jether Amar\n [Tested] Hands on Holographic Display Prototype Hands-On: Looking Glass Portrait (Jan 4, 2021) \nThis project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 1,100+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $460M raised between them.\nIn our Press Kit you'll find GIFs, images, spec sheets, and more.

We shipped thousands of those systems on-time and at a high level of quality, kicking off the first wave of holographic creation around the world.\n\nOur 35-person team operates between offices in Brooklyn, NY and in Hong Kong and this affords us advantages that other groups may not have. This includes the benefit of an unusually cross-disciplinary team with deep shared knowledge of both hardware, software, and supply chain. This has made us the only group in the world that has successfully shipped multiviewer holographic light field displays and we will bring that experience to this project.\n\nOf course this is a particularly challenging time, so we've taken some additional measures in advance. This includes setting up a short-run production facility adjacent to our Hong Kong laboratory for tighter control over the initial production runs, running FCC pre-checks at the prototype stage to avoid surprises during the production phase, and securing capital for inventory so that critical parts with long lead times could be ordered before the Kickstarter campaign even started.\n\nWe would only delay shipments in a few exceptional cases. If we found the production units did not meet our high standards, for instance, we would delay shipment until we could meet or exceed our quality standards. And there's always a small chance of delays in the event of a complete global shutdown of supply chain due to the pandemic. We don't expect either of these things to happen, but if they do we will be fully transparent with you along the way.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 45 or more", "title": "Hologram Club Sweatshirt", "descp": "Be a part of our community and receive a limited-edition launch special \"Hologram Club\" sweatshirt.

Suddenly chasms seem to drop infinitely into your table, and game characters and monsters spring up from the game board.  This is gaming unlike anything you've experienced before. \nOut of the box you'll have access to free games as well as thousands of officially licensed RPG adventures, and a multitude of classic tabletop, action video, puzzle, and party games. \n\"When we started designing the Tilt Five system our focus wasn't on the technology for technology's sake.  We wanted to provide an amazing gaming experience that blends the things you love about video games and board games. And we wanted it to be just as fun when playing solo, together with your friends, or even when you're apart.\"  Jeri Ellsworth, Co-Founder & CEO\nSo some of you are saying \"but you showed composited shots in your video.\"  Yeah, we knew you'd say this.  In order to show the group experience of playing games around the table together, we had to make a creative choice.  Shooting through-the-lens footage is difficult, and when you add in actors and scenery it's next to impossible. Here are many of the same shots as you would see them through the lens of the glasses, minus the actors and scenery of course. \nWe decided to take a different approach at Tilt Five.  We focused on building an AR system that creates amazing tabletop gaming experiences, with glasses so lightweight and comfortable you can play all day.  Our lenses are large and wide open, so the glasses don't block your vision. You can see your friends, pizza, and drinks, while you play true head to head games around the table. The patented 110\u00b0 field of view optical system fills the entire game board, and everything is in focus whether you're leaning back in your chair or pressing your chin to the board to get a better look at the details on that dragon. To top it all off, the system had to be affordable. \nWe've been out and about showing the Tilt Five pre-production system to thousands of people.  The responses have been overwhelmingly positive, and they're a sure sign that we're onto something special here.  \nCheck out what people at PAX West had to say: \nOther professionals in the gaming and technology industries are loving it too:\n\u201cThis strategy and technology is the correct path forward for the future of AR. The Tilt Five approach to 3D augmented reality ensures that I can experience a simulated reality *and* the real world at the same time. I am excited as a technophile and, more importantly, as a gamer excited to share augmented reality experiences with my friends and family.\u201d Randy Pitchford, Gearbox Software\n\u201cFantasy Grounds constantly strives to reproduce the experience of playing Dungeons & Dragons around a tabletop. Tilt Five's amazing Augmented Reality interface opens the door to a whole new level of experience and we are super excited to be working with them on the platform of the future.\u201d Doug Davison, SmiteWorks, Fantasy Grounds\n\u201cVery excited, the first affordable social AR, Tilt Five is delivering on that long awaited promise of playing augmented reality games with your friends, either face to face or remote.\u201d Ken Birdwell, formerly Valve Software\n\u201cTilt Five is exactly the AR product that I could see myself using regularly.\u201d Norman Chan, Tested\nFor media inquiries:  press@tiltfive.com\nWith the Tilt Five LE or XE System, you get everything you need to start playing amazing games, and set-up is a breeze.  The system comes with the glasses, a wand controller, the game board, USB cable, a variety pack of nose pieces, and introductory games.  If you wear prescription glasses, no problem, the Tilt Five glasses will work over most prescription glasses.  Just pick the nose piece that works the best.\nFlip open the board, plug into a phone, tablet, or PC, your choice, slip on the glasses, and start playing.  It's really that easy.  \nWith the XE Game Board you get even more space to play as well as multiple configurations.  Prop one end up with the kickstand and you suddenly get infinite depth and additional height.  Configure it as a square board, or add the additional section and convert it into a 42 inch long board, perfect for spreading out your campaign maps for those epic game nights.  It will also come with a water and fingerprint resistant coating, so clean-up is a breeze.  \nWe've designed the Tilt Five System to be equally fun whether you're playing solo or with all of your friends.  We've also designed the system to be cross-play friendly, so if your friends don't have Tilt Five yet, they can play along with their phone, tablet, or PC. \nSolo play.  Sometimes you just feel like unwinding and immersing yourself in a fun single player game.  Tilt Five is great for solo play, whether you're determined to clear a dungeon or you want to practice that last hairpin turn before you race against your friends.     \nPerfect for multiplayer games.  Tilt Five shines when it comes to social game play.  You can sit around the game board with all of your friends and enjoy the togetherness of traditional tabletop gaming, with the added dimension of playing games in this new holographic game space. \nLink your boards over the internet and play even when you're apart.  You can share the same virtual space with your friends, no matter where they are in the world.  It will feel like you're in the same room playing together.  You'll never have to miss a game night again.\nTilt Five was designed from the ground up to be equally fun for video games, board games, and everything in between.  You get all the advantages of video games- saving your games when your quests run too long, digital training and rules assistance to help you learn games faster, network play, and the ability to stream your game to your adoring fans on Twitch, Mixer, and Youtube.  You also get completely new capabilities- your own private perspective to plan your next move in secret, dynamic story telling tools to impress your adventurers in your next RPG campaign, and the melding of physical and virtual game objects.  \nYou get your own private perspective.  Now you no longer have to find creative ways to hide your strategies or next move from your friends.  Everyone has their own private view into the holographic game space.  As a DM this feature gives you an amazing tool to map out your campaign and heighten your story telling.   \nBring your miniatures to life and enjoy new playing card interactions. Your miniature\u2019s actions are no longer trapped in your mind, now they come to life with vivid special effects, sounds, and interactions. And you can use enhanced playing cards to cast spells, activate special abilities, and send your creatures into battle.\nUse the wand to interact with the holographic game space.  With the wand you can poke, shove, shoot, burn, drag, slide, twirl, and crush.\nTilt Five ships with a set of free introductory single and multiplayer games that you can start playing right away.  The games include a variety of interactions that will make familiarizing yourself with the system super easy and fun. All of the included games will work on Windows and Android devices.  \nAny piece of gaming hardware is worthless without content, so we've designed the software interfaces to be easy to use and have been securing content partners across video games, board games, and RPG's, as well as non-gaming applications.\nWe've designed the Pledge Levels to be as straight forward and simple as possible. With the LE Kit you get everything you need to start playing holographic games, with one pair of glasses, a wand, and the basic square game board.  At the XE level, you get a larger, more configurable game board, a deluxe box with carrying handle, and access to all the stretch goals.  With the Beta / XE level you get all the perks of the XE level, plus you get to be one of the first to get glasses in your hands.  You'll get a Beta version of the glasses and wand, and you get to be part of a limited group with access to the Beta Tester Forum.  You'll help us squash bugs and ensure that the consumer versions of the LE and XE kits will be the absolute best that they can be.  The final level is for our backers that really want to have everything, including many of the early glasses that are a part of our history.  You get everything in the Beta / XE level and a whole lot more.  \n How to add on additional sets to your pledge. If you want to add on an additional set to your pledge this is actually quite easy.  Just add the amount for the additional kit that you want to your existing pledge level.\nFor example:  If you already pledged at the XE Kit level, and you want another set of glasses, just add the additional amount for another XE Kit to your current pledge.  $359 XE Kit + $359 XE Kit = $718.  When surveys are sent out by BackerKit at the end of the campaign, you'll be able to specify what you pledged for, 2 XE Kits.\nIf you want to add additional game boards you will be able to do this as an add-on when you receive the BackerKit survey at the end of the campaign.  Details on prices will be announced soon.\nBy reaching these goals it helps us hit higher production volumes, and we'll be able to add more features and customization to your kits.  Help spread the word, so we can unlock as many stretch goals as possible for you. \nHelp us out and share Tilt Five with your friends!\nDo you have friends, family, frenemies, fellow adventurers, and fabulous game developers that would enjoy playing games in augmented reality?  Let them know about Tilt Five by sharing our campaign with them.\n With your help we'll have a wildly successful campaign, and then we'll all get to play games together with Tilt Five.\nWe've spent years designing and perfecting the Tilt Five glasses, with the primary goal of creating an incredibly fun and affordable augmented reality system that you'll love playing games with.  For us, it's always been about sharing the joy of playing games in this whole new way.  We've always believed that the technology behind Tilt Five should accentuate the gaming experience, and we've designed it to do just that.\nThe glasses are the heart of the Tilt Five system.  They have everything you need for an amazing gaming experience.  Two HD micro projectors, stereo speakers, microphone, tracking cameras, and a high speed, high accuracy Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) on board.  And at a weight of 85 grams, you'll be able to wear them for even the longest of game nights. \nComputer Vision Camera.  To have a truly mixed reality experience, you need the ability to track hands, playing cards, tokens, miniatures, and other objects.  The Tilt Five glasses have a high resolution computer vision camera with infrared illumination on board.  This allows the camera to work in any lighting condition.  If you're a developer, we give you access to this camera, along with some of our own examples, so you can do whatever you want with it.  Do you want to get in there and use your own tracking algorithms, be our guest! \nHere's a hand tracking example using the computer vision camera.  All the footage was shot through the lens of the glasses.\nThe wand is the most direct way to interact with your games.  With our 6 degrees of freedom tracking on the wand, utilizing both optical and high speed IMUs, you'll never miss that target or be late casting those game changing spells. All the buttons you need are on board and include analog joystick with button press, analog trigger, and seven additional buttons.  And if traditional game pads are more your style, no worries, Tilt Five plays great with traditional game pads, joysticks, keyboards, mice, or your other favorite gaming peripherals.  \nPrototyping\nIt's not easy to make a comfortable, and lightweight pair of augmented reality glasses.  It took us multiple iterations and a lot of prototyping to get to a final form factor that we're happy with and that you'll enjoy wearing during all those long RPG campaigns and epic game nights.  \nManufacturing\nNot only did we do extensive prototyping, we also did multiple pilot runs to test various aspects of the evolving design, as well as reliability testing and pre-certification.  Some of these early production run glasses are currently being used by developers who are working on content for the system. \n Specifications\nDual 720p HD projectors, polarized for stereo display\n110\u00b0 diagonal field of view\n180 Hz color field sequential image projection engine\nOptimized for viewing distances from 10 cm (4 in.) to 2 m (6.5 ft.)\nDedicated hardware image stabilization operating per-color-field at 180 Hz\nDedicated 8MP application-accessible computer vision camera\nUSB 3.1 gen 2 connectivity (USB 3.0 required on the host system)\nSupports applications running up to 60 fps\nStereo speakers\nMicrophone\n85 grams total weight of glasses\nBluetooth Low Energy for low latency connectivity\n  Timeline\nIt all started with an idea: bring people together and have fun playing tabletop games in augmented reality.\nWith Tilt Five every kit is also a developer kit.  Our SDK is readily-available for anyone who wants to create tabletop mixed reality applications, and it's designed for eased adoption and to have a minimal footprint. We support integrations on host platforms through native APIs and we provide ready-made plugins for Unity 5.5+ and Unreal Engine 4.\nHead to our website to learn more about developing for Tilt Five. \nWe wouldn't be where we are today without the hard work of all the engineers and developers we've had the pleasure to call colleagues and friends.  To all the crew that worked late nights with us, we can't thank you enough.  You know who you are. \nWe'd also like to thank all of our mentors and advisers who spent countless hours helping us to navigate the roller-coaster ride that is being in a start-up.  \nAnd a final thanks to our videographer, and the amazing team he assembled:\nIn Partnership with\nThis project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 800+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $350MM raised between them. \nShipping\nShipping will be charged after the Kickstarter finishes based on actual costs incurred to ship and is collected via our pledge manager BackerKit. This allows us to charge fairly for all backers and avoid a 'one size fits all' mentality to shipping. \nWe will be shipping your rewards at our cost to one of our fulfillment company\u2019s international hubs. We'll cover the costs of custom duties to get the rewards into those countries.  You'll still be responsible for local taxes or value added taxes that may apply. \nDepending on where you are in the world, we will either ship to you from the fulfillment company\u2019s hub in the EU, China, Canada, Australia (Australia and New Zealand backers) or the US (several hubs). Our manufacturing partner in Japan will handle shipments to our backers in Japan and Korea.\nFollowing is a list of very rough estimates for shipping a standard LE or XE Kit (~ 5lbs estimated weight, or 2.27kg). Keep in mind these are just estimates, and the cost may increase depending on how many kits you pledge for, and any add-ons that you select during the pledge manager. Costs may also decrease depending on deals that our fulfillment house is able to work out with carriers. Once we have all of the pledges and number of units going to each region, we'll work with our shipping fulfillment partner to get you the best possible price on shipping. \nPackages will also be fully insured and will have tracking.\nUSA: $25-$35 to most states.\nCANADA: $35-$45 to most cities.\nLATIN AMERICA: $50-$65 to most countries.\nASIA: $15 to China and Hong Kong. $35 to most other countries.\nJAPAN and KOREA: $25-$30 to most cities.\nOCEANIA: $30-$45 to Australia. $45 to New Zealand.\nAFRICA: $65 to most countries.\nEUROPE: $30-$45 to most countries.\nNorway, Finland, Estonia, and Latvia: $35-$45.\nBosnia/Herzegowina, Croatia, and Iceland:  $45.\nIsrael, Liechtenstein, and Serbia: $50-$60.\nWe are unable to ship to PO Boxes domestically or internationally.

More than anything, we want you, our backers, to be happy and proud to support our company.\n\nSupply Chain Risk: Manufacturing can be unpredictable. Parts may be delayed, factories may receive incorrect components (our CEO has first-hand experience dealing with this), new Tariffs may be implemented without warning, and factory equipment can break slowing down the manufacturing line. All of these things have the potential to delay the manufacturing process. Luckily we have trusted manufacturing and project management partners already in place, and we can address these issues quickly should they arise. \n\nShipping Risk: The logistics involved with global shipping and warehousing are incredibly complicated, that\u2019s why we intend to outsource this to experts. Even then, delays can happen due to uncontrollable factors, such as weather and port congestion.

It was inspired by games like Castlevania, the Wizardry series, and Clock Tower. You can explore the inside and outside of the castle using adventure game mechanics and battle demons with strategic mouse clicks.\nExplore the world of Zelle as the protagonist, Emerada, a boy who\u2019s been confined to his room in an old castle by a Reaper. He makes a daring escape attempt to return home to his nearby village, but the castle is deep within a forest that\u2019s haunted by demons. The Goddess grants him the power to repel the demons, but he must face many trials before winning his freedom. A Reaper wearing a strange mask, a moon-faced man, a little boy who loves to dance... The truth gradually comes to light as his lost memories return. \nThis is but one night in the story of a little boy\u2019s life.\nFeatures\nSolve intuitive puzzles to progress in this adventure game\nShifts between a first-person perspective and a JRPG-like top-down view\nMeet and part with mysterious and comical characters\nUncover gratifyingly grotesque scenes throughout the game\nBuckle up for an emotional rollercoaster that\u2019ll have you laughing, crying, and screaming in fear\nBattle\nYou can drive back demons with the protagonist\u2019s Rosary. All you need to do is click the same color Rosary as your opponent\u2019s eye color. But it\u2019s game over if you click the wrong one or run out of time! Get ready for some tense battles.\nPLAY\n\nMap\nIn first-person perspective, you can explore the 3D map and collect items to proceed. Try to find all the castle\u2019s charming residents. But watch out! Demons are hiding in every nook and cranny.\n In the top-down view, you can move the protagonist with your keyboard\u2019s arrow keys. You can examine objects and talk with people using the confirm button, just like in a regular JRPG!\nThe protagonist walking along a beach.\nMost of Zelle\u2019s graphics were created using the collage technique. Each map page is a single cohesive picture, which helps make every image pop. I hope these ominous, fantastical graphics leave a deep impression on you. Feel free to take as much time as you need to soak in the stunning view of the Goddess statue on top of the toilet.\nAnd don\u2019t forget to pay attention to the bewitching graphics and animations of all the demons too.\nZelle has a variety of original background music which was lovingly composed by Xion.\nThis is the sheet music for Zelle\u2019s main theme. Xion's performance is dazzlingly ephemeral. This main theme will appear in different variations throughout the game.\nClick to Zoom-out\n                                                                                        Zelle is already well on its way to being completed, but some additions and quality improvements could make the game even more fun. Here are some of the stretch goals I have in mind.\nBase Goals\n-----------------------\nUSD 2,250\nZelle will be localized into English. \n\nStretch Goals\n-----------------------\nUSD 2,730 \nI will get a vocalist to sing the song during the game\u2019s ending. \n\nUSD 3,640 \nI will add a new stage called \u201cGrave of the Holy Warriors\u201d. \n\nUSD 7,280\nI will add a secret boss. \n\nUSD 10,900\nI\u2019m not sure it\u2019ll get this far, so this is still to be determined.\n\n  Staff\nFuming is Zelle\u2019s developer. He created all the graphics, the game system, and the story, and is also working to promote and advertise the game.\n\nXion created all the music. He put a lot of time and effort into composing all the haunting, enigmatic soundtrack. He\u2019s also played Zelle even more than I have, so I\u2019m having him help me out a lot with the debugging process. (Hey!)\nElizabeth handled the translation. Zelle is originally written in Japanese, but she\u2019s paid special attention to make sure English-speaking players get the same fun experience.\nIf the goal is surpassed where does the extra money go?\nZelle has already spent about 3 years in production and is almost complete. The project has made it this far using my personal funds, but in order to determine whether the game can be released, I\u2019d like to use all of your support to speed up the final touches, get the game localized into English, and expand on the game\u2019s contents.\nHere\u2019s what needs to be covered yet before the game is released:\nCreating the ending scene\nAdditional animations\nJapanese to English translation fee\nTweaks to improve the graphics, music, and game system\nDebugging the game\nIf the goal is surpassed where does the extra money go?\nInstead of using your money to create merchandise or an artbook, I\u2019d like to add more features to the game. (See the stretch goals for more details!)\nTo everyone reading this\nFirst of all, thank you so much for reading this far! If anyone has even the slightest interest in Zelle, it would make me happier than anything else. With your support, I\u2019d love to make Zelle reach even more people and become an even better game.

As a backer, you will get access to this SDK so that you can create interactive holographic apps of your own.\n\n3D model and animations in OBJ, FBX, STL and gLTF format can be imported into the Looking Glass with a couple clicks using the Model and Animation Importer App.\n\nDozens of holographic apps are available for free download using the App Library, included with every Looking Glass shipment. These include volumetric video clips, holographic film shorts, lightfield and 3D scan viewer apps, new types of holographic games, virtual pets, CT-scan/DICOM importers, a WYSIWYG 3D model previewer for 3D printing, and much more.

Digital fabrication and \u20183D Making\u2019 are quickly making their way into school curriculum as 3D authoring tools like Tinkercad and Sketchup become more accessible. However, 3D printers are often expensive to maintain and operate and it takes a long time produce a full print. The Looking Glass affords students the gratification of viewing their complex 3D models, designs and structures as they are creating and before they commit to a physical 3D print.  \n\n  Help create the future of 3D.

In the early beta release of the application, only gLTF, OBJ and glb file formats are accepted but more are coming soon!  \nThe Model Importer uses a special type of control to allow you to view your model from different perspectives in 3D. You can rotate around your model by left clicking and dragging. You can pan around the scene by right clicking and dragging, and you can zoom in by scrolling. \nIf you're just getting started and want to start exploring a world of 3D content, we highly recommend using Sketchfab as they have one of the biggest repositories of glTF files, so you can have access to a huge library of 3D models as you learn to make your own! \nIf you want to go more in-depth with the Model Importer, we've written a brief Model Importer Getting Started Guide for early beta users of the Looking Glass. \n3 - Holographic App Library\nStarry Night Diorama Tilt Brush by george peaslee via Sketchfab\nThe Looking Glass will launch with a free App Library which will be a Window PC/MAC executable that manages content for your Looking Glass. With the Library, you'll be able to browse, download and play holographic content inside your Looking Glass with a single click.  \nAt launch, the App Library will include about three dozen holographic applications that the Looking Glass Factory have developed as a small sample of created for you to experience inside a Looking Glass. We expect this to grow to hundreds of applications! \nJellyfish application created by Maria Mishurenko and Gordy Chernyy\nConnect 2 Looking Glasses together!\nThe Looking Glass won the AWEsome Award at the Augmented World Expo 2018 this past June and an earlier iteration of the technology was a 2018 finalist at the SXSW Interactive Innovation Awards \u2018SciFi No Longer\u2019 category. \nBlue Whale by Bohdan Lvov via Sketchfab\nCirca 2015 with our very first volumetric display prototype!\nAssembling the very first Looking Glass to early beta partners and artist superfriends!\nOne of the test assembly rooms inside the Looking Glass Hong Kong Lab\nA batch of advance beta units ready for shipment.\nPLAY\n\n Looking Glass Factory's holographic displays facilitate shared experiences with virtual content in the real world. In our vision of the future, technology doesn't isolate us. It makes our human connections stronger.  \nLooking Glass Factory is a team of inventors, engineers, game devs, artists and candlestick makers. Together, we're realizing the cinematic dream of the hologram we were all promised in Star Wars, Big Hero 6, Minority Report and Iron Man.  \nWe're headquartered in a restored glass factory in Greenpoint, Brooklyn with our very own R&D hardware team based inside an old industrial building in Hong Kong. Curious to come see for yourself? Say hello future@lookingglassfactory.com  ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs with all new technologies, particularly when they involve new hardware, there are considerable risks in bringing a new invention like the Looking Glass from the lab into the world.\n\nOur previous experience designing, producing, and shipping thousands of units of early generation volumetric displays and specialized interactive lightfield dev kits over the past four years makes us better prepared to do this than the average startup. We also have offices both in Brooklyn, NY for software development and a lab in Hong Kong for hardware prototyping and short-run production -- with that proximity to our manufacturer in mainland China further reducing the risks of missed timing on shipments.\n\nWe've also produced around 100 early beta Looking Glasses over the past few months. This has let us work out most of the bugs in the Looking Glass in advance to a greater degree than is typical.\n\nOn the financing side of things, we are backed by the same investors that backed Formlabs, Makerbot, Sphero, Occipital (creators of the Structure Sensor), giving us the funds that we need to ensure all orders in this launch are fulfilled.\n\nThat all said, our familiarity with producing hardware makes us respectful of the ever-present possibility of unpleasant surprises, either in supply chain availability of a critical component or the delay of an unexpected certification for a particular country. Our error in these areas could result in delays.\n\nOur target is to ship the Rush Beta Looking Glasses by the end of September and to ship the regular orders by mid-December this year. We are obsessed with hitting this deadline but will let you know if anything changes for any reason.\n\nAll of us in Looking Glass Factory have been working towards this moment for the past four years and we're so excited to get Looking Glasses onto the desks of all the 3D creators of the world.\n\nTo the future!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "Friend of the Hologram!", "descp": "Thanks for believing in the future!

Players strategically place randomly-drawn Meeples from a bag on and around the cloth board, aiming to jump the shore Meeples over their color of Meeples, which float in the center. It is very fast, and while pushing your luck plays into it strongly, there is a healthy dose of strategy that makes the game fun to play over and over in casual settings. With its elegant cloth and hardwood components, it's just as at home in a fancy pub as it is on your gaming table.\nBacking at the $20 MeepFrog level will get you not only the 18 assorted painted Meeples you need to play the game, but also a cloth bag to play with featuring the Copper Frog Games logo, and a classy screen-printed, handkerchief-style board with the instructions.\nFor more on how to play MeepFrog, check out this preview from Pirate's Parley Gaming-- note that the Meeples used in this video are not the final component quality of our painted poplar Meeples.\nWho is making this happen?\nCopper Frog Games LLC is led by Michael Epstein of Lexington, MA. After Kickstarting Pigment successfully in Fall 2017, he had the idea to produce custom wooden Meeples as a convention-exclusive item, after the popularity of the custom Apprentice Meeples unlocked for that game on Kickstarter. Pigment successfully shipped on time to backers in Spring 2018, and Michael is now proud to present an abstract strategy game in the form of MeepFrog this summer at our $1500 stretch goal.\nPerfect for use with Pigment, Lords of Waterdeep, Carcassonne and more!\nEric Badger possesses the tools and skills necessary to make this project a reality. As our expert \"Meeple Maker\" based out of Montpelier, VT, Eric brings his woodworking knowledge and craftsman's spirit to this Kickstarter campaign, and wants to see this project grow over the coming years with new Meeples and other wooden gaming components for all. Look for him at more conventions with Copper Frog Games soon!\nEric making Meeples in June\nOur video was shot on-location in Warren, Vermont and produced by Jason Martin, and The Meeple Machine jingle was created by Tom Sargent, featuring vocals by Emily Bawn.\nThe funds from this Kickstarter will primarily be going towards shipping rewards, hardwoods and other materials such as paint, The Meeple Machine itself, reimbursements for tools and other necessary equipment, and Pledge Manager costs. As well, if we reach the MeepFrog stretch goal, we will be ordering custom-printed cloth bags and boards to ship with those games.\nHow will these be available after the Kickstarter?\nThe Meeple Machine is going to be a capsule machine filled with our handmade Meeples, presented by Copper Frog Games LLC. We hope to bring this to many conventions around the country, starting with PAX Unplugged in November 2018, but need your help to make it happen with style! We are offering a chance to get first-batch and exclusive Meeples through this Kickstarter, and hope you are excited to eventually visit The Meeple Machine at conventions throughout the US.\nLook for our Meeples at Connecticon, at the Sherwood Games booth July 13-14!\nWhat about retail backers?\nIf you are interested in purchasing Meeples for bulk retail opportunities in brick-and-mortar stores or game cafes, or for deluxe components for use in board games, please back at our Bulk Meep! x100 level and send us a message via Kickstarter with information about your business. From there, we will work out pledge details for those orders. We may even be able to offer custom woods or paint options for large bulk orders (500-1000+ Meeples) if there is interest--perhaps we'll see our Meeples in a deluxe version of your game in the future!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe've already been producing Meeples for about a month now to prepare for this Kickstarter launch, ensuring that we are delivering excellent quality products for you on-time and on-budget. Thanks to the small size and low weight of Meeples, we can ship rewards very quickly and easily once production is completed. All domestic shipping is factored into the reward tiers already, with international shipping being affordably priced as well.\n\nOur low funding goal reflects our confidence in being able to get Meeples to you for a good price, and our interest in spreading the good word of hardwood gaming components. We have perfected our process over numerous batches of Meeples, and hope to make this an integral part of our convention appearances in the near future with your help.\n\nHaving delivered Pigment largely on time in Spring 2018, Copper Frog Games is excited to be returning to Kickstarter with The Meeple Machine. Manufacturing is going to proceed at our own pace, and we're ready to take on any challenges that may crop up as we get you your rewards. Our hope is to ship early, but as with our last Kickstarter, we will keep you informed of any problems or delays in getting you your rewards.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Meeple Jingle", "descp": "Get a digital download of \"The Meeple Machine\" jingle, perfect as a ringtone or notification on your phone!

What's the point of doing just an extra 5 or 10 minutes?...when we can aim to do a 20 minute version?! In order to make a 20 minute animation, we will need to raise $380,000! And if we all want an awesome\n45 minutes version, then we will need to raise $800,000 for that goal! Can we do it?\n I know we can, the BEAN BANDIT family is awesome!\nThe reason the Bean Bandit Project is being financed by crowd funding is because the Japanese animation industry does not understand the real potential of the series. And another reason is that I want to write a brand new original intense action packed story in the way that drew the fans into the series in the first place!\nI truly appreciate the BEAN BANDIT family's love and support for this kickstarter project! I believe it's our dream to make this animation even longer than just a mere 5 minute long! Onegai shimasu! I promise I will make sure this project will be developed with the highest animation standard & to live up to your even higher expectations!\nKenichi Sonoda\nThree types of Fabric Posters rough sketch.\nMore maniac! More extreme!\nMy name is Kenichi Sonoda, the original creator of Riding Bean and Gunsmith Cats, and I want to make an ambitious Bean Bandit animation without focusing on profit.

Burn! Let\u2019s make it all into an anime!\nBEAN BANDIT RALLY BUFF\nFor the Fans and What I Want to Make\nEvery time I am invited to events in North America, I am always left with the memory that fans want a new Riding Bean and Gunsmith Cats. One day, my friend brought me a plan for crowdfunding anime. I realized then how fun it would be to make more extreme and more profound animated works just for the fans without being bound by the opinions of publishers and editors.\nThat is why I started this Kickstarter.\nOur initial goal is to produce a five-minute animation. Should we receive more support, we are planning to make it longer. I would be truly happy if we gathered enough pledges to create a 20-minute anime with a slick original opening!\nI also intend to prepare an art book featuring concept art, design, and a newly drawn original color comic if possible.\nThe animation, art book, and manga will be available in both Japanese and English. Additionally, the finished animation will be released on a Blu-ray disk at the highest quality.\nOur Vision\nI am announcing this project at Anime Central 2018, and when our team finishes this project, we will hold a screening at Anime Central 2019 and hold a fan Q and A.\nIf possible, I would like Bean Bandit to become a new animation series or even a movie to add its world and create more spectacular scenes.\nNew! Design sketch: Bean Bandit\nCHARACTERS\nBean Bandit\nBEAN BANDIT.Designed by KENICHI SONODA\nAge unknown. Real name unknown.\nA legendary courier-for-hire also known as \"Roadbuster,\u201d Bean Bandit can deliver anything and everything anywhere, but only at a high price. He won't tolerate anyone standing in his way or betraying him, and when faced with such a challenge he removes them with his strength and muscles. Bean Bandit is a man of honor. Since the underworld society considers him trustworthy, he receives job offers from many shady customers.\nParticular about the cars he drives, Bean Bandit not only rides around in his custom monster machine \u201cthe Buff\u201d but also has several other cars including a '69 Chevrolet Corvette. He also is a racing maniac and can\u2019t refuse a challenge to a race.\nRally Vincent\nRally Vincent.Designed by KENICHI SONODA\nBean's buddy and roommate.\nShe also works as Bean Bandit\u2019s manager and does not have a romantic relationship with him. A gun maniac with expert marksmanship, she is a good contrast with Bean\u2019s car mania.\nMinnie May\nMinnie May.Designed by KENICHI SONODA\nA girl who insists she is over 18-years-old. Although Minnie looks like an innocent little girl, she is actually an explosives specialist. She is very familiar with gunpowder and bombs and always hides a wide range of explosive weapons under her coat. Minnie is a real bomb maniac who is excited at the site of explosions.\nAbout the Staff\nRecently, the number of success stories about teams that create anime with a select team of staff has increased. There are many up-and-coming Japanese animation studios with that system that have been successful in both business and creative work!\nRather than gathering the opinion of many people, I want to produce this project like these studios with a few key staff members.\nMany wonderful works have lost their \u201csoul\u201d through commercialism-busy line operations and cost-cutting, high-efficiency demands-and I want to prevent such a thing from happening with this project. (This is not to say that large organizations kill a good idea, but I want to say it is reasonable to scale the team according to the budget.)\nAs of now, I have already constructed our outsourcing system. Subcontracted companies will take care of large-scale processes like recording, backgrounds, and CGs.\nStaff, Supporter, Advisor\nShujiro Hamakawa: Animator Born 7th July, 1966 in Kobe City, Hyogo Prefecture Work History 1989: Planner and character designer for Konami Digital Entertainment Co., Ltd. 1998: Transferred to Production I.G. 2001: Started freelance career, working mainly with GONZO.

It will also be the most beautiful design object you will ever have for your home or office, so please help us make it happen.\nNATEDE is a beautiful Natural Air Purifier for any home or office, and behind its simple design it features a complex and innovative technology.\nNATEDE has the most advanced sensors and it leverages a new photocatalytic filter, which does not need to be replaced, eliminating waste and extra expenses.\nThanks to the combination of the plant with this innovative filter, this air purifier successfully eliminates 93% of VOCs, 99% of bacteria, viruses, fine-particulate and odors.\nNATEDE works with its dedicated app that allows users to monitor air pollutants and control the air flow in their space in real time. NATEDE can even connect to other smart home devices.\nWhy Stephen Croncota, former Chief Marketing Officer at VERSACE is now Advisor for Vitesy\nTake control of your environment, care about the people you love. \nNew Stretch Goal!\nWhen we hit 650k euro in funding you will have the opportunity to choose between 2 new wonderful colors! \nA big thanks to everyone who helped us hit our first stretch goal of \u20ac400,000!\nAll NATEDE backers will now be able to add one or more NATEDE Luxury Wooden Stand to their NATEDE pre-orders. And everyone will now be able to get access to a new Super Early Bird offer that includes both a NATEDE air purifier and a NATEDE stand.\nMade with the finest wood, the NATEDE Luxury Wooden Stand is specifically designed for the NATEDE Air Purifier to add an extra touch of design to your home or office. It does not require glue or screws, it requires only two steps to assemble it.\n                                                          The monitors and sensors inside NATEDE can accurately measure the temperature and humidity of a room, as well as detect pollutants (VOCs), fine-particulates (PM2.5), and carbon monoxide (CO).\nNATEDE Premium will also include an additional sensor for carbon dioxide (CO\u2082).\nThe new NATEDE mobile app (available for iOS and Android) allows users to monitor the air quality in their space. NATEDE connects to your home or office Wi-Fi, so you can manage NATEDE from everywhere. It features also Bluetooth, which makes the first connection and setup much easier.\nNATEDE\u2019s mobile app dashboard shows real-time monitoring of the IAQ (Internal Air Quality). The wave frequency changes depending on the IAQ levels.\nFrom the mobile app it\u2019s possible to manage NATEDE\u2019s fan speed and select one of the four available operating modes.\nIt's also possible to see a detailed breakdown of the pollutants in your environment.\nNATEDE\u2019s app features a Statistics section where you can monitor the levels of the measured elements such as humidity, temperature, VOCs, PM2.5 and CO. Premium users will also be able to monitor CO\u2082 levels.\nWhen NATEDE detects high levels of pollutants in the air, its app will send a notification and it will ask for information on your activity to better understand your habits and tailor the experience to your needs.\nThe core technology of NATEDE is phytoremediation, which means that it uses the natural power of common plants to clean toxins in the air. This was studied by NASA in the \u201980s and implemented by Vitesy with almost 3 years of research at PNAT and LINV, two of the most important laboratories on plants neurobiology in the world. \nPlants placed in NATEDE metabolize a significantly higher amount of pollutants as opposed to plants potted in regular vases given that the air purification process happens throughout the whole plant, including its roots.\nNATEDE also features a new and improved technology unit that supercharges this effect.\nNATEDE combines phytoremediation with a new incredible filtration process: photocatalysis. \nNATEDE's superpowers come from the so-called photocatalysis: light energy kick-starts a process that zaps all kinds of nasty air pollutants and turns them into harmless substances instead.\nFor people who suffer from asthma and allergies, the NATEDE light-powered air purifier is a great ally to breathe clean air and improve your health.\nThe photocatalytic filter inside NATEDE can capture and eliminate VOCs, viruses and bacteria, and it can significantly alleviate odors from pets, cigarettes and cigars, cooking, mildew, etc.\nAnd the best part of photocatalysis is that this filter does not need any replacement!\nNATEDE\u2019s technology has been scientifically tested\nPLANTS\nIt\u2019s now more than 3 years that we have been testing our products and our technology. Our main partners are PNAT and LINV, the most prestigious research labs on plants neurobiology in Europe, both spin-offs of the University of Florence, Italy. PNAT and LINV proved the effectiveness of our system and work closely with us to improve our products.\nResults from 2016 PNAT/LINV analysis\nAdditional 2017/2018 PNAT/LINV analysis\nFLUID DYNAMICS\nAfter the success of our first Kickstarter campaign back in 2016, we started working with fluid dynamics engineers to perfect the airflow and to improve the purification range. NATEDE has an incredible purification range and guarantees a perfect and silent air flow.\nSee results\nPHOTOCATALYSIS\nPhotocatalysis is a natural process by which the light strikes a mineral (titanium dioxide - TiO\u2082 - a common mineral) and activates a chemical process that securely and instantaneously oxidizes and decomposes the organic matter at the molecular level to form water vapor and small parts of carbon dioxide. The combination of photocatalysis with the plant is just perfect and guarantees a great improvement in performance.\nCenter of Industrial Microbiology Test Report 2018\nComparing NATEDE to other air filtering\n                                                          Vitesy's technology has 3 worldwide patent pending applications.\nPLAY\n\nHaving a NATEDE means you can lay back and relax: the NATEDE app lets you take control of the air you breathe, hassle-free.\nWhether you are cooking, working, relaxing or sleeping, you can select the right functioning mode of your NATEDE.\nYou will be able to save energy while you are not at home with its night mode, or boost its fan while you are preparing those yummy recipes with performance mode.\nAnd if you need a good sleep to be ready for an intense day tomorrow, just make sure you breathe good air during the night.\nThe Internet of Things (IoT) is a scenario in which objects, devices, and sensors are given the ability to transfer data over a network without requiring human-to-human or human-to-computer interaction.\nNATEDE can connect to other smart home devices, such as Amazon Alexa and Google Home, who will directly report the quality of the air you breathe and will be able to manage it with voice commands.\nNATEDE features a proximity sensor that lets you turn it ON an OFF by simply moving your hand close to it. NATEDE is science, but you can do your little magic here.\nNATEDE features an intuitive LED guide that lets you see the quality of your air without checking the app.\nNATEDE features a self-watering system, which helps to further reduce water consumption \u2013 in addition to keeping plants alive while we are on the move or on long holidays - its water tank can bring water to plants for about a month.\nNATEDE's new photocatalytic filter, combined with the increased efficiency of the air flow, will also reduce smoke, cooking, and bathroom odors.\nNATEDE has a green soul: it is Made in Italy with sustainable materials often derived from natural waste. \nAt Vitesy, we are committed to a green lifestyle, we respect our planet, and while NATEDE purifies your air from harmful elements that can affect your health we are keen on avoiding an impact on our planet. \nThis is why we spent 2 years looking for the best combination of these materials.\nWe have created NATEDE starting from the concept of \"Circular Design Economy\", which refers to a sustainable design that thinks about our future. \nNATEDE is respectful to the environment in multiple ways: in its use of natural materials, in the lack of added harmful glues, and in its sustainable dismantling at the end of its lifecycle. \nAs a Nature-loving company, we leverage nature and we aim to preserve it as best as we can.\nAs a Technology-enabled company, we deliver the best in class of today's most advanced research in a sustainable future where Economy is based on Circular Design.\nAs a Design company, we are keen on thinking about your health and your future, while delivering a beautiful design object that will enrich your home, office, and your well-being.\nNATEDE Premium is made of ceramic and handcrafted by the best Venetian artisans.\nFor Kickstarter only, we are creating a Special Limited Edition. Every single NATEDE will be numbered and you will have a unique piece of Italian design. A series number will be put at the bottom of each NATEDE.\nNATEDE comes in 2 versions, regular and Premium, each one in 2 available colors, all able to adapt to any home or office style.\nPick your favorite color to enhance your own home or office style.\nNATEDE\nNATEDE comes with a power cord which plugs into the power outlet, and adapter.\n                                                                      What about NATEDE\u2019s production, logistics and shipping?\nAfter launching a first product in 2016, Vitesy has created an optimised supply chain that takes care of every aspect. Vitesy also secured a worldwide partnership with a leading shipping company \u2013 check out this video to learn more.\nTalking about partners, there\u2019s one we are super proud of: Eden Projects, an NGO that plants trees in developing countries.\nVitesy will donate 10 trees for every NATEDE sold.\nThanks to your support, as of today we have already donated 17,000 trees.\n                                                             Here is the list of our Partners: they are all leaders in their sectors.\n    We would like to thank:  \nAlireza Masrour & Plug and Play Ventures, Gert Gremes, Maria Anita Polese, the European Union, Ganis and Francescutti Family, Allison Romero, Ivana Kuchan, Alberto Rossetti, Michele Carlet & Check Up team, Ezio e Denis Maccan, Intertek, Adexe, Ceramiche ML, Ceramiche Rigoni, Ceramiche BS, Etra, Luca Turri and the TGT Family, Fabio Pivetta, IdealPack, Ranpack, Luca Bodin, Andrea Girotto, Giannattilio Usoni & Felice Fanizza, Adriana Turchet, Alessandro Trentin & Graffiti 2000, Microline, Euroetichette, Gianluca Minuzzi, Paolo Tonus, Marco Pasquin, Marcello Ceseratto, Talent Garden Pordenone taggers, Dario Fasiolo, Milica e Dimitrje, 221e, Carlo Cianfrone, Peter Oei, Quasar Media, Child and Youth Finance International, Andrea Petrussa, Luca Dovigo & Friulovest Banca, Ilenia Tommasini & Intesa San Paolo, SSA Informatica, Giorgio Pertegato, Mattia Attus, Politecnico di Milano, Universit\u00e0 Bocconi, Gabriele Agostinis, Stefano Mancuso, Camilla Pandolfi, Elisa Masi, Diego Comparini, Cosimo Taiti, Mauro Afflisio, Apple Italy, Serena Stramandinoli & Accenture, Il Posto di Follador, Shis Pordenone, Gennaro e Signora, Samanta Scaini, Daniele Boltin, Yassi Taromi, Valeria Boldrin, Katerina Ermolina, Valeria Galbiati e Gaetano Diodato.\nSpecial thanks to Kristalia.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOur Mission\nWe\u2019ve set out to highlight the necessity of green ethics and to increase your quality of life by developing simple products that combine innovative technologies with incredible design.\n\nWhy Kickstarter? \nThanks to our first Kickstarter Campaign we created a well-structured company and now we are ready to launch a new product.

Gunsmith Cats is a semi-reboot of Mr. Sonoda's Riding Bean manga, which was also made into an anime (and previously released by us using Kickstarter).\nUnusually for anime, Gunsmith Cats is set in the United States -- specifically, Chicago. Rally Vincent and her friend May Hopkins run a gun-shop and moonlight as bounty hunters, which often put them at odds with both the local underworld and the local law (especially since May has a great affection for high explosives).\nIn this 3-episode OVA, Rally and May are blackmailed by a slimy ATF agent into helping him bust some gunrunners, but things rapidly get out of hand when they run afoul of a shadowy mastermind and a psychotic Russian hitwoman!\nAbout the Crowdfunding Campaign\nThis is the fourth anime-related limited-edition HD 1080p Blu-ray set that we've released using Kickstarter. You can find out more about the campaigns and see all sorts of interesting production materials by checking out our wiki.\nPlease note that our license for Gunsmith Cats is Worldwide excluding Japan and Germany, English-only. We are not able to ship into those countries, or do subtitles in other languages.\nOur goal for these sets is to use crowdfunding as a method of delivering the maximum possible value to our backers, and tailor the sets to their preferences. Wherever practical, we solicit feedback from the backers during the production process.\nEach time we do a project, we like to experiment with new ways of doing things. This time we are playing around with individual customization, by providing a set of Core Rewards plus additional Bonus Goodies. Think of the Core Rewards as your entree, and the Bonus Goodies as side-orders. This way you can get exactly what you want, no more and no less.\nCore Rewards\nATF Case File backers ($5) get access to the online data archive, which includes high-resolution graphics and preproduction materials, and you can order bonus goodies! All higher-level rewards also include this reward.\nBasic backers ($30) get a region-free BD50 Blu-ray in a premium transparent Amaray case with a reversible sleeve, so there will be two cover variants to choose from, and a 9-panel printed insert with liner notes and a mini-poster. There is no \"early-bird\" level because everyone is getting early-bird pricing -- we don't want anyone to feel like they missed out.\nIncluded on the disc are:\nAll 3 episodes (~90 minutes total) in a high-bitrate encode from a new 1080p HD transfer.\nAmaray case with reversible cover sleeve.\n9-panel insert with new original art poster.\nJapanese stereo (uncompressed) and English stereo & 5.1 (ac3) audio.\nColor, SDH and traditional caption subtitles (see below).\nArtwork slideshow.\nClean opening credits.\nReconstructed HD trailers.\nMusic Video.\nUpdated and expanded HD version of the DVD Production Documentary with new material and interviews.\nJapanese commentary featuring Gunsmith Cats creator Sonoda Ken'ichi, Arai Masahiro, and Kaza'ana Takanori.\nJapanese commentary track featuring Gunsmith Cats director Mori Takeshi and Sat\u014d Hiroki.\nEnglish commentary (from the DVD release) for Episode 1 featuring Matt Greenfield (English voice director) and Tiffany Grant (voice actor of Becky).\nEnglish commentary track for Episode 2 featuring Bennett the Sage and Marc Swint.\nAll Basic-level backers and above will be listed in a special list of supporters on the disc and on the 9-panel insert!\nHow-to-draw tutorial: Mr. Sonoda will show us how he draws a character from Gunsmith Cats.\nTo give you a taste of the quality of the new HD transfer, here's what it looks like compared to the DVD transfer:\n(This is a GIF so please forgive the compression artifacts)\nPremium backers ($60) get the BD50 Blu-ray in a chipboard case along with a special softcover Dojinshi/Artbook that contains both original production color art, over 100 settei reference drawings, and new artwork by Mr. Sonoda and new Gunsmith Cats dojinshi by Mr. Sonoda and invited guest manga artists.\nThe case, artbook and disc from the Otaku no Video project, and an annotated settei page from Riding Bean\nPatron backers ($150) get everything in the Premium package plus 3 bonus goodies, and in addition they are listed in a special patronage list that appears each time the disc loads.\nProminent Patron backers ($250) receive everything Patrons do, but also get priority placement on the first page of the Patrons list.\nVocal Patron backers ($300) receive everything Patrons do, but also get a special hardcover variant of the large artbook that is signed and numbered by voice actors Amanda Winn Lee & Kimberly Yates.\nSignature Patron backers ($400) receive everything Patrons do, but also get a special hardcover variant of the large artbook that is signed and numbered by Mr. Sonoda.\nPerfectionist Patron backers ($500) receive everything Patrons do, plus they get one of the production check discs to review (and keep)!  As the last people to see the disc before it goes into full replication, if there are any mistakes, it's their fault!\nInscribed Patron backers ($600) receive everything Patrons do, but also get a special hardcover variant of the large artbook that is signed and numbered by Mr. Sonoda and also contains a personalized sketch and inscription.\nSample hardcover artbook variant and sketch w/signature produced for the Otaku no Video set\nIf you really love Gunsmith Cats, we have 4 Line Drawing and 2 Color Illustration rewards that will reward you with the original artwork created for this release, signed by Mr. Sonoda. These rewards will slowly reduce in price until they are snapped up. \nSample artwork from previous projects\nRough Sketches for New Gunsmith Cats Original Art\nFinally, we have the Supervillain reward. You not only get original signed color artwork by Mr. Sonoda, you get design input into its creation -- and then you get to decide if you want to share it with the rest of the backers (as a poster) or keep it hidden away in your secret lair! In addition, you will appear on the packaging and in a secret disc Easter Egg. We'll even include some extra copies of the Blu-ray for you to give to your Minions!\nNote: Lair and minions not included.\nBonus Goodies\nEach bonus goodie is $8.00, which includes shipping. You can order as many as you want (within reason!), and you can order multiples of any goodie. During the Kickstarter itself, you can order the ATF Case Files, Basic, and Premium sets with various numbers of extra goodies (Patron and above come with 3 as a default); after the campaign ends we'll have an easy way for you to add-on extra sets and more goodies.\nOur current list of goodies includes:\nMatched Pair of Patches - two matching embroidered patches featuring Rally Vincent and Minnie May (the design is evolving, we may go with a single larger \"playing card\" patch)\n1.5\" Good vs. Evil Challenge Coin featuring Rally and Radinov.\n1.5\" Keychain (the coin with keychain fob added)\nFrom May With Love Grenade Pin - a hand-painted pink hand-grenade pin.\nLarge Softcover Artbook - a larger 8.5x11\" version of the dojinshi/artbook that fits in the chipboard case; 40+ pages with an emphasis on color artwork. Counts as 3 goodies.\nAll of these items are being produced exclusively for this edition and will only be available to backers.\nSamples of goodies produced for previous projects\nAdd-ons\nWe will handle extra add-ons after the main campaign ends; it's just easier to do things that way given how Kickstarter currently works. You'll be able to add extra copies of any item or goodie, upgrade to a higher backer level, and so on. You will be able to adjust your order until we finally lock down for production.\nFan Art Contest!\nWe are pleased to announce that Mr. Sonoda has agreed to act as the judge of a Gunsmith Cats Fan Art Contest! Winners will get their artwork showcased in the Dojinshi/Artbook and included on the disc and in the ATF Case Files -- and win Patron-level reward packages! You do not need to be a project backer to enter the contest. Complete rules can be found here.\nAll 8 Stretch Goals Have Been Unlocked!\n$100,000 - Commentary track featuring Gunsmith Cats creator Sonoda Ken'ichi, Arai Masahiro, and Kaza'ana Takanori.\n$125,000 - New 4-page Gunsmith Cats manga by Mr. Sonoda, included on a second 9-panel insert and in the Dojinshi/Artbook. Also unlocks 3 Cannon Fodder rewards that will put your likeness in the manga (probably dying horribly) as well as one of the original manga pages and all the Prominent Patron perks. Please note we can't guarantee you'll get a manga page with your likeness on it.\nSample original Manga created for the Riding Bean project (5 of 8 pages)\n$160,000 - Commentary track featuring Gunsmith Cats director Mori Takeshi and Sat\u014d Hiroki.\n$190,000 - English commentary track for Episode 2 featuring Bennett the Sage and Marc Swint.\n$200,000 - Extra Bonus Goal to celebrate rolling the odometer! Postcard added to each set!\n$210,000 - How-to-draw tutorial: Mr. Sonoda will show us how he draws a character from Gunsmith Cats.\n$225,000 - Sticker sheet added to each set.\n$300,000 - English commentary track for Episode 3 featuring voice actors Amanda Winn Lee and Kimberly Yates!\nAll additional pledges collected (both during the Kickstarter campaign and for several months post-campaign) will contribute towards an additional Backer's Choice feature. Based on the total amount, we'll work up several possible alternatives and put it up for discussion and a vote.\nShipping Details\nOn this project, we're charging a shipping fee on all orders, as opposed to giving US backers \"free\" shipping (which isn't really free, it's just bundled in). One reason we're doing this is because it helps establish the correct customs value for international shipments.\nThe shipping charges are:\nBasic Sets:\nUS: $6.\nElsewhere: $15.\nPremium Sets (and higher levels or multiple sets):\nUS: $7.\nElsewhere: $25.\nCustoms costs, VAT and \"processing fees\" are a major annoyance for international backers, and we want to do everything we can to minimize or eliminate this hassle. That's why we're pleased to announce that this project is EU and Canada-friendly.\nThis means that we'll be shipping copies directly to fulfillment houses in Canada and the UK (who will then reship to backers in the EU -- except Germany of course; if Brexit causes any complications, we'll also use a third EU-based fulfillment service).\nShipping costs have had to rise since our previous projects because of increased costs. In particular, USPS First Class Mail International rates have been relentlessly rising over the past several years.\nNote that the shipping cost is a flat rate; if you later add on extra sets or goodies, the maximum shipping cost is the Premium Set cost.\nWe will ship to non-CA/EU international backers directly from the USA using USPS International First Class Mail. For many countries, the value of your set should be below the personal exemption amount, so you may escape duty, taxes, and processing fees. As of the last time we checked, backers in the following countries should not need to worry about customs fees:\nPremium backers: Australia, New Zealand.\nBasic backers: Norway (barely), Switzerland.\nYour help in making this list more comprehensive/accurate is appreciated. Please note that exchange rates (and rules!) may change between now and when we ship.\nSubtitle Styles\nWe are expanding the range of subtitle options for this release. First, we will have multicolored subtitles (in both regular and SDH variants) for the Japanese audio track. Main characters will have a unique subtitle color that will be consistent over all 3 OVAs.\nThe colors have been adjusted to be even more color-blind friendly. In addition, there will be monochrome caption SDH subtitle tracks (similar to what you'd see on Netflix) for both the Japanese and English audio tracks.\nAll commentary tracks with have multicolored subtitles with each commentator having his or her own color.\nCommentary Questions\nBacker participation and feedback is a big part of all of our special Blu-ray editions. Got a question about Gunsmith Cats you'd like answered? Email it to crowdfunding@animeigo.com with subject \"GSC Commentary Questions\" and we'll pass it on -- your question might get answered on one of the commentary tracks!\nCombat Archaeology\nFor a vintage anime like Gunsmith Cats, sometimes original artwork and production materials are not easily available. You can help -- if you have (or know of someone who has) original materials, please get in touch at crowdfunding@animeigo.com.\nShout-outs\nWe would like to express our heartfelt thanks to Sonoda Ken'ichi, John Ledford, Janice Williams, Ogawa Y\u016bko, Kawaguchi Junko, Kanai Azusa and Sat\u014d Hiroki for their generous assistance in assembling the materials for this release.\nCopyrights\nAll original Gunsmith Cats anime artwork and video in this campaign are \u00a91995 Kenichi Sonoda/Kodansha, VAP, TBS.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhile we should be able to meet or beat the March 2019 release date, a video production project such as this can suffer unexpected delays. In particular, one side-effect of the excellent feedback we get from backers is that we expect a certain amount of \"feature creep\" as people come up with great ideas that \"simply must be done\", and these tend to stretch the schedule a bit.\n\nOur policy is that when a critical-path item causes a delay, we use that extra time to try and improve other aspects of the project. All of our previous projects have ended up shipping a few months late (each time for new and \"interesting\" reasons), but what we ended up shipping was better than what it would have been if we'd hit our schedule.\n\nThe bottom line is that we will take the time to get things right, even if that means slipping the release date, and that we will keep you fully informed every step of the way -- we typically post updates every couple of weeks.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "ATF Case Files", "descp": "Digital download of high-resolution artwork and production materials.\nINCLUDES:\nATF Case Files Download", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2019"}], "stat": ["61 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 13 or more", "title": "ATF Case Files + 1 Goodie", "descp": "Digital download of high-resolution artwork and production materials.

The response and feedback was excellent - reinforcing the key elements of our development path.  More details, including the supportive quotes of Boston VR founders will be included in our upcoming Update Post.  On 12/14/17, we will be back at Autodesk Boston demonstrating the AR4 E and three of the possible configurations.\nWe are excited to share this innovative, multi-purpose, Smart Phone headset for both true AR and VR and to prove it is the best $25 AR/VR headset available.  Our innovative optics and technology cushions the Smart Phone close to the forehead, minimizing the forces; and enables full screen, high resolution NetFlix and 2D Games, while enabling adjustable offset, stereoscopic Virtual Reality.  \nWith Augmented Reality, real world games and interactions are safe and free of disorienting artifacts.  Add a real or virtual keyboard and one can easily program and prototype in a single step.  Unity, Android Studio, ARKit among others are all directly compatible.    \nFor those mesmerized by legacy, stereoscopic View-Master VR, we provide a simple, reversible, 30 second transformation into the standard VR format with a wider field of view.\nAR4 is not only the perfect entry point at the best possible price - a low-cost, easy to use, foldable, and lightweight head-mounted display enabling AR/VR wherever you are, but also the most cost-effective, productive, multi-modal programmers and makers tool.\nYour support and feedback will help us perfect our next levels of molded AR4 Ultra HeadSets - and reward you with Special, First Adopter Status and Discounts on our future projects.  \nOur Initial Goal is $5000, enabling the cost saving, die cutting of the cardboard.\nIf you are going to back a project, we are offering limited quantities of headsets to Kickstarter Early Adopters! Five hundred (500) of the AR4 M headsets, and five hundred (500) of the AR4 E headset will be available for this campaign to help us meet our goal.   \nYou will be helping us build the first step in a line of tech that ends with lightweight AR glasses that fit naturally into our daily lives.\n    INTRO ON AR/VR\nAR and VR have been with us since the late 1800s, with Pepper's Ghost taking the stage in 1862 and the early forms of the View-Master in 1919 (Barrier stereoscopes were even earlier.)   \nIn true \u201cAugmented Reality\u201d (AR), one overlays one\u2019s normal view of the external environment with virtual images and data - from the simple text display of the time and date in the upper margin, to a complex integration of the practical recognition of every object, to a world of fantasy and games, populating one\u2019s view. True AR maintains one\u2019s normal balance and perspective, and thus inherently is the safest way to interact with the real world.\nVirtual Reality (VR), on the other hand, creates a full visual immersion in a simulated environment. This allows for complete control over the user's visual input. With no view of the surrounding world you lose the perception of being in the space you are in and \u201cfeel\u201d transported to the visual representation presented. Content in the form of games, tours, simulations, and video all become first-person for the user. This viewing experience blocks out the real world and isolates you in the headset for a fantastic experience.\nSO WHAT ABOUT OUR HEADSET?\nAR For Everyone evolved from our decades of professional experience in biophysics, vision, entertainment, robotics, computer graphics, art, and sculpture.\nThe 1862 optical illusion (Pepper's Ghost) at the core our first AR/VR experiments at MIT in the 1980s using Sony Camcorder displays and our early catadioptric designs. This experimentation path is evident in the optics and periscope of our AR4 M and AR4 E headsets.\nAs diehard fans of View-Master stereography, we replaced the slides with miniature LCD displays - the current design used by most major tethered headsets. The use of the smartphone - now popularized as Google Cardboard - is a simple variation on this design.\nWhen developing the AR4 headsets, we were able to leverage decades of experiments and the power of the smartphone to create a hybrid headset that functions exceptionally well for both viewing modes.\nOur headset allows for a view of the world and the AR data layer. With a simple Velcro flap, we block out light for mobile VR experiences.\nTHE AR FOR EVERYONE PLATFORM\nAR4 M & AR4 E are flexible hybrid headsets for viewing AR/VR content.\nThis means that Augmented Reality (AR) content in the form of games, data, and feedback can be placed in a display near the eyes, allowing the wearer to see the real world around them - as well as what is on the display. Imagine your flat screen TV floating in the world around you as you watch it. This headset also accommodates for Virtual Reality (VR), allowing a user to block out the real world and focus in only on the display. VR gives a full immersive view of a game, data, or video, with the user having no feedback from the outside world. Our design allows for both viewing experiences, and can use stereo and mono viewing modes depending on your content.\nUsing the headset to lounge and watch YouTube is a excellent experience. Another experiment used Google Maps to navigate around town via walking directions. This provided safe viewing of surroundings as well as the map's navigation. When paired with a VR remote or Bluetooth controller, interaction with content is immediate.\n    \u2018Legacy\u2019 mode enables all existing content. Directly after assembly, all mobile VR and 360 content become available.\n    Our AR4 headsets will accommodate your smartphone and phone camera for AR/VR apps. The AR4 gives you a bright eye-level display projected onto a lens. This ends up placing what seems like a widescreen TV in front of your face, while still allowing you to see the world around you.\nOne of the innovations of this AR/VR headset is the placement of the 'smartphone' vertically close to the forehead. This position moves the center of gravity, reducing the tension in the head strap and allowing lighter materials to be used for the construction.  \nWe enable the phone's main camera with a mini-periscope, allowing access to all camera-based AR apps.\nCurrently, our design folds into a flat pack of around 8\u201d x 10\u201d with a 90-degree viewing angle or 3D view.\nWe have made sure to include access to pre-existing content with a design that accommodates 'Legacy'. This re-positions the mirror and phone for a new wearable form factor.\nLEGACY APPLICATIONS AND GOOGLE CARDBOARD -\nFor many VR/AR enthusiasts and experimenters, Google Cardboard has been the entry point. Taking advantage of the many applications developed for this format, our AR4 is specifically designed to run all Google Cardboard and camera-based apps.\nSPECIAL EVENTS AND ENVIRONMENTS\nThe AR4 may be customized for AR/VR-based specific use cases: events, trade-shows, art experiences, LARPing, and enterprise customers. We have designs using the same optics that cover hard hats, medical shields, bicycle helmets, baseball caps, and lightweight glasses. Sector by sector, we have thought through creating this headset for development and play.\nFUTURE EVOLUTION\nWe are actively in the process of evolving our AR4 cardboard designs into an elegant, durable, molded polymer smartphone headset for permanent use. Our Kickstarter \u2018first adopters\u2019 will have preferred status on all of our future AR4 designs.\nSAFETY AND ADVANTAGES AT LOW COST\nOne of the many advantages of this headset is a safe hands-free, augmented reality experience. In situational games like Pok\u00e9mon Go\u2122, seeing the other players and the game at the same time is now possible. This broadens the use cases for immersive media while allowing the user to see the outside world and maintain their bearings.\nThis is not pseudo or camera AR, which uses a real-time camera image of the external world to reproduce the environment. Monoscopic camera images lack true depth, and even with accurate, dual stereoscopic cameras, one\u2019s vision and comprehension is substantially degraded by the reliance on only image disparity for the stereoscopic effort.\nViewing the real world without camera distortion enhances one's safety and situational awareness. This spares brick walls, bicyclists, baby carriages, and passing BMWs from unnecessary wear.\nOUR KICKSTARTER OFFERING\nWe are coming to the Kickstarter community to raise $5,000 to enable die cutting and our first volume run. This will substantially reduce our cost of manufacture, providing a quality product at an affordable price. We are offering two products initially - both are AR headsets.  \nAR4 M: This is a flat-view headset, giving a widescreen display in a comfortable to wear form factor.  \nAR4 E: This is a hybrid headset, giving a widescreen display and converting to a 3D display in a comfortable to wear form factor.\nWe have presented our operational production prototypes to the founders of Boston's AR/VR community and meetups, receiving an excellent response. Our prototyping has gone well, and we have a few details to finish.\nFinal design accommodations for phones and users\nSelect final materials \nPackage basic starter kits  \nFinalize mono/stereo adaptor \nSource camera periscope \u2013 working prototype must be   adapted to fit multiple phones \nCreate code base for app development \u2013 something to   get you off and running on as many platforms as possible\nThis headset enables all levels of apps and innovation in AR and VR \u2012 camera tracking, GPS positioning, remote control, and hands-free display. One of the strengths we are able to leverage is that kick-ass computer you have in your pocket. These flat-pack AR/VR headsets fold down into something easy to carry. In a few simple steps, you have a headset that holds your phone. This gives you access to the new viewing paradigm without another expensive, bulky piece of tech to carry around \u2013 a durable, reliable AR/VR headset at the lowest cost possible.\nWe all expect that a really cool set of AR glasses will come along, immersing us in our data and machine vision capabilities. This form factor gives us the ability to experiment, play, and design that app landscape now.\nThis project will contribute to the AR landscape. How we compute. How we interact with computers. This is an incredibly exciting time in computing \u2013 join us on this Kickstarter. We can\u2019t wait to see what you create.\nThanks for your attention and support!\nThe AR for Everyone Team\n---------------------------------\nAR for Everyone comes out of a serious design group for holograms and has been at work in the field since the early 80s, moving from fine art displays to DOD work during the last 30 years. Specifically with deep roots at MIT, the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, Massachusetts and MassArt, our team has delivered products from foul weather gear to event lighting, and helped build innovation R&D efforts for Fortune 5 companies.\nDennis Solomon:\nLasers, optics, computers and stereoscopy were among my early interests at MIT, where I was fortunate to learn from and collaborate with both Edwin Land and Steve Benton.  I was later ensnared by biophysics and biomedicine - providing insights in human vision and visual comprehension, and experience with the early VR headsets and near-to-eye displays.  The HoloDeck group coalesced in the 1970s on the deck of our research sailing ketch - Starship - developing technologies in medicine, theatre, defense, entertainment  and education.    \nSteven Taylor:\nI began working in computer 3D in 1999 when Dennis suggested I discover the world of VRML programming. My work has spanned the multimedia field, where I have executed large scale public art, appeared on the National Geographic Channel, and developed graphic novels. In the last decade, I have been a part of a number of start-ups as a marketeer and content creator. I recently built a media and content team within Royal Dutch Shell, where the team has been developing VR content for the energy sector.\nLegal Issues\nThe AR for Everyone Software contains a variant of the MIT Open Software License, and we encourage and support the evolution of diverse, specialized software applications, especially in educational and medicine with a personal focus on Autism and Alzheimers. We encourage researchers in these fields to contact us.  \nMany elements of the AR For Everyone hardware are novel. We have filed and retain all commercial rights including US and international patent rights. We encourage and support educational use, and will be adding special classroom versions and projects.

Raybaby is suitable for infants and toddlers (0-3 years of age)\nThe need for Raybaby arose from you, either a parent of the 21st century, or well-wishers of one. Juggling a world of responsibilities and careers, along with trying to raise a happy, healthy baby is no mean feat. Wonderful, yet exhausting.\nBut sometimes new parents tend to forget just how much path-breaking technology can ease up their lives. And we're here to do exactly that. To help you look beyond baby monitors and toys. To be non-invasive, precise, and adapt tech that even the grandparents would be cool with. :) \nAnd we'd love to show you how!\nThrough a technology that works on the principles of ultrasound, it NOTIFIES you when the baby is running a fever\nRecognizes warning signs and instantly send alerts\nObserves even minute variations if baby has any sort of respiratory illnesses or allergy attacks like Bronchitis or Asthma\nTells you how much your baby has slept \nAnd how much he/she needs to sleep\nAlerts when the baby wakes up or rolls over\nOur sleep recommendation system will help with sleep training of babies\nRaybaby builds up a picture and video collage of your baby's most precious moments. So the next time family and friends come over, you can just show them the very first time he said \"Da-da.\" :)\nWe know how much new moms and dads wish they could constantly keep in touch with their little one - constant reassurance of a parent's voice is an important part of his/her development. Raybaby comes equipped with integrated Infrared video camera which enables live video streaming even in pitch darkness, built in speakers, and audio monitoring that uses a highly sensitive microphone.\nIndicates current mood of the baby\nComprehensive, easy to use information\nProvides helpful tips and recommendations\nNew parents getting time to themselves? A miracle. Remember the last time you baked a cake? Did yoga? Went for date night without being constantly anxious? \nRaybaby wants to change that narrative. Being a parent need not always be supremely stressful. Now you can focus on what really matters, while Raybaby watches over your bundle of joy.\nBuilt on an unparalleled AI platform, Raybaby is intuitive and molded to junior's sleep pattern and respiration. Behind the simple interface is a powerful algorithm that keeps you up-to-date on your baby's REM requirements, and even offers recommendations on how to ensure that her development can be optimized.\nYou've put weeks of effort into the baby room, handpicked the cotton and matched the stuffed toys. Everything looks perfect. So why would you bring home a clunky baby monitor that stands out sore?\nRaybaby has been designed keeping in mind your tastes; inconspicuous, single-wired, and might we say - even elegant. :)\nWith the decision to eliminate harmful batteries, comes the question of emergencies during power failures. Fear not; Raybaby comes with a built in power backup which will last for 3+ hours of operation. Coupled with local connectivityover WIFI/Bluetooth 4.0, and GSM-voice/SMS remote notification feature, you will never be more than a simple tap away from seeing what your baby is up to.\nWe know that most backers won't have the opportunity to experience Raybaby before pledging, but we are confident that you are going to love Raybaby. We will reward your faith in us by offering a 30-day money back guarantee. It\u2019s simple. If you don\u2019t think Raybaby is helping your baby or you, send them back within 30-days for a full refund.\nWhy, of course.\nA- UWB ultra low power Radar that lets us track the respiration rate with an accuracy of 98% \nB- Wood encasing.

Shifting the focus away from the technology itself, it is designed to fit into the context of the child\u2019s room and takes cues from classic wooden toys. This alternative use of materials and figurative approach gives it a warm, friendly character; like a small guardian who tirelessly keeps an eye on the baby.\n Prototypes\nRaybaby is created by 3 engineers (ex-Cornell, ex-University of Georgia, ex-Microsoft). We were the highly qualified baby-sitters for friends and family for the past 10 years. We realized there had to be a better method than putting our hands on the baby's chest or use video surveillance systems or invasive battery operated devices to see if the baby was ok. We believe we can make a difference and make parents' lives a tad easier. We have been working on creating a baby monitor that is better than everything else in the market in terms of design and accuracy and functionality. We were in China with HAX for the past 4 months to create the product. We are supported by Johnson & Johnson and HAX as part of the Consumer health Device program.

They\u2019ll learn about algorithms, loops, conditionals, and more, all while having a blast with their favorite new toy!\n               Plobot helps kids discover coding concepts through physical play. No screens, all fun!\nEasily tell Plobot what to do - just tap the Command Cards to program algorithms, loops, conditionals, and more!  \n      Plobot started from the idea that kids learn best from physical play.\nWith Plobot, we wanted to answer a crucial question: how do we get kids excited to learn about something as abstract as programming? We aimed to create a fun, effortless introduction to coding that promotes productive playtime away from computer screens. That led to Plobot - a happy little robot that can move, sing, dance, and entertain with a few simple commands.\n   Command cards are at the core of the Plobot experience, making every interaction tactile and hands-on. Each Command Card represents a block of code. Tap or swipe them on Plobot\u2019s head to string them together and create a \u2018program\u2019 the robot follows - with the \"play\" card as an execute function. The base set lays the building blocks for controlling Plobot, while our expansion sets allow the robot to grow with your child\u2019s abilities, creating countless possible combinations!\n   There are two distinct types of cards in our base set: Function cards, and Motion cards.\n       Play \u2013 Executes all the steps programmed into Plobot's memory using the Command Cards\nStore \u2013 Records a series of cards to be used with the Repeat card\nReset \u2013 Clears Plobot\u2019s memory to allow a new sequence of cards\nRepeat \u2013 Activates all the steps stored by the Store card\nRainbow \u2013 Treats your child to a brilliant display of colors!\nDance \u2013 Special wild card that makes Plobot dance, sing, and light up in a surprising new way each time this card is used \n        Forward \u2013 Moves one step forward\nBackward \u2013 Moves one step back\nTurn Right \u2013 Turns 90\u00b0 to the right\nTurn Left \u2013 Turns 90\u00b0 to the left\n   Our expansion sets introduce additional entertaining functions and more advanced coding sequences.\n     Color cards can be combined to make Plobot glow all the colors of the rainbow!\n          Modifiers change the effects of other Command Cards, and Sensor cards tell Plobot to wait until it senses an object to carry out the next action. These cards act like conditionals in a programming language.\nBoost \u2013 Boosts the effects of the next Command Card entered \nPause \u2013 stops Plobot in the middle of a sequence \nRandom \u2013 Repeats the previous step a random number of times\nListen - continues to the next entered command if Plobot detects a sound louder than a soft clap\nSee \u2013 continues to the next entered command if Plobot detects an obstacle\nFeel - continues to the next entered command if Plobot is moved or tilted off its axis\n         Plobot's stations act like objective markers for various programming lessons, and help Plobot tell a story. For example, you could have Plobot navigate a path from the Home Station to the Ice Cream Shop Station, listen for permission to get an ice cream, then dance to celebrate when it gets one!\n                Plobot is designed to foster a spirit of creativity in kids, giving them freedom to create and setting them up to be the makers of tomorrow.\n     With up to 50 possible steps in one sequence, dozens of cards and more expansions on the way, the possibilities with Plobot are truly endless. Plobot empowers your child to embrace the future and become a maker of technology, not just a consumer. \n      Plobot is made of easily washable plastic, and our expansion sets even come with stickers to make every robot unique. Kids can mold new shapes with clay, draw on it with pen, or even build crazy formations on its back with Duplo building blocks. Kids love turning Plobot into their own personal spaceship!\n   Starting at a young age is the best way to prepare children for careers in STEM and computer science, and Plobot is the perfect tool.\n     Computational thinking is something most of us use every day to solve all kinds of problems, without even realizing it. It\u2019s all about breaking down complex tasks into a logical sequence of steps to reach an objective. Plobot teaches kids that there are no right and wrong answers when learning code; by breaking down each task into a sequence of steps, they exercise problem solving and creative thinking abilities, while picking up core coding concepts.\n     Plobot is designed to strengthen problem solving and logical reasoning skills, giving your children a head start in programming concepts in an exciting, intuitive way. Imagine the possibilities they\u2019ll unlock as they gain confidence in their mastery of STEM learning and robotics, putting them one step ahead of the curve in school and in life.\n   Plobot helps parents and teachers to make playtime both productive and fun for kids everywhere.\nWe designed a robot that combined decades of education research with core programming concepts. We\u2019ve tested it over many workshops with hundreds of kids all over the world. The one thing our workshops had in common? Everyone loved Plobot!\n    We used our experiences in these workshops to design a custom online teaching guide, with a curriculum centered around Plobot\u2019s abilities. It\u2019s downloadable through your own unique link, and will use our Command Cards and Stations to help you build a lesson plan and teach kids to code. The curriculum fosters creativity, grows with your child\u2019s progress, and takes them on countless adventures with their friend Plobot!\n   Parents, teachers, and kids everywhere love Plobot! We asked some parents and leading professors in the STEM field to share what they thought about our little robot invention. Check out their responses below.\n  PLAY\n\n  PLAY\n\n                         Coming in from Shanghai, Plobot sprung forth from our deep passion for education and the belief that robotics can be the answer. While there has been a lot of focus on teaching programming to children through iPads and computers, Plobot takes a new approach marked by physical programming, with no screens. We've built an educational platform based on different Open Source technologies that can be easily adopted by parents or teachers.  \nIn the middle of 2015, Plobot was accepted into the Make in LA hardware accelerator, receiving huge support and mentorship from the program. We also launched workshops with parents as part of an agreement with Toys R` Us in their \"Explorium\" center.\n      Our team is composed of makers, teachers, toy designers, and illustrators. Plobot's inventor and CEO Rodolfo Cossovich has been tinkering with robotics for years, successfully launching open-source robot platform Multiplo on Kickstarter back in 2012. He currently teaches robotics and animatronics at NYU's Shanghai campus and enjoys playing with his newborn daughter Maxima. Our CTO Sean Purser-Haskell used to work at Google's Mountain View headquarters and now spends most of his time at the local hackerspace XinCheJian - experimenting with ultrasound, high voltage and superconductors. Scott Si is a product manager who is passionate about edtech, leading all marketing and business development efforts as the driving force behind this crowdfunding project.

When I first see MECHA-UDE, I was surprised that is the project of an animator of a young woman. I want you to support for these projects. By the realization of such a project, I think that the total animation industry will be inspired and grow. The same generation of creators as Okamoto bear the future of Japanese animation.\nIl est tr\u00e8s rare que les jeunes animateurs japonais se lancent dans la cr\u00e9ation de leurs propres projets originaux. C\u2019est pour cela que j\u2019ai \u00e9t\u00e9 tr\u00e8s surpris en d\u00e9couvrant que Mecha-ude \u00e9tait la cr\u00e9ation d\u2019une jeune animatrice, Sae Okamoto. Il faut la soutenir! Il est important de supporter ce genre d\u2019initiative\uff53 et ainsi encourager cette nouvelle g\u00e9n\u00e9ration de cr\u00e9ateurs \u00e0 dynamiser le secteur gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 leurs id\u00e9es et leur \u00e9nergie. Ce sont eux, les prochains grands noms de l\u2019animation japonaise.\nTwitter : https://twitter.com/Thomasintokyo\n\"Cannon Busters\" Kickstarter Project : https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/473463284/cannon-busters-the-animated-series-pilot\nAs Okamoto grew up in the countryside, she was not able to watch as much anime as she wanted as a child. As a reaction to this, her passion towards anime became stronger than others. \nConnection to internet also introduced her to independent anime project created by Yasuhiro Yoshiura and Makoto Shinkai which gave a huge impact on her to the point to where her passion towards anime made her decide to create her own anime project during her student years.\nNormally, it takes many staffs to complete an anime project but that's not the case for her. She used to do that all by herself from her years as just a student so she is extraordinary talented with full of skills and also holds many years of field experiences as a production staff.\nJapan is filled with talented animation creators. However, it's also very difficult for young creators to create a full scale project even with a strong passion or even strong and talented skills. Okamoto was also one of them who wanted to perfect her project even more but her limit of budget limited her to do so. Her passion towards her project grows stronger day by day but this limitation puts her to a stop from completing her project. We thought that Kickstarter can actually create an anime production style that can break through the limit so that's why we decided to launch this project.  \nOkamoto's very first animation works \"11:08\".\nOne Episode, about 25 minutes\nJapanese Voice-Over / English Subtitle\n24p / 16:9\nDownload&Blu-ray = FullHD(1080p)\n*Animated GIF\n  These item images are of tentative design.

Design by Nicole Hogarty.\nWhat are EL materials?\nElectro-luminescient (EL) materials have been in use for over 60 years. They exist in many different forms (wire, paint, panels, tape), and have several advantages over other lighting technologies:\nThese properties make them well suited for integration into smart clothes, and other wearable electronics projects.  They are also great for illuminating complex geometries. \nThe Whoa Board's patent pending LumiSense technology for the first time makes it possible to turn any of them into a sensor.\nThis makes it easy to integrate interactive elements into designs that previously could have only been realized by complex and bulky systems.\nThe Whoa Board is a totally new design tool!\nIt makes it possible to translate ideas from VR into the headset-less world.  \nDress By Nicole Hogarty, Poi performance by Asmara Vega\nMore than that, it radically expands the design possibilities for smart clothes, and we are really excited to see what the community will produce!\nUse touch sensing to trigger LED's!\nAdditionally, as we explore new applications of this technology together, we would like to facilitate a conversation which leads us to discover ways to manufacture these new garments sustainably. To this end, we have partnered with the Tripty Project to source fabrics for our higher level rewards.\nThis article provides a good jumping off point thinking about the current ecological impact of the fashion industry.  \nStretch Goals\nCommunity\nPartners: Tripty Project - A sustainable fashion organization based out of Oakland, CA and Bangladesh that develops and manufactures beautiful textiles that are fairly produced and have low carbon footprints.\nFollow the Honey - A honey distributor that pushes farmers in the developing world to engage in farming practices that are friendlier to pollinators by creating a market for their honey. Organized under the auspices of #BlackHivesMatter.\nCurious Sound Objects - A community art show in Cambridge, MA that provided the creative prompt which kicked off this year long research project into Electro-Luminescient materials.\nTechnological Development through art, not war.\nColleagues: We would like to thank LumiLor and ILuminate, two other organizations who are actively engaged in exploring the potential of Electroluminecient materials for meeting with us and letting us use their footage.\nHacker-Spaces: This project owes a great debt to the presence of open community spaces which provided access to electronics test benches and expertise. Free of charge.\nIn particular, we would like to acknowledge Miters and Noisebridge.\nTeam: Atoms - Akivo Vekhter - 35 years ago in Moldova in the USSR, Akivo designed and built oscilloscopes from scratch in his free time because he couldn't get the devices he wanted in a store. Since then, he emigrated to the US, and has spent the past 25 years designing and manufacturing high precision sensors for NASA space suits, aircraft landing gears, and everything in between.\nBits - Josh Vekhter - For almost a decade, Josh has been exploring ways in which interactive visualizations can be used to expand our collective understanding of the world, in fields ranging from math to journalism, from 3d printing to (now) wearable technology.

We will be able to ship the first 1000 units quickly using existing stocks, but beyond that, there will be a several month lead time to obtain certain components. \n\nQuality Control: Good QC is a major focus of ours. We plan to hand test the the initial production run in order to arrive at a streamlined testing procedure which we will then implement at a factory for any additional runs that occur. \n\nWe are running this kickstarter to get the Whoa board out into the world and to rally a creative community interested in exploring a totally new frontier of wearable technology.

Quest of the Blob tells a story that is as wacky as it is adorable, through unconventional characters and imaginative levels \"-Jolie Menzel, Level Designer @ Ubisoft \n\"It's rare that you find a character this original, compelling and fun. I knew I needed to play BlubBlub the moment I saw it onscreen.\" -David Brevik, Game Industry veteran. Creator, Diablo.\n\n\"A challenging platformer with a great sense of humor and a provocative theme is something I can always get behind. I was especially struck by the eloquence and passion for the craft that these young developers demonstrated during their pitch presentation. Really looking forward to this one!\"\n-Anna Kipnis, Gameplay Programmer @ Double Fine Productions \nWatch Team BlubBlub's Presentation on Demo Day (including Q&A with judges!)\nPlay the prototype created at camp: BlubBlub Demo\nMost of the artwork you'll see on this page was created for the demo by the team (Adelle, lead artist) during their time at Girls Make Games 2016.\nThe team also composed some great tracks (led by Beatrix, currently in the Demo).

I'm 13 and into all sorts of games including Minecraft, Splatoon, Super Mario Galaxy, and Super Meat Boy. As you can see in our demo, I made over a hundred art assets for our game in order to make it awesome. Just so you know though, you're gonna die when playing through our game... :P\nBeatrix was born in Boston, Massachusetts. Her hobbies include reading, drawing,tasting gluten-free cuisine and narrating herself in third person. In Blub Blub: The Quest of the Blob, she worked mainly on the music but has a history of programming anything that moves. If she could be a game character, she would be Blobby, \"because I really like the way he walks!\u201d Her favorite video games are Minecraft, Splatoon and of course, the Quest of Blub Blub. Her favorite thing about making a game is that \u201cyou make tons of friends and get to play games 24/7, including testing your own!\u201d Beatrix started her programming adventures with Scratch and code.org.\nHi, I\u2019m Jordan Levine, and I am ten years old. If I were a blob, I would be just a random blue blob in the middle of nowhere, eating pizza and playing video games like Minecraft, Pokemon, Pokemon Go, and Legend of Zelda. I would also watch videos and pet my cats. My favorite part of making BlubBlub was making the concept art, because it was fun! \nManaira \u201cMeme\u201d is a Boston-native game enthusiast, choreographing whiz kid, and a prodigy programmer. Her favorite subjects are Math & Science - and of course, recess. Meme\u2019s favorite games to play are Slither, Banana Kong, and World Chef. Being a song-writer, dancer, game creator and \u201cself-acclaimed\u201d food critic, blends her computing and classical talents and gives her unique perspective. She programmed the crux of the project and worked as a producer along side her teammates. Her favorite part of \"Girls Make Games\" Camp was working closely with her teammates and counselor and of course testing their creation - BlubBlub: Quest of the Blob! \n  $5 BLUB BACKER!\nA big thank you for believing in the Blubs!

With the help of a growing list of partners like Xbox, Intel, the MIT Game Lab and so many others, we're determined to address the gender gap in the games industry, one camp at a time. \nEmily's story is not unique. From being stereotyped to being ignored, it's hard work trying to combat the hostility that women - especially young women - face in video game communities these days.\nOne of the reasons we started Girls Make Games was to give burgeoning young developers in the face of these sometimes discouraging experiences the confidence and experience they'll need to pursue careers in video games or technology.\nThe more support we can get for programs like Girls Make Games, the more confident young women will feel about becoming developers - knowing that others like them are getting the recognition, encouragement, and support they need.\nA special Thank You to all our industry partners and sponsors!\nLet's be Friends!\nThe girls and team would be very thankful if you could help spread the news about this game development project on Twitter, Tumblr, Facebook, Instagram, or whichever social media network you prefer.\n\nPlease feel free to leave a comment on this Kickstarter, or follow us on Facebook or Twitter!!! We would love your feedback.\nNext Year and BEYOND\nWe're so excited to share that as of this August, 929 girls that have gone through Girls Make Games summer camps + workshops around the world! \n\nSome interesting stats:\n#Cities: 38 US + international\n#Events (camps/workshops): 61\nNew international cities this year (2016):\nLahore, Pakistan,\nSao Palo, Brazil\nBerlin, Germany\nLondon, UK\nAl Ain, UAE \nMontreal, Canada\nFor the first time ever, we're also launching an online curriculum this December that will be available for download at no cost.

That means terrain that affects your movement, cover that can hinder the best laid plans, and skills that are never wasted.\nFor our base funding goal, we have a 10 hour experience planned, and our dream game (essentially double that funding goal) will double that content with expanded story missions, side quests, customization options, and more classes/skills.\nInvestment matters, and in a tactical RPG your biggest investment is your character class. So we want them to be purposeful, which is why classes in Arcadian Atlas have several core builds that your characters develop over the course of the game. That means no class hopping, but instead class evolution.\nCustomize your character at the start with their preferred class build, and when the time comes you can specialize that build through branching evolved classes with entire skill trees all their own.\nRanger - the master of area control, a Ranger\u2019s knowledge of deadly plants and skill with a bow means wielding the environment to cripple and crush the enemy.\nApothecary - a chemist of extraordinary skill, the Apothecary\u2019s potent brews and experimental arts can heal or wreck devastating damage on the battlefield.\nRogue - sneaky, sneaky; stabby, stabby. The Rogue isn\u2019t interested in manners - why bother when slashing an achilles heel or a surprise attack does the job faster?\nWarmancer - adept at brute force and powerful magics, the warmancer specializes in harnessing latent energies for devastating area of affect spells.\nAnd that's just the beginning! Outside those and other core classes, we also have two Advanced Classes for each Base class! At a certain job level, you'll open up two advanced classes to choose from that further specialize your troops!\nStart by molding each of your characters with your preferred stats to make that rogue a tiny bit stronger so backstab damage finishes foes off in one swoop, or quicker to get in and out of a conflict in a pinch.\nAnd skills, our favorite part of any tactical RPG. Nothing wasted, everything with a purpose: that's our skill philosophy, so our skill system consists of branching specializations for each class.\nStart out with your choice of weapon mastery skills which dictate how you want that class to play. Want your Ranger to master the wider range and faster movement skills of a bow, or the sheer power and crippling attacks from a crossbow? Choose based on your style and watch as new branches open with more powerful and unique abilities to compliment that style.\nArcadia is a sprawling continent divided by immense mountains, with landscapes as varied as the inhabitants. We\u2019re looking forward to bringing those ecosystems into the battle system by creating a breathtaking pixel world that is as treacherous as it is gorgeous.\nThick snowfall, dense forests, rushing rivers, tiered cities - every map affects the way you approach a fight and alters your strategy. Make use of trees to protect yourself from that line of rangers ahead, or place your apothecary opposite an enemy knight with rushing rapids between them while you wear away his armor with acid bottles.\nSomething different - that\u2019s what we set out to capture with our soundtrack. Jazzy saxophone, toe-tapping grooves in the weapon shop, and funky trip-hop beats as you march to battle in a seaside village - we wanted the audio to be infinitely listenable, both in-game and out.\nWith its recurring musical themes and motifs giving a nod to RPG composers\u2019 greats, Arcadian Atlas\u2019 melody-driven soundtrack will merge a sound bed of symphonic jazz with elements of trip-hop, soul and funk. A wide range of live-recorded instrumentalists recorded through vintage microphones and equipment will set the right mood for each scene, providing an earthy, hand-made and clearly unique tone throughout the game.\nOur composer, Moritz P.G. Katz of German Wahnsinn Studio, has the perfect love of inventive musical stylings to bring the world of Arcadia to life in a unique way. Listen to just a few of his custom tracks below:\nStar-Crossed Lovers\nShop Theme:\nWhere Are We Now:\nTeaser Video Theme:\nEstablished in 2015, Twin Otter Studios is an independent game studio helmed by Becca and Taylor Bair, a brother and sister duo based in Texas. We grew up entrenched in the golden age of SNES and Playstation masterpieces, eventually carving our own game development path by crafting the 15+ hour RPG title Genesis.\nArcadian Atlas is a passion project birthed from a love of pixel masterpieces in the 90\u2019s and a longing to make a fresh tactical RPG with roots firmly planted in the genre\u2019s classics. Our team\u2019s experience spans games like Vidar, Fort Meow, Lugdunon, Dreamblazers, Solar Crusaders, and Genesis, with over 18 years in the industry, so we know how to manage talent, finances, and time to create wonderful game experiences.\nWe\u2019ve got phenomenal talent behind us, and we\u2019re serious about crafting an experience that will go down as a true classic of the tactical RPG genre. Whether it be melodies that quicken the pulse, pixel art that leaves you breathless, gameplay that challenges even the most hardened tactics veterans, or characters that you fall in love with, Arcadian Atlas is a platform where our passion and talent have no ceiling. That excites us, and we\u2019re glad our Kickstarter backers get to be an integral part.\nCommunity is essential. We\u2019ve learned that projects sink or swim based on the people supporting them, and Kickstarter was the best avenue we could think of to allow the community to bring this project to life. It\u2019s a dream we\u2019ve had for years to see the golden era of pixel art meet another great tactical RPG in the vein of Tactics Ogre, Fire Emblem, Vandal Hearts and the FFT series.\nAnd financially, it makes sense. Game development is expensive; we can\u2019t pretend it isn\u2019t. It\u2019s expensive on time just as much as it is on the wallet, and Kickstarter funds give us the chance to speed production and make Arcadian Atlas the game we\u2019ve dreamed it could be. Without finances, that simply isn\u2019t possible.\nWe\u2019re glad to be dependent on you. It keeps us accountable, and that\u2019s necessary. We want feedback, and Kickstarter is the perfect forum for it, both financial and verbal.\nFunding Allotment", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAll game developers face challenges and unforeseen obstacles, and Twin Otter Studios is no different. Development revolves around the key resources of money and time, and the main risks of this and any game project involve anticipating timelines and resource management.\n\nWe see the greatest obstacle as crafting a well balanced game that walks the line between challenging veterans and allowing multiple paths of improvement for newer players to the tactical RPG genre. That's why we will incorporate various stages of quality assurance and balance testing throughout the project ramping up to the final release.\n\nIf programming obstacles or unforeseen events arise, this could always push the release date of the game beyond the February 1st, 2018 goal, though we have years of experience in the field and have ensured there is flex in both our schedules and budget to accommodate those events. Regardless of the outcome of this Kickstarter, we will produce this game, but the resources from this Kickstarter will speed and improve that process, and we're excited about that prospect.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #34", "update_userinfo": "A Real Doozy of an Update", "update_content": "Hello hello, all~!\n\nWhat's Shakin'?\nIt's been an absolutely INSANE sprint of keeping our faces to our monitors, knocking out milestone after milestone with the publisher.

From its riveting fantasy storyline, gorgeous visuals, a stirring score, romance, and of course, awesome gigantic robots, it's clear that this is a series that has stood the test of time.\nThe series is beloved worldwide, but there has never been a complete English dub for fans. The uncut HD Japanese version of the show includes scenes that have never been seen in North America, meaning that English speakers have never experienced the show fully in dubbed format. Also, despite the fantastic visuals, the series has not been released in its HD glory on Blu-ray here either. Across forums, social media, conventions, and more, fans like you have voiced endless requests for a new full-series dub that gives this series the treatment it deserves. Team up with us to make this a reality!\nWe\u2019ve been working hand-in-hand with Sunrise\u2014and legendary director Kazuki Akane and creator Shoji Kawamori\u2014to explore the possibility of creating this new dub for months. We aren\u2019t attempting to raise the entire production costs of a new dub, but rather to demonstrate the extent of fan interest\u2014is it enough to warrant the creation of this dub? If the demand is truly there, then you can think of this Kickstarter more as a pre-order campaign rather than a fundraiser.\nIf the project meets the goal of $150,000, we\u2019ll be releasing The Vision of Escaflowne television series on Blu-ray and DVD with both the original uncut Japanese HD with English subtitles, and a brand-new English dub matching those materials. This release will also include an exclusive interview with Kazuki Akane and Shoji Kawamori specifically recorded for English-speaking fans, and the Escaflowne movie will receive a new matching dub.

A few years ago, I successfully Kickstarted a run of acrylic charms which you can check out here.  After blowing past my intial goals on that kickstarter I put a lot of thought into what my next project will be.  Now that a few years have passed I've decided to take the next step and turn some of the fan favorites into plush toys!  \nI've been attending conventions selling my artwork for years and would love to add Plushies to my stock.

They are definitely made for people, not for real life puppies! \nA detailed view of Corgi!\nPugasus are made of 100% magic and rainbows\n And Otter!\nSo what's the Plan?\nI have spent over a year working with Shinedown Productions to perfect plush prototypes to my exacting standards.  They will go into production as soon as we are funded!\nRewards!\nIn addition to the Plushies, there are some other great goodies available!  The table below is a visual breakdown of which items are included with each reward tier.  Rewards include a very majestic postcard inspired by a poster from my childhood, a Chubby Corgi sticker, a Pugasus and Corgi lanyard, grocery totes and coloring books!\nAll items are works-in-progress and may change slightly in their final form. We also may be adding more fun items if the campaign goes well, so keep an eye out!\nAll the possible swag\nCustom Designed Charms available with Custom Charm Tier\nA corgi signifies one plush - not just corgi.\n All of the \"stuff\" will be available as individual add ons. Add ons will only be available for tiers that already had physical rewards, if you are pledging for the lowest tier you will not be able to purchase add ons. The prices for \"the stuff\" take into account increased shipping costs as well.\nTo add an extra item add the amount from this chart to your pledge when you back! If you have already baked you can change your pledge to be higher, to do that click on the \"manage your pledge\" button near the top of the Corgi and Pugasus project page. On the next screen click \"change your pledge\" and then adjust your pledge as needed. For example, if you pledged then $35 corgi tier and wanted to add the coloring book you would change your pledge to be $47.\nThere are two main stretch goals to send two additional plushies into production.  In addition to these goals I'll also be revealing smaller surprises along the way!\n$20,000 - Fox Plush!\nIf we reach the stretch goal of $20,000 we will unlock the Fox Plush! Specific reward tiers for the Fox will be added and anyone pledging at a tier with more than one plush will have the option to choose this cutie.\nTube fox!\nMoney breakdown\nThe funding breakdown is pretty simple.

Predictable grid-based movement ensures that you know where you are, but other players don\u2019t. Vigilance is key as environmental tells such as footprints and other disturbances will point out careless cadets. Using special abilities and firing your Invisigun will also momentarily give you away. Along with items and powerups, these mechanics reward stealth, trickery, reflex, forethought, deception, bluffing, and awareness. A variety of lovingly-made environments, maps, game modes, and abilities combine for high replayability and a deep path to mastery.\nBecause everyone\u2019s invisible, the environments are highly interactive - so you\u2019ll want to keep your eyes and ears peeled for clues as to where other players are moving about. For example, you can see proximity doors opening and closing, or leaves falling from bumped trees, or footsteps splashing through puddles and leaving tracks in the snow.\nKey features:\nCompete with up to 4 friends or bots on a single screen\nMix and match local and online players\nControl your hero using gamepads or the keyboard\nEnjoy hand-crafted pixel art made with care\nBattle your friends using a variety of heroes, each with unique special abilities\nExplore 50 maps spread across 5 planets, each with unique interactivity, hazards, and weather effects\nChoose from a variety of game modes playable on every map for deep replayability\nCustomize the game mode conditions with match modifiers\nView hilariously revealing instant replays that expose tactics\nShare instant replays as animated GIFs\nGroove to the custom pulsing, ambient soundtrack composed by Paper Sound\nGame modes:\nPlanned targets:\nFor the last year and a half I\u2019ve been funding development on my own, and I\u2019m here to ask the community for support in finishing the game!\n10 minutes of pre-alpha gameplay:\nHere's a bunch of rounds between two players across three planets, showing some typical stealth behavior, prediction, trickery, and replays. Please watch at 60 fps. :)\nInvisigun is inspired by the revival of the couch-multiplayer genre, classic party games like Super Bomberman, and Nintendo's focus on cute and fun sensibilities. Most modern multiplayer games are super fast-paced and reflex-based. However, Invisigun\u2019s design is actually more grounded in slower, calculated, stealth-based gameplay.\nMy goal was to develop a game that is fun for casual and party play, but deep enough to reward practice for highly-competitive players as well.\nThe most satisfying competitive games have lots of variety and depth so players can really spend time developing their own tactics. I\u2019ve always loved when you have simple gameplay mechanics that play off each other in unpredictable ways to form emergent complexity.\nA handful of implemented powerups\nIn Invisigun, trying to shoot your opponents, or using a special ability, or even just navigating obstacles are all really simple things that most games share. But since everyone\u2019s invisible, the typical chaos of a battle arena is often interrupted by a sort-of-tense calm, where although it may look like there\u2019s nothing happening onscreen, there\u2019s actually a fairly intense mental chess match unfolding. \nEvery hero has a unique special ability, and there are multiple game modes playable across tons of different maps - so every battle feels different. Being invisible obviously presents a unique twist on some classic game modes - such as king of the hill, where you can see that the area is being controlled but you don\u2019t quite know exactly where they are within it!\nAchievements for the completionists\nI wanted Invisigun Heroes to capture some of the feel of those classic carnival western shooting galleries or your first time at a pinball machine, in the sense that it\u2019s fun to discover what happens when you interact with different set-pieces. The pre-alpha currently has three fully-developed worlds.\nMore planets will be created for release\nNemoris: a forest planet with trees that shed leaves when bumped and shallow water that shows footstep splashes\nArx-515: an industrial planet with shot-blocking proximity doors that automatically open and close, conveyor belts that silently move players around, and security cameras that will orient to nearby players\nGlaciarii: a frozen planet with snow banks revealing footsteps that fade over time, and a cave-yeti that can freeze players in its icy breath\nSome of the interactive environmental props\nThe aim is to add more unique interactive elements to the existing three planets and have two more for release: fire and temple-themed. With a minimum of 10 maps per planet, that\u2019s at least 50 maps at launch, with each supporting every game mode for a huge number of possible combinations and ways to play.\nVarious environmental and weather effects\nThis video shows a quick demonstration of each of the current hero abilities. You can help design new heroes to be included in the release version of the game!\nPLAY\n\nThe game's already stable and solid for local-multiplayer, and works great with keyboards and game controllers. However, a large focus of this Kickstarter is to make sure that online play is fully supported and done right - including public and private match listings. The fundamental mechanics behind Invisigun make for an ideal real-time networked game since it\u2019s based on grid-movement and slower gameplay rather than millisecond-based twitch reflexes.\nI\u2019ve already had some success with early network prototyping, but decided to use Unity\u2019s newer and more robust networking API going forward. This is a crucial part of the puzzle for Invisigun Heroes to have a healthy competitive community that can grow after launch.\nOnline UI prototype\nI\u2019ve been working professionally as a programmer, UI designer, sound designer, and music composer for the past 15 years on both web and game projects. I\u2019ve developed and shipped several mobile games and apps, and most recently worked as lead UI and Sound designer at Adhesive Games on the mech shooter Hawken, currently published on Steam.\nI\u2019ve always been drawn to creative things like music and illustration, as well as technical things like programming and engineering. For me, video games have always been both a source and a destination. The more I learn, the more I want to contribute in some meaningful way. Since I\u2019ve always worn many technical and creative hats, dedicating myself to creating my own games has been a great way to combine everything I\u2019ve learned and everything I love.\nI started Sombr Studio a year and a half ago, and have collaborated with some amazingly-talented people on Invisigun Heroes. My music partner Ali Bavarian cowrote the soundtrack for Hawken with me, and the soundtrack for Invisigun is already well underway. I was also lucky enough to have Yujin Choo create some amazing character art that really brings the heroes to life (and inspired some of the special abilities). I had a lot of help from Danny Savage and James Enochs on the campaign video production, and the lovable puppet was hand-made by Kevin Chan.\nInvisigun's original soundtrack is being produced by Paper Sound (composer Ali Bavarian and myself), and consists of a unique track for each planet. They are meant to serve as a \"musical bed\" for the rest of the game's audio to sit upon. Since sound is important for figuring out where players are, the OST has a more subdued, ambient, yet pulsing feel. You can listen to samples of the tracks in the playlist below, and the full soundtrack is available as a digital download for some of the reward tiers!\nWith the awesome character art by Yujin, I'm proud to be able to offer these exclusive 11\" x 17\" art prints, produced and fulfilled by Gallery Nucleus - a gallery in Alhambra, CA, specializing in original contemporary, illustrated, graphic, commercial, and narrative art, and host to some of the best exhibitions around! I have a really close relationship with Nucleus, and there's no one around better equipped to handle the prints production. Some of the tiers include prints that will be signed by the Sombr Studio team.\nWho doesn't love a fun button? A random hero pin will be included in every backer tier that includes a shipment of any kind!\nVictory Taunt: After each match or round, the victor shows up on-screen and delivers a little light-hearted insult to the losers. As a backer, you can submit one of these phrases to be included in the final game (within reason). Please note that these aren't chosen by the player, but randomly displayed from the database of all contributed insults. Here's an example:\nSometimes, the victor can be pretty heartless\nCartographer: I'll work with you to design a custom map that will be included as one of the official Invisigun Heroes maps on release. My plan at the moment is to have a special Kickstarter planet to include these maps, with a clear author credit when selecting the map. I'm happy to iterate with you until the map meets what you had in mind.\nHero: I'll work with you to design a custom hero and special ability. This has a major effect on all aspects of the game, so we'll collaborate with great care to include a new unique character that is balanced and fun. And of course, you get to name them (within reason)!\nSurprises in store:\nThere are some really cool surprises planned if the funding reaches certain milestones. These will be deciphered one by one if the goals are met.\nThanks so much for taking the time to read this! I\u2019d love for you to join me on this project, and there are some really fun rewards for each of the backer tiers.\nJust a couple of puppets", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhat I really hope to convey is that I\u2019ve taken this as far as I can with my own resources. Game campaigns can be overrun with unexpected costs, feature-creep, or over-promising and going beyond a reasonable scope. I wanted to run a Kickstarter that's low-risk for backers, without promises that are too difficult to deliver. Invisigun has been greenlit on Steam, and this'll make it much easier to distribute updates to backers during development. All the gameplay footage here is real, and the majority of the dev work has been focused on producing a stable code foundation and in-house tools to make sure the final stretch goes smoothly. This fundraiser is for asset production, dev time, fees, contract work, community building, and most importantly, really solid online-play support!\n\nPorting the game to consoles is also a risk in itself, since it can present some unforeseen technical challenges. Since the game is built in Unity, it already has a head start and many of the inherent risks are already mitigated. Also, the low-res art style is not CPU- or GPU- intensive, so quality reduction won't be necessary. I've also been accepted to the ID@Xbox and Sony Partner developer programs, so I have some contacts in both to get the ball rolling when appropriate, and I'm confident that publishing on Wii U will follow a similar process.\n\nThank you!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #28", "update_userinfo": "Invisigun Reloaded, Nintendo Switch, August 22nd", "update_content": "Kickstarter Journey complete!\nThank you all for supporting Invisigun on this lengthy journey.

If you live in Canada or most of Europe you can add a 2nd or 3rd game for just $16 + $2 more per copy since you are in Zone 2.\nIf you read nothing else or don't want to watch Eric Martin's 4-minute how-to video, then please read this 60-Second Overview of Game Play:\nPlayers collectively face a monster with a certain value.  \nEach player places a card from their hand face down.\nAll cards are revealed and any duplicate cards are removed (yes like Get Bit so far!).  The sum of all cards must be equal or greater than the value of the monster or the players are defeated.  \nIf the players are defeated then the player who contributed the lowest value card loses all gems of one color.  \nSimple right?  Here is the snag, if players defeat the monster then the player who played the lowest card gets rewarded first/best! \nYou have to be the lowest card played to get a lot of points, but you also run the greatest risk. \n$16.  That is it.  That is all you need to back to get this game.  Come on!  This is a no-brainer.\nLimited Edition Backers will get a hand-numbered sticker included with their game, only 500 of each level available and we expect these to go quickly!\nEarly Delivery to your door!  Backers will get this game several weeks in advance of the release date, or even earlier!\nHuge Savings!  We expect the game to retail for $20-$25, you're getting the game at a significant savings off of the retail price!\nFree upgrades through Stretch Rewards!  Backers can get free bonus items and upgrades to the game as the project progresses. Help us make the game better by supporting us here!\nAccess to extremely discounted add-ons.  Add-ons at a fraction of their retail price.  Note:  These add-ons will be available later but will cost more and may be extremely limited.\nCheap Shipping!  We are subsidizing the shipping for all of you so shipping is extremely affordable or even FREE depending on where you live.\nMayday has become known for our light filler, family friendly games with hits such as Click Clack Lumberjack, Coconuts, Get Bit, Walk the Plank and Garbage Day.  Well this game fits right in our catalog as a fast-playing \"filler\" game with surprising depth and an uber-small price tag.  We are so happy to be bringing the game to you!\nChose your class and get bustin' that dungeon!\nFirst things first, this game is licensed to us from Korea, where it is already a hit.  The game's rulebook and introduction wording is being left exactly as it is because it adds to the cute, quirky nature of the game.  Yes the translation is a bit tongue in cheek, but we like it that way.  \nFight monsters, grab gems, and fear your comrades! \nIn Dungeon Busters, the players take the role of heroes exploring dungeons and defeating monsters in search of treasures. In order to defeat a monster, every player simultaneously plays a card face-down then all reveal. If two or more players play the same value, they are all ignored. If players are defeated, the player who played the lowest value should return some treasures as a penalty. If players defeat the monster, players divide rewards but the player who played the lowest card gets the best reward!\nThe full rules are HERE.  Eric Martin of BGG News does a GREAT JOB of explaining the entire game in just under 5 minutes.  Yes it is that easy to grasp, but very hard to win/master.\n The secret is in the payout for the cards, in order to get rewarded you have to play a lower card, but if you play the lowest card and the group loses, then you loose all the gems of one color, OUCH!\n\"We had so much fun at Essen 2015 playing this game. There was so much interaction and table talk, we laugh so hard XD\" -Gonzalo Aguirre Bisi (Xoul on BoardGameGeek HERE, Rome Italy)\n\"This one can be best described as Cutthroat Caverns in 20min. One I would like to play more of as a quick filler.\"  -Jason Obermeyer (Bond8089 on BoardGameGeek HERE,  Irvine, California)\n\"Dungeon Busters really surprised me.  Dungeon Busters is going to be added to my collection because it is a FANTASTIC LIGHT FILLER GAME!  I love this game and I will routinely grab this game now.  It plays good with three, it plays great with four and I love it with five [players].  The components are nice, the cards are nice... I could tell that the artwork is very well done, it is compact and portable, which is something that always appeals to me.  It hits the \"family game\" market perfectly, it also hits the \"filler game\" market perfectly, so it is something I can play on game night, or it is something I can play with younger kids, or my family.\" -Bower's Game Corner, see full video HERE.\n                                                      While we normally like to offer nice stretch goals, those come at a cost. We are keeping things very simple here with just a few stretch rewards IF this does really well!\nWow, 100% Funded on Day 1!\n                                                    We are giving you full and complete disclosure of shipping. We are covering most of the shipping costs, and are excited to offer these amazing shipping costs: FREE, $1 or $2 shipping! WOW! \nZone 1 Free Shipping: USA, China (PRC), Hong Kong, South Korea & Japan \nZone 2 $2 Shipping: The EU, Canada, Mongolia, Thailand, and SPECIAL: $2 shipping to Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia due to our extremely low shipping rates! \nZone 3 $3 Shipping: The Rest Of The World \nHow are we able to do this? \nWell first of all, the game is light weight and durable so the game will fit easily into a bubble mailer. We are also shipping ALL THE REWARDS outside of the USA directly from our fulfillment house in China to you! That means the rewards will get shipped quickly and efficiently. \nWhat about \"EU Friendly\" or \"Canadian Friendly\"? Will I be getting hit with a big customs/VAT/Duty Bill? \n We can't guarantee you won't be hit with a bill, but we can assure you that the actual value of the rewards being shipped to you is low, lower than the $10 USD VAT/CUSTOMS threshold for even the strictest countries. We are covering $4.54 of shipping for EVERY BACKER already, so the true value of the game is going to be less than $15. That is because we will state the value of the reward at our replacement cost. We aren't sure what the retail price will be yet, so we can't even put that on the shipment, though we are leaning toward a price of $20-255 USD for the game. \nWe can say that we shipped Viceroy directly to several backers in the EU and to all our backers in Canada via this same method and none of them got hit with duties/customs, and that game was worth a lot more. We won't guarantee you won't be hit with some fees/duties, but we are 98% sure you won't. \nWill my shipment be traceable? I want a tracking number when it ships!\n No, your shipment will not be traceable, it will show up as a first class package through your post office and those do NOT have tracking numbers. We can say that your reward will arrive in 7-20 business days after it ships. We can send you a screen shot of the shipping notice and confirm that it went out if it doesn't show up, but there is no tracking number.  That is how we are able to offer such low shipping rates.\nBut I want a tracking number! \nOk, OK! You want a tracking number, fine! :) If you want a tracking number then you can pay a little extra on your shipping service to get a tracking number. Here are the rates: \nTracking Number Add On:\nZone 1 (See countries above): +$1 more \nZone 2: +$1 more \nZone 3: +$2 more \nWait a minute, did you say a BUBBLE MAILER? Not so fast, I want a box! Don't you dare ship my rewards in a bubble mailer! \nHey, we are quoting very cheap shipping here because of the weight, and this specific game comes in a nice sturdy box. It is tough and we expect it will be able to handle the rough ride through the mail. Shipping the game in a box will add about 150 grams and another $0.30-0.60 in packaging to the cost of your shipment. Sure we can do that, but it will cost you. If you want your reward to ship in a box rather than a bubble mailer, here are the rates: \nShipping Box Add On: \nZone 1 (See countries above): +$2 more \nZone 2: +$3 more \nZone 3: +$4 more  \nWhat if I want my rewards shipped in a box AND to include a tracking number?\nNo problem, just add both the costs for the shipping box and the tracking number. The totals to add on would be Zone 1: $3,  Zone 2: $4 and  Zone 3: $6.\n Why Kickstarter?\nSo let's face it, we have had a lot of previous KS projects and all of the games have been successful. You'd think by now that we would be \"set\" and not need to do Kickstarters any more, right? Well, not so much. While Mayday has been successful, we are still a very small company, just 5 employees! All of our cash is tied up in other projects. In fact if you look at our history we introduced just 3 new games in 2010 and 2011 before Kickstarter. Since KS we have had nearly 20 new games, but that is ALL thanks to backers like you. By doing the KS program we are able to gauge interest and get the game made in much larger quantities and with cheaper prices to our customers. This is a large part of why we can offer our last few KS projects at such a low price point. With this much stuff in the game and such a small company, this would only be possible with the support of the KS community.\nCheck our twitter for lots of contests and free prizes!\n                                            ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis project doesn't have any risks to speak of if we meet our goal.

Our goal is to provide huge, sprawling environments for the player to explore using dynamic parkour to navigate the remains of a mysterious civilization. The game plays like the better parts of Mirror\u2019s Edge, with some pivotal refinements on the movement systems. Narratively, the player will be immersed in a world built by the relationship between Isra (Ashly Burch) and the Robot (Dante Basco). \nIntuitive Parkour System - All you need to remember is one button to perform a complex sequence of parkour moves such as wall-running, wall-jumping, sliding, and vaulting. \nGrappling Hook - Swing and sling yourself to incredible heights and distances by mastering the versatile, physics based grappling hook system. \nPLAY\n\nThe new grapple-bow in action!\nin-game prototype footage\nMultiple Perspectives: The game can be played in either a 1st-person or 3rd person view\nExpansive  Levels - Find unique, creative ways to reach your goals by taking advantage of the intricate architecture in the world. \nRobot Companion - The Robot will follow you through your journey, granting you access to the ancient technology that permeates this forgotten world\u2026 if you ask nicely. \nSecrets - Explore all the nooks and crannies to discover the hidden areas that are only accessible by performing challenging maneuvers.\nIn a small, remote village, on a wasteland of a planet, lives a young girl named Isra. Raised to one day lead her people, she longs instead to follow her uncle\u2019s path and explore the world beyond the safety of their village. As another cycle ends, she convinces him to bring her along on his journey. He has agreed to take Isra to the place where he must travel every cycle in order for their people to survive: The Forgotten.\nThe game is in an alpha state, and we\u2019ve been publicly showcasing builds of the project at conferences and festivals. We intend for the game to be released first on PC, Mac, and Linux with intentions to release on PS4 + Xbox One pending console arrangements.\nOur entire creative and production team is accounted for and working around the clock to make Failsafe the game it's meant to be.\nWe\u2019re projecting that the project will reach its completion stage summer of 2016.\nA bulk of our development time has gone toward creating the complex first person parkour mechanics of the game, and creating animations via inverse kinematics to make the visual cues of each movement as articulate as possible to emphasize the player\u2019s movements and mitigate disorientation through fast paced, first person movements.\nThe big task ahead is finishing the levels that will comprise of Failsafe\u2019s main campaign. The $80,000 goal will provide the team with the final resources it needs to complete the game on our schedule.\nWe here at Game Over want to remain an independent studio so that we can create new and challenging games that do not adhere to mechanical norms and what publishers consider \u201csafe\u201d projects.

The first attempts to explore inside it ended in disaster.\nGuide the remaining survivors through the sprawling passageways of the Nullpoint. Explore, scavenge, and survive long enough, and you may uncover the story of the ill-fated expeditions, and the dark secrets of the Nullpoint itself. \nFor anyone to escape the Nullpoint, sacrifices will have to be made. New survivors can always be found to replace the fallen. But beware: there are no reloads, and backup isn\u2019t coming. If your survivors all die, you\u2019ll have to start again from the beginning.\nQuick Overview\nPlatforms: PC / MAC\nReal-Time Tactics - Control up to 5 survivors with a scheme familiar to any RTS player.\nSurvival Horror Elements - Scavenge for limited supplies, but keep a lookout for things that lurk in the darkness. Gauge carefully whether to fight, run, or hide based off of your team's resources.\nShip-based & On-foot Exploration - Guide your ship between docks in the Nullpoint, then disembark and take your survivors on loot runs.\nShip Upgrade Meta - Use scavenged resources to upgrade & repair your ship's internal systems.\nRoguelike Gameplay Loop - Getting through the Nullpoint will be difficult, and the stakes are high. If all survivors in the party die, the game will reset and the dungeons will re-randomize.\nProcedural, Real-time Tactics Dungeon Crawling:\nCommand up to 5 survivors using RTS-style controls through the vast, procedurally-generated levels of the Nullpoint. No two runs will be the same unless you choose to share your world seed with a friend.\nScavenge for Resources:\nResources are scarce. Your band of survivors will rely on scavenging what supplies remain from the ruined expedition outposts scattered throughout the Nullpoint.\nExploring beyond the base camps could yield even better rewards, if you\u2019re willing to risk venturing into the deepest, darkest parts of the facility.\nUpgrade Your Ship:\nYour survivors have only one shelter - a transport shuttle left behind by one of the prior expeditions. This will be your teams\u2019 only refuge from the Nullpoint\u2019s punishing, hostile environment. Treat it with care. You only get one.\nOn board the ship, you\u2019ll navigate through the Nullpoint, re-equip, and heal your crew. However, the benefits your ship offers are limited based on where you invest resources.  \nDo you repair the healing systems or the item dispenser? Do you rig together a station to upgrade your weapons instead? Or, do you play it safe, and repair the ship\u2019s fraying outer hull?\n\n\nMourn The Dead, Protect the Living:\nThe Nullpoint is a cold, brutal place. Survivors will die, but as long as at least one stays alive, the story continues.\nThat sole survivor might go on to rebuild the team and keep the hope of escaping the Nullpoint alive.\nIt all began by chance. A deep space probe on its way out of the solar system reported a strange, blank spot in the background radiation scans. Follow-up scans confirmed the deadzone, but nothing could penetrate or identify it.\n\nWe didn\u2019t know what, but something was unmistakably out there, floating quietly in loose orbit just past Saturn.\nThe next probe was sent, equipped and prepared to photograph the dark spot, and the results were explosive. The Nullpoint, as the media called it, wasn\u2019t an asteroid or a gas cloud. It was a structure. Whatever it was, it was massive, capable of absorbing every wavelength outside the visible spectrum, and not built by human hands.\n\nThe prospect of alien technology prompted several governments and corporations to assemble fleets and make the year-long journey out to the Nullpoint, to lay claim to a piece of this new milestone in human history.\n\nThey ventured into the Nullpoint prepared for anything - diplomacy, research, war.\n\nThe truth of what they found remains buried in the Nullpoint with them.\n\n\nExplore at Your Own Pace:\nThe Superstructure is massive. Finding the shuttle doesn't mean finding a way out.\nThe Nullpoint\u2019s interior is broken up into two biomes: Superstructure and Substrates. The Superstructure is comprised of cavernous interior passageways big enough that humanity\u2019s capital ships were able to easily fly inside them.\nDotting the Superstructure are numerous access points to the Substrates: a maze of corridors and passageways that can only be explored on foot.\nAbandoned camps in the Substrates are a great place to scavenge.\nYou will guide your survivors and their ship through the Superstructure in search of docking points where your survivors can then disembark to search for supplies.\nSecure the dock when you first disembark... or risk being cut off from the ship on the way back.\nSome Substrates contain valuable forward base camps that can be looted, while others will contain the alien control consoles needed to unlock the next Superstructure layer and advance the game. It\u2019s up to you to which of these Substrates you\u2019d like to risk exploring, and how deep you venture into them before turning back to the ship.\nFight, Outsmart, or Sneak Past the Horrors of the Nullpoint:\nResources are scarce, and even the most basic monsters can be deadly. You will have to develop strategies for carefully managing your limited supplies. Your team's lives depend on conserving ammunition, and rationing your first aid kits.\nStrategic Monster Design:\nEvery being in the Nullpoint has a story, and a unique set of abilities and behaviors. Some monsters are deaf and blind. Others can hear a gunshot from a mile away. Some won\u2019t attack you at all\u2026until, for some reason, they do. Some monsters will even fight each other, given the opportunity.\nIt\u2019s up to you to study their behavior, and discover how to best avoid, fight or exploit them.\nCurrently we're targeting a PC and MAC release. \nWe're planning to release on Steam, but definitely want to provide a DRM-free option as well.\nWe are a group of veteran game developers working at Schell Games in Pittsburgh, PA. \nNullpoint is a project we\u2019ve been working on in our spare time for nearly a year. We\u2019re ready to share what we\u2019ve been working on with the world, and ultimately Kickstart a fully-realized version.\nThe Nullpoint team is bolstered by the circle of support here at Schell Games, including developers like Marc Tattersall (Diablo II), Michael Giam (Twisted Metal), Tim Sweeney (City of Heroes), Harley Baldwin White-Wiedow (Tomb Raider: Underworld), Matt Mahon (Dungeon Siege II), and Jesse Schell (Art of Game Design).\nAs a team, we\u2019ve been heavily influenced by games like Darkest Dungeon, Faster Than Light, The Binding of Isaac, and Dark Souls. We love hard games \u2013 games that force you to evaluate your choices carefully, and give your choices meaning by raising the stakes on what you stand to lose.\nSchell Games has agreed to cover two thirds of our development costs. That\u2019s enough for us to cover basic functionality like saving and loading, survivor persistence, AI, menus, and all the other things few people initially think about when imagining game development. After further discussion, we determined we\u2019d need more than that to really make a game worth playing.\nAll of the funds from Kickstarter (apart from Kickstarter\u2019s 8% cut, and the costs of our rewards) will go directly toward adding features and content to the game.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\n- The Risk of Making Something Weird.\nThere\u2019s always risk involved when building something completely new and different. Part of why we so badly want to make this game is because we\u2019ve never played something quite like it before. It\u2019s sitting in between a few genres, but doesn\u2019t quite follow any existing game formula.\n\nBecause of our game\u2019s uniqueness, we have already faced and will continue to face unique technical and design challenges. Things that sound fun at first might turn out to be annoying or repetitive. We\u2019ve been planning our features conservatively to make sure we have enough iteration time to pivot and adjust to feedback on these features as they become a reality.\n\n- Feature Risk.\nWe\u2019re building a systems-heavy game, and we know games like this thrive on having a robust feature set. That said, we\u2019re also committed to making a solid and compelling experience. Because of that, we\u2019re more willing to cut features than we are to cut the overall quality of the game.\n \nThis means if something goes wrong in development, some features might slip in the interest of making sure that what we do ship is fun to play.\n\n- Risk of Challenge vs. Frustration.\nWe\u2019re intentionally making a challenging game. Nullpoint is not a game that\u2019s meant to be beaten on the first try, and that challenge is what makes getting to the next level of (or beating) the game rewarding.\n\nOf course, the risk with challenging games is that they can end up being more frustrating than rewarding to play. We are reserving time to iterate and react to feedback from the early-access community for exactly this issue, to make sure Nullpoint doesn\u2019t become that kind of game.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Schell Games\n3 created \u00b7 6 backed\nSchell Games, an independent game studio founded in 2002 by world class game designer and award-winning author Jesse Schell, is made up of...See more"}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #11", "update_userinfo": "Thunderclap Link", "update_content": "Hey everyone,\nI apologize, but the link we sent out yesterday was broken.

I'm Lois van Baarle, sometimes better known as Loish! I'm a digital artist and animator from the Netherlands. I make my living as a freelance artist but what I love to do most is make my own digital paintings and artwork, which you can find on my website, loish.net.\nPLAY\n\nOver the years, I've gradually gained an amazing fan base who have given me so much support as my artwork and career developed into what it is today. I've regularly been asked whether there is an art book featuring my work, and I've had plans to make one for the last three years. I've researched different options and given a lot of thought into what I'd like to include in the book. With the help 3dtotal Publishing's expertise in digital art books and Kickstarter, I hope to create a book that not only showcases my art but gives a detailed behind-the-scenes look at how I create my work.\nTo make sure I can offer something special in return for supporting this project, I'm coupling the book with signed art prints and commission slots. I'm also hoping to share some of my knowledge by offering downloadable video tutorials, extensive portfolio reviews and feedback, and livestream sessions as some of the pledge options. I hope that there is something for everyone who is interested in digital art and my work!\nA mock-up of the Art of Loish book\n \"Loish is an exceptional artist apart from any derivative -- her imagery comes from a place full of originality and vibrancy\"  (Tran Nguyen, Illustrator)\nAs the project was funded so quickly (thanks so much again everyone!), 3dtotal Publishing and I have come up with some stretch goals to give you some extra rewards if we reach certain targets. We hope you like them!\nPlease note that these images are just mock-ups so the design is subject to change. The playing cards will feature 52 different images!\nThe book will of course feature images of my art, particularly my illustrations, and show my progress from someone who drew digitally as a hobby to a professional freelance artist. It will feature tips and insights, and show the process of creating my work, from initial idea and sketch to finished piece. You'll find images that range from finished digital paintings to rough sketches, studies, sketchbook pages and client work. I hope that you will find it inspiring, insightful, and most importantly, enjoyable to read through!\nMore specifically, the book will include a visual timeline of my artistic journey, with a selection of remakes of past works to show how my work has evolved over the years. I will also discuss my approaches to illustration, sketching, concept art and storyboarding. In addition to all of this I would love to be able to share some never-before-seen work and provide written tutorials and tips for fellow digital artists. \nI have been working on this project for a while and have already completed the cover art and new illustrations for the book, as well as a detailed plan for the various chapters. The lovely people at 3dtotal Publishing have already agreed to produce the book and are helping to launch the project on Kickstarter. All I need now is a bit of help from you guys to make this project happen! Please consider backing this project!\nIn terms of specifications, the book will measure 255 x 255mm in size and will be presented in a craft paper slipcase with a cutout. At 152 pages, the book will also be personally signed by me with a numbered certificate inside.\nPlease note: some of these pledge options have conditions attached which are detailed below! \n#1 A downloadable video tutorial\n...................................................................................................................\n#2 A signed copy of the book with a numbered certificate fixed inside, so you have proof that you helped make this book happen!\n...................................................................................................................\n#3 A copy of the book with a numbered certificate fixed inside, so you have proof that you helped make this book happen + one downloadable video tutorial\n...................................................................................................................\n#4 A signed copy of the book with a numbered certificate fixed inside + two downloadable video tutorials detailing the creation of a character illustration and a digital painting.\n...................................................................................................................\n#5 A copy of the book with a numbered certificate fixed inside + two downloadable video tutorials detailing the creation of a character illustration and a digital painting.\n...................................................................................................................\n#6 A signed copy of the book with a numbered certificate fixed inside + two downloadable video tutorials + a signed A4 print of an original artwork created for the book.\n...................................................................................................................\n#7 A copy of the book with a numbered certificate fixed inside + two downloadable video tutorials + an A4 print of an original artwork created for the book.\n...................................................................................................................\n#8 A signed copy of the book with a numbered certificate fixed inside + two downloadable video tutorials + a signed A4 print of an original artwork created for the book + a rough digital character bust commission (completed by 5 December 2015) in which you can request any character you like.\n...................................................................................................................\n#9 A signed copy of the book with a numbered certificate fixed inside + two downloadable video tutorials + a signed A4 print of an original artwork created for the book + a portfolio review, where you can send your portfolio and get personalized tips, advice, suggestions and a constructive review of your portfolio, plus answers to any and all questions you may have.\n...................................................................................................................\n#10 A signed copy of the book with a numbered certificate fixed inside + two downloadable video tutorials + a signed A4 print of an original artwork created for the book + a rough digital full-body character commission (completed by 5 December 2015) in which you can request any character you like.\n...................................................................................................................\n#11 A signed copy of the book with a numbered certificate fixed inside + two downloadable video tutorials + a signed A4 print of an original artwork created for the book + a signed full-body sketch commission (completed by 5 December 2015), the original copy of which will be sent to you on paper.\n...................................................................................................................\n#12 A signed copy of the book with a numbered certificate fixed inside + two downloadable video tutorials + a signed A4 print of an original artwork created for the book + a rough character bust commission created in an exclusive livestream session (completed by 5 December 2015), in which any character you request is drawn in a live stream, where you can ask any questions you may have, provide instructions for the commission, and watch it being drawn live.\nOverview of the different types of commissions\nOverview of the video tutorials\nHere's some extra information about the downloadable video tutorials to give you a bit more of an idea of what to expect. The video that comes with the \u00a35 tier will be video 1.\n\nVideo 1: This tutorial will run you through the process of creating a rough character sketch - the type of sketch I often make for my clients when working on character concepts. Starting with the rough sketch, it will show you how to choose colors for the sketch, add details and shading effects, and adjustments throughout the process. Basically, it will show you how to make a dynamic and colorful illustration with the detail and personality needed to convey a character in a time-effective way.\n\nVideo 2: This tutorial will show my process for creating a digitally painted character illustration based on one of my older pieces - basically, a re-make. I'll talk about the older illustration and the points I would like to improve in my revised version, and show you my process for drawing the characters, as well as give pointers on digital painting, backgrounds, and everything you need to create a finished character portrait.\n\nFor backers of the \u00a380, \u00a3130, \u00a3250, and \u00a3440 tiers: Backers must deliver their instructions for their commission and any reference material within 10 days of Kickstarter closing. Please specify whether you are happy with the commissioned work being posted online when it is finished. A credit line can be added to commissioned images shown if desired.\nDigital commissions are usually delivered in a digital file upon completion. If you wish to receive an A4 sized print of your commission, please state this in your initial instructions! If printed, an additional fee to cover printing and shipping will be required.\nFor backers of the \u00a380, \u00a3130, and \u00a3250 tiers: Commissioners will get to see a rough digital version of their commissioned drawing and at this time, can list any revisions (one major and any minor). Once the finished commission has been viewed digitally, one round of minor revisions will be accepted.\nFor backers of the \u00a390 tier: Backers must submit their portfolio for review digitally to Lois within 10 days of Kickstarter closing, along with any questions they may have. They may receive their feedback either in writing, chat session, or Skype session - please specify which form is preferred when submitting your portfolio! Lois will provide digital feedback by 5 December 2015 at the latest.\nFor backers of the \u00a3250 tier: Commissioners will get to see a rough version of the sketch and can list any revisions (one major and any minor). Once the sketch is complete, one round of minor revisions will be accepted before the sketch is sent out to the backers' address.\nFor backers of the \u00a3440 tier: The livestream session can take place between 9am and 9pm (Central European Time) by prearranged appointment. Backers must make contact to arrange their appointment within 10 day of Kickstarter closing. Revisions can be made during the livestream session as per commisioner's instructions. After the commission is delivered, one round of minor revisions is allowed.\n\nFor all tiers: Commissioned images can be shared and posted on the web with appropriate artist credit, but not sold or used commercially in any way, shape or form by any person(s) or organization(s) other than Lois van Baarle and 3dtotal Publishing.

Please note that we can only reship an order once if it is lost. If the second parcel is lost, we will not be able to offer a refund.\nI\u2019ve set aside time in my schedule to get the book done on time, with a detailed week-to-week plan to ensure that the deadline is met. I also put aside some time to work on the backer prizes, especially the commissions. It is the first time in a long time that I am able to accept commissions and I'm very excited to do these!\nI'm new to the world of publishing and this will be my first artbook, and Kickstarter feels like the best solution to finanance and create this book. Not only that but at the same time, it gives me the opportunity to open commission slots and make some detailed tutorials, something that I've wanted to do for a long time!\nWorking with an independent publisher that specialises in digital art books means that I'm making my book with people who understand my work, and most importantly, know what they're doing. It's really important to me to make a book that reflects who I am as an artist and is produced by professionals with experience, not only in publishing but also with crowdfunded art projects (for example the Sketch Workshop and female anatomy figure campaigns).

In the past, they were hunted heavily for their fur, and each subspecies is slowly making a comeback thanks to careful conservation efforts.\nLoin Shark - Bacon of the Sea\n   This little piggy went to the seashore... and dove right in! These funny fellows haunt noodle shops and jump from bowl to bowl when patrons aren't looking, devouring kamaboko fish cakes and anything else made of meat! They are particularly fond of crab(apples).\nGreat White photo by flickr user elevy/Elias Levy\n  Sharks are endangered worldwide.

Hurray!\n    All tiers of $15 and above will receive a postcard set of the Seawater Sweeties, a \"Fan Choice\" sticker sheet, a cellphone wallpaper and a thank you postcard.\n The initial goal of this Kickstarter is to raise $26k to order 1,000 pieces of each plush. The costs for larger plush are quite a bit higher than the cute, palm-sized Tentatrio plushes you may have helped me create last year. The goal amount also covers shipping, packaging and other reward items (stickers, etc) as well as the standard Kickstarter/Stripe fees.\nMuch like the Tentatrio Kickstarter project, all three plush are available from the start, and you can back them in any combination you'd like. <3 One of each? Of course! A trio of Eclair? You got it. You can make your final selections once the campaign ends via a backerKit survey that I'll send out.\nCrunching numbers - Budget Breakdown\nThis project is a MUCH larger and more ambitious than my previous projects, thus the costs are proportionally higher. \n*The shipping cost estimate includes shipping from my manufacturer to me, from me to backers, plus packaging costs. \n Though the original goal is for three new plush friends, other rewards might pop up along our journey.

Sugoi!\nA true treat for Anime lovers, Otaku no Video is an outrageous mockumentary that combines the superb animation that made Gainax one of Japan's best-loved animation studios with truly strange live-action interviews with \"real fans\".\nSit back and enjoy this thinly-disguised alternate history of Gainax, as a small band of Otaku set out to \"Otakunize\" the entire human race.\nSome would say that this \"Graffiti of Otaku Generation\" has been exaggerated for dramatic effect, but anyone in the industry knows it was actually toned-down to make it more believable!\nNote: now that the campaign has funded, we can accept direct signups via PayPal or a sister campaign on Indiegogo (which accepts PayPal). You can find links to these options on our Social Media page.\nWe call this 25th-Anniversary Blu-Ray the \"Otaking Edition\" for a reason. It contains both the \"Otaku no Video 1982\" OVA and the sequel, \"Zoku Otaku no Video 1985\", in Japanese with English subtitles (a total of 96 minutes of insanity) -- and two subtitled commentary tracks (curated by noted anime historian SANO Toru) featuring INOUE Kikuko (voice actress), MURAHAMA Shoji (Animation Producer and the \"cel thief\" in ONV), YAMAGA Hiroyuki (Gainax President & Founding Member), and SATO Hiroki (Anime Producer, former manager of the General Products Tokyo store and the \"garage kit otaku\" in ONV).\nOther bonus materials include a 9-panel insert sheet with mini-poster, printed program notes and other cool stuff, as well as color artwork, line art (settei), scans of the original after-recording scripts, and more. As much as possible, everything will be available both on the disc and online. And of course, all non-digital-only backers will be credited on the disc!\nWe are also considering adding an English-language commentary track, as well as additional material if we can obtain it.\nWe will be using the same HD transfer as the recent Japanese release, but using a BD50 instead of BD25 for a higher bitrate. Each of the 3 selectable subtitle tracks (Main program + 2 Commentary) will be available in both multicolor and greyscale variants (or you can watch with no subtitles if you prefer). The disc will not be region-coded, and we can ship it anywhere in the world except for Japan.\nThe Basic set packaging is a premium transparent Amaray case with a reversible sleeve insert, so there will be two cover variants to choose from.\nThis Otaking Edition will only be sold via crowdfunding and direct sales on our website. It will never be available for less than the crowdfunding price. While we currently do not intend to release a regular commercial version of OnV on BluRay, if we do it will be in different packaging and will not include any extra stretch-goal bonuses.\nFinally, we are extremely pleased to announce that the character designer of Otaku no Video, SONODA Ken'ichi, has graciously agreed to produce new artwork and graphics materials to be used as stretch goals!\nDigital backers ($5) get access to all the digital materials, including high-resolution artwork.\nBasic backers ($25) get the complete set with all the goodies. There is no \"early-bird\" level because everyone is getting early-bird pricing -- we don't want anyone to feel like they missed out.\nPremium backers ($50) get the complete set with all the goodies, plus a packaging upgrade to a chipboard slipcase with original art by Mr. Sonoda and a 32-page Manga-sized full-color Artbook. Depending on how many people sign up for the Premium set, we'll apply the economies of scale to increasing the size of the artbook.\nSecret Master of Otakudom (SMOO) backers ($75) get everything Premium backers get, plus 3 additional rewards: a limited-edition polyurethane 40mm Misty Mae minifigure kit, a special SMOO embroidered subpatch, and their name appears in a special secret disc \"easter egg\" that only they get access to! This reward is also available with the minifigure assembled and painted ($150). For more information about this reward level, see this project update (and subsequent ones as well)\nPatron backers ($100) get everything SMOO backers get (despite what it says in the description; I can't edit it alas!), plus their name also appears on a startup screen every time the disc is played (as part of the copyright screen; you can skip right to the menus). If you are a Patron who wants a painted minifigure, we will handle that as an addon after the campaign ends.\nInspector backers ($250) get everything Patrons get, plus they will receive one of the actual production check discs to test and keep -- and thus, be the first to see the (hopefully!) finished Blu-Ray.\nNote about Extra Copies: If you want an extra copy or two, don't worry; we will make addons available after the campaign ends (it's just simpler to do it that way rather than have a ton of different reward categories).\nWe also have several special support levels that will gradually go down in price until someone snaps them up.\nCel Patron backers get everything a Patron gets, plus one of 4 original OnV production cels, two of them with backgrounds and signed by The Great and Terrible Otaking OKADA Toshio! Here are the cels:\nClick here for high-resolution scans\nSonoda Sketch backers get everything a Patron gets, plus they get a personally inscribed sketch of their favorite OnV character or scene. Here's some examples of sketches Mr. Sonoda did for backers of the Bubblegum Crisis set. Note that these rewards will be shipped from Japan and customs duty may apply.\nClick here for a high-resolution version\nClick here for a high-resolution version\nThe three Colorful backers get everything a Patron gets, plus they also get one of the full-color B4-size (250 x 353mm / 9.8 x 13.9\") original illustrations Mr. Sonoda is creating for this release -- personally inscribed if desired. Here are are sketches of the designs Mr. Sonoda has decided to proceed with:\nThis one is actually 2 B4 illustrations!\nThe three Immortalized backers get everything a Patron gets, plus they also will be used as a model for a character in the mini-manga Mr. Sonoda is drawing!\nAnd finally, the Otaking backer gets everything a Patron gets, plus he/she gets listed as the Otaking on the packaging! And we'll include 4 extra sets as well.\nOne thing we are doing a little differently on this project is that we're charging a shipping fee on all orders, as opposed to giving US backers \"free\" shipping (which isn't really free, it's just bundled in). One reason we're doing this is because it helps establish the correct customs value for international shipments.\nCustoms costs, VAT and \"processing fees\" are a major annoyance for international backers, and we want to do everything we can to minimize or eliminate this hassle. That's why we're pleased to announce that this project is...\nThis means that we'll be shipping copies directly to fulfillment houses in Canada and the UK (who will then reship to backers in the EU). The extra cost of doing this (and the customs fees we pay upfront) have been baked into the shipping charge on a country-by-country basis:\nUS: $5 shipping (so the basic blu-ray is $30 total)\nCanada: $12 shipping\nEU: $15 shipping\nElsewhere: $15 shipping\nWe will ship to all other international backers directly from the USA using USPS International First Class Mail. Backers in Australia, New Zealand, Switzerland and Norway should not have any extra fees because the price of the set ($25) is below the personal exemption for those countries.\nWe have created a Customs Estimator spreadsheet that backers in other countries can use. If your country is not listed, we would greatly appreciate it if you could research how costs are calculated in your country and let us know so we can update it.\nAs with the Bubblegum Crisis Ultimate Edition, there are going to be opportunities for you to get involved in the actual work of producing the set. Backers who do substantial work on the project will get credit on the packaging and on the disc, an IMDb listing, extra copies of the set for family and friends, and a special CrowdProduction Team T-Shirt.\nCrowdProduction opportunities include (but are not limited to):\nCleaning up and curating the images.\nTranslation of the commentary tracks.\nSubtitle proofreading.\nPackaging, Disc Art and Logo design.\nWiki Editing & Liner Notes Research.\nContact us if you're interested in taking on the challenge.\nOne of the most popular bonus items in the Bubblegum Crisis set was an embroidered patch. The Otaking Edition will also have a patch, but this time, in a diabolical ploy to enlist you as our Marketing Minions\u2122, the size of the patch depends on how successful you are in getting the word out about this project.\nEach goal achieved adds 1 square-inch to the patch, up to 16 square-inches (4x4\" before laser-cutting):\nBasic goal is met in the first 24 / 48 / 72 / 144 hours -- demolished in 13.5 hours\n400, 500, 600, 700, and 800 Facebook likes.\n1400, 1500, 1600, 1700 and 1800 @AnimEigo Twitter followers.\n100, 125, 150, 175, and 200 Tumblr followers.\n750, 1000, 1200, 1400 and 1600 tweets using the #otakunovideo hashtag.\nWhen I started doing a graphic for this, it ended up looking like a Bingo card, so it was only appropriate that there be a free square... but after the first day, it's a free column...\nTo help you spread the word about the project we've created a social media HQ page with all the links you'll need.\nOnce the campaign has completed, we'll come up with several designs (and you'll be able to try your hand at it) and then run a poll to help determine what the patch will look like. Here's how the Bubblegum Crisis patch turned out:\nThe following stretch goals have already been reached:\n999 Backers: Cover Up(grade) -- Mr. Sonoda will create new color cover art for the package. This will also unlock new reward levels that deliver the actual artwork. Unlocked on Day 3!\n250 Backers: Mini-Manga -- Mr. Sonoda will draw a 4 page dojinshi comic, similar to the one in the Japanese Blu-Ray release -- one idea we've kicked around is having it be about his experiences with US Otaku. The comic will be available both digitally and as an insert in the Blu-Ray package. This will also unlock 3 new rewards that immortalize a real fan in the dojinshi! Unlocked with 6 days to go!\nThese stretch goals are currently pending:\n1500 Backers or $100,000: Comprehensible Commentary -- a new english-language commentary track featuring author and anime historian Gilles Poitras.\n1700 Backers or $120,000: Today is a good day to Subtitle -- an extra subtitle track will be added, transcribed from the original Klingon by renowned tlhIngan linguist qurgh lungqlj.\nGoals Pending: Comically Awesome -- The dojinshi comic will be printed as an exclusive limited-edition doujinshi in both Japanese and English (8 pages total). Basic backers will get it as a stand-alone B&W doujinshi, Premium backers will get it as part of an expanded art-book.\nSince the percentage of backers who are choosing the Premium set is much higher than expected, it is very likely that as goals are reached, we'll adjust the higher goals down (and/or add new intermediate ones).\n Note: Digital backers do not count towards stretch goals.\nCan I sign up using PayPal?\nYes, now that the campaign has funded, we can accept direct signups via PayPal or a sister campaign on Indiegogo (which accepts PayPal). You can find links to these options on our Social Media page.\nWhat about subtitles in other languages?\nWe are sticking with English (and possibly Klingon) on this set for several reasons.\nFirst, our license is Universe-wide, English and Klingon-only, excluding Japan.\nSecond, and more importantly, a major reason the Bubblegum Crisis set had authoring delays was that it had so many subtitle tracks (6 languages x 2 variants) that it caused the authoring system to crash! For Otaku no Video, we currently need 6 subtitle tracks (1 main program + 2 commentary tracks x 2 variants) and the main subtitle tracks are \"bigger\" than the Bubblegum Crisis tracks because we need to caption things all over the screen, so we want to err on the side of caution -- and to not be able to add those Klingon subtitles would be extremely dishonorable and likely result in us being on the wrong side of a sharp Bat'leth!\nHow are you going to handle the \"Portrait of an Otaku\" SD video segments?\nOne of the things that makes Otaku no Video so much fun are the fake interviews. However, since they were shot and edited in SD video, integrating them is a little tricky.\nThe main issue is that the animation segments are 24-frames per second progressive HD (\"24p\") while the video segments are 60-fields per second interlaced SD (\"60i\").\nWhile we can (and will) upconvert the 60i SD to 60i HD (and do a little cleanup while we are at it), combining 24p HD and 60i HD in the same program requires some rather tricky player programming -- and all the compatibility risks that entails. Complicating matters even further is the fact that the people on the commentary tracks talk right through the transitions between the animation and the live-action.\nTo address these issues, the current plan is to do the following:\nWhen you play the main program, the Portrait of an Otaku segments will be displayed in 24p -- this was how the Japanese Blu-Ray handled them. Converting from 60i to 24p (or more precisely, 48i displayed as 24p) will result in some motion artifacts (\"judder\"), but most people won't notice them.\nIn addition, we'll include the interviews as separate bonus materials in 60i.\nAlso, we'll have an option to watch just the animated segments.\nCan I order extra copies?\nNot as part of the Kickstarter, but we will make additional copies available (at a discount) as an add-on after the campaign ends.\nWhat about doing a challenge-coin?\nWe love the challenge coin we did for Bubblegum Crisis, and we'd like to do one for Otaku no Video as well, but we think it's best to do it as a separate add-on. After the campaign is over, we'll poll people to figure out how many would like a coin, and if it is feasible, we'll do one.\nWho is running the project?\nRobert Woodhead is one of the founders of AnimEigo, one of the original wave of Anime releasing companies. Over the years AnimEigo has released hundreds of Anime and Samurai film titles in both dubbed and subtitled form. He's the creative and technical guy.\nUEKI Natsumi is Robert's wife and partner. She's a level-headed businesswoman who describes her career as \"a quarter-century of successfully preventing Robert from bankrupting the company.\"\nTrivia: Natsumi and Robert were introduced to each other by OKADA Toshio, one of the founders of Gainax. Okada-sensei was the inspiration for the character of Tanaka in Otaku no Video.\n So you see, Otaku no Video holds special meaning for us. :)", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhile we are confident that we will be able to meet or beat the February release date, a video production project such as this can suffer unexpected delays.\n\nOn the Bubblegum Crisis project, we ended up shipping 3 months late, in large part because the authoring was so complex that we broke the authoring system and had to find workarounds. Fortunately, this project is considerably simpler -- in fact, our real goal is to give you a very Otaku Xmas.\n\nWhat we can promise is that we will take the time to get things right, even if that means slipping the release date, and that we will keep you fully informed every step of the way -- the Bubblegum Crisis project had over 50 project updates.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #46", "update_userinfo": "Gunsmith Cats Explosive Edition Campaign is Live!", "update_content": "Dear Backers,\nI completely forgot to post an update when the campaign went live!

Well, most of your crew.\n\"....aaaaaaaaAAAAAAAAaaaaaaaa.....\"\nEach journey, you\u2019ll pick your captain, officers, and equipment. Each pick will give you a leg up when dealing with an encounter in specific ways.\nHowever, you can't apply all strategies to every situation.

For example, an unexpected Singularity Fissure could open up in the Deck 12 Latrines, making for an unpleasant bathroom break. Maybe someone could accidentally leave an airlock open as you jump to light-speed, making the inside part of the ship the outside part. Or, your Away Team could inadvertently incur the wrath of a Grobulous Rex while exploring an alien jungle. We're not sure what will happen with that last one, but it's probably not good.\n\nThe point is, no matter how prepared and vigilant a Captain is, the cosmic chaos of the Orion Trail can end a voyage in the disastrous blink of an eye (or four). \n\nBut that\u2019s okay!

There are over 50 encounters for you to discover, and each one has a variety of decisions that can change based on your current situation.\n\nDon't count on seeing the same choices every time.\nLikewise, while you may steadfastly order your crew to fire all neutron torpedos at the Bul\u2019war Gigabeast closing in on your ship, things may not play out the way you expect. Actions have a range of outcomes that may pleasantly reward or vehemently punish you. Accrue bonuses from your crew and equipment to increase the chance of a successful die roll.\n\nIn the cold heart of space, there are no guarantees.\nSTILL NOT SURE IF YOU'D LIKE THE GAME?\nClick the red button to fulfill your wildest dreams!\nIf you had a chance to play the prototype, you may be wondering \u201cWait, is that it? Do they plan on doing more?\u201d to which we\u2019d reply \u201cGreat questions! No, and yes.\u201d in that order.\nWe think that the prototype is a kernel of something that could be really great, but there are many improvements to make. We\u2019ve done a lot of discussing, late-night thinking, and planning for how we\u2019d improve the game, which we used to arrive at our $90,000 ask to you guys.\nTo give you a sense of how we plan on expanding the game (before stretch goals), here\u2019s a list of changes and improvements we\u2019ll be making to the game.\nMore Content\nThe current prototype has just a fraction of the content we want to have in the game, and we\u2019ve learned a lot about what makes a fun encounter vs. a frustratingly random one.\nDynamic Encounters\nWe want the encounters to react a little more to your previous choices and current circumstances. Certain encounters may have special, and otherwise hidden, options be revealed if you have the right Captain, Officer, or Technology equipped. This adds some fun (and unexpected) twists to your playthrough.\nMore Art\nIf you can\u2019t tell, we love the art style of the game, and we want it to be everywhere. We also want your choices to be visually reflected in more areas of the game, so our current plan is to have the Captains and Officers you pick actually show up on the bridge, along with Away Missions.\nAway Missions\nCurrently in the prototype, we only have encounters that take place in the celestial heavens. In the full game, we plan to have a second type called Away Missions, where you pick an officer and a gaggle of redshirts to beam down to a planet, enemy ship, or other space-thing and embark on a longer set of mini-encounters.\nDuring a foray, your Away Team could suffer mishaps and poor judgement (resulting in a hapless Redshirt biting the dust).  Your redshirts will basically act as the Officer\u2019s health, so it\u2019s up to you whether you want to keep pressing your luck for that ancient alien artifact, or risk losing the entire Away Team (including the Officer)!\n\"I think this is going pretty well...\"\nBetter Feedback for Encounter Results\nA big part of the game is picking an option and finding out how well you performed at your attempt. Right now, we\u2019re not doing a great job at the latter, so we have plans to better inform you whether that 7 you got was good or bad.\nOur soundtrack will feature 12 new songs made by the one and only Rainbow Kitten, an extra-dimensional being of immense power and rhythm. They created the soundtrack for Enemy Mind, and we're excited to go on another space adventure with them. Take a listen to some tracks from our prototype:\nThe music was made with the SID emulation engine on an Elektron Monomachine. You'll recognize the SID's distinctive sound from your fondest memories of gaming on a C64 back in the day.\n(From Left to Right)\nSchell Games (@schellgames) is, well, us. We\u2019ve done a lot of game development for clients, and have launched a few of our own internal projects. Orion Trail came out of a week-long game jam that Schell Games hosts every year, and everyone at the studio is excited to see the game become a reality. \nJesse Schell (@jesseschell) is our fearless leader and the head honcho of Schell Games. You may recognize his name from some awesome game design books, or perhaps some talks. When we brought Jesse this idea, he shook his head in despair. We took that as a yes!\nDave Bennett (@davebbennett) is the designer who came up with the general concept of the game. He was one of the writers for Puzzle Clubhouse, and likes space games a little too much. You can blame him whenever you feel like your inevitable death was unfair.\nEvan Brown (@etb342) was the artist who laid down the proto-pixels of the earliest concepts of the game. He worked on one of our other internal projects, Enemy Mind, which has a whole bunch of awesome pixel art. Basically, he\u2019s responsible for setting the style and tone of all of the art in the game.\nWithout your help, we won\u2019t have enough funding to make Orion Trail the game we hope it could become. Kickstarter also gives you, our backers, a platform to help steer the course of development in a meaningful way.\nThe money raised by this Kickstarter will be used to fund the rest of the team. We'll staff up with additional programmers, artists, writers, QA, a sound person, and a producer to make sure we make the game in a reasonable amount of time.\nHere's a breakdown of where the money will be put to use:", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nVideo game development is fraught with the unexpected, and things can often take longer than planned. However, we are incredibly passionate about this project, and a lot of effort has gone into researching, planning and budgeting.\n\nIf any problems begin to crop up, we will be as honest and transparent as we can with you, and let you know what the problems are and how we\u2019re addressing them.\n\nIf you have questions for us, let us know through Twitter or e-mail!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #55", "update_userinfo": "Free Content Update, Captain Forever Crossover, and announcing Orion Trail: VR Edition for the Samsung Gear VR!", "update_content": "Howdy!

In case you missed your chance this time, join our mailing list above or get on the waiting list below.\nOpenMV Cam gives any project the power of advanced machine vision with the ease of writing simple Micro Python scripts.\nMore than just a camera board, OpenMV Cam is a complete vision solution that uses a simple IDE, rapidly integrates into any hardware project, supports shields for expanded capabilities, and already has a community behind it.\nDetect a face when someone is standing at your front door, take their photo, contact your smartphone, then ring the doorbell automatically;\nFind a marker on your robot's charging station;\nUse color detection to sort M&M's detect and collect colored balls;\nDetect a landing zone object for your quadcopter/hobby UAV;\nRecord video from your UAV, Rover, Kite;\nTake time lapse photos for security, science, and more;\nControl Pan/Tilt servos to create an object tracker or foam dart sentry gun;\nCompete with an edge in FIRST Robotics Competition, Sparkfun AVC, and others;\nTeach and learn machine vision concepts.\nThe difficult, time-consuming work of machine vision is already done for you, leaving more time for creativity. These are just a few ideas. So much more is possible with OpenMV Cam's many capabilities. And all it takes are small Python scripts.\nPython on Board\nOpenMV Cam has a Micro Python interpreter on board, so your scripts run on the camera module itself, accessing compiled vision algorithms.\nYou write scripts in the OpenMV IDE's syntax-highlighting editor. From the IDE, download and run your scripts, display what the camera sees, select templates to match, and tune color detection. Example scripts help get you started.\nCount pips on a die (idea by Damage)\nWindows and Linux are currently supported. The MacOS port is in progress.\nControl or Be Controlled\nYou can control OpenMV Cam with your Arduino, mbed, or other microcontroller over I2C, Serial, or SPI protocols. Or, OpenMV Cam can be in control, with multiple GPIO pins broken out including ADC, DAC, PWM, and the serial protocols mentioned.\nOpenMV Cam pinout\nExpandable With Shields\nOpenMV Cam is designed to be expanded with optional shields. You can add an LCD Shield, Prototyping Shield, and/or Thermopile Array Shield to your reward as an accessory. A WiFi shield is still in development and we'll keep you updated on our progress.\nLCD Shield\nThe shield features a 128x160 pixel, 1.8\" TFT color LCD on a shield that mounts on the back of OpenMV Cam. Our prototype is pictured right of the OpenMV Cam. The final version omits the switches and mounting holes but will look similar, otherwise. If you want one, just add $19 to your pledge.\nThermopile Array Shield\nA shield for the Melexis MLX90620 (or '621 if available) 16x4 Thermopile Array is available. Pictured below is the prototype shield mounted to an OpenMV Cam.\nWith it you can overlay a heat map on your images, such as in the demonstration below, picturing Ibrahim's soldering iron in no light condition. This demo was done with a prototype LCD shield that is not yet available.\nPrototyping Shield\nA prototyping shield is perfect for experimenting. You can add one to your reward as an accessory. The etched prototype is intended to give you an idea of size and layout. The final version will have soldermask, silkscreen, and plated through holes as rendered below.\nNight Vision\nOne thing we didn't mention in the video is that OpenMV Cam can see in the dark with onboard IR LEDs installed in every board, and using an IR lens (available as an add-on accessory). The picture below was taken in no light condition using an IR lens with the IR LEDs illuminated.\nLenses\nOpenMV Cam uses an M12 lens mount so lenses are interchangeable. Every OpenMV Cam comes with a general purpose M12 lens (40\u00b0-60\u00b0 FOV) with IR filter for improved daylight performance. You can add as accessories:\nGeneral purpose IR lens, \nWide angle lens (3.6mm 96\u00b0 FOV), and/or \nTelephoto lens (12mm, 26.2\u00b0 FOV).\nOpen Source\nOpenMV Cam is totally open source and we're building a community around this platform to improve, add, and share. OpenMV Cam can do a lot right now, but as a community, working together, we can revolutionize machine vision for hobby electronics, education, and artistic pursuits. We'd like you to join us.\nGithub repository\nOpenMV Cam group\nProject Status\nWe've been working on OpenMV Cam over the last year and we're ready to make it available.\nWe're ready to manufacture. The main camera module hardware has been through several revisions and is ready to produce. \nSoftware testing. Our beta testers have been helping us improve the firmware and IDE over the last several months and will continue to do so.\nWe have selected a US-based manufacturer, MacroFab, who came highly recommended from the folks behind the Re:Load Pro Kickstarter project. \nShipping and fulfillment services are handled by this same manufacturer; we've been working out all the details since December.\nAffordability and Kickstarter\nTo make OpenMV Cam affordable, we have to lower component and manufacturing costs, and to do that we have to make a lot of units at once. In turn, the total amount required for manufacturing is pretty high, and that's why we're asking for your help.\nRewards and Accessories\nWe greatly appreciate any support you can offer. To help us revolutionize machine vision and get an OpenMV Cam of your own, please take a look at the available reward tiers below and pledge for the reward you want, then add accessories shown below. Thank you!\nFor example, to get one 5-Pack ($239) with a single thermopile array shield (+$139), select the $239 reward tier and pledge $378 (=$239+$139). \n Specifications\nMCU: STM32F427, 180MHz, 225 DMIPS, 256K SRAM, 2M Flash, DMA/FPU/DSP/DCMI/SDIO/2D Acceleration\nSensor: OV2640 (2MP JPEG but see Performance) [datasheet, pdf]\nInterchangeable M12 lens\n2x IR LEDS \n2x Servo headers\n20 I/Os: USART/SPI/I2C/PWM\nUSB 2.0 Full Speed\nuSD interface: SDIO (4-bit mode)\nCurrent draw is approximately 140mA, steady state\ncurrent draw\nPerformance\nMemory and speed are important in a machine vision system. We selected the familiar, hackable STM32F4 line, an STM32F427 running 180MHz. \nNative DCMI and SDIO hardware interfaces to camera and microSD, respectively, are managed with DMA, freeing CPU cycles. \nThe 2MP OV2640 sensor provides JPEG compression onboard, enabling faster transfer rates for streaming or recording. It supports bitmap output formats in several resolutions including color and grayscale, each appropriate for certain machine vision applications.\nAbout Us\nIbrahim Abdelkader is a maker and long time programmer with multiple CS degrees. Intrigued with machines that can see, and spurred by disappointment in currently available machine vision systems, he created OpenMV Cam to be affordable and as easily integrated as other sensors. The project is all open source because he wants to give back to the open source and maker communities. \nMichael Shimniok has been building autonomous robots for several years. Most recently he led the team to convert his 1986 Jeep Grand Wagoneer, Troubled Child, into a self-driving vehicle that won the 2014 Sparkfun AVC. Machine vision became a passion after experimenting with a vintage Game Boy camera on his first competition robot. He joined the OpenMV Cam project to raise the bar on hobby robotics.\nBot Thoughts LLC: Michael Shimniok started blogging in 2007 and building and selling hobby electronics boards in 2012. This micro-empire of geekery became Bot Thoughts LLC in Dec 2014 and Michael is the sole owner.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOpenMV cam hardware and software already exists and has been under development for the past year, significantly reducing technical and schedule risks. The capabilities listed above are already in place and the software and hardware has been tested. The hardware design has been reviewed by our manufacturer and is ready to build.\n\nThe maturity of the hardware also addresses schedule risks due to design errors. In addition, we will be manufacturing OpenMV Cam in at least three batches of increasing quantity, e.g., 10, 100, and all remaining units to reduce schedule risk due to design or assembly errors. In addition, the manufacturer will be testing each board using software and test jigs we provide. Finally, I plan to be on site with the manufacturer for the initial run to catch and fix problems early on.\n\nWe recognized early on the potential risks related to fabrication, assembly, and fulfillment and so we chose to outsource all of these functions. MacroFab specializes in end-to-end services for projects just like this, providing packaging and fulfillment services in addition to PCB fabrication and assembly.\n\nComponent part availability and lead times are another possible source of schedule risk. Our manufacturer provides turnkey assembly, meaning they find the parts for us and we have already identified alternate parts to ensure availability for orders supporting up to at least 1000 units. If we are funded beyond 1000 units, there is some risk of delay due to availability for subsequent batches.\n\nWe feel we've addressed the most likely risks to schedule, we believe technichal risk is very low due to the time invested already, and we've addressed any cost risks we face by carefully estimating all the forseeable costs and allowing enough margin to address unknowns while leaving enough to sustain future production and development. I'll put my 20 years of IT experience to good use in planning and working hard to meet our timeline.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #54", "update_userinfo": "Transitioning Updates to OpenMV.io", "update_content": "Happy New Year everyone! \nAt this time last year this project was in the dumps.

You'll hunt monsters and cook with magic in a competition like no other!\nThe campaign has ended, but you can preorder Battle Chef Brigade HERE! On top of that, for a limited time, the physical rewards will be available on BackerKit! Note: do not preorder if you're already a backer!\nYou can also join our journey on Twitter, Facebook and the Trinket Newsletter! Thank you all so much, Battle Chefs!\nMagic and cooking fit together perfectly in so many ways. Imagine fire knives that slice AND sear, mystical ingredients, and chefs' spells whirling around immaculate dishes.\nCooking in games is always a simple affair, represented entirely by minigame or crafting mechanics. Not so in Battle Chef Brigade. Here, you decide what dishes to make. Each elimination round of the Battle Chef Royale will pit you against an opposing chef in a competition to wow the judges with your tasty dishes and culinary skills and spells.\n Read more about Ziggy in Update #10!\n Consoles?\nAfter a lot of deliberation, we've decided not to add WiiU, PS4, 3DS, or Vita stretch goals yet. We want to keep our focus on making the game the absolute best it can be. More playable chefs, more environments, voice over, epic summoning spells, and a new game mode are the next steps Battle Chef Brigade needs to become the amazing game we all envision. Since we're only three developers, we don't want to make giant promises far in advance. We want to finish building a phenomenal game for you before spreading it across more platforms.\nThat said, you can rest assured that our goal is to bring Battle Chef Brigade to consoles and handhelds. We're now a licensed Nintendo, Sony, and Microsoft developer AND we're using the Unity3D game engine. That means that when the time is right to bring BCB to consoles, we'll be in excellent shape to do so. In fact, the game already supports PS4 and Xbox One controllers on PC! We love our consoles and really want to play Battle Chef Brigade on them :)\nOf course, after this campaign we'll keep you updated on Battle Chef Brigade's progress and will want your feedback about which platforms you want to play on next!\nCheck out Update #9 for more information about Add-Ons and how to increase your pledge!\nBattle Chefs stock their pantries by hunting monsters in the Arena! Monsters abound, each with their own dangers and ingredients.\nUnique Style - Chefs have their own hunting abilities and upgrades. Control Mina\u2019s whirling knives, Thrash\u2019s blood-hungry sword, and Kirin\u2019s mechanical traps!\nWild Monsters - Ingredients aren't just sitting on the shelf in Battle Chef Brigade! Each monster can drop different cuts of meat but only the most precise chefs get the best ones.\nEcology - The monsters are part of an ecosystem that you can influence and upset. You can feed the birds to get more eggs, but letting the other monsters snack on them might be very dangerous.\nPlayers must concoct unique dishes before running out of time in each round. Carefully season, sauce, and transform your ingredients to win the adulation of the judges.\nCreativity - You\u2019re in charge of deciding what dishes to create! Be mindful of the round timer and the judges' picky tastes. If you want to serve pan-seared dragon shank with raw squid stomach, go right ahead. Keep in mind that not everyone likes uncooked seafood or even dragon meat!\nSpells - The best meals are made with skill AND magic. Accelerate cooking times with an inferno, super-season a dish, and swap tastes and textures. Eat your own dishes to regain health and mana - just make sure they're edible first!\nJudging - The sternest gourmands, from meat-loving Orcs to diet-obsessed Elves, will be tasting your dishes. Keep their gustatory preferences in mind and make sure not to serve them any uncooked, burnt, or over-seasoned food.\nUse your chef's individual skills and personality to win the judges' favor. Battle Chef Brigade stirs together celebrity chefs and fantasy characters to produce its quirky cast.\nMina - Fast and Fearless! Mina\u2019s inexperience sometimes leads her into culinary danger, but she\u2019s got the speed to get any dish back on track.\nThrash - Powerful and Brazen! When your sword thirsts for meet, feed it. Thrash\u2019s blade increases in power when given meat and can then be used for all manner of explosive Orc magic.\nKirin - Sly and Scientific! Beware the technological tricks and traps of the Elves. Precision is the name of Kirin\u2019s game.\nZiggy - Twisted and Undead! His muscles may be decaying, but he can summon sous skeletons and spirits to pick up the slack.\nCezar - Stout and Stubborn! Cezar might be tough to get moving but his mighty cleaver is ready to decapitate any beast.\nAnd More - Unique and memorable characters are at the core of Battle Chef Brigade, so there are more to come. Your support can help us expand the playable and supporting cast!\nMina, Thrash, and Kirin will be playable at launch. The rest of the chefs will compete against you and take on big roles in the story. We'd love for your favorite chef to be playable and your support can help us reach our goal of making all the chefs playable!\nDuring the tournament, you\u2019ll have opportunities to upgrade your chef and tools!\nCookware - Custom tools are your most important allies in the kitchen. Larger pots and pans are necessary for cooking huge ingredients while other special cookware can give your food crucial bonuses.\nSpecialty Tools - Unique equipment like a Pasta Cutter, Pie Tin, or Wok can help transform mundane ingredients into fantastic dishes.\nSpells - Each chef can learn new spells for the Kitchen and Arena during the tournament. Spells range from super-powered attacks to dish-saving cooking aids.\nSound design and music are key parts of the Battle Chef Brigade experience. Sound effects in particular are critical to grounding our fantasy monsters and cooking with the real world.\nIn fact, gaining the means to continue paying our Sound Designer, George Hufnagl, is one of the reasons this Kickstarter exists. He's already done a phenomenal job crafting the game's soundscape, from bushes rustling in the Forest Arena to the Dragon's flame-throwing roar. Here's an in-depth sound design walkthrough of an old prototype from George.\nWe tasked Tom Dunkin with composing a few songs for the demo and Kickstarter. With funding, we'll be expanding this list a lot! Per-chef themes and context-sensitive dynamic music are two audio features we're really excited about.\nFull Release - Battle Chef Brigade will be available for Windows, Mac, and Linux. The full release is planned for multiplatform distribution on Steam and as a DRM-free download through the Humble Store.\nBeta Access - We will be releasing a pre-release build of Battle Chef Brigade for feedback using Steam Early Access or the Humble Store.\nOther Platforms - Battle Chef Brigade is also a great fit for consoles and some handhelds. Based on time, your interests, and the success of this campaign, we\u2019re hoping to spread BCB to more platforms!\nWe quit our game industry jobs because we wanted the creative freedom to make something awesome. We released two tiny mobile games soon after forming Trinket, including the very well received Color Sheep. Now we're ready to tackle the game we really quit our jobs to make: Battle Chef Brigade.\nWe've self-funded BCB for over a year now. We spent a lot of time prototyping the creative Kitchen mode, since it\u2019s the toughest design challenge. These prototypes were invaluable for nailing down which aspects of cooking could be nicely abstracted into clear, fun mechanics and which were just too clunky. It\u2019s too bad scratch-and-sniff monitors never took off.\nOn the programming side, we've been able to keep building on our years of industry experience. Integrating new characters, foods, and chef challenges will be a straightforward process since we've been preparing for them all along. We invested a good chunk of our time building a robust combat system that integrates into our animation tools.\nOur biggest remaining tasks are related to our illustrated, hand-animated art style. There are very few shortcuts to creating hand-drawn animations and environments. Our tools help smooth out the process, but each chef and monster still requires a lot of Photoshop time! We'll use some money from this campaign to contract more artists when necessary.\nWe'll be updating backers with our progress regularly, especially on our Dev Blog, TIGSource, and Twitter! Open development and community are really important to us!\nDigital Download copy of BATTLE CHEF BRIGADE for PC, MAC, and LINUX (DRM-free + Steam key)\nA stunning digital ART BOOK PDF, chock-full of concept art, sketches, progression images, and details from Battle Chef Brigade's development.\nThe digital SOUNDTRACK, guaranteed to transport you into the rich world and delightful mood of Battle Chef Brigade.\nEARLY ACCESS to the BETA and access to BACKER FORUMS AND POLLS! Be the first to play Battle Chef Brigade and to help steer its development!\nYour chefs will discover BACKER-ONLY ITEMS in the tournament. The items will include a COOKWARE SET, a SECRET SAUCE, and a SCROLL, each more mysterious and powerful than the last! Your dishes, tools, and chefs will have that special something that no one else has! Note: these are not pay-to-win items. They'll look cool and deepen the experience, but won't make the game unfair to players without them.\nYou get a glorious Battle Chef Brigade T-Shirt and Poster combo. Your friends will be twice-baked with envy when they come upon your battle-ready form and fortress.\nT-Shirt Design\nWe'll work with you to bring a monster from your imagination to life! Over the course of a few Skype/Hangouts/Phone calls, you'll share your vision, review concept art, and assist in naming your monster.\nWe\u2019ll work with you to create an illustration of you as a BATTLE CHEF BRIGADE VETERAN. You'll provide a picture of yourself (or someone worthy of immortalizing) and suggestions for what fantasy race you'd like to be. Our Creative Director Eric will then draw you in an epic pose that will be used in-game and a trailer to introduce and explain the history of the Battle Chef Brigade. We'll also send you the image so you can print it or use it as an avatar image across the web!\nWe\u2019ll work with you to create a CELEBRITY GUEST JUDGE in the game. We\u2019ll need a picture, some of your favorite and least favorite foods, and what sort of hungry fantasy character you'd like to be (orc, wizard, elf, etc). We'll then transform you into an awesome animated in-game judge, ready to mock and praise players' creations!\n                                                                    The three of us met in 2009 while working for Disney Interactive\u2019s Wideload Games. Over the next three years we collaborated on Disney\u2019s Guilty Party (Wii), Avengers Initiative: Hulk (iOS / Android using Unity), and a host of unannounced Disney projects.\nIn 2012, we quit to form Trinket Studios, where we quickly built up a handful of games and prototypes. Color Sheep and Orion\u2019s Forge were released to wide acclaim in early 2013, after which we began work on Battle Chef Brigade!\nTom Eastman @TrinketTom   (President + Programming + Design)\nIt\u2019s always been Tom's plan to start an indie studio that makes unique, fun games. The path to BCB and this Kickstarter wound through a lot of ugly games in high school, Dartmouth College Computer Science, internships at Garage Games and Wideload Games, and a few years at Disney Interactive. He's thrilled to finally have everything lining up for Trinket!\nEric Huang @TrinketEric   (Creative Director + Design)\nEric grew up as a daydreamer heavily influenced by all the games he watched his older brothers play. Fighters, RPGs, and beat em ups sent him off in the trajectory he now travels, where animations, comics, and friendships have all added to his ever-growing love of creating. Though he may not be the most skillful or frequent gamer, the starry, childhood eyes he has for the medium only continue to be inspired and amazed.\nBen Perez @TrinketBen  (Programming + Design)\nBen is driven by opportunities to learn and grow as a game developer, which served him well while obtaining a B.S. in Computer Game Development from DePaul University. At Wideload/Disney, however, he felt more and more creatively constrained. With Trinket, he's elated to have so much freedom to focus on fun gameplay and satisfying programming problems.\nOf course, Battle Chef Brigade wouldn't be possible without a lot of help from our friends and contractors!\nGeorge Hufnagl @grhufnagl  (Sound Designer)\nGeorge's considerable experience and ebullient personality made him the ideal candidate to bring the audio of Battle Chef Brigade to life. You know you've got the right sound designer when you'd be thrilled to ship a game with just the sounds effects that come out of his mouth!\nTom Dunkin @tomaeusd  (Composer)\nTom is a self-taught musician from Washington State who composes purely by ear. His primary instrument is the guitar, but he dabbles in others such as the piano, trombone, theremin, stylophone, and anything else he can get his hands on. Most importantly, he went through a Mongolian throat singing phase in college.\nYann Blomquist  (Environment Artist)\nYann is a concept artist and illustrator currently residing across the sea in London. He attended the same college as Eric in New York, majoring in cartooning but not without some armorsmithing on the side. Though his friends may think he belongs to a time of knights, or a world of werewolves,Yann is perfectly content creating his darkly magical characters in his many sketchbooks while munching on some chocolate.\nChristine Chong @mayshing  (Colorist)\nChristine is a freelance illustrator, animator, and premium comic artist on inkblazers.com. Her passion is telling stories of others and her life through manga, comics, animation, illustration. She enjoys learning about different cultures, traveling, helping others, a good cup of tea and coffee and spending time with family and friends.\nMike Antonicelli @superfantastik  (Colorist)\nMike Antonicelli is an independent artist and animation consultant. His consulting company, Superfantastik CG Animation, has partnered to create games with Disney and Marvel, among other clients. Mike worked alongside Tom, Eric, and Ben at Wideload Games.\nTwitter: Follow and Tweet!\nFacebook: Like and Share!\nSign up: Our Newsletter!\nThank you so much for your support :)\nWe can't wait to serve you a perfectly-cooked Battle Chef Brigade!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nGames are always hard to make and very complex, so there are rarely sure bets. Luckily, we've already been through plenty of development cycles, including together at Wideload / Disney. With multiple shipped titles under our belts, we've been preparing for Battle Chef Brigade for a long time.\n\nFinancial: We quit our jobs at Wideload/Disney so that we'd have creative freedom, but we made sure to save up first. On top of our savings, Color Sheep sales are still trickling in, though we'll be relying on this campaign to cover contractor and software costs. Here's the breakdown for our goal:\n30% Environment Art\n20% Colorists\n15% Sound Design\n10% Music\n10% Kickstarter/Payment Fees\n10% Taxes\n 5% Software Licenses\n\nSchedule: It's super hard to stick to a schedule in any creative project. We've already prototyped (and cut) lots of mechanics, smoothed out the art pipeline, and planned the remainder of the game. In addition, we've been working in Unity for over four years now, so we know which dead-ends to avoid. That said, we've set the estimated completion date to be further away than we anticipate. We're hoping to pleasantly surprise everyone with an early release, but games (especially Kickstarted ones!) don't have a great track record of finishing early.\n\nThank you for backing Battle Chef Brigade and supporting Trinket!

CARL PREDICTS CROWDFUNDING\nUPDATE #2: NEW REWARD TIERS, GET ANIMATED, 50K!\nUPDATE #1: HELP MAKE CARL'S DREAM A REALITY!\n*****\nORIGINAL STORY:\nIn 1985, the animated series known as Robotech hit the airwaves in the United States and became an overnight sensation. Combining fast-paced giant robot action with some genuinely mature drama, it was a breath of fresh air for many children who had gotten tired of the usual cartoons on TV at the time. For many fans, it was their first exposure to Japanese anime, and is often credited with starting the anime industry in the US. It spawned over twenty novels, hundreds of comics, video games and dozens of home video releases all over the world.\nCarl Macek, the producer of Robotech, was recently working with Harmony Gold on Robotech: Academy. This new series set in the Robotech universe follows several new cadets in their adventures around the universe. We are reaching out to our fans to make this a reality!\n Robotech Academy occurs concurrently with the unfinished Sentinels storyline of the Robotech saga. By this time, the Earth has been ravaged by decades of interplanetary war. \nThe Robotech Expeditionary Force, commanded by Admiral Rick Hunter aboard the SDF-3, has departed for the homeward of the Robotech Masters, to draw the battle away from Earth. \nThe officers of the Expeditionary Force have placed their greatest treasures, their children, in the Robotech Academy. Based on a moon in orbit around Mars, the academy was created as a safe haven for these young cadets. \nHowever, as the Academy also functions as a research center for advanced Robotechnology, it becomes an inviting target. The story focuses on a fresh class of young characters, including child prodigy Wally, and the swashbuckling teen pilot Lindsay, who is an old rival and associate of Jack Baker. \nTheir lives are turned upside down when the Academy is attacked by alien fanatics who call themselves the Children of Zor, trying to reclaim the lost secrets of Robotechnology, which they believe to be rightfully theirs.  Unbeknownst to the new class, this treasure trove of Robotechnology just happens to be hidden right under everybody's noses throughout the Academy, in places such as the campus museum. \nIn an unexpected maneuver that saves the lives of the young student body, an experimental spacefold drive is activated, which suddenly transports the cadets away from the battle. \nHowever, they end up in an uncharted, distant region of the galaxy, and their supply of \"protoculture\" which is used to power the spacefold drive, is extremely limited. \nValuable clues to lead them out of their predicament have been left behind by none other than the originator of Robotechnology itself, Zor. They discover the path that Zor's ship once had taken before it eventually crashed on Planet Earth. This next generation of heroes must rise to the challenge, facing mysterious aliens and making difficult choices as they rely on their wits. They have to scavenge prototype mecha hidden across the campus and journey past a series of alien worlds to find their way back home, or at least rendezvous with the Robotech Expeditionary Force.\nAnd you'll also see familiar faces from the Robotech leadership, such as Rolf Emerson, Anatole Leonard, Doctor Lang, and... \nThe Robotech Academy Kickstarter will allow us to gauge how much of a new Robotech series we could actually produce based on Carl's original premise. We are setting our initial goal at $500,000 which will allow us to create an entire 24 minute pilot episode. This will help us cover character design, mecha design, 3D modeling, 3D animation, 2D animation, screenwriting, sound engineering, music composition, casting, voice acting and recording. This will also afford us a foundation on which to build future episodes.\nThanks to new technological advances, we're able to get our fans involved in ways Carl had only dreamed about before. Back in the 90's Carl Macek mused that the internet could be used to raise funds for new shows.

LeVar Burton here. You may know me as Kunta Kinte, from ROOTS, or Geordi La Forge, from Star Trek: The Next Generation. \nYou also may have grown up with me on Reading Rainbow. \nIt was my mother who taught me that, by picking up a book, I could \"go anywhere\" and \"be anything.\" Ever since Reading Rainbow began in 1983, I have dedicated myself to fostering a love of reading in children, just as my mother did for me. \nOver the past year, I have watched Kickstarter bring communities together to support artists and inventors. Again and again, I have been inspired by watching like-minded people team up to accomplish impossible dreams, and to change the world. \nNow, I am hoping you will join me on my mission: to bring Reading Rainbow back for every child, everywhere.\nTogether, we can change the lives of millions of children. But you don't have to take my word for it: just keep reading!\nI believe that every child has a right, and a need, to be literate. We have a responsibility to prepare our children\u2026 and right now, the numbers show that we, as a society, are failing in that responsibility.\nAnd here\u2019s the problem:\nAnd: numerous studies reveal that children who can't read at grade level by the 4th grade are 400% more likely to drop out of high school.\nAnd: as of 2011, America was the only free-market country where the current generation was less well educated than the one before.\nThese problems won't solve themselves.  Real change will require us all to work together. We cannot afford to lose generations of children to illiteracy. And if we work together, we don't have to.\nThrough Reading Rainbow, we've been working to solve these problems for over three decades. Starting in 1983, Reading Rainbow successfully used television to turn generations of kids into lifelong readers... with great results.\nOf course, when Reading Rainbow began in 1983, we were using television to bring books to kids, meeting them where they wanted to be. In 2014, TV is not that place anymore. Now, we\u2019re trying to reach a new generation of digital natives.\nThat\u2019s why, two years ago, I launched the Reading Rainbow App for tablets. Building on the basics of the television series, we put hundreds of quality books \u2013 and educational video field trips \u2013 right in a child\u2019s hands.\nThe response has been encouraging:\nBut despite this progress, there are big challenges left to face.\nFirst, not all families have access to tablets. Our goal is to cultivate a love of reading in all children, not just those that have tablets. To reach kids everywhere, we need to be everywhere: we need to be on the web, on mobile devices, on game consoles and on connected televisions. \nSecond, a resounding number of teachers have told me that they want Reading Rainbow in their classrooms, where they know it can make a difference. We will provide it, along with the tools that teachers need, including teacher guides, leveling, and dashboards. And with your help, we'll provide it to thousands of disadvantaged classrooms for FREE.\nEvery Home. Reading Rainbow\u2019s digital collection already contains hundreds of books and video field trips\u2026 but with your help, we\u2019ll be able to make the Reading Rainbow library available on more of the devices modern kids use to consume content. Now that we've met our initial goal of $1,000,000, we will be able to launch a new version of Reading Rainbow on the single most-used digital platform: the web. And now that we've reached our stretch goal of$5,000,000, we'll also be able to bring the service to mobile phones, Android, game consoles like XBOX and PlayStation, and set-top boxes like AppleTV and ROKU.\nEvery Classroom. Together, we want to provide Reading Rainbow to as many classrooms as possible FOR FREE! Now that we've reached our stretch goal of $5,000,000, we'll be able to provide year-long subscriptions in over 7,500 classrooms \u2013 and every additional $100K we raise lets us help 500 more!\nNo matter how much we raise, we promise that every dollar you pledge will bring Reading Rainbow to more platforms, and provide it for free in more classrooms.\nWe can make sure that millions of kids learn to love reading, but we can\u2019t do it without you. That's why I hope you\u2019ll join me in making a difference!\nI believe that spreading the love of reading is its own greatest reward. But if you're going to join our cause, we also have some wonderful prizes. But you don't have to take my word for it... Take a look!\nAside from the signed book, the rewards above will be available to anyone who pledges! \nBut we also have several LIMITED EDITION rewards... so be sure to get them before we run out! (And if we DO run out, keep checking back -- we'll do our best to add more when we can!)\nOr, if you prefer, you can also pledge for a reward package that will be gifted to the classroom or school of your choice!\nAnd, if you're just interested in Star Trek related rewards, and don't want all of the Reading Rainbow goodies above, we've also got a few special reward levels created just for you:\nThis Kickstarter \u2013 and Reading Rainbow \u2013 couldn't happen alone, so I want you to meet the full team behind our Kickstarter.\nEverytime I walk into the office, I am reminded that the Reading Rainbow team is made up of passionate, talented artists, producers, engineers, and so many more. Most of them grew up on the show, have families of their own now, and dedicate their working day to improving the lives of the next generation.  \nIt's an honor to be surrounded by my Reading Rainbow family every day, and we can't wait for you to join us.

Published by Sony, these games became legendary for their unique soundtracks, their snappy, frenetic action and the zen-like \"flow states\" that players entered into when they got into the groove. \nOriginal game screen and box cover art. The Amplitude logo is a trademark of Sony Computer Entertainment America LLC.\nBoth fans and reviewers REALLY liked the game. Some select quotes from back in the day:\nIn the 11 years since Amplitude\u2019s release, Harmonix has gone on to create true pop culture phenomena with the original Guitar Hero, Rock Band, and Dance Central. Still, there was a quiet clawing in the back of our minds. Pleas from Amplitude fans, strangers on the street, and veterans of the studio - we needed to revisit this era of gaming and update it for the modern age! \nWith the advancements in technology and the huge creative leaps forward our studio has taken, we believe we can rebuild Amplitude for current consoles and make it an even more amazing experience than before. We're aiming to deliver an updated soundtrack, incredible visuals, and fine-tuned controls. These improvements will be layered on top of the core mechanics and hallmark difficulty that made both FreQuency and Amplitude such amazing experiences when they first debuted. We\u2019re confident that we can make a game that will do its predecessors justice!\n\n  Early Crippler concept - Purple player launched a debilitating power-up on the green player.\nDuring Rock Band, we perfected our methodology for \u201cbeatmatching\u201d, which we intend to apply to this new title. We\u2019ll also be moving the game into the new proprietary engine Harmonix has developed over the past 10 years. In addition to better control over timing windows, this will also allow us to run at 60 frames per second and smoothly port the existing mechanics to PS3 and PS4.\nThe game, as designed for this Kickstarter, focuses on the core Amplitude experience. Single player and local multiplayer are included in the design, as are leaderboards for online bragging rights. The Beat Blaster (the ship), music notes, tracks and FX will all be modernized and gorgeous. The cyberworld around the tracks will be designed by artists and crafted by coders so that every pixel on screen can be driven by the underlying music. Even as we work through our plans for this Kickstarter, the game is beginning to take shape \u2013 an HD reinvisioning of the cult classic, smartly updated for today on every axis. We believe this is the game that fans of Amplitude have been asking for and a game that can only come from Harmonix.\nEarly Beat Blaster concepts\nMusic is at the heart of Amplitude. The all-new soundtrack will focus on songs with an electronic-based feel, with tones spanning dark and moody to bright and bouncing. \nOur award-winning audio team is uniquely capable of composing amazing music with ideal GAMEPLAY in mind. All the amazing patterns and runs that made Amplitude's gameplay so fun need sick music crafted to match perfectly. For this game, we plan to focus our efforts on music that is custom-created for the game. This has the best chance of creating KILLER gameplay feel and a well-balanced list of songs. And you can help us pick which tracks make it into the final shipping tracklist! Take a look at our backer rewards for more details on how you can make your voice heard, contribute tracks to the game, or get your hands on a limited edition vinyl soundtrack!\nLimited edition colored vinyl (mockup)\nAt its higher difficulty levels, Amplitude was hard as hell. We\u2019re talking \u201cDark Souls\u201d hard, but with music. We know that fans of the original will be expecting that same level of challenge in this new version, and we won\u2019t disappoint. The game will still feature its hallmark difficulty as you progress.\nIn the years since Amplitude, Harmonix developers have become masters at making rhythm games fun for everybody. While we\u2019re focused on designing this project to appeal to a \u201chardcore\u201d base, we intend for fans of more recent Harmonix products to feel right at home with this new game as well, if they\u2019re willing to put in the practice and hone their skills!\nOriginal Amplitude team members still rocking it at Harmonix\nMany of the original developers who made this game a classic are still here at Harmonix, and psyched to update the experience for all players.\nThese veteran developers will be joined by the best rhythm game devs in the industry, folks who\u2019ve shipped dozens of AAA titles. We\u2019re ready to deliver a one-of-a-kind experience that players can pick up and enjoy. This is a game only Harmonix can make, on time and on budget. But we know that we can't do it without your help.\nThe levels are dark and quiet on entry, but jump to life as players release the musical notes.\nOur aim with this Kickstarter is to be humble in our expectations. The current goal is to make a faithful Amplitude \"HD\" - the core experience from PS2\u00ae re-developed for modern gaming devices. We certainly have LOTS of crazy ideas that could blow this concept out. Your contribution, feedback, and community input will decide where this project will land and how many crazy ideas we can incorporate!\nEarly Beat Blaster sketches\nThis project is intended to be a love letter to old-school PS2\u00ae fans, but we need to know that this is something you actually want. This is the project WE desperately want to make, but we can\u2019t do it without your interest and support. Help us prove that there is a place for challenging, high-polished rhythm-action games in the modern age!\nTiers (Updated 5.20.14)\nReward Grid (Updated 5.20.14)", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nNEW PLATFORMS!\n\nWe haven't shipped a game on PlayStation\u00ae4. New platforms always come with some minor learning curves, BUT we have great producers and partners at Sony and we're confident we'll be able to overcome any obstacles\n\nTIMELINE AND TECHNOLOGY ROADMAP:\n\nThere are technical limitations to overcome in order to get the game running at 60 fps (a requirement to make all musical timing feel snappy). We have a strong plan about how to adapt our proprietary engine for these purposes, especially on PS4, but it is a risk.\n\n\nMUSIC LICENSING AND SOUNDTRACK COMPOSITION\n\nWe want to have the right balance between great electronic songs you know and the type of amazing original compositional work we did in the original PS2\u00ae games. This creative work can take time, become more costly than expected, and generally turn into a headache. That said, we have a LOT of experience in this area and we're confident we can make it work.

Determined to become a witch just like Shiny Chariot, Akko enrolls in the prestigious witch academy, Luna Nova. Contrary to her expectations, the classes are unexpectedly boring. Akko struggles to keep herself in high hopes and spirits, but the reaction from her peers remain indifferent. In the previous episode, Akko became the school\u2019s hero by slaying the dragon that appeared from the underground dungeon, but her fame is short-lived.

Anything to everything.\nThe Internet of Things is about you. Your things, your data. You should be in control. This is only possible with a completely open platform - hardware, software, protocols.\nBig ideas need powerful technology. Hardware is a good start, but it isn\u2019t enough. Connecting all the things requires a complete system designed from the ground up to interoperate seamlessly.\nWhat We've Done\nWe created an OS to handle wireless communications so you don\u2019t have to. Wireless can be simple, until you want features like security, multi-hop routing, and automatic power management. You can cut corners on some projects, but what happens when you\u2019re controlling your door locks or have a network of two dozen battery powered sensors?\nWe made it low power so you don\u2019t have to change the batteries all the time. A sensor in your door doesn't need a big processor and a high power WiFi radio, capable of streaming HD video, to tell you the door is \u201copen\u201d or \u201cclosed\u201d. It does need to minimize power usage - frequently changing batteries on dozens of devices in hard to reach places isn\u2019t something you want to do. We keep power consumption as low as we can by using a low power microcontroller and radio, and implementing novel wireless communication techniques that we haven\u2019t seen anywhere else!\nWe implemented more layers of security to keep your system safer. Security is critical on a wireless network, particularly when it comes to safety systems. The Sapphire wireless protocol uses AES encryption to keep your data private, but doesn\u2019t stop there. We have built in authentication and replay protection, to keep rogue devices from joining the network or sending forged messages.\nWe synchronize time across every device in the network. Every node synchronizes its clock to the rest of the network to within a few milliseconds. In addition to being critical to our power management scheme, tight time synchronization is also incredibly useful when coordinating actions or sensor readings across multiple devices.\nWe created a software framework so all of your devices, Sapphire or otherwise, can communicate with each other. Connect with Python, REST, or extend the system with your own API. Every part of our system is network aware, meaning data is shared transparently between machines and devices - no complex network programming needed.\nWe designed hardware to get you started. Hardware is hard, especially once you put a radio on it. Our hardware is designed to be easy to use, but powerful enough to support a comprehensive operating system.\nWe made it open, so you can own everything. Our entire platform is open source and designed to run locally on your network. No cloud service, no subscriptions, nothing is outside of your control. Of course, the Sapphire network can still connect to the Internet, at your discretion.\nOpen Source Hardware, Open Source Initiative, Creative Commons\nWe made a mesh network, which you didn\u2019t even realize you wanted! Sapphire\u2019s wireless technology seamlessly routes messages across multiple devices to reach their final destination. Need to cover some serious distance? Just add another Sapphire device in between and let our technology handle the rest. Want to build a huge network? Sapphire is designed to scale from dozens to hundreds of devices.\nWe made a mesh!\nWe actually built things. It works. Touting design goals and features is one thing. Actually putting them to the test is another. We\u2019ve taken our prototype hardware and created networks of over 20 nodes, limited only by the amount of hardware we\u2019ve built. We've connected motion sensors to lights, temperature and light sensors to cloud data-logging, a receipt printer to Twitter, a smoke detector to text and email, weather forecasts to LED displays, and 16 custom LED light bars to an iPad app for outdoor dance parties. As we have time, we will be sharing the designs. Check out the videos throughout the page to see these in action!\nWe\u2019ve done a lot, but Sapphire is about enabling you. Sapphire is for anyone who wants to focus on their own talents, rather than the wireless portion of a project. The platform is designed with professional quality features, without sacrificing ease of use. A basic introduction to C, Python, and electronics is all you need to get your application online.\nHardware\nOur hardware platform is a microcontroller development board, centered on the venerable Atmel AVR microcontroller, and sports a built in 2.4 GHz radio. We designed in a wide range power supply, USB debug port, and enough IO to do pretty much anything you can imagine. We even threw in one megabyte of flash memory for data storage, firmware upgrades, and system logging. There are a couple of shields available to help get you started out of the box.\nHeader connectors (not pictured) will be on all shipping Blue Sapphires. Also, they will be blue :)\nRange: The range between two nodes is comparable to WiFi -- up to 100 feet indoors and 300 feet outdoors. With multi-hop technology, Sapphire extends your network coverage as you add more devices by bridging new nodes, even if they can\u2019t reach the gateway directly.\nPower supply: The Blue Sapphire has a number of flexible power options:\nThe barrel jack accepts 4 to 16 volts DC, which makes it easy to find a wall wart or battery power source that will work.  \nThe mini USB connector can also be used to supply 5 volts DC power.\nThe regulated and unregulated power nets are exposed to the shield headers, allowing the Blue Sapphire to power the shield OR the shield to power the Blue Sapphire.\nPower and ground pads are exposed for soldering wires to a power source.\nPower consumption: Power consumption is heavily dependent on application, specifically how much time the device spends sleeping, and how much time it spends on and communicating wirelessly. The CPU and radio use around 1000 times more power when on than asleep, so the operating system is designed to minimize on time as much as possible. We\u2019re continually optimizing and testing our power control software, and by using a unique combination of techniques we have made a lot of advances. Here are some preliminary numbers:\nSleep current: 25 uA\nCPU + Radio on current: 20 mA\nOn time duty cycle: 0.2% and lower\n\nOperating System\nThe OS is what sets Sapphire apart from everything else. It runs on Blue Sapphire hardware, making complex wireless networking tasks easy. It implements all of the features necessary for a reliable and successful mesh network, while leaving plenty of system resources available for application software.\nHere\u2019s a few things you don\u2019t have to do:\nServer and Automation Framework\nOur server framework links everything together on the application level. Sapphire devices are automatically discovered and connected to the server. Python and REST APIs are exposed for easy scripting. The server itself is highly modular and extensible. In fact, each component is capable of running on a separate machine on your network. To make getting started as easy as possible, we\u2019re putting together a downloadable virtual machine with everything you need pre-configured.\nPython API\nREST API\nBuilt on Redis - APIs can be added in any language with a Redis client. See the list of Redis clients here.\nModular - different components can run on different machines on the network.\nAutomatic Sapphire device discovery.\nLight weight - we run many of our demos on a Raspberry Pi.\n\nExample setup with Raspberry Pi running automation scripts.\n\nKey-Value System\nSapphire's key-value system simplifies data sharing between devices and the outside world. Key-value pairs declared in firmware are automatically published to the network for read/write access. Push time-stamped notifications of changed values with a single function call. Optional persistence preserves values across reboots. Sapphire handles the network \u2014 just set and forget.\nIt\u2019s open source!\nHow open source? All of it.\nHardware: https://github.com/sapphireos/sapphire-hardware\nOperating system (coming soon): https://github.com/sapphireos/sapphire-os\nServer & Tools: https://github.com/sapphireos/sapphire-tools\nDemos and examples: https://github.com/sapphireos/sapphire-apps\nWe\u2019re working hard on more demos and examples, along with polishing up some features and enhancements. We will have complete API docs and design guides by the time we ship hardware. Interested in collaborating, or want to know more? Drop us a line!\nSnazzy shirt and stickers!\nHow will your money be spent? \n\nThere\u2019s a lot that goes into making a hardware product. Because we want this project to be about a community of developers, not just a company with a product, we are asking for your help to truly crowdfund Sapphire. We have stayed away from angel, venture capitalist, and incubator funding to get this project started the right way.\nHere\u2019s a list of all of the things we have to account for in our budget:\nElectrical components\nBoard assembly labor\nFCC certification (this alone is approximately $10,000)\nProduction tooling (SMT programming, PCB phototools, test fixtures, etc)\nPackaging, shipping, handling\nLegal fees (you cannot escape the lawyers!)\nTexas sales tax (only for Texas backers)\nKickstarter and Amazon fees (this is 8%!)\nJust-in-case (FCC certification failure/retest, manufacturing issues/fallout, etc.)\nWhat\u2019s our timeline?\nShown above is our critical path to production. Some of these things have variable timelines.\nPrototype production run: 6 weeks\nFCC certification: 4 to 8 weeks\nProduction run: 6 weeks minimum\nComponents procurement: This one is trickier, since the market can be very unpredictable, especially at the low production volumes we're starting with. Our entire lead time is defined by the slowest part. Ranges from one week to three months.\nA lot of the timing is dependent on component availability or the scheduling constraints of our test lab and manufacturing partner. We\u2019ve set our shipping goal as a reasonable estimate based on these considerations and our experience. We will communicate scheduling updates as we move forward through the project.\nWho are we?\nJeremy Billheimer @jbillhei - Chief Engineer. Jeremy\u2019s industry and design experience spans telemetry and control systems design for race cars, FAA certified flight software, high speed PCB design, 3D electromagnetic signal integrity simulation, and technical/customer support. Within Sapphire, Jeremy works on hardware and software design, marketing, and business management. In his free time, he enjoys building LED lighting systems for outdoor dance parties, partner dancing (often at said outdoor dance parties), and riding his motorcycle through the hill country.\nBrian Anschutz @banschu - Electrical Engineer. Brian\u2019s experience is in the scientific instrumentation electronics industry, focused primarily on hardware design with the latest technologies in high speed digital devices and radio frequency communications (enabling 802.11ac, passive radar, Li-Fi, etc.). His professional experience also includes electronics manufacturing test, NIST traceable calibration, getting yelled at on the phone, moving pallets around, and painting houses. He likes most electrons, music, outdoors, beer, and volleyball.\nChris Pond @ponddesign - Interface Designer. The man behind the camera. An enigma, little is known about Chris. It is rumored he haunts coffee shops by day and makes digital content look amazing. By night, he can found riding through the mists of time, or synthesizing auditory hallucinations.\nGet in touch!\nWe\u2019d love to hear from you! Here are the best ways to contact us:\nCommunity Forums http://community.sapphireos.com/ We encourage you to direct your questions to our forums rather than Kickstarter\u2019s, as we\u2019d like to have the forum threads available for future Sapphire users.\nTwitter http://twitter.com/SapphireOS\nFacebook https://www.facebook.com/sapphireopensystems\nEmail info@sapphireos.com", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have an experienced team, so we know that creating a project of this scope is challenging. Here are the biggest risks we face, and what we\u2019re doing to minimize their impact.\n\nFCC certification\nThis is probably the riskiest challenge. FCC testing is expensive, costing around $10,000. Electromagnetic emissions can be difficult to predict, and the fact that we are certifying a radio transmitter adds to the complexity. However, we have a lot of experience with proper circuit and board design techniques to minimize possible electromagnetic emissions issues. The radio component is designed specifically to comply with FCC requirements and our maximum transmit power is far below the lawful maximum. Our hardware design is finished and ready for certification, so we\u2019ll be able to begin the process with no delay if we reach our funding goal. \n\nSupply chain and logistics\nThis is a big problem for small startups like us. We\u2019re producing low quantities (as far as the electronics industry is concerned), so we don\u2019t have much in the way of buying power with component suppliers. Most of our buying will be done through distributors and we are often at the mercy of what they have in stock. We\u2019re not going it alone though. We have an experienced manufacturing partner right here in Austin, and we\u2019re able to leverage their connections and much larger buying power to help minimize the possibility of being unable to obtain parts in a timely manner. We are also working on managing expectations by making sure our early supporters receive their boards first. We are fairly confident on our turnaround time for the first thousand boards, but obtaining higher quantities beyond that may impose additional delays, so we may split production into more than one batch. And as always we will keep you posted!\n\nHardware design problems\nOf course with hardware there is always the risk that there will be design problems. Our design has gone through around a dozen revisions spanning several years of development, and many of our prototypes have been in use continuously for over 18 months. We think we\u2019ve covered all of our bases, but if you\u2019d like to review the design, all of our schematics and board layouts are available on Github: https://github.com/sapphireos/sapphire-hardware. Please participate in the public discussion about our hardware in our Discussion Forums: http://community.sapphireos.com/\n\nSoftware issues\nThere is always the possibility of bugs and unexpected corner cases with software. Sapphire is a complex project, comprising around 14,000 lines for the operating system and around 6,000 lines for the server and tool chains. This may sound like a lot, but our lead software engineer has 10 years of experience in embedded software, including experience designing and certifying flight software. Many of the core components of Sapphire have been in use for years and are the results of extensive testing and field use. Our biggest risk is the low power network management software, which is relatively new. However, its design is based on extensive field experience with wireless mesh networks, and is heavily optimized for Sapphire as a complete system. Finally, like our hardware, all of the source code is available on Github https://github.com/sapphireos .

The story focuses on the group\u2019s thief, Leara, and the murderer, T.A., who possess mysterious powers that make them the prime target of hunters, rebels, and the government.\nThey all set out on a journey together to find a rumored paradise as they rob, murder, kidnap, fight bounty hunters, and avoid being captured by the government.\nIf they don\u2019t end up killing each other, they may just find a way to paradise.\nSTYLE\n\"The action scenes are filled with quirky side jokes and goofs.

With all of the depth in a character and funny moments making you feel safe, It's the sudden eruption of butt whoopings that wake you up.... The best part of waking up is \"the whoopings of the butt\". The fight scenes are cleverly unorthodox. The humor is dry and quirky.

(Both volume 1 and volume 2) We want to be able to order at least 200 books ready for this year, but if we can make it 1000 copies, VOLUME 3 and 4 of VU will be next for a debut. A stretch goal is to have volumes 1,2,3&4 made into one hardcover book. THAT WOULD ROCK!\nWHERE DOES FUNDING GO?\nI do need to stay alive and fed while i'm getting the book finished. Funding will cover the artists, Lazymills and her assistants, as they work on the comic as well as the preparations for the years comic conventions. It will cover the cost of printing, shipping, and polishing the books. It will cover the cost of ads, banners, convention booths, displays, website space; VU merchandise will also be covered to further build onto the VU world. T-shirts, buttons, posters, and funny shorts that will be posted on the ViolatorUnion Youtube channel for free viewing. the stretch goal is to do a full length animation.\npanel lines from VU pages\nnew poster lines!\nNewest VU Image ready for you to take home and put on your walls.

Currently, I am the only artist able to work on both line art and writing for the comic but the goal is to have the pages in full color. For that, I've got one the best colorists I could ask for standing by. If the campaign fails, it will be tough to do it without him polishing it up all pretty like. On top of that, is the plans of taking the books to conventions for it's debut. It would be our goal to have the book completed in time for this, but also to have enough to have shops keep a number of for sale. \n\nThe biggest risk, however, is that I may need to divide my time between work and the pages. If that is ever the case, there will be a shift on to another artist who will work their magic as i direct.

Who\u2019s leaving the clues? How do they know her secret, and what do they want from her?\nFind out what the fate of Erica's brother is in the exciting first episode entitled: The Hangman.Get Erica's power under control as you go face to face against a dark serial killer as Erica risks her own life to uncover the mystery behind The Hangman!\nDeveloped by a true \u201cindie dream team\u201d, the line-up includes comics artist Romano Molenaar (Batman, Witchblade, Tomb Raider, X-Men) as Art Director and renowned adventure game designer Jane Jensen (Gabriel Knight, Gray Matter, and the upcoming Moebius) lending her expertise as Story Consultant.\nWho We Are\nIn September of 2012, we hosted the first ever Boston Festival of Indie Games. We have come to Kickstarter to help make the next BostonFIG bigger and better than anyone could imagine.\nWe are game developers in the Greater Boston Area who had the crazy notion to run our very own celebration of independent game development, which became the Boston Festival of Indie Games. We\u2019re made up of an eclectic group of game designers, programmers, entrepreneurs, and media specialists; but we share one thing in common: we love games. We wanted to bring that love of games to the public and create a free-to-attend event where people could not only play games, but learn about the games that were being made in their backyard.\nHistory of BostonFIG\nTalks of forming BostonFIG began around the announcement of finalists for 2012\u2019s Independent Games Festival. We wondered why the East Coast didn\u2019t have an IGF equivalent, one that was cheap (or free) to attend, had a low barrier to entry and transparency in the curation process. Then, we decided, who better to do it but us? So we put our thinking caps on, built our team, and got to work. In under six months, we had built a festival from the ground up which included 50 games, 5 movies, 2 speakers, an art gallery, an awards show, a sponsored game jam, and 2000 attendees!\nFixing the Problems\nTrying to cram 2,000 people into a handful of classrooms turned out to be problematic. The festival was a lot of fun, but it was cramped and hot. This was the number one issue we heard from attendees, so we\u2019ve vowed to resolve it for BostonFIG 2013. In order to do so, we\u2019ve booked much bigger, more centralized spaces at MIT. MIT\u2019s Stratton Student Center and Johnson Athletic Center will better accommodate the crowds, exhibitors and game developers at Boston Festival of Indie Games. Our goal is to have plenty of room for all the great features that come with the festival, like the game developer showcase, tabletop game play, art gallery, game jam, keynote speakers, films and much more.\nMaking BostonFIG Bigger and Better\nThe success of our inaugural festival put us in a great position to expand BostonFIG in 2013. We are adding quite a bit of new fest content, such as live game music, tournaments, outdoor games and a children\u2019s game room. We will be showing new movies and bringing back crowd favorites from last year. Everything at the festival will be within the same concentrated area, so no one misses out on our Game Art Gallery or Tabletop Game Room. We are making sure there is food service close by so no one goes hungry. We will have more talks and workshops that bring educational value to the festival. Most importantly, we will have the space necessary to host not only more games, but also more attendees, with a lot more room to walk around and have a great time!\nWhat\u2019s Changing\nOne thing we can guarantee will not change is that general admission will still BE FREE! Of course, we are keeping the video games, board games, LARPs, street games, game jam, movies, art gallery, talks, the Figgies Awards Show, and all the other great content that made Boston Festival of Indie Games such a big hit last year. But we will also be adding lots more content, access to food services and even more games in a much bigger space! We can only make this happen with your help.\nSpending Funds\nHosting this kind of event is not cheap. To grow in response to the needs of our audience, our costs for 2013 have increased. Funds being raised will help underwrite the costs of larger event spaces booked at MIT, more equipment, supplies, tables and chairs needed to exhibit our game developers and partners, increased requirement for on-site security, additional on-site signage, printed programs and registration badges, covering travel expenses for featured keynote speakers, and numerous other hard costs associated with running a festival. We maintain our commitment as an all-volunteer workforce and festival staff, so no funds are being used to pay staff or consultants.\nThe Figgie Bundle\nFeel like getting some games for backing the BostonFIG Kickstarter? Of course you do! Introducing the Figgie Bundle, a whole bunch of games we\u2019ve put together for your enjoyment.

Every artist made their own interpretation as to what the Black Torch was. It could be the title of their story, a physical object, or the name of a character.

New gameplay footage!\nUpdate #20: GameSpot reveals The Longest Journey Home!\nClick here for MORE updates!\nDreamfall Chapters: The Longest Journey is a 3D adventure game for Mac, Linux and Windows PC that takes the player on an epic journey across the twin worlds of Stark and Arcadia; from a futuristic cyberpunk vision of our world, to a realm of powerful magic and dangerous beauty.\nWith Dreamfall Chapters, we will finally continue the darkly magical story that began in the critically acclaimed and award-winning adventures The Longest Journey and Dreamfall: The Longest Journey.\nIndependently developed by Red Thread Games, this project brings back the core team behind Dreamfall, including Ragnar T\u00f8rnquist, creator of The Longest Journey saga.\nThe world of Arcadia exists in parallel and balance with ours. It is a world of magic and chaos, a counterweight to Stark, the world of science and order. The Balance between the twin worlds is watched over by the Guardian, who channels the energies of Chaos and Order between Arcadia and Stark.\nSome people are able to move freely between worlds. These very special individuals are called Shifters. There are not many left, and those who can Shift keep it a secret to the world.\nSome people can travel in a different way, dreaming themselves into other worlds, existing in two places at once. They are called Dreamers.\nAt this point, there is only one known Dreamer in the twin worlds: Zo\u00eb Castillo.\nDreamfall Chapters concludes the Dreamer Cycle and the gripping story of Zo\u00eb, the Dreamer.\nRevisiting familiar locations and characters, and introducing new sights and sounds, new faces, new game mechanics, new thrills and challenges, Dreamfall Chapters takes players on an epic journey -- from the dystopian cyberpunk future of Stark, through the mysterious and dreamlike Storytime, to the magical landscapes of Arcadia.\nDreamfall Chapters is a game made for both fans of the saga and new players who are looking for an adventure unlike any other: one that crosses the divide between two completely different and original worlds.\nWith this latest game in the saga, we will recapture the heart and soul of The Longest Journey and improve on the immersion and game mechanics of Dreamfall in order to bring you a fitting, satisfying and emotional conclusion to the Dreamer Cycle.\nExperience a deep and complex storyline that continues the epic saga of The Longest Journey\nExplore a beautiful, rich, detailed, interactive and living world that mixes a cyberpunk vision of the future with magical fantasy, along with a broken and decaying dreamworld\nPlay as three different characters, all on journeys across worlds, through life, and into their own hearts and souls\n3D point-and-click interface and engaging adventure gameplay\nAfter more than six years, we're excited and grateful for the chance to make a sequel to Dreamfall: The Longest Journey! It's been our dream to tell more stories in The Longest Journey universe, and we've brought back the core team behind the saga for this long-awaited sequel.\nThe previous games in the series were made by Funcom but now Red Thread Games has licensed the rights to the saga. We are producing and funding the game ourselves, without the support of a publisher.\nWe are therefore asking for your help to fund the project and to finally make our dream a reality!\nACHIEVED!

There are massive spoilers ahead.\nWe will release an interactive graphic novel, retelling the story so far, prior to Dreamfall Chapters. There will also be a comprehensive in-game recap, and the game has been designed to introduce new players to the characters and story.\nZo\u00eb Castillo (in-game screenshot)\nThe Undreaming is Unchained.\nThe last time we met Zo\u00eb Castillo, the Dreamer, she was in a deep coma. She had saved the world from the ghost in the machine that had taken residence in the ethereal realm of the Winter, but in the end Zo\u00eb was betrayed and left for dead. Her body is now in a hospital in Casablanca.\nHer mind, however, is elsewhere.\nTrapped inside the mysterious Storytime, Zo\u00eb must learn to control her dreams and confront the past before she can resume her life.\nIn Arcadia, we witnessed April Ryan, the Shifter, mortally wounded by one of the Azadi, foreign invaders of the Northlands. Kian Alvane, an assassin working for the rulers of the Azadi nation, has been sentenced to death for treason. He awaits execution in the prison tower of Friar's Keep.\nIn our world, Stark, the shadowy corporation WatiCorp has released the Dreamer. Half the world is hooked up to the dream machine, and society is crumbling. And in Marcuria, the Azadi are cementing their power once more, while their mystical tower continues to harvest dreams.\nUnless something is done, unless our heroes can awake and be reborn, the future is bleak. What is WatiCorp planning? Who is the Prophet? How are the Azadi involved?\nThe answers to those questions will be found in Dreamfall Chapters.\nPlenty of familiar faces will return, along with many of the original voice actors from both The Longest Journey and Dreamfall.\nPlayers will experience the story through the eyes of three different characters as their unique paths and separate plots intersect.\nThe central character of our story is Zo\u00eb Castillo, a twenty-one year old girl who saved the world in Dreamfall before falling into a deep coma over a year ago.\nPlayers will once again play as Zo\u00eb as she learns to use her emerging talents, escapes the Storytime, travels to Europolis and eventually crosses the Divide into the magical world of Arcadia.\nZo\u00eb (actual in-game model)\nThe second playable character in the game is Kian Alvane. We will have more information on this character soon, on our official website.\nIn-game real-time screenshot of Kian Alvane\nMany favourite characters will also return, including Crow, sidekick extraordinaire; Blind Bob, the not-so-blind beggar; Benrime Salmin, innkeeper of the Journeyman Inn and member of the resistance; Roper Klacks, author of 'Farewell to my Wizardin' Days'; the enigmatic Vagabond; the equally enigmatic Brian Westhouse; April's old friend Emma; and Zo\u00eb's ex-boyfriend Reza Temiz, whose identity was left in doubt at the end of Dreamfall -- and more!\nAnd, of course, players will learn the destiny of April Ryan, and see the continuation of her storyline. From unlikely heroine to haunted rebel, April's life is central to The Longest Journey saga, and we will answer the question that has haunted everyone:\nIs April Ryan dead?\nStark is a cyberpunk vision of future Earth. Having suffered a setback with the mysterious Collapse in 2209, society was on the rebound when Dreamfall began.\nIt's now 2220, and WatiCorp's Dreamer has been released. Society is slowly crumbling as billions find themselves hopelessly addicted to lucid dreams. Linked up to the dangerous machines at home and in opium den-like Dream Factories, they escape reality by dreaming themselves into oblivion.\nArcadia is a magical mirror to our world; a realm where science and logic are replaced with magic and chaos. It is a wondrous world of strange species and grand cities, of epic armies and vast, unexplored landscapes.\nZo\u00eb meets a Tree Spirit in Dreamfall Chapters\nFrom the Northlands and its capital, Marcuria -- now occupied by the Azadi army -- and the distant Southlands, where the Iron Court rules over a dangerous and wild continent, to the mysterious west, where the Azadi nation have built their powerful empire, Dreamfall Chapters opens this magical world even more.\nAutumnal Marcuria, from Dreamfall Chapters (in-game screenshot)\nAnd finally there is Storytime, the place where every story begins, and where dreams come to life...\nThe Storytime in Dreamfall Chapters\nDreamfall Chapters is a 3D adventure game featuring a combination point-and-click and direct control interface. For a look at our prototype, check out this video:\nSunset in Shady Quay (real-time, in-game screenshot from Dreamfall Chapters)\nWe are combining the best parts of The Longest Journey and Dreamfall to create what we hope will be another classic adventure; a game filled with mature dialogue and challenging puzzles, exciting exploration, complex and fun characters, thrilling plot twists and an engaging and emotional story.\nDreamfall Chapters will have the magic, heart and soul, and the lush, interactive environments of The Longest Journey, filled with things to look at and explore. It will have an interface that harkens back to traditional point-and-click adventures. It will have the detailed 3D worlds of Dreamfall, where players can lose themselves in expansive locations and living environments, along with puzzles and challenges that are completely plot-driven and an integral part of the game's narrative.\nWe've brought back the core team members from Dreamfall: The Longest Journey to make Dreamfall Chapters, including award-winning writer and designer Ragnar T\u00f8rnquist, creator of The Longest Journey saga; Dag Scheve, co-writer of Dreamfall; and Christer Sveen, art director on Dreamfall.\nJoining the team are lead designer Martin Bruusgaard (Age of Conan, The Secret World), technical directors Kjetil Hjeldnes (The Longest Journey, Dreamfall, The Secret World) and Eigil Jarl Halse (Dreamfall, The Secret World), artist Sigbj\u00f8rn Gal\u00e5en (Dreamfall, Age of Conan, The Secret World), producer Rakel Johnsen (Age of Conan, The Secret World), and programmers Quintin Pan (Age of Conan, The Secret World) and Audun T\u00f8rnquist (The Longest Journey).\nThe Dreamfall Chapters team is highly experienced, talented and passionate, and we know, respect and love The Longest Journey universe. We're all excited to finally be able to continue telling the story we began way back in 1999.\nRed Thread Games is an independent developer.

Our team has extensive experience making games -- from titles such as The Longest Journey and Dreamfall, The Secret World and Age of Conan, Anarchy Online and many others.\n\nWe have invested a lot of our own money in Red Thread Games and Dreamfall Chapters, and we have also been lucky enough to receive a $175,000 grant from the Norwegian Film Institute to make a prototype. Without this money, we wouldn't be where we are today. It has allowed us to create a playable prototype, featuring several locations, characters, and a working GUI and control system.\n\nWe have also joined forces with Blink Studios, the talented team behind the upcoming action-RPG Skar: The Hammer Returns, to ensure that we have some of the best artists in the business working on the game.\n\nWe started development on a prototype several months ago, in order to be able to make some key design decisions and to reality-check our ideas and ambitions. We're using the Unity engine in order to reduce technical risks, and we're making good progress -- but game development is, of course, not an exact science.

Smart-draw with ground tiles, ladders, bridges, switches, and more (it nicens the edges for you), then populate your world with NPCs and enemies and objects and dangers, then hook them all up with an easy-to-use Place 'n' Fiddle interface! \n(For the brave, ADVANCED MODE opens up even more power -- See Tech Talkin' at the end.) But you can literally make a fun new level in MINUTES! And make it ANYWHERE you are!\nBut Tom is both excited about the new Game and the new content he will get to play. \u201cI am so excited to get back to my crazy kinda sci-fi universe,\u201d says Tom. \u201cI wander off, but they keep pulling me back in! Heh. But seriously, once the community grows, we can all play each other's fun levels and worlds in this universe. It's like us all getting hundreds of games for free!\"\nIt\u2019s a game company dedicated to making fun games, and then giving YOU the tools and the parts of the game -- the literal \u201cpieces of fun\u201d -- to play with!\nTom Hall is the award-winning designer of the Commander Keen series, Wolfenstein 3D, Spear of Destiny, DOOM, Rise of the Triad, Anachronox, Hyperspace Delivery Boy, Congo Cube, and Pettington Park. His game designing career spans over 25 years! Pieces of Fun is his new venture to not only make games but to let EVERYONE make games!  \n\nJoining Tom for this venture is Chris Burke, 30-year coding veteran, lead programmer on over a dozen titles, including Hellgate, The Sims 3: Life Moments, Ghost Recon Commander, and ports on numerous platforms, including Mortal Kombat and Sinistar, lending to his cross-platform skills. He joins Tom for a new era of cross-platform gaming and game creation! Along with stellar artists, they are going to let everyone play with and create new experiences with customizable Pieces of Fun!\nTom really wanted to get back to making a traditional platformer and we both wanted to make a fun game and creation environment across as many platforms as we found feasible. And as this is a project to both make a game AND a community, we thought it would be great to come to the community to start it up! And with your pledge, when we start you\u2019ll get to play the game as early as possible, providing feedback and voting on the next feature or world theme! This is the start of not just a little game and editor, but hopefully a new era of empowered creators!\nMP3s made it so anyone can make and share music easily.  Digital cameras took an arcane art and made it so anyone can make and share images easily.\nIt\u2019s time to do that for games. \nEveryone should be able to make a little game they can call their own and share with friends. You shouldn\u2019t have to worry about all the drudgery. It should be as simple as possible!  So we have an in-game editor that just lets you draw ground, plop stuff down, and adjust things right in the level! And if you want to dig deeper, we have Advanced Mode.  Or load in someone else\u2019s level and see what they did! There have been platform game editors on some platforms, and game-making tools across many platforms. Noble, awesome efforts all. But it's time to make things super simple, like digital photography. Everywhere, because ideas can just come to you at any time, and your editor should be right there, ready for you to create and play.\nThis is about all of us making a cool galaxy of game worlds together, and in this era of hyper-profits and safe bets, it can be hard to sell the idea of a community of free game world players and makers. So that\u2019s why we need you!\nWe need to raise at least $400K for our team to get this game creator and game completed. This isn\u2019t just a spiritual successor to Keen -- it\u2019s an editor and game content-sharing community  -- so that means servers, community support, lots of art and design and programming! \nThe game design means each planet has a new art style, and thus supports a new looks for new kinds of content, and includes cool new things to use in levels, in whatever art style! So stretch goals add content, functionality and more. And early on is the Box 2D stretch goal, adding cool physics puzzles into the mix! Let's make this thing as cool as possible, together!\nFor international pledges and generous donors, please visit www.worldsofwander.com for paying through PayPal. Thanks!\nThe more money we get, the more features unlock! \nFeatures like New Art Styles, New Content, New Planets, Box 2D physics support, and more!\nWe're excited to see how far we can go together!\nThere are a lot of cool rewards, and you get more as you go! Check 'em out on the right side of the screen. Just a few of them are:\nGame Box! T-Shirt! A BOOK!\nSo if you want something cool like WORLDS OF WANDER to exist, if you want a new game in the spirit of Keen, but something we can all play and make games in, then please support our Kickstarter. It means a lot to us. We truly want to open games up for everyone. THIS IS JUST THE BEGINNING!\nThe game engine is a side-scrolling platform engine, with three layers of parallax -- so the background scrolls with beautiful depth behind the game!\nWe are using Unity for cross-platform development. Thanks to the power of Unity, our game demo is running on iOS, the PC, the Mac, and Ubuntu Linux! Our intent is for the game to be on Steam (we like downloading the same game onto multiple platforms) and GOG.com (we also like DRM-free games too!)  So anyway you want, that's the way you need it, anyway you want it!\nIn Advanced Mode, you get to peek under the Hood!  Use the easy-to-learn WanderScript and change the behavior of any object in the level on the fly! (It's basically the Lua scripting language with some game functions built in.) Put in monsters, objects, NPCs, and more, and control them with simple clear commands, or use the WanderWizard to get a quick start on your script.  \nMockup of accessing an object's WanderScript.\nUse the simple WanDirector to make little cutscenes to start and end levels (or to punctuate important parts of the game). \nChange the WanderScript controlling the whole level: how do you finish it? What do you need to collect?  We'll provide a bunch of useful objects to tell your own story with a game!  \nMockup of the The Editor assigning Fun Points.\nThen the Editor makes sure your level has enough Fun in it, and that it is finishable -- then you Publish it!\nThanks for your time! We hope you'll support our Kickstarter! This is truly a cool era when folks can get together and make something they dream about come into existence.  Take care! \nSincerely, the folks at...\nP.S.

The only challenge is the delivery of content to and from our company's servers, and with recent years of Facebook and Google+ development, those issues are known.\n Developing cross-platform is also a risk, since it is more than \"just compiling it\".

Plug in your device and you're ready to go.\"\nEcochunk - \"Juan Moncada has come up with the eClipse \u2013 a versatile solar powered charger that can charge multiple gadgets at once, not only during the day but even after dark.\"\nBackground:\nThe idea for the eClipse was born after Superstorm Sandy hit the East Coast in October. Having family there, I felt helpless because there was nothing I could do from my home in California, except wait for a phone call to find out if everything was okay. Thankfully my family was fine, but my thoughts turned to all the other people who weren\u2019t able to communicate with their loved ones because they didn\u2019t have power. On the internet, it seemed that every article I read had images of people huddled around extension cords and power outlets, trying to charge cell phones and electronic devices that had run out of battery.\nThat\u2019s when inspiration struck me.\nThe Concept:\nI came up with the eClipse, a portable solar product with multiple USB ports to charge multiple cell phones and electronic devices at once. It also has the ability to be used day or night. This way, if a power outage or emergency situation were to occur, a whole family could charge their cell phones at once using solar energy, any time of day. I went through several prototypes before settling on a form-factor similar to a miniaturized version of a rooftop solar panel, with a strong build that can stand up to heavy portable use.\nThe Materials:\nThe eClipse is solidly built with the following materials:\nShock absorbent polyethylene housing\nHigh-efficiency crystalline solar panel\nHigh life-cycle energy bank with lithium-polymer batteries \nCustom designed PCB controller circuit board\nHigh-efficiency crystalline solar panels are more expensive, but I chose this technology because of its power. In just 3 hours you can recharge the eClipse to 75% and in 5 hours to 100%.\nThe Product:\neClipse1U - One USB port\neClipse2U - Two USB ports\neClipse4U - Four USB ports\nEvery eClipse is available in the following colors: black, silver, blue, green, yellow, red, pink and orange.\nHow It Works:\nThe eClipse is a true plug and play device built with the user in mind - it's ready to go right out of the box! If the eClipse needs to be recharged, simply place it under sunlight, and the charging indicator will light up. When the eClipse battery is at full capacity, a built-in overcharge protector will automatically stop the eClipse battery from charging. At any time, whether it's charging or not, USB devices can be plugged into the eClipse's USB ports. All USB devices will continue to be powered until the eClipse needs to be recharged under sunlight again.\nPlace it in direct sunlight or by a window to recharge.\nCompatibility:\nThe eClipse is guaranteed to work with any device with a standard USB connector. It has been tested to power the following devices:\nCell phones (Apple iPhones, Android smartphones, Blackberry devices, any USB powered cell phone) \nTablets (Apple iPad, Samsung Galaxy Tab)\nPortable game consoles (Sony PSP)\ne-Readers (Kindle, Nook)\nMP3 players (Apple iPod, Sandisk Sansa)\nOther USB powered devices (Bluetooth headphones, flashlights, lanterns, etc.)  \nDuring my compatibility tests, I verified that the charging time for all USB devices is the same as if charging from a USB port on a computer or a wall charger.\nThe eClipse would make a great addition to a disaster preparation kit, but it can also be used anywhere power is needed on-the-go, including hiking and camping. It can even be used around the world in areas where electricity isn\u2019t readily available.\nBuilt for Rugged Use:\nSince the eClipse may be carried in a backpack during a hiking or other recreational trips, I have taken every precaution posible to ensure the eClipse is capable of rugged use.\n- The glass is 3.2mm thick. This is the same thickness used in solar panels on a roof top, which are designed to withstand hail storms.\n- The glass is encased in a shock absorbent polyethylene casing. The casing is custom designed for my panel, which allows the glass to sit slightly recessed doubling as a bumper.\n- The circuit boards are all separately sealed in casing for extra protection.\nAnd the great thing is there are no moving parts. This helps with longevity of use. \nSpecifications:\nThe USB 1.0A and 2.1A ports are fully compatible with smart-phones,  tablets and mp3 players that are powered with a USB connector.\nThe USB 2.1A port is fully compatible with iPhones, iPads, and iPods.\nThere is plenty of capacity to recharge multiple devices simultaneously.\nCharging times are same as using a USB wall charger. For example, the eClipse can charge an iPhone to 90% in 1.5 hours.\nThe high efficiency solar panel enables the eClipse to recharge to 75% in just 3 hours and to 100% in 5 hours - and it can still power all your USB devices while it's charging.\nWhether you have the 2 USB version or the larger capacity 4 USB version, the recharge time for the eClipse is the same!\nMy intention was to create a device that could be recharged to 100% everyday and used at full power each time it's needed. This guarantees an everyday, reliable source of power for all portable USB devices, and is especially useful during extended periods of power outage.\nSupport:\nI'll be building the eClipse in San Jose, California. This product uses great technology, but the reality is that it\u2019s not cheap to make because the components are expensive. With the help of the Kickstarter community, I want to buy the components in bulk so I can keep costs low and ensure that this device can be accessible to everyone. \n With the funds raised through Kickstarter, I\u2019d like to:\nConvert my prototypes to production-ready models \nBuy mass quantities of materials to make the product affordable \nDeliver a high quality product\nManufacturing Plan:\nIf my project is fully funded, my manufacturing plan is as follows:\nPhase One - Parts Order\n1. Have the eClipse frame manufactured in bulk quantities for the colors requested by project backers.\n2. Purchase high-efficiency solar panels in bulk quantities.\n3. Order the custom designed eClipse PCB controller circuit board, which will be made locally in Redwood City, CA, as well as mass quantities of essential circuitry components.\n4. Order the battery bank and USB ports.\nPhase Two - eClipse Assembly\n1. Assemble the PCB controller circuit board.\n2. Assemble each eClipse with custom color frame, high-efficiency solar panels, battery bank and USB ports.\nThroughout the assembly process, I will test to ensure product functionality.\nI anticipate I will be quite busy doing the assembly and testing, so I've asked my friend Hsien-Jun Tai to help with the logistics. She will help order all the parts and keep track of the shipments out to all the backers.\nThank You\nThank you very much for your interest in the eClipse. If you like what you see, please help me reach my goal. Any contribution is greatly appreciated! Even if you can't contribute today, please help me get the word out by clicking the Facebook \"Like\" button, and sharing my project with your family and friends!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe eClipse has been thoroughly tested and its hardware design is complete and fully functional. I have over ten years of experience QA testing solar and electrical products and I'm extremely confident in this product and its capabilities. Because of this, I feel that technically, the risks or challenges are very low.\n\nOne possible challenge is cost. With the help of the Kickstarter community, I'll be able to purchase the components in bulk at an ideal price per unit. By lowering the cost of each component that makes up the eClipse, I am then able to offer the eClipse at an affordable price to the Kickstarter community.\n\nAnother possible challenge will be building the eClipse in order to keep up with demand, however, this will depend on the number of backers and orders I receive. I have an outstanding relationship with my suppliers located in China, Taiwan, and San Jose and Redwood City in California, so obtaining the necessary materials to build the eClipse will not be a problem. The eClipse prototypes were all built with the parts from these suppliers and I have been in touch with them to let them know of my intentions to buy the materials in bulk. These suppliers all use the highest-quality materials available, so there will be no risks in regards to the quality of the product.\n\nI'm setting a very realistic goal of delivering the eClipse to my backers by April of 2013, which will be approximately three months after the project ends. However, I fully intend to deliver each product before this! I will be very busy building and QA testing each eClipse myself in San Jose, California, and my friend Hsien-Jun Tai will ship each order as it becomes available.

BattleCON launched to rave reviews and continues to be a heavily played favorite of players who got involved in the project last year. Earlier this year, BattleCON: War of Indines was the most highly-rated kickstarter-produced board game on BoardGameGeek.com (among kickstarted games with 100 or more user ratings, we're currently 2nd highest ranked).\nBut don't take my word for it--here are some quotes from players and reviewers alike:\n\"I was blown away by how good this is... I kept thinking about playing it again.\" - Tom Vasel, the Dice Tower\n\"...a tense, quick battle that does an excellent job of recreating a fighting game\" - David Valdez, BGG Reviewer\n\"...this is absolutely lovely... I am seriously over the moon with this.\" - Paco Garcia Jean, GMS Magazine\n\" I am confident that you will enjoy the game.\" - Nate Kurth, BGG Reviewer\n\"this game is one of the stealth hits of 2011\" - David Kartinzel, Blagog Blog\n\"I still feel like I've barely scratched the surface despite 53 plays... There are so many matchups, and each matchup has a great deal of subtlety to it.\" - Scott Douglass, BGG Reviewer\n\"not only the best fighting game, not only one of the best games released in the past year or so but also one of the best games ever released\" - Rick Teverbaugh, Herald Bulletin\nRead and watch more reviews for War of Indines here.\nThis time, we want to raise the stakes and make the second BattleCON game top the first in every way. Tons more art, a box with built-in character dividers, and tougher, higher quality cards that will stand up to the worst cases\nAdditional Play Modes\nFor Devastation, we've expanded two modes of play from the previous game and included three exciting brand new modes of play.\nExtra Mode: Bosses\n4v1 Boss Mode provides a unique experience for BattleCON Veterans. We have two huge bosses with their own modes built around them. These bosses are so big they can take on 4 players at once and require the entire extended 9-space board included in Devastation.\nIn a radical departure from typical 'boss characters', Devastation includes a Hero Boss--that is, a 'good guy' boss for your villains to fight against: Runika and her gigantic golem: Udstad!\nWe've also included a boss who appears to 'test' those heroes who would fight against the Dragon King's rebirth, the ancient dragon Larimore Burman:\nExtended Mode: New Multiplayer\nMultiplayer in War of Indines worked, but we always thought it could be improved upon. In Devastation, Multiplayer happens on a single-track extended board with 9 spaces. This updated multiplayer allows new team-play tactics like sharing soak and stun guard, blocking for your allies, and corner-locking unwary opponents.\nExtended Mode: Arenas\nArenas added brand new play styles and universal rules in the first BattleCON game, and we're extending that tradition with brand new arenas. The new arenas will be printed on oversize cards, so you'll be able to see in detail all of the awesome artwork and it will be easier to read the effects.\nEach arena has two sides to it. At a certain point during the battle, the arena card will flip, changing the game drastically midway through and providing new challenges.\nNew Mode: BattleQUEST\nOne of the most-requested elements of BattleCON was a solo play and cooperative against-the-game mode. BattleQUEST plays like a side-scrolling dungeon where up to 3 friends can team up and fight their way through a series of automated monsters. BattleQUEST converts BattleCON into a cooperative puzzle challenge\u2013when played in multiplayer, it's a test of coordination and planning for any group.\nExtra Parts: Double-Sided Finishers\nIn the first BattleCON game, you only had one big blowout attack to use. In Devastation, we're doubling that by giving players two different finishers to activate. Choose which one you want to prepare at the start of the duel, and unleash it later on for a powerful game-changer.\nExtra Parts: Extended Board\nIn the new BattleCON game, we're going to have a big tri-fold board that is more than 10 times as large as the original game board! The new board has space for you to place your cards, reminder text for how beats progress, and enough space to play extended multiplayer modes included in the game.\nCrossover Promo Characters\nWe've pulled together a cast of exciting crossover promotional characters from across the board! These characters will be included at all reward tiers where we ship you a physical product.\nIf you don't know some of the Crossover Characters, don't worry. Many are joining BattleCON from the Future!!! (That is, you'll get to know them pretty soon, either via our upcoming projects or the upcoming projects of our friends!)\nAny pledge tier that receives a physical copy of Devastation will receive one set of these promos per boxed copy of the game!\nMascot Promo Characters\nIn Devastation, we're introducing a brand new kind of promotional character: Mascots. The mascot characters have 8 pieces of unique artwork, as they take on the costumes and abilities of different characters within their respective games.\nJuto is the mystical panda companion of Tatsumi, a Water Mystic from War of Indines. Juto utilizes attacks from 7 different characters in the War of Indines game for an unpredictable mix of power and positional control.\nBorneo is the penguin familiar of Lesandra, the Battle Summoner from Devastation of Indines. Borneo mimics 7 characters from Devastation, giving him a solid mix of powerful technical attacks.\n(Check their links above to see all of their alternate costumes)\nAny pledge tier that receives a physical copy of Devastation will receive one set of these mascots per boxed copy of the game!\nStrikers\nWhy go it alone? Strikers is a small-box expansion to BattleCON that replaces Special Actions and provides new combinations of tactics. Support your character with your second-string fighter, or use Strikers in Tag Team play to call in your tag-partner for a quick assist.\nStrikers contains all the characters from both BattleCON games, and even some future characters we have yet to meet on the battlefield! It is a true expansion, so you will need either the original BattleCON: War or the new BattleCON: Devastation game to use it.\nLearn More about Strikers\nStretch Goals & Stretch Characters\nWe've also put together tons of stretch goals to expand the game even further.

With this experience, we have set reasonable shipping dates, funding goals, and reward tiers that stand in line with what we know we're capable of. \n\nWe're constantly learning from the past and working towards making our upcoming projects better and more reliable. Here's some examples of what turns projects have taken in the past, and how we're compensating for them with Devastation.\n\nIn our first BattleCON project (http://kck.st/gWR9kt), our shipping estimates proved to be far too low. This time we've gotten all of our estimates (especially our stretch goals!) in advance, so that we are sure we can produce and deliver what we're promising without going broke. \n\nIn our most recent project, the Minigame Library (http://kck.st/L8EgIw) we had some production delays due to a manufacturing defect we had to correct. This project is currently completed and in transit to our warehouse. It should be shipping out in January. To compensate for a similar possible problem in this project, we've adjusted our production goals to accommodate potential delays. While it's likely we can deliver the product earlier than schedule, we are confident we can make the July deadline, no matter what comes up.\n\nOne thing I have a commitment to in all of the Level 99 Games projects is honesty and openness. If there's a delay, you'll know when I know. If there's a defect, you'll hear about it as soon as I do. As a backer, you become a part of the production process, and all the ups and downs that entails along with it.\n\nAn of course, the most important challenge for BattleCON: Devastation will be to top all your expectations for this new edition! We feel that after a solid year of planning, playtesting, and development that we're ready to take on that challenge!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #127", "update_userinfo": "BattleCON Unleashed, the ultimate (yes, that means final) BattleCON Kickstarter!", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #126", "update_userinfo": "11 Hours left to go for the new War Project!", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #125", "update_userinfo": "War is here!", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #124", "update_userinfo": "BattleCON: War Preview!

Shipping is free inside the continental US, $5 for Canada, Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico, and $15 everywhere else.\n____________________\nProfessor Pugnacious' Portfolio of Perils, Pugilism, and Perfidy-the Card Game of Victorian Combat pits Steampunk Heroes against Gothic Horrors in a fight to be the greatest monster hunter in the world-both by defeating your Adversaries, the creatures themselves, and by foiling your rivals-the other players.\nYou take on the role of one of Professor Pugnacious' prize pupils. You and your rivals set out not merely to rid the world of the horrors that infect it, but to do so better than anyone else - whether that means sabotaging your classmate's equipment, stealing another's invention idea, or even forming alliances and working together to foil a more powerful rival. \nProfessor Pugnacious is a game for 2-4 players. \nTurns are taken simultaneously, and have four phases: Play Cards, Buy Cards, Combat, and Recovery. Cards give you Skill, which you use to buy cards; Fight, which you use to defeat adversaries; Failure, which you use to foil the other players' plans; Draw, which gives you more cards, and a whole host of special abilities.\nOn a turn, you'll play cards, use their special abilities, buy cards, pick an Adversary to fight, negotiate how to distribute Failure with your rival players, and then reap the reward for winning or suffer the penalty for losing your fight. The Card Ring will rotate once, and the next turn will begin.\nYou can read the complete rules here and a description of how the Card Ring works here.\nIf you donate at least $1, then you can download a print-and-play copy of the cards, and play the entire, complete game right now! We trust that if you do you'll enjoy it enough to come back and get the complete version, with all of the art, design, and high-quality cards.\n\"The 'Card Ring' is brilliant! This mechanic is the gem of your design, and one I really like a lot. The choices one must make from their own queue, coupled with the impact of 'shifting' the cards, is very well done\" - Tox, Crits Happen\nProfessor Pugnacious has been awarded the Springboard Seal of Quality.\nWe're confident you'll love Professor Pugnacious because of the innovative mechanics, the immersive theme, and the extensive playtesting it's undergone. \nThe mechanics were designed from the ground up to fill a space we saw lacking among deckbuilding games. We wanted something tactical - you can't just plan out a grand strategy at the beginning, you have to make decisions every turn - fast paced - turns are taken simultaneously, so there's nearly no waiting - and interactive - you can manipulate the Card Ring, which is where people buy their cards from, and you can assign Failure, so your opponents lose their fights. This means you need to make decisions that take into account what kinds of decks other people are building, and leads to a lot of political intrigue, as players bargain and backstab to avoid being made to fail and to trick and trap opponents.\nThe theme theme and style - well, just look at them. Andrea's really put together something incredible. It's not just the card art: the design of the cards and the box all pull you in to this strange world of Victoriana. But that's not all! Each copy of the game will come with an mp3 of theme music composed by Brent Hengeveld. Scan the code, get it on your phone, and play it in the background during your game for an incredibly immersive experience. Oh what the heck, have it for free now. Enjoy his other music as well.\nHere's some examples of the cards you can buy:\nIf you're worried about the legibility of the cards, don't be-we're going to get a printed proof of the game before yours gets printed, and if the design doesn't work, we will edit it until it does. We already have ideas in case changes become necessary.\nHere are some enemies you can fight:\nThis game has been very extensively playtested. Hundreds of man-hours, scores of games, dozens of playtesters on multiple continents have all ensured, through countless revisions, changes, major overhauls, and minor tweaks, that this game will be as good as it can be. Major thanks go out to former pro Magic: The Gathering player Zvi Mowshowitz, whose advice and assistance have been invaluable, and led to major changes to how trashing and enemies are designed.\nHere's one example of a minor change we've made: when you get a reward for killing a monster, that comes into effect on the next turn. Some players were finding it difficult to remember all of the effects, so now we have these handsome tokens to help everyone remember. \nIf you donate at least $1 now, you can get access to a complete print and play copy of the cards, meaning you could be playing the game in just a few minutes if you want to. We're so confident you'll love the game once you play it that we expect you to come back and donate enough to get the actual physical copy of the game, with all the gorgeous art intact.  \nIn addition, for $5 each on top of any other donation, you can get these mini-expansions. Or for $20, you can get all five! \nThis Lovecraftian themed mini-expansion features a new Setting, the Maze of Unnatural Geometry, and a new Finale, the Maddening Monstrosity. \nThis Holmesian mini-expansion features a new Class, the Great Detective, and a new Finale, the Criminal Mastermind. \nThis industry-themed expansion features a new Class, the Captain of Industry, and a new Setting, the Age of Industry. \nThis undead expansion features new enemies, Zombies, a new Finale, Count Dracula, and a new Location, Castle Dracula. \nThis mini-expansion will never be available anywhere else. The only way to get it will be to back this Kickstarter. This mini-expansion features a several new cards for the Main Deck and a new Setting, the New Economy.\nIf we get enough funding, then we can get the game made, but what happens if we get extra? We can get the expansions made! Whenever a reach goal gets met, we'll be giving away a free copy of each expansion to everyone who donated at least $40. The expansions will retail for $20, so your donation can get pretty valuable pretty quick if people donate enough, so spread the word!\nTreachery! The first expansion to Professor Pugnacious. The theme is Failure. This introduces two new mechanics: Stealth cards, which aren't revealed until after combat targets have been assigned, and the first Class, the Traitor, who give special abilities and alternate win conditions. Abandon all pretense of teamwork, join up with the horrors, and destroy your rivals! Includes a new Finale: the Rival Professor.\nLocomotion! The second expansion to Professor Pugnacious. The theme is the Card Ring. This introduces two new mechanics: Settings and Locations. The former affect all players and are in the Card Ring, while the latter affect a specific Adversary and are in the Enemy Deck. Includes a new Finale: the Runaway Locomotive. \nWe are Sixpence Games.\nThomas Eliot has been playing boardgames and \u201cimproving\u201d them since he was 1d6 years old. He\u2019d always dreamed of becoming a board game designer, but didn\u2019t realize that he actually could make that happen until last year. Businessweek called him a \u201cGuardian of the Apocalypse\u201c, which has nothing to do with boardgames, but he can\u2019t resist bringing it up.\nAndrea Renaisse is a forty-something artist from Vancouver, Washington. Raised in the Pacific Northwest, she lives in a 1935-never-gonna-get-fixed-up-cause-stuff-keeps-breakin house with her companion, two dogs, a cat, and one very bratty beagle who thinks she is a daughter. Andrea has a B.F.A. from Pacific Northwest College of Art and a M.Ed. from Central Washington University. Currently she operates her family advertising business, but her spare time, if there is any, revolves around doing art and playing video games like she is a teenager.\nBrent Hengeveld is the next John Williams. A recent graduate of the University of Southern California's SMPTV program (Scoring for Motion Pictures and Television), he is available to hire to write the soundtrack to your next hit game or billion dollar blockbuster film, or whatever else pays the bills. His hobby is trying to build a time machine so he can be a contemporary of John Williams.\nProfessor Pugnacious is being manufactured by Panda Games Manufacturing, manufacturer of such games as Pandemic. Distribution is being handled by Game Salute, distributor of such games as Alien Frontiers.\nWe will be Kicking it Forward, which means that 5% of the profits we make off of Professor Pugnacious will be contributed to other Kickstarters.

That means the potential problems can come from one of three areas: art, manufacturing, and shipping. Something could happen to Andrea, the artist - she could be struck by an automobile, or kidnapped by one of her nefarious nemeses, or be caught in some other cataclysmic catastrophe in which case we would be forced to find a new artist to finish the Project. The manufacturer, Panda Games, could suffer a disaster, in which case we would use a backup. The most realistic failure is that we underestimated the cost of shipping, in which case hopefully the campaign has raised enough to cover it anyways. Otherwise it looks like oh well, it'll be coming out of our pockets. No matter what happens, we will get you your game! And keep in mind, when you donate any amount of money you'll get a print and play copy of the game and the mp3, so there's nothing that can stop that (on the off chance that enough people donate that the bandwidth on our website isn't enough to handle the downloads, we'll host them elsewhere).\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #42", "update_userinfo": "Cultists of Cthulhu is now available for free on Tabletop Simulator", "update_content": "You can download it here.
