[{"backer": "Jerry Willoughby", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Welcome Back to the House of Fear!\nWe're back with our 7th issue of House of Fear, and our 5th Kickstarter campaign!\nHouse of Fear blends everything you love about Goosebumps, Scooby-Doo, and Tales From the Crypt. Each issue features complete, stand-alone stories that are always exciting, sometimes humorous, and occasionally downright scary.\n(Okay,  it's not that scary. There are no nightmares here. But we've learned that young readers love the idea of reading comics their parents think are too scary for them.) \nWe're using this Kickstarter campaign to raise funds to print the 33-page issue, House of Fear: Rubber & Glue, and hopefully, we'll hit a couple of Stretch Goals along the way for some additional items. \nWhat's it About?\nOur first story, \"Rubber & Glue,\" introduces us to a couple of students from Savini Middle School.\nCaden and Isaac aren't exactly friends. \nAnd everything is most certainly not okay here. \nCaden thinks he has the upper hand, as always. But this time, he's in for a shock. Isaac isn't just repeating a childish retort...\n...but instead is casting a curse. One that will force Caden to live a day in the life of the bullied. \nThis story isn't the Monster-of-the-Month fare you've come to expect from House of Fear, but instead, examines the roles we play in middle school, and shines light on just how easy a harmless prank becomes something worse. It's as if Stephen King wrote an after-school special. \nThis issue also features a backup story, \"The Trees Have Eyes.\" This one starts peacefully enough, with Tosh and his dad out for a pleasant hike in the woods. \nWell, maybe not so peaceful or pleasant for Dad. And when they venture off the trail...\n...and into a copse of aspen trees, things take a turn for the worse.\nTrust me, you'll never look at Aspen trees the same again. \nWhat to Expect\nHere's what you can expect when you back our latest campaign:\nOne issue featuring two complete, stand-alone stories.\n33 pages of full-color thrills.\nFun, exciting comics suitable for (almost) all ages.\nBagged/boarded comics shipped in sturdy packaging.\nWe print House of Fear domestically, which means a faster turn around time (within 2 months of the campaign end).  \nWe're now printing on a heavy 70 lb paper stock with a 100 lb cover stock.  A heavier stock means the comics stand up to multiple reads and make the book more suitable for sharing. \nStretch and Milestone Goals\nWe recently had our 175th backer, which means every backer gets a set of print-at-home activity pages. This set includes prompts for kids to draw their own monsters and comics, and of course, also includes coloring pages. \nIf we reach 200 backers, all backers will receive a PDF of the B&W version of The Trees Have Eyes. See Jethro's line work in all its glory in this special version of the story. \nIf we reach 225 backers, I'll upgrade the Digital Deluxe PDF to a full, behind-the-scenes, making of book. I received lots of feedback after our last campaign for this style of book, and I'm excited for the opportunity to do it again for Rubber & Glue.\nOur First Kickstarter Exclusive Variant\nWe're big fans of the old EC comics, so for this campaign, we created our first variant cover as an homage to those horror comics from the 50s. Those are James Hislope's lines, and Josh Jensen's colors, with Matt Krotzer on letters and design. They absolutely nailed it, didn't they?\nAs a way to reward backers with a piece of House of Fear history, the variant is an exclusive to Kickstarter. We'll print to order (with an overage of 10% to cover possible damage during transit), so don't expect too many of these to make it to my online shop or to convention tables. \nThe Rare, Serialized Variant\nWe've also got a rare variant for this campaign. This one features art by Jethro Morales and colors by Josh Jensen. There will be no House of Fear trade dress on the cover. Just the frightful artwork. \nEach copy will be individually serialized to only 31 copies. \nBoyle Minifig\nWe've partnered with Justin at Saber-Scorpion to produce a limited-edition Boyle minifig. The look and accessories are specific to this issue and will only be made available during this campaign. \nThe image below is a prototype of what you can expect.\nExclusive, Crossover Print\nOur first House of Fear crossover is here! Anyone who backs a physical reward for this campaign and the one for Phil Falco's Haunting 1-3 will receive this exclusive print, signed by the writers on both books. (Digital backers who back both will receive a digital version of the art.)\nStunning art by Jethro Morales and Josh Jensen\nHaunting is a solid, supernatural horror comic for teens and adults. So if you have older kids in your house or if you like to sample new horror for yourself, now's the time to try something new!  \n The Rewards \nAdd Ons\nIf you've backed a print tier, you can add additional print copies of House of Fear: Rubber & Glue. You can also catch up on all of the House of Fear comics with the Digital Catch Up add on. We have stickers, too!\nAfter you select a tier to back, Kickstarter will take you to the Add-On page. If you see another issue you'd like to have, simple select it from the Add-On page. \nOther print issues of House of Fear will be available as add-on options after the campaign has ended.\nPreview Pages\nBelow are pages from House of Fear: Rubber & Glue.\nShipping and Delivery\nOur young readers aren't overly concerned with mint comics. All they care about is reading the story....and rereading it as many times as possible. \nBut there are a lot of collectors reading House of Fear, too. We know true horror is getting a Kickstarter package in the mail and finding a crumpled comic inside.\nWith that in mind, we pack our books with the same care we used in making the book and the love that we have for our backers.\nAll comics come bagged and boarded. \nAny order that consists of 1 or 2 comics will be shipped in a sturdy, oversize envelope (stay flat mailers from Pratt Plus). \nAll orders of 3 or more comics will be shipped in a Gemini Mailer for added protection. \nAll packages will be sent via USPS Media Mail, First Class, or Priority Mail, depending on weight.\nTimeline and Budget\nThe comic is 100% complete, so all we need to do is send the issue and sticker sheet to the printers. After 2-3 weeks, I'll start shipping everything to backers. \nBut where do the funds go?\nAbout half of the funds we earn through Kickstarter will be used to print the comic and other rewards. Shipping will take approximately 40% of the funds we receive, and 10% goes to Kickstarter for hosting the campaign.\nAny extra money we earn from the campaign will help pay for future issues of House of Fear.\n Meet the Creators \nWill You Help Us Make Comics for Kids?\nIt's simple: We love making fun, exciting comics, and we want to get them to as many readers as I possibly can. We can't do that without support from readers like you.\nThank you for checking out our latest project. We hope you find a reward that suits you well, and when you do, that you back the campaign and help us continue making exciting, action-packed comics for kids.\nThank you!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is my FIFTH Kickstarter campaign! The comic is already complete, and all we have left to do is print the comic and other rewards. \n\nWe're big fans of the Kickstarter platform, and we know how important it is for backers to get their rewards in a timely manner. So we plan to do everything we can to meet your expectations. Of course, if anything comes up that throws us off schedule, we will keep Kickstarter backers updated.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "Digital", "descp": "Receive a PDF copy of HOUSE OF FEAR: RUBBER & GLUE.\nINCLUDES:\nPDF of HOUSE OF FEAR: RUBBER & GLUE\nThank you/credit in PDF", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2021"}], "stat": ["54 backers", "Add-ons"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 8 or more", "title": "Deluxe Digital", "descp": "Receive a PDF copy of HOUSE OF FEAR: RUBBER & GLUE, which includes bonus behind-the-scenes art pages.

But when her younger brother is captured by the evil exterminator and his clutter of arachnids, she must overcome her fear to save him...and the world.\nWhat Do You Get?\nOur comics blend everything you love about Goosebumps, Scooby-Doo, and Tales From the Crypt. House of Fear was created as a way to introduce kids to scary stories, but our comics are great for anyone who likes fun, exciting fantasy-adventure comics. \nHere's what you can expect when you back our latest campaign:\nA complete, stand-alone, 32-page comic.\nA story suitable for all ages.\nOff-set printing for highest quality.\nBagged/boarded comics shipped in sturdy packaging.\nI'm confident you and your family will enjoy our comics.

And the cover stock is a little thicker, too, which is a nice bonus for collectors and children.\nWhat Critics Are Saying  \nIn 2019, Dark Horse Comics published a collection of House of Fear stories. \nWhen the book hit shops, we received good feedback from readers and critics. Here's what they were saying about it online... \nPreview Pages\nEnjoy this preview of House of Fear: The Infestation of Mr. Skinny Legs. \nWhy Quickstarter?\nNot long after our last campaign, the House of Fear team created \"The Infestation of Mr. Skinny Legs.\" We had the Kickstarter page nearly complete, but the timing didn't quit work out. And then, when Covid hit, comics were moved to the back burner for awhile.\nDespite having already printed the rewards, we held off on launching until we made progress on future comics. Our goal for this short campaign is to reintroduce the series to readers, and get a jump start on creating more issues in 2021.\nThe Rewards   \nReceive a PDF version of House of Fear: The Infestation of Mr. Skinny Legs.\nReceive a print copy of House of Fear: The Infestation of Mr. Skinny Legs.\nGet two copies of House of Fear: The Infestation of Mr. Skinny Legs.

Call it a director's cut, a digital-deluxe version, or a making-of supplement, but this book will be more than just a script book. More than just a handful of sketches and inked pages, too.\nFor this digital book, I've pulled together all the resources I have from when we made the comic, including the various stages of the script, art changes and the discussions about them, character descriptions, sample colors, and so much more. \nAdd Ons  \nAfter you select a reward tier, Kickstarter will ask if you'd like to add any other rewards. If you backed a physical reward level, you can add one or more of these House of Fear comics.\nWhere do the Funds Go?\nBecause the rewards are already printed and ready to go, the bulk of the funding will be used for shipping, packaging costs, and Kickstarter fees.

These mercenaries and peddlers of rodent disposal now stand on the precipice of fame and glory, all they have to do is their job, right?\nOBJECTIVE\nThe Ratcatchers objective: To rid the city of as many rats as possible on their way to gathering as much Magical Cheese as possible.\nWIN - The RATCATCHER is victorious if you achieve any one of the following criteria;\n\u2022 The Ratcatcher collects 10 Magic Cheese or The Ratcatcher slays the Nemesis Rat\nLOSE - The Ratcatcher is defeated if the Rats achieve one of the following criteria;\n\u2022 The Rats consume 10 Magic Cheese or The Ratcatcher is reduced to 0 wounds\n\nThe Ratcatcher (Player) Turn: \nDuring your Ratcatchers turn, they\u2019re seeking to vanquish rats & gather Magical Cheese. This can be done using the various skills and actions listed on the Character Board.   \nMagic Cheese Tokens\nUnlock/Upgrade:\nOnce the Ratcatcher can successfully gather some Magical Cheese then the fun of upgrading and customising your Ratcatcher can begin.  \nBy assigning a Magic Cheese you may unlock a chosen ability. Once active place the maximum number of the relevant tokens on the Character Board.\n The Rats (AI) Turn: \nDependent on the type of Rat, the rats will either seek out the Magical Cheese or attack the Ratcatcher. White rats as the most numerous, and though simple in appearance their strength becomes apparent when they swarm towards pieces of cheese. Brown rats are vicious and ill tempered, set on attacking any who come close these rodents must be disposed of carefully. Black rats, are the breeders and with them comes even more rats. Each time a black rat is placed, additional rats are immediately placed. In addition to that each spawn phase Black rats count as a Spawn Point for even more rats! \nPeculiar Rats: \nThe Magic Cheese can have wonderful and miraculous effects, this effect is not limited to humanity only. The rats are eating the cheese and it has had some peculiar effects on them.\nThe Peculiar rats imbue the power of the magic cheese forming a nasty mini boss style adversary that will complicate the Ratcatcher's quest but also offers a variety of tempting rewards should the Ratcatcher be bold enough to catch one. \nNemesis Rats:\nNemesis Rats are true horrors of their species. The Magical Cheese has twisted their mind and body, into something spawned from the most terrible of nightmares. As catalysts of the Rat infection, destroying them is the of the utmost importance and seems the only logical path to freeing the kingdom.\nEach Nemesis on top of having their own unique abilities, also has a varied Rat tracker. As the Rats collect Magic Cheese, this tracker will gain momentum, modifying the common rats, spawning Peculair rats and triggering the spawning of the Nemesis Rat. This makes each variant Nemesis a unique challenge.  \nExpanding the Township:  \nTownship Cards - Tarot Sized Cards\nThe sprawling streets of Brie are the battle zone of The Ratcatcher. Filled with twists and turns it will require a keen eye to find the cheese & tactical choices to stay a head of the rat horde.  \nIf there are fewer than two Magic Cheese tokens in the city, then a mandatory Explore Action is undertaken. This will expand the city using additional township cards. Each new Township card will also add more cheese, opportunities to refill/recuperate & of course, more rats. \n\n WHY PLEDGE NOW:\nAs with most projects using crowdfunding, The Ratcatcher solo adventure board game will not possible to publish without the financial commitment of backers.

This game is for one player only. During this Kickstarter campaign there are no plans for any changes regarding this matter. Although that is not to say future expansions will adhere to this ethos.\n Alternative Languages Rules:  Currently we have a Spanish fan made rulebook. At his time I am open to establishing French & German fan based rulebooks at this stage. These will be community based rulebooks. Dependent on demand we may seek professional translation to be available with the games commercial release. \nCOMMUNITY TRANSLATIONS\n ITALIAN: A small group of Italian backers have started working on translation of the rulebook. If you're keen on helping out, head over to the BGG forum: ITALIAN TRANSLATION\n   FRENCH: It looks like there may be a solution for a French translation in the near future but in the mean time, French fans, can we get a forum going for this?

If you're keen on helping out, head over to the BGG forum: GERMAN TRANSLATION\n  FAQ - Pledging:\n Late Pledges: We will be partnering with Gamefound to assist with late Pledges, note that Late/Pledges & pre-orders will NOT have subsided shipping included. By backing at any level you will qualify for Free/subsided shipping should you choose to upgrade your pledge during the pledge manager.\n Stretch Goals: All Stretch goals unlocked during the Kickstarter campaign will be included FREE of charge in every copy of The Ratcatcher. Also where applicable, stretch goals will also be added to the Print and Play pledge level.  \n Multiple copies of the game: There are two options for the purchase of multiple copies, either by pledging at any level a backer will have access to the post campaign Pledge Manager (Gamefound.com), this will allow the backer to add additional copies of the game, shipping will be calculated & charged as a bundle (so you should save a bit of money). Alternatively if you have a few fellow gamers there is the Horde pledge, which will give you a discount as well as discount shipping. Just because it's a solo game dosen't mean we can be social ;) \nFAQ - Shipping:\n What is Subsidised shipping?: This is me covering a portion of the total shipping costs. Platypus Industries will pay $10 AUD of the total shipping cost. This is a little thank you for supporting us during the Kickstarter campaign. \n Shipping black zones: Sadly as much as it pains us to to say. There are certain locations around the world that we will NOT be able to deliver our product. We are sorry if this causes any inconvenience, but we encourage all affected to contact their local FLGS as they may find Distribution/alternative routes to obtain copies.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWorld economics: firstly, we are not economists.

We are confident moving forward into the manufacturing process for this product. \n\nShipping/fulfilment: One of the most unpredictable facets of Kickstarter delivery. We will endeavour to keep everything manageable but there are plenty of elements that will be out of our control.

If additional artwork is required is all done by the resident artist so there will not be any delays with any required artwork. \n\nGame Design & Development: the core game is locked in, but as with any crowd funding campaigns, with so many eyes on the design I\u2019m sure there will be some great ideas and insight into the design that may need to be implemented.

Enter: Keene, an independent contractor brought in to help figure out how and why she died. What unfolds is a mystery spanning decades that becomes less about why one woman dies and more about why a building would conspire to make it happen.\nThis 24 page one-shot utilises a central conceit that can only work in comics - every single page is framed exactly the same way, it\u2019s a front shot of the KDP building, but different panels and tiers of the page can jump around through time. Collins\u2019 expressive and intricate inkwork delivers us characters and moments through zoomed panels and cutaway areas so each page jumps around in time to build a truly epic story.\nThis comic is nearly completely finished and ready to deliver.\nNEWSPAPER SIZED PRINT STOCK\nThis comic is something special. The detail and care Collins put into every page needed more than the US standard sized comic could hold. You deserve to be able to spread this out and drink it in, so we\u2019ve decided to print this as an extremely oversized edition. At over twice the size of a regular comic, this is more like a newspaper in your hands.\nThe nature of the size means the comic will be folded to be posted to you, but this isn\u2019t a CGC affair anyway, this is the kind of thing you rattle with your hands with every read, the kind of thing you share with your mates, and the kind of thing that deserves to live.\nWe hope you agree.\nDIGITAL OPTIONS\nThere is a digital option for this comic, if you want to take it in as a PDF, but you will naturally forego that size element that makes this something special - unless you read it on an iPad Pro, or perhaps an interactive tv screen. \nFIRST DAY BACKER PARTY\nFor those who back in the First 48 Hour Window, well, do I have some goods for you.\nEarly believers get their hands on some extra digital swag, where you'll be instantly linked to:\nA PDF of BEAUTIFUL CANVAS #1 [art by Sami Kivela], and\n2 PDFs of my short comics about a prison for supervillains and a guard with size manipulation powers, LITTLE MAN IN THE BIG HOUSE [art by Paul Tucker, and Francesco Iaquinta]\nPLEDGE LEVELS\n$4 - Building Schematic\nA PDF of the comic with the script in a separate document.\n$10 - Talking Building\nA PDF of the building with a speech balloon or caption poorly lettered on, downloaded as jpeg, and emailed to you.

I\u2019ve also worked with Vertigo, Dark Horse, IDW, ComixTribe, and Black Mask to release comics like ETERNAL, NEGATIVE SPACE, BEAUTIFUL CANVAS, CHUM, and HEADSPACE.\nMitchell Collins - Mitch Collins is an Australian comic book artist. He loves to tell all sorts of stories, bringing pictures to the words. His credits include being part of Gestalt Comics TALGARD and featuring in the upcoming UNDAD VOL 3 and this comic here. He also works in storyboarding for short films, animations, UI & UX concepts. When MItch isn\u2019t working, he usually enjoys a nice cold one and a cigar out by the pool.\nSimon Robins - Simon's keen interest in comics was sparked by 2000AD as a young teen and has grown consistently since. He graduated from the Victorian College of the Arts with a Bachelor of Fine Arts majoring in photography where he created sequential photographic collages for his final porfolio and RMIT with a Masters of Design focusing on the visual communicative power of comics. Changing his career direction from design to comic book colouring, his career in comics started a little later than many. Simon draws on the skills and experienced gained from two decades working in the design and photographic industries to inspire his comic book colouring.

Classic wire bristle brushes can be dangerous to use. The bristles can easily break off the scraper, and get left behind on the grill. Ingestion of wire bristles can cause perforated esophagus or intestines, which are serious medical conditions and surprisingly common given the popularity of the wire bristle brush.\nThese bristles can cause damage while you eat, which isn\u2019t a good mood setter for your summer cookout. \n Set a good mood for your summer cookout! \nThe Grrrilla scraper takes away this possibility by providing the same capabilities as your traditional scraper, in a compact size with a strong solid body of stainless steel as opposed to bristles.\nHow do you clean a grill brush? You don't. Gross. Until Now!\nClean Grrrilla in the dishwasher!\nSimply remove the leather cord and put it in the dishwasher!\n------------------------------------\nFEATURES\nOur Grrrilla design is unique to us, as is its versatility. This scraper is compatible with almost any model of charcoal, propane (gas), and campground grills. \nThe Grrrilla\u2019s compact size creates a lower risk for any breaking or chipping, while still leaving realistic space for usage of the product allows for easy storage while still being easy to use. \nIt also functions as a bottle opener! \nAn extra way to ensure you have the tools you need for your cookout.  \nFor those who like to grill by lakes, or who simply like to take their portable grills out of the backyard once in a while, this tool provides a compact way to make sure every grill you use is clean. Compatible with most grills and able to fit in your pocket or picnic bag, this tool is designed for the adventurous griller as well as the everyday one.\nWe are launching a unique set of stainless steel skewers as well!    \nTo make sure you really have everything you need, we have made companion skewers to our Grrrilla. Our laser cut stainless steel designs create durable products that can be used repeatedly without fear of quick wear or bending. The skewers are 9-inches long and made to fit any of your kebab needs.\n-------------------------------\nSPECS\nWhile the durability and function found in these tools are important to us, so are the people who make them. All of our production work on this project is, as always, completely within the USA. Our skewers even celebrate this with an American flag laser cut into the top of each one. So throw them on the grill, and get a couple burgers going to celebrate with us!

It performs better than nonstick pans that cost over $130, at a fraction of the price. No gimmicks. No BS marketing claims. Just premium, long-lasting performance at an honest price. \nWe love nonstick pans for cooking eggs and delicate foods, but they have always been a frustrating purchase for us. Because the truth is that ALL nonstick pans eventually stop working and start sticking when the coating wears off. There\u2019s no magic fix for this.\nPeople basically have two options: buy cheap nonstick pans that may last a few months or years at most, or expensive ones that may last a bit longer, but will still need to be replaced. Both options seemed pretty bad. So we decided to create something better.\nOur goal was simple. Create an insanely long-lasting and durable nonstick pan, and sell it for a price that\u2019s fair and affordable. We think we nailed it.\nSo how is it that we can make a nonstick pan that performs better than expensive ones which cost well over $100, and sell it for a fraction of that price? Simple. By cutting out traditional retail middlemen and selling directly to you online, we\u2019re able to offer incredible quality, at wholesale pricing \nPeople often ask how long nonstick pans last, and the true answer is \"it depends.\" The lifespan of a nonstick pan is not just related to the quality of the nonstick coating, but also to how frequently it's used and how it's cared for. \nWhat IS much clearer, is knowing when you need to replace your nonstick pan. Scratches. Sticking. Flakes. Hotspots. If your nonstick pan has any of these, it's time for an upgrade. \nBad Nonstick! Bad!\nThe Misen Nonstick System is made of two key parts: an industry leading, PFOA-Free Nonstick Coating, and an innovative Plasma Primer. Both elements work together to form a Nonstick System that is absurdly durable, and provides long-lasting performance.\nA good analogy for how nonstick coatings are applied is painting a wall. While the quality of the paint/coating and number of layers used matters, so too does does the primer, or how the wall/pan is prepared for accepting the paint/coating. This primer layer is a crucial and often overlooked element in making great nonstick. \nRather than using a traditional 'grit blasting' primer method, for the Misen Pan we decided to use an innovative Plasma Primer. Infused with Titanium, the Plasma Primer Layer is 2.5 times more effective than the traditional primers, and extends the hardness and abrasion resistance of nonstick coatings.\nPlasma Primer: How We Tested\nAdmittedly, we were skeptical when we heard about the very buzzword-y \"Plasma Primer.\" There are so many BS nonstick claims (\"it'll last forever!\") and infomercials, and we thought the Plasma Primer might be another gimmick. But after research, it seemed the the Plasma Primer was legit, and we wanted to test it out.\nWith the help of a low-profile shaking machine, we performed a series of forced abrasion tests meant to simulate long-term wear. We tested the Misen Nonstick Pan against many other nonstick pans without a Plasma Primer: Cheap Pans, Expensive Pans, and even Ceramic Pans. The Misen Nonstick Pan outperformed all of them.\nForced abrasion testing to simulate long-term wear\nIn forced abrasion testing, the Misen pan showed considerably less wear than other pans\nIn addition to the Plasma Primer, the second and equally important part of the Misen Nonstick System is...the nonstick coating itself! To again use a painting analogy, the quality of the paint/coating itself, and the number of coats/layers applied affect performance.\nFor our pan, we use Dupont's premier 3-Layer Platinum coating, modified to work even better with our Plasma Primer. This PFOA-Free coating is Dupont's most scratch and abrasion resistant nonstick finish, and is even designed to withstand normal metal utensils and abrasive scouring pads.\n(this was really fun)\nWe know safety is a major concern with nonstick pans, and dislike how many brands omit information about their nonstick, like what coating they use. We want you to be as informed as possible about the tools you're using to cook for yourself, your family, and your friends. To answer a common question of \"is nonstick safe?\", the short answer is yes. PTFE cookware is safe to cook with, but you should avoid very high temperatures. For more information and specifics, check out our FAQ.\nFor the base of our nonstick pan we used a 4.2 millimeter thick, commercial-grade aluminum construction. This thick base ensures a flat, even cooking surface for the life of your pan, and helps provide amazing heat distribution for better cooked foods.\nOn the bottom of our pan, we bonded a stainless steel plate to ensure it's compatible with any heat source. Gas, induction, electric - they all work. \n4.2MM thick aluminum base provides even heat distribution\nA Quick Rant! Many brands claim their nonstick pans are 100% dishwasher safe, and that you can use metal utensils on them. This is terrible advice! While doing either once in a while won't kill your pan, over time they wear your nonstick pan down faster. Don't do it!\nIt\u2019s important your pan feels comfortable and balanced while in use. The Misen Nonstick Pan has a cast stainless steel handle, riveted to the base for a strong, reliable connection that will last. The pan also features a removable stay-cool silicone grip with a textured underside for incredible comfort and control.\nPan heats up. Handle stays cool.\nThe design process will always be at the heart of Misen. Lovingly obsessing over every single consideration of a product is pure joy for us, and it was no different this time around. After countless sketches, prototypes, testing, and an unholy amount of eggs cooked (the smell...), we knew we had a nonstick pan that was truly special. \nCheesy Ending :)", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our third Kickstarter Campaign, and with each successive project we've launched, we've made a point to be farther along in development and ready for production.

Today, he awoke in the City Morgue with no real memory of who he is or how he got there. He only knows his name thanks to the toe tag he\u2019s wearing. \nSlipping out into the night, Hunter wanders the city, clad in clothing he gathered from a dumpster. He may not know anything about himself, but he instinctively knows every corner of the teeming metropolis. \nAnd the city seems to know him.\nTraffic flow seems to naturally break when he wants to cross the street. No door is locked to him, no metal gate sealed shut. When he runs into trouble (which happens quite a bit) the city seems to help him in some way.\nBut there are others who know him, too, or at least they think they do.\nThe Wide-Eyed Three is a group of conspiracy theory nutjobs who have been exiled from society\u2014for good reason. When they learn of Hunter\u2019s miraculous return from the dead, they think they\u2019ve found their ticket to redemption. And if they have to kill Hunter again and again to prove their wild theories, that\u2019s what they\u2019ll do!\nHunter\u2019s not a bad guy, but he has a secret.\nAnd that secret is a killer.\nMETRO is a 122-page (very) dark urban fantasy graphic novel. Set in New York City, this is a violent, chaotic story with good amounts of mayhem, carnage, and humor. It is also a story of magic and wonder, exploring the nature of the sprawling cities we call our homes. As Hunter awakens into the hidden and unfamiliar world that exists alongside our owns, he learns what it means to be a normal human\u2026 starting with the idea that there is no such thing as normal.\nThe cover for METRO will be drawn by the the amazing Francesco Francavilla! \n    \nBrian Quinn ( Co-Writer and Creator) is one of the stars of the TruTV televison series IMPRACTICAL JOKERS and one of the hosts of the hit podcast TELL 'EM STEVE-DAVE.\nCullen Bunn (Co-Writer and Creator) is the writer of comic books such as THE SIXTH GUN, HARROW COUNTY, UNCANNY X-MEN, and DEADPOOL KILLS THE MARVEL UNIVERSE.  \nWalt Flanagan (Artist and Creator) is one of the stars of the AMC television series COMIC BOOK MEN and one of the hosts of the hit podcast TELL \u2018EM STEVE-DAVE. He is also the artist of series such as BATMAN: The WIDENING GYRE.  \nPhilip R. Williams Jr. (Inker) is also known as Phill Will. He got his love of comics and art from his father and grandfather. Working on many indie titles, Phill is excited for readers to see his work.  \nWayne Jansen (Colorist) is a digital painter with a background in traditional materials and techniques.  \nMarie Enger (Letterer) Marie Enger is a catch-all comic artist whose previous work can be seen in PISTOLWHIP, 2 SISTERS, ADVENTURE TIME, TABLE TITANS, and WE ARE IN A DARK PLACE. She colors comics, too, but she only wears black.\nWe have been developing this first METRO story for some time now. Along the way, we have talked to numerous publishers about the project. As we drew ever-closer to finishing the book, though, we realized that the right approach for a book like this was to publish it ourselves. By releasing this book on our own, we maintain complete control of the content, and this is a book that pulls no punches and, frankly, scared the Hell out of some of the editors we talked to. \nNow, we can bring you this story exactly the way we wanted to--in all its messed-up glory. \nKickstarter allows us to create comic books for the joy of creating graphic novels and give our backers and supporters something unique and exciting. We love that a Kickstarter campaign lets us communicate and interact with our readers along the way. \nAll interior artwork for METRO is complete, and the graphic novel is going through final lettering and design. This graphic novel tells a complete tale, while introducing a vivid mythology and world ripe for exploration. Brian, Walt, and Cullen have already started working on a new graphic novel set in the world of METRO. This campaign will help us judge if there is interest in the next book!\nProceeds from this campaign will go toward creative costs and printing. \n We're keeping the reward levels fairly simple on this campaign. We are releasing a digital version of METRO ($10), a trade paperback version ($25), and a limited edition hardcover version ($50). If you just want to show a little support for the project, you can pledge at the $1 or $5 levels. We also have a few special reward levels, some featuring original art pages from the book or mystery boxes full of Cullen's comics! We haven't forgotten retailers who might want to support the book! We have a reward level to help you stock your shelves with Metro!\n $40,000 - Signed Bookplate - UNLOCKED!\nWhen we reach this stretch goal, all trade paperback and hardcover copies of the book will come with a bookplate SIGNED by Brian Quinn, Walt Flanagan, and Cullen Bunn. \n$55,000 - Print Set - UNLOCKED!\nWhen we reach this stretch goal, all trade paperback and hardcover copies of the book will come with a set of 4 Metro-themed prints by Walt and other surprise artists!\n$75,000 - Official Metro Handbook - UNLOCKED!\nWhen we reach this stretch goal, we will add \"Official Handbook to the Metro Universe\" entries to the PDF, trade paperback, and hardcover editions of the book!\n$100,000 - Campaign Exclusive Podcast - UNLOCKED!\nWhen we reach this stretch goal, Brian, Walt, and Cullen will record a special podcast that will be made available to everyone who pledged at the $10 reward level and above. \n$125,000 - Graphic Novel Foreword\nWhen we reach this stretch goal, Cullen will write a foreword that will be added to the graphic novel. \n$140,000 - Graphic Novel Afterword\nWhen we reach this stretch goal, Brian will write a afterword that will be added to the graphic novel.\n$155,000 - Additional Prints\nWhen we reach this stretch goal, we will add three more prints to the Metro print set!\n We have more exciting Add-Ons that will be unveiled as the campaign progresses!\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhen it comes to producing this comic, I've done quite a bit of research about comics on Kickstarter. Brian and Walt have run several successful campaigns, and we have partnered with experts in book production and deliver. \n\nBrian, Walt, and I did not want to launch this Kickstarter until the vast majority of the work was done. I'm happy to report that ALL of the artwork for this graphic novel is completed, and the book is being lettered as this campaign runs. \n\nThis means that we will be delivering this book very quickly. Digital versions of the book will deliver to backers almost as soon as the campaign funds (we'll need just a little time to finalize the \"Thank You\" page), and the book will be sent to the printer for hard copy production immediately. \n\nOur primary goal is getting this book into the hands of our readers, so we're focusing on that! We have a team ready to manage the logistics of shipping the books out as soon as they are ready to go!\n\nWe're teaming with one of the biggest and best crowdfunding companies in the industry: BackerKit.

The entire cosmos is suddenly within reach of all humankind, without organization, authority, or limitation.  \nThis comics anthology is about what happens next.\nThe concept for FTL, Y\u2019all! was inspired by a 12-year-old RPG.net thread, which was in turn inspired by the work of Jerry Oltion. \"FTL\" is an acronym for Faster Than Light, commonly used in science fiction to describe the capabilities of warp drives.\nWith 25 stories and over 350 pages of comics, FTL, Y'all! is one of Iron Circus Comics' biggest anthologies ever. \nIron Circus Comics Kickstarter projects are fulfilled by Blackbox, a fulfillment company from the folks behind Cards Against Humanity!

Our comics are available on Webtoons, Tapas, comiXology, Amazon, and Gumroad. \nClay Adams is a writer and filmmaker who's funded three projects on Kickstarter with FRIED Comics. His directorial debut, THE BOY SCOUT, was nominated for Best Short at the Golden Egg Film Festival in Los Angeles, and his feature script, THE ECLIPSE, placed second in the horror category of the FADEIn Awards.

The Patrons is a neo-noir sci-fi comic book series. Set in Shepherd's Rest, a mega-city on the edge of an endless wasteland. With crime, corruption, and a brewing revolution, the world is balancing on a knife-edge. It's up to a lone soldier to decide which way it will fall.\nThe goal of this Kickstarter is to raise funds for issue #1 of The Patrons - 23 full color, masterfully illustrated pages (NOW 48 PAGES BECAUSE OF STRETCH GOALS). There will be three versions of issue #1. STANDARD, VARIANT, and NOIR. Variant and noir editions are unique to kickstarter and will not be available elsewhere. Any additional funds raised will go directly toward the production of further issues of the series. \nThe Patrons is illustrated by Gary Inloes and written by William Johnson and Anthony Scott. Two years ago, we quit our full time jobs to make this dream real, and response online has been amazing. We\u2019re super excited to bring the world of The Patrons to life, but we need your help. Below you can find a deeper description of the story, find comic page samples, rewards that we are offering, and more. If this is a project that you are interested in, please support our campaign and tell your friends about it.\nBecause of the support we've gotten from the Kickstarter community, we have the privilege to add stretch goals to our campaign.\nAfter plague, famine, and civil warfare brought earth\u2019s population to the brink of extinction, the Patrons provided salvation. They offered food, shelter, and technology to the survivors. All the world\u2019s natives congregated to their city, and the earth began to flourish once again.\nHowever, as society reformed, so did its sins. Crime and corruption was rampant in the city\u2019s slums, so the Patrons constructed walls to keep the natives at bay. Allowing only citizens with a pure Patron bloodline to pass through their gates.\nThe Patrons tells the story of Elliott, a low-born Patron soldier, and a mysterious assassin who hunts him. Exposed to life on both sides of the wall, Elliott must learn to live with the violence of native crime lords and the sadistic nature of the Patron\u2019s Ministry of Affairs.\nBut the further he gets pushed into a world of back-alley murders and political corruption, the more he questions which side he should be fighting for. After a leader of a cult resistance gives him a way to atone for his sins, Elliott must choose between loyalty to the Patrons, and the lives of the survivors of families that he destroyed.\nPLAY\n\nThe Noir Editions is a black and white throwback to a time of great detective fiction of the 40s.\nThis isn't simply a black and white filter placed on the final images. Each panel is hand tailored to the aesthetic and includes voiceover from Elliott (the protagonist). The Noir edition will be a different experience and include additional insights into the story.\nNiera the Snatcher, a \"Supporting\" tier character.\nWe love comic stores and are offering this special Kickstarter version of the book to retailers during the campaign. We treat retailer backers just like other backers in that they receive their rewards before the book is available anywhere else.\nIf you are a retailer, please email contact@thepatronsgn.com for more info.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our third project on Kickstarter. We haven't been mistake free, but each project's lessons have built upon the last. We are very confident that the risks in making our book are very low, and we will be able to deliver all rewards in a timely manner.\n\nThat being said, this Kickstarter is production and print, that's a big project. And the bigger the project, the more chance there is for things to go wrong. Our team will work around the clock to fix these issues, and as a backer we will always keep you in the loop as to what is going on.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "Digital", "descp": "Digital copy of The Patrons: Part One.\nINCLUDES:\nDigital Comic Download", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Aug 2018"}], "stat": ["428 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 15 or more", "title": "Standard", "descp": "Physical copy of The Patrons: Part One with a Standard cover and two 6x10 Art Prints.\nAlso includes \"Digital\" tier rewards.\nINCLUDES:\nStandard Comic Print\n6x10 Art Print (2x)\nDigital Comic Download", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Aug 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["289 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 25 or more", "title": "Variant", "descp": "Physical copy of The Patrons: Part One with a Variant cover and with your name added to the \"Thank You\" section of the book.\nAlso includes \"Standard\" tier rewards.\nINCLUDES:\nVariant Comic Print\nStandard Comic Print\n6x10 Art Print (2x)\nDigital Comic Download\nSpecial Thanks in Book", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Aug 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["295 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 40 or more", "title": "Noir Slim", "descp": "Physical copy of The Patrons: Part One in a Limited Edition, Noir print.\nAlso includes \"Variant\" tier rewards.\nINCLUDES:\nNoir Comic Print\nVariant Comic Print\nStandard Comic Print\n6x10 Art Print (2x)\nDigital Comic Download\nSpecial Thanks in Book", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Aug 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["106 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 50 or more", "title": "Noir", "descp": "Physical copy of The Patrons: Part One in a Limited Edition, Noir print, a 11x17 Art Print, and a Behind the Scenes digital download, with unused art, storyboards, and more.\nAlso includes \"Variant\" tier rewards.\nINCLUDES:\nNoir Comic Print\n11x17 Art Print\nBehind the Scenes Download\nVariant Comic Print\nStandard Comic Print\n6x10 Art Print (2x)\nDigital Comic Download\nSpecial Thanks in Book", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Aug 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["153 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 100 or more", "title": "Deluxe", "descp": "18x24 Art Print and everything from \"Noir\" tier rewards.\nINCLUDES:\n18x24 Art Print\nNoir Comic Print\n11x17 Art Print\nBehind the Scenes Download\nVariant Comic Print\nStandard Comic Print\n6x10 Art Print (2x)\nDigital Comic Download\nSpecial Thanks in Book", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Aug 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["29 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 200 or more", "title": "Super Deluxe", "descp": "A signed script of The Patrons: Part One, with a one of a kind, Pencil Sketch Cover.\nAlso includes everything from \"Deluxe\" tier rewards.\nINCLUDES:\nPencil Sketch Cover Signed Script\n18x24 Art Print\nNoir Comic Print\n11x17 Art Print\nBehind the Scenes Download\nVariant Comic Print\nStandard Comic Print\n6x10 Art Print (2x)\nDigital Comic Download\nSpecial Thanks in Book", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Aug 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["19 backers", "Limited (6 left of 25)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 5,000 or more", "title": "Featured", "descp": "Become immortalized and have a very important character in the series based upon your likeness.

Sounds great, except for one little catch: the souls you kill live on in a prison inside your head. As if that wasn't bad enough, what if the person you kill happens to be someone you care about? And what defines evil anyway?\nIn volume one we followed Ada Mansfield: a single mom and hard working attorney who stumbled upon the curse and had her whole life turned upside down as she learned who her friends and enemies were...the hard way.  Now in volume two she discovers there may be someone who can break the curse once and for all, but it comes at a price. Ada is tasked with doing terrible things for the greater good, and I can assure you NO ONE is safe in this second volume that is high on suspense and thrills.\n(Hey, if you're brand new to the series and want to read issue one for free, click https://www.dropbox.com/s/spxjhtlo9xz1a2c/Touching%20Evil%201%20PDF%20Comixology.pdf?dl=0 )\nOne of seven covers from the issues!\nTHE BOOK!\nIt's what we're all here for, so let's talk details! The book is almost exactly the same specs as volume one: a beautiful hardcover with cover art by Tom Kelly, story and art by me with colors by Kanila Tripp, and clocking in around 240 pages! Here's a mock up of what it will look like:\nMock up of the book!\nI'm thrilled to say that the foreword is written by actor Dan Fogler!!! (Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them and the upcoming sequel The Crimes of Grindelwald, Fanboys, Balls of Fury) And once again, I have been fortunate to lock in some AMAZING artists to contribute pinups for the back of the book!\nThere will once again be an epilogue not featured in the original issues, and a Thank You Section for anyone who pledges at the hardcover level or higher!\nMore art from The Phantom Limb!\nREWARDS! I am so excited about these!\n- THE BEARDO COMICS CHALLENGE COIN! Measuring 1.5,\u201d it\u2019s a special bonus to let people know you\u2019re down with Beardo Comics.

If they CAN, the challenger\u2019s buying!  \n - TAROT DECK! One of the main characters in Volume 2 uses a tarot deck, so I had to start drawing a LOT of tarot cards! It got to the point where I realized I was pretty close to making a full deck. So I did! It's 78 cards, 22 Major Arcana and 56 Minor cards, all drawn by me with excellent case art by Andrew Dimitt!\nMock up of the deck and some of the cards!\n - REMARQUED BOOKS!

The tpb collection is out through IDW, but the digital rights still belong to us so we thought we should repackage it into a newer, better, faster, stronger version for people who might want to find it in pixels and cannot.\nAs such, this isn't just the miniseries, but this is a wild and massive Digital Omnibus Edition that's going to collect a whole mess of other stuff. If you are a process junkie, or interested in more than just the story on the page, then this is most definitely for you!\nThis series was also the first collaboration of the team behind this year's huge graphic novella release from Black Mask Studios, ETERNAL.

The book might be about responsibility, and the choices we make, but it's also got dog-headed bartenders, spontaneous tidal waves, and a boat made out of dead bodies.\n\"Lindsay has created a world where anything can happen.

The story, all the extras, all the pretty horses. It's good value, but it's also a beast of a file.

The entire team behind Something Real has put a whole bunch o' hard work into it. Here are some details about the full issue:\nPage Count - 32 (28 pages of story + 4 cover pages)\nBinding - Saddle Stitch (staples)\nSize - Standard Comic (6.625\" x 10.25\")\nPaper - Cover (80# gloss cover) / Interiors (60# uncoated text)\nSomething Real #1 (Covers A & B)\nThe COVERS for Issue #1\nCover A - Ian Miller (inks) & M. Wayne Miller (colors)\nCover B (Signed Variant Cover) - Ian Miller (inks & colors)\nIt is \"SOMETHING REAL\" and it will NOT be denied\nIts kind is despised around the world. Feared by all, but mostly by children. These creatures have been around since the beginning of time, so it seems. Lurking in the darkness, perhaps from which they were born. Surely conceived in the darkest shadows of creation's first days. Whatever their origin may be, one thing is certain...\nSomething is always watching and it's most definitely real. Not all children are watched, but the majority are. Some are scared, some are brave, and some are smart. The imaginative kind are the most attractive. That's what makes young Phillip so appealing.\nPhillip is different, wiser, stronger -- with an imagination that can't be matched. He doesn't see this -- but the boogeyman can. Will Phillip's imagination become the final piece to the boogeyman's centuries-long puzzle -- finally completing the construction of its very own world -- one that's capable of completely engulfing ours?\nMAIN CHARACTERS from the series\nPHILLIP HASTEN - A young boy with an incredibly gifted imagination. Phillip must stop the boogeyman's destructive quest for power over our world while also saving the lives of those he loves most.\n\"SOMETHING REAL\" - A dangerous and reluctant boogeyman spirit that's haunted Phillip's bloodline for generations. He nears the completion of his masterful world-building project, one that could ultimately threaten our very existence on Earth.\nBENJAMIN HASTEN - Phillip's long-lost father. Banjamin left his family a couple of years back for unknown reasons. This mysterious disappearance, among many others, could soon be explained with the arrival of the boogeyman.\nSome of the cool stuff that's available through our campaign! Give 'em a glance or two, and if you like anything, check in with our Reward Tiers (neatly listed below) and see if you can't make it yours!\nThe Books - Our two covers for SOMETHING REAL #1 are available in both print and PDF formats. Cover B is signed by the writer/creator of the series and is limited to just 100 copies. THE HOLSTERED HEATHEN #1 is a work-in-progress title from the same creative team. This preview, which is available in both formats as well, will feature the first 7 completed pages of the book. A Kickstarter campaign is loosely planned to launch at the end of April for this book.\nAwesomeness - The three character prints feature three separate main characters from SOMETHING REAL.The t-shirt reward offers backers the choice between two design options, coming in several different sizes (and colors upon request). An autographed script of SOMETHING REAL #1 from the series writer/creator will also be offered.\nMore Awesomeness - A limited poster featuring the cover art of SOMETHING REAL #2 is available and comes with a signature from the writer/creator of the series. Series artist/letterer, Ian Miller is also offering commission requests for those who back the \"Simple (Boogey)Man\" or \"Rare Ruins\" Reward Tiers. These options allow the backer to request any one character portrait of his/her choosing.\n A neat collection of all the goodies that you can acquire through our various Reward Tiers!\n                ADD-ON Items\nThese Add-Ons can be obtained by those who have claimed/have yet to claim the \"Limited Sleep\" Reward Tier, and would like additional merchandise that isn't directly offered through this specific tier.\nHow to claim Add-Ons:\n1.

He enjoyed DJing \"so bad, its good\" 80s music and traveling throughout Europe and the Caribbean. He was a quarter-finalist in the ASA Screenwriter's Competition and wrote 8 feature length screenplays, 3 of which, he and Geoff collaborated on. The Scientists was the last project they worked on together. \nWhat the critics are saying about The Scientists!\nStriking a pose with my friend Ho, at the comic convention\nI began The Scientists over 10 years ago with my friend Trent Beckett. Everyone who knew him was devastated by his death in 2007, but I\u2019ve found that working on this comic has helped me to maintain a feeling of connection and I promised myself that I would finish it as a way to honor him.\nWhy Kickstarter?\nI've previously helped publish several anthology comics, but now I'm bringing my first large scale project to kickstarter to fund the printing of physical copies and to try and maximize the potential audience I can reach. I\u2019ve already put in years of work into this comic because I really believe this is a great story the whole world needs to see!\nIf you've read this far, you have probably self-identified as someone who is interested in this type of story. I will only be able to print enough copies to meet the demand, which means this campaign might be the only place you can get it. So lets make this thing happen together!\n-- What will the funds be used for?\nThe book is finished and ready to go so all the funds raised through this campaign will go towards printing, shipping, rewards, and campaign expenses. \nHow the funds will be used\nYou want to get a sneak preview? \nI will email you the first 32 pages for free right now!\nThanks for checking out The Scientists.

The fifty-two page first issue launched on Kickstarter last year and thanks to our amazing backers, quickly became the best reviewed Coal Mining Fantasy/Horror/ Forbidden Romance tale of all time. (Yes, we know we\u2019re the only C.M.F.H.F.R. comic, but still, check out these reviews.) If you\u2019re a fan of Supernatural, Twin Peaks or Lord of the Rings, you\u2019re going to love getting to know our mysterious town.\nThis campaign is to raise funds to print Chapter Two and hopefully hit a couple of Stretch Goals. (We have some incredible ones lined up that we\u2019re dying to tell you about.)\nWelcome to White Ash, a small smudge of a mining town in Western Pennsylvania, where the secrets are buried even deeper than the coal under the mountain.\nIn Chapter One, we met Aleck who's been counting down the hours till he can get the hell out of town and head off to college.\nBut an accident at the coal mine stalls his exit, setting him down a life-altering path.\nOne that brings him into the orbit of the enigmatic Lillian Alden. \nThere's a natural chemistry between the two... some would even call it HOT. But not as hot as Thane Alden's burning rage would be if he found out Aleck was spending time with his daughter.\nAnd Thane is only one of the many dangers that Aleck's forbidden flirtation has brought. For Lillian has her own secret agenda... an agenda that may get Aleck killed. \nAlong his dangerous path, Aleck uncovers a secret about his family that changes everything he knows about himself, the people around him, and the town of White Ash.\nAnd that was only the first issue. In Chapter Two the curtains really get pulled back on what's going on in the town. So now let's take a spoiler-free look at a couple of pages from White Ash: Chapter Two.\nBut, Shhhhhh, don't tell anyone we showed these to you.\n    Okay, that's it. We hope you enjoyed that little taste. What's that, you want some more? Well, thanks to the White Ash Chamber of Commerce, we have a short \"get to know our town\" video. True, it's a bit dated, but it should give you a good sense of what life is like in our idyllic little mining community.\nPLAY\n\nWhat? You still need to see more before you pledge? You do? Well, okay, you can download a 25 page ashcan of Chapter One HERE.  \nMoney raised will go toward artist fees, printing, backer rewards and shipping of the second issue. And if we're lucky enough to surpass our goal, any additional funding will go towards creating new rewards or be put directly back into the book in the form of additional pages, and production of future issues. No one is looking to get rich here. (Otherwise we wouldn't be doing comics. Really, we wouldn't.) We just want to ensure that we can produce an amazing high-quality comic book series that our backers will enjoy for years to come.\nThese books are HUGE.  There's too much story in White Ash to contain it in 22 page issues. Chapter One was a 52 page beast. Chapter Two is 32 pages long. And that kind of content deserves a premium paper weight.  \nWe print White Ash on a heavy 85 lb glossy paper stock with a 105 lb glossy cover. When you pick up one of our books, you'll feel the White Ash difference.\nThis campaign we have a special Valentine's Day Variant Cover -- a tip of the cap to the Secret Romance comics of the 60's, drawn by Conor with colors by Fin Cramb. Only 300 of these will be printed and they will ONLY be sold on Kickstarter.\n    We know what it's like to open up a package and find a mangled Kickstarter comic inside. We pack our books with care that we used in making the book and the love that we have for our backers.\nEach comic is bagged, double-boarded and sent in stay-flat packaging. Made in White Ash means everything from the content, to the mailer we use, meets our standards of quality.\n We this time around we have a virtual treasure trove of loot, starting with...\n             Stretch Goal #1 ($8,500) A Big Thank You.\n As a sign of our appreciation we\u2019re going send every backer who\u2019s getting a physical reward, a 6x9 print of this gorgeous thank you illustration drawn by White Ash's own Conor Hughes.\nStretch Goal #2 ($9,500) Supersize Me.\n We\u2019re super-sizing the deluxe PDF of Chapter Two. There will be even more of how Conor and Fin break down drawing and painting a page. We\u2019re included the full script that Charlie wrote, with annotations on how he approaches a scene. If you got our deluxe version of Chapter One, this will be like that\u2026 on steroids.\nStretch Goal #3 ($10,500) Stuck on you.\nEveryone pledging at the physical reward level will receive one of these spiffy White Ash tree logo magnets. The only question is do you like them better in color\u2026\nOR classic black and white.\nBackers can vote and make their choice known.\n Stretch Goal #4 ($12,000) NICK ROBLES VARIANT COVER.\n Nick's bringing his amazing talent from IDW, BOOM and VAULT to White Ash to do an exclusive Kickstarter VARIANT COVER for our backers. Everyone who pledging at the BOTH COVERS level or higher, will get one N.R. variant cover added to their haul for FREE. And if you pledge at the Variant Cover tier, you\u2019ll have a choice between our V-Day cover and whatever the man who did this\u2026\n...comes up with for White Ash: Chapter Two. These variants are Kickstarter exclusives and will NOT be offered again. We are only be printing up enough for our fabulous backers. So if you want one, make sure you\u2019re pledged at tier that includes them.\nStretch Goal #5 ($14,00) TRADE ME PLEASE\n We\u2019re printing up a set of four White Ash Trading Cards featuring our favorite residents. All backers who pledged at The Book Tier will get one randomly selected card. Everyone who pledged at a higher tier will get the whole set. Conor and Fin are going to design some new artwork, exclusive to the cards. They\u2019re going to the ultimate White Ash collectable.\nAnd seeing as we hit 14K with 40 hours left to go, we're going to see how big we can make the card set. So for every additional $500 we raise, we\u2019ll add another card to the set. So at $14,500 we\u2019ll do 5 cards\u2026 at $15,000 we\u2019ll do six\u2026 and so on.\nAnd if we hit 15K, EVERY BACKER getting a physical reward, will get the full set of cards (whatever the number).  So tell your friends that there's even more White Ash to be had.\nAnd thank you again for all the support for our project.  We're thrilled that you want to be part of what we're building. It means the world to us.\n   ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe learned a lot from our first Kickstarter. Even though we did our best to ship our rewards on schedule, in the end we were a little delayed when it came to delivery. This was due to underestimating how long it would take to make 52 pages (Chapter One was a beast) and our books literarily missing the boat that was supposed to take them across the ocean.\n\nThis time around we changed one huge piece of the puzzle, the book is done. 100% complete. So as soon as the KS funds, it\u2019s off to the printer. PDF copies should be in everyone\u2019s hands within a couple of weeks of the campaign ending.\n\nSure, there\u2019s always a chance there could be another delay. Things happen. Have you watched Hitchcock\u2019s The Birds? You do not want to screw with an animal that can dive bomb your head with a beak and talons. So, that being said, if our suppliers are dealing with a feathery situation, we promise to keep you apprised and let you know if the timetable changes. We want all our backers to be part of White Ash for a long time. To us, we see this as the beginning of a beautiful relationship. And if you've actually read all this, it seems that relationship has already begun.

Making waves and alerting the wrong people to their efforts nearly cost them their lives.\nNow, the case takes them to Austria to seek out the next piece to this chaotic puzzle of murder and mayhem they've found themselves wrapped up in.\nFans of mystery and suspense stories will love Pneumatic Cases!\nGears, pistons and automatons!\nIf you like a little Science Fiction tossed in with your Steampunk fare, this book is for you!\nTravel across the European landscape with the Ravenscrofts as they track down a murderer!\n22 exciting interior pages of story! \nRated T for Teen.\nSTRETCH GOALS\nHere are some extra items we cooked up we thought you might enjoy! More to come if we happen to get there!\nThis first one is now unlocked! A variant cover inspired by Scooby Doo of our cast by CrankRats artist Katherine Ellis! Digital backers will get a digital copy of PC #2 with this cover, and physical backers will get a physical copy of PC #2!\n As I announced in an update, the cover we've used throughout the campaign is a placeholder. The actual cover, by the same series artist, Rowel Roque, is equally impressive, just not colored yet. Now that we reached this one, digital and physical backers will get a mini-print of the image digitally or physically respectively!\nOur third stretch goal is a set of three (3) Pneumatic Cases buttons for all physical level backers!\nADD-ONS\nYou can add these additional items to your pledge amount with no extra shipping costs! These are for physical copy backers. If you'd like to add-on to a digital tier, there will be a shipping cost added. Keep that in mind!\nTHE CAST\nLord Rupert Percival Ravenscroft, Percy for short, is a stylish but disheveled man in his mid 30s. When he's not solving crimes with his lovely bride Annie, he can be found toiling away in his lab and naming common household appliances with unnecessarily long and complicated titles. Percy is openly loving and affectionate to his wife and is a bonafide genius. He created their majordomo Pneuman.\nLady Anastasia Elizabeth Ravenscroft, Annie for short, is a forward thinker for her time. She's brazen and outspoken, yet classy and aluring. She doesn't take too kindly to being told what a woman's place is and she'll let you know about it. She is in her late 20s and adores her intelligent husband, though she keeps him on his toes. An inventor in her own right, Annie's creations are small, elegant and powerful, with simple names to match.\nTHE TEAM\nTHE BUZZ\nTHE WHY\nJohn Wilson, the creator and writer of Pneumatic Cases (PC), and one of the founding members of Last Ember Press is an avid Steampunk fan as well as a fan of Holmesian murder mysteries. PC is a book he was working on for years trying to get off the ground before LEP was formed. It became one of our two launch titles and remains one of our best sellers online and at conventions.\nThe reason we have turned to Kickstarter for this issue is to fund printing costs and get Pneumatic Cases #2 into the hands of eager readers as soon as possible. The pencils and inks are complete, and the coloring and lettering is underway! \nWith Make/100 returning, we thought it would be a great opportunity to offer a cool and unique limited item to celebrate and commemorate the release of this issue.\nWHAT THE FUNDS WILL BE USED FOR\nSince the pencils and inks are done, and as we are currently coloring and lettering the remainder of the issue in-house (as you read this!), we are looking to use the Kickstarter funds to pay for the printing and shipping costs and the various other expenses that go with a comic project. You can see the breakdown below:\nPREVIEW THE BOOK!\n          THE REWARDS\nMake/100\nFor our part in Kickstarter's Make/100 promotion, we present this limited edition, one-of-a-kind clear charm featuring Lord and Lady Ravenscroft in a heart-shaped steampunk magnifying glass surrounded by hearts and roses! See the tiers below for details on how to get this exclusive charm!\nTiers\nExtras\nExtras As we reach certain milestones in the campaign, we are adding these additional rewards to the packages backers will receive! We have two that go to ALL backers and two that just go to backers at physical levels.\nTHE PLAN\nHere's a projected timeline for completion of the book, though we do expect it to be done sooner!\nTHANK YOU!\nOn behalf of John, Rowel, Lisa, myself and everyone with Last Ember Press, we can't thank you enough for your all your continued support! This issue has been a long time coming and we can't wait to get it in your hands sooner than later!\nAnd we sincerely hope you enjoy this one-of-a-kind Kickstarter exclusive, limited edition Pneumatic Cases charm!

Any additional funds will go directly towards the production of further issues of the series. \nGlow takes place in a world where magic catalyzed both industrial revolution and nuclear holocaust. Half a millennia ago, an ancient and powerful empire known as Nymera developed a means to channel and store magical energy into a sticky blue substance known as anima, storing them into massive Towers across the world.\n With the aid of the Towers, the Nymerans brought peace and paradise into the world. Until one day the Towers fell.\nThe story of Glow takes place two hundred years after that cataclysmic event, and follows the story of those who remain.\nIssue One introduced us to Caszy and Koken, siblings scavengers of the Wastes with extraordinary abilities.\nIssue Two continues the story as the witch Myra makes a compelling proposition.\nVariant Cover illustrated by Melissa Pagluica. Image links to her website.\nMagic in Glow is channeled through the language of ancient Nymera, the former masters of the world. In order to flesh out this cornerstone of the story, we've been collaborating with Colm Doyle, an Estonian linguist and enthusiastic conlanger.\nNymeran is used a number of ways in the comic, including sound effects. \nEach digital edition of Glow comes with a language guide that teaches you the secrets of ancient Nymeran. \nRay Chou and Vincenzo Ferriero are the writers and creators of Glow. Together, they\u2019re the founders of the creative imprint known as Mythopoeia. Glow is their second comic book series after the the dieselpunk airship adventure Skies of Fire. Ray is based in Los Angeles and Vince in London.\nAnny Maulina is an artist from Indonesia and creator of the webcomic Raruurien. She also enjoys working on comic and art projects on her spare time. You can find her on Patreon and DeviantArt. \nDia Ja was born in Iloilio City, Philippines and moved to California with her family. She graduated at Los Angeles County High School for the Arts in 2014, and is currently attending ArtCenter College of Design for Illustration. Check out her tumblr.\nBryan Valenza is an artist based in Jakarta, Indonesia. He currently occupies his time coloring various projects, including Skies of Fire and Witchblade. @bryan_valenza\nBorn in Barcelona, Cristian Docolomansky Cerda (C.D.C.) is an inker and letterer based in Chile. He's worked with several publishers such as Alterna Comics, IDW, and Ariete Producciones. You can find him here.\nFrom Ireland, Colm \u00d3 D\u00faill is a verification specialist at TransferWise's office in Tallinn, Estonia, where he has lived since 2007. He holds an M.Phil. in Applied Linguistics and a B.Comm with French, and is pursuing a Ph.D. in Linguistics. He is married with two children, and has been dabbling in creating constructed languages since 2005; Nymeran is his first developed constructed language.\nKendrick See is a full time concept artist and illustrator from Malaysia. He is currently working in the video game industry, and his job scope ranges from creating various idea development pieces, to breakdowns and 3D paintovers. He helped bring Shoddai to life with a map! http://sourshade.deviantart.com/\nGiulia Frontoni is an Italian illustrator based in Rome with a focus on creature designs. She helped bring to life many of the beasts found in Glow, as well as the postcards and button pinups! http://nondev.deviantart.com/\nAlexandur Bucur is an architect and illustrator with an interest in history and military hardware of all kinds. When not at his drawing table he can be found standing at attention in a swanky uniform for the benefit of the Military Traditions branch of the Romanian Army. He helped bring together many of the technological designs found in Glow. http://wingsofwrath.deviantart.com/\nOfficial Glow T-Shirt design by Anny Maulina.

Last year we had a lot of issues regarding our manufacturers, and the lesson we took at the end of it all was that we need to be better.\n\nFor 2018, we want to ship our projects in as timely a manner as possible. We've set a deadline for this project of April and think we can wrap everything up by then. The only new manufacturing needed for this Kickstarter are the print copies for #2 as well as some runic pendants. Everything else is in stock and ready to go.\n\nWe'll do our best to improve our logistics, but are also committed to top quality customer support. If you ever have an issue, please let us know and we'll do our best to fix it. You can ask our previous backers - we do our best to make sure they're 100% satisfied.\n\nAt the end of the day, Mythopoeia is just Vince and Ray. We both have full time jobs outside of comics, but we're passionate about what we do and are committed to grow.

They're afraid of the light, of people, of each other, of being found out, and of dying again.\nCatherine Morrison has spent the better part of 900 years walking the line between humans and vampires...protecting her people from the worst of humanity and humanity from the worst of her people.\nShe is loved, feared, and sometimes even hated, but she's never been hunted.\nUntil now.\nDiary of Night Volume 1 - Distant Thunder\nSoftcover - 130 pages\n - Collects Diary of Night #'s 1, 2, 3, & 4\n - Includes Pin-ups\n - Includes 4 New Diary Entries\n - 85 lb. stock\n\nHardcover contains 16 Bonus pages of Behind the Scenes material.\nCampaign Exclusives include digital rewards, bookmarks, postcards, prints, signed bookplates, and even participation in the creation of new content for this collection.\n  Will Allred is a writer, professor, and technologist.

Gene works in both digital and traditional mediums. He has created artwork for business training, graphic facilitation, primary, secondary and higher education text books, comic books, movies, and licensing.\nRus Wooton is a veteran letterer who has worked for Image Comics, Marvel Comics, Radical Comics, Archaia, and Dark Horse Comics. In addition, he is a freelance illustrator, graphic designer, and cartoonist.  \nDiary of Night needs to be available in print again as a collected edition not only because I'm proud of the work we did, but also to provide resources to fund more comics projects. We need these resources to continue creating more projects that matter to us, thought-provoking projects that involve literature, art, history, science, math, and technology that will inspire, educate, and entertain.\nWe're coming to Kickstarter to help raise funds for a large offset print run of at least 1000 copies of the Diary of Night Volume 1 softcover and at least 200 copies of the hardcover.\nThe book is 100% complete and ready to go to print.

Expect the book at your front door within the month! \nKickstarter is a worldwide crowd funding platform that helps artists and creators fund their projects. You will not be charged until after the funding period is over, which is typically within 7 days of the end of a project.  The next step will be sending the finalized files to the printer overseas, who will begin the printing process. The longest part is yet to come, however, since shipping takes a few weeks, by boat.

Lettering. It is harder than you would think, honestly, and it is time consuming. So please accept our apologies, since we will probably not have the copies out to you by April as we first thought, but it will be probably closer to July.

She takes the fight to them, via her diplomatic sell out sister, and she fails.\nOr does she?\nWhat comes next is a wild ride of spacesuit noir that's my take on a 70s revenge flick with our wandering hero loose in space.\nThis comic is 100% made and completely ready to deliver.\nAlex Cormack is amazing. The world recently lost their mind over his work on SINK, with John Lees through ComixTribe, and his work on this comic is superb as he brings gristle and emotion to the page.\nHassan Otsmane-Elhaou letters with the style that's making him a stadium-filling favourite across all the continents.\nDan Hill edits his ass off to make this a better book. He is smart, has edited most of my other creator owned books, and his name is quickly becoming a signifier of sharp erudition.\nAnd I'm Ryan K Lindsay, and I've written what were hopefully some of your favourite indie miniseries of the past few years - BEAUTIFUL CANVAS with Sami Kivela at Black Mask, NEGATIVE SPACE with Owen Gieni at Dark Horse, and HEADSPACE with Eric Zawadzki at Monkeybrain/IDW.\nI have also previously run 5 successful comic Kickstarter campaigns, raising ~$20,000 across 3 years on this platform, I've yet to fail, and I always deliver. Sometimes I even over-deliver by rolling out unlocked rewards and stretch goals just because you're amazing.\nALL DIGITAL, ALL THE TIME\nThis campaign is an all-digital, all-singing, all-dancing affair. You can purchase the PDF of StSS here, there will be no print copies available as a basic tier [kinda, maybe].\nYou can get the PDF, as well as upsized PDFs, audio content, and we keep it simple like this because shipping books outta Australia is a logistical nightmare, and also because with a PDF we can make it as many extra pages as we want to. So this helps both me and you.\nAlthough, there are some actual 'irl rewards' on offer. You can buy original art, or annotated scripts, and a special Variant Cover Print Copy will be unlocked [see below for more details].\n~~~~~FIRST DAY BACKER PARTY~~~~~\nTo say thank you to everyone who already follows me, and came into the campaign early, which helps spread the word, I wanted to thank you all and reward you all, so here's the deal: all first day backers will get downloads at the end of that day for:\nOXYMORON: THE LOVELIEST NIGHTMARE #1 from Alex Cormack and John Lees\nHEADSPACE #1 from Eric Zawadzki and Ryan K Lindsay\nCHUM #1 from Sami Kivela and Ryan K Lindsay\n~~~~~~~PLEDGE LEVELS~~~~~~~\nHere's the important stuff, what can you get, and how much will it set you back.

How many comics and cartoons have you seen where the cat chases the mouse endlessly, rarely catching him and never succeeding in vanquishing his rodent nemesis? In the world of BOO & HISS, that all changes: Hiss (the cat) catches Boo (the mouse) and DEVOURS him. There\u2019s no coming back from that, right? WRONG! That\u2019s where the story really begins! Boo returns as a ghost to enact vengeance on his feline murderer. \nWherever Hiss goes, Boo follows, tormenting him in various ways: nearly scaring him to death, possessing his body and making him do terrible and embarrassing things, and just generally making his life a living hell. The cat becomes the hunted and the ghost mouse the hunter in the twisted, comic, scary, and poignant world of BOO & HISS! \nCheck out 7 pages of BOO & HISS below, written by Paul Dini with art by Dave Alvarez. And then get ready for the graphic novel, which will be overflowing with cat-astrophic calamities and mouse-y mayhem!\nOne of several potential covers for the graphic novel (non-KS exclusive version)\n  Who Is Paul Dini?\nAs the fervent followers of the Emmy and Eisner Award-winning Paul Dini know, he\u2019s been a writer and/or producer on some of the greatest projects in cartoons, TV, and comics in the last few decades. Here\u2019s just a sampling: Tiny Toon Adventures, Batman: The Animated Series, Superman: The Animated Series, Batman Beyond, Justice League, Freakazoid!, and Lost. He was also the writer of the blockbuster video games Batman: Arkham Asylum and Batman: Arkham City. Dini recently wrote the #1 New York Times bestseller Dark Night: A True Batman Story. And if you\u2019re a fan of the Joker\u2019s madcap gal pal, Harley Quinn, well, Paul Dini co-created her too!  \nPaul Dini\nWho Is Dave Alvarez?  \nEven the greatest graphic novel story in the world won\u2019t fly if the art isn\u2019t up to snuff. Thankfully, in the case of BOO & HISS, the art is spectacular, due to the tremendous talents of David Alvarez. His eye-catching drawings for the graphic novel are reminiscent of classic cartoons and comics, providing a douse of nostalgia while illustrating the brand-new world of BOO & HISS. David Alvarez\u2019s past work includes the Looney Tunes and Animaniacs comic books. He is also the creator of the internationally popular comic strip Yenny.\nDave Alvarez\nWhy Kickstarter?\nDue to all of the amazing work he has done, Paul Dini has a lot of fans. There are literally Dini fans of every age, gender, and race. However, it can be REALLY difficult to reach all those fans using the traditional publishing model. Plus, even for Paul Dini, it\u2019s not that easy to get publishers behind a brand-new project no one has heard of yet. \nSo, he decided to go directly to his fans. Kickstarter is the perfect place to go to get the word out and reach tons of the Dini supporters out there. Plus, we know there are comics fans on Kickstarter who will love the originality and eye-catching style of BOO & HISS! \nIf you\u2019re familiar with the work of Paul Dini, you know the quality of work he ALWAYS produces. So, backers, you better be ready: You\u2019re going to get something whimsical and wonderful with BOO & HISS. \nWho (or What) Is Erasmus Fox? \nErasmus Fox is an entertainment company dedicated to working with talented creators to bring their projects to life.

The virus brainwashes office workers into becoming bloodthirsty psychopathic maniacs intent solely on causing harm to everyone around them. As this is unfolding, a window cleaner named Frankie Barrett gets himself trap at the top of the skyscraper and his only option to get out of trouble is to break into the building from outside. Cue Frankie finding out very quickly what is occurring in the building and having to figure out how he is going to escape alive. Action, horror and dark humour combine to give this title a full throttle paced adventure that we hope will thrill readers everywhere!\nPREVIEW OF THE BOOK\nThe nefarious Maxwell Dutch executing his plan!\n  Frankie Barrett coming face to face with his first challenge...\n  Anyone for golf?\n  Can Frankie piece together what's happening before it's too late? Find out what is really going on by backing our campaign!\nTHE PEOPLE BEHIND THE PROJECT\nRichard Allan (R) Greg Liddle (Centre) , Tommy Cree (Left)\nThe team behind Levels consisted of writers Richard Allan and Greg Liddle, penciller Karl Engracia, inker Nathan Allison, letterer Toben Racicot and additional end product consultancy by Tommy Cree.\nRichard and Greg are based in Edinburgh, Scotland and have been writing together since 2013. Both are ardent comic book fans and intend to carry on writing together in future. With Levels issues two and three already written, they plan to go back and finish off their first series, 'The Plight'.\nKarl Engracia is based in the Phillipines. Karl has a strong track record of penciling for various projects, one of which is Desert Whale Comics' very own 'Levels' run. Incredibly detailed and painstakingly accurate, Karl brought the script's ideas to life by crafting beautiful work throughout.\nNathan Allison is an artist and musician based just outside of Edinburgh, Scotland and, incredibly, Levels was the first comic book project he has undertaken. Nathan added depth, colour and a huge amount of innovative ideas to the table throughout. He will be inking Levels issues two and three, with two already underway.\nToben Racicot is based in Canada. Precise and easy to work with, Toben produced letters for Levels in a very short time frame, producing excellent work throughout. \nTommy Cree is based in Edinburgh, Scotland and is a freelance comic book artist in his spare time. Tommy is the sole illustrator for our first comic, 'The Plight', and is currently illustrating the second issue.\nPublished by Rats & Crows Publishing: ''Our mission: To be a publishing agency that rewards the merit of creators and honors its responsibilities to them.

This campaign is specifically for the funding the creation Issues 8 and 9, which will complete Volume1. That means MOST of the book is already complete. I only have about 50 pages to go out of the 225+ pages in the series.\nNew to the story? Not to worry!  All of Volume 1 is available in this campaign. Also Issues 8 and 9 will be of course available as well for those who have already been following along.\nThanks to the lovely and amazing Kickstarter community I've had Issues 2 - 7 funded on previous campaigns. This project began years ago and has slowly turned into something I am really devoted to and would love to work on for years to come.\nGIRRION is a sweeping sci-fi fantasy story of a hero's journey in a distant world in a distant time. The saga is told through the eyes of Jarra, a poor factory worker who dreams of escaping his world of endless toil. His wish comes true, though not in a way he would have ever wanted, when his city is attacked by a dark entity called the Halodron. He escapes the conflict, but only to be thrust into a war of other-worldy magic and weaponry.\nAmidst the destruction, history begins to unravel as soldiers of a forgotten war resurface and the secrets of a mysterious technology known as Girrion come to light as its scattered remains suddenly start to \u201creawaken\u201d. With little time and resources, the hero must help save his crumbling empire from its destructive past.\n        Inking in progress\n        Volume 1 cover art in progress\n     Girrion started off as a hobby over 15 years ago. Initially it was more of an illustration portfolio than a story. I wanted to be a concept artist, so I would spend a lot of time designing characters, ships and environments.\nI didn't consider myself a writer back then, but I started getting ideas for a story. When I would draw environments or characters the ideas would just pop in my head. One scene led to another, then another etc. It took a lot of time, but the experience put in over the years not only helped the art, it also gave me time to develop the story more and give it more depth than it had in the earlier drafts.\nAge Range: (PG - PG-13 )\n- No sex or bad language\n- No excessive gore. Girrion is primarily about a war so there is cartoon violence similar to the level of Star Wars, but more of it.\n            This will be the first campaign where a full volume book is available. It will be 225+ pages in length. 6.14\" x 9.2\"\nVolume 1 mockup. Cover art and design are in progress.\n Previous campaigns single issues were available in hardcover or softcover, and these formats will be available in this campaign as well. \nSample Hardcover (Issue #7)\n Hardcover comic issues are 6\" x 9\". Grey cloth with a dust jacket. Each issue is anywhere from 22 - 26 pages in length.\nSoftcover samples (Issues 1-9)\nSoftcover comic issues are 6\"x9\" and have a glossy cover with a stock thicker than standard comics. The interior art is full color and has a watercolor feel.\nSample Character Sketch\n  Sample 4\" x 6\" print\n  How Do Add Ons Work?\nHere's what you do:\nClick \"Manage Your Pledge\" in the upper right corner (blue button) Add the total of your Add On to your pledge amount. (i.e. one Giclee Fine art print is $25.) You don't need to change the tier you've selected You are done! Later you'll get a backer survey asking how you spent your add-on dollars and for other pertinent info. Thank you!\n  Generally, about half of my expenses come from printing the books and mailing them. The other half of the budget is going into the production. Most of what this campaign money goes towards is large chunks of time for me to focus fully on the book. One issue takes me 300 - 400 hours. If I'm able to knock off some days working freelance on other jobs, the books come out much faster.\n  Scout Comics is now publishing Girrion! They released Issue 1 last October and will be releasing books up through this Fall. They are an indie publisher\u2013 very supportive of their creators and just a great group of people all around. They also have a wide range of comics which you can check out on their site. www.scoutcomics.com\nFollow\nWebsite: www.girrion.com\nTwitter: www.twitter.com/Girrion1\nInstagram: www.instagram.com/girrion1/\nFacebook: www.facebook.com/girrion1/\nMusic from Kickstarter Video: \"Night Owl\" by Broke For Free", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nBeing that this is not the first comic I've made there aren't too many major challenges with getting the book made, but there are some small ones:\n\nSome of the artwork on certain pages goes fast, some takes very long. There are some complex scenes in this issue with lots of characters and elements that need strong design. Again from past experience, the artwork can sometimes take a bit longer than expected. Also, keep in mind I have to mix this work in with the day job.\n\nI've learned a lot from previous Kickstarter campaigns, and I am getting more and more efficient. I'm also trying to find ways to make rewards as cost-effective as possible too. One way of doing this is to do more than one issue per campaign, which cuts down on mailing costs. Before it took so long to complete just one issue and I could only offer one per campaign, but now I plan on doing 2 -3 issues per campaign from now on.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 2 or more", "title": "CURIOUS ABOUT GIRRION", "descp": "-Issue 1 PDF format", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2017"}], "stat": ["27 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 4 or more", "title": "ISSUE 8 & 9 (PDF)", "descp": "Continuing the Saga!\n-Issue 8 & 9 PDF format", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2017"}], "stat": ["52 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 6 or more", "title": "CHOOSE ANY 3 ISSUES (PDF)", "descp": "-Miss an issue or want to start from the beginning?

Magic was real. Strange artifacts that can perform miraculous events, including connecting our world to others and the gods that inhabit them, can be found. Or created.\nThis is the world of Horrors, Inc.\nWhat if a few mega corporations, in cooperation with the governments of the world, kept it all from the general public? How could such a world-wide coverup exist with monsters and worse loose in the world? By those same companies employing the best minds to study the strange and weird. By enlisting the best soldiers(and killers) in the world to track the bizarre and dangerous down and \"acquire\" them. Regardless of the collateral damage.\nEnter: Squad K\nFACEBOOK                  TWITTER\nBut What is Horrors Inc: Squad K?\nHISK is a suspenseful and darkly humorous series that follows a ragtag group of mercenaries tasked with hunting down monsters, breaking up cults, and acquiring magical artifacts for one of the world's mega-corporations, Soladyne Corp. Unfortunately, Soladyne is more interested in keeping the existence of these creatures secret and exploiting them for their own gain. The comic is a mix of horror, humor, and action blended together into a fun ride as we follow one of Soladyne's containment squads. The infamous Squad K.\nBelow is your first look at the squad. Besides these first sketches, I've decided NOT to do a break down of each character. Each member of Squad K has their own unique personalities, backstories, and flaws. Instead of giving you a break down of each, I'd rather have you learn about them organically from how they act in the comic series.\nThe Squad\nThe first season of HISK is an already outlined 12 issue run, divided up into 4 \"missions\" spread out over 3 issues each. \nHorrors, Inc: Squad K - Issues #1, 2, and 3 \"The Jester\", is the first three part story that jumps us right into one such mission to capture one of the worst kinds of monsters, A Horror. Horrors are your equivalent to Michael Myers, Jason Vorhees, and Freddy Kruger. Part ghost story, part mystical legend, and all unstoppable killing machine. Issue 1 opens on a ghost hunting team unwittingly stumbling across The Jester before Squad K arrives on the scene.\nIssue 1\nPart 1 of 3 - The Jester\nStandard comic book format: 6'625\" x 10'25\"\n~44 Full-Colored Pages(Plus Interior of Cover and Back)\nRegular Cover\nThank You in the Back\nAll backers will be a part of regular updates that show off more of the story boarding process, uncolored pages, and then the finalized pages themselves.\nUpdates for ALL will include close to the first half of the comic before its complete during the campaign and then exclusively for BACKERS, the remaining pages afterwards. There will also be interactions between the author, artist, and backers as well.\nSocial Goals(explained below) could get you bumped up a tier for free!\nFirst Page\nAll backers will receive a discount on all future issues (either through retail or another Kickstarter) as an extra thank you. Those backing at the Character in the Comics levels will receive the comic of their first (and for those dying, last) appearance for free.\nThe Creative Team\nJames R. Vernon(The Writer) is just your average guy that loves comics, video games, and movies. A long job commute got his creative juices flowing, and this SuperBacker grew into the author of the Bound to the Abyss fantasy series of novels(PDF, Print, and Audio versions) and the soon to be released Horrors, Inc. novel. Now, James is applying his creative talents to writing comic books as well.\n               Twitter                    Author Facebook\n Dedy Koerniawan Soesanto is an illustrator and comic artist from Indonesia with basic autodidact and is on comic world now as he works and studies at Padepokan Ragasukma. He takes freelance work on DeviantArt under the name Dedyk.\nHis first comic, Nagasari is an action fantasy silat comic. You can read the preview atragasukma.com.\nHis other credits include being a color artist on H2o Reborn at kolamkomik.com, working on the story and art for horror comic Sinawang at ciayo.com and has his own comic project coming soon.\nThe Storyboarding Process, Page 8 and 9\nThe Costs\nWe believe in complete transparency and want to build a great relationship with our new audience, so I've included the breakdown of everything below. These are our best estimates from speaking with other creators, printers, and backers. (Feel free to imagine it in a big, fancy pie chart!)\n~$450 - 10% to Kickstarter and Processing Fees\n~$2000 - to Dedy for the remaining comic pages including interior and  exterior of the covers\n~$1700 - to print 400 copies of comic and ship them to me for redistribution\n~$500 - Packaging and Shipping of Comics and Rewards\n~$350 - production of comic sleeves, backs, bookmarks, and posters\n~$400 - to Dedy for Promotional Art and Other Rewards\nTOTAL: ~$5,350\nBUT WAIT(you may say)! THAT ADDS UP TO MORE THAN YOU'RE HOPING TO RAISE! WILL YOU NEED MORE MONEY THEN YOU ARE ASKING?\nANSWER: ABSOLUTELY NOT!\nI've put a good chunk in my own money to get the ball rolling with Dedy to produce the finished pages and all of the other artwork you'll see in the updates. I believe in this project and want to show that I'm not looking for my backers to foot the entire bill.\nThe money being asked for is to make sure we get everything finished in a timely manner, produce enough comics for our potential backers and for trade shows and whole sale, and provide the rewards to all of you!\nPage 8 Finished\n  Why Kickstarter?\nKickstarter has become a leading source for independent creators to get their work out into the world while building a fan base from the ground up. In our case, starting a brand new comic story is as daunting as it is expensive. Having our Kickstarter campaign funded allows us to;\nKeep Creative Control\nProvide an excellent avenue to keep in touch with other creative types and our potential fans\nCreate a direct route to market and sell the comic on completion\nRewards:\nAll Backers - Everyone that backs the project will have access to updates, sketches, and interactions with the author and artist. All backers names will also be placed on a special page in thank you at the back of the first issue. Each backer will also receive a discount on future issues (both retail versions and future Kickstarters.)\nBookmarks - All backers at the $10 level and up get a bookmark to mark their place.\nPDF and/or Physical Comic - The PDF and Comic are 44 hand-crafted and colored pages of goodness. The extended comic includes pages of work from sketches and inks to cover ideas.\nCover\nINDIE SUPPORT GROUP - All backers at this level will get a special mention in each Friday update for this project. This can include blurbs about your Kickstarter project(upcoming, current, or already successful) or links to your work elsewhere. Special mention if you're also a project I've backed!\nThis is just my way of further supporting some of the amazing creative talents I've seen and backed on this sight as well as others that are trying to make it on their own and with the support of the community.\n6\" x 8\" Head Sketch - A signed 6\" by 8\" sketch of a character of your choice, signed by Dedy.\nChoose One!\nPoster - An 11\" by 17\" unique poster for the comic by Dedy.\nPoster\nThe Novel - Horrors, Inc. is a sci-fi horror novel set around the end of the comic's first season. The story follows Eddie Watson, a simple, low-level janitor working at one of the most advanced pharmaceutical and tech companies in the world, Soladyne Tech. After a chance encounter with high ranking company employee Joseph Hinderlight, Eddie finds himself dragged into a fight for his life. The company comes under attack from forces that Eddie can't quite explain, but don't seem to shock the resolute Hinderlight. As they move deeper into complex where Eddie works, the company's darker secrets are revealed as the two meet others trying to survive. Can they escape the increasingly horrific monsters that now roam the building.\nHorrors, Inc. Novel\n  Becoming a Character - Like Dedy's art style? How would you like to see yourself as one of his characters? A pledge at the $75 tier gets you a professionally done character sheet of you! Even better, how would you like to be IN a future comic? Besides the character sheet you could see your comic self either, killed off at the $100 tier in a future comic or survive to appear in multiple issues as a background character at the $150 tier.\nSample Character Sheet\nNote: The men pictured below ARE NOT part of Squad K. Chances that any of them survive?\nDead meat?\nStretch Goals:\n$8,000 - Jump start the Next Issue - If we reach this goal, it means issues #2, will be published at an insanely faster rate. As we approach this goal, I'll start giving out more info on what you can expect to see next. All backers will ALSO receive versions of these issues that mirror their rewards for the first comic.\n$12,000 - The Shooting For the Stars Stretch Goal - If we reach this goal, it means issues #1, 2, and 3 will be published at an insanely faster rate. As we approach this goal, I'll start giving out more info in the next \"mission\" that Squad K undertakes in after \"The Jester\" story line in Issues #5, 6, and 7 so you know what is ahead for Squad K. All backers will receive versions of these issues that mirror their rewards for the first comic.\n\nSocial Goals:\nNothing helps a Kickstarter more than word of mouth. A fun way to assist with that is to provide rewards for reaching certain social goals. The goals and rewards that you can help achieve are listed below!\n6 Backer Goals: 100 Backers, 200 Backers, 500 Backers, 1,000 Backers, 1,500 Backers, 2,000 Backers\n4 Three Moons Realm Instagram Goals - Increase from our Pre-Kickstarter following of ##: 50 Instagram Followers, 100 Instagram Followers, 250 Instagram Followers, 500 Instagram Followers\n6 Horrors, Inc Facebook Goals: 50 Facebook Likes, 100 Facebook Likes, 500 Facebook Likes, 50 Shares of our Kickstarter Post, 100 Shares of our Kickstarter Post, 500 Shares of our Kickstarter Post\n5 Twitter Goals - Retweet of the Pinned Tweet at the top of our profile: 50 Project Retweets, 100 Project Retweets, 250 Retweets, 500 Project Retweets, 1000 Project Retweets\n\nSocial Goal Unlocks:\nThe rewards below will be chosen from the list of CURRENT backers when the goal is achieved.

You can find them attached at the hip on twitter here and here.\nRORY DONALD: Is most certainly not just a drawing. Rory is an artist based in the beautiful Cornish coastline and has had the misfortune of working with Rob and Mike before.

You can find Rory's work in Papercuts and Inkstains 2, Fly Comics and Pigs Might Surf.\nYou can find Rory on the twitter here.\nGriff Gristle is our only protection from the nightmares of the deep and it seems as though the nightmares are rising. Griff, vulnerable after the recent loss of his wife and in unchartered territory with a newly found acquaintance, is trying to unravel the increasing intensity of unexplained maritime occurrences in the area. Missing boats, unsettled spirits, underwater churches and impromptu exorcisms were just the tip of the iceberg and you won\u2019t believe what\u2019s coming next. After putting an end to the occurrences in Charlsberg, Griff and Justine have followed a lead to a cruise ship that is carrying some unauthorised and highly concerning cargo. Buckle your seatbelt for rough waters, it\u2019s time to hear THE SIREN\u2019S SONG!\nWho are the children of the waves and what do they want?\nThe Siren's Song also features a seven page Epilogue entitled Awakenings which gives readers more insight into the Children of the Waves and just what it is they want with our eponymous hero.\nDon\u2019t worry if you\u2019re a brand new reader as care has been taken to make the issue as new reader friendly as possible and everything you need to know will be explained in the book.

Thank you all so very much!\nLet's keep it going for the next 24 hours!\nStory\n\"What if you could be invisible? Would you remain moral? What if you were never moral to begin with?\"\nA fusion of a classic Invisible Man tale and a crime thriller, steeped in Sci-Fi influence. Thomas Taylor is a successful cat burglar, until he isn't...\nSet in an approximation of London in the not too distant future, our hero(?) is a cat burglar with a heart of gold, diamonds, art, or anything else that takes his fancy. While stealing a rare stone for his \u201cpatron\u201d, Lord Chaundry, a bribed security guard goes turncoat and Taylor\u2019s head ends up on the wrong side of a truncheon. \nBailed by his boss, Taylor now owes him, and Chaundry has no ethical qualms about experimenting on the thief, using the talents of the vicious nanobot engineer (and psychopath) Dr. Mann to (painfully) render him invisible.\nMission\nI\u2019ve been obsessed with science fiction since I was a little kid devouring Star Trek and reruns of old shows on terrestrial television in Ireland. One of those shows was the old British version of the Invisible Man. Irish TV in the early 90s was bursting with reruns of 50s, 60s and 70s shows. I remember watching, frozen in terror, as the invisible man unraveled his bandages.\nI\u2019ve wanted to see an Invisible man story told with a bit of humour and with a more modern bend. There\u2019s an old adage about a little red hen, who just does it herself. With this in mind, I set about writing Out of Sight. Futurism in sci-fi has always left me spellbound, and so I wanted to incorporate future science into the story. Nanotechnology is at the forefront of future tech that always seems to be right around the corner, and its possibilities are endless. Imagine nanobots that can embed themselves in your cells and refract the light around you, leaving you invisible to the naked eye. Unscientific? Perhaps. Exciting? Very.\nIf you\u2019re mesmerised by the possibilities of science and what the future holds, if you like smart-ass anti-heroes, self-referential humour, heist movies, and shady oligarchical conspiracies, then please support our upcoming Kickstarter and help us make this comic a reality!\nWhy Kickstart Out of Sight?\nToo often artists are working on comics completely unpaid. I don't have the resources to pay for a full comic and I don't want to ask artists to work for free. Both of these artists have a lot of work under their belts, so I know they can deliver the goods. By Kickstarting Out of Sight you will help pay the artists, and help publish a cool comic! \nAs featured on:\nPreview\n        Team\nNenad Cviticanin - Art & Lettering\nhttps://www.facebook.com/theartofnenadcviticanin/\nNenad is a talented artist who comes from Serbia.

These creators bring you tales from the Arctic circle to Oaxaca, both historical and contemporary.\nThe next step is to raise the money to pay for printing, shipping, and paying our contributors.

Our Standard productions already have other companies' Stretch Goals to begin with.\nAlmost every large-format game from Eagle-Gryphon Games comes with a high-quality and carefully designed plastic insert and plastic cover to conveniently, safely and securely store your components. This starting point sets us apart from the typical cardboard dividers (or sometimes lack of an insert at all) you will find in other games. We also start with 310 gsm, linen embroidery finish card stock with a special playing card varnish (a secret family recipe) for all of our playing card components. The same goes for all of our printed materials. You will consistently find that our game boards, punch boards, tiles, reference aids, etc. are the thickest and most durable that you could ask for. Our game boxes start as \"upgrades\" when compared to virtually all other game companies' boxes. This ensures that our customers can store, and transport our games with peace of mind for a long, long time.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nEagle-Gryphon Games has completed 70+ Kickstarter projects to date. All of those projects have either been completely delivered or are in production right now!\n \nEagle-Gryphon Games stands by our products. Please contact our customer service department at customer-service@eagle-gryphon.com within 30 days of receiving your pledge reward(s) if you are for any reason unsatisfied. We will take every step available to get you exactly what you purchased. We will also send you tracking information whenever possible to remain transparent throughout the delivery of your purchase.\n \nWe will always do our best through Kickstarter updates to keep you as informed as possible as to the status of your game(s). However, in this business, some uncertain and ever-changing factors are beyond our control, such as holidays, customs, quality control, inspection delays, inclement weather and dock strikes - to name a few. As you can imagine, we have little to no control over such factors. We assure you that you will be the first to know any developments as we learn them.\n \nTo put it simply, you will get everything we promise to you when you pledge to one of our Kickstarter projects, and it will be delivered to you in as timely a manner as possible.\n \nWe ship your game(s) to you via various fulfillment partners located around the world. We do this to keep expenses as low as possible and hope that you will see this change reflected in the shipping costs for our projects.\n \nWe reserve the right to combine the shipping of any and all pledges for multiple projects if the shipping runs close to the same time and we can ship them all within a reasonable time frame (30 days) of us receiving them. We will advise you as soon as possible if it looks like we will delay shipping for this reason. You will always have the right to pay additional fees to get expedited delivery on orders. \n \nShipping issues are relatively uncommon, but they do sometimes occur. We double check all of your games for damage before sending them to you. However, there is a small chance that your games may get damaged during shipping by the carrier. If your package is damaged, please contact us so we can assist you.\n \nWe will not ship to Russia, the Ukraine and certain places in Asia and the rest of the world, except for specially-made arrangements wherein the Backer takes the risk involved in receiving the package.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "How Fantastiqa!", "descp": "Thanks for your donation!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2017"}], "stat": ["29 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 3 or more", "title": "The Mystical Mina", "descp": "For backers who own Fantastiqa: Enchanted Edition and/or Fantastiqa: Rucksack Edition, and want to support the campaign on a budget.\nFREE SHIPPING!\nINCLUDES:\nMina EGGclusive Item", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Only certain countries"}], "stat": ["14 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "Retailer", "descp": "You must register and be approved as an Eagle-Gryphon Games retail network member to qualify for this level.

Thank you in advance for understanding, please pledge responsibly.\n\nKingdom Death: Monster 1.5\nKingdom Death Monster is an massive cooperative board game about survival in a nightmare-horror world. Survivors fight for their lives against an onslaught of bizarre and fearsome creatures. They will use the fruits of these battles to build a fragile civilization in a place where humans are at the bottom of a monstrous ecology. \nInitially, I brought the concept for Monster to Kickstarter in order to make a far-away dream into a reality. The runaway train of success helped pack the game with more original art, in-depth gameplay, and fantastically sculpted minis than even I dreamed of. A game this size could not feasibly be made without the community of supportive backers we found on Kickstarter. It's too expensive to produce and too vivid for distribution.\nThrough the experience of kickstarting Monster, I found a group of people that shares my vision for a blisteringly difficult game with a continually emerging story. I am truly humbled to share it with the world.\nNow there isn't a single factory sealed copy at KD HQ. There are still people asking if there will ever be more so I'm back on Kickstarter to launch a campaign for a new edition. I want to print updated rules, great new expansions, even more content and (with your help) many surprises!!!\nKingdom Death: Monster 1.5 Changelog\nAdd-Ons\n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                         The Gambler's Chest\nGambler's Rolls\n                                                                                                                                                                                                     First Hero Expansion\nIn the First Hero Expansion, players take the role of 4 veteran survivors who have no settlement to call their own. They find and invade a settlement where they face the First Hero, a survivor so powerful, they do all the hunting by themselves! The purpose of this expansion is to help players start more advanced campaigns at Lantern Year 12 or 20. Instead of simply providing complicated rules to generate later settlements, your showdown with the First Hero will create the advanced settlement that you can take over.\n Kingdom Death: Monster\nShipping Details & Shipping Waves\nOne thing we've learned from managing the impossibly huge number of reward combinations from our first campaign is to strike a balance between timely delivery of rewards to our eager fans and being logistically responsible to our staff and partners. So here's what we've decided about shipping rewards for this campaign.\n\nWe have set the estimated delivery of all pledge levels to December 2020. This is a best case scenario, in case our campaign gets insanley huge! 3-4 years development, production & transportation cycle to 100% finish every promise we might make during this campaign is realistic.  \nRewards from this Kickstarter will ship in waves that will be determined by the final scope of this campaign. Each wave's shipping costs will be collected through a pledge manager (most likely backerkit) when the goods are ready to ship. Shipping costs will reflect the actual cost to ship your pledge and any additional rewards you selected from that wave.\nLike our previous campaign, we will make our best efforts to ease the burden of shipping by fulfilling rewards from shipping partners around the world (projected as: US, CA, EU, AU.)\nBackers are responsible for any and all import fees, VAT, duties, taxes, post office fees, and or any other fees their country or government imposes.\n\n*Core Games Ships Separately!\nThe Core Game is massive.

Shipments that could not be delivered due to an inaccurately provided address (including failure to update an old address) will have additional costs to be reshipped. Due to the size of your rewards, we cannot ship to PO Boxes.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI learned a lot about manufacturing a top-quality boutique game and fulfilling it to our backers from our first Kickstarter. Not all my lessons were easy, but all of them were meaningful. Trying to bring such a staggeringly large game to life, we worked insane hours, fought lots of battles, and saw some unexpected setbacks. It's taught me how to look for ways to turn logistical, artistic, and fiscal difficulties into assets.\n\n\nI'm heading into this campaign with my eyes open. If this campaign meets with success we'll be on the hook to you guys for loads more quality content. The bigger we get, the more complex fulfillment will become.

To eliminate messy wires, we've daisy-chained each leg to one another instead of having each leg connected to the control panel with a cable.\n  The end result is a sleek, smart, simple & affordable smart desk that allows you to adjust from sitting to standing with ease.\nUsing Bluetooth technology, StandiT senses when you're near and moves to your predetermined height.\n  Create a desk that suits your style.\nNot every office is uniformly sized, so we allow you to choose the dimensions of your desk.

We want to ensure quality in each and every one of our products so we perform testing on every unit before shipping. Although more costly, we believe in ensuring the absolute best for our customers.\n\n3. Each StandiT component is made of dozens of parts which come from different suppliers. As with any other hardware products, suppliers may deliver later or not at all, leaving us in a bad situation. To remedy that, we have sourced each component from at least two suppliers, so that if one can't do the job, we can easily switch to the other and reduce delays.\n\n4. Because of the size and weight of a piece of furniture, shipping can be expensive. Thanks to our easy modular design and assembly process, we have reduced packaging to its minimum, making it easier than ever to ship and receive.

Remember, all of these stretch goals will benefit our backers - the money we raise now will go right back to you!\nWho Is The Magnificent?\nThe first graphic novel by Chimera\u2019s Comics, \"Magnificent\" is an original 66-page paperback by Carmelo Chimera, Steven Brown, and David Gonzalez. \"Magnificent\" is a story about the pains of growing up and staying true to yourself no matter what life throws you.\nThe Story\nHave you ever had your heart broken? Do you remember the first time you felt pride in a talent? When was the last time you fell flat on your face or screwed up so badly you thought the world would end?\nEven though Adam is a super-hero, all of this happened to him too. He was called The Magnificent, but that was before. Before he was captured, tortured, and experimented on. Over his life he learned the same lessons we all do \u2013 how to love, how to fail, and how to persevere.\nAnd when Adam discovers he\u2019s more powerful than he ever imagined, everything he\u2019s learned comes together to answer life\u2019s greatest question: are we shaped by the cynicism of a cruel world, or can we choose who we want to be no matter what?\nThe Characters\nAdam Garfield is The Magnificent. His naivety will make him vulnerable to attack from all sides. Whether its a neglected girlfriend, a jealous military leader, or a psychopath looking for a fight, the world seems resolved to make his naive mission a trial by fire. Adam will go through pain and failure beyond description before discovering his true power. And when he does, Adam will have to prove if he\u2019s a true hero\u2026by being true to himself.\nPencilled Artwork In Progress\nMaxwell Edison has a problem: What do you get for the man who has everything?  With the ability to control electromagnetism, there is no challenge left in the world for Maxwell. That is, until he sees The Magnificent picking up buildings on TV. Maxwell was on the first plane out from the UK to meet the young hero and, hopefully, find the fight of his life. Maxwell\u2019s masochistic and hedonistic mentality is the perfect foil for the Magnificent\u2019s selflessness. Unlike the young hero, Maxwell believes power is meant to be used. \nPencilled and Inked Artwork In Progress.\nThe General is the mysterious leader of Blackstone, a paramilitary group that has imprisoned The Magnificent. The General sees The Magnificent as his own son, and believes he must teach this child that life is pain. But as the years roll on, the young hero\u2019s refusal to compromise challenges everything the cynical General believes about the world.\nInked Artwork in progress.\nThe Dream \n6 years ago, Carmelo Chimera wrote an original graphic novel. Partnering with his long-time friend Steven Brown, the duo worked closer than ever to create \u201cMagnificent.\u201d\nWhile working on the comic book, Steven and Carmelo got sidetracked by opening Chimera\u2019s Comics. Their first store opened in La Grange, Illinois in 2011 and they\u2019ve since opened two more stores and are starting an online store as we speak.\nChimera's Comics Third Location in Woodridge\nRunning Chimera\u2019s Comics taught Steven and Carmelo more about making and selling comics than they ever thought possible, and introduced them to their newest collaborator David \u201cHommy\u201d Gonzalez. Hommy is a graphic designed and marketing consultant for Chimera\u2019s Comics by night, and the Interim Executive Director of The Port Ministries by day.\nChimera\u2019s Comics was designed to me be more than just a store. With weekly gaming tournaments, special events like 24 Hour Comics Day, professional guests and more, Chimera\u2019s Comics has become a community. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so fitting that we\u2019re asking our community to come together to help make our dream for \u201cMagnificent\u201d a reality. This is how we come full circle. You\u2019ve brought us this far, and we try to thank you by giving you the best comic book store we can. Now we want to thank you by giving you the best comic we can.\nThe Creators\nMeet the creative team! Art by Claire Faulkner.\nCarmelo Chimera was born on Krypton, but when he came to Earth he grew up in the suburbs of Chicago. He wrote \u201cMagnificent\u201d while studying at Carthage College, and even after law school at the University of Chicago Carmelo was still a big enough nerd to open Chimera\u2019s Comics with Steven Brown. Three stores later, the duo has returned to finish what they started and reveal \u201cMagnificent\u201d to the world.\nSteven Brown, like most artists, get his inspiration from his misunderstood and tortured soul. While attending the American Academy of Art in Chicago, Steven cultivated such past times as brooding, acting incredulous, and showing disdain for basic human emotion. He\u2019s put his talents to use as a professional storyboard artist and is the co-founder and true mastermind of Chimera\u2019s Comics. He is also the co-host of the store\u2019s podcast, Caffeinated Comics. In spite of everything, he is universally well-liked and widely regarded as \u201cfun to be around.\u201d\nDavid Gonzalez has yet to be reached for comment. When we called him to complete this interview, we were routed through a complex system of teleprompts before we gave up and drove to his office at The Port Ministries. Though we can\u2019t be sure, we think we saw him running out the back and down the block while we were knocking on the front door of his office. He continues to upload inked and colored artwork into our Dropbox though, so that\u2019s something.\nThe Budget\nSee how we'll use your support to bring \"Magnificent\" to life\nA breakdown of the expenses involved.\nThe Timeline\nAn outline of our projected deadlines to complete the project\nThe Production\nFor the production, we've turned to one of the most trusted names in comic printing, PrintNinja. Local to Evanston, Illinois, PrintNinja has both the quality of workmanship and the brand reputation to bring our project to life.\nThe Setting\n\"Magnificent\" is a Chicago-centric story. The titular hero is named for the famous Magnificent Mile, and his enemies are also named for famous Chicago streets. The story itself takes place in Chicago - from the playgrounds of the suburbs to the rooftops of the Loop's skyscrapers.  It's fitting that a story about growing up take place in the city where the creators grew up.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe hardest part about completing \"Magnificent\" is the same issue we've had for 6 years. Life happens, and we have deferred this dream over and over again. Not without good reason - we've opened three comic book stores, Carmelo became a lawyer, and David spends 12 hours a day turning The Port Ministries into the best charity it can be. Delays involved in the creative process and printing/shipping logistics are also possible.\n\nHowever, over the last four years Chimera's Comics has not only survived, but thrived. Everything we have put our minds to has come true. With our business experience, we know how to create a plan and stick to it. We are ready to make this project our number one priority, as we once did with our stores. We're working to minimize risks by working with reputable printers, and using our established industry and distributor contacts.\n\nAs with everything we have done, there are no challenges we cannot overcome when a community like this one unites behind us.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #51", "update_userinfo": "A Free Bonus For You", "update_content": "This will be my final update on the Magnificent Kickstarter.

Killing is bad, arresting villains is good, the law must be upheld, the people must be protected.  But what happens when superheroes are forced to live in shades of gray?\nDAS Group is an action comic book (with a bit of a darker sense of humor) that explores a world conquered by the savage super humans known as Defects.  In this world only one place remains a safe haven for mankind, Victory City.  But in this case, safe is a relative term.  The city is ruled by Victor, who aside from being a big enough narcissist to name an entire city after himself, was the self appointed overlord of the criminal underworld prior to the defects assault on mankind. Viewing Victors reign as a necessary evil, a small group of defects living in Victory city accepted his \"request\" that they aid him in maintaining control.  And so, DAS Group was formed. \nBut after years of serving what Victor calls \"the greater good\", and with a defect invasion on their doorstep, choices must be made.  Can DAS Group break the city free of Victors grasp without plunging it into chaos?  Or should his reign be allowed to continue for the sake of the greater good?  And above all else, how far can our team of superheroes go before they become the villains? Every decision has steep consequences, and sacrifices must be made. There cant always be a happy ending.\nPage 11.\n\nTHE PROJECT...\nThe project is pretty simple, DAS Group is going to be a 24 page full color comic book. As you read this I am slaving away in my dungeon to pencil, ink, and color every single page of this masterpiece.  However, without a little help we will never be able to afford the publishing costs. To fund our first round of printing, we will need to raise at least $1000. This will allow us to print 500 copies of DAS Group issue #1, and assist with the cost of shipping each and every one of you your awesome rewards! Even at $1000 we are still going to be covering part of the printing costs ourselves so its important this kickstarter is a success.\nHOW ABOUT A PEEK?\nNow that we are done discussing business, take a moment and enjoy some artwork from DAS Group.\nAND DONT FORGET...\nFor just $50 you earn one of the original ONE OF A KIND ink pages used to create DAS Group! These pages will never be available again, so get them while you can.\nNOW, LETS DISCUSS THE FUTURE...\nAfter reading the summary of our story you're probably thinking it is way too big to do justice in just 24 pages. Well, we couldn't agree more. Our goal is to tell the story over a minimum of 6 issues. That means over the life of this endeavor, we are facing over $7000 in printing fees alone, not to mention supplies, shipping costs, and advertising. So we are going to give you guys a little incentive to help us get as close to our stretch goals as possible.\nIF WE RAISE $2,000...\nThe comic book will be printed with 4 additional pages of concept art. \nAll print copies shipped to backers will be signed by the entire DAS Group creative team.\nEvery backer that pledges $5 or more will get a free PDF copy of issue #2 when it becomes available. \nAll backers pledging $10 or more will receive a 5 x 7 signed character sketch along with their printed copy of the comic book.\nAnd Backers pledging $20 or more will receive an additional signed 11 x 17 print featuring artwork by the entire DAS Group creative team. And lets just say with some of their \"limited\" artistic skills, Its bound to be a classic.\nGET MORE REWARDS FOR YOUR PLEDGE...\nYou guys want more rewards? Well we want to give you more.

We've got new options at $45, $50, $70, $100, and $135. You can get entire bundles of music at each of those tiers, but the $70 tier is an extremely limited (10 ONLY) offering where Jim will personally sign and send you a vinyl of Sword & Sworcery LP - The Ballad of the Space Babies. If you haven't heard the S&S music or seen the artwork before, they're both incredbly impressive!\nWHAT IS OUTERLANDS?\nA DOCUMENTARY \"TV SERIES\" ... Even though this isn't for a TV network, we're calling it a \"TV series\" because of the format. It'll be a minimum of six one-hour episodes. A TV \"one hour\" can mean anything from 42 to 60 minutes.\nIN SIX EPISODES ... We could potentially do more than six if we reach some of our stretch goals!\nABOUT THE PEOPLE AND CULTURE OF VIDEOGAMES ... Videogames are art. Art is culture. Within any culture are beautiful traditions, heartfelt passions, and incredible, unbelievable stories to be told. That's where Outerlands comes in.\nTHAT CAN'T BE MADE ANY OTHER WAY. Traditional media outlets, broadcast networks, and even the new wave of original content from online distribution aren't going to take a \"risk\" on videogame content. We don't think it is a risk. We think videogames are a global cultural revolution that's sweeping in whole new ways of looking at the world, inspiring countless people into new lives, and that untold numbers are aching for this kind of content. Help us prove it!\nWHY $210,000?\nVideo is expensive\u2014especially documentary content that requires ongoing access over a long period and a lot of travel. AREA 5 has become very good at knowing how much a production is going to cost. Originally, we were thinking about showing a bunch of awful spreadsheets and writing walls of text to explain where the money is going. Fortunately, Braid artist David Hellman came to our rescue!\nWHO'S MAKING IT?\nAREA 5 is Ryan O'Donnell, Matt Chandronait, Jason Bertrand, Cesar Quintero, and Rick Curnutte. You can find out more about us on the AREA 5 web site. We're also collaborating with some INCREDIBLE people that are just as excited as we are to make this happen! And, if we hit our FREELANCERS STRETCH GOAL, there will be even more people added to the team!\nIS IT ONLY ABOUT PRESERVING OLD GAMES? (ANSWER: NO!)\nGame preservation is only one important topic\u2014one which is particularly easy to tackle in the San Francisco Bay Area (where AREA 5 is located), which is why it's the featured example in our Kickstarter video. Our ambition is to explore every story that we can possibly afford to! To give you a better idea of what we're going for, this series is directly inspired by This American Life, Radiolab, Objectified and Helvetica, A Life Well Wasted, 99% Invisible, Polygon's Human Angle, State of Play, and, of course Indie Game: The Movie.\nWHAT OTHER TOPICS WILL THE SERIES COVER?\nIt goes by pretty fast in the Kickstarter video, but there's a scene with a cloud of words in there. Those topics are just a taste of what's on our list. We can't even imagine the kinds of stories other minds can bring into the fold if we can get to our FREELANCERS STRETCH GOAL!  We will also be holding polls and surveys throughout the Kickstarter period to hear about topics YOU want to cover! \nA small sampling of topics we think will result in incredible stories\nWILL YOU DELIVER THE EPISODES AS YOU FINISH THEM?\nNo. We know from experience that we'll get the absolute highest quality by shooting and editing everything together. Whether you're backing at a level that gets you the series digitally or on Blu-ray, you'll get the entire season as a package. Filming a documentary is about being there and we want to have the opportunity to film that last great story for episode 1 even if we're just finishing shooting for episode 6. Besides, who doesn't like to binge-watch TV these days?\nWHEN WILL IT BE DONE?\nWe are predicting 18 months from the finish of the Kickstarter campaign. That is roughly mid-July of 2015. The first six months will be pre-production (research, scheduling, travel arrangements, legal, insurance) and production (the actual shooting). Post-production (the period where we do all the editing, add in graphics, mix the sound, produce and edit a soundtrack, and so forth) will happen afterward. Kickstarter rewards will be designed and updates posted throughout the 18-month cycle.\nREWARDS\nWe are honored to be working with Humble Bundle and Fangamer for our backer rewards! They helped Double Fine Productions and Mighty No.9 on their Kickstarters, so you know we're working with the right folks to make sure you get your rewards on time and at the highest quality!\nBACKERS-ONLY LIVESTREAM - We will hold live streams at a secret URL that only Kickstarter backers will get access to. In it we'll show you stuff we've shot, rough edits of stories we're working on, and get your feedback on where to go next! We'll also trot out deleted scenes from past AREA 5 content.

To Jim Guthrie and Disasterpeace for the music, and for our first documentary subjects!\nIf you're ever even somewhat close to Alameda, California, do yourself a favor and head out to High Scores Arcade Interactive Museum. All games are on free play and it's only $5 for an hour or $10 for a whole freakin' day! The owners, Meg and Shawn, are the coolest people ever! Also in the video are Mike Mika and Frank Cifaldi from Other Ocean Interactive. Besides being great game developers, Mike and Frank have made enormous efforts to preserve games and gaming culture. That shot of Frank looking at old slides is in Mike's famous basement that many of us first learned about on Robert Ashley's incredible podcast A Life Well Wasted. Our filming with Frank, Meg, Shawn, and Mike is far from complete, but we're already well into our production thanks to their tremendous help! We've also shot at the Oakland M.A.D.E. museum\u2014though it isn't featured explicitly in the Kickstarter video.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOur production schedule is set for roughly 18 months. That's a long time and a lot can happen in that period, but AREA 5 has been in business for 5 years and in that time we've finished dozens of productions. From full-length documentaries, to trailers, mini-docs, and fictional shorts. We know exactly what it'll take to protect ourselves and our content while making this series.\n\nThe main risks for any film project are accidents\u2014both to equipment and personnel. Of course we mitigate this as much as possible by taking out insurance as appropriate to every production, but that doesn't mean that catastrophic events can't occur that could cause us to lose some or all of our footage on a given trip to a foreign land. If this happens and our budget doesn't allow us a reshoot, we'll find other amazing stories to tell that will allow us to fulfill our promise to deliver the series on time.\n\nOther than losing content on location, we have a triple, multi-location backup plan for all our content. Short of San Francisco falling into the ocean, we should be covered.\n\nFinally\u2014and this one's a doozy\u2014we've heard tales of certain Kickstarters that have been funded and then had their largest backers deny/reverse the charges after the campaign is over. As you can imagine, this can be hugely devastating to a lean-and-mean documentary project. There's only so much contingency a budget can absorb before something has to slip.

You'll receive the same rewards as Kickstarter backers, including Stretch Goals.\nNote that we added 1 free booster draft a week for 1 year per account to the Dungeon Crawler, Raid Leader, Guild Master, and Collector tiers!\nThe first ever real MMO/TCG for your PC & MAC\nFrom the team that brings you the World of Warcraft Trading Card Game, HEX is a free-to-play game that combines the compelling collectible and strategic game play of a trading card game (TCG) with the amazing community and storytelling aspects of a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game (MMORPG) to create an entirely new gaming experience: the MMO/TCG. We've come so far in pairing these two genres together, and we're asking for your help to take us across the finish line\nCryptozoic Entertainment, creators and publishers of the World of Warcraft Trading Card Game, is excited and proud to introduce HEX: Shards of Fate, the first real MMO/TCG. A completely unique game that takes place in an original and exciting fantasy world, HEX was created from the ground up as a digital trading card game and brings tremendous innovation to how a TCG can be played.\nWith all the social interaction and roleplaying you would expect from a fully featured MMORPG, along with the deep strategic and collectible game play of a TCG, HEX is a completely new gaming experience. We're designing full card sets, dungeons, storyline, community tools, advanced AI, and so much more. This is a massive undertaking and that's why we're asking for your help to bring HEX to life.\nWhat are our goals for HEX?\n\u2022 We want to bring together both experienced TCG veterans and new players who have never played a collectible card game before. The game is free to download and play, so anyone can give it a try!\n\u2022 We want you to join guilds with other TCG players and practice dueling with the latest deck builds. \n\u2022 We want you to enter online TCG tournaments and win awesome prizes. \n\u2022 We want you to take your TCG skills and have them drive an RPG experience, unlocking new cards and treasure, as well as developing your character within a compelling, completely original story.\n\u2022 Most of all, we want the experience to be deep, engaging, and polished.\nThat\u2019s what we want to provide for you \u2026 but we need your help!\nHEX takes everything you would expect from a full, deep trading card game and combines it with a massively multiplayer online role-playing game\nLet\u2019s start by discussing the elements of the TCG.\nThe great news is that HEX was designed from the ground up to take advantage of the \u201cdigital\u201d part of \u201cdigital TCG\u201d. This means we have innovated a number of fun and unique ways of doing things that have never been done before in a TCG, which are detailed below. \nHere at Cryptozoic, our bread and butter is creating polished TCGs; it\u2019s how we make our living. When it comes to producing a balanced and deep TCG experience, the design is king. The fun digital features will always support and enhance the play experience, and never trump it. Features like clean resource tracking, transforming cards, and allowing you to easily broadcast your games to viewers across the internet are all possible due to innovation in the digital space. \nFor experienced TCG players, we have designed the card set around Booster Draft and Limited play. We have engineered the card sets to launch three times a year, like a standard TCG. We have put a tremendous amount of work into creating the best possible online TCG experience, both in terms of balance and design, as well as a graphical polish. \nNot only that, but surrounding this TCG is an amazing online role-playing experience\nAs can be expected from the company that makes the World of Warcraft TCG, we are a company filled to the brim with hardcore MMORPG players, and some of our designers have even built MMORPGs in the past. For example, Kevin Jordan, who was one of the three original designers of the universe\u2019s most successful MMORPG, World of Warcraft, is now the lead for the HEX MMORPG elements.\n As hardcore MMORPG players, we had a huge list of features that we thought could really make an online TCG incredible! Not the least of which is a robust, story-based PVE experience, complete with dungeons and raids and monsters and loot, all tied around playing a card game. When we started thinking about PVE, community, guilds, auction houses, factions, storytelling (all the stuff that makes an MMORPG fun), we knew that HEX could be something special, something that had never been done before! \nIt is difficult to get all the innovation built into HEX into one easy-to-digest place, but let\u2019s give it a try with this handy\u2026 \nFEATURES LIST!\nMMORPG:\n- Create your CHAMPION character with a choice of 6 classes and 8 races\nFully customizable champions with talents, gear, and game altering abilities that revolutionize the TCG experience.\nPre alpha game play\n- Collect GEAR in rarities from common to legendary and tailor your champion\u2019s winning strategy\nEach card in the game is linked to several pieces of gear that fundamentally change how the card works. Equip this gear and find MILLIONS of unique combos and winning strategies. \nAnd keep your eyes open for extra rare SET BONUSES\n- Explore dozens of DUNGEONS and battle with friends in epic RAIDS\nDungeons offer the ultimate PVE experience: deep TCG puzzles and encounters unfold the world of HEX and offer over a hundred hours of game play, storytelling, and the chance to earn new cards and gear (including over 300 unique PVE cards).\nKraken's Gold Dungeon\nHEX FEATURES THE MOST ADVANCED TCG AI EVER CREATED\n- Utilize HEX\u2019s advanced GUILD functionality, and join or create the ultimate TCG group\nPractice with friends using the guild deck bank, or join guild sanctioned tournaments.\nShare cards with your guild via the guild bank\n- Buy and sell cards, gear, and other in-game rewards in a robust and fully featured AUCTION HOUSE\nA full player economy will allow you to trade and sell your gear and cards as you build the ultimate collection.\n- Earn FACTION REWARDS as you complete quests and unlock world-shattering adventures in the world of HEX\nFaction rewards offer players unique cards and gear; as your faction allegiance grows, so does the power of your rewards.\nTCG:\n- Fully featured TCG with over 350 cards in the first set alone\nCryptozoic is a leading TCG publisher with years of experience building the World of Warcraft TCG; we have brought that expertise to HEX with the same attention to detail so we can offer the finest digital TCG experience available.\nPre alpha gameplay and interface\nAmazing Digital TCG Innovations!\n- SOCKETED CARDS! Put gems into cards to customize how they play\u2026 with the first ever sandbox TCG, you can design the card\nWith 20 gems in the first set and numerous socketed cards, the combinations are endless as you mix and match to create your own perfect combo.\n- The DOUBLE BACK feature makes each card a unique collectable and gives each a life of its own\nFlip your card and see its back, flip it again and see the DOUBLE BACK; each double back features 3 card achievements (unlock them all to transform the card into an \u201cextended art\u201d version), a leveling bar (fill it to transform the card into a foil variant), a trophy case (earn trophies using the card in a tournament-winning deck), and other card-specific information.\n- TRANSFORMING CARDS change mid-match as you play, level your troop or hatch a mighty dragon from an egg during the fight\nTransforming cards offer players the chance to engage in new strategic formats in an effort to grow their cards mid-match and unlock fun powers and game winning abilities.\n- The most aggressive ORGANIZED PLAY infrastructure ever offered for a digital TCG\nWith dozens of daily tournaments, on demand 8-player drafts and (potentially) REAL CASH prizes, HEX is poised to be the definitive professional online TCG.\nCome tournament time, test your mettle in limited (sealed and booster) and constructed tournaments, where the winner is determined by skill and daring, not by PVE-enhanced cards.\nFounded in 2010, Cryptozoic Entertainment, Inc. is a premier developer and publisher of original and licensed board games, card games, comics and trading cards, including the World of Warcraft\u00ae Trading Card Game, DC Deck Building Game, Epic Spell Wars of the Battle Wizards and The Walking Dead\u2122 Board Game. Following a philosophy and core principle of \"Fans First,\" the dedicated gamers and fans of the Cryptozoic Entertainment team are focused on producing fun and amazing products along with epic events that bring all gaming fans together as part of the Cryptozoic community. World of Warcraft TCG has been translated into 9 languages, and with millions of packs in print, it is one of the most popular TCGs in the world!\nCryptozoic makes games based on some of the most popular brands!\n\nThe scope and magnitude of HEX is bonkers! Not only are we trying to create a completely new gaming category (the MMO/TCG), but we are doing it at a scale that is just plain crazy \u2026 for example, this will be the largest first set of cards ever created for a TCG launch.\nBut we feel this is the type of game that needs to have everything in the first pass to make it work as a whole. The magic of HEX is that it has so many different things working together to create something remarkably fun and different.\nWe have been in development for almost two years and have accomplished a lot. As you can see from our videos and screenshots, the game is looking incredible. But we need your help to finish. With this last push we can fund HEX\u2019s remaining development and give this game the launch it deserves.\nAll of our reward tiers offer huge values. We are offering standard products at a fraction of the price you would buy them at launch, as well as very cool exclusive cards that will only be available through this Kickstarter (once this campaign ends, these Kickstarter-exclusive cards will never again appear in any future set release). We wanted to make sure that you are not just making a donation to finish the game, we want you to feel like you have made an investment in the online TCG you are going to playing for a very long time.\nOur goal is 300,000. This amount will insure we can meet the last of our art and engineering requirements. We have a robust number of stretch goals, and hope we can reveal some of them (hopefully, all of them!). With the support of you\u2014the gaming community\u2014we will be able to launch HEX together with all the features that will make this a landmark title.\n330K - Authenticator Support At Launch.

It can be difficult to predict the stumbling blocks even in the best case scenario, so with something as new and innovative as HEX, it can be even more difficult. \n\nThe good news is that HEX has been in development for almost two years and we have built a series of deliverables that we believe can be completed in the remaining development time we have scheduled. We have tested the game systems and feel confident everything will socket together and create a fantastic experience.

In the strategy layer, you oversee your kingdom, arrange royal marriages, conduct research, and make the far-reaching decisions that will determine the fate of your legacy.\nIn the tactics layer, you fight brutal turn-based battles to defend your kingdom using small squads of customizable heroes.\nForest environment (early concept) - click for Hi-Res version\nPermadeath is inevitable: your heroes will grow, age, and eventually die.

Every day millions of people are subjected to the torture of milk crusties. We are here to help. We have reinvented the milk cap.\nNews Coverage\nWhere did this idea come from?\nFor years, every time I poured milk into my cereal, coffee, or tea I would get pieces of dried milk falling into my bowl or cup. This has bothered me to no end and then I noticed others online dealing with the same problem. I figured there must be some way to pour milk without getting these dreaded milk crusties ruining my food and drinks. Over the past few months I have worked to redesign and reinvent the milk cap and with the help of Professor Randy Emert and his class; we have reengineered the milk cap from the ground up.\nWe now have a patent-pending design that allows the milk to flow freely from practically any gallon or carton without forming any dry spots or milk crusties. You can still buy the same brand of milk from your local grocery store or pharmacy and use the MilkCapper to keep your food and drinks safe.\nWhat are the advantages to using the MilkCapper?\nNo more dried milk crusties!\nDishwasher safe, FDA food grade plastic (high quality and durable)\nYour milk will pour and flow easier and smoother with the engineered spout\nMultiple colors (green, blue, and red) for different types of milk (1%, 2%, Whole milk)\nFits virtually all milk, tea, and water gallons from all major brands\nEasy to screw on while being child safe from the the snap on cover\nWorks with the original milk cap bottom piece still attached\nThe pop-on top will keep your milk fresh and safe\nHand made in Georgia with plastic injection molding, made one at a time\nHow Does It Work\nThe MilkCapper is quite ingenious in the way the spout pours out milk. It is designed with an inner lip at the perfect angle so no milk will ever accumulate and dry again to form dried milk crusties. Inside the cap is a sloped piece that allows it to snugly fit over all types of milk gallon containers. The threads have been perfectly engineered to work with virtually any milk jug as well. Finally, the top cover has a rounded snap piece that allows you to pop on and off the top without ever disrupting the threaded pourer. This makes the overall cap much safer and stronger while keeping the milk fresh. The examples shown here are from a 3D printer, the professional plastic injection molded MilkCapper will be smoother, stronger, more polished, and have an even nicer aesthetic appeal.\nWhere can I find more about it?\nCheck us out on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/MilkCapper\nOr check out a recent news story about the MilkCapper on USAToday: http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2013/01/23/invention-prevents-crusties-milk-jugs/1858503/\nWhat is the production plan?\nIf we are fortunate enough to have our campaign goal met then we will immediately order the FDA food safe plastics from our distributor in North Carolina. At that point we already have the SolidWorks files which will create the aluminum and/or steel injection molds. All we will need to do is inject, press, and scrub the MilkCappers one by one. Each one is essentially hand made in that regard. The whole process will take less than a week to have the plastics paid for and delivered, machine the metal mold, and press and inject the MilkCappers. Depending on the quantity we need to make, it could take a few days to a week to manufacture all the MilkCappers in the three colors available. Each one takes roughly two minutes to press and another few minutes to clean and inspect.\nAfter we fulfill all of the pledges make on Kickstarter we will be able to mass produce MilkCappers for store shelves everywhere!\nWhat are the different colors about?\nThe three colors of the MilkCapper are for the universal 1%, 2%, and Whole milk types in the United States, each color indicates which type of milk it is. But you can still use any color with any type you would like.\nMilkCapper - 1% Milk Cap - Kickstarter Green\nMilkCapper - 2% Milk Cap - Blue\nMilkCapper - Whole Milk Cap - Red", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhile there were few real risks, there have been many challenges from the beginning. It took many months of planning, designing, prototyping, and manufacturing just to find the right kind of shape and design for the MilkCapper to get rid of milk crusties. We then had to find a way for the threads of our milk cap to work with all milk jugs, half gallons and gallons. After going through dozens of prototypes we have perfected our design and have the MilkCapper ready.\n\nIf and when the MilkCapper is funded we will have to wait 14 days for Amazon Payments to be processed. We will then be able to produce the MilkCappers with the high-end plastic injection mold equipment we have available. We have all of the necessary contacts with various plastic producers and have the colors selected already. There should be no delays whatsoever in getting the MilkCapper out to all of you in either late December or early January.\n\nWe need your support and pledges to help us get the high grade FDA food safe plastic, steel/aluminum injection mold built and machined for our plastic to be injected into, and a shipping container to highlight the beautiful and aesthetic design of the MilkCapper. We have calculated that it will be $5,000 to get all the required parts and pieces together to have the MilkCapper get off the ground. We need your help to do this and in exchange we are offering you the ability to never have dried milk crusties ruin your cereal, coffee, or tea again.

We hit our goal and every single stretch goal we set, and it's all thanks to you.  We are so humbled, grateful, and excited at what an amazing experience this entire kickstarter has been for us.  Thank you.\nGreetings Earth Humans!  \nWe are I Fight Dragons, and in case you don't know what we look like I've inserted a picture of us standing in front of several planets we've saved:\nBill is the robot on the far left, Chad is the alien on the far right, Packy is the arbormorph next to him, Hari is the grue second from the left, and I'm the human in the middle.  My name is Brian.\nIf you're reading this, chances are you already know a thing or two about our band, but just in case you don't, I'm going to regale you with the quick version of our story so far.\nBefore I get started though, I should probably give you some idea of what our music sounds like.  Well, you might say it sounds like a group of five guys battling hipster zombies with weaponized Nintendo peripherals in a cabin in the woods.  In case that's not a clear enough picture, here's a music video we made in which the five of us battle hipster zombies with weaponized Nintendo peripherals in a cabin in the woods:\nNow at this point you're probably wondering how we ended up in that cabin.  Actually I'm wondering that myself.  I should probably start at the beginning.\nI Fight Dragons started in 2008, with a flux-capacitor-style falling-off-the-toilet-and-hitting-your-head eureka moment.  Bill and I were working together for the first time, making a demo, when I had the idea to make part of the song we were working on sound like it was coming out of an old Nintendo.  After some \"research\" (playing Mario 3 for a while), we dove in, and the result was the first I Fight Dragons song - \"Heads Up, Hearts Down.\"  \nYou might say it was 'that new sound I had been looking for,' and it was the beginning of a sonic journey that has taken us through 4 years and over 50,000 miles, through 2 EPs and 1 album, signing to a major label, leaving a major label, 4 national tours, hundreds of shows, and more adventure than we could have possibly imagined sitting there in Bill's basement in 2008.\nBut imagine we did.  Bill and I co-produced our first 5-song EP, \"Cool Is Just A Number,\" which we self-released in early 2009 and played a ton of shows around Chicago.  To our unending shock, more and more people came out to see us play at every show, to the point that we were invited on our first national tour opening for mc chris, and by the end of 2009 we had a manager, a booking agent, and an offer on the table from Atlantic Records.\nAfter thinking long and hard about it, we decided to take a leap and sign the deal. We spent 2 years on Atlantic from 2010-2012, learning the ins and outs of the music industry from within the belly of the beast, getting to tour with some amazing bands and work with some incredibly talented people, and throughout it all we waged an epic artistic battle to create a major label album that we could call our own.\nI'm happy to say we won that battle, in the form of our debut album KABOOM!.  We got to make exactly the record we wanted, but in the end Atlantic just didn't think it was commercially viable, even after our song \"The Geeks Will Inherit The Earth\" went to #1 on KTCL, Denver's alternative rock radio station.\nThus, we decided to make a break for it, and even though it took us a year, we finally won our release from Atlantic at the end of 2012.  Lots of bands end their label deals on a bitter note, but for us 2013 so far has been all about taking the lessons we've learned from the past 4 years and forging a weapon of sonic magnitude so powerful that ancient monks will fall to their knees and weep at the sound of it sweeping through the sky.\nWhich brings us to today.\nToday we are launching our very first Kickstarter campaign, and we've dubbed it Project Atma:\nProject Atma is the culmination of our journey so far.  We want to create an artifact for the ages, a glowing slab of vinyl wrapped in a gorgeous piece of artwork, steeped in the mists of the future.\nSo just what the hell does that mean? You know, I'm glad you asked.\nFirst of all, we're abandoning the now-obsolete CD format.  What's the use of a CD in 2013 anyway, besides possibly as an undersized frisbee or very ineffective ninja throwing weapon?\nInstead, we're planning to create this album on a deluxe 180-gram Vinyl LP, packaged in a huge double gatefold sleeve with wraparound cover art.  The vinyl will of course come with a high-quality digital download for portability, thus providing the proverbial \"best of both worlds\".\nWe've already written many of the songs for the new album, and it just so happens that one entire side of the record will be a 20-minute-long story-based song suite involving superpowers, a love story, a parallel dimension, and some epic battles.  To this end, there will also be a companion oversized graphic novel / lyric booklet in the second pocket of the LP packaging, depicting scenes from the story, designed to be read while you listen to the music.\nThe digital download itself will also be extensive: In addition to the album itself every record will come with a collection of demos and b-sides from the album sessions, as well as instrumental/karaokes, a cappellas, and remix stems for every song.\nPlus, if we're able to surpass our goal, the physical LP will transform and expand, adding pieces and morphing into the aural weapon of destiny we know it can be: \nAnd we should mention that all of these upgrades apply to EVERYONE who donates at the $20 level or above, no additional donation required.\nEDIT 5-20-13: Plus if we reach the documentary mega-stretch goal, everyone who donates $15 or more will receive a digital copy of the documentary when it's finished, they'll get their name in the credits, and they'll even have the option to BE IN THE MOVIE in a large user-submitted video scene.\nSo what else do we have planned for Project Atma?\nEvery week throughout the campaign, we'll be releasing exclusive IFD music that can only be downloaded here on Kickstarter as part of Project Atma.  Everyone who donates anything will receive all of these files.\nWEEK 1- New IFD Song \"Burnadette\" (demo)\n(http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1899688657/project-atma-i-fight-dragons-creates-an-epic-new-a/posts/467600)\nWEEK 2- IFD Live at Metro Chicago 12-14-12 (full video / audio)\n(http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1899688657/project-atma-i-fight-dragons-creates-an-epic-new-a/posts/473929)\nWEEK 3- New IFD acoustic kickstarter-exclusive version of cRaZie$\n(http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1899688657/project-atma-i-fight-dragons-creates-an-epic-new-a/posts/479444)\nWEEK 4 - \"The Geeks Will Inherit The Earth - Gameboy Mix\" \n(http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1899688657/project-atma-i-fight-dragons-creates-an-epic-new-a/posts/488154)\nWEEK 5 - \"I Fight Dragons & Friends\"\n(http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1899688657/project-atma-i-fight-dragons-creates-an-epic-new-a/posts/493847)\nThen on June 1st, the last day of the kickstarter, we'll have a special backers-only internet-streamed acoustic IFD event at Uncommon Ground in Chicago.  We'll be previewing songs from the album as well as playing old favorites.  A limited number of tickets to join us in person are available in the rewards, but anyone who has supported the kickstarter at any level will have access to the live internet stream, and we'll post the recorded video for any backers that can't catch the live stream.\nUPDATE: The stream will start at 10PM US Central Time on Saturday June 1st and the link will be sent out as a Kickstarter Update!\nWhich brings us to many people's favorite section of any kickstarter:\nWe've already covered most of the basic rewards, from the digital rewards to the Physical LP, and for not too much more you can even get your name in the album credits, your voice on the album, get every song IFD has ever released, and even more crazy limited items beyond that.\nThe details of the rewards are listed on the right, but sometimes a picture is worth several hundred words, so here's some photo-documentation of some of the exclusive swag on offer:\nNOTE 5-20-13: This picture is a little out of date and doesn't include the Project Atma 2.0 reward tiers - we'll get it fixed soon but in the meanwhile look in the rewards column to the right for the latest accurate updates on availability!\nSo that's Project Atma.  It's I Fight Dragons taking a flying leap off a high cliff, with the vague hope that we'll learn to fly on the way down, or at the very least that we'll invent jet packs.\nMore than anything else we're thrilled to be back in control of our own destiny, to be able to make the crazy art we want to make, and to be able to share it with you.\nSo how far will we take this ridiculous endeavor?\nWell, ultimately that's up to you.  For my part, I hope you'll see fit to join us on this next leg of our adventure.  If nothing else, it's gonna be one hell of a ride :)\nUntil soon - your friendly neighborhood dragon fighters,\nBrian, Chad, Hari, Bill, and Packy\nI Fight Dragons\nAdd-On Records:\nAfter overwhelming demand, we've officially begun to accept add-ons.

We're a pair of filmmakers from Chicago who've been working under the banner of DimeStore Films for nearly a decade. We've written/produced/shot/edited over a dozen short films and commercials. Christian's got a formal education in Film and Video from Columbia College Chicago, as well as hands on experience associate producing and shooting content for The History Channel, Biography Channel, and Comcast OnDemand. Hunter has a degree in rhetoric from a Big 10 university and his recent letter writing campaign to Dr. Pepper has been rewarded with a free pencil. Some examples of our work can be viewed at our website. We also have some choice selections from our narrative and commercial work peppered throughout below.\nAbout the Project\nThe Origins of Wit and Humor is our first feature length film, looking to begin shooting fall 2013. It's about a comedy writer, Les Candalero, struggling to find his identity when so much of his time is spent trying to please an audience, which to him, is everyone. If he\u2019s not trying to make someone laugh what does he have to say? Beyond that, there are failed relationships, homages to the history of comedy, elements of magical realism, an array of eccentric characters to keep things interesting for our protagonist, and flourishes of visual eccentricity to keep things interesting for our audience. \nOh you want the official breakdown? Ok, we have that for you, too:\nLogline: A comedy writer\u2019s desperate need for approval leads him into increasingly bizarre scenarios as he tries to explore his own worth outside of the writer\u2019s room. \nSynopsis: After the abrupt end of a five-year relationship, professional comedy writer Les Candalero melts into a puddle of self-doubt. He made her laugh; what could have gone wrong? Even finding a new flame to validate himself won\u2019t work, since he\u2019s too unsure of himself to even begin negotiations. That is, until he sees an ad in the back of an old book; a tonic that will grant the user a sense of humor that will be impossible for women to resist. The product works \u2014 too well and Les soon begins to resent his purchase. It casts doubt on the only thing he ever prided himself on, his sense of humor. Are they laughing at him or the tonic? He sets out to flush this aphrodisiac out of his system and return stasis -- or at least honest laughs -- to his world. This proves problematic, and he realizes his error was not trying to find honest laughs but needing the laughs so badly in the first place. Can he still be funny without needing a laugh to survive? Can he be more? Does this hat look funny?\nWhy should you help us make it though? Very good question.\nSCRIPT: We've been honing it for a couple of years: writing, getting feedback, tweaking. After lots of hard work, we're very proud of the results. Don't just take our word for it though, \n\"When I first saw the treatment for 'The Origins of Wit and Humor', I realized my initial hope of an action-comedy buddy movie with Nicolas Cage and The Rock searching for an ancient Ark of Laughs guarded by a Middle-Eastern-accented Jack Black would not come to fruition. However, I then read the script--and what I found inside was far better than anything that could have been hiding in that Ark of Laughs. Christian and Hunter's distinct voice is part-Woodyesque wit, part-slapstick, part-raunchy, and all hilarity. In addition, their clever integration of the evolution of comedy, along with a Midwestern sensibility that only a local could depict, makes 'TOWH' a film I truly cannot wait to come to life. The Dimestore duo has been making me laugh with their shorts for a few years, but 'TOWH' proves that their writing is meant for the silver screen.\" \n-- Mike Burke. Mike came on board to CoProduce The Origins of Wit & Humor Trailer. He has also produced television shows for the History Channel and Biography Channel as well as coproducing, writing and directing short films in Chicago.\nThe script alone has gotten us the offer of help from some very competent individuals and a few meetings with production companies. The best compliment we've gotten (repeatedly) is that the script is \"laugh out loud funny\" and has heart, and that's coming from people who don't owe us anything.\nTIME SENSITIVE: The script is very personal -- both in the minutiae of the humor, but also in the emotional content. Being comedy writers ourselves there are honest pieces of us in there. From our attempts to make our main character three dimensional to the examination of our own insecurities. Because of that we want to make it ourselves and make it now. If we made in 5 years would it still be funny? Yes. However there's an immediacy and an intensity that we want to shine through. We're going to make this film as our original vision, and while it still resonates with us.\nQUALITY: The prevailing wisdom may be that you should write to your limitations. If you don't have the money to shoot someone's dream, just shoot them talking about their dream. That doesn't sound like something either of us would like to watch, so we don't have any interest in making you watch it. While we don't have any explosions or monsters, we do intend on making this something worth giving your full attention to. We want this film to have some scope. Through our years of making shorts we know we can make something relatively contained and have consistently flexed our DIY filmmaker skills to make something out of nothing. With this feature we want to finally make something bigger. Create something out of something.\nWe'll be shooting on the amazing RED series of cameras, which are the some of the same cameras used to shoot The Hobbit, Pacific Rim, and Prometheus. What that means is that we'll have a very slick looking visual product, not to mention that Peter Jackson price tag flavor...without the price tag part. \nCOLLABORATORS:\nShatterglass Studios - Shatterglass is an award winning new media development and film and video production company based out of Champaign-Urbana. Once funds are raised, they will be co-producing as well as donating their RED cameras, which is already saving us a lot of money. \nLuke Anderson - Luke is an extremely talented, versatile composer who will be scoring the film. He has a formal degree in music composition, performed in a number of musical acts, conducted orchestras, and composed music for a variety of genres of film. We've worked with Luke for several years now, you can hear his work in many of our films. \nCameron Yergler - Cam is an Assistant Editor at the Chicago post production company Cutters. His work there led him to a 2012 AICE nomination in the \"Best of Chicago\" category for a short documentary he edited entitled, \"Jett.\" Outside of Cutters his work has been seen at the following high profile film festivals: Sundance, Tribeca, Chicago International, and Seattle International.\nYou! - Whether that's your art on screen, your vote that's led to a prop choice, that character you named, or even that scene where you walk into the bar, you can contribute to the film! Your opinion is valued.\nWhat's in it for you?\nYou're a straight shooter. We respect that, so since you asked, there are a few things:\n1) Excellent prizes and incentives! Look at that list to right, pretty neat huh? We want you to take something away from this beside the warm feeling you'll get from making our dream come true.\n2) You're also going to get new, original, and exclusive video content, regardless of the donation level. We don't want to just have an update of how close we are to our goal and how we need more donors. We'll do some of that, but we want to give you a reason to be interested. We want you to know we appreciate any consideration you guys can give us.\n3) Participation. We like feedback. Take a close look at the incentives. There are a few gifts that allow you directly contribute to the project creatively.\nPlay the role of art director: contribute your work to dress our sets and be seen on camera.\nSwim in the think tank: Vote on some creative decisions for the film (e.g. prop design, costume choices, etc.)\nOr just name a character (within reason and taste).\n4) All joking aside, you have our sincerest thanks. Obviously, this project means a lot to us, but making this is the culmination of nearly a decade of working together. Everything has been building toward telling this larger story and we're excited to see what comes next. We're not foolish enough to think we can do it on our own. Whatever you can give, every little bit means a whole lot.\nWhat is the money for?\nIt's not a shock to anyone that making a feature length film costs a lot of money. This $15K we're attempting to raise is a portion of what we hope the final budget will be. What we plan to do with this seed money is attract further investors and talent and further investors based on that talent.\nWe had a producer who has worked on films in LA break down our script he gave us a budget estimate of $100K. Coming from our independent and DIY filmmaking background we know we can make it just as good for way less. We ultimately hope to have a final budget around $50K. Could we make it for $30K? Most definitely. Could we do it for $20K? Sure. But if we're gonna go for it lets go for it. Come hell or high water, the film gets shot this fall. The more money we get from the Kickstarter, the more hair we have in the Christmas Cards.\nWe're not asking you to give us YOUR money to play with while we keep OUR assets protected. We're all in on this. Much of our savings and if need be, selling our stuff, is on the line.\nBut what does the money go to? Everything. Here are a few things that go into preproduction and production of a film: booking locations, paying actors and if need be, housing them, paying crew, feeding those folks just mentioned, transportation, buying/building props and costumes, equipment rentals, all this and more...and we haven't even touched postproduction and festival entry fees yet. \nIncentives on Display & Delivery Details\nHandmade supporter magnet! Yep you're seeing that right, they are printed on old records! Vinyl on vinyl!\nSharp looking Limited Edition Backer Shirt! (Initial mock up)\nDimeStore Backer\nTonic ad from the Film (Option 1) - Limited Edition Print by Steve Salgado\nTonic ad from the film (option 2) - Limited Edition Print by Steve Salgado\nWe have a healthy mix of stuff we can give you right away and stuff we have to wait to give you. Obviously, most digital rewards can get there right away. Physical stuff (t-shirt, magnet, print, etc.) we have to wait till the campaign is finished to get our order size, THEN package and ship. Anything that's dependent on the production (behind the scenes diaries, copies of the movie) will have to wait till post production at the earliest. Our estimated delivery dates are just that. Estimates. We'll keep you updated throughout the process and be as transparent as possible.\nHow Kickstarter Works\nHey, look at that! To the right! That column is a list of rewards for contributing to our project. Whatever you choose to donate, you'll have our sincerest thanks and take home some really nifty prizes. You'll even get a chance to collaborate on the film.\nYou can donate anything over $1, not just at the prescribed levels, those are just the thresholds for cool stuff. Pick a contribution level you feel comfortable with and your donation will be processed through Amazon Checkout. Nothing will be charged until we reach our goal.\nWe can't stress this enough but Kickstarter is ALL OR NOTHING. If we don't hit our goal, we don't get any of the donations and no incentives go out. And that's not even mentioning the emotional ramifications of Christian and Hunter having tender hearts. It's important to spread the word and get others involved if you like the project.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAny feature film is a mammoth undertaking. It's a precisely timed collaboration of scheduling, budgeting, and on the fly problem solving. Any problems that arise can be fixed with money, but when you're below the microbudget realm, you dont have that luxury. The production needs to be moving forward constantly. Fortunately, we have a number of factors working in our favor:\n\nShatterglass has previously produced feature films and, in addition to providing cost saving gear, will be providing their knowledge and experience.\n\nOur own DIY experience - We're used to keeping costs low and filling multiple roles on set. We know how to keep the process moving even when external factors are working against us.\n\nIntimacy with the Script - We've spent a lot of time with this story.

I graduated from The Kubert School in 2008. Since then I have been working full-time on various projects ranging from comics and graphic novels, to advertising illustration, graphic design, and more.\n Twenty years ago I was asked what I wanted to do for a living when I grew up. My answer was \"I want to draw comics.\"\n After a few years of working on other peoples' projects, I have come to the conclusion that I HAVE to get my own projects out there.\n Pitching a non super-hero genre book can be tough to sell in the comics industry. There is a limited number of publishers that might take on a project like this. Add to that the fact that it's difficult, if not impossible, for an unknown author/ artist to get the green light for any project. In a nutshell, that's why I'm Kickstarting this project. My hope is to self-publish and see where the project goes after that. If I can get a publisher on-board, then great, I can focus on the next issue.\n The thing I love about Kickstarter is that it gives new stories and voices outside of the mainstream a chance to thrive. This project is a perfect example of that. Your funds will help pay for the art needed to finish this book. Please help support a worthwhile indie comic project and pledge today to receive your exclusive limited edition copy of FASTBACK.

Once I have the funds I can really start getting into drawing pages and production can really begin. I have worked on this book, perfecting the story and script over six years and it is finally ready to be drawn. It just requires the funding to allow me to put aside my freelancing and devote all of my time directly to FASTBACK. Each issue will take a full month to two months to complete and have printed.\n\nIf we can raise enough money in this campaign, a project\u2026 a dream, six years in the making, will become a reality.

In the years since, they've updated the program to be, in our opinion, the single best software package for aspiring visual effects artists and filmmakers.\nHitfilm 2 combines a video editing program with a 3D/2D compositing and visual effects program like After Effects, while being cheaper and easier to learn. If you're looking for an all-in-one package to start doing visual effects, we highly recommend HitFilm 2.\nWe also worked with them in Season One to create a plug-in for HitFilm to do the derez hit effect within Field of Fire.

You can still order from our online store!\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nA 1mm thin tool\nThere are many utility tools. They accomplish many functions. But neither you nor I carry them because they are bulky. And bulky pants pockets aren't cool. Plus, for one to actually be useful, you have to remember to carry it with you...daily.\nPocketMonkey is a utility tool cut from 1mm thin stainless steel. It only occupies one slot of your wallet. So you can have it with you at all times. You don't have to remember to carry it. And there's definitely no bulk!\n10+ functions\nPocketMonkey does most of the functions seen in leading utility tools. Then adds some that are truly novel. 12 functions in all. There's no knife, so you don't have to worry about TSA getting frisky.\nEnough talk, show me this monkey business!\nA lasercut prototype. The production version will be like this, but precision stamped.\nInsert a card to make a phone kickstand.\nKeychain bottle openers are bulky! PocketMonkey is thin and opens bottles with style.\nAnd a few more...\nFinal design\nAfter several prototypes (used in product shots on this page), I have refined the design to be production ready. The final design uses 1mm stainless steel that is hardened to four times the normal strength. It is slightly smaller than a credit card, so that it can easily slide into a variety of wallet slots. It also features text reminders for each function that are laser etched as the final production step.\nPocketMonkey vs other \"wallet utility\" tools. They are thick and heavy.\nSeveral edges are smushed or \"coined\" during the stamping process to improve function by angling the edge. The letter opener, orange peeler, and micro flat-head all benefit from this process. The final edge is \"round-bladed\" to be acceptable as airplane carry-on.\nA drawing of the final production-ready version of PocketMonkey.\nReady for production!\nI have the final design ready. I have the technical drawings ready. I have the manufacturer ready. They are waiting for me to mail them a check to start production. All that is left is your support!\nWith successful funding, I am hoping to take delivery of the first production PocketMonkeys the beginning of December. That will ensure delivery to you in time for the holidays!\nAlso, I am pleased to announce that after a long search, I have found a manufacturer in California who can build this ultra-thin, high-strength device. I really wanted to keep this job in USA and it is going to happen! \nIn case you don't know how big of a deal that is, consider this: The vast majority of industrial manufacturing is now done in China. I approached many companies who said it was beyond their abilities, before I found one in the US that would accept the job.\nShow your support! Get a t-shirt!\nJust like PocketMonkey, these shirts are top quality. Screened on Next Apparel 100% combed cotton short-sleeved crew neck t-shirts. Available in both men's and women's fits. These slimming tees show your support in a subtle and stylish way!\nMen's Kelly Green: \"Is that a monkey in your pocket or are you just happy to see me?\"\nWomen's Hot Pink: \"I backed PocketMonkey and all I got is this lousy t-shirt!\"\nMen's Charcoal: \"I backed PocketMonkey and all I got is this lousy t-shirt!\"\nWomen's Turquoise: \"Is that a monkey in your pocket or are you just happy to see me?\"\nWhere did this idea come from?\nLast year, I locked myself out of my apartment. Stuck there staring at the door, I realized if I had a thin shim, I could slip the latch, since the deadbolt wasn't thrown. I fashioned one, carried it in my wallet, and low and behold, locked myself out the very next week. Yeah, I know... But the wallet tool was awesome! I asked myself, why not add other tools that would be useful to have ready at hand. That simple metal shim evolved into PocketMonkey.\nPocket knives are so 1999. Get a PocketMonkey!\nSupport me and I'll support you.\nEvery budding entrepreneur needs help to see their dreams come to life.

I have successfully prototyped the design, but there is risk that issues will arise in manufacturing the final product. To reduce this risk, I have selected a world-class manufacturer in California that is highly experienced in producing this type of product. They have reviewed my design and approved it for manufacturing. \n\nOf course, there is the possibility that they do not deliver on time or that an unforeseen production issue causes a delay. I am a Mechanical Engineer and have been working as a product designer for many years, so any issues that do arise, I feel confident that I will be able to resolve.
