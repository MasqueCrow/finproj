What a beautiful campus and mothership! Credit: Straton Roberts\nHiya! I'm Straton. As a user experience (UX) designer, I'm passionate about the beauty and usability of great design. Naturally, this makes me an Apple fanboy. I'm also a nerdy pin collector.\nLast year, I launched my first Kickstarter campaign for a set of iOS pins. I was blown away by the amount of support from people (in 11 countries!) who are also passionate about Apple. I received a ton of great feedback from my backers and those who have purchased the pins after the campaign. One theme has consistently stood out \u2014 people love feeling the digital world come to life.\nWith that theme in mind, I'd like to introduce you to my second Kickstarter campaign for a set of Mac-inspired pins and a special bonus set for WWDC 2021.\nWear 'em on your jacket, slap 'em on your backpack, jam 'em into your corkboard, or magnetize them to your fridge \u2014 the choice is yours!\n\nThis set of eight (8) unofficial enamel pins pays tribute to historical moments in the life of the Apple Macintosh and commemorates Apple's WWDC 2021 conference.\n\u2705 The $5,000 Stretch Goal unlocked June 2, 2021! The Click Wheel pin will be included for free with every \"Complete Set\" reward.\n\u23f3 If the project reaches $10,000, a new 10th pin will be included for free with every Complete Set reward. The twist? You get to decide! Right after the WWDC keynote on Monday, I will send everyone a link to a survey where you can submit your own pin ideas. Shortly after that, you'll get to vote on your favorite finalists. Let your imagination run wild!\nRewards\n1 single pin (your choice of design) - $10 \n1 full pin set (8 pins) - $40 \n2 full pin sets (16 pins) - $60 \n\nAdd-ons\niOS pin set (all 6 pins from my last Kickstarter) - +$25 \nThis add-on set includes all six (6) iOS-themed pins from my last Kickstarter.\nPaint: 3\" x 2\", black dyed, soft enamel with epoxy dome, 3 black rubber clutches or soft fridge magnet\nThe Spinning Beach Ball of Death: 1.0\", silver nickel plated, soft enamel with epoxy dome, 2 black rubber clutches or magnet w/ holder\nPhysical Escape Key: 0.68\" x 0.45\" (SAME SIZE AS THE REAL THING!), black nickel plated, 1 black rubber clutch or magnet w/ holder\nSystem 7: 0.9\" x 0.7\", black nickel plated, 1 black rubber clutch or magnet w/ holder\nDark Mode: 0.85\" x 0.75\", black nickel plated, 1 black rubber clutch or magnet w/ holder\nFinders Keepers: 0.75\" x 0.75\", black nickel plated, 1 black rubber clutch or magnet w/ holder\nWWDC21: 1.25\" x 0.37\", black nickel plated, 1 black rubber clutch or magnet w/ holder\nGlow and Behold: 0.75\", black nickel plated, 1 black rubber clutch or magnet w/ holder\nClick Wheel (Unlocks at $5,000): 1.18\", matte silver plated, 2 black rubber clutches or magnet w/ holder\nNOTE: The actual designs, materials, and dimensions may vary slightly from what is shown here, depending on if anything needs to be adjusted for the manufacturing process.\nThis is an example of what the back pin clutches will look like.

Based on my previous orders with my manufacturing partner, the actual defect rate is much lower.\n\n\nManufacturing and shipping delays:\n\nAs we've all learned this last year, it is reasonable to expect that there may be some delays in manufacturing and shipping due to circumstances out of our control.

Every track was created using only the sound chips inside of a Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) and a Gameboy (DMG).\nHere's the first cut of the full album playing on the 'Nintendo Entertainment Turntable' for your listening pleasure while you browse the project details! This is a one-off copy that was lathed so it's a bit crude compared to the polished album. The quality of the sound on the full press will be far superior to what you hear in this example. Additionally, all of the tracks have since been improved upon based on valuable feedback from friends and fellow musicians.\nI've been creating chiptune music for over a decade and have been composing video game style themes since I was a child. I've also played piano for most of my life and have always enjoyed learning how to play songs from my favorite TV shows, movies, video games, and bands. With the possibilities of using a digital audio workstation to create music, I have spent countless hours over the years arranging and composing midi based tracks. This will be my fifth album and second release on vinyl.\nAbout two years ago, backers just like you from around the world pitched in to bring my first vinyl release, \"In The RP2A Over The Sea\",  to life and they were handsomely rewarded for their support and  pledges. As with that project, I will spare no expense to create the  best album I can, complete with plenty of extras!\nA pledge of $12 or more gets you a high quality digital download of \"Soft Bits In\", including a number of digital album cover options. With a pledge of $25 or more, you get three additional full album downloads: After These Messages, Shamroctoroc, & In The RP2A Over The Sea. All digital album downloads will be delivered via email as download codes that can be redeemed at any time.\nThis reward includes an album package containing two expertly pressed black vinyl  LP records in white sleeves in a beautifully designed album jacket, all kept protected by a clear, collector-grade poly bag rather than shrink-wrapped. With this, you also receive a digital download of the album!\nThe Special Edition Vinyl Press has been designed specifically with the collector in mind. In addition to  everything that comes with the \"Vinyl Press\" reward, it includes the Deluxe Digital Album Download and the following:\nFor those interested in the process of creating the album or looking to get into making chiptune music, this two hour long, one-on-one 'master class' session will walk you through it all. I'll share what software & hardware I use, how I work within the inherent limitations, utilize creative techniques, and more! I will answer any questions you have or we can just chat about classic video games, art, music, technology, etc. This reward includes everything that comes with the Special Edition Vinyl Press.\nAfter previous album releases, I've received commissions for chiptune tracks, so I'm offering select backers the same service bundled with the Special Edition Vinyl Press in which I'll create a track just for you using the same setup I used for this album. This can be an original or an arrangement, up to five minutes in length. The recorded track will be sent to you in your preferred format when completed.\nThis is for the ultimate fan of chiptunes and vinyl - a record player built into a classic Nintendo Entertainment System! In addition to getting everything included with the Special Edition Vinyl Press, I'll create a NES Turntable just for you! It may be a novelty item with the internal components of a Crosley Cruiser but it's fully functional with multiple speeds, adjustable volume, component and headphone audio out jacks, built in speakers - and it is one heck of a conversation piece!\nIf you're a collector, you might be interested in picking up an extra copy of the album, or second Special Edition package as a special gift for someone. If you're a true collector, you'll definitely want to grab a test press of the album! For anyone who backs the \"Vinyl Press\" reward or above, you'll be able to add one of these to your pledge! For those who back at any level, you can get the same two-hour chip-tunes 'master class' included with the \"Chiptunes 101\" reward or, if you've already backed the \"Chiptunes 101\" reward, you can add more time to your session (or schedule multiple sessions).\n\nI've done meticulous calculations to determine the outcome of this project whether it barely reaches the goal or maxes out every reward. If the campaign just meets the goal, I will have a small buffer to cover anything that doesn't go according to plan. If it reaches its peak potential, however, I will be upgrading rewards!\nIf the campaign reaches $10,000 then I will be pressing the records in two different colors of vinyl - purple and yellow. Kindercore offers this option for a better cost than many other pressing plants so with just a bit extra, we can make this happen!\nAlso, as of June 14th, I've decided that an extra album insert will be included with all copies! That means standard presses will have one insert and the Special Edition will come with three! You can read this update for more info but the short version is this: this insert will follow the design of the album (purple/yellow) and contain the names of every single backer who helped bring the project to life! The more you're able to pledge, the more prominent your name will be. You will be able to choose how your name will appear, or you can choose to dedicate your spot to someone special! I'll get this info from everyone on the surveys at the end of the campaign.\nSurpassing $11,000 in funding will get the Special Edition Vinyl Press backers four more 5x7\" pixel art prints with colorful designs inspired by the lyrics of \"The Soft Bulletin\". Can you guess which songs might have inspired these designs?\n$12,000 gets all backers of $40 rewards or more a 4-in-1 sticker strip designed after the Gameboy Printer paper feed. These additional images of the band that inspired \"Soft Bits In\" look like they came fresh off the GBP press and can be cut down to smaller, individual stickers or left intact to resemble the paper strips torn from the thermal paper roll!\nAt $14,000, all albums will be upgraded with gatefold jackets. For the true double album experience, a gatefold is the perfect packaging. With this upgrade, I'll also include  a 'Special Thanks' section on the inside of the jacket where I'll list the names of everyone who backs the campaign!\n$16,000 in funding gets Special Edition Vinyl Press backers a sleek obi strip! Many collectors love these extras that are common to releases in Japan.\nAt $18,000, all Special Edition Vinyl Press albums will include a lenticular cover art insert with an interlaced image that animates an exploding Gameboy when you tilt it up and down! I haven't cemented the design quite yet but I will be working with the  company producing these to come up with the best sequence of images to take full advantage of this unique technology and this is more or less how I want the final effect to look in action.\nFor any backer who pledges $90 or more and will be receiving at least one copy of the album with their reward, I'm offering a unique high pigment color swirl variant of the records! You can read all the details in this update but a few things to note. These are limited to one-per-backer (possible exceptions for high rollers) and their appearance may vary wildly from what you see below - but this is the overall look I'll be going for. Also, if this isn't your thing and would prefer the standard black vinyl instead (or solid yellow/purple color if we reach that stretch goal), you'll have the option to opt out on the survey at the end of the campaign. I know many of you will enjoy this perk but it's not for everyone so I don't want to force it on you if you don't want it!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nEvery Kickstarter campaign has potential risks and many challenges but I've taken every precaution to ensure that whatever funding is raised will be more than sufficient to cover all costs of production and that I am well prepared to take on the challenges of fulfillment. As of now, the tracks are all completed, recorded, mastered and backed up on multiple devices. In addition, all artwork for printing the album packaging, posters, art prints, stickers, etc have been finished, formatted and ready for submission to the printers. In other words, my work here is done and all that's left is for backers to help me reach the funding goal and the production companies to do the rest!\n\nWhile I will be relying on third parties for production needs, nearly everyone that is working on the creation of the physical items is someone I have used in the past. They are reliable, professional, and have done work that exceeded my expectations so I have the utmost confidence in their ability to deliver.\n\nReward delivery dates have been conservatively set to account for unexpected snags so they will likely arrive well ahead of schedule but in the event of delays, updates will be posted regularly and digital downloads will be delivered right after the close of the campaign regardless, so you can start listening to the album right away!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 12 or more", "title": "Digital Download", "descp": "Digital download of the full album in high quality with HD digital album pixel art.\nINCLUDES:\nSoft Bits In (Download)", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jul 2021"}], "stat": ["13 backers", "Limited (87 left of 100)", "Add-ons"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 25 or more", "title": "Deluxe Digital Album Download", "descp": "Digital download of the full album in high quality with HD digital album pixel art, plus digital downloads of my \"After These Messages\", \"Shamroctoroc\", and \"In The RP2A Over The Sea\" albums.\nINCLUDES:\nSoft Bits In (Download)\nAfter These Messages (Download)\nShamroctoroc (Download)\nIn The RP2A Over The Sea (Download)", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jul 2021"}], "stat": ["7 backers", "Limited (93 left of 100)", "Add-ons"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 40 or more", "title": "Vinyl Press", "descp": "Double LP vinyl press of \"Soft Bits In\", plus digital download of the album.\nShipping is included in the pledge amount for backers in the continental United States (supplemental shipping added for international backers based on location).\nINCLUDES:\nDouble LP Vinyl Press\n(Shipping included within the U.S.)\nSoft Bits In (Download)", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["53 backers", "Limited (47 left of 100)", "Add-ons"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 60 or more", "title": "Special Edition Vinyl Press", "descp": "Everything included with the \"Vinyl Press\" and \"Deluxe Digital Album Download\" rewards, plus a set of exclusive pixel art prints, album inserts, an assortment of stickers, and as a bonus, a physical copy of my 6-panel digipak \"8-Bit Jesus\" album on CD.\nShipping is included in the pledge amount for backers in the continental United States (supplemental shipping added for international backers based on location).\nINCLUDES:\nDouble LP Vinyl Press\nAlbum Inserts\nArt Prints\nSticker Set\nBONUS: 8-Bit Jesus CD Digipak\n(Shipping included within the U.S.)\nDeluxe Digital Album Download", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["58 backers", "Limited (42 left of 100)", "Add-ons"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 100 or more", "title": "Chiptunes 101", "descp": "Everything included with the \"Special Edition Vinyl Press\" reward, plus we'll schedule a two hour long 'master class' session where I'll answer questions and show you how I made the album.

CAN WE REACH OUR THIRD & FINAL STRETCH TARGET OF \u00a330,000?!\n\nWe have reached our second stretch target of \u00a325,000! Thank you so, so much for believing in us and our dream of making this documentary.\n\nWith only 24-hours to go, now is the time for the final push. If you've been thinking about supporting us then every donation (seebelow) will really, really help us push forwards with our documentary to tell the untold stories of Scottish girl bands.\n\nCould we reach our third stretch target of \u00a330,000? It would allow us to do everything we want to make the best documentary possible.\n\nOur next MAJOR GOAL is to actually FINISH MAKING THE FILM in time for launch at festivals like Glasgow Film Festival in March 2022 ...  not an easy task. The average Netflix documentary costs \u00a3300k+. \n\nSo we still need support.\n\nWe have some STRETCH GOALS which, should we reach them, will help us make the best film possible \u2013 something that really does justice to the cause, whilst celebrating the music and the incredible bands behind it.\n\n STRETCH GOAL 1 \u2013 \u00a320k - MET (THANKS SO MUCH)This will help us secure AS MUCH PRECIOUS VIDEO ARCHIVE AS POSSIBLE (it can cost up to \u00a33k to clear one minute of archive for theatrical, broadcast and streaming release. Expensive right?)\n   STRETCH GOAL 2 \u2013 \u00a325K - MET (THANKS SO MUCH) This will give us the chance to include a few more tunes, which in turn, also supports the artists... as well as bring an archive producer on board part-time to help with sorting out commercial footage licenses, royalties, publishing fees etc in order to make sure no stone is left unturned...\n   STRETCH GOAL 3 \u2013 \u00a330K: This will enable us to enlist the help of an animator full time for 4 weeks to create bespoke content for use in the film where the archive that's sadly already lost would have been, bringing the story to life and providing visual representation for the  'movements that might have been' had these women been given the same  support as their male counterparts.\n  We can\u2019t even imagine being so lucky but to  reach these goals but if we did we could commit to preserving a definitive catalogue of  everything that\u2019s out there, from stills, to audio recordings, rare  interviews, TV appearances, John Peel sessions... and provide the best  possible platform for these bands to tell their stories in their own  words. \nABOUT \n'Since Yesterday: The Unsung Pioneers of Scottish Pop' celebrates the songs,  stories and journey of Scotland's all-female bands from 1960 to 2010. \nThis feature-length documentary seeks to explore the social impact of women making music collectively in a male-dominated industry and rightfully acknowledge their place within the history of popular music.\n\nLungleg, by Graham Gavin\nWith over 40-hours of new footage recorded, we now need your help to push our feature length documentary \u2018Since Yesterday - The Unsung Pioneers of Scottish Pop\u2019 in to a bigger arena. This is our little country's perspective on a global issue.\n\nTHESE STORIES NEED TO BE TOLD; THIS DOCUMENTARY NEEDS TO BE MADE\u2026.\n(TW) There are some incredible things about a legion of undersold Scottish girl bands that might surprise you: John Peel sessions, concerts in prisons, cult followings, opening for The Beatles and The Sex Pistols, world tours, \u2018handbag\u2019 roadies, a little guitar cameo from Jimmy Page, even more John Peel sessions.\nThe Ettes - Scotland's first all girl 'punk' band, Edinburgh 1979 (Photo Courtesy of A. Morrison)\n\nThere are also things that, sadly you won't be surprised to hear; a world of sexual assault, getting fired for becoming a parent, being told you\u2019re too old, too fat, too short, too tall or \u201cthe problem with girl bands is that you all just get pregnant in the end...\u201d\n\nA story is always best when it is told by the people at the heart of it; Strawberry Switchblade, The McKinleys, The Twinsets, The Ettes, Lungleg, Sophisticated Boom Boom, His Latest Flame, The Hedrons and TeenCanteen, plus many more.\nSophisticated Boom Boom, by Simon Clegg\nThe McKinleys\nScotland's musical output is world reknown; yet whenever women work collectively, their output is curtailed, compromised out of existence, or just left unsigned. Why?\n\nThe statistics are hard to stomach. The story doesn\u2019t seem to be changing.\nThere is anger, hurt, desire, determination and fierce passion for change. There are movements, campaigns and hard evidence in report form. #MeToo, Key Change, #womeninmusic and Vick Bain\u2019s report on diversity in the music industry. \nWe started this documentary because we want to shine a light on the issues, but also, as hard as some of the story is to hear, we want to celebrate the determination, the individuality, the occassional success, the history of these incredible women, their music and these brilliant bands. We can\u2019t continue to write women out of the history of music. There will be bands and stories like this in every city and country across the world.\nPlease help us tell this story. It needs to be told.\nTwinsets 2018 EIF\nWHY NOW? \nThe music industry may consider itself culturally progressive but at PRS for Music, only 17% of its 140,000 registered members are female (2018). Similarly, 108 (17.5%) of the 616 songwriters nominated for Best Single Brit Award since 1999 have been women. 14.18% of the 12,040 writers represented by UK publishers are women, while female artists make up 19.69% of the rosters of acts signed to labels. This is also an industry that\u2019s been slower to reckon with its abusers post-#MeToo than other art forms.\nLastly, the festival line ups recently announced for 2021 are woefully under representative of all-female acts. In the sixty years since women demanded equal rights in every sphere, not all that much has changed for women with guitars.\n\nNow it\u2019s time to put us and our story front and centre. The game changers, the rule breakers, the iconoclasts, the ones who never compromised. Why? Because the system is broken and it\u2019s high time, we changed the record\u2026\n\nTHE TEAM / WHERE WE'RE AT: \nCo-directed by musician Carla J. Easton (shortlisted for Scottish Album of the Year; member of all girl band TeenCanteen) and prominent Scottish director Blair Young; produced by producer/filmmaker Miranda Stern (one of Scottish Documentary Institute\u2019s New Voices of 2020) and the award-winning production company The Forest of Black. We\u2019ve been soldiering on for four years now with nothing but blood, sweat and tears to fuel the drive. We have over 40 hours of new footage, having tracked down and interviewed and struck up friendships with these pioneers and trailblazers. They have openly shared the highs, lows, heartbreaks and outrages of their chequered musical history. Now we just need a little help to get it over the finishing line\u2026\nWe have invested 4-years of personal time and money into this project. We now need \u00a325,000 or more to unlock the buried chest of archive that lies in television vaults, and license other material to help colour the film to its best potential.\nWe know the interest is there \u2013 we\u2019ve been selected for In Edit festival and we have interest from broadcasters and distributors.\nWe've just received a development grant from Creative Scotland to develop, research and write this documentary, allowing us to employ key personnel and extend our research professionally; however it is not a production fund, and with the prohibitive cost of rare archive from broadcasters, we can't pay for everything out of our own pocket. \nIf we can obtain this important footage and music for our documentary, it effectively releases it in to the public realm, collated nicely in our film.\n\nWe are seeking to raise \u00a325-\u00a330k to go towards the cost of usage rights and licensing fees for the following:\nUnreleased audio from John Peel sessions\nRare TV appearances from, amongst others, Something Else; Ready Steady Go!; Top of the Pops \nStills\nMechanical royalties and publishing fees\nCost of rewards for our Kickstarter supporters\nREWARDS\nEXCLUSIVE MUSIC, MERCH, TEST PRESSINGS AND EXPERIENCES ALL AVALABLE\nLimited Edition Ettes Cassettes of never before released demos, Signed Debut Album TeenCanteen, Limited Edition The Twinsets 7\" Pink Picture Disc, Lung Leg Screen Printed T-Shirt and 7\" Bundle, Private Screening Tickets for 2, Shout Outs in Credits, your chance to be an Executive Producer, Bands Names T-Shirts and Limited Edition Bespoke Film Poster - loads of items in return for your support to make this film happen. \nEttes Live Review, Mark Hagen (supplied by Lindsay Hutton)\n\nIf funding exceeds our original target, the money will go towards our postproduction costs (we will also be seeking additional finance to cover this). The stories are there, recorded, nearly good to go. We just need to get it out there.\nEvery single donation will help us get closer to getting this story out there. If you can make a contribution and share our Kickstarter then we would be incredibly grateful.\nNeedless to say, you\u2019ll have our thanks and HUGE HUGS when allowed. \n\nIt's time to provide accessible historical context to women making music.

After a lot of product development and so many noodles eaten, we are ready to launch it. Backers of the ABO Ramen product launch campaign will be the first to try it and will also help with:\nLab work - all the tests and analyses that are necessary to distribute a new food product. Think things like shelf-life studies.\nRaw ingredients - while some ingredients we do have in stock for our other product lines, some are entirely new and in order to purchase the quantities needed for mass production, it's a pretty big investment.\nPackage development - we know about jars and pouches, but boxes and sachets are new to us. We are working on the best packaging option for our new product.\n\nThe Problem \nWe get it.\nYou\u2019ve been busy with your 10th Zoom meeting today, the emails are piling up, and you\u2019ve only finished half of what\u2019s on your to-do list. The last thing you want is to spend 45 minutes prepping, cooking, and cleaning the dishes when you\u2019ve had a long, tiring day.\nSo you go to the kitchen and cook 3-minute instant ramen. Now that\u2019s yummy and fast. The problem is, you bought that very unhealthy pack from your grocery store, and for a WFH goal-getter like you, you realized you needed something healthier.\nSo now you wanted to level up your ramen game and decided to go for a healthier option. Still, you needed it ninja fast so you tried looking for a quick and healthy ramen fix. Big Problem: that \u201cdelicious factor\u201d is missing the equation.\nWe see you. And we know just what you need:\nWhat if we reinvent ramen so you can have a meal that\u2019s fast, healthy, and absolutely delicious?\nIntroducing, ABO Ramen! \nABO Ramen is a delicious, easy, 100% GUILT-FREE ramen meal kit! The kit will contain miso-based ramen broth seasoned with our award-winning OKAZU condiment and wheat-free noodles. Umami yum!\nOur new ABO Ramen is a great choice compared to regular instant, or restaurant ramen, which are very high in fat and sodium. ABO Ramen is non-GMO, gluten-free (wheat-free), contains no artificial flavouring, and is completely plant-based.\n\nLet's Talk About Our Souper Healthy Miso-Based Ramen Broth\nYou and ABO Ramen FER-MENT to be!\nIf you don\u2019t know by now, We L-O-V-E miso for so many reasons.\nWe are all about adding depths of flavor to food while loading it up with nutrition to keep you satisfied and nourished even on days when you literally have a few minutes to prepare your meal.\nFor ABO Ramen, we are using a rich, flavorful, and naturally fermented miso soup base to give you that much-needed probiotic boost in the most delicious way. Yes to gut health and improving your overall mental and physical wellness!\nMiso is also rich in essential minerals and is a good source of Vitamins B, E, K, and Folic Acid, so much good stuff for your body. \nSo on those Mondayest-Mondays-that-ever-Mondayed kind of days, you know you have a quick way to power though your day.  ABO Ramen Miso goodness all the way!\n\nGame-Changing Lean Ramen\nHow about we take a peek at that fitness essential checklist of yours?\nYoga mat, check. Adaptogens, check. Now add this: ABO Ramen, check!\nWe\u2019re innovating the reasons why people consume ramen, and we\u2019re doing this, one high-protein ABO Ramen bowl at a time.\nABO Ramen's vegan protein noodles are made from a green lentil base and has at least 22 grams of plant-based protein (the final product may have more) which is equal to a glass of protein smoothie (standard smoothies contain 20g to 25g of protein per scoop of powder). Your post-workout meal will never be the same again! \nImagine enjoying a warm, hearty bowl of ramen after every workout to fuel up, recover and build muscles? Talk about ultimate fitness goals & foodie dream combined!\nSo when they say \u201cabs are made in the kitchen\u201d, now you know ABO Ramen is one solid proof to that!\n\nYou Think You Know Umami\n...until you try ABO Ramen.\nABO Ramen has a rich umami flavour \u2013 the key to any delicious ramen \u2013 but unlike other ramens, we use only plant-based ingredients.\nAside from our incredibly tasty miso-based broth, we are adding our award-winning OKAZU condiment to ABO Ramen to create that delicious complexity of flavour and perfect umami bomb that elevates your entire ramen experience. \nYour dream ramen could finally exist in reality (almost, we need your help to make it happen!)\n\nFlavor In, Sodium Out!\nFACT: We are ramen-obsessed like you, but the truth is, most traditional instant ramen brands out there are loaded with less than ideal ingredients including salt-laden powder packets made in big factories. So harmful for your health.\nNo need to worry, ABO Ramen has 80% less sodium than regular ramen. It is also minimally processed and made only from REAL food.\nBest of all, we didn\u2019t compromise that familiar, satisfying, savory ramen flavor you love coming back to. Ahhh, perfect nourishing meal especially in this difficult pandemic time!\nSo next time your taste buds crave some piping hot ramen brimming with flavor, you can drop the guilt because you can eat ABO Ramen everyday!\n\nUpcycled Ingredients\nAs a company, we\u2019re all about fighting food waste and creating a positive impact to the environment. We are a part of the Upcycled Food Association (UFA), which is an organization that elevates food to its highest and best use.\nAccording to the United Nations, \u201cReducing food losses and waste is essential in a world where the number of people affected by hunger has been slowly on the rise since 2014, and tons and tons of edible food are lost and/or wasted every day\u201d\nLast year, our Instant Miso Soup helped divert 2 tons of sake brewing by-products. This year, we want to do more to help people and the planet.\nThat's why we are tapping into the powerful world of fermentation as a technique to create one of our key ingredients for ABO Ramen\u2014 \u201cSake Lees\u201d\nThe art of fermenting sake lees from our local brewery helps us create a food masterpiece that mitigates food waste.\nTHE RESULT: A product that is filled with new and exciting ferments, highly nutritious, has a unique flavor profile, and helps divert food waste\n\nWhat's in the box?\nEach kit contains two servings of ABO Ramen, complete with:\ntwo portions of ABO Ramen noodles, made with green lentil and quinoa (it tastes waaaay better than it sounds)\ntwo pouches of umami-rich ABO Ramen miso soup broth seasoned with our award winning OKAZU miso chili oil\n\nNutrition Facts\nHere's the nutrition facts for our latest prototype. We know it's already really good, but we're trying to pack in even more protein and nutrients, without compromising the taste, of course.\nIngredients\nGreen lentil, quinoa, Organic  miso paste (ORGANIC SOYBEANS, RICE, SALT), Sakekasu, OKAZU (SUNFLOWER OIL,  SESAME OIL, GARLIC, MISO PASTE {ORGANIC SOYBEANS, RICE, SALT}, TAMARI  SOY SAUCE {NON-GMO SOYBEANS, SALT, SUGAR}, ORGANIC CANE SUGAR, CHILI  POWDER, WHITE SESAME SEEDS, CHICKPEA FLOUR), salt.\n**Some ingredients may not be present in the final product, but no new ingredients will be added to this list.**\nRewards\nAs a company, we are very proud of our products, we consider them our work of art. Our community continues to inspire us to make vegan, gluten-free, non-GMO products that also have a positive impact on the environment.\nAs our thank you for your support, our backers can enjoy our Sofi Gold Award 2020 OKAZU condiment, our food-waste diverting Instant Miso Soup, our wild organic ceremonial grade ABO Matcha and immerse in a special cultural experience called \u201cKintsugi Class\" or the Japanese art of mending broken pottery with gold.\n\nOur Award-Winning OKAZU CHili Condiment (Chili Miso, Curry and Spicy Chili Miso)\nOKAZU is an umami-rich chili, miso, and sesame oil-based condiment often eaten with rice in Japan, which can also be used to top chicken, burgers, fish, eggs, potatoes, and more.\nUse it as a marinade or as an ingredient in your own homemade salad dressing, this condiment is versatile and we encourage you to experiment.\nOKAZU gained an initial following at farmers' markets in Toronto and has been featured in The Toronto Star, The National Post, Toronto Life, FoodiePages, and is a winner of the Foodie Pick Awards and prestigious gold Sofi Award winner in 2020.\nOur Healthy and Delicious Instant Miso Soup (Original, Black Pepper, Chili)\nOur Instant Miso Soup is made with nutrient-rich sakekasu, the by-product of making Japanese sake. In Japan, miso soup is something we eat everyday, usually in the morning, to keep a healthy and nutritious diet. \nAbo Matcha: Organic, Ceremonial grade Uji matcha\nThis is the best matcha you will every try. It\u2019s not just about an organic certification, but rather it is a philosophy to live with and preserve our Mother Earth.\nABO Matcha is certified organic in Canada, USA, and EU, but it is so much more than \u201corganic matcha\u201d. It is grown in Wazuka town, in the Uji region of Kyoto, Japan where tea farming has an 800 year history, starting during the Kamakura-era (1185-1333AD). The area\u2019s tea became known as \u201cUji-matcha\u201d and is of such high quality that during the Edo-era (1603-1868AD), it was reserved for consumption by the Emperor. Currently, Wazuka produces 50% of all tea produced in Kyoto, also Wazuka produces 40% of Uji-matcha.\nSpecial Collaborator\nWe are offering a very special kintsugi experience as part of our pledge rewards. \nYoshiko sensei was our pottery teacher in Tokyo and she also teaches kintsugi, the Japanese art of mending broken pottery with gold. Supporters who select this pledge for this reward will have a private online class with Yoshiko sensei. All the required materials for the class, including some broken antique pottery, will be supplied to the participant beforehand.\n\nAllocation of funds raised (plus if it's over)\nTo bring ABO Ramen to market we need to do some final testing and scale up production. Your Pledge will be used for necessary lab tests, such as a shelf-life study. It will also help us invest in the ingredients and packaging we need to launch.\nIf this campaign exceeds our target of $10,000CAD, we will also accelerate our wholesale distribution plan, start work on a new flavour, and enhance our community outreach by developing more recipes and other fun ramen-related content.\nDelivery Timeline\nWe expect to start shipping rewards by the end of August 2021.\nAbout Abokichi\nThe launch of ABO Ramen follows our exciting gold Sofi Award in 2020 for our OKAZU chili miso oil! We love that people enjoy and eat our products every day, and we hope you will be among the first to eat our delicious, healthy ABO Ramen.\nAbokichi is dedicated to sharing the creativity which can emerge when different cultures interact. Abokichi  means \"Fortunate Avocado,\" a coinage from \"abogado\", a South American fruit which has found a place in cuisines all over the world, and \"kichi\" which means fortunate in Japanese, to express the blessing of the diversity of different cultures in the world.\n\nOur Team\nJess, Fumi, and Bobby\nThe Abokichi story story began when we, Jess and Fumi, met in Tokyo, fell in love, and enjoyed eating our way through the city. After relocating to Toronto, we decided to start a business to share some of the delightful tastes and traditions of Japan with a North American market. Abokichi started out selling at farmers markets, then opened a small brick and mortar shop, and eventually focused on delicious and high quality grocery products. Along the way we welcomed Bobby to the team. He is in charge of  production and logistics.\nToday, the three of us entrepreneurs work tirelessly, along with our dedicated team, to deliver you healthy and delicious Japan-inspired food.\nThank you!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nProject is Delayed or Fails to Launch\nThese are common risks when producing any new product.

My name is Alia Synesthesia, I am an operatic classically trained singer and a one-woman chaotic powerhouse. I am a composer, performer, multi-instrumentalist, designer and developer. I run live/stream series called Horror & Opera where I perform operatic/instrumental improvisation to public domain horror films LIVE or via twitch streams online. I have been running Horror & Opera since 2019. \nOn April 30th 2021, I performed a live Horror & Opera twitch stream where I showcased my original score of Haxan (1922). The event received incredibly flattering feedback, and I decided to organize this Kickstarter campaign in order to create a professional, studio-quality re-scoring of Haxan and offer my soundtrack on DVD together with the film, since Haxan is in public domain. \nWhy so cheap? \nI do everything myself: operatic singing, instruments (cello, bass, drums, synth), production and design. All I need is time, since, like many others, I work full-time to make the ends meet, and I would greatly appreciate time off work to bring this project to fruition.  \nWhat's in it for you?\nA lot of things! First and foremost, you are supporting a one-woman powerhouse! But secondly, you get some neat perks too.  \nWith $5 pledge you get an official 'Thank You' and a zip with fantastic Haxan wallpapers made by yours truly.\nWith $15 pledge, you get a  re-scored digital version of Haxan + soundtrack download card. You can watch the fantastic restored version of the film with the new soundtrack  OR listen to my soundtrack separately on your preferred device.

Her film\u2019s breezy wit and pastel color palette disguise dark truths about national identity, gender, and coming-of-age, making it the first essential road movie about the TikTok generation.\nOn the edge of adulthood, Alma leaves her mother's home in the Netherlands and travels to her native Bosnia to visit the father she's never met. From the start nothing goes as planned. Her cousin gives her a frosty reception and mocks her easy life in the West. At the same time undeniable sexual chemistry leads Alma into a passionate affair with her cousins' best friend. As the obstacles mount, Alma stays fearlessly determined to follow her plan and find her father. She just has to figure herself out first. \nIn its breathless series of hotels, cars, buses, and waiting rooms, Take Me Somewhere Nice captures the dreary, fish-out-of-water isolation of the unfamiliar highway. An endearing update of Chantal Akerman\u2019s Les Rendez-Vous d\u2019Anna, fused with the jazzy cynicism of Wim Wenders\u2019 and Jim Jarmusch\u2019s 70\u2019s road movies, and the stark, sunlit despair of a David Hockney painting.\nAbout The Musician\nElla van der Woude is a Swiss-Dutch, Amsterdam-based musician, songwriter and composer. A versatile artist who scores movies,  has performed in bands and immerses herself in a number of projects, including the turbofolk inspired soundtrack for Ena Sendijarevic's debut feature Take Me Somewhere Nice.\nEna Sendijarevi\u0107 and Ella van der Woude in studio\nAbout the Music\nThis Soundtrack EP is comprised of 4 source music tracks and the credits music of the film. The initial idea for the music in Take Me Somewhere Nice was to make use of diegetic music only, creating music for specific scenes and places - a club in Bosnia, a clothing store in The Netherlands and a car ride with our three young protagonists. \n\"We simply let ourselves be inspired by the kind of music that would be played in these places and situations, and slightly exaggerated the features of the genres we were mimicking. Ena\u2019s guideline for the music was to underline the estrangement felt by the protagonists from their environment, amplifying their feelings of detachment from the different worlds they inhabit.\" - Ella van der Woude.\nBeing Ella\u2019s first time making techno and dance music, the music is naturally a little off and detached from its context, which contributes to giving the scenes a comic and surreal tone. \n The Album\nWhy a 10\"? The score to Take Me Somewhere Nice consists of 5 songs, and is approximately 16 minutes long. It is too much music for a 7\" and not enough music to justify a full 12\".\nThe Budget\nThe 10\" vinyl record is an oddity, and not often released these days. As such, a limited number of companies within the United States manufacture this specific size. Luckily for us we've found Pirates Press. \nBased on their minimum order requirement of 250 copies, Dekanalog has set out to produce a limited edition run of the Take Me Somewhere Nice soundtrack. In full transparency, please see our budget breakdown below: \nAdding in a small buffer for taxes and any unforeseen expenses (and because we like even numbers), we've landed at a final funding goal of $4,000.\nAbout Dekanalog\nLaunched in March 2021 with the release of Quentin Dupieux's Keep An Eye Out, Dekanalog is a film and music distribution company with an emphasis on presenting international titles for U.S. audiences; along with vinyl editions of some of our favorite film soundtracks.\nIn theaters June 11th, Take Me Somewhere Nice will be our fifth film release and first soundtrack release.

It sounds basic, but in live action cinema the camera is often moving either left to right, up or down, in or out. In stop motion animation, this is not so simple. It's almost impossible to move the camera during animation, because it would have to move such a tiny amount between each frame that it becomes unrealistic to achieve smoothly by hand. So motion control rigs and mechanisms provide the solution!\nThe motion control rigs that edelkrone manufacture will unlock camera movement for us, meaning beautifully smooth results. The start and end keyframes are set, and as we animate, it moves incrementally, changing tilt, pan, slide and focus. \nCheck out their stop motion product video below:\nExhibition Night! \u00a313,000 \nTo celebrate the film's completion, we'll hold an exhibition night where you can come and see all the models and sets on display before they head to their home planets! We'll have art from the project, from rough scribbles on notepads through to complete designs, and drinks and nibbles too. Every person who has pledged to the film will be invited. We're looking forward to seeing you there!\nWe\u2019re so grateful that you\u2019re here and considering contributing to the project! We hope the perks will be of as much value to you as your donation is to us.\nReally, genuinely, thank you for supporting us. It means the world, and we can\u2019t wait to show you what we make!\nCasting Call! \u00a311,000  - Complete!\nAt the end of Root Note, our four botanical heroes are discovered by a miner, who tries to communicate with them but fails. Root Note is told without words, just music. What we hear from the miner are shapes of sounds, but no meaningful words we can understand. We will cast a named actor to play the role of the miner for these lines. It will be a fun, exciting little easter egg in the film!\nThe Band - Signed Prints\nGroup concept art - Digital art on paper.

Here is the concept art for our five models on offer, Vine, Rocker, Flatcap, Combover and Miner.\nFive physical animation puppets available: Vine, Rocker, Flatcap, Combover and Miner. Models approx. 6-10 inches tall.\n Root Note is a stop motion short film about how finding your passion makes a harsh world more bearable. \nOn the edge of an arid slate mine, four starving plants scavenge to survive, until they accidentally discover something that allows them to thrive - jazz music.\nRoot Note is a film that celebrates difference.\nAs a strange, purple sun beats down on an even stranger landscape, we meet our four heroes on the wall of an abandoned miner\u2019s cottage.\nThey live in a world where flowers shouldn\u2019t grow. It\u2019s lunar, dusty. Stone and concrete has crushed most of what they need to live.\nEvery day, they watch an endless line of miners march to and from the quarry. They steal and scavenge what they can to survive.\nTheir routine is monotonous. Until one day they lift something unusual - a postcard from home. A picture of four happy jazz musicians having the time of their lives. In their element.\nMusicians - storyboard panel\nOur plants are inspired. They steal and cleverly assemble makeshift instruments from rusty mining equipment: a drum from oil barrels, a trumpet from some old piping.\nUsing the trudging drumbeat of footsteps, their jazz comes alive. Finally, the plants play with life and energy they\u2019ve never had before. They\u2019re loud and colourful. They have a place in this world.\nOur protagonists are a ragtag, motley jazz group. They\u2019re psychedelic and unusual - they don\u2019t fit in here at all.\nTheir character design is inspired by real plants that exist on earth (there are some truly mind blowing ones!). Our characters aren\u2019t going to be a single recognisable species of plant - they\u2019re unique. Each will have distinct ways of expressing themselves despite the world around them - with lots of creativity and flair.\n\nVine | Piano\nVine is the leader of our group. They are a tangle of long tendrils - resourceful, and an excellent pickpocket. Their long vines can effortlessly branch out and lift objects from far away. It is this that allows our gang to gather what they need to survive.\n\n Rocker | Double bass \nTall and lanky, Rocker\u2019s main feature is a mushroomy mess of woolly hair. Even though they are the tallest, they are quite shy. Rocker\u2019s expression is in their roots, which act as arms.\n\n Combover | Trumpet \nCombover is the short, rotund member of the group. Their wispy cactus fluff blows over from one side, giving them the appearance of a combover. Two central flowers give them two bright eyes that protrude outwards.\n\n Flatcap | Drums \n Flatcap is the loud, wild member of the bunch. Their distinctive feature is a large, overhanging floral \u2018flat cap\u2019. Two thin branches give them excellent arms for drumming.\n Miners | Ensemble cast \nWe want our miners to be totally alien - we\u2019ll see them through our heroes\u2019 point of view. It should be as difficult to determine their gender, race, as it would be for us to determine that of a flower. Their heavy overcoats, strange machinery and gas masks hide any indication of who they are. Their uniforms strip them of any individual identity.\nOur story is about the joy we feel when, despite a world that doesn't seem to care, we find our passion.\nWhen the world works against you, it wears you down. The path of least resistance is often to change - to fit in. To live up to the weight of others\u2019 expectations.\nRoot Note is a story about doing the opposite. It\u2019s about being loud and passionate and proud when the world wants you to downplay what makes you you. There is a joy in finding your passion - and that deserves to take up space. It deserves to be heard.\nAnd what\u2019s louder than a jazz trumpet echoing around a cavernous slate quarry?\nJazz is about improvising and collaborating - taking turns in the spotlight. Being in sync with one another. It\u2019s also about relying on instinct over language. Our film is told without words. It\u2019s really important to us that anybody can watch it.\nMusic is such a big part of Root Note - we knew we had to find the right musicians to bring our characters to life.\nThe Chineke! Orchestra\nThe Chineke! Foundation was established in 2015 by double bassist Chi-chi Nwanoku OBE with the mission to champion change and celebrate diversity in classical music.\nThe Chineke! Orchestra, Europe\u2019s first majority Black and ethnically diverse orchestra, made its critically acclaimed debut at the Southbank Centre in September 2015, and became an Associate Orchestra at the arts centre in September 2016. Alongside traditional orchestral repertoire, the Chineke! Orchestra enables audiences to discover work by Black and ethnically diverse composers.\nThe Chineke! Orchestra works closely with its sister ensemble, the Chineke! Junior Orchestra, with senior players acting as mentors, teachers and role models to the young musicians. In its brief and pioneering existence, Chineke! has performed at the BBC Proms, premiered works by Black and ethnically diverse composers, helped to launch stellar careers, including that of Sheku Kanneh-Mason, and won the Royal Philharmonic Society\u2019s first ever \u2018Game Changer\u2019 Award in 2019.\nChi-Chi Nwanoku OBE\nAs well as classical music, many of the members are keen jazz players. We\u2019re so excited to be recording live jazz instruments with members of the talented Chineke! Orchestra for Root Note.\nBen Squires | Composer\nBenjamin has recently had his music featured in trailers for Spider-Man: Far From Home, How to Train Your Dragon and His Dark Materials, as well as writing music for brands such as Superdry, HSBC and The Economist. Primarily, Benjamin scores films and TV, including Netflix\u2019s Tiny Creatures, additional writing for MTV's The Shannara Chronicles and countless short films.\nJuan-Miguel Hernandez | Music Consultant \nJuan-Miguel was a founder and member of the Harlem Quartet, which performed at the White House in 2008. In 2016, he was appointed as a professor at the Royal Academy of Music in London.\nHe has regularly performed with jazz living legends Gary Burton, Paquito D\u2019Rivera and Chick Corea, for which his collaborative disc won a Grammy Award. He has also collaborated on Nora Jones\u2019 album \u2018Broken Little Hearts\u2019, and is a close collaborator of five-time Grammy winner Stanley Clarke. He has played regularly as principal viola with the Chineke! Orchestra and Chineke! Chamber Ensemble. He has a strong commitment to educate and engage young people in music, and has taken part in outreach projects across the world.\nWe're animating this film using stop motion animation. That means every little thing you see on screen will be hand-made and painstakingly adjusted between frames to create movement.\nTo make stop motion look real, you need consistent light in the room. The tiniest change in light (e.g. the sun moving through the day) will cause a flickering effect that gives it away. So after a year stuck indoors, we can't wait to black out the windows and spend our summer in the dark!\nWe want to tell this story in stop motion because of the natural charm it brings to a story. There's nothing quite like seeing an object that exists in the real world move as if it's really alive. Stop motion allows for so much imagination that can be more stylised and 'hand-crafted' than CGI - perfect for endearing plants in an alien world!\nCavetown - Green\nWe have a track record animating inanimate objects! In 2019 we released a stop motion music video for Cavetown's single 'Green'. This story had some similar themes to Root Note - emphasising the importance of equal relationships, mutual respect and understanding. We really enjoyed the challenge of bringing these citrus fruits to life, and to create characters people could identify with and feel for.\nWe were overwhelmed by the response. As well as being watched by over five million people, the film also screened at London Independent Film Festival and Encounters, a BAFTA/Oscar qualifying festival in the UK. It won at the Berlin Music Video Awards for 'Best Narrative', and was honoured at The Webby Awards in the Animation category!\nWe're branching out (!) with Root Note when it comes to style and materials, but we hope the heart and emotion of our stories will stay the same.\nWRITER/DIRECTOR | GUY LARSEN\nGuy is a director born in Southend-on- Sea. His style has been described as dark, playful, irreverent and grotesque.\nIn 2016, he founded Penny4, a production company with a keen interest in making artistic, offbeat films for the internet. Combined with his love for illustration, this led him to explore animation.

But it does have a bit of a reputation for being slow and expensive! One shot - sometimes not even a second long - can take a whole day to animate. That's a lot of time and commitment. \nBut we love it! And so we're only fundraising to cover our project expenses as filmmakers. Mostly costs associated with the materials, the kit needed for such a long shoot and to make our music the best version of itself.

We are in the best possible place to shoot this film - we have a wonderful, dedicated team volunteering their time and skills to make this happen, we have the Penny4 studio and hopefully, with your help, we will have the resources we need to bring our characters to life. \n\nWe can't, however, control Covid. We're hopeful that over the summer, we'll have all been vaccinated and case numbers will be low. But on the off-chance we have another wave, we have to be prepared to push the project back. After all, stop-motion requires handling sets and models!\n\nHappily, whilst this would affect timeline, it won't affect whether or not this project happens. We're so lucky to have the Penny4 studio. We can build our sets and characters and keep them safe for a time where we can all bundle in the studio together again. We don't have to worry about booking out expensive non-refundable locations and camera equipment.

Not only is it the directorial debut of the extraordinary Aramaki Shinji (Bubblegum Crisis, Megazone 23 III, Appleseed, Ghost in the Shell: SAC 2045, just to name a few), it was also the first title AnimEigo released, well over 30 years ago!\nMADOX is one of our personal favorites because it not only combines action and comedy with realistic mechanical designs, but also delivers a powerful moral lesson -- \"Read the @^#^@ Manual\".\nWe have wanted to release MADOX in HD for many years, but have been unable to do so because suitable film assets were not available. Everyone thought they had been lost, but in reality the original print was at Tokyo Genz\u014dsho, sitting in the bottom of a locked filing cabinet stuck in a disused lavatory with a sign on the door saying \"Beware of the Leopard Tank\", wondering why all the other OVAs were getting released in HD and it wasn't.\nAs far as we can tell, the only record of its location was mangled by a manically depressed fax machine, and only the heroic efforts of our crack team of Combat Archaeologists managed to uncover the truth.\nAt which point, we emailed Tokyo Genz\u014dsho and the reply was, \"Yeah, sure, we've got it. Also, we like Gojira.\"\nThe TLDR\nWe'll be doing things in much the same way as our previous Anime Kickstarters, so everything should be familiar to you because you backed those, didn't you? As usual, the goal is to do a definitive reference edition of the title. The Basic Blu-ray will be packed with everything MADOX-related we can dig up, and the Premium Set will add a detailed artbook and a chipboard case. We'll be doing one of our embroidered patches, and may do extra goodies if there is enough interest. As with our previous releases, this will be a limited edition, one pressing, and once it's gone, it's gone!\nOVA Synopsis\nIn the first test of a revolutionary personal battle-suit, the MADOX-01, Ace female test-pilot Kusumoto Elle smashes an attacking tank force and humiliates Lt. Kilgore, Japan's most-macho tank-jockey, in the process.\nKilgore swears he'll get even, and he gets his chance when the prototype MADOX literally falls off the back of a truck in the middle of Tokyo.\nMeanwhile, the MADOX, which fell off the back of one truck, off a bridge, and into the back of another truck, has found its way into the hands of college student Sugimoto K\u014dji. Intrigued by the MADOX, K\u014dji makes the big mistake of fooling with it without reading the manual first, and soon finds himself locked in the suit and zooming around downtown Tokyo.\nUnfortunately, the homing signal the now-active MADOX transmits results in a no-holds-barred response by Kilgore; even more unfortunately, even though K\u014dji doesn't know how to fight, the MADOX does a pretty good job on automatic (it's got \"Full Self Driving\" capability), resulting in a firefight the likes of which the local residents haven't seen since the last time Gojira hit town.\nConcerned about the property damage being caused to some of the world's most expensive real-estate, Elle dons a second prototype MADOX and tries to find and rescue K\u014dji before Kilgore's many minions totally trash Tokyo.\nAnd apart from the attempts to destroy the suit (and it's driver), K\u014dji has his own problems: if he breaks his date with his girlfriend, he will lose her forever -- and he's a tad overdressed for the occasion!\nWill K\u014dji be late for his date? Or will Kilgore make him \"the late K\u014dji?\" And more importantly, is it possible to eat Convenience Store shrimp in a battlesuit? The answers to these and many other questions await you in the 41 action-packed minutes of Metal Skin Panic: MADOX-01!\nDisc Contents\nWe're packing the disc with as much content as we can gather, and the contents will almost certainly expand as we go through production. However, at a minimum, you'll get:\nA new HD transfer of MADOX-01, created especially for this edition, in both the original 4:3 presentation (pillarbox) and a 16:9 version approved by Director Aramaki.\nThe original SD \"Weapons of MADOX-01\" featurette, that describes the real-life weapons systems featured in the show.\nEnglish subtitles, both our regular colored subtitles, colored SDH subtitles, and SDH captions.\nOur English dub, with SDH captions.\nColor and Line art galleries.\nAll the bonus features included on the 2003 DVD release,  including a commentary track, two interviews (one of which is mostly Robert embarrassing himself), the original Japanese documentary, and an Easter Egg IMDB describes as a \"disturbing behind the scenes look at AnimEigo.\"\nList of all Kickstarter backers on the disc.\nNew package art designed by Director Aramaki and illustrated by Mercy Rabbit. Director Aramaki will create 3 draft designs and the backers will vote on the one that will be fully realized. Also available as a limited-edition poster in both JIS B1 and B0 sizes (the latter hand signed by the artists).\n6-panel printed insert containing a poster on one side and a list of backers on the other.\nEaster Eggs and other hidden content. Or maybe not. It'll be up to you to find out.\nAs with all our Blu-rays, the disc will not be region-locked.\nDesign sketches for the new artwork\nA frame from the transfer (click for full-resolution version)\nAbout the New Transfer\nThe new transfer of MADOX was performed under the supervision of Director Aramaki at Tokyo Genz\u014dsho from the original print of the film, and clocks in at almost 700GB of uncompressed 2K video. If the project reaches the second stretch goal, we will also perform a digital restoration pass on the film, doing additional color grading, dust and scratch removal, image stabilization, camera flicker reduction and splice removal. Film grain reduction will not be performed, as some of you have strong opinions about that... :)\nIf restoration is performed, both the original transfer and the digital restoration will be included on the disc. All additional work will be supervised by Director Aramaki.\nReward Levels\nThe @^#^@ Manual (Digital Production Materials) - $5\nOnline access to all the art and other production documentation, plus you will be listed on the disc and Amaray poster insert.\nBasic - $30+ shipping\nThe basic set, a region-free BD-25 Blu-ray + poster insert.

All backers who select this reward will get the same price as the final backer.\nDue to the way Kickstarter works (we can't change the price of a reward after someone selects it), all backers will be initially be charged what the price was when the first person selected this reward ($2500), but we will issue partial refunds shortly after the campaign concludes.\nExample of Mr. Aramaki's shikishi style. For the colored Shikishi, he plans to use colored markers on top of a greyscale Shikishi..\n\n\nAdd-ons\nWe have a tradition of producing limited-edition bonus \"goodies\" with our sets, available only to backers. They vary from set to set (we tend to do weird things backers suggest), but one thing we always do is a commemorative embroidered patch. For the Unobtainium Edition, we're going to do posters and a \"RTFM\" patch. Is that \"Read the @^#^@ Manual\" or \"Run the @^#^@ Mecha\"? You decide.\nThe patch and posters are available as an add-ons.\nIf you have an idea for a fun item, let us know. If enough of your fellow backers want one, and it won't hasten Robert's inevitable descent into madness (too much), we'll make it!\nStretch Goals\nWe're going to try something a little different this time. We've developed a menu of stretch goals, and each $25,000 raised in addition to the basic goal of $50,000 will allow the backers to collectively allocate a point towards menu selections.\nDuring the campaign, we are running a public poll so everyone can express their preferences and see what menu items are the most popular. Then, after the campaign, we'll have a private vote by the actual backers of the project to decide the final preference order (and since Robert is a voting systems nerd, we'll use his favorite system, Wright-STV)\nRegister your preferences in the poll here\nThe Current Menu\n New Commentary featuring Director Aramaki, Yamane Kimitoshi, and Koizumi Satoshi. (1 point)\n Digital Restoration Pass. The resulting restored version will be included on the disc in addition to the original transfer. (2 points)\n Madox Redux. It turns out there's a scene with an animation mistake that Director Aramaki would like to fix. We'll hire him to do so, and make any other tweaks he deems necessary. These changes will be incorporated into the restored version, and we'll create a special feature that A/B compares the changes. (2 points)\n New Trailer. Director Aramaki wants to create a new 90 second MADOX-01 trailer, with new original music and sound effects. Are we going to have to tell him \"no?\" Well, are we?! (3 points)\n Shipping Fees\nWe have World-wide English-language rights, excluding Japan, including orbits gravitationally bound to the Earth (seriously!). The ongoing drama that is Brexit has made it difficult for us to provide EU-friendly shipping, and we also have to charge VAT on UK sales now. Thus, the situation for International Backers is as follows:\n Canada: We will ship from a Canadian warehouse or direct from the USA using DDP (Delivered Duty Paid) shipping; the shipping fee includes all customs duty, taxes and fees.\n UK/EU: We will ship from a UK warehouse or direct from the USA using DDP (Delivered Duty Paid) shipping; the shipping fee includes all customs duty, fees and VAT (and is higher for this reason). \n Everywhere Else: We will ship from the USA; you will be responsible for any customs duty, taxes and fees.\nCurrently estimated shipping costs for the blu-rays:\n US: $5 for Basic sets, $7 for everything else.\n UK/EU: $25 for Basic sets, $30 for everything else.\n Everywhere Else on Earth, except Japan: $20 for Basic sets, $25 for everything else. \n Everywhere Else not on Earth: contact us for a quote.\n Japan: Don't contact us for a quote. We can't ship to Japan.\nCurrently estimated shipping costs for the posters:\n US: $10 (Priority Mail Service).\n Everywhere Else: contact us for a quote after the campaign; these items are too big to ship by USPS International First Class!\nEU customs rules are changing in Summer 2021, and we're not quite sure right now how this is going to affect shipping logistics. If it turns out we have to ship directly without DDP service, we will refund EU backers the appropriate amount to move them into the \"Everywhere Else of Earth\" category). Similarly, if something happens that significantly reduces our shipping costs, we'll make an adjustment.\nQ&A\nWhy is it the Unobtainium Edition?\nFirst, because for the longest time, the print was unobtainable. Second, because when this limited-edition goes out of print, it will become unobtainable. And finally, to build a MADOX, you need unobtainable materials. \nHow are you making the 16x9 version?\nThe raw resolution of the film transfer is 2400x1743 pixels, but as you can see from looking at a raw frame of the transfer, not all of that is actual image. For the 4:3 version, we find the largest 4:3 region of each film reel that always has image in it and scale it down to 1440x1080. For the 16:9 version, we find the largest rectangle on each film reel that always has image in it, and scale down it so it is 1920 pixels wide. This results in an image that is more than 1080 pixels tall, so for each shot in the film, we pick the 1080 pixel segment that results in the most pleasing presentation. In both cases, the film transfer resolution is higher than Blu-ray resolution, so we are always downscaling, never upscaling.\nThe 4:3 version has the full original presentation of the film, while the 16:9 version crops off a bit at the top and bottom of each frame, but presents the remainder at a higher effective resolution.\nOriginal 4x3 presentation\nFull transfer image with maximal 16x9 centered framing\nFinal 16x9 framing (adjusted vertically to maximize interesting image; in this case, so you see Kilgore's chin)", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhile we should be able to meet or beat release date, a video production project such as this can suffer unexpected delays. In particular, one side-effect of the excellent feedback we get from backers is that we expect a certain amount of \"feature creep\" as people come up with great ideas that \"simply must be done\", and these tend to stretch the schedule a bit.\n\nOur policy is that when a critical-path item causes a delay, we use that extra time to try and improve other aspects of the project. All of our previous projects have ended up shipping a few months late (each time for new and \"interesting\" reasons), but what we ended up shipping was better than what it would have been if we'd hit our schedule.\n\nThe bottom line is that we will take the time to get things right, even if that means slipping the release date, and that we will keep you fully informed every step of the way -- we typically post updates at least once a month.\n\nSome people tell us that the stories we recount about things going wrong are one of their favorite parts of our projects, but we promise we don't do it deliberately. We don't have to fake incompetence, it just comes naturally (for Robert, anyway).\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "The @^#^@ Manual", "descp": "High-resolution artwork, settei, and more.

BulletVille is going to become a reality thanks to you. \n\nAlthough time left is limited, we prepared a stretch goal for the campaign. \nIf we reach $125k, we will design a hero through a polling system with our backer community!! We are very excited to think about what the result could be!\n * Pre-alpha footage captured in-game.\n\n\nBulletVille is a badass, brutal, fun, fast-paced third-person parkour hero shooter & platformer inspired by the classic team arena shooters of the past, mixed with modern game mechanics, featuring unique parkour movement, hero classes, vehicles, tons of guns and many game modes for unlimited hours of gameplay.\nBulletVille is currently planned for release on PC and Mac, PS5, Xbox Series X, Nintendo Switch and mobile (iOS, Android).\n\nWant to get a feel of the game? \nYou can play a teaser of the Alpha 1.0 on G.ROUND.\n\nAnd join BulletVille's 150,000+ fan base?\nHave a look at our Discord server.\n\n\n\nBulletVille borrows inspiration from many great games to create a new, unique experience.\n\n Frantic shooting gameplay from games like Quake 3 Arena\n   Diverse cast of game modes like Overwatch\n   Character progression from games like Paladins\n   Third-person high mobility from games like Warframe and Infamous 2\n   Vehicle combat from games like Borderlands 2 or Battlefield\n And much more in development to keep your eyes on!\n\nFrom bandits to robots to cats in boxing gloves, vagabonds and marauders of any shape and size are welcome on New Montana! Choose your hero, master their abilities, and blow new holes in your enemies with their unique weapons and play-styles!\n\n\u201cHand over your booze, your money, and your guns. In! That! Order!\u201d\nThe reigning king of the biggest bandit clan this side of the District. Formerly a top surgeon on Earth, Hunter Cassidy\u2019s life came crashing down around him when bandit loan sharks from New Montana killed his wife and daughter. In a drunken rage, he hijacked a shuttle, took his revenge, murdered the bandit clan\u2019s leaders, and assumed command of the whole clan as its new king - just in time to wake up with the worst hangover he ever had!\n\nHunter's Gameplay\nDue to his troubled past, Hunter has learned clever ways of getting revenge. He\u2019ll act as a comfortable place for most players to immediately pick up and play, with Recon capabilities and powerful weapons. His signature Rocket Launcher is his pride and joy, but he might break a bottle over your head instead just for fun.\n\n\u201cA dance costs extra, but I\u2019ll kill you for free.\u201d\nThe sharpest shot to ever sling suds. A troublesome teenage genius, Lacey Rose\u2019s bad attitude and cynicism turned an honest life of jumping between minimum wage jobs into a living nightmare. Her zeal for life returned when she heard of the Treasure Rush on New Montana, where she now works as a saloon dancer and moonlights as a treasure hunter, on the hunt for a fortune or an awesome death.\n\nLacey's Gameplay\nLacey brings her moves from the Saloon to the Battlefield and will dance, roll or slide her way to victory. Before the dust settles, she\u2019ll wrangle her enemies or force them to break out in a boogie before ending their misery with her trusty Shotgun.\n\n\"SOMEBODY GET GEARTOOTH A GUN TO EAT!\"\nGeartooth is the human equivalent of a cannonball-sized bullet shaped like a fist, with a heart of gold to fall back on. Once the most decorated (and most cybernetically-repaired) commando in the entire galaxy, a life without war left Geartooth with a whole in his soul. He\u2019s come to New Montana seeking the thrill of warfare, the bounty of treasure, and the constant sound of gunfire.\n\nGeartooth's Gameplay\nTrue to his backstory, the man really does eat bullets and brushes off explosives like flies. Being in the military, he\u2019s seen some tough things, but always knows how to bring up the morale of his troops. And if he ever gets lonely in the jungle, his AI turret, \u2018Milkshaker\u2019 is there to keep him company and watch his 6.\n\n\u201cWill he scratch? Will he bite? WILLY PUNCH!\u201d\nA cat in boxing gloves with an addiction to monster hunting (yes, you read that right.) Willy\u2019s existence is, in and of itself, a complete head-scratcher. Is he the last in a long line of universally renowned beast-hunting cats? Is he the end result of some mad scientist\u2019s experiments that escaped and embarked on a never-ending quest to rid the universe of monsters? Is he God itself? Nobody knows, and if you ever get close enough to ask him, he\u2019ll put out your lights before you get the chance.\n\nWilly's Gameplay\nWilly is little but he packs one hell of a punch. His weapons are his Left and his Right and he truly only wants to hurt people. Watch out for his pounce and uppercut, but you may as well call the morgue yourself if you piss him off. Sometimes he\u2019s cute and will take a nap anywhere though. Strange fella.\n\n\u201cWould you be willing to fill out a survey regarding your death?\u201d\nThe greatest mind in the universe with the heart of a child and an endless hunger to discover the meaning of life, through the study of death. Born in the heart of a dying star with no known creator, the Angel is a hyper-advanced AI entity based on New Montana for one reason: to satisfy her unexplainable fascination with life itself, by gathering test subjects for her experiments into death.\n\nAngel's Gameplay\nA flying Cyborg with precision aim and a real threat to life as we know it, Angel holds celestial power inside of her waiting to burst out. She has some extra mobility layered in to make her quite agile which helps get into great vantage points to give her Sniper Rifle a deadly angle..\n\n\u201cI was born to murder. I learned to charge for it.\u201d\nThe highest-rated, highest-priced assassin in the universe. The last surviving Mechassassin created by a pseudo-religious terrorist sect called the Order of the Dark Light, K-05 racked up over 1400 kills before they said their first word. Due to a glitch in their programming that causes them to envision the extinction of all life in the universe, K-05 currently plots to fund a campaign of omnicide by working as the galaxy\u2019s most expensive mercenary.\n\n K-05's Gameplay\nA killer that moves in silence, or can disappear in a puff of smoke, K-05 is a master of Murder. His Katana slices through enemies quickly from close, but his Sai can pin targets down at range and pull himself in to get a swift kill. The Premier Assassin in New Montana.\n\n\u201cMurderdogs! Murderdogs! Murderdogs!\u201d\nRunaway child of the universe\u2019s richest man and last of the Murderdogs. Born the last of Tarvos Wayward\u2019s daughters, Orion found an escape from her extremely sheltered and strictly-controlled life by joining the New Montana Murderdogs, a hyper-derby team known for their violence. Soon becoming their star player before she was discovered, Tarvos bought and immediately dissolved the team to spite his daughter, for which she burned down his estate and escaped into the night, vowing to take on her own father and everything with his name on it.\n\nOrion's Gameplay \nOrion has a strong penchant to burn everything!..and skate around peacefully while the fire rages. When you\u2019re on her team, she\u2019ll get you back in the fight quicker in multiple ways and when she\u2019s not burning or smoking the place out, she\u2019s picking up penalties for aggressive behaviour.\n\n\u201cToday is the greatest day since yesterday!\u201d\nThe biggest bucket of bolts that ever blew a hole in the hull of a Hypercruiser. A hobby project by an apprentice roboticist/mechanic, Trax is made of all the scrap her creator Trish \u2018liberated\u2019 from bandit vehicles, with a couple of heavy assault cannons thrown in. His personality upload was interrupted by an invasion of Trish\u2019s workshop, during which the half-baked happy-go-lucky Trax blew away the assailants. He now eagerly jumps at the chance to join in the fun with his murderous friends while Trish is away.\n\nTrax's Gameplay\nExplosive weapons for hands means some great zone control tools at Trax\u2019 disposal. Being made of car parts, Trish made sure to keep power under the hood and some Spy Gadgets just in case. If the rocket hands weren\u2019t enough, he\u2019s got a few more tucked away for the right time.\n\nGrind on rails, climb up walls, commandeer vehicles and mechs\u2014if you\u2019re standing still, you\u2019re doing it wrong! With a million ways to move around the battlefield, you\u2019re sure to find a method of murder that\u2019s right for you!\n\nSlide\nDouble Jump\nHop over rails\nRun on walls\nClimb walls\nSlide down walls\nGrind on rails\nGrapple swing\nGrapple Pull\nGlide\nHang onto ledges\nTeleport using portals\n\n\n\nNew Montana is a beautiful place to live, once you look past the constant death and destruction. Fight in the city, in the desert in the sky, or on the moon, among other scenic vistas! Don\u2019t stop to take in the landscape, or else that castle might be your crypt!\nTarvosham (Old London)\nIn its glory days, Tarvosham was the pet project of Tarvos Wayward, whose love of Victorian aesthetics inspired him to design the entire district of New Montana just a short distance from his front door. Powered entirely by steam (generated by underground nuclear power chambers), Tarvosham was strictly for people of class, sophistication, and proper dress sense. On her way out of the burning Wayward Estate, Orion personally lay waste to Tarvosham until its citizens were forced to evacuate. \n\nHigh Stratos (Sky City)\nUp where the air is clear and the hum of the neutron thrusters lulls you to sleep at night. High Stratos was originally designed to host dignitaries and officials from the Union of Galactic Species on New Montana; with features like luxury accommodation, furnished conference rooms, free WiFi, and a two thousand kilometre vertical separation from the planet\u2019s surface.\n\nOsaka-Ku (Nu Tokio)\nProof that gentrification can happen anywhere, even in space. Osaka-Ku was green-lit as part of a business deal between Tarvos Wayward and macro-industrialist Makemake Gyokai. Gyokai planned to use Osaka-Ku\u2019s economy to buy New Montana for himself, and turned it into a bustling sector for small restaurants and high-rise apartments. However, when Tarvos Wayward began the Treasure Rush and scrapped New Montana\u2019s laws, most of Osaka-Ku\u2019s citizens ditched the planet altogether. \n\nMarauder Mesa (Wild West)\nTechnically not a mesa, but bandits aren\u2019t exactly topography majors. Marauder Mesa started out as little more than a camp for the planet\u2019s first settlers. Once its treasures and history were unearthed, they established Harmony Vale with houses, a general store, and\u2014of course\u2014a brothel.\n\nThe District\nThe District is what happens when the guy who owns the planet you\u2019re building a highway on announces he\u2019s scrapping every law on the planet during your lunch break. The District was originally meant to be an interchange and layover spot along highways across New Montana. When Tarvos Wayward threw all of the already crime-riddled planet\u2019s laws into the fire, the entire construction crew abandoned the site to flee the planet before the carnage began. \n\nThe Golden Wasteland\nBecause of course a planet as worthless as New Montana is half-desert. Don\u2019t let the name fool you; the operative word here is \u2018Wasteland\u2019. You\u2019d be hard-pressed to find a tumbleweed in this arid landscape. But one thing you\u2019ll find plenty of? Bones. Just below the shifting, never-ending surface of the sand dunes is a graveyard of foolish treasure hunters, mercenaries and people who never learned how to use a map.\n\nCastle of Aarrgh (The Frozen Post)\nEither the owner of this castle died while naming it, or they were just a big Monty Python fan. Not even Tarvos Wayward can explain the existence of this random medieval castle built on a random craggy shore. (Or is it a reef? Maybe a delta\u2026?) The only logical conclusion is that some rich asshole with more time than sanity decided they wanted a castle and spent their life building it. It\u2019s a solid castle, but without a king. Or a kingdom. Or any point to its existence. \nWaypoint Station\nThere\u2019s a Waypoint Station on almost every planet in the Union of Galactic Species; a contract between them and the Wayward Group made sure of that. One of Tarvos Wayward\u2019s thousands of interstellar spaceports, New Montana\u2019s Waypoint Station is built on its moon, Helenia. With space fore even the largest commercial vessels, every Waypoint Station is complete with fuelling points, overnight rooms and a members-only commissary, as well as transports to the planet\u2019s surface. \n\nThe Scarlet Temple (Forest Temple)\nThe Scarlet Temple is a dark red stain on the Union of Galactic Species\u2019 history. Before the UGS claimed the planet that would eventually be named New Montana, it was the base of the Order of the Dark Light, a pseudo-religious fanatical sect responsible for the abduction and slaughter of millions of children across the universe. They built the temple to house laboratories, where they spliced the DNA of their victims to create the genetically-perfect Mechassassin. Only one such soldier, K-05, ever left the temple. \n\nAnam-Ka\u2019Rui (Alien Temple)\nA mysterious, unsettling structure in the heart of the Golden Wasteland. Its name is said to have been whispered by its discoverer, after he fainted upon setting foot inside. Tarvos Wayward has yet to formally acknowledge this citadel\u2019s existence, but theories as to its origin continue to pop up on conspiracy networks across the galaxy.\n\n\nKickstarter-exclusive \"Star Hunter\" skin concept - Make it yours!\n\n3D Glass Sculpture of Hunter\nNOWWA (Now, Winners Announced) is an independent studio run by Yohami Zerpa, which develops casual games for mobile platforms. In 2017, after nearly two decades of developing games for other studios, Yohami decided to go indie and create a game that mixed all his favourite influences from media and culture, ranging from victorian horror to futuristic cyberpunk, talking boxing cats and AI androids, ninjas and pirates. A few months and prototypes later BulletVille was born. Yohami is the main driving creative force, art director and manager.\nNOWWA is comprised by an all-stars team:\n\n Robert brings his AAA experience with networking, replication and server side code, and a vast knowlege of the intricacies of the Unreal Engine, supported by Mohamed \n Lewis polishes the locomotion sets and makes sure everything runs smooth and feels smooth for the players, with an obsessive eye for detail\n Phil and Nicola use their genius in marketing and social media to make sure the world knows about BulletVille\n Garrett works as game designer, level designer and keeps an eye on all tasks and brings structure into the project, with a cool head and a calm hand\n Robbin and Blaze are talented level designers that know how to adapt their creations for BulletVille's high mobility. \n Breiner, Aaron and Siavesh do the rigs and animations\n Joshua, Scott, Russ, Dragos, Alexandr bring the very diverse locations of New Montana into life with environment design and stylized textures\n Siavash is an amazing animator who brings our heroes to life! \n AkiraX3, Jesus, Mauro, Arty work on 2D design, interfaces, banners and logos\n Kyle, Joe, Kevin, Romain and Christian turn the concepts into 3D models, characters and props\n Peter, Crackers, Alexis take care of the lighting and shaders\n Stiven is a talented kid who works on UI and game modes\n Nick uses his long experience with SFX design to make our sound palette unique and distinctive\n Jask takes care of our community, especially the huge BulletVille Discord\nEmmy-winner Oscar Fogelstr\u00f6m creates our lush and rich soundtrack, with collaboration from Murray Atkinson \nMega-talented writer / voice actor Reece Bridger brings life to Trax, is writing every line of dialogue & lore and, last but not least, handles casting and management of other voice actors - our illustrious list includes Aimee Smith, Alexis Monteith, Cassie Ewulu, Daniel Dorse, Griffin Puatu, Jenna Kathleen, Lizzie Hofe, Malcolm Ray, P.M. Seymour, Terrance Drye, Thaddeus Walster, Tom Schalk and Yong Yea! \nAnd Tim watches in the back taking care of admin and finance \n\n\n\nBecause we\u2019re an independent game studio with big goals and bigger dreams.\nWe\u2019ve gotten this far bootstrapping the project as a REAL indie game, untarnished by pesky big corporations and dirty publisher tactics, and we\u2019d like to keep it that way!\nWe\u2019ve got private backing that allowed us to get this far, and enough to finish the core game.\n\nHow does this Kickstarter campaign and a backing of 100,000 USD help us? \nWell, the funding will allow us to grow our team and do QA, pay for artists and external developers to speed things up, do more skins, maps, game modes, and heroes.\nEvery dollar above our target will speed up development of the game and extend its scope even more - your pleasure!\nHere\u2019s what you can do to help!\n Like, share and retweet this video (link) recapping our kickstarter to new players!\n   Back our campaign! \nhttps://discord.gg/xP32KCRj", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWriting highly complex software such as video game code with numerous components has the implicit risk of bugs that cannot be easily identified or fixed. But our indie studio team consists of people all around the world who really know what they're doing. The accumulated experience of certainly more than 100 years in game development and the transparency we always provided on our progress with BulletVille is the insurance that you get your reward in time.\n\nWe are self-funded out of personal income and proceeds from casual games we made so BulletVille will be launched in any case, it's just a question of time and scope - your backing will allow to deliver the beta/full version earlier and with more maps, heroes, modes and skins.\n\nCovid is a risk and could slow down development but will not prevent us from delivering BulletVille and the most impacted part is the time and place of the BulletVille release party due to travel and social gathering restrictions. We will communicate according to the further developments.\n\nBy far the biggest risk, which we are also unable to mitigate completely, is\u2014Tarvos Wayward himself. \nGiven his fortunes, he may snap up all available rewards, just to show he can.

THERE'S NO MARGIN FOR ERROR. AS SCIENTISTS, WE NEED DATA TO KNOW WHAT WORKS.\nRight now, in 2021, that dataset DOES NOT EXIST. \nThe answer? A high-resolution LiDAR scan of the Earth's surface, starting with the areas most threatened. \nCourtesy of Conscious Design // Unsplash\nIT SOUNDS LIKE SCIENCE FICTION, BUT WE ALREADY HAVE THE TECHNOLOGY TO DO THIS.\nAnd, it\u2019s happened before.\nIn 2019, we watched in horror as the Notre Dame Cathedral went up in flames. The iconic spire collapsed and the roof was all but destroyed.\nMiraculously, though, art historians Andrew Tallon and Paul Blaer scanned the Cathedral using LiDAR in 2010.\nImage created by Andrew Tallon & Paul Blaer\nNow, their LiDAR scan is the most comprehensive record of the Cathedral and it\u2019ll be invaluable to the reconstruction.\n WE NEED A SCAN LIKE THAT, BUT FOR THE AMAZON \nWe\u2019ve already lost 50 percent of the world\u2019s rainforests, we\u2019re losing 18 million acres of forest each year, and rising sea levels will make whole cities, countries, and continents unrecognizable.\nUnless we have a record of these places, no one in the future will even know they existed.\nOrganizations like CyArk are doing incredible work to scan historical monuments. But nothing similar exists for the earth\u2019s landscapes \u2013 until now.\nProfile of a LiDAR point cloud from a tropical forest\n\nI\u2019m Dr. Chris Fisher, National Geographic Explorer, archaeologist, husband, and father.\nI was trained as a traditional archaeologist, using methodologies that\u2019ve been around since the 50\u2019s.\nThat all changed in July 2009 in Michoac\u00e1n, Mexico, when I stumbled across an ancient urban megalopolis \u2013 26 square kilometers \u2013 a lost city with thousands of building foundations. An archaeological site so big that it would take me decades, the entire rest of my career, to survey fully.\nInstead, my colleague Steve Leisz, suggested using a new technology, LiDAR, Light Detection And Ranging.\nLiDAR involves shooting a dense grid of infrared beams from an airplane toward the ground. What you get is a high-resolution scan of the earth\u2019s surface and everything on it. Not an image but a dense 3-D cloud of points, like this:\nPLAY\n\nIn just 45 minutes, the LIDAR scan collected the same amount of data as what would\u2019ve taken decades by hand!\nEvery house foundation, road, building, terrace, and pyramid in incredibly high resolution, representing thousands of people who were born, loved, lived, and died in these spaces. And what\u2019s more \u2013 the quality of these data was not comparable to traditional archaeological research \u2013 it was much, much better.\nI knew this technology would change the entire field of archaeology in the coming years, and it did.\nThe next time we used LiDAR in my work, it became the subject of Douglas Preston\u2019s book, The Lost City of the Monkey God.\nCourtsey of Douglas Preston\nThat book became an instant bestseller (maybe you\u2019ve read it!) but most importantly, it showed the potential of LiDAR \u2013 as a tool for archaeologists, ecologists, and geologists. But also, for conservation.\nIt made me wonder -- what if we used LiDAR to scan the entire Earth? It would be one of the greatest data sets in human history. A perfect record of our planet at one moment in time.\nThat idea became The Earth Archive, a non-profit organization & mission I launched from the TED Stage in 2019:\nTHE EARTH ARCHIVE IS AN UNPRECEDENTED SCIENTIFIC EFFORT TO LIDAR SCAN THE ENTIRE SURFACE OF THE EARTH, BEFORE ITS TOO LATE\nIts purpose is threefold:\n1) Create a baseline record of the earth as it is today to more effectively mitigate the climate crisis. The only way to measure change is to compare two sets of data \u2013 a before and an after. Right now, we don\u2019t HAVE a high-resolution \u201cbefore\u201d data set for most of the planet. So we don\u2019t know how things are changing and whether our efforts to combat climate change are making a positive impact. These data can be used by local stakeholders and indigenous groups to help solve issues of land tenure and conservation. Part of our mission is to help build grass roots capacity to store and use these data at the community level. \n2) Build a virtual planet, a digital twin, accessible to any number of scientists so we can better understand our world today. Archaeologists like me can discover undocumented settlements. Ecologists can study forest composition, tree size, age, and distribution. Earth scientists can study hydrology, geology, and ecosystems. And planners can use all this information to design sustainable conservation areas, the best places to put needed infrastructure, and resilient and sustainable communities.\n Preserve a record of the earth for our grandchildren\u2019s grandchildren so they can study & recreate our lost cultural and ecological heritage. As science & technology advance, they\u2019ll apply tools, algorithms, and AI to LiDAR records collected today, ask questions, and analyze them in ways that we can\u2019t currently conceive of. We see this as the ultimate legacy that we can leave for future generations. \nLike Notre Dame, we can\u2019t imagine how these records will be used, but we know that they\u2019ll be critically important.\nWE'RE MAKING THIS DATA AVAILABLE TO SCIENTISTS AROUND THE WORLD -- FOR FREE.\nThe Earth Archive is what scientists need to more effectively fight the climate crisis\nCourtesy of Ryk Porras // Unsplash\nWE KNOW IT WORKS BECAUSE WE\u2019VE DONE IT BEFORE\nSince founding the Earth Archive, we\u2019ve brought together a broad coalition of partners including:\nInstituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais\nInstituto Colombiano de Antropolog\u00eda e Histor\u00eda\nUniversidade de S\u00e3o Paulo\nUniversidad Tecnol\u00f3gica de Pereira\nMapBiomas \nLeaning on 30+ years of research experience in Latin America, we\u2019ve cultivated relationships with local government officials, indigenous peoples, scholars, and stakeholders who are eager to get started. We are helping to jump-start local grass roots efforts.  In other words --\nWe have the technology, our team is ready, we have permission to do the scans, and the only thing we need to scan is YOUR support.\n\nAn example of recent deforestation\nImage taken from LiDAR showing deforestation\nHERE\u2019S HOW YOU CAN HELP\nEvery $60,000 we raise covers the cost of scanning a 300 km2 region of the Amazon \u2013 that includes hiring local pilots to fly & operate the LiDAR machine, then transfer, backup, and store the data.\nThe more you fund, the more we scan!\n\u2026 and the more we understand, conserve, and preserve.\nThe more we scan, the cheaper it gets. Scanning the entire Amazon will cost roughly $20 million. We will accomplish this \u2013 it\u2019s only a matter of time.\n\nHERE\u2019S WHAT YOU\u2019LL RECEIVE\nCheck out the side panel for full details on our 10 INCREDIBLE prize backs >>>\nBut first, a preview:\nCourtesy of Chris Sarsgard // Unsplash\nJoin me on a fly-fishing day trip in my home state of Colorado, capped off with a night at one of Fort Collins\u2019 most beloved restaurants.

No one explicitly told me that to be trans was to be othered or hated or laughed at, but they didn\u2019t have to -- it was written into the media I consumed.   \nNan Goldin\nWhen I finally came out as nonbinary, I had already been dating my partner Beck, a ciswoman, for about two years -- it was as much a reckoning with her own identity as it was for mine. Based on a true experience, VALENTINE explores how shifting identities can affect a romantic relationship and test the strengths of love between two people. \nBlack Swan (2010)\nToo often do I see movies with this type of story end in total rejection of the trans character. In our film, we hope to show a more nuanced relationship in all of its complexities, one that feels authentic to our own lives.\nEuphoria (2019)\nAs a filmmaker, I am committed to creating stories that center the trans experience, so that the next generation of trans kids searching for validation and affirmation can see themselves and their stories reflected back to them onscreen. To have that in my own childhood would have been everything -- perhaps I could have spent more time just living my life, rather than imagining it.\nPhilip-Lorca diCorcia\nChris McNabb (Co-Writer/Co-Director/Editor)\nCHRIS MCNABB (they/them) is a Brooklyn-based filmmaker, two-time Emmy Award-winning editor, and Sundance Documentary Edit & Story Lab Fellow.

Also, the narrative of the story is completed. All the animations for the players, the NPCs, and objects are 90% ready. The scenes are 20 % ready. The rest of the artwork is in the process of being digitalized.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe biggest challenge of this campaign is the sound effects. Yet, I\u2019m working on it, and I rely on the technical support needed to deliver a proper result. Once the stretch goal number 3 is reached, the sound effects will be delegated to a specialist. \n\nThe risk is that I\u2019m currently looking for a job. In any case, I\u2019m very good at managing my time and I\u2019m fully committed to this campaign and to give the rewards in the stipulated times. \n\nI\u2019ll notify all the advances of the production to the supporters through the Kickstarter account,Twitter and Instagram.

It has also prevented a lot of charlie horses in my calves because I can stretch them throughout the day.\u201d - Tysons Grandma\nLUNAR is not responsible for irresponsible movement on the mat. LUNAR is not actually made of moon rock and gravity is still in play.  Tripping and stumbling on the mat is not common however LUNAR takes no responsibility for face plants caused by irresponsible day-dreamers running, jumping and playing on the mat.\n*Quick Story*\nHey Backers, It's Tyson. I've been working from a desk for the past 8 years. I've been through numerous desk setups and ergonomic options. I've tested almost every option on the market. From standing desks, ergonomic keyboards & mice, balance chairs, exercise balls, height-adjustable stands, monitor arms.. the list goes on and on.\nSometimes during the day, I\u2019d straight up fall asleep, wake up an hour later in a drool puddle on my desk. (It was the classic \"fall asleep at my desk scenario..)\nSo I started doing research on ways to \u201cstay awake\u201d.\nOne of the most common things that were coming up in my extensive google search was the term \u201cstanding desks\u201d...\nI learned they helped with productivity, and STAYING AWAKE.\nSo I ordered one immediately.\nIt arrived in a record breaking 2 days (thanks amazon).\nI earnestly put it together and started using it.\nI quickly learned within about a week of use I couldn\u2019t actually stand all day!\nMy feet would get fatigued and I\u2019d have to sit.\nThis was interesting, and so I did some more research and discovered this was a common issue.\nThe solution I found for this problem was a called an \u201canti-fatigue standing mat\u201d.\nThese have been around for decades, used in tons of commercial applications... you know the ones you see your 5th grade teacher standing on by the whiteboard? (Yeah those ones)\nSo I ordered one, and it arrived in all it\u2019s glory.\nAll it was, was a boring, flat poly mat, black, about 1in thick.\nSo I started using it, and it worked.. somewhat!\nI could stand longer, but not all day.\nI noticed my feet would still get tired.\nI noticed my feet would still get fatigued.\nI noticed I was still getting posture fatigue and my back would ache after a long 8 hour day.\nI noticed my arches hurt.\nThis sent me on a journey of thinking and designing.\nI wanted to come up with something that would allow me to move my feet while working without distracting me.\nI wanted to come up with something that would allow me to massage my arches.\nAnd that's how I came up with LUNAR.\nIt\u2019s a standing mat that isn\u2019t boring. It's a standing mat that also works for sitting. It's a standing mat that isn't flat. It's an active standing mat that helps you stay focused and get your work done.\nTyson started programming when he was 16.. so he was destined for the \"Desk Life\". The problem is Tyson cares about his body and doesn't want all the crazy side affects of the \"Desk Job\". That set him on a journey, testing every ergonomic office product available. That's what led him to create LUNAR.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nSome of the biggest risks involved with this project are getting the product to our backers on time. Depending upon backer support, manufacturing and shipping time could increase.

I'm Tanja, and I love making games. For the past 8 months I've been working on The Dream almost fulltime, alongside my studies. With yours and Kickstarter's help, The Dream can be completed and released by February of 2023.\nIt is my first project on Kickstarter and honestly, I am both excited and... yes, a bit scared. But I suppose I am not alone. I have you guys!\nThe Dream is a first-person puzzle and aventure game. It's quite simple - everything you need to do is just walk around and enjoy yourself! Both day and night. Well, day and night in the game, of course. You will encounter surprises almost every step. You will search for clues and solve puzzles. Or it may not be that simple after all...\nInitially, there will be a total of 200 puzzles in the game which can be solved in about 6-7 hours. But the more funding I receive, the more content and puzzles I can provide you. Which means more fun, of course. It's completely up to you!\nYou will also be able to walk under water and explore everything. Yes, it will be puzzles there too. Why always walk on land? It's so boring! \nSome time ago I was working as a system developer. That's when I tried to code in Unity for the first time. And I liked it more than making websites and systems for my clients! I wanted to make my own decisions about what to create. Making games gives me this posibility and I suppose that's why I like it so much. Now I am studying to be a virtual reality developer.\nI started making The Dream in my spare time and I soon noticed that I enjoy this more than my studies. Whenever I worked on this project I felt very good. I'm learning a lot in school, and although I enjoy the tasks and the process, I have to be honest with myself about what I want. Therefore, if the project is sponsored, I will focus on it full time.\n\nThe world and the environment is about 95% complete. Now I work with puzzles and I find it very engaging. My inspiration for the puzzles comes from literally everywhere. It's the most fun part of the project. Sometimes I don't even notice that the day is almost over. Puzzles are the biggest part of the project and that's exactly what I'll be doing for the next two years.\nEnjoy dynamic day and night\nEnjoy seasons and weather effects\nFeel no time pressure or stress \nGrab and move things\nDecrypt important messages\nWalk under water and explore things\nDiscover items and solve puzzles\nClick on different objects to rotate them\n  The Dream is planned to release on Steam (Windows, Linux and Mac). You guys, the ones who choose the Early Access tier, will get to play the game earlier then the others and give me your feedback. It will be so much fun!\nWell, it's only me. The strongest team in the world! I code, make 3d models and I do marketing. Believe it or not, I love all of them. Sometimes it is difficult to do it all alone, but since I am not afraid of obstacles, it makes me fearless and strong in front of other problems in my life. And I don't like to give up! It may be why I love puzzles so much. I am an introvert and although I'm quite social, I know nothing better then sitting alone in my cozy corner and working on my game.\nThe Dream is getting bigger and it's hard to focus on something else alongside it. I love this game and I am sure you will love it too so I would be happy to see it finished and see you playing it as well.\nIt would be difficult to consistently work on it, considering I'm studying full time. With enough funding, I can focus all my attention on the game instead. And one more thing. Kickstarter gives me the support of you guys - a strong community of honest people, who will not hesitate to give me the feedback I need.\nI need most of the money to pay my living costs untill I release the game. I will also promote my game. I promise you to pay my taxes. Everyone should.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nA big risk is that the project is delayed or worse, not finished. I've seen this in many other projects and therefore I did my best to give myself enough time to complete the game. But it all depends on you, because it would be difficult to drive the project forward without you supporting me.\n\nThe challenge I recognize in this project are the puzzles themselves, which are the core of the game. They have to be outstanding, otherwise the game will feel dull and uninteresting. So, I've done much research to gather the knowledge I need so that the puzzles become engaging. But I will not stop there. I realise that the game can always become better. That's why your feedback is extremely valuable to me.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Tanja Leonova\nFirst created \u00b7 0 backed\nI am a system developer and study game development, live in Sweden in a small town next to Stockholm.

Miniatures in the game will come unpainted.\nIn Tiny Epic Dungeons players control a band of Heroes exploring a treacherous dungeon in search of the fearsome Dungeon Boss.\nHeroes make their way through the dungeon one room at a time. Around every corner goblins and ferocious minions seek to block the Heroes\u2019 path.  Where there isn\u2019t an enemy, traps are set, ready to spring on even the most prepared Hero.\nTiny Epic Dungeons features a modular dungeon that is unique with each play.\nThe game is played over 2 ACTS: the Dungeon and the Dungeon Boss. In both acts the players are constantly struggling against the waning firelight of their torch which decreases each turn. When the torch goes out, the Heroes are forever lost in the darkness.\nAfter clearing the dungeon of all its minions and finding the entrance to the lair, players must engage in an epic battle against the Boss. Each boss has unique abilities and a lair with a unique environment that gives various advantages and disadvantages depending on the skill used and where the Hero attacks from.\nThese Epic Monsters cannot be slain by mere swords, axes, arrows, and the occasional spell. Ritual Rooms around the dungeon must be used to lower their magical bond to the dungeon. The Dungeon boss must be lured to these rooms to lower their defenses and allow the Heroes to strike the final blow!\nVictory in Tiny Epic Dungeons is achieved by defeating the Dungeon Boss!\nIn order to do that, the Heroes will need to collect Legendary Loot, and Supreme Spells. \nHeroes of old crafted loot to honor the ways of their clans. Bear, Lion, Phoenix, and Panther. Heroes can discover pieces from these ancient sets that grow more powerful the more you collect. \nWill you be the greatest warrior the Bear clan has ever seen? Or will you make the Panther clan proud by stalking your prey and striking with surprising force, unseen before the moment of impact.\nThe story is yours to tell in...\nWhen you pledge for a Deluxe copy of Tiny Epic Dungeons, you will receive the base game PLUS the Deluxe, Potions & Perils, components shown below.\nThis image updates with unlocked stretch goals.\nThe Potions & Perils mini expansion brings a whole new element to the game in the way of Potions and the perilous alchemists that concoct them... the Mixy Goblins!\nMixy Goblins are added directly to the goblin deck and are encountered like normal goblins. Except, they are not like normal goblins.  When you defeat a Mixy Goblin, something explodes! You'll draw a Potion Card to see what the effect is. Each Potion Card will describe a peril that occurs when you kill a Mixy Goblin and will also leave you with a handy potion for use later!\nAdditionally,  the mini expansion brings new Dungeon Bosses, Minions and Goblins to the game. Each presenting a unique challenge that will test even the best players! \n***Kickstarter-Limited Exclusivity - Deluxe content will not enter regular distribution.

We have done significant pre-production. This includes having all the illustrations for the game complete and the graphic art over 95% complete. The production quote is in hand and ready to be initiated.\n\n2. We are working with an experienced manufacturing partner. We are familiar with their production requirements, timelines, payment schedules, communication methods and Chinese freight arrangements and costs for when it comes time for shipping. We will provide tracking information for the boat when the games leave China.\n\n3. We are working with an experienced fulfillment partner. We are confident that they can handle any amount of work we send their way. They have fulfilled many projects and have proven to be communicative, punctual and respectful when dealing with our customers.\n\nAbove all, I am 100% dedicated to backer communication. I will be transparent with our process and involve our backers as much as possible. I will be present daily during the project to answer any questions and I read every comment.

Giving new readers a huge 72-page chunk of our bizarre protagonist and the threats that stand between him and his end game.\nWe are fortunate to once again be blessed with the atmospheric and powerful art of future superstar Kris Wantowhy. \nKris has worked wonders in bringing our designs and vision for this dark, yet familiar world to life. \nIf you backed our Kickstarter for issue 1 - you\u2019ll already know that Bete Noir is a twisty journey of shocks and surprises. The Djinn is gathering resources, manipulating old friends and enemies, and settling old scores.\n(Plus he has a cool Robot.)\nWhere does he get all those wonderful toys?\nIssue 1 of Bete Noir was launched on Kickstarter last year and has gone on to garner critical acclaim: \n\n\"Writer Andrew Clemson has managed to create an indie superhero book that feels different from the flood of books we already see in the mainstream ... with a far fresher feeling than I was maybe first expecting.  That\u2019s an undoubted win to begin with but that\u2019s backed up with suitably gritty & atmospheric art from Kris Wantowhy who gives the world a weight that hammers home the twists in the tale.\" - Comics Anonymous\n\n\"The story took hold of me from page one, lulled me into a sense of thinking that I understood the plot, then smacked me back into reality with twist after twist...An incredible rush of adrenaline that you never want to end..\" - Fanbase Press\n\n\"Bete Noir leaves you with a lot of questions which you will find yourself thinking about long after you\u2019ve read it.\" - Pipedream comics\n\n\"This story whirls up like an air raid siren in its pace and structure, and it's maddeningly brilliant...Superbly immersive and exciting Bete Noir is for fans of comics with a dark tone, beautiful sketch and ink art with a story meatier than a bigfoot steak. A series not to be missed.\" - Comic Book News UK\nWe've streamlined the pledge rewards for this campaign to keep things nice and simple.

In the few days since our Kickstarter campaign launched we've had potential investors come forward to fund the series.  Everyone is committed to Mike Nawrocki\u2019s vision and agrees he should retain creative control over the series\u2019 content \u2014 which was our main reason for choosing Kickstarter vs. traditional investor funding.  As a result, we are suspending this Kickstarter campaign and hope to have more great news to share with you soon.\nFor all the latest updates and exclusive clips, please join our mailing list at www.deadseasquirrels.com.  And for more information on potential investment opportunities and/or for general questions, please email us at info@deadseasquirrels.com.\n\nTHE STORY:\nIt's a squirrelly age we're living in... and we need new heroes. THE DEAD SEA SQUIRRELS tells the story of Merle and Pearl, two 1st century squirrels from Israel who\u2019ve been preserved in sea salt in a cave alongside the Dead Sea. When 10-year-old Michael discovers them 2000 years later and sneaks them home in his backpack, hijinks ensue after this salty couple reanimate and take their new friend on adventures full of action, humor, music, and character-building lessons. \n I'm Steve Taylor, and as producer of The Dead Sea Squirrels I've convinced my longtime friend Mike Nawrocki that Kickstarter is the best way to fund it. Why? Because it's way more fun building a community on Kickstarter than pitching the concept to soulless entertainment conglomerates who would then become Mike's boss. And besides boatloads of money, what have they got that we don't? So put your paws together and let's bring The Dead to life!\nHere's Mike to tell us more... \nWhen I co-created VeggieTales with Phil Vischer in 1993, I never imagined the impact our stories and characters would still be having three decades later. From Silly Songs with Larry and 3-2-1 Penguins! to our theatrical movies Jonah and The Pirates Who Don\u2019t Do Anything, it\u2019s been quite a ride. But I\u2019ve always dreamed of launching another series that taught biblical values in an entertaining way\u2026 and maybe this time featuring characters with actual arms and legs and\u2026 paws?\nEnter The Dead Sea Squirrels, my new book series that launched in 2019. The response has been incredible, with Book One now in its third printing. I knew all along I wanted the stories in these books to come alive through animation, and to create another resource for parents to get their kids excited about the Bible.\n But animation is expensive, and (despite what the internet says about my very inflated net worth) I don\u2019t have anywhere near the financial resources to fund a new series myself. In fact, I\u2019m currently making a living as a professor at Lipscomb University in Nashville, Tennessee \u2014 where I teach film and animation in our excellent School of Theatre and Cinematic Arts. What to do?\nMy colleague Steve Taylor \u2014 who continues to make music and films while overseeing our school \u2014 had an idea. What if our animation program, founded by renowned Disney animator Tom Bancroft, created the series with us? Tom and his faculty of professional animators could work alongside our top students (who we would pay to work while they're still in school), and the combination would create world-class animation.\nTom Bancroft with students in Lipscomb's Animation lab\nLipscomb Animation major Zoe Fitzhugh on the job.\n Then we could partner with our friends at Mukpuddy Studios in New Zealand to beautifully craft much of the final animation. \nAnd as a bonus, each episode would feature an original song \u2014 assuming you like all those Silly Songs I\u2019ve written through the years \u2014 like this one I wrote with Steve... \nPLAY\n\nHow do we know this will work? Because we\u2019re weeks away from finishing the pilot episode. It was funded by some generous donors who asked, \u201cCan you pull this off?\u201d\nYes we can.\nWanna make history as a Founding Backer who brought The Dead Sea Squirrels to life?\nEven better, wanna see what it\u2019s gonna look like? \nPLAY\n\nPLAY\n\nBut wait! There's more! While the majority of your donation goes to producing the series, we've lovingly crafted these soon-to-be-priceless collectibles as a thank you for your generosity, including...\nTo commemorate your role in bringing \"The Dead\" to life, we'll personalize this official certificate with your name or the name of a loved one and email it to you as a .pdf file. And unlike a college diploma, this one comes with minimal debt.\nBecause stickers go with everything: laptops, mirrors, sleeping foreheads..\n\n When worn in public, this functions as: 1) a secret handshake between backers (without the need for a post-shake hand sanitizer); or 2) a conversation starter that typically begins with, \"Why is there a dead squirrel on your lapel?\"\nThe traditional \"Dead Sea Squirrels\" design features our ready-for-adventure cast of characters posed deep inside a mysterious cave. \nThe less traditional \"We're Not Dead Yet!\" design \u2014 available in black and pink \u2014 is sure to turn heads and prompt questions like, \"Are those squirrel skeletons on your shirt?\" and \"Why are there squirrel skeletons on your shirt?\"\nAll shirts available in Youth sizes XS, S, M  & L and Adult sizes S, M, L, XL & 2XL\n We've assembled the first six books of the series into a boxed set that is being offered exclusively to our backers and will be lovingly signed by author Mike Nawrocki. And as a special bonus, we're including the time to read them.\nWe've hired Master Plush-maker Gregory Autore to design life-sized (10\") Merle and Pearl plushies so adorable that you may want to get them insured. (Merle shown above. Pearl is still being lovingly crafted.)\n\n Because if you pledge for the Complete Squirrel Works package, wouldn't you feel cheated if it didn't arrive in its own nut case?\n\n Are these premium perks more expensive? They sure are! But if you've squirrelled away a few extra (metaphorical) nuts this season, you could do worse than use them to teach and delight children.\nHigh quality animation is expensive, and depending on the studio and the content it can cost from $10,000/minute to over $1mil/minute. With the help of our faculty, students, and our partners at Mukpuddy Animation Studio, we've reduced those costs to make our series more affordable. But we need your help to make it happen!\nOur goal for the first 6 episodes (approx. 22 minutes each) is $1.2 million. \nPLAY\n\nAnd what if we exceed our goal? Do we dare dream even bigger?  Of course we do! We\u2019ve got a total of thirteen episodes planned (Mike is currently writing Book #10), so if we hit the \"stretch goal\" of $2.88mil, we can fund an entire thirteen episode series!\n And here\u2019s a sneak peak at the stories for the first six episodes: \n And now for your Soon To Be Frequently Asked Questions:\n What if you exceed your goal? We make more episodes! We\u2019ve got a total of thirteen episodes planned (I\u2019m currently writing Book #10). If we hit the goal of $2.88mil, we could fund an entire thirteen episode series!\n Let\u2019s get crazy and think even bigger: what if this campaign succeeds beyond your wildest dreams? We like the way you\u2019re thinking! More money allows us to up the quality even further on each episode, and adding to the workforce allows us to speed up our timeline.\n Speaking of timeline\u2026 what\u2019s the timeline? Once we reach our goal we\u2019ll immediately begin work on Episode Two. The plan is to produce a new episode every sixteen weeks, with the first six episode series ready to launch in Fall 2022. But if our campaign blows up and we\u2019re able to fund the entire thirteen episode series and beyond, we can use the additional funds to expand our team and speed up the timeline.\n Don\u2019t you want the series to be seen by as many people as possible? Yes we do, which is why we hope to land The Dead Sea Squirrels on a streaming platform or network to introduce it to the widest possible audience. But as beloved backers who are \u201cbringing The Dead to life,\u201d you\u2019ll be the first to see the pilot episode, along with other sneak peeks and exclusive content for our backers. \n Isn't it true that most networks and streaming platforms want to own what they present? Yes it is, and when a network puts up the money to have a series made, they ultimately have control over its content and messages. We\u2019re hoping to negotiate licenses to other broadcast and streaming platforms, but the main reason for funding the series through Kickstarter is that it will allow us creative control over these stories so we don\u2019t compromise on quality or biblical content.\n As a backer, when will I get to see the episodes? We\u2019ll send you a secret link to the pilot episode as soon as it\u2019s finished in April of this year. But we don\u2019t want to release individual episodes until the series is finished and ready to premier on a streaming platform (i.e. Amazon, Netflix, YouTube, etc.).\n What if I don't have access to that particular streaming platform? Great question... and we don't know the answer. For those who can't access the series, we'll do our best to negotiate with our distribution partner for some sort of \"backers only\" access portal (for the $25 and up level). Or maybe there's a DVD release in our future (since evidently that's still a thing). But since we don't know who our distribution partner will be at this point, we can only guarantee that you'll have access to the pilot.\n Tell me more about your partners. What is Lipscomb University? We\u2019re a Christian university here in Nashville, Tennessee, and our College of Entertainment and the Arts is rare within Christian higher education as it is situated in the heart of one of the top creative capitals in America, with access to some of the best entertainment industry veterans. Let us name-drop a little: our School of Music is directed by Grammy Award-winning producer Brown Bannister, our Animation program's founder is Disney animator Tom Bancroft, Steve Taylor leads our School of Theatre and Cinematic Arts, and our faculty is full of top practitioners in their field. (We\u2019re so connected that Steve Martin even gave our theatrical performance of his musical Bright Star a shout-out.) Here's a testimonial from storyboard artist Naomi Bethel, who was one of the first to graduate from our Animation program...\n\u201cI had a blast working on the storyboarding team.

The Things-Could-Be-Worse Travel Mug celebrates those long-gone days with a fine porcelain mug proportioned to fit in a cup holder.\nHere are the five qualities I cherish in a travel mug.\n1. Fits in my cup holder and holds up to 16 ounces of my favorite beverage.\n2. Has a tight-fitting, anti-slosh lid with a sliding cover I can open and close with one finger.\n3. Made of porcelain so it\u2019s food safe and easy to clean, even in the dishwasher.\n4. Has a handle.\n5. Decorated with reminders that my tedious and inconvenient journey could be even worse. Specific travel companions include pterodactyls, Sasquatch, giant frog, dubious musician, walking fish, robots, grim reaper, quadrupeds, pirates, UFOs, voracious sea monsters, zombie poodle, assorted dinosaurs, and other menaces.\nTapered profile means a snug fit in most cup holders.\nIf you are already familiar with the Classic and Big Things-Could-Be-Worse mugs (two of my previous Kickstarter projects), here's a drawing to help you understand the shape of this new travel mug.\nSome tedious technical considerations\n* Porcelain, so no metal or plastic flavors imparted to your beverage.\n* Food safe, microwave safe, and dishwasher safe. (Do not microwave the lid or abuse it in your dishwasher.)\n* Carry the mug upright. The lid fits tight with a silicone seal and will prevent most irksome sloshes. But lid isn\u2019t fully watertight. So you cannot just toss a full mug into your backpack without dire consequences. \n* Decoration can\u2019t wear off. In-glaze decoration means the images are melted into the surface like the porcelains you see in museums (if museums ever open again).\n* Mug will probably break when your chauffeur drops it on the driveway or garage floor.\n* Not insulated. But thick walls hold heat longer if you pre-heat them by filling with hot water for a minute before dumping and then filling with hot coffee or tea. If your beverage gets cold during the journey, consider moving closer to your workplace.\n* Most of our Calamityware porcelain is made in Poland, but these travel mugs are going to be produced in a workshop in China. The Chinese wizards have been producing porcelain for 3,000 years and do a great job maintaining precise dimension, such as when a lid needs to fit correctly.\nThe lid slides open and closed with the lightest touch of your finger. Or you can have your personal assistant make lid adjustments for you.\n\nWhat the critics are saying.\n\u201cCritters make excellent traveling companions!\u201d\n\u201cI plan to use mine at home on the couch. Lid keeps my coffee warm and reduces troublesome spills.\u201d\n\u201cAdds a touch of class to the succession of indignities that is my commute.\u201d\n\u201cCapybara, anyone?\u201d\n\u201cAlso works for milkshakes. I\u2019m just saying.\u201d\nNeed extras? Travel Mugs make great gifts for people with challenging commutes or for someone you wish would hit the road.\nTravel mug doesn\u2019t spontaneously rotate. This image is pure special effects, to allow you to see all the silly graphics. You\u2019re welcome.\nWhen can I expect these rewards? Assuming nothing calamitous happens, you should be traveling with oddities by June 2021. Probably sooner. \n\n********\nShipping. The cost of shipping will be added to your pledge based on where you live. Because these mugs are heavy, shipping costs are astonishingly high. But acquiring distinctive porcelain that could be treasured for generations might be something that you can justify.\nJust the local neighborhood. Because shipping is restricted during the Covid-19 pandemic, we are limiting rewards to residents of the U.S. and Canada only. Later, when global trade is restored, some extras of these mugs will be available at our online store. So, anyone excluded from the Kickstarter project will be able to get Travel Mugs there.\nCustoms. Sometimes, but not always, shipments to Canada get hit with customs duties. I have no way of predicting if they\u2019ll apply to your shipment. Customs inspections are very arbitrary and willy-nilly. Most packages sail through without any duty, but some are selected seemingly by chance and the recipient gets hit with a duty fee. So if you can\u2019t tolerate the risk that your shipment might get selected for extra costs, you should probably not support this project. Or arrange to have your reward shipped to a friend in the U.S. who can bring you Travel Mugs during their next trip.\nTracking number. You will receive a tracking number when we ship, so track your package daily to make sure it doesn\u2019t get hung up in the system and returned to us. Don\u2019t just assume it will show up at your door. Shipments have a way of getting stalled, and monitoring the status of the tracking number allows you to intervene promptly.\nWhere are you? When the rewards are ready to ship, we\u2019ll send out a Kickstarter address survey. If you don\u2019t respond to that survey within 6 months, we\u2019ll assume you no longer want your reward. I don\u2019t have the space to hold your reward in perpetuity or until the cows come home.\nFulfillment is provided by our capable and multi-talented partners at Fulfillrite. Our Fulfillrite friends are fast and they do things right the first time.\nWhat\u2019s going on? Sponsors of this project will receive periodic updates through Kickstarter as the project unfolds but not so often that you think I\u2019m a pest.\nQuestions? Send me your questions and I\u2019ll add them and the answers to the FAQ section at the bottom of this page.\nLeftovers from my previous Kickstarter projects are available while supplies last at www.calamityware.com. A good place to find some unusual gifts.\n\nSign up for our newsletter here so you\u2019ll never miss a thing at Calamityware.\n\nDon Moyer, Pittsburgh, February 15, 2021", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nCountless things could go wrong to delay this project. But the design is done and the pre-production proofs have been approved. So if I get enough sponsors for a production run, I can green-light production right away. I\u2019m using a proven workshop that has been doing ceramics for decades. So technical problems are unlikely. The biggest risk is that delivery will take longer than anticipated because fewer ships are puttering around during the pandemic.\n\nI promise that I won\u2019t stop working until all my sponsors receive their Travel Mugs. My gloomiest prediction is that we will ship by June 2021. I will try to make it sooner.

a handful of scenes from this 2013 graphic novel were later developed into \"world of tomorrow\", including the story of david in the museum's stasis tube. this is a borderless print that measures 8.5x11\" on archival paper and will be signed in white ink: \nNEW REWARD:  dubious original post-it note drawings! i'm going to draw you a picture! i have no idea what it's going to be! seriously it might be garfield eating lasagna. i promise it's not going to be worth anything if you try to sell it in 50 years. it's going to be in pencil on a post-it note. yours might look something like this but who even knows \nyou don't want this\nno but maybe you should pick a different reward\nNEW REWARD: \"it's such a beautiful day\" signed print of bill, \"broken\" in his hospital bed, in a limited edition of 200. this shot was originally captured in-camera, by photographing the artwork with a shard of broken glass beneath the lens. 8.5x11\" on archival paper.\nNEW REWARD: a limited edition signed print of bill under the \"amazing\" stars, from \"it's such a beautiful day\", in a limited edition of 200. \n\noriginal \"it's such a beautiful day\" production art! ...wait, what??!\n\"it's such a beautiful day\" was shot entirely on an old 35mm animation camera. that means all the live-action looking shots in the movie were actually giant piles of sequential photo prints that were photographed one frame at a time under the camera, just like the character animation.\nfor a handful of scenes, the character animation was turned into large prints too: for these shots, my original drawings were scanned and composited in photoshop to add certain special effects, and then printed back out for photography.\nfor the first time ever, we're letting go of a small number of these composited prints, from the \"beings of light\" and the \"works of art\" scenes near the end of the movie. owning the actual physical piece that was photographed for the film, you could pause \"it's such a beautiful day\" at the right spot and point to the frame hanging on your wall, groaning in recognition.\nNEW REWARD: prints from the \"fireball\" sequence are also now available. as bill walks across the red earth, it is enveloped by the flaming sun, leaving him floating in space:\nsamples from the \"fireball\" sequence of production prints\neach production print will come with a signed note, stating, this production print was used in the final photography of \"it's such a beautiful day\", so everyone will believe you.  \n\"beings of light\" production print sample\n\"works of art\" production print sample\nplease note, because these were the prints that were used in the movie's final photography, they are probably going to have camera notes scribbled in the margins, possibly mysterious phone numbers that you should not call, a slightly bent corner or two, or smudgy fingermarks. we promise to send out only the most interesting-looking ones that are in the best shape, just please don't expect them to look brand new. all of the production prints measure 8.5x11\" and are all one-of-a-kind.\n\nNEW REWARD: the original animation photo prints that were used in the final photography of \"it's such a beautiful day\". as explained above, many shots in \"it's such a beautiful day\" were created by shooting stacks of sequential still photographs  under the animation camera, often compositing the images together through multiple exposures or other kinds of trick photography. other times, these \"animated photos\" took center stage, like in this scene:\nas seen on TV\nyou'll receive three original still photos that were used in the creation of the final animated film, along with a signed card certifying that they're the genuine props. we'll make sure to only select the most interesting images for you, like these samples:\nthe still photos you receive may vary in size but are all in the 4x5\" and 5x7\" range. the reverse sides have been electronically printed and dated by the original photo lab; depending on the scene, they mostly range in age from 2006-2009.\n\nBUT WHAT ELSE?\nadditional rewards will be added as needed!\nwe'll also be sending out bonus rewards and surprises to a large number of randomly selected backers. i'm sorry but i will know where you live and there's really nothing you can do about it. \n\n\nWHEN WILL EVERYTHING SHIP TO ME?\nwe're expecting everything to start shipping around june. we'll keep you posted through kickstarter as things progress -- to be safe, make sure we have your correct address on file as soon as possible.\nALSO: if you order a print of any kind, please note that most of those will ship separately, immediately after the kickstarter campaign ends. so expect prints to arrive very soon!\n\nI HAVE MORE QUESTIONS BUT THEY ARE LESS IMPORTANT SO I WILL WRITE THEM SMALLER HERE NOW\nIS THIS A PRE-ORDER?\nno, like before, if the blu doesn't reach the minimum fundraising goal we'd prefer to skip it. a helpful part of this for us has been to gauge the world's continued interest in physical media, if any, from a safe distance\n\nI'D LIKE TO RECEIVE MORE THAN ONE OF THESE REWARDS BUT I DON'T WANT THE \"EVERYTHING\" PACKAGE. HOW DO?\nif you'd like to pledge at more than one level, kickstarter recommends pledging from a second or third account\n\nCAN I RECEIVE MORE THAN ONE COPY OF THE NEW BLU-RAY, FOR FRIENDS?\nyes,  please add $22 to your pledge total for each additional copy you'd like (up to 5), and be sure to make a note of it for us, explaining what the extra money is for, on your end-of-project survey so we don't miss it\n\nWILL THE NEW BLU-RAY BE REGION-FREE?\nyes\n\nWILL THERE BE A STANDARD-DEF DVD MADE AVAILABLE OF THIS RELEASE?\ni'm afraid not, these shorts just don't look right when downgraded to standard definition. here's a screenshot of \"world of tomorrow\" in standard-def:\nWILL THERE BE SUBTITLES AVAILABLE ON THE DISC IN EVERY LANGUAGE?\nright now we can only confirm english closed-captions for the hard of hearing\n\nPHYSICAL MEDIA IS DEAD, WHERE CAN I STREAM THIS STUFF?\nrenting or buying the titles from vimeo is still really supportive, thanks:\nhttps://vimeo.com/ondemand/worldoftomorrow\nhttps://vimeo.com/ondemand/worldoftomorrow2\nhttps://vimeo.com/ondemand/worldoftomorrow3\n\nIT SURE IS NICE AND QUIET NOW IN THIS SMALLER FONT\nyes, yes it is\nWE'RE ALONE NOW, IT'S JUST YOU AND ME\nyes hi\nJUST YOU AND ME\nuh huh\nHERE WE ARE, JUST TWO DUDES HAVING A TALK\nyep\nTWO COOL DUDES JUST HAVING A CHITTY CHAT TYPE TYPE\nhmm\nTYPE TYPE TYPE HA HA HA\nwell i think maybe we've just about covered everything\nDID YOU KNOW I HAVE A DUNGEON\nyes actually we talked about that last time\nWE PLAY LITTLE GAME FOR LONG TIME NOW\nit really does seem like forever\nLOOK I MADE A PUPPET OF YOU.

Simply pick a theme, start drawing, and Dungeon Alchemist creates high-quality maps you can print, share, or use in your favourite Virtual Tabletop Application.\nDungeon Alchemist is a standalone software app for Windows, Mac (including ARM) and Linux, which will be distributed through the Steam platform. We plan to release Dungeon Alchemist near the end of 2021, but the exact timeline depends on how much money is pledged in this campaign. If you choose to opt for an Adventurer (\u20ac45) or higher pledge, you'll get access to the beta program a few months before release.\nWe will unveil new features as we progress further in the campaign. If we surpass our funding goal, we will add even more content and features to Dungeon Alchemist for everyone to enjoy! Check out the stretch goals below.  \nDungeon Alchemist was created by Wim De Hert and Karel Crombecq, both longtime roleplayers. This project came from a personal need for an easy-to-use, convenient tool for making dungeon maps. Both working a fulltime job, we just don\u2019t have the time to design each map in excruciating detail, but we still want cool-looking tailor-made encounters for our campaigns. That\u2019s why we believe Dungeon Alchemist can really make a difference, and we are incredibly passionate about making it.\nWe would love to make Dungeon Alchemist available to everyone at a low price and with amazing content from the start. But the reality is that we have bills to pay, and to make this project as good as we want it to be, we need money to fund development. We truly believe it has the potential to be a game-changer, and we created this Kickstarter because we simply cannot build it without your help.\nWim De Hert is owner and founder of BlueJay Design Consultancy, and has over 20 years of experience in illustration and graphic design. While being an avid Pathfinder and Dungeon&Dragons player for as long as he can remember, creating Dungeon Alchemist has been an ambition ever since getting a fantasy game at the age of 7. Wim will be working on Dungeon Alchemist\u2019s lead visuals, concept design and modelling.\nKarel is an experienced game developer and senior graphics programmer. Karel has been in the game industry for over 10 years and has released games on mobile platforms and consoles. Before that, he earned a PhD at the University of Antwerp on machine learning and computer simulation. With a passion for video games and RPG\u2019s in particular and lots of experience programming games and AI algorithms, Karel is the perfect person to tackle this job! \nWe are a two-man team and we do everything ourselves. This means that we can use all the help we can get to spread the love! The more money we collect in this Kickstarter, the more time we can spend on developing Dungeon Alchemist and adding cool new features, and the quicker our app will be finished. Everybody wins!\nIf you want to help us fulfil our dream, you can do so in several ways:\nJoin our Discord Server and engage with the community.\nTell everyone about us on Facebook.\nFollow, retweet and engage with Dungeon Alchemist on Twitter.\nTalk about us on your favourite subreddit:  /r/battlemaps, /r/dnd, /r/dndmaps, /r/Pathfinder_RPG, /r/Roll20, /r/FoundryVTT,  /r/FantasyGrounds, ...\nThis campaign is promoted by Backercamp.

After two successful Kickstarter campaigns and thousands of satisfied customers, we\u2019re back with a customer-requested follow-up for sustainable pants that do it all.\nEcoTrek Trail Pants are fully-synthetic tech pants made with 70% recycled ocean waste and a modern, tailored fit. They\u2019re so versatile you can replace jeans, slacks, and outdoor pants with one pair of EcoTreks without compromising on style, functionality, or comfort.\nPlus, the lifetime warranty ensures they withstand all your adventures or you get a new pair or at-cost repair.\nWith 3 colors to choose from - Olive, Charcoal, and Caramel - there's an option for everyone.\nAt LIVSN, our mission is to empower you to own less and live more. We want you to experience all this world has to offer\u2014while respecting nature. As our company has grown, so has our sustainability initiative.\nWe\u2019ve successfully launched 2 pairs of technical pants on Kickstarter and we\u2019re back with our most innovative and sustainable pants yet.\nOur customers asked for fully synthetic pants that can go on extended hikes in both wet and cold conditions - so we got to work!\nAfter a long search, we found a material that can withstand the elements, keep you comfortable, and look amazing while carrying all the technical features you need. EcoTrek Trail Pants are made from Blue Ocean Nylon, a durable fabric that\u2019s lightweight and breathable, and withstands cold, hot, and wet conditions.\n\nOur EcoTrek Trail Pants are even more comfortable and versatile than our previous line of pants and we\u2019ve sent them to REAL people to prove it:\nBlue Ocean Nylon is a synthetic, nylon thread that\u2019s made from 70% ocean waste (specifically old buoys). The used or discarded buoys are recycled locally in Taiwan, which reduces the carbon footprint in the transportation of raw material. Plus, it\u2019s applying for the Global Recycled Standard certificate!\nThe material that makes our pants sustainable is also what makes them so exceptional.\nYour pants aren\u2019t just sustainable and built to last, they\u2019re backed by our Fair Deal Guarantee. We keep all LIVSN pants out of the landfill with our courteous warranty and replacement programs.\nTHE FIT\nEcoTrek Trail Pants fit well on most body types. They\u2019re tailored slim, but definitely not like Portland skinny jeans. They fit well on an athletic build and scale appropriately as the sizing grows, giving room for bigger builds. Sizes top out at 38x34 in waist/inseam. We also designed the roll-up system to be hemmable without any loss of function.\nTHE FUNCTION\nYour favorite technical features like roll-up cuffs, zippered pockets, water/stain resistance, quick-drying, and breathability are all incorporated into what looks like your most stylish pair of slacks. These pants aren\u2019t baggy or pocket heavy\u2014they\u2019re ridiculously stylish technical pants with higher abrasion resistance and less odor accumulation than comparable polyester fabrics.\nEcoTreks have strong reinforcements at all common failure points. The back pockets, front pockets, seams, and hardware are all reinforced to last as long as possible. Use and abuse them\u2014they can take it.\n\n\n EcoTrek Trail Pants are as comfortable as your favorite pair of sweats. The lightweight, breathable material makes them pleasant in even the hottest conditions and the relaxed fit makes them comfortable to wear with long underwear in the winter.\nYou never know what you\u2019ll face when you\u2019re hiking or camping out, and that\u2019s why it\u2019s important to have protective pants that can withstand the elements. Rain, snow, rocks, and dust\u2014EcoTreks can handle it all while giving you convenient technical features.\nOur top customers are climbers for a reason\u2014we design climbing pants that, well, look way better than climbing pants.\nYou\u2019ll love EcoTreks for travel because of their low maintenance and high-end comfort.\nUltimate comfort when you\u2019re in the car for days or on a plane for hours\nLow maintenance means you can wash them in the sink\nLightweight & versatile means you have more room for souvenirs in your luggage\n \nNo need for suffocating lycra in yet another pair of skin-tight cycling pants. Slip into EcoTreks for your daily commute or long-distance trek. The roll-up cuff system with 3M reflective tape keeps your pant legs out of your chain, and the gusseted crotch and articulated knee design ensure there are no rips, discomfort, or unflattering stretched out knees.\nWith abrasion resistance, an EDC pocket, and a zippered phone pocket-EcoTreks make a perfect pair of fishing pants. Hop into a boat or put your waders on over them, you\u2019ll look good, feel good, and have easy access to all your essentials.\nEcoTrek Trail Pants pair perfectly with a button-down for a night on the town, dinner date, or coffee shop meeting.\nIf business casual is your attire, EcoTreks will be your new favorite work pants. No one will look twice when you saunter into work wearing your favorite weekend adventure pants.\nOur mission is to build durable and versatile outdoor clothing that encourages people to wear it more, keep it longer, and spend more time outdoors.\nWith 83% of clothing ending up in landfills or incinerators, we're not out to make products \"just because\u201d or add to the clutter of apparel waste. Instead, we make long-lasting clothing that can be worn in multiple use-cases while utilizing environmentally-friendly materials!\nWhen you buy LIVSN products, you can feel good about where you\u2019re spending your money and what you\u2019re putting on your body\u2014and that\u2019s never been more true than with our EcoTrek Trail Pants.\nBelow are reviews from previous backers and verified buyers on our website.\nWe will have stock for exchanges if you need to order a different size after delivery.\nNew to Kickstarter? No problem. Follow these simple steps to get your own EcoTrek Trail Pants.\nAt the end of the campaign, we\u2019ll send you a survey to get your color, size, and shipping information, and deliver your EcoTrek Trail Pants when manufacturing is complete! We\u2019ve delivered on all our previous products and communicate to you every step of the way!\nYou can feel comfortable knowing we are backed by Techstars, \"the worldwide network that helps entrepreneurs succeed.\" Our experience going through the Austin '19 accelerator program gives us the tools and guidance we need to be a strong company for years to come.\nThe name LIVSN comes from the Swedish word \"livsnjutare,\" which roughly translates to \"one who lives life deeply; an enjoyer of life.\" This journey started with a mission to simplify our belongings. With less to manage there's more time in the day, and with more time comes flexibility. We know we won't regret more time outside with friends and family.\nWe believe clothing should perform well, look good, be ethically made, be environmentally friendly - and it should last. We want to own fewer, well-built things, and repair them before replacing them.\nWe make good clothing, we make it with tried and true methods, and we make it with high-quality fabrics.\nDURABILITY & REPAIRABILITY\nOne of our main beliefs at LIVSN is that a product that performs well and stands up to extended use is as sustainable as it gets. By buying once and with intention, we're able to consume less. We're designing our products so that when life happens and they inevitably fail, they can be repaired.\nSTYLE AND DYNAMIC USE\nOur way of approaching sustainable style is to use classic silhouettes, refined and tested materials, and clean, modern fits. We want you as the wearer to feel special, but not to call attention to it. What we want is for you to be able to wear LIVSN clothing to the trail, to the pub, or to the (casual) office and not look out of place. When we use technical fabrics and construction, we work to hide those details in a casual look.\nFABRIC SELECTION\nWe choose our fabrics because they were the best available for the job, trying to source organic and recycled when we can. Some pieces here don't utilize recycled or organic materials because we aren't able to hit the scale needed, but we promise we will switch to recycled and organic as soon as we're able.\nTHE END RESULT\nWe hope to come out in the end with something unique, but also familiar. A refined collection dedicated to the highest standards of craftsmanship and mindfulness. We hope you share our values and will help us in our journey to keep what matters.\nAndrew Gibbs-Dabney is the founder and CEO of LIVSN Designs, an outdoor brand focused on making versatile apparel designed to last longer.

Thanks to your overwhelming generosity,  Pine is funded and we met a few stretch goals, ensuring we'll be able to give this story the treatment it deserves! \nThe last 30 days have been amazing. So much so we ran out of superlatives a while ago! Tom and I are truly grateful to be backed by all of you.\nThank you again,\nTom & Najati\nPine is a story-driven game about loss and letting go, told from the perspective of a grieving woodworker. A blend of illustration, animation, music, and sound, Pine tells its story wordlessly through interactions that pull you into the woodworker's experience as he struggles to hold on to his past. \nThe woodworker came to illustrator Tom Booth in a moment of deep isolation following a tragic loss. Initially wary of sharing such a personal work, Tom was overwhelmed by the outpouring of support from friends and fans after he posted the first image of the woodworker. Their own stories of loss let Tom know that he wasn't alone in grieving.\nWe created this campaign so we could tell the woodworker's story with the hope that it can be a reminder to anyone dealing with their own grief that they are not alone.\nPLAY\n\nWe come to Kickstarter to ask for your help in creating something truly meaningful and heartfelt. Thanks to your support, we get to tell the woodworker's story! Help us spread the word so we can make Pine even better by meeting some of our stretch goals! Thank you to all our backers that got us here, and thank you to everyone stopping by for getting us even further!\n\nNot quite a video game and not quite a graphic novel, Pine blends mediums to pull you into the woodworker's world.\nInteractive moments let you share the woodworker's struggles, turning Pine's animated scenes into personal experiences. \nThe sounds of the world and an original score will combine with Pine's visual and interactive moments to bring you deeper into the woodworker's journey. \nNorthwest Soundscapes (Skywalker Sound, Sucker Punch Productions) is helping with sound design, and the score will be written alongside the game. \nHere's a list of the updates that can't be reflected in the reward descriptions, as they get locked after someone chooses them.\nBecause you all met the early funding challenge, all backers will get the bonus landscape of the woodworker's valley as a high-res wallpaper for desktop and mobile!\nEveryone who was part of the first 80k will get the exclusive soundscape, too.\nThere will be a total of seven prints to choose from: five of Tom's classic illustrations of the woodworker and two new images exclusive to the Kickstarter. Check out Update #4 to see the five that have been revealed!\nThere are add-ons for print bundles, carving mini figures, and the STL of the woodworkers.\nSee the designs for the carving mini figures in Update #7.\nCheck out past updates to see what's been going on with the campaign. Help us make Pine even better by spreading the word and sharing Pine with friends and fans of graphic novels and games!\nTom drew the first illustration of the woodworker over a long night late in the winter of 2019. It was the most personal thing he'd ever drawn, and Tom almost didn't share the image. \nOriginal sketch of woodworker. February 2019\nWhen he did, the response was overwhelming. Despite being born from an extremely personal experience, the woodworker resonated deeply with Tom's audience.\nThere was an outpouring of support from his fans, many of them thanking him for sharing the image. Some were so inspired that they created truly spectacular 3D models, fan drawings, and actual wood carvings\u2014a few even got tattoos!  \nAs Tom posted more images, the woodworker found his way around the internet. From the front page of Reddit to My Modern Met, everywhere the woodworker went, people wanted to know more about him. It was clear that Tom had found a story that needed to be told.\nIn the spring of 2019 we started brainstorming how to tell this story in a special way. Inspired by titles like Florence and, later, If Found..., we thought a story-driven game would be perfect for Pine.  \nSample of thumbnail storyboards.\nSince then we've fleshed out the rest of the story, storyboarded it, built a few prototypes, worked up enough courage to quit our day jobs, founded a company, and made a lovely version of FreeCell to get some practice publishing mobile games. It's been a busy couple of years!\nPrototyping one of Pine's interactive scenes\nEven with all that done, the work is really just beginning. We think there's a little over a year of work left on Pine, full of drawing, animating, programming, composing music, putting it all together, and testing.\nThat's what the funding from this campaign will allow us to do.\n\nAt our lowest funding goal, Pine will be released on iOS and Android. Release on Steam and Switch are stretch goals. All backers that pledge $5 or more will be able to play Pine on the platform of their choice.\nWe don't want to be presumptuous about how this campaign will go, but we do want to make sure that whatever we raise past our goal will go towards making Pine even better. For more info on the project budget, see the section after the rewards.\n* See the note in \"Risks and challenges\" below about publishing to the Switch.\nWe hope the rewards convey how much your support means to us. Every pledge receives our deepest appreciation and we tried to make each reward a meaningful new way to experience Pine. \nLook below the reward tree for details on the limited rewards.\nThe Backer Forest is our way to say a special thank you to those who play a big role in bringing Pine to life. After finishing Pine, you'll be able to explore the forest and maybe find your name there, along with everyone else who made a sizable contribution to the campaign.\nWe've also added a few add-ons since launching the campaign! The second and third are only available with reward tiers that already have a physical component.\n Woodworker carving STL file: This is the 3D model of the woodworker by Ismael Nieto. We had a couple requests for this add-on so that backers with their own 3D printers could print their own woodworker. For personal use only, of course!\n Additional prints and print bundles: If you've been reading the updates you know that there are now going to be a total of 7 images to select from. These add-ons let you get all the prints you want with your pledge! \n Additional carving mini figures: Our backers in the US can also add an additional carving mini figure to their pledge.\nThese handsome prints will be equally at home in your game room or museum room. Choose from the seven print options or let us know if there's a different image you have in mind and we'll see what we can do!\nThese prints will be signed by Tom and include a personal thank you note from him and Najati. You'll also get thanked in the credits after the story.\nYou're right, that woodworker figure isn't painted ... yet! When we were initially brainstorming ideas for this Kickstarter, the one thing we knew right away was that this amazing figure by Ismael Nieto (@ismaflcl) had to be one of the rewards.\nWe decided to take it one step further by having Tom paint them, making it a truly exceptional keepsake. Like the signed print, you'll get a personal thank you note from Tom and Najati and thanked in the credits after the story.\nTom's artistic talents aren't limited to the tablet. On special occasions he takes brush to canvas and putting Pine on Kickstarter is a very special occasion, indeed!\nThose able to support at this level will get one of five original paintings of a scene exclusive to this reward. These will be gouache on cold pressed paper and will ship ready for display or framing as you see fit!\nOf course, these include a thank you note from Tom and Najati and your name in the credits after the story. And yes, Tom has a lot of painting in store if we get funded!\nAnyone able to contribute at this level will be key to making Pine a reality! Your name will appear alongside the team at the beginning of the story, either as an individual or as a group. \nIn addition to getting one of every print and mini figure, you'll also get to choose one of the other limited rewards, and will of course get a thank you note from Tom and Najati. \nWe'd also like to say thank you directly and learn about why supporting Pine meant so much to you. So, if you're interested, we'll arrange a time for a video call with you.\nThe 8.5x11\" prints will ship worldwide through Fulfillrite, with tracking where possible, and delivered with duties paid where possible. If you live outside the list of countries where that service is available, you will be responsible for additional costs such as taxes and duties. Please check the FAQ to see which countries include duties paid.\nThe rest of the rewards are things we'll be making or packing ourselves and are limited in number. Since we're a small team, they'll only be available for shipping to the United States, with the exception of the Associate Producer rewards, which we'll ship worldwide.\nWe already have partners set up for making the physical rewards. Because some of those rewards depend on art that hasn't been created yet (e.g. the exclusive images for the wallpaper pack and Art of Pine PDF), we'll be developing those pieces first so we can get reward production and delivery started as soon as possible. \nSoon after funding, we'll publish an anticipated delivery schedule for the rewards. We're hoping the 8.5x11\" prints will ship over the summer and we're targeting shipping everything else before the holidays season of 2021.\nIn the spirit of transparency and community, we want to give potential backers some insight into our approach to funding and budgeting. There aren't any lovely images in this section but it's important to us that those pledging understand how we're using their money to develop Pine.\nFirst and foremost, our primary goal is to develop a high-quality, engaging, meaningful story-driven game so that you can experience the woodworker's story.\nWhile we'd love to just work on Pine and release it when it's ready without worrying about money, Pine is too big of a project to whittle away at in the evening and on weekends.\nWe think we've got about 15 months of work to do and we need to hire some outside help. The Kickstarter funding goes primarily towards hiring that help and enabling us to spend the time doing the work.\nHere's how the basic budget breaks down. These are estimates, but should be close to how the money gets spent.\n Kickstarter fees: 8% - We wouldn't be here without them!\n Rewards and shipping: 10% - Making and shipping the rewards \n Legal, accounting, etc: 2% - All companies need a little of this stuff\n Taxes: 15% - An estimate, and perhaps a conservative one\n Sound and music: 15% - Producing SFX and the score\n Art and programming: 50% - Most of what Pine needs is time for Tom and Najati to work on it!\nIf we're lucky enough to achieve any of our stretch goals, funding them comes out of the art and programming portion of the budget.\nAt our lowest goal of $80k, this is a shoestring budget even for a small team. However, everyone is committed to the project and we think that's just enough money to make a great game. For anyone curious, the project needs to reach about $300,000 before Tom and Najati aren't spending their savings to develop Pine. Any money beyond that would be invested back into Made Up Games so we can make more games!\nSo that's how your pledges will help us make Pine and, again, we're grateful for every one. If you made it this far, thanks for sticking around through this really boring section about money!\n\nMade Up Games is Tom Booth and Najati Imam. We're both lifelong gamers and longtime friends. After some practice publishing games with Freecell Fable\u2014and with your help\u2014we're ready to take on Pine!\nTom\u2019s been drawing since childhood and has been a professional illustrator for about 10 years, including stints at Nickelodeon and Scholastic. He's illustrated and authored a number of children\u2019s books including Don't Blink! and This is Christmas. His Instagram audience and its love for the woodworker is a large part of what inspired us to start this campaign!\n\nNajati\u2019s been programming since he was a kid and has been doing so professionally for over 20 years. His experience runs the gamut from web front end, to embedded systems programming, to directing engineering departments. He\u2019s also been tinkering with game dev for as long as he\u2019s been able to type. \n\nAndy's an industry vet who records forests for fun. He's the perfect person to weave the sounds of the woodworker's valley into the storytelling. Owner of Northwest Soundscapes, he's done sound design work for Lucasfilm and Sucker Punch Productions, among others.\n\nAdam is one part programmer, one part actor, and one part team coach. He and Najati used to work together so when it was time to blend technology, feelings, and art we pulled him into the team to keep us focused and keep the quality high.\n\nTwo parting notes ...\nWe expect it's clear from the tone of the campaign that Pine attempts to explore a fairly serious topic. While we want it to be a story that most anyone will be able to relate to, and maybe even feel enriched by, it's not intended to be a children's story. Because there won't be anything graphic or violent in it, Pine may end up with an E rating. We added this note to make sure that parents don't mistakenly take that to mean that Pine is intended for children.\nAlso, Made Up Games does not condone carving things into trees\u2014please don't do that! In a lot of places it's illegal, but even more importantly it can be really bad for the tree. The woodworker's story is a fictional one and he would definitely take forest conservation very seriously if he were real.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe biggest risk we foresee is whether we've estimated for enough time to live up to the high expectations we have for this project. We're confident in our ability to deliver, and we did our best to be reasonable with our estimates, but game development is a wily beast! We have contingency plans, but it would be na\u00efve to assume there won't be a few surprises along the way.\n\nSpeaking of surprises, there shouldn't be many for our backers as we're committed to being very transparent throughout the development of Pine. The dev updates will include progress on all fronts, from making and shipping the rewards to setbacks and successes during the development of Pine.\n\nRegarding publishing to the Switch: The barriers of entry to developing for the Nintendo Switch can be fairly high, with Nintendo controlling access to it tightly. If the project reaches that level of funding, we'll have resources available to tackle those challenges. Still, working with Nintendo is a considerable external dependency that we don't have complete control over.\n\nOur experience in fulfillment of physical goods is somewhat limited, but we've done our homework and think we've covered our bases there. We're confident in the partners we've selected to work with to produce the rewards and working with Fulfillrite removes all the risk around the shipping of the prints.\n\nWe're excited to bring Pine into the world. We're happy with the story we've written, our approach to telling it, and keen on our ability to execute. Risks exist, but we're ready to take on the challenges we face to make Pine a reality.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nReusability and recyclability\nWhere possible, shipping materials will be recycled and/or recyclable.\nSomething else\nFor all tiers above $25, we\u2019ll plant a tree for every backer that supports the project.

Destroying parts earns you additional dice for future rolls.\n2) The Machine Phase\nThe machine AI takes action, cycling the tracking die on each of its available machine part cards and triggering abilities when the die reaches an icon on its AI track -- potentially dealing damage, repairing, locking die, and impacting gameplay in other nefarious ways.\nWhen all of the machine parts have completed their cycle, the entire line shifts down one slot and a new machine part is added to the doom machine line, increasing the difficulty with each turn.\nCan you keep the machine at bay long enough to destroy the core and win?\nDownload the rules PDF right here or watch the how to play video below:\nTRY THE DEMO ON TABLETOP SIMULATOR\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2230741646\nNote for Tabletop Simulator controls: mousing over a die while pressing a number makes it flip instantly to that numbered die face.

Expect unique songwriting, modern classical orchestration and a hybrid of a concept album and an instrumental song-cycle.\nawesome photo credit: Peter Runkewitz - taken at Berliner Festspiele\nHow it began...\nWhen stargaze first met the singularly talented Arone Dyer (as part of her band Buke and Gase) at the German Haldern Pop festival in 2014, they were instantly blown away by her voice, presence and the brilliance of her/their compositions. \nTwo years later the singer and the European classical-contemporary ensemble found themselves in the same room at the somewhat legendary PEOPLE Festival and residency organised by Berlin's Michelberger Hotel, and curated by The National\u2019s Aaron and Bryce Dessner, as well as Bon Iver\u2019s Justin Vernon. stargaze was presented with the opportunity to arrange and collaborate on some of Arone's recent solo compositions and songs. Since those most inspiring sessions there has always been a small but enduring light flickering in the back of their minds: if one day they could make an album together... So they reached out to each other in the middle of 2020, when it became clear that there wasn't going to be much performing or touring possible any time soon; A hiatus and scary situation, but also a creative chance and THE moment for our project. \n\nAnd now we are at the point where we can say that a dream is about to come true, but we need YOUR HELP to make it happen: to come together when it's possible again, to rehearse, book a studio and record the music which Arone and stargaze are co-writing and arranging at the moment remotely, in a truly 2021 transatlantic bridge of solidarity and creativity.\nMusic vs Covid\nAt this extraordinary time, as the vast majority of musicians have been almost entirely erased from their typical work-cycle, we've lost the income we would typically make from in-person performance or touring. This, and dampened record sales in the time of online streaming negates any potential income that we would typically put towards the creation of new work. As an unregulated, unsupported service-based industry, our hands are tied behind our backs. This plea for help means more to us now than ever before!\n\nWe invite you to become part of our creative musical process and join us on the way to something great! By donating to this campaign, we can realise funding for:\n- the 13 talented performing/recording freelance musicians in stargaze, for their valuable time, effort given during a time when the whole world has been asked to remain static\n- studio rental costs\n- engineer fees\n- any equipment necessary for larger instruments or difficult arrangements that need to be recorded as a group\n- travel costs for musicians when group recording is required\n- travel costs to get Arone to the EU for writing/arrangement when possible\n- arrangement work\n- advance for physical album production costs\n- fee for visual artwork on the album (by the upcoming and talented artist Lily Morris)\nVisual artwork by Lilly Morris\nWho we are\nstargaze has initiated and created many genre bending and boundary breaking collaborations with the likes of Nils Frahm, Villagers, Poli\u00e7a, Owen Pallett, K\u00e4ptn Peng and many more. We get invited regular by major concert venues including Hamburg\u2019s Elbphilharmonie, the Barbican Centre and Paris\u2019 Philharmonie. Arone Dyer is a founding member of duos Buke and Gase and Mistresses, the producer of Dronechoir, a project which examines social dis/comfort through long-durational choral performance, and musical collaborator with an extensive resume of appearances. Her band Buke and Gase has been dubbed anything between an \u2018avantgarde indie rock obsession\u2019 and \u2018steampunk art-folk\u2019, just as uncategorisable as Arone\u2019s vocal style is original and emotionally direct.\nPlanning\nArone and stargaze have already started recording new ideas and demos remotely. Material is being gathered until the time when we can come together in a studio and collaborate in person, recording this special new album that we believe will make people happy and moved. This campaign is designed to make it possible, and with the goal that as many fans will get to experience this unique sound and collaboration between Arone and stargaze.\n\nJan - Kickstarter launched Work begins! \nFeb - Kickstarter campain ends, inform all contributors\nMar - Recording/writing demos continues\nMay-June - fulfill dinners, fulfill lessons/recording sessions for campaign contributors; invites to stargaze Festival at Berlin Volksb\u00fchne (unless postponed to September due to Covid)\nJul - fulfill other rewards for campaign contributors; final demos and arrangements are written/prepared\nAug - stargaze gets together in EU for rehearsing; recording first single remotely; exclusive download of first mix prepared; fullfill guestlist invitations at festivals (where possible)\nSept - recording full album in studio with Arone in Europe; insta sessions/exclusive gig\nOct - overdubs/touch-ups/edits\nNov - Mix/Master; work on video/promo material \nDec - Digital prerelease for contributors\nJan - Music video prerelease to contributors\nFeb - release first single/video; exclusive launch concert\nMar - Full album release \nPLAY\n\nWe believe that making music together remotely has helped us to stay in touch, encourage and support each other as artists, and to overcome and channel our deepest fears about the time we live in and realities we face wherever we are. Music, or rather the act of creating music together, is proving again to be the ultimate connector, the social glue and remedy.\nAnd not least, we believe in launching Arone as a solo artist and composer on record, a voice we believe deserves widespread attention.\nWhat will you receive?\nThe working album title is \"Arachne Versus\" - inspired by the Greek myth of Arachne, where a young talented girl challenges the Gods to a weaving contest and is transformed into a spider. \"Arachne Versus\" implicates the web we must work with to create, or weave, this project/sonic tapestry despite forced distance and solitude.

In 2016 I won The Best Colorist award at Alternate Showcase of Animation and Comics poll awards.You can see my more recent work at www.instagram.com/rnugentcolors.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe only risks we have are delays in printing and shipping.

I will not reprint this physical edition. If you miss out and want to get the content, Tower of Scoundrels is available in digital format at DrivethruRPG. (Of course, as with everything, even the digital release may not be available forever. The world is constantly changing.) \n\nDigital mockup of the album cover and vinyl record. Please note that this is a mockup and not final. The image was constructed on a 45 RPM record, so this is more accurate to the final appearance than any of the other mockups shown in this campaign.\n\nWithin this 7\u201d album you will find the Tower of Scoundrels, an adventure designed for use with the M\u00f6rk Borg roleplaying game.\nThis adventure includes the outer album cover \u2013 which can be used as a micro-GM screen \u2013 two booklets that detail the tower as well as what is hidden beneath the tower, and a 7\u201d vinyl record of atmospheric tunes.\nTower of Scoundrels is intended for experienced gamemasters. You will need the official M\u00f6rk Borg roleplaying game, dice, pencils, paper, friends, and imagination to use this adventure. A record player is required to listen to the included album.\nOne printing only! This limited edition package will not be printed again. I'm planning for a run of 500 records in print. (Adjusted upward if necessary to cover the Kickstarter rewards.) Copies remaining after fulfillment will be available in a future project.\nDigital mockup of the two booklets. Book One details the tower. Book Two describes what is below the tower.\nYou can hear both sides of the vinyl record right now! NOTE: The final music may vary slightly; the music is being remastered by an audio engineer specifically for vinyl, so there may be slight variations between the digital mastering and vinyl mastering.\nSo that we don't risk causing delays, there are no project stretch goals. The music is complete (as well as professionally mastered), the booklets are written, and the project is ready to go. The only possible change will be upgrading the gatefold to a triple-panel instead of the double-panel, but that change will be based on info from the printer and not rely on stretch goals.\nWhen the campaign ends, I'll deliver PDFs to all backers and run the project through a one-week review stage so we can try to crush any typos that I may have missed. Then I'll officially start the manufacturing process. \n\n\nBook One interior page spread mockup. Each booklet is 6\" x 6\" in size. Book one is twelve pages. Book two is eight pages.\nWith over two decades of experience in the game industry, Philip has created hundreds of PDFs, books, and games . . . but this is his first time experimenting with music. Both tracks (one on each side of the 7\" record) were produced using the Soundtrap tools where Philip layered sound effects and loops, manipulating all of the different elements in the software. Once complete, both tracks are processed through Soundcloud's mastering tools that expand the richness and depth of the music as computers perform their audio mastering magic.\nIn addition to the music, Philip also handled the writing, graphic design, and layout of the album sleeve and two booklets. Please see the copyright notice, below, for more information on the art and maps. \n\u00a9 2021 Philip Reed. Map and tower graphics \u00a9 Dyson Logos, used with permission.

And the genderless communist era of \"no breasts\"? Perhaps only men can appreciate boobs, because every woman I know, struggles with them.\nMe? Even worse! Born as an only-child in China, I was raised up as a boy. When my breasts started to grow, they immediately become the struggle of my life. Almost two monsters that never get out of my sight. I tried to hide them by all means even until today. But right now, as an adult filmmaker, I propose to animate them and confront them in a film!  \nThe Handsome Me and Family Planning Poster\nThat was the simple beginning of the project. However, after looking back at all the memories of binding myself in cellophanes, dreaming of a flat chest, learning to show them proudly, I realised that a lot of things have changed, not only my own opinions, but also, the society's attitude towards women's bodies and sex culture. \nWhat has happened? Is that more of a liberation or just another prison?\nI hate to say it, but the constant struggle with women\u2019s body goes on and on. The difference in turn, shows that a society has changed. The memories of a generation in China can actually be told through the story of boobs and the role of women in society.\n\nThe 90-minute film will adapt a hybrid form with archive, animation, fiction and documentary elements. A humorous approach and a decided style will be used. Two breasts animation will be created as the narrator of the film.\nAnimation Reference\nIt will follow a chapter based and chronological order of my personal life from I was born till today, meanwhile reflecting the influence of one child policy, gender inequality, sex education, globalisation, life in diaspora and the seemly absurd sex culture in China historically and today. Something the society has chosen to be silent about. \nMoodboard\nThrough the role of breasts and sexuality to a coming-of-age story, we follow 30 years of a culture and a society. It is not only to reflects on my own memory and struggles, but also to understand the society on women and the relationship with our bodies and culture.\n\nThe film has participated in several project labs and festival markets, including, IDFAcademy, Berlinale Doc Station and SoundImageCulture. In April 2021, we set to begin the first shooting period, which is where your support will lead to. \nIDFAcademy Workshop For Pitching and Co-production\n\nIn return to your boobie love, I wanted to create rewards that are both fun and unique.

If the pandemic does not allow foreign crew to enter, the director, as a Chinese citizen will form a local crew to continue the shooting.\nThe film is a feature length hybrid form with animation. We have been looking for great animation artist to collaborate with.\nOne of the biggest risk to consider is the political layer of the film. As the sensitivity of some topics may create issues, we will need to take this factor into consideration.\nA big challenge of the film is to tell a personal story to relate to an international audience. The campaign create a great chance for me to hear the voice of others around the globe. I am confident that the Chinese story is also a sneak peak into a Culture that is different and far to trigger a global question question of feminism.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u20ac5 or more", "title": "Nipple", "descp": "Nipple is the top of everything and nipplegasm is real.

Thanks everyone!\nThanks to your incredible support, we've reached our goal! Our new stretch goal is $40K.  Let's do this! Thank you everyone!\nIn just 9 days, we've hit our goal. We can't thank you enough! The story of Joe Keithley and the power of music and activism has clearly struck a nerve.  The entire \"Something Better Change\" team is incredibly grateful and thankful to you for how far we've come so far.\nLet's keep the momentum going\u2014indie filmmaking is full of surprises and every additional dollar we receive means we can put it back into the film for additional post-production expenses, music licensing and more to give you\u2014the audience\u2014the best film we can make.\nPLAY\n\nSomething Better Change\nFilm Summary:\nThroughout the 1980s, bands like D.O.A. helped define the decade's deafening hardcore punk sound, paving the way for the eventual explosion of punk groups through radio and MTV in the decades to come. While punk rock's upper echelon may no longer be as culturally seditious as they once were,  the genre's effect on a new generation of activists and aspiring politicians has never been more clear.\n\nIn 2018, after 40 years of fighting against oppression, homelessness and corporate greed in the U.S. and in his native Canada, D.O.A. frontman, activist and cultural politician Joey \u201cShithead\" Keithley decided to turn art into life and run against the outspoken Mayor of Burnaby (population: 250,000), Derek Corrigan. Against all odds\u2014and with only a $7000 campaign budget\u2014Keithley won a city councillor seat in Burnaby, BC that year and helped to unseat the entrenched five-term Corrigan who once famously said, \u201cI would never bend over to give a homeless person a dime because he might steal my watch.\"\n\nWill Keithley's message and DIY approach to campaigning resonate with voters in the upcoming Burnaby election of 2022? Win or lose, we will document him every step of the way as he campaigns for a second term. This is a film that will explore how music and activism continue to interlink, with music often serving as an introduction to social issues that inspire people to get involved and foster dynamic change.\nPete Seeger, Arlo Guthrie, Brian and Joey \"Shithead\" Keithley, 1986. Photo by Connie Kuhns.\nWhy Crowdfunding?\nCrowdfunding is an essential tool for indie filmmakers like myself. I'm passionate about the communal aspect of the process and how it allows for a type of creative freedom and autonomy that traditional investing doesn't always guarantee. This film is more than just a music documentary\u2014this is a story of a man who not only fronted one of the most vital and important punk bands of the last 40 years, but has consistently maintained his commitment to working on social issues like racism, fascism, homelessness, and the environment.\nAutographed by Joe Keithley official movie poster 18x24\" poster available available in our rewards!\nWhat We Need & What You Get:\nAs you know, a project of this magnitude takes time and money\u2014and as we are approaching the next election cycle, time is of the essence. If we successfully reach our goal, we will use the funds to pay for the following:\nmusic licensing fees\ntravel/location costs\narchival usage fees\npost-production costs (editing, sound, color, etc.)\nadditional A/V needs\ninsurance\nlegal representation\nfulfillment costs\nAll of these are necessary to create a film we can all be proud of\u2014but most importantly, one that tells the story of Joe Keithley and D.O.A. in a way that resonates with both his fans and documentary enthusiasts around the world. This is truly an inspiring underdog, DIY story that has broad appeal. We have begun production on the film with a very, very modest investment, but we need additional funds to really get the ball rolling.  \nCan We Exceed Our Goal?\nWe are hopeful we can exceed our funding goal, and if so, we will use the additional budget for bonus content, promotion and any unexpected costs along the way (a certainty with independent filmmaking).\nHow You Can Help \nAs you know, this film is only going to be possible with your help. This film belongs to you as much as it does to us.  The more people who participate, the more chance we have of getting the story out.

His first film was \"Salad Days: A Decade of Punk in Washington, DC\" and the follow-up was \"CREEM: America's Only Rock'n'Roll Magazine.\" Both films received critical acclaim and multiple film festival awards.

With your help, I want to take my next project much further, with a longer story, many more characters, and a longer production time to get the best out of me. I think I have a really special story with a solid and funny script, so I hope you can help me make it real!\nHi, Eraser!\n STORY\n\u2018Homework\u2019 begins as a normal day for our main character, a regular pencil, who after some unexpected events, will need to get out of his comfort zone and go into an adventure far from his desk that will change the rest of his life. The story is full of little characters that will have their moment to shine and make us laugh while we get to know them.\nEarly in the story scene - Storyboard\nStoryboard - Gum under the table is finally useful\nMost of my stories rely on funny twists and original ideas, so even if I have the full script and storyboard for it, I want you to first experience it when you watch the final animation. I'm aiming for a duration of around 6-8 minutes for this short-film.\n\nWork In Progress\nCHARACTERS\nMeet Sticky!\nAside from the main characters, a pencil and an eraser, many other characters will make their appearance. Each of them has their own personality, role in their 'society' and more importantly, importance in the story. \nHi, this is Clippy!\nSome of the characters of 'Homework'\nCreating characters is what I do best, I've been creating funny characters and situations for over a decade. These characters granted me the privilege to have over half a million followers of my illustrations and to work on some amazing projects with brands like Playstation, Netflix, Pilot, Peak, Nestle, and many more. \nStarting doing animation was a risky move, you don't change something that's working so well. While I miss sharing my work with my followers every week, as animation takes much longer to create, I feel that I've found the perfect recipe for my development as an artist.\nSome of Naolito's illustration work\n\nPHYSICAL REWARDS\nI've been creating products with my artwork for over a decade for my online and retail stores and distributors, so I have extensive experience and a long list of reliable providers who have been creating quality products for me during all this time.\n\nENAMEL PIN SET\nEnamel Pin set preview - 35mm/1.5in\n#2: Crayons Box - MOVING ENAMEL PIN\nPLAY\n\nMoving Enamel Pin - Crayons Box (preview) - 35mm/1.5in (It has an interactive mechanism!)\n\n#3: Notepad - MOVING ENAMEL PIN \n\nMoving Enamel Pin - Notepad (preview) - 35mm/1.5in (It has an interactive mechanism!)\nSTICKERS PACK\n Includes different stickers with 12 different characters.\n12 characters - 10cm/4in depending on the character.\nART PRINT - A4 signed and numbered, printed on fine art 300gr paper.

Storytelling is my passion, so I feel that animation allows me to create a much better representation of my concepts and characters. To my surprise, people seemed to love my animations from the very first day, so I kept creating and sharing them with my +600k followers on Instagram who support my work on a daily basis.\nCreator Nacho D\u00edaz Arjona - Naolito\nI included some extracts of my short animations done in 2020, but if you want to see the complete version of them, you can watch this video to enjoy 4 minutes of cuteness.\n WHY KICKSTARTER?\nThis is an independent project as it gets. Naolito is just one person, with your support, you\u2019re making it possible for me to dedicate full time to the creation of it, and if support is big enough, hiring additional professionals to make it get to the next level.\n\nFor the last year, I\u2019ve been using my free time to give my characters an extra dose of life thanks to animation. It comes with a cost though, while the illustration is pretty straightforward, the animation is more complex and time-consuming.\n              In addition to that, it\u2019s harder to monetize, so it\u2019s not easy to dedicate time to it, so I end up working for brands instead of dedicating more time to my characters. \nI'll be the one doing all locations, assets, characters, animations, editing, music, etc. Even working alone, 3d is really expensive, this is the reason why most kids 3d shows look as plain and bad as they look, they cut corners in all areas, including rendering, to keep costs as low as possible. As I planned this project, all funds will go directly to render farm & software costs, in order to ensure we can get a short film that looks amazing. \nWith your support, I hope to be able to work full time on the creation of \u2018HOMEWORK\u2019 and hopefully many more stories. Working full time on it means longer stories, better-looking characters and scenarios, and hopefully, even bigger projects in the future.\nSTRETCH GOALS\n+125% FUNDED! I could never have imagined such a great reception for this project, thank you so much for your incredible support! It's overwhelming to see a project I've put so many hours and effort into like this one supported by so many people.  Let's make it even bigger with some Stretch goals!\nThank you so much for your support!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is my 2nd Kickstarter project and I am confident we can manage all the steps to make this project a success. We have already completed the first steps, defining the bases of the storyline and creating the main characters, and I have experience creating complex animation in a much shorter span of time.\nRegarding physical rewards, in addition to being my second Kickstarter project, I've run my online store for over 10 years now, shipping all kinds of products all over the world. \nI also have a decade of experience working with different suppliers of all kinds of products. This experience is extremely important to ensure that all products are created under the highest quality standards.\nWhen it comes to shipping, we're always exposed to an unexpected event or delay, but my goal is always to be responsive when someone has an issue and to get it solved.\nHowever, should a production or shipping delay occur, I will inform everyone with frequent project updates. I understand that updates are important, so I will do our best to keep you constantly informed.\nI will continue to work hard beyond this project creating some new and creative stuff, so we ask you to continue to follow and believe in my work.\nThank you!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u20ac1 or more", "title": "Thank you", "descp": "Thank from creator @Naolito's Instagram stories", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Feb 2021"}], "stat": ["18 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac5 or more", "title": "Digital download", "descp": "A digital download of my 3d animated short film Homework.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2021"}], "stat": ["120 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac10 or more", "title": "Premium digital download", "descp": "Includes:\n- Digital Download of Homework short-film\n- All my previous short animations\n- Access to all behind the scenes content", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2021"}], "stat": ["242 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac20 or more", "title": "Physical edition", "descp": "Includes:\n- Homework short film physical copy\n- All my previous animations\n- Behind the scenes content\n- Premium digital download of Homework", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["47 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac20 or more", "title": "Enamel Pin Set - Pencil + Eraser", "descp": "Includes:\n- Enamel Pin Set of Pencil and Eraser\n- Premium digital download of Homework", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["77 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac20 or more", "title": "Stickers set (12)", "descp": "- Sticker set of 12 stickers featuring all characters from Homework\n- Premium digital download of Homework", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["35 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac20 or more", "title": "Moving Enamel Pin - Crayons Box", "descp": "Includes:\n- Moving Enamel Pin (with an interactive moving mechanism!)\n- Premium digital download of Homework", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["5 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac20 or more", "title": "Moving Enamel Pin - Notepad", "descp": "Includes:\n- Notepad - Moving Enamel Pin (with an interactive moving mechanism!)\n- Premium digital download of Homework", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["7 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac40 or more", "title": "Limited Edition 1/1 Art Print", "descp": "- Signed and numbered (1/1) art print from a frame from the film.

I just wanted to give you a production update on the short film, there's a lot going on that I'd like to share with you.\n\nIf you follow me on Instagram, you probably have seen that I'm hiring 3d artists. Why is that? When you supported this project, you changed my life, and Naolito as a unipersonal project, forever. Initially, this was a solo project, and while I received a lot of messages of people offering to help me in the creation of the short film, I couldn't afford to pay any extra artists, as all Kickstarter funding would go directly into rendering farms, software and reward products.  \n\n3 months later, we're in a very different, and better, situation. Thanks to this project, and thanks to your support, aside from gaining some weight from working non-stop, my 3d work got a lot of attention, I got 3d gigs, I got some crazy offers, and most importantly, I got additional funding for additional projects and the short film. So even if was already playing with the idea of hiring some additional help to be able to keep pushing all my projects, this new situation allows me to think bigger, so Naolito is becoming a full-fledged animation studio.\n\nObviously, this has a direct impact on my initial planning for the short film. A solo project is more streamlined, and while the final result is probably not as good, production times are much shorter. With a big team working on it, production times get much longer, you need a lot more coordination, you can't overwork your staff the way I do it with myself, etc. But this also means that the quality level you can achieve is on a whole different level."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #8", "update_userinfo": "\ud83d\udc8c Some project and deadline updates", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #7", "update_userinfo": "\u270f\ufe0f'Homework' updates and a little scoop for you\ud83c\udf0e", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #6", "update_userinfo": "We did it! 148% funded & 718 backers!

Will you seek to ruin just one captain and their wretched ship, or will you bring down the rest as well? What intrigues can you leverage within this community of thieves? What secrets can you line your pockets with? What other treasures are hidden, waiting to be found for those clever and determined enough?\nMap of Corpsewake Cove\nThere\u2019s a lot we\u2019ve got squished onto these 32+ pages, including:\nD10 table of possible ways the pirates ruined your life - everything from stealing your curtains to murdering your dog\n3 custom backgrounds for PCs who want something other than revenge: The Dewey-Eyed Pirate Wannabe: fake it till you make it; The Bounty Hunter: get your mark, get your pay; The Treasure-Crazed Lunatic: get rich or die trying.\nThe complete text for how to play the adventure including traps and puzzles\nDescriptions of key NPCs with stat blocks and portraits\nBestiary including stats and images\nThe Fearsome Manticore and the Not-to-be-spoken-of Ex-Parrot\nD20 table of random encounters on the streets of Corpsewake Cove\nAdventure-wide map, as well as key location maps and descriptions\nD100 table of pirate booty\n...and big, splashy illustrations to bring the text to life in a punk-art, graphic style.\n\nWhat's Mork Borg?\nM\u00d6RK BORG hit the Roleplaying Game world a year or so ago, and we have been itching to try our hand at making something in the genre since then. In Mork Borg, the world has really truly gone to to shit. It's dying, and everyone knows we're making-do till it finally all falls apart. But in these bleak times we can still get a little scratch and try to find some sliver of satisfaction. The art blends punk, the cut-and-paste zine approach, and elements of dadaism and thrash metal graphics. We made a one-page dungeon for M\u00d6RK BORG as part of Dissident Whispers (which also happened to be Madeleine's first try at making an isometric map!) and really liked the taste.\nCorpsewake Cove is our first adventurous foray into the graphic and thematic world of M\u00d6RK BORG. Bright, gritty illustrations accompany evocative text - a mad run on the rough streets of a pirate town, to the harbor beyond, and slogging desperately through the cadaver-clogged sewers below. Chock full of swashbuckling, zombie-burning, rabble rousing, and pirate murdering! The tone is grim as the grave - you will take revenge for what the pirates did to you and your family. But there\u2019s also plenty of room for bleak nihilism and a bit of graveyard humor.\nBut, hey, don't take our word for it. In the words of M\u00d6RK BORG's creators:\n\"M\u00d6RK BORG is a blackened artpunk doomsday rpg about miserable bastards and heretics enduring a bleak, dying world. It's a doom metal album of a game. A spiked flail to the face. Rules light, heavy everything else. It's made by Pelle Nilsson of Ockult \u00d6rtm\u00e4stare Games and Johan Nohr from Stockholm Kartell, and published by Free League Publishing. Check it out here, you might like it.\"\nThe Dreaded Frankenshark (ooooooooo scary)\nFulfillment\nEvery backer will get the pdf through itch, and/or DriveThruRPG - your choice.\nWe're big believers in the importance of print and being able to hold the book and show it off at the table (and with art like this, you'll want to show it off!) We're offering two options for printing:\n1.Print-On-Demand. Every backer will get codes to print at cost through DriveThruRPG in both saddle-stapled softcover and hardcover with their premium color printing. This means that you will pay them to print and ship Corpsewake Cove to you at a later point. As of right now, it looks like it's about $4 to print the softcover and $8 to print the hardcover. The plus side of this is that you can get a hardcover copy but more importantly, DriveThruRPG has printing and shipping facilities all over the world, making it less terrifyingly expensive to ship internationally.\n2. The \"Official\" Print Run. For our US backers, we will print the \"official\" version through Mixam. In our opinion, the quality of the printing is a step up on their HP Indigo 7600 digital press. We'll be printing full-color on 100# uncoated paper with a boss, gloss laminated, 130# cover. It will feel so good in your hands and look incredible. We've printed a number of products with Mixam and they are always impressive to see.\nThe Timeline\nThe writing and much of the illustration is complete already! During this campaign, we will be going through the layout process. In an ideal world (which we haven't had recently), we would like to get the pdf to you in early February, shortly after the campaign wraps, and deliver the Mixam printed zines in March. To be on the safe side, though, we're saying March for the PDF, April for the printed books. This would be our first printing through DriveThruRPG, so we would expect that may require some additional time getting it just right.\nWho is Ember + Ash?\nThis adventure and every illustration in it is a creation of Ember + Ash Games (@ByEmberAndAsh, www.byemberandash.com).

It has a thick front and back cover. Includes a matte black golf pencil that slides perfectly into the spiral binding, and a black and white d6 that you can carry along as well.\nSample pages (Subject to change)\n\n\n\nHow to play:\nGameplay is simple but entertaining: you roll a 6-sided die to determine how far you'll move each turn. Then pick a direction, draw a line, and interact with anything on that line, be it a monster (ouch!) some treasure (nice!) or a teleporter (cool!).\nCustomize your character, roll your way through each floor, and get items at the shops sprinkled throughout the game. There's even a page in the back to track stats like how many times you died -- so if you die, don't worry! It's all part of the adventure.\n\nYou can get a PDF of sample rules and level here\n\nTesting a prototype\n\nHow I'm making it:\nI am using software called Drawbot that allows me to code a level generator in Python. This generates PDFs which I will send to a local printer to get the notebooks made. This means that each game pad is different - each one has random level layouts and different shops. So if you get more than one game pad, you'll have different levels to play!\n\nLevels are generated with Python code using Drawbot\n\n\nWhy I'm making it:\nI feel compelled to cut games down to their bones and to see what makes them tick. In that spirit, I'm trying to strip this genre down to its simplest form: 1 player, simple mechanics, no story-telling, just you, a die and pencil, and a series of simple decisions in the face of randomness. \n\nAs a product designer, I have been thinking for a long time about the concept of \"paper apps\". In fact I've created one already. Sometimes you want to do something during a dull moment, but don't want to get sucked into your phone screen. Paper apps fill that gap with discrete, screen-free experiences that respect your time and attention. Eventually I plan on creating a whole Paper App Library (PAL) that will include all sorts of little notebook \"apps\", including games and utilities.\n\nAbout me:\nI've been creating games since I first learned to program in QBASIC as a kid. I have published several video games and even published a tabletop game on Kickstarter back in 2013. I am interested in game design, graphic design, and product design. \nPaper Apps is a joint effort of my video game company, Beep Yeah!, and the design company I run with my wife, Gladden.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe main risk involves getting printed and shipped. However, I have made \"paper apps\" like this before and I have a process in place. COVID restrictions may slow things down, but only by a week or two.

Most of it is created by our wonderful community and will be (or already is) made available for free download on morkborg.com, but there is also exclusive official material.\nIn this Kickstarter is also the official M\u00d6RK BORG GM screen, and a box full of almost-forgotten gods. \n\n\u2716 Thank you Terra Tenebrosa for letting us use the track The Arc of Descent from the album The Tunnels in the Kickstarter video. If you're looking for feverous, experimental black/post-metal, check it out here. \nThis is what this godless tome will look like\nPunish your ears\nTo get into the proper mood, we created this Spotify playlist. Put it on while reading this Kickstarter, and/or when playing M\u00d6RK BORG.\n\u2716 M\u00d6RK BORG is a blackened artpunk doomsday RPG about miserable bastards and heretics enduring a bleak, dying world. It's a doom metal album of a game. A spiked flail to the face. Rules light, heavy everything else. It's made by Pelle Nilsson of Ockult \u00d6rtm\u00e4stare Games and Johan Nohr from Stockholm Kartell, and published by Free League Publishing. Check it out here, you might like it.\nSome people said this\n\n\u2716 M\u00d6RK BORG CULT (MBC) is our sub-label for selected, approved and curated M\u00d6RK BORG content by the community. Basically, you send us homebrew stuff and if we like it and it follows our guidelines, we make some edits, art and lay it out before publishing it for free download on morkborg.com. Digital MBC content (including that of zines like this) will always be free, but this is a chance to get some of it in high-quality print form. I mean, you can download the content for free and print it at home too if you want. \n\u2716 Since a few days ago, we are also putting the submissions to MBC on pause. When we started this project we had NO IDEA we would receive as much content as we are, and since we're also working on forthcoming books etc, we simply can't keep up with the demand. So we close it down for a bit, until we've cleared the backlog, at which point we can open it up again.  \n\n\u2716 About six months ago we Kickstarted M\u00d6RK BORG CULT: FERETORY, the first MBC zine. It was a much bigger success than we could have imagined and an unbelievable 1792 backers helped us realize the project. Since then we have received a TON of awesome content submitted to the Cult and we want to collect it into a physical zine once more. So, if you're familiar with MBC: FERETORY, you know the drill. This is pretty much the exact same thing. Oh, and there's also the Official M\u00d6RK BORG Game Master's Screen of Doom and the mysterious shrine IKHON. We'll get to that. \nM\u00d6RK BORG CULT: HERETIC is published by Free League Publishing, same as M\u00d6RK BORG and M\u00d6RK BORG CULT: FERETORY was. They will handle printing, distribution and digital fulfillment.\n  All these either are or will be available for free download on morkborg.com\n Adventure: Graves Left Wanting. The PCs find themselves buried alive in the vast, ever-changing cemetery of Graven-Tosk. This dark and weird tombcrawl is suitable as a campaign starter or a post-TPK adventure. By Karl Druid \n Adventure: Sepulchre of the Swamp Witch. In a hidden repository deep in the Slithering Swamp is a witch's altar of glyph-covered roots. They say it can fulfill any wish. Could stopping the approaching Doom be within its powers? Only one way to find out. By Christian Sahl\u00e9n. \n Adventure: Bloat. Villagers disappear. Tracks lead to an underground temple of bacchanalian frenzy, reeking of rot, offal and bile. Find them and sate your hunger. By Greg Saunders. \n Rules: Unheroic Feats. Enhance and personalize your classless characters with these optional advancement rules. By Johnny Carhat. \n Class: Sacrilegious Songbird. You struck a deal with a devil and since that woeful day your soul screams but your throat sings sweetly. And so does your purse. A small price to pay. By Karl Druid. \n Class: Shedding Vicar. Armor is weak, clothes a sin and your very skin an abhorrent vanity. Best to remove it all and walk peeled, clean and glistening wet into the night. By Cameron James. \n Creature: The Merchant. Cursed with eternal life and destined to roam the world trading shards of souls for ruinous relics. You never know when this mysterious monger might appear. Will you make a deal? By Johnny Carhat. \n Creature: The Bone Bowyer. This horrid fey lurks in the tangled depths of Sarkash where it fashions heart-seeking bone bows and blood-dyed cloaks from the flesh of the lost. By Matthew Bottiglieri. \n Rules: Blackpowder Weapons for the Rich and Foolhardy. The world is ending, so let's end it with a BANG. These optional rules are the spark that adds fire- to your fights. Whether it's a pepperbox or a ribauldequin, you can be assured these things are loud and deadly. By Ian McClung. \n\nThese are exclusive to the zine and will not be made available for free download. These will not only be included in the printed zine, but will also come translated to Swedish as a digital appendix to the PDF version. \n Creature: Borg Bitor. Vile, insectoid, parasitic creatures creeping into houses and nurseries come nighttime. There is a baby. There is an egg. Don't let them become one.\n Creature: Rotting Nurse. Many a Galgenbeckian remembers Mikol's infirmary and its gruesome experiments exposed by the inquisition. The head surgeon was jailed but whatever really happened to his accomplices, the nurses? Their lengthy, cruel punishment and vivisepulture. The empty graves. The shimmer from the starless skies. The many-legged horses carrying the bodies away... for what purpose?  \n 250.000 SEK STRETCH GOAL Adventure: Nurse the Rot. As you put Mother Marathuk\u2014the aunt of one of you dregs\u2014to her final rest, the village Tunstal is set in complete darkness, leaving it to its doom unless something is done. \n Rules: Curses and Cures. So you opened the puzzle box, whistled in the old mine or carelessly removed the protecting wards? These curses will be the consequence. Luckily, there are ways to break them, but it comes at a cost. \n\n\u2716 Our goal is to make this zine similar to M\u00d6RK BORG CULT: FERETORY, meaning something quite different from the M\u00d6RK BORG  core book. This is a rough zine, a haphazardly composited collection of ideas and articles, and we want it to feel like something you'd pick up at a concert or an underground art fair. It'll be a soft-cover zine, about 60-ish A5 pages thick, printed on heavily textured uncoated paper in 7 colors (CMYK+3), with some extra things metallic foiling and golden staples or who knows? You know, a typical zine.\nThe zine will only be printed in English, but the things written by Pelle and Johan will be included in Swedish in a digital Appendix.\n\n Introducing: The M\u00d6RK BORG Screen of Doom* \n*not really the name. OR IS IT?\n\u2716 Since the release of M\u00d6RK BORG we have seen quite a few awesome custom-made GM screens made, and now we want to offer you guys our take on it. This will be a beast of a screen; small but versatile. \nA five-paneled A5 portrait wall of death \nPrinted with gold metallic ink on one side and vivid neon yellow on the other. We want the screen to scream in your face when you run the game. \nShould we reach the 325.000 SEK stretch goal, we'll even equip each screen with two pairs of photo corners (for lack of a better name) that can hold A5 sheets with whatever tables or notes you want. So that you don't have to use that sharpie on the screen (I mean you still can, but you don't have to). Think old-school photo album, but for your adventure notes.\n Available in both English and Swedish. You pick the language you want in a post-Kickstarter Pledge Manager.\n\nThe back has a ton of more or less useful tables. If we reach the Stretch goal you can even change two of the panels to have whatever reference tables, adventure notes and/or profane poetry you prefer.\n The front is all art, five scenes of various locales and important characters in the Dying world, from SHE in the mountains of Bergen Chrypt to the endless graveyard Graven-Tosk beneath the Shadowking's palace. \n The GM-facing side sports a wide array of tables and rules summaries that might come in handy during play, such as an NPC generator, equipment and Powers, combat summary (with an optional hit location table), generic enemy stat-blocks and a d100 list of random junk you can find when looting the cultists' coffers (previously printed in MBC: FERETORY and available on morkborg.com). \n\n\nOne more thing\nForged by the left hand of Nechrubel, bound in cured skin and soot-black wood, the ancient god-vessels known as IKHONs are detested by the Two-Headed Basilisks. Wielding their Powers, unfettering the Profane Profound shackled within is a serious heretical crime and whoever may carry these blackened shrines will be forever hunted by the inquisition. But perhaps it is worth it. \nEarly mockup. Might change. You never know with these things.\n\u2716 IKHON is a mysterious box. A gaol keeping four almost-forgotten folk gods at bay; the Bilkherd, the Becklure, the Old Dead and the dreaded Silkfiend.  Those who dare commune with them are promised great rewards. But life and death go hand in hand and too small a sacrifice could be perceived as an insult. This gift could very well be a curse. IKHON is an\n a6 box with rules on how to unfetter the Profane Profound. While you can never choose which one to summon and how they'll react, (willing) human sacrifice will tip the odds slightly in your favor. Within are\n four tracts, one for each god-creature, detailing their gifts and punishments. Each a 24 page A6 booklet. \n Available in both English and Swedish. You pick the language you want in a post-Kickstarter Pledge Manager.\nWritten by Pelle Nilsson but torn apart and rebuilt in a stranger, darker form by Fiona Maeve Geist and Jarrett Crader of the MoonRat Conspiracy.  \n Over 40 full-page illustrations by the masterful Paraguayan artist Samuel Araya, whose oil paintings will bring the Profane Profound to blasphemous life. This is but one of them, giving you an idea of the kind of aesthetic this thing will have:\nOne of these mysterious, bene/malevolent deities.\n\nPledge levels and what they include\nWe got some stretch goals, in case we should get more funds than we need to just make the zine, screen and IKHON happen:\n 100.000 SEK We make this thing, simple as that.\n 175.000 SEK No zine is complete without silver foil details! If we hit this Stretch Goal we'll add a bit of shine to one of the pages.\n 250.000 SEK  We include the official and zine exclusive adventure Nurse the Rot (check the Stuff by Pelle and Johan section above for more details). \n  325.000 SEK We equip the GM screen with two pairs of photo corners allowing you to customize it with your own reference sheets for whatever you're running (just print and cut it to roughly A5 size and you're good!). \n 400.000 SEK We'll make two of these additional GM screen reference sheets and have them printed and included with the screen. Exactly what they'll have on them will be revealed.\n 825.000 SEK We print a minimalistic dungeon crawl in the form of a one-page comic, made by \u0141ukasz Kowalczuk. It will be in A2 format (and also PDF) and comes with the zine. \n 900.000 SEK Pelle will make a generator that will let you generate sects, cults, their leaders and beliefs. This will take up one spread in the zine.\n 1.000.000 SEK, the final stretch goal: We turn the Monster Generator from M\u00d6RK BORG CULT: FERETORY into a digital app, just like we did with scvmbirther and dngngen.  \n\u2716 Of course, if you want to supercharge your pledge with additional things you'll be able to tack on these (more or less) family-friendly products after the Kickstarter campaign ends. These will be shipped together with the MBC: Heretic items. \n\u2716 To buy an addon, click the \"Manage My Pledge\" button and increase your pledge manually with the total cost (in SEK) for all the addons you want. After the Kickstarter ends, there will be a Pledge Manager where you can mark which addons you want for the extra money you put it.\n\u2716 You can also leave your pledge unchanged and add things after the Kickstarter ends.\nNote that addons can incur additional shipping fees as the weight increases, paid for in the pledge manager.\n\nM\u00d6RK BORG CORE BOOK, 250 SEK\n\u2716 The actual game that all this is for. Maybe you want to start your perilous M\u00d6RK BORG journey here and thus need the actual rule book, or something happened to your old copy. Either way, you can get it here! Includes a PDF. \n\n M\u00d6RK BORG CULT: FERETORY, 150 SEK \n\u2716 The previous M\u00d6RK BORG CULT zine, with lots of adventures, monsters, treasures and untimely demise including the mini/solo game Dark Fort which was the original game that later evolved into M\u00d6RK BORG. Includes a PDF. \n\nDEATH TEMPLE SZTUN, 50 SEK\n\u2716 A hyper-linear murder gauntlet of a dungeon crawl. Short (a folded A4 pamphlet, so 6 pages) but sweet (actually not sweet, more bitter and rank). Does not include a PDF.\nCharacter sheet pads, 60 SEK\n\u2716 A pad of character sheets printed on uncoated paper, perfect for writing on or to angrily crumple into a pathetic ball of disappointment. Does not include a PDF but the character sheets are available for free download on morkborg.com so there's no need.\nExtra copy of M\u00d6RK BORG CULT: HERETIC, 150 SEK\n\u2716 Add a second copy of this zine to your pledge. Give it to a friend. Cut it to pieces. Or just keep one close at hand in case something happens. These are weird times. Includes a PDF.\nIKHON, 180 SEK\n\u2716 We don't recommend it, but perhaps you want to obtain this mystical box and have a peek inside. In that case, you can add one to your pledge. Includes a PDF.\nM\u00d6RK BORG GM Screen, 180 SEK\n\u2716 Add a GM screen to your pledge. Includes a PDF. No witty text here, sorry.\n\nShipping\nThese are weird times. Not only because of covid-19 and the uncertainty it brings but also with Brexit screwing international shipping up in unclear ways. Luckily we are able to ship from a Germany-based warehouse and a US-based instead of the UK this time around, but the current situation will, unfortunately, lead to increased shipping costs and possible delays beyond our control. We have done what we can but at the end of the day, some of these things are outside of even our unholy grasp. \n\nShipping will be added in a Pledge Manager after the Kickstarter campaign ends and will be based on the number of products you add to your pledge. But these are the estimates for the pledge levels as they are in this Kickstarter: \nAdditional costs like taxes and/or customs could, but should not, apply.\n\n\u2716 Due to COVID-19 there is a possibility that American backers will receive their stuff a month later than European backers, meaning it might arrive in August. We are doing what we can to avoid this but can't make any promises.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe are experienced in running successful Kickstarter campaigns and to lower the risks on this one, the majority of the stuff we're offering is already done.

As his lodgings become infested with rodents, and his night-time shifts are disturbed by an unearthly spectre, he must reconcile with the future or have his light extinguished forever.'\nWe're so close to making this project a reality, but we need you to help us raise this \u00a38,000 to make it happen! This Kickstarter campaign is all-or-nothing, so we need to raise the whole \u00a38,000 or we won't get a penny. So please help us hit this funding target by pressing the green button and supporting The Leerie.\nTHE WORLD\nA smog-laden Scottish town with a serious rat problem.\nSituated by a heath lit by gas lamps, it\u2019s a dark, lonely place which seems to be perpetually stuck in midwinter. The heath, where the Leerie works, is an isolated, grey place - relentlessly windy, wet and unforgiving.\nIf we raise this Kickstarter funding, we will be able to to use a combination of smart cinematography, and VFX to transform nearly-period exteriors into viable Victorian locations. \nSTYLE\nThe film will be a stylised, experimental horror, influenced by the photographic style of pictorialism. We are shooting on ALEXA XT B+W, in infrared black and white, and the cinematography will draw inspiration from films such as \u2018Through a Glass Darkly\u2019, \u2018Eraserhead\u2019 and \u2018The Lighthouse\u2019. \nThe dialogue is also written in period accurate Scots dialogue in an effort to sustain a link to the Scots poetry of Robert Louis Stevenson and W. D. Cocker, whose poetry about lamplighters inspired the titular character.\nCOSTUME\nEve Oakley's thorough research has led her to come up with some incredible costume designs. Her ability to steer clear of convention is key to her success as a costume designer, she's able to find innovative ways to breathe life into the repetitive period costumes we're used to seeing.\nFrom the Leerie's shoulder having been repeatedly patched up from the wear of his stick, to the Spirit's costume referencing the style of Edwardian glass dresses (a futuristic fashion concept for 1899), we can't wait to see Eve's designs come to life on screen.  \nPRODUCTION\nWe plan to shoot The Leerie in April of this year, but we won't be able to without your help!\nWe've planned a 4 day shoot. 3 days of which will be in our gorgeously rickety interior location, shooting the scenes set in the Leerie's lodgings. We then have a night shoot planned, when we'll shoot the scenes of the Leerie at work lighting the lamps.\nWe have a funder onboard who intends to grant \u00a315k to the budget, only IF we can secure this final \u00a38,000!\nThis film will not go ahead without this funding. So, only with your support, even as little as \u00a35 or \u00a310, we can make this project happen!\nYour money will go towards costs such as costume making, set dressing to make our locations period (i.e. working gas lamps), location expenses, cast and crew fees, kit hire, our original score by composer Hannah McLoughlin, and making sure our set is COVID secure.\nRELEASE\nOur ambition is for The Leerie to be selected for Raindance Film Festival, London Short Film Festival, and Edinburgh International Film Festival, as well as other BAFTA-qualifying British festivals and horror genre festivals. \nOur goal is also to be shortlisted for the Best British Short award at the British Independent Film Awards.\nOUR TEAM\n\nJoseph is a Director from the Black Country.

What place does your character want to live in, or a secret locations, a haunted building full of monsters or a guild hall for warriors to train. It doesn't even need to be a building!\n\nWould you like to enter your own description, add your own ideas? \nReally? Yes! Tell me more...\nFor the Make 100 Challenge this January,  I thought I could ask you, the backer, to submit your ideas to turn into locations, medieval buildings (or.. see below). These I could turn into a map... a massive collaborative city map (and more).\nLike I did in 2019..\nAfter a phenomenal 1000%+ success of the First Make 100 Fantasy Locations, I was asked repeatedly to go again, this time we've decided on a city map (with sewers!)\nFor More information on the first campaign:\nFor scale, my family shows it off:\nAnd in the Image below, that red box\nAn interesting place, with some very interesting quests.. where will your adventurers go next?\n                   In the end, we did 7 maps!\nSo, for this campaign:\nBased on Medieval maps such as this:\nThis Map is one of many that inspired me.\nI thought it would be fun to draw a range of buildings this time. Like this:\nA stock standard Building to be drawn in this town.. could be your characters house!\nYou'll will give me a description of your building, both inside and out, if its just a house of some medieval folk, adventurers, or a shop of some fantastic kind for players in the campaign..\n\nThat's right, a Campaign to go with the map this time:\n\n The Plot. \nZombies? no, not Zombies.. but Spoilers.. you'll have to find out.\nSo the map will be of a city, under siege, in a fantasy setting. There will be a great wall surrounding the city, key buildings such as apothecary, guild halls, forges and fire pits, but also a myriad of city specific buildings needed in a city under siege. i.e. Your Buildings, that will be the mainstay buildings that not only I draw for you, but make interesting place for players to visit.\nOutside the walls will be a plethora of interesting locations for adventurers to loot, haunted houses to burn down and purge from the monsters. But some still standing, strange and exotic buildings to be explored. Some of which I have pre designed, but you contribute your ideas, your buildings, and even your own boss monsters!\nPlease note, the city image used here, is just the plan/layout, buildings will be drawn in an Isometric form for the map, and possible stretch goals are a 2D facia of the building for the Campaign.  \nIf you just want a copy of this campaigns city Map, to help support the campaign.\nContribute your own idea, some character, small critter, maybe a strange sign, or box, a tentacle from an alley, anything that can be drawn on the street between buildings\nThis City Map and all Prior Maps from the first Campaign, All as PDFs\n Haunted Locations\nAs we've hit the Goal, There's a new Tier, the Haunted Location. \nThe Location includes a Monster of your own design, A building of your own design, but now in ruins as the monster controls it, and of course the map, RPG campaign and stretch goals of this project.\nHaunted Buildings, Outside the city walls, many contain inhabitants.. you decide\nThe Main Pledges\nAs per Make 100, there will only be 100 \"main inner city buildings\" drawn into the map for backers, this time split up into two types:\nThe Main Deal, for Make 100, 80 of these & 20 Deluxe (see below)\nBackers will choose what kind of interesting 'different' building they want to appear inside the city walls, places of note, or interest.. though, I don't mind if you WANT a larger building outside the walls.. its your pledge, do as you want!\n\n\nDeluxe Pledge, Choose from the List or Make up your own\nSo many bits, too much text!!\nThe Original Maps\nIf you're a collector, and want the Original, I can be persuaded to let them go at a sum, I've been told is still too cheap. but, its kickstarter, so I'll leave them here at this price, to help boost the project. \nKickstarter has included the new \"Add-ons' as part of their structure, and I've been fortunate enough to be one of the testers. This way, you don't need to figure out which pledge suits you best, just pledge for what you want first and add on some extras as they suit your desires. \n I've done some head scratching, some spreadsheets, and here's what I have so far:\nIn the first project, each backer increased the sheer size of the map, blowing out the time to collate, organize, arrange and then draw. what was 3 months per map, turned into 9 months per map.\nSo the Stretch goals, will be staggered between digital bonuses, roleplay plot bonuses as much as map bonuses. So every three stretch goals will be a new map of 'part' of the city. This way I can draw, edit and write, depending on life's situation and not miss any targets.\nCongrats, You can now add Ruins & Monsters to pledges, and new backers can back the 'Haunted Location' teir\n YaY! We funded, in 2 hours no less, wow, that was great, thanks everyone! \nMore Art, Extra Art, just making it all look good.\nThe Campaign will now include some of your Easter eggs, as redrawn art, plus some backdrops, such as the one in the banner, included in the rulebook. \nYou push back the metal cover, to reveal an entrance.. shall we go down?\n Wow, Past this stretch goal in the first day, I am so grateful for your support.

Also, all Main locations will be drawn in a larger scale for the campaign book, with extra details, maybe including other backers easter eggs that match the theme.\nA stand alone campaign, or making Blood rain even bigger. PDF Booklet & Cover Art\nYou can get the map of the Sewers and run it as its own campaign for any other game, Real estate pledges will get this as a free add-on. Or choose it either as an add-on, or as your pledge.  \nNow for another Map!\nUsing the art from the Larger Scale Buildings, I'll do the inner city as its own player map handout, so GMs can pass one to the players during the campaign, rather than needing to print out a section of the original. All GM icons/secrets will be gone, and titles will be added to places.\nWe managed to hit $5k.. So, I'll spend the months and months that it takes to draw this map.. in COLOUR, after the last colour map, I know I'll need a physio therapist [joke], but It'll be worth it.. \n\nTaking the Lovely Sewer map, I'll be redrawing in Colour, not that your players should be looking at it.. well, let them, after they die horribly and never want to play in this campaign again..  \nLets go Deeper, everyone gets a Dungeon Room and a Monster as Add-ons\nOne half of the city, as a zoomed in Map.\nSouth Half of the city, as a zoomed in map\n\nSocial Goals:\nAll Main buildings in the book, as a Sepia Toned Image\nThis is unlocked, I just forgot to make a graphic\n\nSocial Stretch Goals, 300 backers, I'll be giving out bonus Easter Eggs\n350 Backers, everyone who has some kind of building gets an extra basement/sewer\n 400 Backers, Lets fill out those dungeons with some Monsters.. everyone gets a bonus Monster\n450 Backers, Traps!

I'll then create a web-store to sell the spares, no discount there, full price. RRP$199+\nMore Stretch Goals? \nBeing a Live a developing Kickstart project, I'll respond in the comments, and we can vote on what stretch goals interest you more. \nIf you're creative, backers can add descriptions of their buildings and the interiors, which will be included in both the map PDF and the roleplay rules PDF. Of course, they do need to match the fantasy genre and avoid profanity, and I reserve the right to (collaboratively) change anything that doesn't match. (in a comical way)\nFurther more, I'll add a note box for everyone to participate in the campaign in their own way, if they so wish, adding an NPC or a monster description, an artefact hidden in a house, or a keepsake, found tucked away in a forgotten house. \nJust like in the first project, with social media:\nfacebook, \ndiscord and \ntwitch, \nI'll be hosting live videos as I draw, discussions online and regular weekly reveals.\nThe time to draw each map, can be upwards of 3 months, so I will usually have a monthly live stream. Other users of the map sometimes pop into discussions in discord or twitch to discuss what they've been using the map for, and I've been building up a small back history of the original, so lets hope we can continue this for the city map, adding in your ideas. \nBased on the first project, The Final cost of that project was actually a lot higher than the $250 goal I set for that (albiet that was for a A2 sized map) the costs of paper ($100 for the roll, $25 delivery), scanning large prints x 5 ($20 each test) & test prints x 10($50 for each test), The collection of markers I went through ($100), plus colour markers and copics ($250) for the colour maps, plus the very minimum time it takes to draw out 100 items, I arrived at this more realistic price point. Its set for the Make 100 goal.  As the project grows and people want more, I understand the time to draw will multiply, but I'm more interested in doing the project than raising funds. \n[edit] Because we have funded, and also have unlocked map stretch goals, I'll have to invest in yet another set of copic refils for the sepia and colour maps, yet I'll look into getting higher quality paper, inks and maybe some wax seals to increase and improve the quality of the final maps. \nShipping\nThere are some small add-ons which may require shipping. These will be discussed after the campaign, between you and me, mostly I don't expect a rolled up tube to cost much more than $25, if it does, we'll find a cost effective solution. Likely it'd be cheaper to have it printed in your city & country, and have them post it to you.

So much so that through the years I've built a number of software-based games for the web, mobile devices, and things like the Amazon Alexa (games that people from all over the world have played and hopefully enjoyed). However this is my first attempt at making some of my 'homegrown, offline, games' available to a wider audience (that is to people beyond my small circle of friends and family).\nBecause this is my first attempt at doing something like this, I wanted my offering to be something that was affordable, fun, and accessible to players of all ages and levels -- so I designed everything to fit into one standard poker size tuck box, included as many variations of game play as I could think of (making sure I also had some single player options), and set the price as low as I possibly could.\nI'm excited about what I've come up with! But more than anything, I hope that YOU enjoy these games and that they bring many smiles, and much fun, to you through the years.\nSo what are the games you'll get? Who are they designed for? How long will they take to play? How do you actually win each and what comes included?\nI'm glad you finally asked!\nThe Games:\nEach deck includes 100 total cards and comes with a detailed instruction booklet that outlines the specifics of setup, game play, winning/losing the games, and answers all your questions about any special situations that may come up.\nIn all, there are currently 6 variations of the games you can play with this deck:\n FUBNUB traditional (4 players)\n BAD, BAD, TURTLE traditional (1 to 4 players)\n FUBNUB lucky ghost (1 to 3 players)\n FUBNUB battle royal (2 to 4 players)\n FUBNUB battle royal with lucky ghosts (1 to 4 players)\n FUBNUB full deck (1 to 4 players)\nLet's take a quick, high-level, look at each of the core games (including some pictures of a few prototype cards).\nFUBNUB   \nFubnub cards\n FUBNUB is designed for 1 to 4 players ages 10+. The average play time is about 20 minutes.\nFUBNUB is a strategy based, trick-taking, card game primarily designed for team play. Loosely inspired by the game of Euchre, FUBNUB introduces some unique dealer advantages and a variety of point cards that help to make the game easy to learn, fun to play, and a fresh new challenge with every hand.\nThe winner is the first team to collect 7 of the 15 point cards. \nPoint Cards\n FUBNUB is meant for the slightly more serious card players who are looking for a good game night game for the family or something that could be played with friends in bar (if we're ever able to safely go back to that sort of thing).\nTo play FUBNUB you simply remove the cards marked with the BBT symbol.\nBAD, BAD, TURTLE   \nBad, Bad, Turtle Action Cards\n BAD, BAD, TURTLE is designed for 2 to 4 players ages 5+. The average play time is about 10 minutes.\nBAD, BAD, TURTLE is a quick-paced, easy game that requires you to have more luck than your opponents do. Equally inspired by the card games 'War', 'Uno', and 'Exploding Kittens', BAD, BAD, TURTLE includes a mix of features from each of those games plus a number of its own little wrinkles to make for just the right amount of silly fun in every game.\nThe winner is the player who avoids all the geckos and is the first to find the turtle.\nBAD, BAD, TURTLE is meant for the younger and more casual card player (though I hope players of all ages find it addictively fun too). It's quick, easy, and requires nothing more than a bit of good luck to win.\nTo play BAD, BAD, TURTLE you simply remove the FUBNUB point deck cards.\nThe Rewards:\nThe core reward I am offering in this campaign is the FUBNUB & BAD, BAD, TURTLE set of cards itself. The number of decks you get will depends on the specific reward you choose to back, but this is what a prototype of each card included in every set currently looks like:\nFull Deck of Cards\nNOTE: Some card designs may change or be added to prior to printing (especially if anyone decides to back the 'subtitle a card' reward).\nThe Super fan reward also includes a t-shirt so you can help show off your super fandom.  This is what the shirt will look like:\nSuperfan t-shirt reward\nThe back of the shirt, where your shell would normally be, says \"I shelled out for FUBNUB & BAD, BAD, TURTLE\" (side note: my son calls this \"the most dad joke ever!\", which of course just makes me love it even more)\nThe \"your name in print\" reward will include your name in the thank you section of the instruction booklet that will come with each set. The thank you section will be in the back section of the booklet and your name will be printed in black and white.\nAnd finally, the \"collectors deck\" reward will include a sticker on one of the decks with Kevin's signature (hand written, hopefully legibly, with a sharpie).\nThe card and box details:\nThe cards are standard poker deck size (2.5\" by 3.5\") and will be printed on Blue Core Standard paper stock (280 GSM).  For added playability and quality, they'll include a linen texture.\nEach deck will come packaged in a standard tuck box and include a full color instruction booklet that explains setup and gameplay for each game (and the alternate game play options).\nThe stretch goals:\nAs much as possible, I tried to design the core deck with everything I could think of to make the games fun, quick, and easy to pick up and play. After much research, I choose the printer,  card stock, box type, and instruction book format to be a good balance of affordability and quality.\nAll of that means that, with or without any of these stretch goals, every deck should be packed with good value. But I've also identified a few things that I think will make every deck just a little better...and hopefully a fun number of tasks you can all help me achieve to be able to afford to include them.\nHere's a graphic that breaks it all down (In case you need it, there are text write-ups with more detail below the graphic)\nStretch Goals\nNote: When helping with any achievements please be sure to tag Fubnub in any posts (so we can make sure it gets counted). Here are the details and links for each:\nOn Twitter: @fubnub (you can follow us via https://twitter.com/fubnub)\nOn Facebook: @DigDownLabs (you can follow us via https://www.facebook.com/DigDownLabs)\nOn Instagram: @fubnubandbadbadturtle (you can follow us via https://www.instagram.com/fubnubandbadbadturtle)\nOur Kickstarter campaign link: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/falicon/fubnub-and-bad-bad-turtle (like the map says, you are here!)\nFinally here are some more details on the stretch goal rewards mentioned in the graphic:\nIf we can achieve 2 goals (UNLOCKED!):\nWe'll be able to upgrade from a Blue Core 280 GSM card stock (used for things like Magic: The Gathering and Pok\u00e9mon) to the Black Core 310 GSM (the standard for poker cards because of its high opacity).\nThe material for Black Core 310 GSM is manufactured in Germany and comes pre-textured with a linen texture (the texture adds ridges that reduce surface contact between cards, making them easier to shuffle, deal and handle).\nIf we can achieve 4 goals (UNLOCKED):\nWe'll be able to DOUBLE the number of BAD, BAD, TURTLE action cards that come with every deck. Allowing for slightly longer games and even more chaotic fun with each play!\nIf we can achieve 6 goals (UNLOCKED):\nWe'll be able to introduce at least eight (8) more BAD, BAD, TURTLE action cards into the mix (and you'll get 2x each of them). These action cards will add a number of unique twists and giggles to every game play (if we approach this reward, more details on specific cards that will be included will be released in another update)\nIf we can achieve 8 goals:\nWe'll be able to upgrade from the standard tuck box (what a standard deck of cards comes in) to a two-piece card box (what larger card sets and more traditional games come in).\nIf we can achieve 10 goals:\nWe'll upgrade the card stock to the top of the line card stock - White PVC Luxury with a 0.3mm thickness. The 0.3 mm card thickness makes it possible to shuffle them as you would with regular cards and the material is highly flexible and virtually impossible to rip by hand.\nBecause the PVC card stock isn\u2019t made out of paper, drink spills and food bits will no longer be a problem \u2013 which makes this card a great option for parties and kids. You can even play them in the pool!\nThe deep backstory (a.k.a. the lore):\nNone of what follows is really important to the campaign or the games themselves, but for those of you curious about the complete backstory on the ideas and motivation for this deck...here goes:\nGrowing up in the rural Erie, PA area the small, local bars were often the social hangouts (and during my childhood my father owned one of them, The Sundown in Fairview, PA).\nAnyway, playing various card games was always just one of the things that everyone did at any social gathering. And one of the most popular games to play (especially in the bars) at that time was a game called Euchre.\nFast forward to 2020, and the year of quarantine.\nMy family and I had family game night at least once a week throughout the year. One night, when it was my turn to choose the game, I decided to try and teach them the game of Euchre.\nLong story short - we played it, but none of them loved it (def. teacher error as Euchre is a great game).\nAnyway, around the same time that the 'Marshall Euchre debacle of 2020' occurred, I happened to catch the documentary 'Gamemaster'.\nHaving dabbled with various software based games throughout the years (with some limited success), and really enjoying the family game nights throughout the year, it got me thinking about the idea of creating my own, real world game.\nIt looked like fun, and it felt like something I could do. But what game could I make?\nI had a lot of 'ideas' in the back of my head from various software games I had not gotten around to building (or finishing) yet, but a lot of them felt more complex than I what I was looking for here.\nAs I thought about game ideas, my mind kept wandering back to the troubles I had in explaining Euchre to new players. Maybe there was something I could do to make it easier?\nThat's when the idea for the 'point deck' started to form. And from there, as I started to define the details of it and test play it, an entirely new game started to form. A game that would become the 'traditional' version of FUBNUB.\nOnce I had the core game figure out, I started to think about what else I could do with the deck and the rules. What alternate versions of play could I think of? What if you don't have four players? What if you only have one?\nI started to work through each of those problems, defining the rules, explaining the setup, and of course play testing each option...but I still had one nagging problem.\nEvery version of FUBNUB I came up with was still a bit complex and involved.\nIt probably wasn't going to be a game little kids could play (which is often a good portion of any 'family unit' and I really wanted this to be something for all families).\nIn researching how to get card games printed, I had found a printer that looked promising, and as it turned out b/c of how the cards get printed, the cost to print a deck of 24 cards (all that FUBNUB required) was the same as the cost to print a deck of 54 cards.\nSo I started thinking about what cards I could add to the deck to have an option for younger players...and that's where the general idea of BAD, BAD, TURTLE started to form.\nTo be honest, in my head it was orig. thought up as Bad, bad, kitty. But IMHO cats are overused right now, so I was going to make it Bad, bad, puppy. However, when I dug into my artwork source, I didn't find any puppy artwork I liked.\nInstead, I found a really cute Turtle (and once I saw that, I immediately fell in love with the title BAD, BAD, TURTLE -- a bad turtle is more fun to think about than a bad kitty or puppy any day, and it's more fun to say too).\nFrom there it was just a matter of thinking up some 'action cards' that would be easy, fun, and ideally a little unique. What I came up with is what you see described above.\nSo there you have it - All the lore behind FUBNUB & BAD, BAD, TURTLE.\nIf you actually read through all of that, wow, thank you! I hope it excites you enough to back the project, and I hope the project delights you enough to share with friends & family.\nBut most of all, with or without these games, I hope you have many fun family game nights ahead too!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is my first attempt at printing up a deck of cards -- so there will be a number of potential challenges.\n\nI've identified a printer that comes highly recommended and has a good history of delivering a high-quality product on time and within budget...but, especially in the current world-climate, there is always a risk that it will take longer to print and ship than I initially expect (I do have a slightly more expensive printer identified that I can fall back to if any significant delays or challenges occur).\n\nBecause this is also my first kickstarter experience, and I wanted to make things as simple as possible, I'm including shipping in the price for all U.S. locations and only adding $2 to help cover any international shipping.

So, let the Peeved Paisleys do it for you.\nThe design of this bandana features oodles of paisleys who are clearly peeved, aggravated, and irked. \nA seemingly serene symmetrical design contains plenty of peeveded paisleys.\nLike my previous BADbandanas, I\u2019m going to reproduce this drawing as a 21-inch square bandana. With white paisleys on a dignified gray background, these bandanas will be 100 percent cotton printed right here in the good-old USA using duplex printing like the quality bandanas I grew up with. (Dyed\u2014not that obnoxious silkscreening we all hate.)\nWhat do you get? Each bandana contains a couple dozen annoyed paisleys combined in a serenely symmetrical composition that is an homage to the classic bandanas of the past.\nPackage of three. (Makes a great gift.)\nPacked in sets of three so you\u2019ll have spares for gift giving. Bandanas make convenient masks to discourage inconvenient viruses and they have many uses in fashion, personal hygiene, and pet decoration. No one is going to want just one. So I\u2019m offering reward levels of BADbandanas in packs of three.\n\nDon says, \u201cI love traditional bandanas but they need more pizzazz. I doubt you have any bandanas in your drawer quite like this\u2014peeved paisleys!\u201d \nBADbandanas make superb gifts. Even if you aren\u2019t a big fan of bandanas, you may want to get a bunch to share. Great gifts for friends, family, neighbors who are angry, annoyed, or vexed.\nDo you need a reminder of how you can use your BADbandanas?\nDon and dog model BADbandana uses. (Don\u2019s the one wearing glasses.)\n\nWhat the critics are saying...\n \u201cA perfect expression of my current mood. This design is ideal for these troubled times.\u201d \n\u201cOne can never have too many clean bandanas.\u201d\n \u201cExcellent gift for friends\u2014especially those who are miffed...and who isn\u2019t?\u201d \n \u201cIs that pizza sauce on your chin? No problem. Mop it up with your BADbandana.\u201d\n \u201cA perfect blend of silly and practical. An enhancement to any wardrobe.\u201d \n\nSCHEDULE\nLightning fast. If there are no calamities, you should have your BADbandanas by April, 2021. Perhaps sooner. Sponsors of this project will receive periodic updates through Kickstarter as the project unfolds.\nSHIPPING\nJust the local neighborhood. Because shipping is extra slow and troublesome these days, we are limiting rewards to residents of the U.S. and Canada only. Later, some extras of these BADbandanas will be available at our online store. So, anyone excluded from the Kickstarter project will be able to get Peeved Paisleys there.\nTracking. You will receive a tracking number when we ship, so track your package daily to make sure it doesn\u2019t get hung up in the system and returned to us. Don\u2019t just assume it will show up at your door. Shipments have a way of getting stalled, and monitoring the status of the tracking number allows you to intervene promptly.\nCustoms. Sometimes, but not always, shipments to Canada get hit with customs duties. I have no way of predicting if they\u2019ll apply to your shipment. Customs inspections are very arbitrary and willy-nilly. Most packages sail through without any duty, but some are selected seemingly by chance and the recipient gets hit with a duty fee. So if you can\u2019t tolerate the risk that your shipment might get selected for extra costs, you should probably not support this project. Or arrange to have your reward shipped to a friend in the U.S. who can bring your Peeved Paisleys during their next trip.\nShipping is provided by our capable and multi-talented partners at Fulfillrite. Our Fulfillrite friends are fast and they do things right the first time.\nWhere are you? When the rewards are ready to ship, we\u2019ll send out a Kickstarter address survey. If you don\u2019t respond to that survey within 6 months, we\u2019ll assume you no longer want your reward. I don\u2019t have the space to hold your reward in perpetuity or until the cows come home.\n\nLOOSE ENDS\nUpdates and progress reports. Sponsors of this project will receive periodic updates through Kickstarter as the project unfolds but not so often that you think I\u2019m an obnoxious pest.\nQuestions? Send me your questions and I\u2019ll add them and the answers to the FAQ section at the bottom of this page.\nThanks for your amazing support.\nLeftovers from my previous Kickstarter projects are available while supplies last at www.calamityware.com. Not only is this a good place to find some unusual gifts, but it is the only place you\u2019ll find the world\u2019s greatest shower curtain.\nDon\u2014Pittsburgh, January 6, 2021", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe basic techniques of making bandanas are centuries old.

Panic seizes top players, equipment companies and the tennis authorities.  \nControversy swells to a crescendo; the future of tennis itself is at stake... \nWith a colourful cast mixing offbeat unknowns and legends like Ilie Nastase and John McEnroe, this is a quixotic tale of dreams, triumph and disaster in the golden era of tennis.\n\nTHE HISTORY  \nIn 1977, tennis was entering the golden age of Borg, Connors and McEnroe. During the summer, the International Tennis Federation (ITF) began receiving reports about a mysterious new force on the circuit. Major tournaments were complaining of upsets, with seeds losing to lowly-ranked players using a strange double-strung system on their rackets.\nAt the US Open, Mike Fishbach, \"an amply-bearded refugee from the satellite circuit\", pulled off the biggest shock of the tournament. Using a racket double-strung with gut, fishing line, tape and twine, Fishbach trounced top player Stan Smith.\nMichael Fishbach\nBack in the halcyon days of \u201877, there were no restrictions on racket design. That same year, the US Tennis Association President, Slew Hester had asserted you could play \u201c...with a tomato can on a broomstick, if you think you can win with it.\u201d  But the authorities soon revealed a more draconian side in response to the Spaghetti racket threat.\nWerner Fischer\nThe origins of the crisis went back to 1971, when Werner Fischer, a gardener from the hamlet of Vilsbiburg in Germany invented a new stringing system. With its intricate, double-strung weave and unique mix of special cements and nylon tubes, the \u201cSpaghetti\u201d racket produced unexpected spin and bounce.\nSoon, the local tennis team, which had until then languished in the lower divisions of the German League, began to win matches. By 1977, the obscure part-timers had achieved an unprecedented four successive promotions. They had risen, against all the odds, to the pinnacle of German tennis - the Bundesliga. \nThe 1977 Vilsbiburg Team\nNews of Fischer's invention and its success quickly spread. Following Mike Fishbach's run at the 1977 US Open, there was an explosion of interest on the professional tour.  \nAt the Paris Open, the following week, George Goven, another Spaghetti racket devotee, dumped tennis great Ilie Nastase out of the tournament. \nIncensed, Nastase called on the ITF to ban the racket, declaring that from now on, he would refuse to play against anyone using one. Yet, at the next tournament in Aix-en-Provence, in typical Nastase-fashion, the mischievous Romanian arrived, armed with his own set of Spaghetti Rackets.\nThe tournament at Aix was a wake-up call for the ITF.  Three of the semi-finalist, including  Nastase, were using the Spaghetti racket, with only World No. 1 Guillermo Vilas keeping faith with the traditional racket. \nIn the final, Vilas, who was unplayable that year, and was on a record unbeaten run of 53 matches on clay and 46 on all surfaces, faced Nastase. \nIlie Nastase and Guillermo Vilas\nBilled as the old racket versus the new racket, the final turned out to be a one-sided affair. \nFinding no answers to the power and accuracy of a Spaghetti racket-wielding Nastase, Vilas abandoned the match, and walked off court in disgust.\nThe Spaghetti racket had finally come of age, but not for long... \nThe ITF made a crushing response. For the first time in seven centuries, the laws of tennis were changed to define \u201c the tennis racket\u201d.\nThe new rule was carefully drafted to outlaw the Spaghetti racket and only the Spaghetti racket. The ITF didn't ban another contemporary innovation, one that was being promoted by someone with considerably more contacts, cash and clout than a Bavarian gardener. \nHoward Head\nAfter making his fortune pioneering laminated skis, Howard Head retired at the end of the 60\u2019s and took up tennis. He spent $5,000 on lessons but was so inept that his local pro soon refused to teach him. Undettered, Head simply decided to build a new racket. In \u201874, after a dozen unsuccessful prototypes, Head woke up from a dream with a 'Eureka' flash of genius telling him to \u201cmake it bigger\u201d.\n Head's new \u201cPrince\u201d racket was lighter than its wooden forerunners, easier to swing, boasted a larger sweet spot and greater power. Unlike Fischer's racket, which was difficult to master, the Prince was a 'cheat', a racket which made the sport easier to play. It promised to popularize tennis and was hugely attractive to big business.\nThere was widespread criticism that the Prince racket would adversely affect the sport, but the ITF allowed it, whilst outlawing the Spaghetti. This was despite the Spaghetti racket being merely a clever re-configuration of the stringing surface, compared to Howard Head's top-down redesign of the racket itself.\nWhile Head\u2019s racket took over tournament play, starting with Pam Shriver reaching the US Open final in 1978, the ITF moved to end Fischer\u2019s hopes.\nDuring a court case in Omaha, technical demonstrations and player testimony were used to prove that Spaghetti stringing spoiled the \u2018character\u2019 of tennis. Meanwhile Head, a businessman of genius and a regular on popular TV talk shows, played the system for all it was worth.\n\nTHE SPAGHETTI RACKET tells this David-and- Goliath tale with humour and nostalgia, through the remarkable personalities involved and memorable actuality from that golden age of tennis. Through the central story, we illuminate wider issues such as the relationship between technology and sport. We also address controversial questions: Why was one invention judged more dangerous to the sport than the other? Was it simple economics, or were other forces at play...? And how has the outcome affected tennis today? \nSince the Prince appeared, racket technology has irrevocably changed the sport. John McEnroe and other  former players have often lamented how tennis is now dominated by power unimaginable in previous eras.\nMeanwhile, it was McEnroe who played the last ever match at Wimbledon with a \u201cnormal-sized\u201d wooden racket in 1982. Oversized composite rackets began to roll off the production line in their millions, and Werner Fischer went back to tending his plants.\nOUR STORY\nContemplating how to get the project over the finish line and promoting it at Wimbledon\nI had a vague memory of the the Spaghetti Racket as a tennis-obsessed child growing up in 1970s Iran. \nOne minute there was news of this invincible, Excalibur-like racket toppling top seeds at tournaments and then nothing. It was as if it had disappeared off the face of the earth. \nAfter visiting the Wimbledon Museum and seeing the racket in the flesh for the first time, my interest was piqued. \nI wrote a treatment and shopped the project around, but at the time no one was interested, few even believed the story to be true. \nBy this time, the story had well and truly gotten under my skin. I persuaded my brother and an old school-friend to help me make the film. \nIt took us two years to track down the inventor, Werner Fischer and another six months to persuade him to trust us to tell his story. \nWhat finally clinched the deal was me  promising to have a finished film within the year.\nWhat I hadn't factored in was the cost of the archive. Sports archive is staggeringly expensive. As a consequence, the film has been a state of semi-finished limbo for the past four years. \nDuring this time we've had interest from the BBC among others, but the cost of the archive has always been a stumbling block.\nDuring lockdown, I persuaded Mr Fischer that we should take our project to the internet. Perhaps with a lot of luck and a little strategy, we could reach out to the global tennis community and rally them around this forgotten yet colorful slice of tennis history. \nWerner Fischer\nEXTERNAL LINKS\nhttps://www.theracketsurgery.com/blog/11-spaghetti-stringing-part-1 \n https://www.theracketsurgery.com/blog/12-spaghetti-stringing-part-2 \n https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0lJOd6Z6e0 ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe money we are asking for will go towards paying for the archive and finishing post-production.

These last years I carried out several interventions in public space in Heraklio, Athens, Paris, New-York. \n https://www.linardaki-parisot.com/the-sleeping-project \nWhether large murals or more discreet interventions, it is always about to melt in the environment but also to surprise the passers-by, make them doubt and modify their eyes on their place of life.\nMy project is to paint a mural on one of the walls of the natural history museum of Crete (Greece) facing the sea.\nAnd also create a series of visual art workshops with children and adolescents around this project.\nwall of the natural history museum of Crete Heraklion (Greece) facing the sea.\nthe wall is 5 meter high.\nwallpainting project\n\nABOUT THE WALLPAINTING\nMy painting project for the museum is called the colossus.\nThe idea comes from several sources.\nThe use of the animal (the monkey) which is connected with the natural history museum.\nIt is a monkey made of gray faux marble that is found in Crete.\nHe is standing with both feet on an amphora so we can see him from far \nlike the colossus.\nThe position of the right hand carried over the eyes of the monkey comes from a bronze Minoan statuette which represents an Adorant of a type frozen \u201cstanding attention\u201d garde a vous, to protect them from the divine glare, it is said.\nOr to protect is eyes from the sun as I thought\n\nthe colossus, Vincent Parisot\nThis painting is also part of a series called \u03bc\u03ac\u03c1\u03bc\u03b1\u03c1\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03ca\u03bc\u03bf\u03cd.\nIt\u2019s s series of drawings and paintings called Marmaromaimou (marble monkey)\nI draw faux marble forms and effects in the shape of monkeys. The drawings will be installed in the manner of a fresco thus creating different scenes. The idea of this project comes from the observation of the frescoes of the archaeological museum of Heraklion in Crete where I was in residence. The word Maimou (monkey) in Greek is used to say that something is a imitation that I find interesting in co-relation with my faux marble technique.\n\nWHY IS THIS IMPORTANT ?\nI may not be an essential workers, but I am a cultural worker.\nCulture is important it connects people and it's a tool for change.\nAs an artist it is also my responsibility to be part of the community.\nWe must now act local to think global, the ecological crisis pushes us there.\n\nThe natural history museum has been seriously impacted by the pandemic crisis.\nIt's a part of my daily life, it is next to the Agia Triada district where I live. My children went there regularly with their school and during the holidays to do workshops. The museum plays a key role in the city, it is not only a place to discover the history of nature but also it has a strong cultural and social impact.\n\nMy goal is not to create a decor but to realize an on-site project made especially for the museum with different local references. My contribution is a way to highlight this place and create a dialogue with the neighborhood.\n\nABOUT THE MUSEUM\nThe main concern of the Natural History Museum of Crete - University of Crete (UoC-NHMC) is to broaden the visitor experience of the museum. Young scientists (biologists, foresters, farmers, ecologists and geologists among others) are always present in the museum to answer visitors' questions.\nIn recent years, the Museum has redefined its vocation as a meeting place between science and culture. In this context, it dares to experiment its activities in response to the challenges of modern society by achieving the demanding balance between heritage and innovation.\nthe museum\nHOW YOU CAN HELP THE PROJECT\nFor me to carry out the project I would need 600 euros.\nThe museum cannot help me financially but they can give me technical help and scaffolding.\nI ask you to participate in the painting budget\nI need to use good quality paint and resin based products because the wall is near the sea. This requires more coating and therefore more work.\nAnother part of this budget will be devoted to a series of workshops with children and adolescents. There are two huge banners at the entrance of the museum, the idea is to draw with the children all the footprints of the animals in the museum and then paint them on the banners, using stencils, thus referring to the origin of art.\nTHANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT\nsunburn, le coup du soleil, chalk, Lisses, France, 2016, Vincent Parisot\nWHEN\nThe wall painting in early April 2021 when it doesn't rain anymore\nand workshops after the situation returns to normal.\n\nTHE REWARDS\n \u20ac15 - \u03bc\u03ac\u03c1\u03bc\u03b1\u03c1\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03ca\u03bc\u03bf\u03cd / 2020 / Digital print / A4 / Vincent Parisot.\n\n\u20ac15 - \u03bc\u03ac\u03c1\u03bc\u03b1\u03c1\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03ca\u03bc\u03bf\u03cd / 2020 / Digital print / A4 / Vincent Parisot.\n\u20ac15 - \u03bc\u03ac\u03c1\u03bc\u03b1\u03c1\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03ca\u03bc\u03bf\u03cd / 2020 / Digital print / A4 / Vincent Parisot.\n\n \u20ac25 - Blind sunrise / 2016 / Digital print / A3 / Vincent Parisot.\n\n \u20ac50 - I cried a river over you / 2020 / Digital print / A3 / Linardaki - Parisot. \n\n \u20ac50 - Borderligne / 2016 / Digital print / A3 / Vincent Parisot.\n\u20ac300 - the kiss / 2020 / acrylic paint on paper / 42x60cm / Vincent Parisot .", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI am confident that the wallpainting will proceed smoothly and that if my fundraiser is successful,\nI will be able to paint the wall in April 2021, because it is not subject to COVID-19 regulations.\n\nHowever, given the current situation, there might be delays in producing and/or shipping photos and painting, as unexpected lockdowns.\n\nFor the workshops with children and adolescents it will be possible only after the situation returns to normal.\n\nTHANKS A LOT \nvincent\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u20ac15 or more", "title": "\u03bc\u03ac\u03c1\u03bc\u03b1\u03c1\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03ca\u03bc\u03bf\u03cd / 2020 /", "descp": "digital print / A4", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Apr 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["6 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac25 or more", "title": "Blind sunrise / 2016 /", "descp": "Digital print / A3", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Apr 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["4 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac50 or more", "title": "I cried a river over you / 2020 /", "descp": "Digital print / A3", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Apr 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["3 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac50 or more", "title": "Borderligne / 2016 /", "descp": "Digital print / A3", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Apr 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["1 backer"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac300 or more", "title": "the kiss / 2020 /", "descp": "Acrylic paint on paper", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Apr 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["1 backer", "Limited (1 left of 2)"]}], "updates": [{"status": [{"Project funds successfully": "31 backers pledged \u20ac1,438"}, {"Project launches": "DECEMBER 19, 2020"}]}], "comment_no": 0, "projec_url": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/vincent75/the-colossus", "project_name": "The colossus"}}, {"backer": "Tieg Zaharia", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "More than three years ago, Hex & Company opened our doors on the Upper West Side as Manhattan's largest board game cafe. We've since held thousands of D&D and Magic: The Gathering games, hosted uncountable date nights and parties, and served tens of thousands of drinks!\nThen the pandemic hit, and our mission became incredibly challenging. But we're hitting back even harder, gladly sending off 2020- and preparing for 2021 to be our biggest year yet. We're moving into a new location a couple of blocks north, doubling in size, and creating a flagship community space that will be able to host over 200 people. \nFor a $10 seating fee, you have access to our library of games- more than a thousand. It's also a place where you can eat, drink, and buy your favorite titles.\nA Piece of History. We're moving into 2911 Broadway- the former home of the West End Bar, dating back to 1911! It served as the base for the Beat Poets, and is \"where Columbia had its first beer\".\nLGBTQ- and Family-Friendly. Our place has always been a safe space for everyone! In addition to keeping a large number of family-oriented games in our library, we also offer family and kids-only programming. We'll be continuing our wildly successful after-school and summer camp programs, and even expanding them in light of all the new space.\nEven More Events. We're bringing our existing Magic: The Gathering and tabletop RPG communities up north too! Plus, we're adding private areas, multiple TVs for the best tournament experience in the area, and expanded A/V capabilities too. The West End was a longtime home for jazz and live music, and we're hoping to expand on that legacy by adding a stage and supporting the arts in a way we haven't been able to before. \nBetter Food. We\u2019re REALLY excited about our new kitchen- and expanding our menu. We\u2019re working with an experienced team who will focus solely on food, bringing together proven menu concepts from around the world (literally).\nGreat Drinks. We're proud to support local favorites Brooklyn Roasting Company coffee/espresso and Harney & Sons tea. Beer and cider enthusiasts have always found a home at our current location and we'll now have twelve draft lines to work with. Plus, we're adding a cocktail menu and milkshakes-  they've been super-successful at our East side location, which opened last year with a little help from a Kickstarter project then.\nWe're a small local business, and every dime donated goes straight into finishing our space! Our new Upper West Side venue is happening no matter what, but we're hoping to add amenities including private rooms- and even a stage to support arts and connect with The West End's history as a jazz venue.

J.R.R. and Edith Tolkien moved into 20 Northmoor Road with their young family in 1930. Over the next 17 crucial years the house was the heart of the Tolkien home. It was here that J.R.R. Tolkien wrote The Hobbit, which he had begun as a bedtime story for his children, and followed that with another unexpected journey. That book became The Lord of the Rings.\nWe set up the not-for-profit Project Northmoor to achieve this. A significant part of the capital has already been raised but we need a new push to achieve our target. If the house is secured for Tolkien fans, it will be renovated so that the guest can experience what it would have been like to call on the Professor in 1940.  \nJ R R Tolkien\nUpstairs the bedrooms would reflect the cultures he invented and the garden would be restored to a beauty of which the inventor of Sam Gamgee would be proud.\nYou would then be able to be a guest at the Centre by booking into its programme of writing seminars and other cultural events, or join in virtually with the online programme.The creative courses will focus will be on inspiring a new generation of fantasy writers, film makers and artists. Other courses will introduce visitors to Tolkien and his circle, including visiting the places that inspired him.\n Following in Tolkien\u2019s footsteps: creative writing in Oxford: A 5-day program in Oxford will consist of daily sessions with a tutor, ample hobbit-sized breakfasts (and second breakfasts!), walks in places that inspired Tolkien, evenings in the pub, and a group discussion for everyone who would like to share their work.\nIn future years, we will add similar courses for filmmakers and illustrators.\nOxford\n Walking and writing in the Shire: This course can be booked as a 3-day extension to the creative writing course or as a separate course for those with a general interest in Tolkien. They are aimed at those who want to travel further afield in England to see the places that inspired J.R.R. Tolkien. The participants will spend the day with a tour guide, exploring important places or landscapes that inspired Tolkien.\n3000 year-old White Horse\nOtmoor - home to Father Giles of Ham\nWarwick Castle\n Fantasy Writers Course Online: An online fantasy writers\u2019 creative writing course with published authors as your tutors. You would receive one-to-one tutorials, talks on plotting, character, pacing, dialogue and other elements of writing, and join in our seminars and socials.\nYou can find out more details, including provisional dates for these courses already. Just go here and register your interest today! Due to the pandemic, the online course is likely to happen first but we are hoping in-person courses can begin in the summer.\n\nYou will also be able to book to stay in the house for B&B when the bedrooms are not used for courses. Come and enjoy the beautiful city of Oxford and spend time in Tolkien's study, contemplating the garden in which he spent so much time.\nThe house\nThe house has seven bedrooms already, including one with disabled access. The floor plan is unchanged since Tolkien's time. It is perfect for small groups to stay. Downstairs, Tolkien's study is the largest room, stretching the width of the house, and would provide an inspiring teaching space, just as he used to welcome students at home.\nUpstairs at 20 Northmoor\nThe house will be financially self-sustaining once purchased, thanks to income from visitors. There will also be special events in the house and talks for guests about Tolkien and his circle.\n\nThe team behind the initiative are volunteers from the UK, US, Canada and South Africa. Leading the project is multi-award-winning author and Tolkien fan, Julia Golding. She has written over 60 novels for all ages in many different genres. You can find out more about her here. Her love for Tolkien began with reading The Lord of the Rings when she was ten and she hasn't stop since. \nShe is assisted on Joss Saunders, one of the UK's leading charity lawyers. His grandfather was a friend of Tolkien, as well as his squash partner, when they were young academics at Leeds University in the 1920s. As a result, Tolkien's books were family favourites from the date of first publication.\nLeading the way in North America, is Brian Boyd, who has 30+ years experience in marketing.\nAnd in Canada, we have Kevin Harwood, digital marketing expert and experienced user of Kickstarter on other projects.\nSo please join the Fellowship of Funders today.\n\nJoin the Fellowship of Funders\n Rewards\nHere's a little taste of some of the rewards you can claim, going from a few pounds to a few thousand!  If you are interested in a bigger involvement which could bring rewards such as naming rights to rooms or the centre itself, please go to www.projectnorthmoor.org/rewards\nIf you pick a stay in the house, please note most rooms are doubles so the pledge can cover a couple or two single friends willing to share. Please note, a warden will also be living in the house so will act as your host in all stay-overs.\n You can also add some of these as add-ons to your pledge, but if you wish to pick a physical product (such as the bookmark) after a digital reward (such as the tour), please increase your pledge and let us know in a message that is what it is for because the Kickstarter add-on system does not yet let you add a physical to digital reward.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe biggest risk is that someone else will buy it before we can raise the money.

A Shinto priestess, Hiroko, guides us through this unique philosophy, which is based on gratitude and connection to the kami - the energy of nature.\n      Kami are manifestations of the interconnecting energy of the universe. Usually hidden from this world, they inhabit a complementary existence that mirrors our own. Sometimes we can feel them in the elements of landscape or forces of nature. When you reach a harmony with awe-inspiring aspects of nature, then you are conscious of the way of the kami.\nPROTAGONIST\n      Hiroko Takayama is a priestess at the Dazaifu Tenmangu - a shrine dedicated to the kami of learning, culture and arts. \n      Hiroko was an IBM employee for 10 years. Only when she became a priestess, did she start to truly appreciate the nature surrounding her. Now she frequently goes on trips to the mountains surrounding Fukuoka, the city she lives in.\nDIRECTOR'S STATEMENT\n      From an early age, I was fascinated by Japanese culture and pop-culture. During my last two visits to Japan (in 2010 and 2017), I noticed that their native philosophy, Shinto, has influence over nearly every aspect of the country, from culture to everyday life. I would like to create a film about that philosophy. A philosophy which has such an amazing influence on life in a country that interests me.\n      I have always liked spending time in natural environments. However, only when I started filming this project, did I realise that there may be some deeper connection between us and nature. The connection which is being gradually lost in an evermore industrialized world. This connection became even more apparent to me - and I believe to all of us - during these days of the pandemic. \n      We're almost done! Then along came the coronavirus. Please help us cross the finish line and release this film!\nBENEFITS OF WATCHING THIS FILM\n      You, just like me, may begin to realize that there is more to nature than meets the eye. Thanks to this film, when lockdown ends you may be better equipped to start experiencing the wonders of nature again. As for now, you can experience the beautiful and exotic nature of Japan through our film.\nWHY IS THIS FILM PROJECT UNIQUE?\nShinto has been largely inaccessible to documentary filmmakers - until now. \nOur guide in the film is a Shinto priestess, Hiroko. For a woman to be a Shinto priestess is an extremely rare profession.\nWe document the transition from Heisei to Reiwa period. This transition was marked by a private Shinto ceremony attended by only about 10 priests and our film crew.\nThe film will try to convey the meaning of Shinto through images and sounds. There are very few scenes with dialogue. \nThis is a documentary film, but it is shot with cinematic-quality images, 4K resolution and high-end camera.\nFILMING LOCATIONS\nThis project was filmed in and around the city of Fukuoka in Japan. The three main locations were:\nDazaifu Tenmangu shrine: https://www.dazaifutenmangu.or.jp/en/ \nHakozaki Shrine: https://www.hakozakigu.or.jp/ \nShikaumi Shrine: http://www.shikaumi-jinja.jp/ \nPROJECT COMPLETION STATUS & WHY KICKSTARTER\nWe finished filming in Japan in 2019. (All the stills used on this page are from the material we shot then.)\nCurrently we are at a stage of editing the film.\nWe financed filming in Japan and part of the postproduction process.

It's 50 years later, I've had Oscar nominations and won Cannes Festival awards, and it's time to fulfill a boyhood dream.\nThree years ago, I wrote out a storyboard about a slide guitar-playing cowboy named Slide who appears in a corrupt logging town (circa 1940's) to battle a pair of evil twins and save the village of Sourdough Creek.\nSLIDE has villains, an old-time country music cowboy band, the Lucky Buck Saloon and Bordello, and a glorious Oregon backdrop (And it features a hero who, like me, plays the slide guitar.)\nBy raising our $77,800 minimum goal here on Kickstarter my team and I will be able to devote most of the next six months to SLIDE, with a completion date in 2022.\nBut I want to get SLIDE to you sooner.\nWe have a very ambitious $200,000 \"stretch\" goal that would allow us to complete SLIDE by this time next year - and wouldn't it be great to have a new animated film ready for our safe return to theaters!\nI think you're going to love the rewards: Attend the New York City premiere of SLIDE; Take a private animation class with me, either via Zoom or (after the pandemic) in my NYC studio; And ALL backers at the $100 level or higher will see their name in the closing credits!\nI'm also drawing the caricature of at least one backer who will get to play a Old West villain, have a speaking role, see their name in the closing credits, AND get an IMDb credit.\nBest of all, on Dec. 18, 2020 we're sending out a survey to all of our backers, giving you the option of gifting one of our rewards in time for the holidays. We'll email a gift certificate for the reward you select to the recipient you designate.\nOne of the cool advantages of going to Kickstarter now, halfway through the production, is that we have a lot of clips and sequences to share.  Follow me on Facebook daily during the campaign as I do a drawing a day on camera so you can see how I create my characters and animation.\nPeople call me the \"King of Indie Animation\" and I hope to capitalize on that moniker to give people an inside look at how I create my films - from the concept to the editing and music.  \nThanks for supporting independent animation, and a sincere thanks for supporting me and my new film SLIDE with your generous pledge.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs an independent filmmaker, being self-financed is a risk all by itself. I animate a few commercial projects each year, recently a few cool music videos and an nearly-annual \"couch gag\" for the opening of \"The Simpsons\" on FOX-TV. And the income from those projects is very helpful in keeping my studio running - but it only gets me about halfway there if I want to keep creating my own animated shorts and features. Some advance theatrical distribution money from France also helps, but I've used Kickstarter to help fill the gap. My fans have helped with the production of two features, \"Cheatin'\" and \"Revengeance\", and a series of political shorts called \"Trump Bites\". My hardcore fans have bought their DVD or streaming copies in advance, which gets me the money early to finish animating the film faster, I don't have to wait for another big commercial project to come in and fund the feature.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "Insider Sneak Peeks", "descp": "Follow Bill through the making of SLIDE with exclusive updates, stills and animated clips available only to Kickstarter backers.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Feb 2021"}], "stat": ["51 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 25 or more", "title": "Stream SLIDE at Home", "descp": "We'll send you a private link to stream SLIDE once it completes its theatrical premiere and/or Oscar qualification PLUS sneak peeks into the making of SLIDE.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2022"}], "stat": ["112 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 50 or more", "title": "Autographed DVD of SLIDE", "descp": "You\u2019ll receive a limited edition DVD of \"Slide\", hand-signed by Bill Plympton, and mailed to your home after the film\u2019s theatrical run and Oscar-qualification process.

But a small group of fanatic hologram hackers did believe, and we were able to ship them thousands of our first generation holographic dev kits. To us, holographic displays weren't just a dream from sci-fi movies \u2014 they were something real that we used every day.\nAnd yet, we've always wanted a way for everyone to have their own holographic display. That's why today we're so excited to share something we've been working on in secret for the past 18 months: the Looking Glass Portrait \u2014 your first personal holographic display.\nYou don't need to know how to program to use this holographic display. Looking Glass Portrait is designed for the millions of people that work or play in 3D in any way: Artists, Designers, Developers, Filmmakers, Photographers, and those of you who are just starting to explore three-dimensional capture and creation. Even phones can now capture holograms*.\nSo if your curiosity led to you to this page and you're wondering if you're the type of person that could own their own personal holographic display....the answer is yes. Find out everything you can do with this new magical invention in the scroll below. And welcome to the future!\nMinimum Requirements for Desktop Mode\n HoloPlay Studio works with PC and Mac. \nTo import, edit, process and convert depth photos, videos, and other holographic media, almost all PCs and Macs with HDMI and USB-C will work. Post a question in the Comments section if you have any questions about this. \nTo run and create heavier-duty interactive applications with Unity or Unreal, we recommend a PC with a GTX 1650 or equivalent, CPU with Intel i5 or higher, and at least 8GB of RAM. \nMinimum Requirements for playback in Standalone Mode\nYour imagination (also, USB-C or wall power).\n Phones can now capture holograms*.\nThe easiest way to make a hologram is to take a Portrait mode photo with your phone.\nBelieve it or not, those Portrait mode photos you've been taking have depth information hidden behind them. This is normally used to generate bokeh effect, and now the software that comes with every Looking Glass Portrait can use that same depth info to generate a three-dimensional hologram with a single click.\nThe new iPhone 12 Pro using a combination of advanced machine learning techniques and LiDAR capabilities can capture the best depth photos yet with a single shot.\n* These iPhone models support Portrait mode: iPhone 12, iPhone 12 mini, iPhone 12 Pro, iPhone 12 Pro Max, iPhone SE (2nd generation), iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro, iPhone 11 Pro Max, iPhone XR, iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max, iPhone X, iPhone 8 Plus, and iPhone 7 Plus. Some brand-name Android phones also support depth capture with portrait mode photos. The newer the phone, generally, the better the depth map.  \n\nOn January 6, 2021, we announced support for a number of flagship Android phones as well as a new conversion service that can take any 2D image and convert than into a 3D hologram for Looking Glass Portrait. Read this update.\n\nHere's a running list of all the compatible Android phones that will work directly with HoloPlay Studio: \nMost of the newer flagship Samsung phones, including A7, A9, S10, S10e, S9+, S20, S20+, S20 Ultra.\nSome of the Huawei phones with \"Aperture\" mode, including Mate 20, Mate 20 Lite, Mate 20 Pro, P20 Pro, P30 Pro.\nNewer Pixel phones, including the Pixel 3, 4, and 5 models.\nFor a more updated list, head on over here. \nUse any camera to capture super-realistic holograms.\nIf you're looking to push the limits of holographic capture even further, Looking Glass Portrait can also display light field photos. This is a fancy term for a series of images taken from different perspectives. You can now capture these advanced three-dimensional photographs with conventional panning shot techniques using the camera you already own and display them in Looking Glass Portrait. \nThis is a simple 4K panning video. It has everything needed for a super-realistic holographic \"light field\" photograph.\nBecause this method captures and displays not only depth but also the directionality of millions of rays of light. even objects like a magnifying lens work in the resulting hologram like a real magnifying lens would.\n*Compatibility: Works with any camera (including phones), that can record 4K video.\nFor this advanced capture technique, you can use your own rail, stabilized camera, or use the rail included in the Holographic Capture Bundle.\nSequence by Giovanni Remigi, a 3D artist and the developer of Lentigram, an interlacing software package for the production of high quality three-dimensional photographs.\nSalmon Tartine by Alban (Sketchfab)\nFlower Point Cloud Photogrammetry by Moshe Caine (Sketchfab)\nTransform photogrammetry and LiDAR scans into holograms.\nPhotogrammetry-based 3D scans and the newest LiDAR scanning with the iPhone 12 Pro and iPad Pro can be played back in the Looking Glass Portrait with ease. The advantage of these techniques is both aesthetic and practical \u2014 this is the easiest way to take and display 360\u00b0 captures of people, places, and objects.\n\n*Compatibility: Works with point cloud and mesh-based 3D output from most known photogrammetry software packages including Metashape, Zephyr, itSeez3D, and Reality Capture. Also compatible with the exports from LiDAR scanning packages Canvas by Occipital, SiteScape, Polycam, and 3D Scanner App. \nWe're planning on adding support for a growing number of real-world 3D capture formats, including direct conversion of stereo photos taken with cameras like the classic Fujifilm FinePix and conversion of turntable captures into holograms. \nIt is confirmed that HoloPlay Studio will support direct SBS format import in Q3 of 2021. \nMake holographic video recordings with a single click.\nFor most of us that have long dreamed of a holographic future, the ultimate goal has been to be able to record a holographic message and send that to someone across the world (or in a galaxy far, far away). Imagine sending a holographic birthday message, or saying hello as a hologram to your great-great-great granddaughter. Now you can!\nPrototype system in July 2020 showing a test video stream of an Azure Kinect depth video played back in the Looking Glass Portrait.\nThe Looking Glass Portrait comes with access to Depth Recorder, a PC and Mac compatible app that lets anyone with a Microsoft Azure Kinect, Intel RealSense depth camera, or iPhone X/11/12 record, send and play back 10-second holographic messages in their Looking Glass Portrait.\nIf you don't have a depth camera already and you're interested in recording holographic messages, the Holographic Capture Bundle comes with an Azure Kinect depth camera and custom Looking Glass Azure Kinect Stand. \nDepth Recorder also comes with a range of effects to overlay your holographic recordings. Recording above made with the Microsoft Azure Kinect\nRecorded using the Intel RealSense D435\nThe newest iPhones (X, 11, 12, 12 Pro, 12 Pro Max) have the ability to record depth videos with their front facing TrueDepth camera, and in the case of the iPhone 12 Pro and 12 Pro Max, also with their back-facing LiDAR enhanced cameras.\nRecord holographic videos for playback with apps like Record3D and import them easily into the Looking Glass software ecosystem for rapid conversion into holographic videos suitable for playback in the Looking Glass Portrait. \nCompatibility: the Depth Recorder app works with the Microsoft Azure Kinect and Intel RealSense D415 & D435. You can also playback Record3D recordings made with the newest iPhones (X, 11, 12, 12 Pro, 12 Pro Max) and even platforms like the OAK-D by OpenCV AI Kit.  \nFor professionals working with volumetric video production tools like Depthkit and Depthkit Cinema, you can now easily import your work into the Looking Glass Portrait. This media can be played back in Desktop mode or in Standalone mode. This means you can now send someone a holographic display preloaded with your volumetric video content that will run right on power-up.  \nFootage captured with Depthkit Cinema\nFor high quality volumetric video content, look no further than the few dozen volumetric capture studios operating around the world that work by pointing dozens to hundreds of cameras at a group of people on vast stages. \nLooking Glass Portrait can take in volumetric content captured in studios like 4DViews, Microsoft Reality Capture, Mantis Vision and Metastage, displaying these as three-dimensional moving images - setting the \"stage\" for the next phase of the moving image. \nFootage from volumetric capture company 4DViews\nFootage taken by Microsoft Mixed Reality Capture Studios\nCIBER GEISHA by Oscar Creativo (via Sketchfab)\nWhether you're a 3D designer, just starting to learn 3D modeling or someone who is exploring the world of 3D creations on platforms like Sketchfab, you can easily bring people, both real and imagined, into your Looking Glass Portrait.\nGLOW by XenSwapper (via Sketchfab)\nCIBER WOLF by Oscar Creativo (via Sketchfab)\nUse Looking Glass plugins for Maya and Blender for both live and rendered out scenes or import animated models with the 3D Model Importer.\nOver the past few years we've developed and refined powerful Unity and Unreal plugins for the Looking Glass lineup. Now these plugins can be used with the Looking Glass Portrait to create holographic apps of your own. \nExperimental iPhone face tracking Animoji app built in Unity\nGo to our docs page here to read more about our Unity and Unreal plugins, with more details on what's to come in the Roadmap below.\n\nNote: for developers building in DirectX, OpenGL, or Metal that want deeper levels of access and more control over how they integrate with the Looking Glass Portrait, we've developed a powerful cross-platform SDK called HoloPlay Core. More details here. \nLooking Glass Portrait works with a wide variety of peripherals in Desktop mode, allowing for advanced interaction with holograms. This includes VR controllers, various sensors for environmental inputs, tactile feedback systems, as well as hand-sensing devices like the Leap Motion Controller (part of the Holographic Capture Bundle). \nInteractive \"Blobs\" with the Leap Motion Controller. Inspired by the work of Eliza (https://www.elizasj.com/) @iamelizasj (on Twitter & IG).\n Looking Glass Documentation (Looking Glass Portrait documentation coming soon) \n Looking Glass Discord (if you have a quick question you want answered, either post in comments above or join our Discord)\n Looking Glass Blog \nThe Looking Glass Portrait is powered by the next generation of light field technology. The display works by generating between 45 to 100 views of a three-dimensional scene and projecting those perspectives simultaneously. Unlike any display that has come before it or in the market today, multiple users can gather around a Looking Glass Portrait to see different superstereoscopic perspectives without glasses or a headset.\n\nAnother way to think of this is, holograms are kind of like videos played back in space instead of time.\nAs you move around the Looking Glass, your eyes are exposed to millions of rays of light that are reproducing captured content from the real world or playing back 3D synthetic content in the most realistic way ever developed. Because of this approach, unlike other AR/VR or 3D monitor technologies which can sometimes cause nausea and discomfort, the Looking Glass Portrait produces a viewing experience that is as comfortable as you'd experience looking at the real world.\n58\u00ba view cone that hides all errant views and only shows content within the \"Hologram Zone\"\nUnlike the first generation of Looking Glass launched back in 2018, this next generation system has reworked the optical system so that the holograms are no longer \"contained\" in a volume. They can project in front of and behind the physical display, meaning you can literally touch these holograms.\nUntil now, holographic displays needed powerful gaming laptops to run even the simplest holographic media. Looking Glass Portrait can still work in that tethered mode with PCs and Macs -- but it is the first system with an additional Standalone Mode, thanks to a built-in computer (Raspberry Pi 4) and a proprietary holographic software stack that can run high-fidelity recorded holographic media at 60fps. Just plug in the Looking Glass Portrait into power via the included USB-C cable.\nAll Looking Glass Portrait units will come with an internal integrated Wi-Fi module at no additional charge. Potential Wi-Fi enabled features, such as loading and sharing of holographic media with a mobile device, are planned for release via free software update after initial shipments go out. See Roadmap below for more details.\nQuestions about how the Looking Glass Portrait works and how they compare to other displays? Ask us on Discord!\nMicro light field of a wasp sequence by Giovanni Remigi, a 3D artist and the developer of Lentigram, an interlacing software package for the production of high quality three-dimensional photographs.\nOver the years, we've built a steady, strong and vibrant 3D community around holographic displays and creation. Since we founded the company in 2014, we've witnessed creators from all over the world connect and share their work via the third dimension. We welcome all to join our community with open three-dimensional arms. \nIn the past few weeks, as we've been quietly sharing the Looking Glass Portrait with some artists in the community, we've been fortunate enough that some of them have agreed to let us share some of their work in the Looking Glass Portrait. \nTrain Station Scene by Dedouze.

Since launching the first Looking Glass in 2018, the Looking Glass Club has grown significantly and often tweets under the hashtag #\u30eb\u30ad\u30b0\u30e9\u30b9. \nWant to help us spread the word? Click this link to easily share this project on Twitter. \nThe Looking Glass Factory team is made up of dozens of Artists, Engineers and Inventors based (now, mostly remotely) out of Hong Kong & Greenpoint, Brooklyn. \nFolks from our US team\nFolks from our HK team\nThey say distance makes the heart grow fonder and while we couldn't agree more, we've had the benefit of being able to see each other as three-dimensional beings as demonstrated here with the Looking Glass Portrait.\nOne of the very first Looking Glass Portrait Prototypes\nSome additional behind-the-scenes prototype clips here. \nWe are attempting to make the Looking Glass Portrait carbon negative.\nWhile it's difficult to calculate precise environmental impact and to offset that impact for a new type of technology being made for the first time, we've calculated the embodied energy of each component in the Looking Glass Portrait as well as the average operating energy over its lifetime to the best of our knowledge. This is around 510MJ running on Standalone or 332MJ running on a PC/Mac of total energy.\nWe pay for carbon offsets from Native Energy for 2x this amount of total energy, so that each Looking Glass Portrait sold in theory will not only be carbon neutral over its lifetime, but it also should pull out its carbon-weight from the atmosphere.\nBecause this carbon offset payment comes straight from our profits \u2014 you won't be charged extra for this \u2014 we believe this will create a forcing function for our organization over time to reduce the carbon footprint of our products.\nWe surely aren't going to get this right on the first go, and we would love to hear from folks on their ideas for further improvements along the way.\nWhen we invented the first holographic light field display dev kits back in 2018, we estimated that within ten years over ten million people would have one, if they only understood its benefits.\nIllustration from 2018 when we are first starting to see the future to come.\nThe interfaces of the future wouldn't be worn on your head 16 hours a day, but they would be more like campfires glowing with three-dimensional fields of light that you could gather around with others. Sometimes in the same room, other times a world apart.\nIllustration by Jether Amar\n [Tested] Hands on Holographic Display Prototype Hands-On: Looking Glass Portrait (Jan 4, 2021) \nThis project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 1,100+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $460M raised between them.\nIn our Press Kit you'll find GIFs, images, spec sheets, and more. If there's anything else you need, write us at press@lookingglassfactory.com", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe launched the first generation of holographic display \u2014 the Looking Glass dev kits \u2014 back in 2018 right here on Kickstarter. We shipped thousands of those systems on-time and at a high level of quality, kicking off the first wave of holographic creation around the world.\n\nOur 35-person team operates between offices in Brooklyn, NY and in Hong Kong and this affords us advantages that other groups may not have. This includes the benefit of an unusually cross-disciplinary team with deep shared knowledge of both hardware, software, and supply chain. This has made us the only group in the world that has successfully shipped multiviewer holographic light field displays and we will bring that experience to this project.\n\nOf course this is a particularly challenging time, so we've taken some additional measures in advance. This includes setting up a short-run production facility adjacent to our Hong Kong laboratory for tighter control over the initial production runs, running FCC pre-checks at the prototype stage to avoid surprises during the production phase, and securing capital for inventory so that critical parts with long lead times could be ordered before the Kickstarter campaign even started.\n\nWe would only delay shipments in a few exceptional cases. If we found the production units did not meet our high standards, for instance, we would delay shipment until we could meet or exceed our quality standards. And there's always a small chance of delays in the event of a complete global shutdown of supply chain due to the pandemic. We don't expect either of these things to happen, but if they do we will be fully transparent with you along the way.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 45 or more", "title": "Hologram Club Sweatshirt", "descp": "Be a part of our community and receive a limited-edition launch special \"Hologram Club\" sweatshirt.

Soon after that he earned a reputation for having the wildest personality of everyone there. He brought this energy to his skating and also to the party scene that came hand-in-hand with the subculture.  \nDesign by Martin Falck. Photos courtesy of Theo Hand, French Fred and Antton Miettinen \u00a9\n In 2007, Ali and Shane Cross, his teammate and friend, were in a tragic motorcycle accident in Australia. Both were heavily intoxicated when Ali drove the motorcycle into a wall while Shane was riding on the back. Ali ended up in a coma, and Shane was killed. After getting lost in a long period of substance abuse, against all odds Ali managed to get back to a \u201cnormal\u201d life. Today, Ali has been sober for seven years. Each day he attends a twelve-step program, carrying the scars on his body and in his psyche, daily reminders of his past and the accident that still haunts him. \n The Scars of Ali Boulala will provide the most in-depth look into Ali's present and past ever presented on film. \nThis documentary feature film is 8 years in the making, and in its final editing phase. The director of the film, Max Eriksson bumped into Ali in a Swedish bar soon after Ali's return from Australia where he had spent some time in jail after the accident. Since then, he's been filming and interviewing Ali - throughout his recovery from drug and alcohol addiction - up until the present day. Alongside newly shot material filmed since the day they met, a large part of the film will be made up of archival material shot in the late 90s and early 2000s. \nPhoto courtesy of French Fred \u00a9\n The film tells the story of Ali\u2019s rise and fall, as well as his path toward possible redemption. Archival material shot in a variety of formats chronicling Ali\u2019s years as a pro skater forms the basis of the film. This material brings in viewers who may not be familiar with Ali and his legacy into the world of his past and introduces them to the central figures in Ali\u2019s life during that time. Through the liveliness of this archival material from a time gone by, we get a vivid picture of what it was like for Ali to live a life without limits, and as such, we come to understand the profoundness of his loss.\nAs well as his family, we have shot interviews of close friends of Ali from his skateboarding days, such as world-famous Arto Saari, Rune Glifberg, Ewan Bowman Dustin Dollin, Erik Ellington and Kevin \"Spanky\" Long.\nPhoto courtesy of French Fred \u00a9\nWe are hoping to raise this final piece of funding so we can get this long-awaited project to the big screen for you all to see.  \nMoving images on Super-8, VHS, Hi-8, and mini DV have been sourced from family, friends, and fellow skateboarders from around the world. Through images starting in the early 1990s up until and directly after the accident in 2007, the archival material takes us to Sweden, France, Spain, Denmark, The Netherlands, the U.S., Australia and beyond. Due to the diverse nature of the physical media, we have chosen to embrace and amplify the messiness of the various aspect ratios, textures and resolutions. The film, like memory, is a patchwork of past times and places \u2013 some sharper than others, some already fading with only the slightest traces still recognisable. \nBecause the archival material has been filmed in a variety of analog formats, it has to be digitized. This allows us to be able to edit the material alongside the newer material shot in the last 8 years.\n A second cost we need to cover is the licensing of all the amazing material that Max, the director has managed to unearth over the years.\n Lastly, as with any film, we'd like to make adjustments in post-production, such as color grading and sound mixing, so that we can bring the best out of the footage we have.    \nPhoto Courtesy of French Fred \u00a9\nWith support we've received from film funds in Sweden and Norway, as well as our own money, we've been able to make a rough cut of the film. However, our current budget won't stretch far enough to cover the costs needed to make a final cut and send it out into the world. This is where you could help! We really appreciate any contribution you can make, no matter how small, and we think our rewards really make it worthwhile.\n Our 35,000 euro goal is what we need to cover the first two key costs detailed above. If we raise funds up to 50,000, we'll be able to carry out the third. If we go beyond this, we'll have even more hours in the post production room with more digitized archival footage, which will make the final quality of our film even better.\nIF WE DON'T reach our goal?\nTo put it simply - we won't receive any money. Only if we reach our target after 30 days will your money be taken and your lovely rewards sent out to you. Our project will also be sent out into the world, so let's get there together!\nAli and director, Max\n Our rewards feature specially created designs for this campaign, with film merchandise signed by Ali himself, and the opportunity to spend some time with him and Max on a video call! \nFilm poster which will be signed by Ali.

Secondary goals are to play live shows when the world is available again! Unfortunately, touring will not be an option for the foreseeable future. For those that don't know, touring is the main ways musicians are able to make money off of the music that they work so hard to create. \nIf we surpass our goal, we'll be able to utilize these funds to pay for costs that would normally come out of pocket for us, such as purchasing merch, marketing the album, and possibly even pressing vinyl. \nWe know that money is getting harder and harder these days, but appreciate anything that you can send our way, following us on social media, moral support, or a few extra dollars.

It is a sign that somewhere nearby, foxes are holding a wedding ceremony. The rain makes people stay indoors, and the foxes can have their wedding unobserved by human eyes.\nThe Fox's Wedding is a fully illustrated compendium of Japanese folklore, with over one hundred entries covering a wide range of ghosts, monsters, and spirits. Every entry in the book is translated and adapted by me from Japanese sources, and many of the stories and creatures in it have never appeared in English before.\nAs the name suggests, the book features a large number of foxes\u2013kitsune in Japanese. One fifth of the book is dedicated solely to kitsune folklore, detailing the different types of kitsune, what kind of magic they do and how they do it, their society structure and power ranks, and a whole bunch of kitsune legends from across Japan.\nBut The Fox's Wedding does not feature only kitsune! The rest of the book is filled with a great variety of Japanese ghosts, monsters, and demons. There are horrific tales of murder ending in supernatural vengeance, adorable animal yokai that you'll want to keep as pets, evil ghosts in search of victims, man-eating beasts, beast-eating men, demon priests, evil trees, haunted chickens, ghostly vegetables, vampires, babies, giants, and more!\nIn addition, The Fox's Wedding contains a timely pandemic-themed chapter featuring a whole mess of evil spirits which spread infectious diseases, as well as the benevolent spirits who scare them away and protect humankind from sickness. That's something we could all use in 2020.\nThe Fox's Wedding follows the same format as my previous books. It will have 100 yokai illustrations, plus a number of double page spread chapter illustrations and a two page map of Japan. Because it is an encyclopedia there is no narrative, and you don't need to have read my other 3 books in order to enjoy it\u2013although you might find them interesting too!\nBecome a backer to get insider access and see the project behind-the-scenes.\nWho are you?\nMy name is Matthew Meyer, but you may know better me as The Yokai Guy on social media, or from my previous books, or as the creator of yokai.com. I am an American artist living in Japan. I've been translating and illustrating Japanese folklore for over a decade. My work has appeared in the New York Times, Smithsonian Magazine, the Japan Times, the Asahi Shimbun, and on NHK and Fuji TV. This will be my fourth Kickstarter as well as the fourth volume of my yokai encyclopedia series.\nFind me online: Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Patreon\nMy websites: MatthewMeyer.net | Yokai.com\nWhat happens after the project is funded?\nThe yokai illustrations and the writing are almost all done, and the structure of the book is already complete. After the project is funded, the next step will be to send the revised text to the editor for proofreading. The chapter heading illustrations and map of Japan will be completed next, and all of the artwork should be finalized by the time the text is back from the editor. After a final review, the book will go to the printer for production. I expect that to be in mid to late spring. If all goes well, the books should start shipping out in the summer.\nBackers get insider access and can watch the development of the book.\nHow will the money be used?\nThe book is written, illustrated, produced, and published by me, which means I don't have to spend a lot on outside help. But I still need to hire an editor, as well as pay for ISBNs and other fees related to publishing. The lion's share of the project money goes towards printing costs.\nFor my previous two Kickstarters I used a printer in Korea. It was affordable, but a number of manufacturing errors caused delays, extra costs, and a lot of unnecessary stress. This time I will be using a local printer in Japan. While it is significantly more expensive to print in Japan than in Korea, I believe reducing the freight costs, import duties, and warehouse fees, as well as the stress of dealing with manufacturer errors, is worth it.\nAfter printing, the next greatest cost is shipping and handling. Packing supplies, freight charges, and storage can add up to quite a bit for a large Kickstarter. Inspecting every book for print errors, organizing inventory, packing orders into boxes, loading boxes into trucks, etc. is mentally and physically exhausting, so some of the project money will also be used to hire help for those tasks.\nShipping, Customs, Etc.\nPlease note that shipping charges will be calculated after the Kickstarter is finished, in the BackerKit pledge manager. Because the project is shipping from Japan, it may be more expensive than you are used to paying for local book delivery. Additionally, some countries charge import taxes which you will have to pay upon delivery. Unfortunately there is nothing that I can do about that. I will be working with a crowdfunding fulfilment company to provide the cheapest possible shipping, but please keep that in mind when pledging.\nThe yokai sightings map from The Book of the Hakutaku\nStretch Goals and Add-Ons\nPeople love stretch goals, but they add a great deal of work which can slow down a project, and I am only one person. This time instead of adding stretch goals during the campaign, I am just unlocking every stretch goal as add-ons from the beginning.\nExtra books, paperback and hardcovers of my previous books, collector's editions, bookmarks, postcards, and art prints are all available using Kickstarter's new add-ons feature. This will make it easy for you to see exactly what you've pledged for without having to manually adjust your pledge.\nExtra Books\nYou can order extra copies of The Fox's Wedding or any of my other books in paperback, hardcover, and ebook formats. (Extra books will ship with your Kickstarter order. If you want to read my previous books now, you can order them from Amazon or your local bookstore instead.) \nthe four books in my yokai series\nBookmarks\nEach book has a specially designed matching bookmark available as an add-on. The bookmarks feature a character from the book on the front, and a Japanese protection charm against evil spirits on the reverse.\nmatching bookmarks for the previous 3 books\nPostcards\nThe yokai postcard pack has been a popular add-on in past campaigns. 20 full color postcards featuring popular yokai from The Fox's Wedding and my other books. The actual images chosen for the pack will be voted upon by backers at a later date.\nThe postcard pack contains 20 colorful A6 size postcards.\nArt Prints\nSigned art prints come in small (3.5\" x 5.5\" image in a 5\" x 7\" mat) and medium (7.25\" x 9.25\" in a 11\" x 14\" mat) sizes. They are mounted and matted on acid-free materials and printed with professional quality light-resistant inks on heavy duty acid-free art paper. All prints are signed by the artist.\nHundreds of yokai images are available as signed art prints.\nCollector's Editions\nThese very special versions are only produced in limited numbers. They are not available in stores! They include a hardcover edition, with a matching slipcase and bookmark. You can order extra collector's editions, as well as collector's editions of my previous book as add-on items.\nCollector's Edition backers can also request a personalized doodle or dedication from me in the book!\nThe Night Parade of One Hundred Demons Collector's Edition\nThe Hour of Meeting Evil Spirits Collector's Edition\nThe Book of the Hakutaku Collector's Edition\nThe Fox's Wedding Collector's Edition (concept art)", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis will be the 4th book I have produced through Kickstarter. Each time I've learned a little bit more about what worked well and what I could do better.\n\nThe biggest risk this project faces amount to delays in receiving the final project. Delays from something like an unforeseen illness, or disruptions to production or distribution due to COVID-19 are a possibility this time. However, I'm confident I can deliver this project with minimum risk to backers.\n\nHere are some of the things I've learned from past Kickstarters:\n\nInstead of launching this campaign at the beginning of the creation process, the book is already very close to being done. There is still work to be done, but you won't have to wait a year or more for it to be finished. It will be ready within months.\n\nI am using a local printer here in Japan, rather than the Korean printer I used for my previous two books. This brings the printing cost up, but will cut the cost of freight, import duties, warehouse fees, and trucks. It will also reduce the stress of handling manufacturing errors.\n\nI've timed this project to minimize the tax burden that eats up a large chunk of Kickstarter funds. This means more of the money goes to the project, and I can deliver the highest quality product possible.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Insider Access", "descp": "For people who just want to support the project without a reward.

We will show you how to take advantage of the small size and portability of the smartphone, and explain how it can do some things better than \"normal\" cameras.\n Being able to edit together videos in a non-linear editing system is an essential skill for anyone starting in video production. In this class, we will get you up to speed on the fundamentals of the art and process of editing videos using footage that you shoot yourself with your smartphone\n Our courses will follow an in-depth structure with detailed course content, hands-on activities, and comprehensive assessments that walk you through every aspect of becoming a creative professional.

Your task here is to develop a new prison for lost souls, under the watchful eye of Lilith from HR and Frank - our Hell Manager. You'll not only squeeze as much suffering as you can out of sinners, but also gain the approval of the greatest devils in hell, including Lucifer himself, who will evaluate not only your work but also... your sense of aesthetics and thriftiness. We want to give you a game, that is not only set in the lowest bowels of hell, but also full of good, black humor, which you will love, especially if you were an intern in a big corporation. \n\n\n\n\nHell Architect is a City Builder game. You play as a Hell Manager and together with some sinners you begin the development of 9 circles of hell. There are some torture devices given to your disposal, which will help you squeeze some suffering out of every sinful soul - though you have to keep in mind, that in hell nothing is free and even these lost souls need to eat, drink and... sleep. If you ignore their... hmm... comfort levels, not only will you lose your main source of income, but also enable their quick redemption. Are you sure you want that?\nTime to ask yourself - why Hell Architect? Why we've decided to make a game, that on one hand is filled with corporate jargon (quite funny, when you don't have to experience it in real life) and on the other hand touches upon a hard, controversial subject, that is hell? \nWell, the ideal person to explain the idea is none other than the CEO - Pawe\u0142. Also we want you to know that it has nothing to do with marketing - it was Pawe\u0142 who came up with this whole idea.\nOur discord community - just like us - are fans of history. More specifically: medieval castles filled with torture devices. If you ever wondered what it's like to be a Spanish inquisitor or how an Iron Maiden works, than in Hell Architect we're giving you a painless and harmless opportunity for... testing. \n\nSome people claim, that devils love Metal, but there are times when Lucyfer prefers classical music or good country music, especially when he is visited by souls all the way from Texas. The person responsible for unsetling music and dropping the base is Pawe\u0142 B\u0142aszczak, whose rehearsals caused much suffering right here in our mini studio. \nOur boss - the mortal one, not the one from hell - is a graphical designer. So you can imagine what an infernal experience creating graphics in Hell Arcitect really is - this line is too straight, this red is not red enough... No one pays so much attention to microscopic irregularities quite like him.\nNo wonder that Hell Architect is so perfect when it comes to graphics. Our poor \u0141ukasz is not done till he considers that his work is truly finished. Just look at those pics - can you see how detailed they are? Even the biblical leaf from our censored version was corrected hundreds of times. But it was worth it. \nWe talked about our game, so it is time to tell you something about us... and that's the hardest part. Our team consists of true hotspurs (infernally hot). We like to create games and we're interested in everything that's hellish. Most of us had their fair share of the corporate world, which is considered by us a real road through... hell. We started as interns, tried being Brand Managers and every posistion came with different benefits, such as Fruity Thursdays and Tuesdays, Sweet Fridays and free gym passes (you probably think that we're ripped like Hercules - we're not). No wonder that the process of creating Hell Architect was easy as pie.\nUnfotunately, suffering is not a valid currency... And we need a little bit of money to: polish our game, so that the full version is free of bugs and glitches. Testing Hell architect on numerous configurations, systems and graphic cards is expensive. The other thing is optimization - we want to bring our game to as many people as possible.\nOur corporation can't do it alone, so we need your help!\nGet Your Project Funded Today!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nTo be honest, the most dangerous risk for us is... lockdown.

Well, leave the domestic dangers of virtual reality behind with the latest, greatest must-have gaming footwear Cybershoes!\" by SYFY WIRE \nSitting in a swiveling stool and sliding Cybershoes forward and backward allows users to control their direction and speed with their own movement in VR games while also creating deeper immersion through physical activity.\nIn 2018 we conducted a successful Kickstarter, raising more than 214k Euros from more than 1000 backers. Since then we've shipped more than 3,000 Cybershoes for wired headsets on SteamVR. We're now excited to introduce a new wireless version of Cybershoes for Oculus Quest, and this Kickstarter campaign will help make this product a reality.\nBackers will not only contribute to the product's production and distribution but also fuel the number of games that natively integrate Cybershoes and general awareness to drive adoption.  \nCybershoes for Quest works for all PC VR headsets as well when used with a PC. To show continued support for our community, the new module is compatible with all Cybershoes so if you already own the system you can simply upgrade for the Quest platform. \n\nRhys Da King - Saints and Sinners gameplay: \"Testing is proving - flipping awesome\" \n First impression by Sebastian Ang: \"It looks funny but feels right.\" \n@FREE Arizona Sunshine\nYes, we\u2019re giving Arizona Sunshine to all complete Cybershoes packs! to celebrate the ending of the campaign and it's simply an awesome experience which everyone should try with Cybershoes.\n SoulFoxGaming trying a new approach to Arizona Sunshine \n The VR Realm, Paul Menton: \"I am impressed with how smooth they are working. With all the experience we have now with them - we are finding we can have long sessions without the need for a break. You will soon get over the fact that you\u2019re seated\"\nDr. Oculus: \"The Cybershoes with the Quest - fantastic, everything is wireless and [...] it's fitness, it's fun, and just so freeing.\" \n\nEurogamer, Ian Higton: \"These shoes are made for walking and that's just what I'll do\"  \nThey are compatible with Quest/Quest2 standalone, plus Quest/Quest2+SteamVR with gaming PC, and SteamVR with any PC VR headset (see: game table).\nPLAY\n\nAs legs move, the chair is forgotten in no time. What counts is that you\u2019re active and this - sort of - tricks the brain. With Cybershoes you extend the borders of your living room.  \nWireless Cybershoes connects to a Quest headset via Bluetooth and features an inside-out tracking system. The beauty is that the Cybershoes are seen as a Bluetooth gamepad by the Quest headset, making it very easy for developers to integrate.\nscheme\nThe key functionality of Cybershoes is that the shoes are keeping their orientation. You can walk in one direction and look in the other. By placing an additional IMU (gyroscope) inside the receiver, the raw shoe data can be processed in order to yield X and Y motion to the gamepad. The slider functions as an input multiplicator that lets you adjust the ratio of real-life speed to game speed. The button is used for pairing and to activate the \"Follow Cybershoes\" mode.\nPairing. With their recent firmware update (v23), Oculus has resolved the issue that Bluetooth devices are forgotten after a reboot.\nIf the game supports gamepad Cybershoes will work\nCore principles:\n* comes as a gamepad relative to HMD\n* speed should feel fast enough\n* seated mode: either your solution or try ours\n* get in touch for promo and knowhow: dev@cybershoes.io\nHelp reduce motion sickness and increase the active gaming experience!\nUnity3D: ready. Unreal Engine: WIP, please contact us with your Engine & VR SDK Version.\nThe Unity Fast SDK is a one-pager that contains all you need to know for a quick implementation.\nWe have partnered with leading VR game developer Vertigo Games to integrate Cybershoes in Arizona Sunshine. With natively integrated games, setup is as easy as strapping on Cybershoes, booting up the headset, and selecting the in-game locomotion option.\n\u201cIt is one of our core values to allow players to fully customize their preferred way to play. We have a few people in our office who are sensitive to motion sickness so we take comfort very seriously. Arizona Sunshine already supports a wide range of comfort options and Cybershoes provides an intuitive way to bring the player\u2019s physical motion into the game, allowing our players to experience VR however they like.\"\nsaid Richard Stitselaar, Managing Director at Vertigo Games. \"\nAbout Arizona Sunshine\nBuilt from the ground up for VR, Arizona Sunshine is a full-feature game that puts you in the middle of a zombie apocalypse as if you were really there. Freely move around and explore a post-apocalyptic southwestern America in a desperate search for human contact in campaign mode, join forces with a friend in co-op multiplayer, or jump into the endless multiplayer Horde mode for up to 4 players.\nThe current state of the Cybershoes integration in Arizona Sunshine\nThanks to Vertigo Games, the prototype integration already happened. You can now select Cybershoes as a movement input. This was an important step to validate our SDK, as well as to validate the low latency and accuracy of the new system. The next step is to make it possible to calibrate the player's height while being seated. That way you will have the perception of a standing eye-height for perfect immersion.\nSelect Cybershoes as your movement option: achieved. Calibrate user height: planned.\n@Native Support by Game Devs - WIP\nOur main focus during the realization phase is to get as many games as possible onto the compatibility list - directly integrated by the developer.\nWIP on native integration\n @Compatible Games\nGames you can play now with your Cybershoes\nAdditional titles have also been tested to work well with Cybershoes without native integration,  including the following. \nCurrently compatible games for Cybershoes and Oculus Quest\nPLAY\n\nPaul from The VR Realm plays Journey of Gods.\nPLAY\n\nThe Skarred Ghost in VR Chat\nWith your help, we\u2019re striving to fully integrate the Cybershoes into as many games as possible.\n\n  You can choose from the following initial reward tiers:\n\nThroughout the campaign, we will add more reward tiers as funding milestones are hit. These may include newly integrated games to be bundled with Cybershoes and others.\n\n PERK: eSport Jersey  \nCybershoes and VR Master League joined forces to bring the world\u2019s most famous VR Youtubers to the Tournament during Gamescom Digital 2020.

The \u201cCyQuest\u201d hardware is already developed and pre-production test-runs are happening right now. Those units are also out for review at YouTubers and journalists. In addition to that there are some new molded parts in shoes and the receiver. Improvements come with the chair and the carpet. We\u2019ve rendered our 2018 Kickstarter to every backer in 2019. It took twice as long as projected, and cost three times as much as we thought. We\u2019ve learned from that. We\u2019ve doubled the amount of time we are projecting for realization. We do not price dump in order to get a crazy amount of orders. You get the best price we can afford. Take into consideration, it\u2019s a low volume high-quality product. Game integration deserves a lot of attention.\n\nData\nWe do not share your data without your consent and keep it secure at all times. Cybershoes, Inc. is a subsidiary of the Austrian Cybershoes GmbH and strong GDPR rules are in place. Also, we believe that you should own your hardware. We will invite the users of the Cybershoes App to contribute to the big goal: run together to Mars. We plan to collect anonymized user data in order to understand how to optimize.\n\nThird-party dependencies\nLow probability with high impact: Oculus disables or limits functionality that Cybershoes depend on. E.g. Bluetooth or Bluetooth gamepad support gets removed completely. \n\nRisk: Some of the planned games do not work on the Quest with Cybershoes. During the implementation, certain assumptions may turn out false. Of course, we will try to compensate with other games.\n\nSoftware\nIt may turn out that not all features (e.g. the stretch goals) can be delivered in time. This should not hinder delivering the product to the backers because the software can be updated.\n\nUnforeseen threats\nRegarding Corona mitigation: we\u2019re planning on having all parts at the factory in February leaving us room for potential delays in the supply chain. Other than that, fingers crossed.\n\nCustoms\nIn the US and the EU Cybershoes will be delivered free of duty. For all products delivered in the EU, we render 20%VAT to the authorities. This explains why we try to keep the tiers at a level for the US and the EU by imposing some shipping costs on EU deliveries. Regarding other countries, taxes and customs may incur and are to be paid by the backer.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nLong-lasting design\nCybershoes are designed to last a very long time. The material is extremely sturdy that can take a full body's weight easily. Our philosophy is to provide support and backward compatibility to all models. While improving the new generation of Shoes, Cyberchair, and Cybercarpet, we managed to keep compatibility with the Cybershoes from the 2018 Kickstarter. We've spent countless hours finding ways on how to keep backward compatibility. All you need is the new Cybershoes receiver and you can use your existing Cybershoes on the Quest standalone platform.\nReusability and recyclability\nWe re-use the parts that come back to us. After a quality check, those parts may be used as spare parts where needed. We do not accept that online-retailers trash returns, we take damaged items back. We repair what is possible, or use for our own demos and quality tests. The packaging materials are minimized to the essentials. There is no stuffing. Instead of using bubble foil, we wrap the Cybershoes into the Cybercarpet. The upholstery of the Cyberchair protects sensitive parts.\nEnvironmentally friendly factories\nWe produce in Europe, we know the factory, we know the workers, we go there and can feel good about the way how they live and how they deal with environmental protection. As in almost any high tech product, the Cybershoes comes with batteries. The shoes can be opened with a standard screwdriver in order to dispose or exchange the battery. Regarding the new receiver, we refrained from placing another battery in it. We're using the USB power of the Oculus headset.\nSustainable Distribution\nFrom our 2018 Kickstarter campaign, we've learned what international shipping means: High cost and a lot of cerosine burned. For this Kickstarter, we deliberately chose appropriate shipping costs for countries that we cannot deliver the Cybershoes by means of ground transportation. We do have warehouses in Europe (Estonia) and in the United States (Oregon). We assume that 90% of the shipments can be delivered without air cargo.\nSomething else\nWith the Cybershoes product, we clearly aim for active gaming. We believe that you should use your full body when it comes to entering the virtual world. Yes, a gaming session of a few hours can be quite exhausting. But when you feel on your body that you've burned calories while having fun - that is a good moment. \nThere is also interest from projects around the world that deal with VR health care, like the VR health project from Argentina, or a project from Switzerland.

A dark vigilante film noir, tribute to Death Wish, Taxi Driver and The Exterminator.\n COMMANDO NINJA 1 FULL MOVIE: https://youtu.be/No6isuzn0FQ\n Follow Commando Ninja on: FACEBOOK,INSTAGRAM.\nCOMMANDO NINJA 2: Invasion America is the direct sequel to COMMANDO NINJA.\nCOMMANDO NINJA is a 2018 indie movie funded on Kickstarter. We had over 5 Million views on Youtube, it was dubbed and translated into 7 languages, and was supported by Kung Fury's creator David Sandberg!\nOur movie was screened all over the world in theaters, festivals, and was acclaimed as a true and sincere tribute to the classic Action Heroes era.\n WATCH COMMANDO NINJA NOW !! \nCOMMANDO NINJA 2 STORY WILL FOLLOW WHAT WAS INTROCUDED IN THE \"HOPKINS\" PREQUEL SHORT FILM:\n1988, Communists have been planning to invade America for the past 10 years, hiding entire divisions underneath major cities, moving through the sewer network, and infiltrating into the population! Nobody can believe it!\nToday is the 4th of July, the day they have chosen to launch their operation.\nHopkins is gonna have to rally the team, John, Kowalsky and Jenny to fight back, and destroy the evil at its source, the house of the rising sun, VIETNAM! When America is under Attack, When Governments can't help, if you find them, maybe you can Hire them :\n THE COMMANDO NINJAS ARE BACK TO MAKE AMERICA FREE AGAIN!!!\nTHE MOVIE will have similarities with our Prequel Comic Book published in 2019, we will use it as a reference.\nYou can READ THE FIRST 10 PAGES HERE, and BUY IT IN DIGITAL FORMAT HERE.\nHere is the Comic Book Trailer:\nAs you may know if you are already a Commando Ninja fan, we love the 80's, and particularly the Action Heroes era! \nCommando Ninja was a tribute to Commando, Predator, American Ninja and others. This time Commando Ninja 2 will take it's inspiration from movies like Invasion USA, They Live, The Red Dawn, Rambo 2, Missing in Action...\nCommando Ninja 2 will still be an over the top Action Comedy: Dark Humour, over the top violence, famous punch lines and other crazy scenes (think dinosaurs, zombies, mutants...) \nIn this sequel, our wish is also to introduce a big \"ADVENTURE\" component. Our Characters will travel in a foreign tropical environment, meeting ancient civilizations and wild animals. Think Indiana Jones meets Apocalypse Now and Jurassic Park.\nThe Action will take place in the United States of America and in the deep jungles of Vietnam. This time we are thinking big, and with zero greenscreen/CGI, we have made plans and deals to shoot both in Utah and Thailand. I personally believe that the audience can feel if something is real on screen ( Think Baby Yoda versus Jar Jar!!), and I have the will to shoot as much as possible at real locations, both for my actors and the credibility of my pictures.\nIn terms of SFX, this time we are going 100% for full live on-set practical effects, thanks to new partnerships with Armorer/pyrotechnics and Make-Up/SFX specialists. Think nice squibs, explosions, real weapon shooting, practical monsters and make-up.\nThe original soundtrack will be composed by our glorious returning composer Thomas Cappeau! Want to remind yourself of the Commando Ninja 1 OST while you read the rest of this Kickstarter? As the action will also happen in Southwest America, we will team up with Swamp Music Players among others for some real american tracks.\nI don't want to spoil too much, so here are a few COMMANDO NINJA 2 characters, some of them you already know!\n\nJOHN\n          John is a former Green Beret and Vietnam Veteran. He learnt Ninjutsu from his Vietcong Jail Keeper when he was a POW. After the events of Commando Ninja and the destruction of the Pentangle terrorist organization, he retired peacefully in a small town of Utah. He is now working hard as a truck driver to pay for his daughter's college fees.\n\"Walking in is the easy part ! it\u2019s walking out without your dick in a sling that\u2019s rough...\"\nHOPKINS\nHopkins joined the army at 16. He is a funny guy from Mississippi. He lost his arm, severed by a Ninja during Vietnam, and has now a cybernetic hand. He is one of the few who survived the communist velociraptors and became an Air Force Colonel. After the events of Commando Ninja, he was fired from the Army for stealing a time travel prototype vehicle to save his friends from the apocalyptic future of 1998. He is now working in a small municipality of Utah as a sheriff.\n\" Do you know why Americans don't have hemorrhoids? That's because all the assholes are in Canada! \"\nKOWALSKY\nMissing in Action during the Vietnam War, he was one of the 4 members of John's Green Berets Search & Destroy Unit. From Polish origins, he joined the corps at 18, known in Vietnam as the most famous \"Lizard Smoker\", specialized at dinosaurs counter-guerilla warfare.\nDuring the events of Commando Ninja, Kowalsky has been abducted by Communists. His brain was replaced by a powerful 4Mhz Micro processor, and his skeleton replaced by a combat chassis, fully armored. He was used as a hitman by Colonel Kinsky, until Jenny reprogrammed him in the future to be American again. Kowalsky now lives hidden in a trailer park, spending his days watching for UFO's.\n\"Come on, you bunch of Filthy Swingers Commie lizards jerks\"\nJENNY\nJenny was a normal child, playing video games, riding her bmx bike, chillin out with friends, going to school... Until she got abducted by a Ninja Organization and was sent to the future of 1998 where time passed 10 times faster than in the 1980's, due to the quantic correlation of the strings, and became a grown up post-apocalyptic guerrilla fighter. She is now 20 and goes to College. She's also got a new badass haircut.\n\"Kill everyone of those motherfuckers Dad\"\nLAN\nLan is a new character to the series introduced in \"Hopkins\". Vietcong fighter from 1965 to 1974, she lost her family during the American bombing over North Vietnam and carries an infinite hate for capitalism.  She is now one of the leaders of the communist invading army hiding in America. She will play a key role in Commando Ninja 2.\nHere is a work in progress example of the rewards you could own! These are only rough layouts for Kickstarter, but Definitive Artwork for the rewards (Bluray Covers, Poster, Tee Shirt) will be updated during the campaign and your opinion will count.\n\nMe posing with the Commando Ninja merchandising!\nI'm a French director based in Montpellier.  I've been working in the video games industry for the last 12 years, where I had the chance to produce trailers for famous brands like Assassin's Creed, Tom Clancy or Mario. More recently I spent 2 years in Vancouver BC, North America, and worked on stuff like Age of Empires 4, Sponge Bob and Dead Cells!\nI'm also the creator of Commando Ninja and a few other short films.\nYoutube Channel\nwww.benjamincombes.com\nAs we did for Commando Ninja, our goal is to show that we can produce a movie with a very small and limited crew, and without the stress of complicated legal stuff, huge crew / gear and big studios.\nWe did Commando Ninja with 30K. This time we are gonna need at least 3 times this budget, because we have bigger ambitions, meaning we need to work with new and talented professionals, hire new locations, and pay for EXPLOSIONS!\nMaking the HOPKINS Short film was also part of the process to improve the quality of our work. We are aiming for a more \"professional\" quality, in terms of picture and production for Commando Ninja 2.\nMoney will go to Talent, Production design, Props, Costumes, SFX, Make-Up, Catering, Travels, Locations, Stunts, Fight Choreography, Sound Design, Music... And of course the money will help to produce the Kickstarter rewards!\nWe're open to all the help we can get, so if you feel like you can contribute to this movie in any way, please contact us at: ben.combes86@gmail.com \nAsk all your questions and join the Commando Ninja 2 chat at :\nhttps://discord.gg/4WgPNaKFsF\n\nTHANKS FOR READING!!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nCOMMANDO NINJA 2 is a very ambitious project.

The working title is Stories from a Silicon Valley HR Tech Executive: The Good, The Bad & the Ugly.\"  I wrote this book to give a window into what life is really like working in tech companies with young CEOs who are changing the world. This book chronicles my life as an HR leader at 5 different tech start ups.  How I survived the exciting tech scene in San Francisco and the many lessons I learned on how to navigate being a woman and a minority in the often times homogenous world of tech.   I wanted to tell the stories of what really happens behind the scenes of start up life set amidst the backdrop of the tech worlds in both San Francisco and New York City.  \n\nI wrote this book because I wanted to provide a glimpse into the fast paced, always changing world of tech.  It was my privilege to work in 5 different tech start ups as the VP of HR.   I learned a ton about the Silicon Valley tech scene, and myself.  In this book, I share some behind the scenes footage and some stories about the things that make working in tech so hard.  It\u2019s not all free food and games every day.  It is hard work with constant deadlines and lots of moving pieces that make juggling a career in tech one of the most fascinating experiences.   \n  My hope is that, in reading this book, you will understand how the world of tech has changed how much we expect from our employers. My experiences in tech made demands on me that were sometimes at odds with who I was and what I believed.  The many stories in this book are mostly from my own perspective and serve to provide you with a window of the sacrifices I made to thrive in this fast paced, constantly pivoting, highly innovative tech industry.    \n  In this book, you'll learn about:\nHow men\u2019s bladders can expand to the size of a basketball\nHow crying at work gave me an identity\nHow it feels to be the only woman at the executive table \nYou will love this book if you:\n1) have always wondered what if feels like to work in a tech company;  2) have always wanted to know how such young tech CEOs navigate juggling multiple decisions and priorities at various points in the life cycle of their companies; and 3) have wanted to have a career in tech but haven't been able to break into it.  \n  This non fiction book is a book that speaks to anyone who wants to work in tech, start up CEOs who want to understand lessons from their own peers and anyone who wants to look at how tech has changed who we are at work.\n\nStories from a Silicon Valley HR Tech Executive:  The Good, The Bad & the Ugly \nThe book is written in four parts.\n  Part 1 contains the introduction + chapters 1-3 which describe the earlier parts of my career and how I ended up at the executive table at 5 different start up companies\n\nPart 2 contains chapters 4-7 which describe the middle parts of my career and the \u2018juicy\u2019 moments that made me question what the hell I was doing in what I thought was a very dysfunctional world.  These chapters describe how much I learned about myself and the leaders that I worked with and found my way through the maze of start up land.  \n\nPart 3 contains chapters 8-10 which describe the latter years of my career where I learn to look back and understand how I was able to thrive in these complex and always changing environments. It was only when I left my in-house roles that I could see clearly that I needed a break.  Burnout is a real struggle, but especially for those tech workers who never finish their life\u2019s work.\n\nPart 4 contains an Epilogue where I discuss what it was like to go out on my own (scary!) and then after some time off, go back in-house to do it all over again!\n \nWhat I Need & What You'll Get \nThis book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book. Money raised will go towards the following:\n\nThe editor I will work with to revise and publish my manuscript in April 2021\nThe cover design of my book\nThe layout design for the interior of my book (physical copy, e-book formats)\nThe copy editing for my book to polish the grammar and spelling prior to publication\nThe launch & promotion efforts for my book when I ultimately publish this in the Spring of 2021\nWhen I pre-sell 120 copies of my book, I will publish a paperback and ebook. When I pre-sell 150 copies of my book, I will also publish a hardcover edition. When I pre-sell 200 copies of my book, I will publish a hardcover edition and an audiobook.\n\nI am also offering some exclusive rewards for people who pre-order my book now:\nYou will receive a personally signed copy of my book when I publish\nYour name will appear in the Acknowledgments section of my book\nYou will receive early access to the Introduction and other excerpts from my book, with the opportunity to review them and give me early feedback\nYou will have the opportunity to be involved in selecting my cover and title\nAbout the Author\nMai Ton has been the VP of HR for five different tech start up companies.  She was the first HR person hired and had to build the team, the function and the company all while working with some of the youngest CEOs.  Mai has won 14 awards for her companies, and has three individual awards including Top 50 Most Powerful Women in Technology, Top 50 Tech Leaders in and Top 20 Tech Trailblazers. She is currently the Chief People Officer at Kickstarter.\n\nMai wrote this book to give a window into the life of what working in a tech start up really feels like.  It wasn\u2019t always free food and great benefits.  There were many times when she had to figure out if she was the only adult in the room.  She provides all these stories without identifying the companies or the people but the behind the scenes accounts are set amidst the backdrop of both San Francisco and New York City.  \n  Mai is a Board member of LEAP a non profit organization that helps Asian Americans break the bamboo ceiling. She is an advisor to some of the newest HR technology software companies and shares her knowledge with others by speaking at various HR conferences, where she always seems to weave in a story about her 12 year old daughter Emma. She tells us that she works hard to show Emma that her generation will ensure that working doesn\u2019t have to suck.\n\nMai received a BA in Sociology from the University of Texas, Austin. You can find her in New York City and at mai@kickstarter.com or find her on LinkedIn, and @maitonpai on Twitter.\nOther Ways You Can Help\nI know this isn't the best time to ask for a financial contribution, but that doesn't mean you can't help me:\nPlease share my pre-sale campaign on Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn with your friends, family and network.

Drawing upon numerous contemporary and modern first-hand accounts, most of which have never been made available in English, the book aims to be one of the most detailed works ever published about Japanese game development during the 1990s.\nRead the excerpt here: Hideyuki Suganami and the Birth of Seven Force\nLegends, at its heart, strives to preserve and make accessible the stories behind one of the most exciting times in Japanese video game history. The book will appeal to all who are interested in how video games were developed in the 1990s, whether diehard fans of Treasure or just discovering their games.\nThrough extensive use of translated references, Legends presents a complete picture of the different aspects involved in video game development, including:\nThe business side of running a development company\nThe game design and development process\nThe individual developers and their backgrounds, styles, and inspirations\nThe reception and legacy of the games\nFurthermore, Legends delves deep into each of Treasure\u2019s six games on the Sega Mega Drive / Genesis and presents a thorough analysis of their designs, including a detailed guide to how Treasure created the amazing visual effects for which they were famous.\nThis is accompanied by a full chapter devoted to explaining in an easy-to-understand format the workings of the Mega Drive / Genesis hardware and the creative ways that developers made use of it.\nTreasure Co., Ltd. was founded in 1992 by Masato Maegawa, a 26-year-old programmer who had just quit Konami after finishing his third year there. When he left, Maegawa managed to attract a dozen other young developers from Konami to join him at Treasure. Soon after, Maegawa made a bold, unannounced visit to Sega, had lunch with Sega president Hayao Nakayama, and negotiated a deal to develop games for the Sega Mega Drive (Genesis in North America). At the time, Sega was experiencing incredible growth due to the worldwide success of its console.\nOver the next three years, Treasure released six games on the Mega Drive:\nGunstar Heroes\nMcDonald\u2019s Treasure Land Adventure\nDynamite Headdy\nYu Yu Hakusho: Makyo Toitsusen\nAlien Soldier\nLight Crusader\nThe first of these, Gunstar Heroes, made large waves in the industry and earned Game of the Year awards from numerous publications. However, almost all of their subsequent releases were commercial failures, despite receiving high praise from critics and fans. Over the years, the reputations of these games have continued to grow, with many now being recognized as cult classics.\nThe creative and technical skill that Treasure put into each of its games makes them stand out as prime examples of the height of action game design in the 16-bit era. The rich stories behind the development of each game, despite being well-documented in Japanese, remain mostly inaccessible in English. These stories show an incredible time in video game history. Sega, at the peak of its success, gave Treasure a nearly free reign. Likewise, Maegawa gave his development staff creative freedom to make the games they wanted. The end result was a wild mixture of ideas and concepts that leapt out of the screen and that continue to impress to this day.\nSome of the many fascinating stories told in Legends of 16-Bit Game Development include:\nHideyuki Suganami\u2019s inspiration for the boss Seven Force (read the excerpt here!)\nMaegawa\u2019s strange meeting with Sega president Hayao Nakayama\nThe bizarre demands from McDonald\u2019s for McDonald\u2019s Treasure Land Adventure \nThe tragedy, and miracle, of Suganami\u2019s magnum opus, Alien Soldier \nThe joys and woes of working with Sega as a publisher\nThese stories, however, only make up a part of Legends. Each of Treasure\u2019s games is packed full of peculiar programming feats and creative design concepts, and the book explores these in detail to analyze how they work. The end result is a complete picture of Treasure as a company and the games it created.\nLegends of 16-Bit Game Development will be offset printed as a 7x10-inch premium softcover book of approximately 250 pages with full-color glossy pages. This is a book intended to be read, but it\u2019s also full of screenshots, example diagrams, concept artwork, and other visual reference materials to accompany the text. Print quality will be held to the highest standards and carefully checked before shipping.\nThis is primarily a work of historical research and documentation, but it is written in an easy-to-read, accessible style. All sources are fully and clearly documented to promote further research, and the book is full of quotes translated from the original Japanese to support and enhance the narrative.\nFor an example of what to expect, read the excerpt here: Hideyuki Suganami and the Birth of Seven Force\nI\u2019ve kept rewards simple to focus on the final product. There are three tiers of rewards:\nGaming Fanatic: The base reward is the book itself, a 7x10-inch premium softcover book with approximately 250 full-color glossy pages. All backers will have their name or a tasteful pseudonym printed at the end of the book.\nGaming Historian: For the diehard fan of video game history, I am including a Kickstarter exclusive reward: a 7x10-inch, 50- to 75-page companion booklet full of translated interviews, writings, and other primary sources related to Treasure and its games. These are the most relevant sources that were used in writing the book. This will never be published again outside this Kickstarter campaign. This reward tier also includes the main book.\nMega Driver: For the ultimate Mega Driver out there, I am offering a further reward, a chance for you to express your passion for this project and for video game history. You will be given the opportunity to write a 100-word statement to be included as a supplement to a section at the end of the book titled \u201cThe Lasting Worldwide Legacy of Treasure.\u201d The purpose of this statement is to show Treasure\u2019s impact on you, your passion for a particular game or games covered in the book, or something of a similar nature to be decided in consultation with me. Final acceptance is conditional on editorial approval. Furthermore, all backers of this tier will have their name or a tasteful pseudonym printed prominently at the beginning of the book in large, bold letters under a special heading of eternal gratitude. This reward tier also includes the main book and the companion booklet.\nMy name is John Harrison. I am a self-described historian of Japanese video games and the publisher of Mega Drive Shock, a website devoted to documenting and translating the history of the Sega Mega Drive in Japan. About ten years ago, I began the daunting task of collecting all of the documentation ever published in Japan about the Mega Drive, from gaming magazines to business-oriented books to Sega\u2019s newsletters, and that research forms the basis of this project.\nI was particularly drawn to the story of Treasure because it is, in my opinion, the most incredible of any of the small developers coming out of that era. Few other developers have managed to retain a fan base to the extent that Treasure has, and if anything, their reputation continues to grow year-by-year. In writing this book, I hope to share and preserve in physical format the stories behind Treasure and its games. These stories are more than worthy of preservation and the thought that they might be forgotten is a sad one.\nI currently live in North America, although I spent the majority of my adult life in Japan, where I resided for over 10 years and where I grew to appreciate Japanese games. In my day job, I am a teacher and research scientist.\nI have completed the research for the book and I am in the process of writing, with about 40% of the book done as of the creation of this campaign. I expect to be finished with writing by April, 2021, at which point the editing process will occur. I will be using the services of a professional copy editor to ensure the highest standard for the written text. Concurrently, I will be working on the layout of the book. I expect editing and layout work to take two months. Following that, it will take approximately two months to print the book and ship it to distribution centers. The initial shipments to backers are expected to go out around August, 2021 at the earliest.\nShipping costs are calculated in addition to the base reward amount. Shipping will primarily be from the United States, but I will also employ a distribution center in Europe to expedite the process and reduce costs. Backers in the EU should not have to pay any import taxes, and the shipping value will be marked to reflect the actual cost of printing.\n\nVideo music by Shane Ivers - https://www.silvermansound.com", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are risks associated with any project like this, especially related to maintaining the time schedule to get the books in backers\u2019 hands.

Film director Terry Gilliam is known for creating these strange, marvelous worlds. He does things like having an artificial prop sun appear in the real world and such. When I was making the design proposal for the game, I thought it would be interesting to try to create a world like that. Then, when we did the initial implementation, I thought it looked pretty good so I decided to focus more on it. That was the point where I knew I had to go for it completely.

The final week's issue contained a lengthy round table discussion between five of Sega's greatest developers, including Treasure founder Masato Maegawa.

The first chapter of the book deals with Masato Maegawa's background--how he started programming, why he joined Konami, the games he worked on there, his impetus for creating Treasure, and so on. Part of this research involved delving into the history of Japan's 'micom' (microcomputer) boom at the end of the 1970s. Maegawa, like many other Japanese game developers of the 1980s and 1990s, was introduced to programming during this time, when Japanese manufacturers such as NEC, Sharp, and Fujitsu started to release affordable home PCs. These PCs typically came equipped with a variant of BASIC, and many future game developers in Japan got their start through experimenting with it. The impact of the micom boom on the video game industry in Japan was profound, and reading about it makes me imagine the excitement that an entire generation of Japanese youth must have felt experiencing the joys of computers and programming for the first time."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #3", "update_userinfo": "Only 18 Hours Remaining!", "update_content": "This is a last call to anyone who is still interested in backing but hasn't done so yet: there are just 18 hours remaining!\nThe companion booklet (full of a ton of fascinating, never-before-translated Treasure interviews and writings) will only be available in this campaign, so be sure to get it if you're interested.\nOnce again, I want to give a big thank you to all the backers who made this happen, and also to everyone who has been sharing this campaign around the internet.

Most of the time this chaotic process just makes an unredeemable ugly mess. But occasionally, rarely, something wonderful and impossible happens: a beautiful pattern emerges, or a strange looking animal or an alien landscape.\nThis has sobering philosophical implications for how complexity and even we ourselves might have come into existence. Opponents of evolutionary theory argue that \u201cintelligent\u201d order can never come out of chaos\u2014but I see counter-entropy happening in my fractal models on a daily basis. True, I do act as an environmental pressure on the process, allowing only the patterns that please me to \u201csurvive\u201d. But those happy accidents do occur on a regular, if rare, basis.

It is a term that refers to the different treatment or moral consideration of individuals based on their species. Why do we value the life of a dog more than the life of a cow? The answer is not scientific but purely cultural. With this film, we want to raise the important question, if it is morally justifiable to exploit other non-human animals by consuming and using them as we do in our daily lives.\n\nDEUTSCH: Ich m\u00f6chte meine F\u00e4higkeit, Filme zu drehen und meine Leidenschaft als Tierrechtsaktivistin nutzen, um eine Geschichte \u00fcber ein Thema zu erz\u00e4hlen, \u00fcber das nicht genug gesprochen wird: Speziesismus. Es ist ein Begriff, der sich auf die unterschiedliche Behandlung oder moralische Ber\u00fccksichtigung von Individuen bezieht. Allein abh\u00e4ngig von ihrer Spezies. Warum sch\u00e4tzen wir das Leben eines Hundes mehr als das Leben einer Kuh? Die Antwort ist nicht wissenschaftlich, sondern rein kulturell bedingt. Mit diesem Film wollen wir die wichtige Frage aufwerfen, ob es moralisch vertretbar ist, andere nicht menschliche Tiere auszubeuten, indem wir sie in unserem t\u00e4glichen Leben nutzen und konsumieren.\n\n\n Who are we? - Wer sind wir?\nThe Team - Maurice Cannon, Franziska M\u00fcller, Ufuk Kubat, Hyung-Guhn \"Hugo\" Yi\nENGLISH: We are three film students from Germany who are currently graduating from university with this project.

Furthermore, Hyung-Guhn \"Hugo\" Yi, who has already graduated, also joined the team as a producer.  \nWe want to create an exciting and thrilling film, that is not only fun to watch, but that will make people think. \n\nDEUTSCH: Wir sind drei Filmstudenten aus Deutschland, die mit diesem Projekt ihren Bachelor of Arts abschlie\u00dfen werden.

We can build a forest-hut-set in our university's studio facility. It's a key scene in the movie and to make it look unique, we have to invest in proper materials. \n\nTransportation and accommodation: Both of our main actresses' transportation and accommodation costs need to be paid. Also, we need a budget for the fuel used, transporting a 15-people-crew to all our shooting locations and back home. :)\n\nCatering: We do have a great vegan restaurant from Frankfurt am Main sponsoring parts of our catering.

Since we are already starting the shoot on the 15th of October, we are assuming that no major changed in those guidelines will occur until then, which would prevent us from making our film.

With the help of this book, you can learn these skills too.\nProsciutto ham and cheese. These foods are often taken for granted, or seen as too complicated to make at home, but are actually quite simple processes that this book can teach you.\n\nIt\u2019s often intimidating to face learning all the skills we need for a future off the grid. With A Year in an Off-Grid Kitchen, you can treat it as a self-paced homestead cooking course, or just pick the book up and learn something new whenever you like.\n\nKimchi. I share the easy fermenting recipes and techniques that are staples in my home, and the same ones that I sell to my market customers. I provide clear instructions that suit anyone from beginners to advanced cooks, one recipe tester said \u201cThis is the first ferment I've made that I felt like I could trust!\u201d\n\nThe book\u2026\nAround 220 pages in length, 10.75\u201d by 8.25\u201d in size, the book is packed full with over 100 recipes to make, skills to learn, and tips and tricks to make real food cooking work in busy lifestyles, wherever you are.\n\nThe recipes are not just any recipes, but adaptable everyday ones that you\u2019ll want to make over and over, using easily-found ingredients.\n\nThese recipes have been tested  in many different kitchens, and will work on wood stoves as well as conventional electric and gas cookers. These are the recipes that fuel my homestead. I\u2019ve included many variations and ingredient substitutions to help you make the recipes with whatever ingredients are on hand at the time.\n\nThe book is presented in full colour, with lots of full-page photos, plus smaller photos on some pages.\n\nI\u2019m putting a lot of effort into creating good indexes to make the book even more useful - including an index by ingredient, so you can quickly make use of seasonal produce or food that needs to be used up, an index by meal is also provided, so you can easily find the right meal to suit your day, whether it be ideas for breakfast, quick meals to get on the table fast, or slow cooking and make-ahead meals.\n\nFollowing the seasons...\nLate winter\nA Year in an Off-Grid Kitchen begins in late winter, where we learn how to make bone broth, soups, and stews from storage vegetables such as potatoes, cabbage, carrots, turnips, and other roots. This chapter offers a great starting point where you can dive in at any time of the year to create nourishing budget-friendly meals from local ingredients.\n\nRecipes include\u2026\n\u2022Beef and Winter Vegetable Minestrone\n\u2022Farmhouse Vegetable and Barley Stew\n\u2022Beef, Beetroot, and Caraway Stew\n\u2022Indian Lentil and Vegetable Stew\n\u2022Japanese Beef Curry\n\u2022Mexican Lentil Soup\n\u2022Classic Pumpkin Soup\n\u2022Chickpea and Chorizo Stew\n\u2022Welsh Leek and Lamb Stew\n\u2022Indian Lamb Stew\n\u2022Turmeric Braised Vegetables\n\u2022Braised Red Cabbage with Apple and Onion\n\u2022Anyvegetable Gratin\n\u2022Parsnip and Rutabaga Mash\nBeef, Beetroot, and Caraway Stew\nEarly Spring\nIn early spring the focus is on eggs and greens. Not just the cultivated greens in the garden, but wild ones from the land and the sea. You\u2019ll learn how to forage, prepare, and cook wild, perennial, and garden greens, how to preserve nettles, how to forage and preserve edible seaweeds, along with an abundance of tasty egg recipes.\nRecipes include\u2026\n\u2022Simple ways to serve greens: Greens cooked after sausages, greens in cream sauce, kale chips, greens and kelp, herb and cheese omelette, any vegetable frittata.\n\u2022Green and Egg Slabs\n\u2022Thai-Style Greens, Carrot Noodles, and Eggs\n\u2022Hueveros Rancheros\n\u2022Bacon and Egg Fried Rice\n\u2022Korean Egg, Green, and Rice Bowls\n\u2022Cream of Wild Green Soup\n\u2022Green Egg Drop Soup\n\u2022Lamb Dolmade Casserole\n\nKorean Egg, Green, and Rice Bowls\nLate Spring\nIn late spring we focus on home dairying. This chapter includes all the skills you\u2019d normally learn and use from an entire book about home dairying, but focusing on just the important stuff - butter, sour cream, hard cheese, yoghurt, DIY cheese starter cultures, soft cheeses, and melty mozzarella. Feedback from recipe testers is that \"this is a fantastic introduction for people to the cheese making world\".\nRecipes include\u2026\n\u2022Cr\u00e9me Fra\u00eeche (Sour Cream)\n\u2022Butter\n\u2022Ghee (Clarified Butter)\n\u2022Yoghurt\n\u2022Yoghurt Cheese\n\u2022Kefir\n\u2022Ricotta\n\u2022Paneer\n\u2022Soft Cultured Cheese (Ch\u00e9vre)\n\u2022Mozzarella\n\u2022Tomme Hard Cheese\n\u2022Feta\n\u2022Paneer Makhani or Butter Chicken\n\u2022Butternut Squash and Spinach Salad with Cheese\n\nHomemade cultured butter and other dairy staples are easily made from scratch once you learn my simple techniques\nEarly Summer\nIn early summer the focus is on new potatoes, and foods that go well with them, along with foods to share at picnics, and simple summer recipes.

Many cookbooks are written by people that are either professional chefs, or have smaller households to feed, that have time to do fiddly techniques to prepare smaller amounts of food. My recipes are flexible, to provide for varying household sizes, but the techniques I use are ones that produce lots of food and taste, using minimal effort and time, from local, natural foods. A book with this approach is desperately needed to help us reclaim food security skills and cook from scratch even in busy times.\n\nStretch goals!\nAll backers at the ultimate supporter level and up will receive the following extra goodies if the stretch goals are met:\n\nUNLOCKED - $15,000aud ($10,950usd) Stretch goal - Rocket Ovens digital dvd by Paul Wheaton\nThis 2 hour documentary will show you how to build the most efficient off-grid oven.

The writing, testing, photography, and design work are all done.

With this in mind, this time I have allowed a longer deadline for getting backer copies sent out than what I\u2019m likely to need, so while you can expect them before the end of March, you might be pleasantly surprised to have them arriving earlier than expected.\n\nI will send out updates keeping you informed of the progress, so that you\u2019ll know what stage things are at, and when your book is in the mail.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge AU$ 1 or more", "title": "Thanks!", "descp": "Thank you!
