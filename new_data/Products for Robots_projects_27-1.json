Please be aware of this when you pledge. Small rocket ships and dice are choking hazards. Keep out of reach of small children.\nGameplay-\nPlayers begin the game by launching off of Earth. Every turn players draw a card and roll 2 dice for movement (1 Black and 1 Blue.) After rolling, players choose which die they want to use for movement (Usually the higher number.) Once a die is chosen, the player must check to see if there are any gravitational effects acting on their space ship. (The gravity value can be found by checking the space that the space ship is on and looking for the corresponding negative number.) If there is any gravity affecting the player's ship then the value of the gravity is subtracted from the player's movement for the turn. If doubles are rolled then the player still use only one die for movement but gets an additional movement roll. (Only once max per turn.) Action cards may be played at any time during a player's turn to help them. (Action cards cannot be played during other player's turns.) Action cards spice up the game by powering up spaceships to move faster or destroying other bonuses your opponents may have. A player must use a balance of fast movement, luck, and strategic card playing to speed past the other racers. The first player to reach Earth 2 wins!\nNote: Landing on another player's rocket ship sends them backwards to the previous planet they passed (Start space if still in Earth's Gravity Field.)

Those historic words resound in my head. The world turns\u2026100 years have passed and the Earth once again dreams big. But this time the space race has much more at stake. The sun has become unstable. Mass solar flares are becoming more and more frequent and life on Earth may soon be impossible. Our mission cannot fail. Luckily we have found another earth-like planet and a brilliant scientist has just unlocked the secrets to space travel and achieving warp speed. In order to do this we must build up enough speed by using the gravitational pull of the planets in our solar system. Time is running out.

This is because you design the very track you're racing on... while you're racing on it! How it comes together is up to those playing, and manipulating the track to your advantage or against your opponent's advantage plays a large factor in determining the victor. You can even design your own short-cut to jump to first place!\nCoupled with this unique game mechanic, players during the race also gain insane and fun-to-use items; Items like the Booster, which lets you jet ahead of the competition; The Dodge Ball, which whacks your friends and slows them down; The Squirrel, which creates a roadblock forcing players to change course; Or the Bomb which decimates the track and all on it. Plus more items that shift the balance of the game! What's more, some items are left right on the track to benefit or to hinder your friends, and other items can even be used to defend yourself, making each game unique and strategic.\nKrash Karts offers a familiar but new experience combining the feeling of kart racing-inspired video games with a simple yet engaging map-building game mechanic that brings a new and exciting hybrid genre of board game to the table.\nOne even more incredible and truly one-of-a-kind feature that Krash Karts offers, once unlocked via Stretch Goal, is selectable Character Cards with unique abilities that act as your driver. Why is this special? Amazingly, 6 Character Cards are characters from popular independent board games seen on Kickstarter, with the blessing and permission of each individual game's designer. These characters come from games such as Villages, Tiny Epic Kingdoms, Zogar's Gaze, Plague: The Card Game, Hero Brigade, and Tower, with special characters from even more indie table top games that are kept secret until they are unlocked via another Stretch Goal! One bonus character, to support all avenues of this industry, is also included featuring the mascot from the interview blog The Inquisitive Meeple. Further, 2 Character Cards can be designed by you through a special pledge level that will unlock once the first Character Card Stretch Goal is reached at 2k!\nIt's worth noting though that these Character Cards aren't necessary towards playing the game, as it can be played with or without them! Consider them more of a fun bonus!\nKrash Karts is a re-named and slightly re-themed version of the game I designed, originally titled 'Mad Rush Rally'. In a sense, it is the second edition version. The game had refined itself over the almost 2 years it has spent on TheGameCrafter.com, and received favorable success.\nClick here to view The Inquisitive Meeple's interview with the designer and learn even more about Krash Karts!\nWhy is your funding goal so low?\nI'm a relatively new designer and take my game and my campaign very seriously, I cannot express that enough. By having a low goal I am hoping to guarantee that I'll get my game out into the world! I have the utmost confidence in my game, and I know it will be a stepping stone towards helping establish my name as a table top game designer, but I also accept that has to start modestly. Further, I've kept my pledge levels relatively simple so as to focus on delivering my game to you swiftly. Once again, I can't thank you enough for your time and consideration!\nHow to Play\nHere is a brief video showing a summary of how the game is played:\nWhy Kickstarter?\nAs table top gamers know, Kickstarter.com has proven a fantastic method for an independent board game designer to present a hard-worked-on board game to the masses for a reasonable price. By having your pledges I am able to guarantee you the best price I can by buying in bulk. This allows the cost of the game to come down to a very reasonable price point, which is something I focused on. Thank you for your interest and I hope you consider backing this project!\nWith each copy of Krash Karts it contains the following. Components can upgraded or unlocked as Stretch Goals are unlocked during the campaign.\nBase Game Components:\n1) 2-piece Box\n2) 1 Full Color Glossy Rulebook\n3) 18 Track Cards\n4) 5 Short-Cut Cards\n5) 1 Starting Line Card\n6) 70 Item Shards\n7) 6 Plastic Kart Pieces\nUnlockable Components:\nUNLOCKED! - 9 Character Cards: Unlocked Via 2K Stretch Goal. These cards add a fun layer of extra strategy and intensity to the race. 6 are from independently designed table top games, 1 from a board game interview blog, and 2 are designed by people like you via an unlocked pledge level.\nUNLOCKED! - 6 Kart Cards: Unlocked via 3K Stretch Goal. These allow players to keep track of which color they are and help sort their items based on if the items are being played defensively.\nUNLOCKED! - 3 More Character Cards: Unlocked Via 5K Stretch Goal. 3 More characters from independently developed games are added to the roster. Their identity was a mystery until now!\nLOCKED - Ghost Kart Expansion: Unlocked via 10k Stretch Goal. A Krash Karts expansion for a game with 3-6 players: The 'Ghost Kart' Expansion adds an element of mystery to the race, where all players are criminals escaping the law, but one player is a undercover cop posing as a your fellow criminal. As players race from a bank robbery to a safe location, the cop attempts to arrest them as discreetly as possible without the remaining players cluing in to which player is the traitor! Things get intense when only two remain! A great, unique, and entirely new way to play the game!\nNote: The pledge levels below are in Canadian currency. When you bid, your pledge will convert into your native currency upon transfer of funds.\nIf you would like to add one or more copies of Krash Karts to your pledge, simply increase the dollar amount of your pledge by the following prices listed based on where your shipping address is located.

Manufacturing and fulfillment have already been arranged. The challenge will be drawing enough of the right attention to the game so that we can reach our goal.\n\nOnce our goal has been reached everything will come together quickly and efficiently. Manufacturing does take time though, so we will be able to deliver the games and all stretch goals to you in a reasonable period of time. We look forward to fulfilling your orders!\n\nQuestion and Answer:\nQ:Who will be handling the manufacturing?\nA:It depends on the amount funded, but currently we plan on using The Game Crafter LLC.\n\nQ: Who will be handling fulfillment (shipping the product)?\nA: Once again, this is based on how the campaign funds, but we plan for the finished product to be handled by The Game Crafter LLC's bulk order fulfillment center to distribute to those whom pledged toward a copy of the game.\n\nQ: How long will it take to receive the game?\nA: 3 Months or less. If we use a different manufacturer based on the campaign's funding, it will be around 6 months.\n\nQ: If you're Canadian, why charge extra shipping to Canadians?\nA: Manufacturing and fulfillment are both being handled by a third-party company based in the US. I tried to keep the shipping costs as low as possible for both Canadians and International backers.\n\nQ: If I'm a store owner, will Krash Karts be in a sell-able format?\nA: Each copy of Krash Karts will be shrink-wrapped and will have a registered a barcode plainly visible on the side of the game's box.\n\nQ: Who did the artwork and graphic design?\nA: Both were handled by the game's designer, Sean McDonald. The artwork for most of the Character Cards were based on designs by other artists' work from their respective games, and we claim no ownership of these character properties. The designer also being the artist for the game allows things to come together quite quickly, so the down time between the campaigns end and receiving your game will be very minimal.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #32", "update_userinfo": "A second life.", "update_content": "Hey!

Everything has to tie-in together! There will be a few rounds of play-testing for a couple months, but let's just say I'm already working on the Kickstarter page!

In Train Heist, each player plays as one cowboy with their own personal henchman of their choosing, each with unique abilities, and work together to stop the train-riding Sheriff Bo from stealing all of the folks of Crackpot Canyon's life savings. Unlike a traditional board game with a set path and place to go, Train Heist uses a free-range board where players can go anywhere they need to get the job done. Players work together, not against each other, to rob a train constantly in motion! In this fun and hectic cooperative game players collect their nerves as they excitedly rush to reach their set goal. Using a special non-traditional deck of poker cards players create poker hands and share cards to do special moves or rob the train. Player's will find themselves running on top of train cars and narrowly escaping the sheriff to bring their loot back to the townsfolk!

We have since we started dating, and it has only continued as a married couple. Don't know why. It just... speaks to us. After making our own roleplaying game about Angels a couple years ago, we wanted to make a card game about them. And we have. Introducing Angels - Michael's War, a card game for 2 - 4 players. \n(Here all about the game and us on our All Us Geeks interview!)\nCheck out our free Print'n'Play for the complete rules and the basic set of game cards.\nSet-up: Inside the game box, there is a Divine deck cards, and an Infernal deck cards. To set-up, shuffle both decks separately. Deal out 4 Divine cards to each player. Turn the top 3 Infernal cards face-up on the table to form the Center Row. Choose a player to go first, and you are ready to go.\nExample: Game Set-up\nPlaying the Game:\nOnce it is set-up, the game is played in rounds, with each player taking a turn in the round. On your turn, draw 1 Divine card and add it to your hand. Then, try to defeat Demon cards or claim Major Victory cards from the Center Row. Each card in the Center Row has one or more Faith, Hope, or Love symbols on them. Play one or more cards from your hand with matching symbols of a Center Row card, and you get the card.\nExample: This Demon card requires 2 Hope to defeat. Since the player played 2 Angel cards with 2 Hope between then, they defeat the Demon!\nPut all the cards played, defeated, and claimed in your Score pile to be scored at the end of the game. Replace any cards taken out of the Center Row with new Infernal cards, and let the player to your left know it is their turn.\nThe game ends when 3 or more Major Victory cards have been claimed by players at the table at the end of a round, or one of the two decks run out of cards. Once that happens, everyone adds the Victory Points (VPs) on the cards in the Score pile. The player with the most Victory Points wins the game.\nExample: A lot of Victory Points (VPs) to end the game!\nAdd in that some cards have special abilities that give you more Victory Points at the end of the game, or make it harder to get Demon cards out of the Center Row, and you've got Angels - Michael's War.\nSince this is probably the first time you have ever heard of us, we didn't want to come to you with a half-finished project. So, as it stands, this game is... well... it's done. \nWe have all the art completed (by 2 different artists). \nThe game has been play-tested for over a year and a half. \nWe even have a year's worth of expansions done, drawn, and ready. \nThis thing is ready to get some play-time at your game table. And that's really why we're here.\nOur goal is simple: get lots of people to enjoy the game. To do that, we need to print lots of copies of the game. Since we have a year's worth of expansions already done, we've come up with two ways for you to enjoy Angels: the Basic game and the Deluxe game.\nThe Basic Game ($20 U.S./ $35 International)\nIncludes: 70 cards, rules, and a travel-size tuck box. This is how the game will be released for sale once we successfully fund.\nThe Deluxe Game ($52 U.S. / $82 International)\nIncludes: 70 cards from the Basic game, 50+ extra cards from upcoming expansions, 1 game board to play on, 4 point trackers to score the game at the end, 1st player token marker, rules, and a large telescoping box. This is a special version of the game includes the entire year's worth of expansions and extras we created for the game.\nAt this time, we are not doing stretch goals or add-ons. Really, the Deluxe version of the game has everything we wanted to have in the game by the end of the year. \nBecause this game is ready to go, we don't have to wait forever for anything. At the end of the campaign, we will send you a survey asking you about addresses to ship games to and whatnot. Once we get all those back, we'll order the games and have them to your house straight from the manufacturer so that you get it as soon as possible. Our goal is for you to have the game in your hands before the GenCon 2014 game convention.\nAfter everyone has their copy of the game, we are going to release this game for sale to the general public through Print-on-Demand sites like TheGameCrafter.com. That way you don't have to wait for another Kickstarter or the like to get more copies of the game, and we never have a \"sold out\" problem. \nAlso, all of the expansions we have planned for the game (the extra stuff in the Deluxe version of the game) will be released as Print-On-Demand throughout the next year. And, yes, we'll let you know when they are available via e-mail and update... maybe even before anyone else can buy them.\nWe believe in Angels. We have a plan, we have the artwork, and we have expansions ready to support it for at least a year after release. Then... we're doing the dice game. :)\nAaron and Stephanie Richardson. We're a husband and wife team from the St. Louis region of Missouri who have loved making and playing games for years. In 2009, we started A'n'SR -entertainments to officially publish our little creations. Now, we're here on Kickstarter for the first time using our experience to bring a great game to the masses.\nAlan Earl (ArtofALE.com). Alan is Steph's cousin, though we consider him a brother. Heck, he's the Godfather of our only son, so we think highly of him. We knew he could draw, and when he saw the really early prototype of the game, he asked if he could draw a few cards. He's never drawn anything commercial before, but we said sure anyhow. His first piece of art blew us away, and we asked him to draw all the cards for the game (except set VI). He's done an amazing job, and he's done it all with a mouse on an old version of Photoshop and a Windows XP machine. We're hoping he gets enough money to get a WACOM or something when this is over.\nRachel Shuldt. Rachel is a college student that happens to go to our church. In fact that's how we met her. She was trying to earn money for a church trip, and we offered to pay her for some art. We rejected some, demanded changes to others, and ended up with 5 great pieces for the game. When we came up with the concept of our \"Shadows & Light\" expansion, her art fit perfectly. We can't wait to see what she does next.\nLayla Earl. There is a certain art to being kind to people and posting things on Facebook. Layla, Alan's wife, is our expert for just that. This allows us to work our magic, while she works hers.\nwww.AnSR-entertainments.com", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have been making games since 2009, and all that knowledge has helped us reduce the risks associated with making this game. We have a great manufacturer lined up to print and ship the games to you. In fact, we have used them for years now for our board and card games, and they do great work. All of the art is done, and the game is literally waiting for us to hit the print button.\n\nAll that being said, however, things could happen. We could get hit by a plague. Our guardian Angels could fall asleep at the wheel and let something catastrophic happen to us. Our manufacturer could go out of business. The US Postal Service could decide to double their shipping rates. Tons of things could happen. We have mitigated the things we can control as much as we can, and we'll pray that the rest stays away until you get to play the game.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #20", "update_userinfo": "Angels is Going Live This Weekend", "update_content": "Aaron from A'n'SR here.

The team that can shoot down more targets may be the better shot, but the team that scores the most points is obviously the winner\u2026 be careful to not shoot the wildlife or it could cost you!\nUpdate:  Foul Tokens!\n Backers at the SHOOTERS BOX tier will now receive 16 custom acrylic tokens perfect for tracking Fouls! They are laser cut acrylic and measure 1.25\" across and will come in a sturdy velvet pouch large enough to store both the tokens and the game. Tokens are also available as an add-on for only $5 at any pledge level!\nPULL! - A Trap Shooting Card Game is a partnership style card game that draws inspiration from classic trick-taking games such as spades, whist, and euchre. Unlike these traditional games:\nThere is no trump suit\nThere are two active tricks each round\nPlayers cannot \"win\" the lead \nAt the start of each hand, the dealer deals each player 10 cards from the Shot Deck and flips over the top two cards of the Target Deck. Each Target is worth a number of points and players take turns playing one Shot card on each Target. The team that plays the highest valued Shot wins the Target and scores the points, but you must play carefully, because shooting the wildlife will cost you! Additionally, if a team scores both Targets, they may receive bonus points. \nA hand lasts five rounds then points are tallied and recorded. The deal is passed to the left and play continues in this fashion until one team scores a set number of points.\nRules are also included to play the game as individuals with 2, 3 or 4 players.\nRead the Rules \nGoogle Docs\nFull Color PDF\nI write extensively about my game designs from concept through finished product. I share a ton of my work on Twitter in a sort of live-tweet fashion, but I write full articles on my page detailing the design process. I have been actively developing and testing PULL! for over five months and I've written many articles about the changes I've made and the reasons for making them. You can find all the PULL! articles by following this link to my website, cheveedodd.com.\nYou will need to provide a method to keep score. Pencil and paper works great.\nAlso, available is a companion app for Android and soon iOS. This app will help you keep score, track Fouls, and also has a reference set of rules. Get the app now on the Google Play store!\nThanks to over a dozen print and play test groups from all over the globe, PULL! went from a game that was strictly playable to a game that is actually fun to play. I owe this design to everyone that helped me along the way... and there's still time to help!\nPULL! is available right now for print and play. I believe fully in this game and welcome you to give it a try before you pledge. The card backs vary slightly in design from the Kickstarter rewards, but only to make them a more printer friendly. Otherwise, the art and graphic design remains unchanged and is provided at full resolution.\nDownload the files!\nThe promotional card will be 2.75x4.75 inches and will feature a special message to all backers on one side, and original art on the front chosen by the Backers.

Finding publishers to bring my games to market takes up a significant amount of my time and money. Scallywags is doing well, but it doesn't offset my costs alone. I've decided it\u2019s time to start getting more serious. I want to take control of some of my own projects so that I can continue to focus on providing valuable content and fresh games. I regularly release free print and play games on my website, cheveedodd.com, along with articles and tutorials centered around board games and design and I would like to continue providing this content without monetizing the site with advertisements and subscription fees.\nThis year, I formed Chevee Dodd, LLC so I could spend more time on this adventure. I am offering my graphic design skills to help offset the expense of designing games and pursuing publication. I will continue to pursue traditional publication for many of my projects, but I also have quite a few more unique games that I\u2019d love launch with your support!\nPULL! is a non-standard game with a quirky theme and underused mechanics. Publishers continue to tell me that there is no market for trick-taking games. I disagree with them. I think players enjoy these types of games and I\u2019m here hoping that you\u2019ll show me some support in bringing my game to life. Backing this game not only supports my efforts with PULL! but will help launch my newly formed company!\nI am working with multiple manufacturers to make PULL! the best it can be. Meeting the funding goal will allow me to fulfill the game through thegamecrafter.com and receive their maximum discount. This option is the best I can find for short run printing. The Game Crafter cards are printed on 270gsm wax-coated card stock and will be packed in a tuck box printed from the same stock. I have used their services for two years now and I am very satisfied with the quality of their product and service. \nIf we exceed the project goal, I will be able to scale up production with a larger-run manufacturer which will allow me to print on higher quality card stock and provide sturdier  packaging options. It is difficult to put a dollar figure on this sort of production scaling, so here is my pledge to do what is best for the game. I am dedicated to using only US manufacturers and printing small runs domestically is very expensive... but I'm not here to line my pockets and increase my profit margins. I'm here to make a great game the best it can be!\nThank you for checking out my first Kickstarter project!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe game has been thoroughly playtested thanks to many print and play testers. The rules and packaging have been proofed and edited. All the art and graphic design for the game has been completed barring any additional work from unlocking stretch rewards. What this means for you is that there should be little to no delay in getting this game to the printers shortly after the campaign funding is transferred to me. \n\nSo, what could hold things up?\n * Unexpected legal issues.\n * Natural disasters.\n * Postal workers strike.\n * Personal injury or disease.\n * Awesome ideas from Kickstarter backers.\n\nThis is my first Kickstarter project, but I\u2019m confident in my own abilities to bring PULL! to market. I've produced many of my own games through print on demand services as well as print and play files through my personal sites and boardgamegeek.com.

Click here to see that forum once it launches.\nIf you'd like to follow updates specific to this project or order some dice for yourself, this link will bet set up to bring you to the right place.\n----------\nHelp us provide the gaming community with customized 16mm (standard size) D6 dice - with more colors, shapes, and sizes available when we reach higher funding levels!\nNote: Remember, your reward can be divided into multiple designs and even multiple shipments. When splitting it into multiple shipments, you just pay the shipping charges on any shipment after the first.\n\nExample: If you pledge for two dozen dice, you can get 24 of the same design OR 4 each of 6 different designs OR 24 completely different designs (or anything in between). And your reward can be split into as many shipments as you like.\nThese add-ons are available to anyone with a pledge level of $6 or more (anyone actually receiving a shipment). You can include as many add-ons with your pledge as you like.\n\nShipping: No additional shipping charges required for add-ons.\n\n\nRight now, if you want to make custom dice for a game prototype, print-n-play game, or just to customize your old Yahtzee! game, it'll cost you several dollars per die - before shipping.\nWe see a way to provide the same quality engraved custom dice at a fraction of the cost. But we can't do it without your help, we need funds to purchase the necessary supplies and equipment (primarily meaning thousands of dice and a Trotec laser engraver)!\nHere are some examples of people we've teamed up with so far to bring you cool designs:\nWe've teamed up with Potluck Games, the creators of Dungeon Dice, and have some exciting news as a result! They are designing an official die for Dungeon Dice that will be available exclusively through CGL.\nPlus they have agreed to allow us to use a bunch of the official art from Dungeon Dice. The art will be available on our website so you can design your own custom mods, expansions, and house rules for Dungeon Dice and the icons on your custom dice will match those on the originals!\n\nWe've also teamed up with Common Man Games to create a custom dice pack for their award winning game Police Precinct. And if enough people are interested in that pack, they'll receive a mystery die for SNITCH Free of charge! That die will also become available for others to claim with their pledge rewards once it's unlocked. More details on Update #8. Both Police Precinct and SNITCH are available through their current KS project.\nWith the announcement of full-color printing, we also announced a collaboration with Nick Hayes to bring his game Chunky Fighters to the masses.\nTesh of Project Khopesh ran a successful Kickstarter project several months ago for metal Tinker Dice and would like to see those designs made reality in plastic as well. So he has shared with us the designs for d6 Tinker Dice as well as Fudge Tinker Dice. Here's what the design looks like as well as a picture of the finished product in metal.\nWe've teamed up with Sarcastic Robot to make Firewall, a strategy dice game, available.\nP.D. Magnus is working with us to produce dice featuring the suits of his award winning six suit deck of cards, the Decktet.\nCheck out Update #11 for a much fuller list of collaborations.\nThese are just a handful of those that have shown us their designs. And there are many more of our 1,000+ backers with design ideas they haven't shown us.\nThese designs will all be available when the project gets funded, but what should be even more exciting is not the designs I've created, but the opportunity for ANYONE to create their own custom design and make it available to the world. There are literally infinite possibilities. I hope the few I've posted here can help inspire some ideas.\nShipping: Shipping to the US is included with all reward levels, additional $7 required for international shipping.\nSharing is caring! One of the most critical aspects of making this project a success is getting the word out to everyone that might be interested. But we need your help to do it.\n\nIf you help us out by sharing the project URL on Facebook or including it in one of your Tweets, we'll reward all of our backers by unlocking new colors of paint to fill the designs with. We figure this is better than paying for advertising because it allows us to reward even more for your support!\n\nWhile you're at it, feel free to follow us on Twitter @CustomGameLab and like our fanpage on Facebook:\nJust for clarification, these are not new colors of dice, but new colors of paint to fill the engraved designs with. New colors of dice will be unlocked through monetary stretch goals.\nDesigns we can promise to be available upon success of this project, include the following themes: Promo dice, Elvish script, weapons, winner's dice, loser's dice, tetrominoes, moon phases, standard d6, dragon dice, chess dice, ninja dice, card suit dice, crown and anchor dice, fudge dice (standard and outline), text based dice, cheater's dice, binary dice, weather dice, Mayan dice, Emoticon dice, Chinese dice, Roman numeral dice, hexadecimal color choosing dice, RGB color choosing dice, and math constants dice.

Players compete to slay the most monsters or eat the most knights. Monsters & Knights is fantasy themed hand management, trick taking game, similar to classic card games like pitch or spades.\nTo summarize the game play: There are two ways to play monsters and knights, casual mode, and advanced mode. \nIn the casual mode of monsters and knights, each round players will play all the cards in their hand, using monsters/knights to eat/slay other monsters and knights already in play. At the end of the round they will add up the points for their slayed monsters, or eaten knights and continue to play rounds until one player or team reaches a set number of points.\nThe advanced mode of monsters and knights adds additional game play mechanics enhancing the level of strategy for players looking for a more complex game. \nWatch a How to play video for Monsters & Knights:\nPLAY\n\n(How to play video features a prototype game, actual game will have a different back image)\n Monsters & Knights reviewed by Dave at To The Table:\n ^(note: Dave is using a print and play version of the game)\ncRAZYjOESgAMES is an independent game publisher/designer. Currently my focus is to design table top games. Growing up  I spent a lot of time at hobby shops and bookstores playing table top games. There is a social quality to playing games at a table that develops communication skills that differs from playing a video game. I appreciate that aspect and want to create quality table top games so others can enjoy this unique experience. If at any time I use the words our or we, I'm referring to the people who have supported me and helped get crazyjoesgames where it is today.\nWhy Kickstarter? Monsters and Knights has been fully developed and play tested and now I would like to print a first run and distribute the game to people who enjoy table top games. The initial goal will be a 200 copy print run. This is my first experience with running a Kickstarter, ultimately my goal is to print and ship as many copies to backers as possible. If the campaign over funds, I will look into a larger print run to meet the needs of the backers.\nWhy The Game Crafter?  TGC is more than capable of handling high volume, quality manufacturing. More than anything TGC is good people. They are a great company to work with, their product is well made, and being in the US makes shipping much easier.\n A word from the artist:\nBoardgamegeek page: http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/154527/monsters-knights", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nMy wrist still hurts from operating the puppet.

The the extra money will be used to make enhancements to the sterilizer system and improve the production capacity of our facility!\n$24,000: Kickstarter video outtakes! We have a lot of funny/embarrassing footage that we don't really want to share,but we will with a certain persuasion...\n$28,000:  Free pound of mushrooms for all of our backers!\nUnless you're not able to come to the Twin Cities, then you'll get spawn to inoculate and grow mushrooms from a log or wood chips at your home!\nABOUT US\nMississippi Mushrooms is an urban mushroom farm in Minneapolis, MN. We have been growing fungi since 2012, and in May of 2013 we moved into a new facility in NE Minneapolis. Year-round we grow some of the best mushrooms found anywhere in the world, including species that are not suited to the harsh Minnesota climate.  \nOur facility has been built to support the production of a wide range of fungi, and as we grow we will continue to introduce more exciting species that are not available anywhere else.\nWhile we currently produce roughly 100lbs. per week, with your support we will soon increase production to over 500lbs. of super fresh and profoundly local mushrooms each week! This level of production means that you will be able to find our mushrooms at local grocery stores, co-ops, farmer's markets, food trucks and restaurants all across the Twin Cities!\nTHE RECYCLING POWER OF FUNGUS\nFungi are under-utilized and amazing organisms. In growing edible mushrooms we are using fungi to catalyse the conversion of complex organic materials into food.\nPerhaps the most unique aspect of our farm is the way we grow mushrooms: we use carefully selected waste byproducts sourced from companies here in the Twin Cities! These include sawdust and spent brewer's grain (see: Wood from the Hood & Boom Island Brewing).  If we didn't use these materials they might go to an incinerator or landfill, but once we collect them they have a bright future and become produce and compost! As the fungi degrade the complex molecules found in sawdust and brewer's grain they produce rich and partially degraded organic matter as a byproduct.  Our compost is some of the best available and adds organic matter that increases the productivity of soils. https://www.kickstarter.com/help/statsIt is available to the general public and is used by gardeners and landscapers alike!\nYet this is only a small aspect of the many amazing and under-appreciated abilities fungi possess. The installation of a retort will also enable Mississippi Mushrooms to begin work on bio-remediation and green-building-material products. These other applications are possible due to the unique properties of mycelia, the cellular network that all fungi possess.\nWHAT IS A RETORT?\nWe are raising funds to install a retort, and it is the last piece of equipment we are missing to complete our growing system. A retort is essentially a large pressure cooker that uses steam to sterilize substrate materials in bulk. It will allow us to dramatically increase production by increasing batch size and improving the sterility of our clean room. Growing these organisms at this capacity requires careful sterile conditions to avoid growing the ubiquitous microorganisms in our environment (imagine what happens to ageing fruit).\nThis particular retort has two doors which allow for an ideal clean product flow: raw materials are loaded from the general room and \u201ccooked\u201d, then the sterile substrate is transferred into the clean room where it is not exposed contaminating microorganisms.\nTHE FUNGAL LIFE-CYCLE AT OUR FACILITY\nWe have put together the sterile equipment, laboratory and environmental controls that allow us to work with fungi with great precision regardless of the weather. Contrary to popular belief we do not begin with spores, rather fungi start as tissue cultures on malt & agar in a petri dish.\nAs the mycelium grow we transfer them onto sterilized woody materials which are a food source for fungi. \nWith the right environmental conditions (high humidity, controlled temperature and air exchange) the fungi \"fruit\" and produce mushrooms. We have four environmentally controlled chambers with the ability to provide these conditions.\nAfter fruiting the fungi are transferred to the compost, where the already partially decomposed material is further degraded.\nHOW WILL WE USE THE CAMPAIGN FUNDS?\nA breakdown of how we will use the funds from this campaign together with the Value Added Grant we have received from the MN Department of Agriculture.\nInstall floor drain, roof vents & high temperature sprinkler head: $2,000\nPurchase double-door retort and necessary parts:  $10,000\n20 boiler horse power high pressure steam boiler: $10,000\nShip retort and boiler to Minneapolis: $1,500\nAdditional steam equipment (valves, traps, pipe etc.): $3,000\nInstallation of steam system by licensed & insured steam fitter: $7,000\n Engineer and city permit fees: $1,500\n\nTotal cost: $35,000 - $10,000(Value added grant) = $25,000\nThe remainder of the cost not covered by Kickstarter or the grant will be paid by Mississippi Mushrooms.\nWHERE CAN YOU FIND US?\nCheck out this list on our website to find our products near you!\nYour support will make this project possible.

However, if we had to produce all of them today, we couldn't. Succeeding in this project of installing a retort is the solution to the biggest challenge we currently face: limited production due to small batch size and contamination by unwanted microbes.\n\nIn order to help our backers with potential availability concerns we will maintain live updates of reward availability on our website/social media, and availability information will also be accessible via phone. This way we can make sure that no one will come out to meet us at the farmer's market only to discover that we have already sold out!\n\nOnce installed the retort will quickly begin to produce higher yields and we will immediately begin to distribute the rewards.

Below is our original Kickstarter campaign, updated to reflect the latest.\nTHE SAND STORM (\u6c99\u5c18\u66b4) is a dystopian science fiction film set in the not-too-distant future. It is a low-fi sci-fi short, made in China, telling the story of a city on the brink of a water shortage through the eyes and interactions of four main characters: a woman, a man, a lover, and a water smuggler.\nHELLO, PEOPLE OF KICKSTARTER!\nMy name is Jason and for the longest time I wanted to make my own films, so I left my job and my home to fly from New York to a city I\u2019d never been to before, Beijing. I chose China for creative solitude because I\u2019m easily distracted and had heard the Internet would be blocked for me, perfect for writing. Next thing you know \u2026\nI\u2019M FINISHING A MOVIE CALLED THE SAND STORM \nBeijing felt like the future, not cool and sleek (that\u2019s Shanghai) but dim and gritty. \nThe story centers around human dramas within a city in turmoil.\nIt was the start of 2013, and all of China was about to shut down for the holidays. We had two weeks exactly to assemble our cast and crew or we would be forced into production limbo indefinitely. The weather fell below freezing and on a scale of 1-500 (smoggy days in Los Angeles register 60-90), pollution indexes hit a record 800. This was the climate in which we operated. \nWe shot under extreme circumstances, entirely in Chinese, independent all the way. No fundraising, just us. Eventually, we started crowd funding. Then we stopped. Then we started again.\nWHY KICKSTARTER? WHY NOW? WHY $33,000?\nOur plan has always been to release the finished film online, for free, to the world, but we need to pay for it.\nWe wanted roll-out of the movie to be as much of a revelation as possible so we agreed to delay crowdfunding until after we wrapped.  \nNOW WE NEED YOU because to finish the film, pay back everyone, and break even would require over 300% of our initial ask but, honestly, anything helps. Shutting down early would have stopped us cold in our tracks and left people unpaid. Restarting for less than a week means we have a unique opportunity to build a critical mass, together.\nWHAT IF WE EXCEED OUR KICKSTARTER GOAL?\nTHAT WOULD BE AMAZING!! If you fund this project beyond $33k, you\u2019ll help cover our remaining production expenses.\nNEW : Our first stretch goal was 1000 supporters, our second $88k, now it's how many people can come on board. Can we reach 2000?\nWe still have hard costs related to visual effects, sound design, music, mix, color correction, subtitles, festival submission fees, and \u2026 is your head spinning, too? Every contribution counts. Even now.\nWe went at it alone, building sets, renting equipment, hiring a local cast and crew \u2026 some payments were deferred, others covered by short-term loans.\nFINISHING THE SAND STORM\nThere won\u2019t be any WARS OVER WATER for at least a decade but this film can be ready in a matter of weeks.\nSo many wonderful people have helped make the impossible possible. Incredibly talented industry professionals (not just in Beijing, but in London, Shanghai, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and New York, with credits ranging from \u201cThe Hobbit\u201d to \u201cLost in Translation\u201d) are donating their time and resources, scrambling to finish so we can project on the big screen at a film festival \u2026 and reach the world online.\nWE RECORDED AN ORIGINAL SCORE with a 28-piece string orchestra at London\u2019s landmark Abbey Road, a studio kept historically and acoustically identical to when the Beatles last used it. One performer (pictured) is playing the viola from \u201cEleanor Rigby\u201d (sitting somewhere in the middle). We\u2019ll be sharing more details in a future update.\nNEW : As an additional thank you, all supporters of THE SAND STORM (all of you!) will receive a free digital download of the latest album by Philip Sheppard, our film\u2019s composer. He's collaborated in the past with James Lavelle, Jarvis Cocker, Jimmy Page, David Bowie (who\u2019s name may not begin with the letter J but who\u2019s real last name does: it\u2019s Jones), and conducted for the Olympic Games (Beijing and London). Hope you like it!\nALL THIS FOR A TEN MINUTE FILM?\nYes. \nYOUR CONTRIBUTION MEANS SO MUCH\nWe kept our production discreet and for over a year told no one what we were up to \u2026 then we teased without spoiler alerts, mainly with backstage photos and clips from the cutting room floor \u2026 expect to see more during our final five days.\nYour support has made it all worthwhile.\nThanks (in advance, even for reading this far), and at the risk of sounding like every other Kickstarter campaign, we\u2019re giving away special gifts connected with the project: SUPER ARTSY REWARDS \u2026 custom action figures (!!!) \u2026 access to behind-the-scenes footage \u2026 still frames \u2026 and other surprises. Hair.\nOUR ULTIMATE GOAL IS TO ENTERTAIN\nEven today, water shortages, poor air quality, and information obstruction exist around the world. These complex issues provide the backdrop for an open-ended story, and our art house sci-fi short is the set-up for more to come (perhaps an eventual full-length feature film). But first, we need to finish the short.\nWhatever\u2019s next, it's going to be awesome, especially if we go at it together. We hope you will join in our adventure as we wrap and release THE SAND STORM.\n\u2013 \u2013 Thank you! \u2013 \u2013\nJason Wishnow and the entire \u6c99\u5c18\u66b4 Team", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nTHE GOOD NEWS is we\u2019ve already wrapped principle photography (unusual for a lot of movies on Kickstarter) meaning the hard part is over. But we\u2019re not done yet. It\u2019s no longer a question of WHETHER we finish the film, but WHEN we finish, and that part is up to you! (UPDATE: release and reward delivery dates may be pushed slightly. We will keep you informed.)\n\nSpeaking of risks and challenges\u2026\n\nI OWE AN APOLOGY. Our Kickstarter campaign is back after vanishing for a month and I must navigate the choppy waters of crafting a singular explanation for both an audience of one in China and many others elsewhere in the world.\n\nDEAR AI WEIWEI: Recently, I erred as if THE SAND STORM (\u6c99\u5c18\u66b4) was an average project with average players, even though everything about it was extraordinary. I see how my actions could be perceived as disrespectful to your status as a world-class artist, supporter of the arts, and human rights defender. Your image and identity are precious, so I should have known better than to take at face value an early conversational nod on your part to make and market this movie as I saw fit. Promoting your involvement in the film while failing to fully include you in our Kickstarter preparations was careless. You demonstrated foresight and fortitude by stopping the fundraising campaign before it may have potentially wreaked damage to your public image, and for that I am humbled. Thank you for taking time, earlier this month when I visited, to speak with me about it and for all your previous encouragement with the film. Ai Weiwei, it has been an honor to work beside you and Du Ke Feng \u2013 I can imagine no greater artistic and cinematic Dream Team. My intent was to honor you, not exploit you. Despite missteps in fundraising strategy, I hope you might renew your faith in this project, but more than that, I hope you will find it in your heart to forgive me and to consider me your friend. I continue to admire you tremendously, as a person, as a creator, and as a crusader of art and justice. \u8c22\u8c22\u60a8\n\nTO EVERYONE ELSE: Your encouragement has meant the world to me. Thank you. \n\nWhen I finally started talking about THE SAND STORM (\u6c99\u5c18\u66b4), after waiting until we nearly finished the art-house sci-fi short we'd been making in China, it was because I wondered how we might complete it with the same quality we brought to our initial shoot, done under unusual, perhaps extraordinary, circumstances \u2013 for which I already drained my savings and borrowed from close friends. \"If you can launch a Kickstarter campaign within ten days,\" a stranger overhearing my story at a party said to me, \"I'll pitch in your first $5000 because this sounds like a movie worth making.\"\n\nTwo thousand supporters signed up for the adventure. What started as a dare, fast-tracked to one of the most successful short film campaigns in Kickstarter history \u2013 we might almost break even, and we could at last share our project with the world.\n\nFrom inception, our plan was to release THE SAND STORM online, for free. Crowdfunding made that a real possibility. The majority of backers pledged $11 to watch THE SAND STORM one day in advance plus see their names in the credits, the digital equivalent of lining up for a blockbuster and getting a hug for it. The Guardian wrote: \"far from a Hollywood blockbuster, it is a short film funded by Kickstarter, so it's all very artistically pure.\" The highest compliment. \n\nThe flood of interest in a project we'd kept hidden for so long felt invigorating at first, but then, five days before our scheduled end, the historic campaign went on ice. Why? I alienated the friend and collaborator who inspired it all, and who, up until that point, had been hugely encouraging. Until this happened \u2013 FAST CO. EXIST (April 30).\n\nExcept when we meet in person, Ai Weiwei's studio mediates our correspondence, and I hastily sent advance-links via my usual, casual contacts, rather than his standard channels for such matters, without follow-up on my part, interpreting silence as approval. From our opposite sides of the Great Firewall, things that sometimes seem straightforward can be fraught. Creative endeavors with artistic titans should not be treated lightly. An easily avoidable mistake on my part led to an unpleasant surprise on his: discovering our fundraiser secondhand, through the invasiveness of Google alerts and press inquiries which eclipsed any fun we shared on set. Having waited for a finished film, he instead got chaos coupled with inaccuracies (the distinction of his acting debut belongs not here but to 1993's CCTV series \"A Beijinger in New York\"). How do you say \"I'm sorry\" to the Never Sorry Guy?\n\nThe day after the campaign-freeze, I hopped on a plane to China for a week, we met three times, and he requested I tone down emphasis on him for fundraising purposes.\n\nTo clarify \u2013 he is still in the film, same as ever. Our edit is \"locked\" but because there's more work to do, our release date is in limbo. We've given you our word we will finish THE SAND STORM. And we will. Soon. Movies are meant to be seen.\n\nWhen our campaign went viral to a degree I had only dreamed of for the finished film, I expected the discourse to naturally move away from the topic of celebrity on its own \u2026 but that is not how public conversation works. Nobody needs be singled out as an isolated star: the characters of THE WOMAN, THE MAN, THE LOVER, THE WATER SMUGGLER are equally deserving of recognition, as are each and every member of our expertly talented crew. Now, as we re-launch for five days, let me overtly hijack your focus to a topic far more meaningful, namely, the rise of super-cities and their potential for the decay of health and safety.\n\nThis movie isn't about making a movie star out of an artist \u2014 it\u2019s about making a movie star out of an idea.\n\nSci-fi, as a genre, allows us to speculate about possible future choices, but when the present moves faster than fiction, action is also needed. We shot this short drama with its backdrop of water rationing while on-set pollution levels skyrocketed above international standards for measurement and safety (on a scale of 1-500, smoggy days in Los Angeles registering 60-90, Beijing indexes hit a record 800). The script called for our day players to wear air filter masks to look \"dystopian,\" but the crew wore them as well; we had to. When we edit, I can hear myself coughing on the sound track. This problem is not only endemic to China but in super-cities rising all over the world.\n\nWe hope THE SAND STORM will encourage new conversations about environmental degradation, and how we can create a better future \u2026 but, mostly, entertain.\n\nUntil then, welcome to the *final* final five days of fundraising, another part of our journey \u2013 part of what you get as a supporter of THE SAND STORM (\u6c99\u5c18\u66b4).\n\nJason\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #20", "update_userinfo": "SAND STORM Northern California Screening at The Mendocino Film Festival - This Weekend!", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #19", "update_userinfo": "ANATOMY OF A SHOT (Opening Titles): Creating the Sand Storm Cityscape", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #18", "update_userinfo": "AFTER THE SAND STORM \u2013 #1", "update_content": ""}, {"status": []}], "comment_no": 63, "projec_url": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/wishnow/a-secret-sci-fi-film-shot-in-china-starring-ai-wei", "project_name": "a secret sci-fi film shot in china \u2022 THE SAND STORM (\u6c99\u5c18\u66b4)"}}, {"backer": "Products for Robots", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "PIPERS!

Without any keys, the 3D printed chanter can currently play from low D, all the way up to high B - about the same range as the penny whistle, and comparable to the Uilleann pipes or irish flute!\nThe Scottish Smallpipes are a mellow, indoor kind of bagpipe.\nAs my Kickstarter project moves towards its last week, I'm looking for pipers to sign up as 'Beta Testers' for the extended range chanter. You'll get two copies - one as it stands now, to Beta-test, and one when the design has been fully refined. A reed by Pipe Dreams will also be included.\nI'm not a pipe maker. Rather I'm a piper, who through a longstanding fondness for Smallpipes, and a strong desire to have a greater range of notes, has spent the last four years intensively studying the acoustics of the pipes, and designing & producing prototype instruments\nSpecifically, I'm working on a design for a chanter (melody pipe) for the Scottish Smallpipes, that will play around two octaves, without the use of keys. The conventional range of the instrument is currently nine notes.\nIf this project is successful, I will offer 3D prints of the finished instrument for sale to anyone who would like one. Project backers will of course get a discounted price! Ultimately I would like to cooperate with pipemakers to make the instrument available to the piping and musical community more generally, I've already had preliminary conversations with pipe makers, about translating the design 'into wood'.The basic design is settled, and plays around an octave and a half just now, so I'm looking to fund as many iterations of the design as I can to be 3D printed. I'm looking to stabilise the instrument in the second register, perfect the tuning, improve the tonal colour, and refine a chanter in every pitch that is practical, beginning with 'A', and moving on to 'G', 'Bb', 'C' and 'D'.\n3D printed smallpipe drones\nThe cost of 3D printing isn't cheap, particularly when it comes to the more accurate industrial printers that I've been using, so I'm coming to \"Kickstarter\" to see if I can fund this project to completion. From my experience gathered so far I am able to offer donors a range of 'print-at-home' STL files, as well as a 'ready printed' tried and tested 3D printed 'penny' whistle, and a simple set of traditional parlour pipes. These instruments are printed from original, in-house designs. See the video to get an idea of how the current prototypes sound. The instruments you receive will have undergone a further two to six months of development, and comments and suggestions will be very welcome during this process.\nGoal - \u00a35,000\nThe \u00a35,000 funding I hope to gather is to fund the printing of a series of prototypes of extended range chanters and drones on accurate high-spec commercial printers, and to record an album-length set of recordings of the instrument, playing a selection of music that couldn't previously have been played on Scottish Smallpipes. Guest musicians will be taking part, and names of these musicians will appear on this site as the work progresses.\nStretch Goal 1 - \u00a310,000\nIn addition to the key of A (above) Produce and refine prototype copies of the chanter in the keys of G, Bb, C, D. \nProduce a \"tutor book\" to introduce pipers to the method of playing the new chanter.\nDesign and print a modified 3D printed set of drones to accompany the extended range chanter, giving a true bass drone, a 'bass' drone, a 'baritone' drone and a 'tenor' drone.\n--------------------------------------------------\nIn return, you can choose from rewards including a 3D printed penny whistle, a copy of the new extended range chanter, and a full set of Smallpipes, including the new chanter, in black or white plastic.\nEnquiries from pipe makers, pipers, and any other interested parties, are welcomed.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are few risks to this project. other than those related to the timescales involved. The 3D print firms to be used have been tried and tested to produce chanters and drones of a good quality. The system of testing and development to be used will allow for the instrument to be refined to a very high degree. Accessing the 'low notes' below the existing scale will be a certainty.

Interested yet? Check out why we think P3 is going to rock your world\u2026\nP3 is a fast, narrative and easy to learn roleplaying game; designed to be perfect for younger players, busy Game Masters and newcomers to the hobby!\n The game system is packed away within a short and sweet 65 page full color perfect bound Core Rulebook!\n Features a flexible magic system that encourages creative thought rather than memorization of a spell list.\n Boasts a character creation process designed for better roleplaying and a unique Prophecy mechanic for a fresh take on character development.\nA young sorceress loving the P3 magic system! Art by Tom Kyster\nThe emphasis of P3 is story, story and even more story. The rules and mechanics revolve around this pillar of the game, so players can walk away from the table every game session with stories and memories to share for years to come.\nAs a rules light game system, P3 makes strides in its design so that the fun of roleplaying games is easier to get into for a wider range of people! With an extremely short but concise Core Rulebook, P3 allows new players to quickly jump into the game without an endless amount of rules to have memorized.\nDice: Beyond having the Core Rulebook all players need to play are a handful of dice. In fact it can be any kind of dice! P3 has been purposely designed so players can play with any dice readily available; be they six sided, twenty sided or even a pocket full of coins. On top of that Game Masters in P3 have no need for rolling dice, making their job easier.\nMagic: Too many spells is not always a good thing because too many choices can overwhelm any sort of player! To counteract this, P3 uses a simple and unique magic system that hosts 13 different spell schools for players to choose from. When a player character has knowledge in one of these 13 types of magic they can attempt to cast whatever sort of spell they can imagine that fits within the parameters of the spell schools they are familiar with. Imaginative players can even combine these schools for some pretty darn spectacular results! Altogether the magic system is fluid, fun and allows for spontaneous creativity at the table. Personally I\u2019ve had a blast witnessing players use magic in P3 to influence the environments around them. A great example of this is when an innovative player using the Water School of magic, cast a spell to turn a pond of water into a stairway of ice in order to reach enemies above!\nPLAY\n\nCombat: Without a game board or grid to play on, combat in P3 is described in broad strokes. This way game sessions can run smoothly and the fun can keep on going! With players limited to having only one action per turn, combat moves fast with a success and failure system that allows for interesting events to occur in the heat of battle! In a nut shell P3 allows for martial characters to feel like the heroes within an 80\u2032s action movie!\nA dwarven cleric burns undead with holy magic! Art by Tom Kyster\nPlay How You Want: Although combat is refined to be smooth, quick and awesome: combat is not the definition of P3! Players within P3 are granted talent points to improve their characters not by killing enemies, but by completing game sessions! If by either sneaking, lying, cheating, fighting or talking your way through an adventure, all are justifiable ways to play P3!\nHeroes battle the demon that lairs at the heart of the forest. Art by Tom Kyster\nBecause action follows the heroic characters the players portray, much of P3 is dedicated to the Character Creation System! Designed to be easy-to-learn, the creation process is packed within a single chapter and is classless in nature, allowing players to play the way they want! As a whole the creation process subtly forces players to create characters with detailed backgrounds and personalities that aren't just fluff, but impact their stats in a major way! When determining character choices, players affect a character\u2019s\u2026\nPast and who the character once was. This incorporates where a character comes from, their past social status and what they were skilled in\u2026\nPersona and who the character is. This category of choices includes a character\u2019s mentality, flaw, desire, love and hate\u2026\nPLAY\n\nProphecy: Character customization doesn't end after the player creates their character for play. With the Prophecy mechanic there is no such thing as a static character whose personal story remains the same throughout a campaign! With a simple but fun semi-random mechanic, a character\u2019s prophecy adds story driven ingredients that create group determined destinies for characters that promote change, character development and consequences!\nPLAY\n\nWith the philosophy that gaming is supposed to be a fun activity, P3 is designed to wholeheartedly accommodate Game Masters by making their jobs easy!\nP3 alleviates the juggling act that Game Mastering calls for with a system that prevents the Game Master from rolling dice so his focus can always remain on the story and the fun of the game!\nOn top of that  P3 implements a system for easy NPC(Non-Player Characters) and Threat creation so prepping for a game session is a total breeze and can be done on the fly!\nA party of heroes at audience with a wise ruler. Art by Will Fenholt\nOther than a handful of great board games and RPGs as inspiration, major influences for P3 are primarily the people I have attempted to teach RPGs to. But because the mechanics of my favorite games were difficult to teach to younger siblings and friends alike, I figured RPGs would be more widely accepted if one were to ever be streamlined for ease of use and instant fun.\nAnd although not a game itself, I tend to listen to a great deal of podcasts which eventually led me to listen to an audio segment called \u201cThe Questions Three\u201d from the guys over at the Order 66 Podcast. The segment included three questions for Game Masters to ask their players for better roleplaying during game sessions. These questions included, \u201cwhat does your character love, what do they hate, and for what reason are they adventuring\u201d. Afterwards I sought to have better roleplaying within my own gaming group, but I had a horrible time getting my players to answer these three simple questions. Eventually this desire to have these questions answered led me down a road of events that became the foundation for P3, a game system that implemented these questions in its design.\nDespite the fact that all the work is done creating the game system and writing the Core Rulebook, a lot is still needed to get  P3 going! Ambitious as I am, I lack the ability to create awesome pieces of artwork for the game and require money to compile illustrations needed to make the P3 Core Rulebook really come alive with truly awesome artwork! And heck, I'm pretty young, hard working and well...a student, this doesn't really translate into a rich and comfortable lifestyle. As such, I need some help funding this awesome project and that is why I have come to Kickstarter!\nAs a kid, I was sold into the whole D&D concept immediately after I left the theaters having seen the Lord of the Rings. The next day I recall getting my hands on the 3.5 Dungeons and Dragons Player\u2019s Handbook in some dirty old game store in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Throughout the remainder of my childhood I remember pouring hours of time simply looking through various rule books, captivated by all of the radical artwork within!\nFor this reason, I believe that artwork is a powerful force that can potentially allure newcomers into gaming and can inspire existing gamers. For this reason the greatest portion of the Kickstarter funds are to be dedicated for the sole purpose of commissioning additional artwork for the Core Rulebook itself.\n Beyond acquiring artwork necessary for filling the Core Rulebook with really cool illustrations, funding is required to print the initial books provided by the rewards levels during the Kickstarter campaign and to constitute the shipping prices to deliver the books themselves. Heck on top of that the funding goal has been set at its level to additionally necessitate the 5% of the total funding that Kickstarter withdraws as part of their fee and the extra 3-5% that is given to Amazon Payments as part of their transaction service.\n$9,000- Chapter Images: At this stretch goal the P3 Core Rulebook will feature seven new pen & ink illustrations for each chapter cover page in the book.\n$9,100- Kindle Conversion: The P3 Core Rulebook will be converted and formatted for the Kindle device.\nSo you like what you see, but want more?

All we ask in return is that you help spread the word about this exciting game arriving on Kickstarter in Mid-April!\n** All reward levels have been scaled to reflect pricing in USD **\nFrom designer Francois Valentyne ( Give It to the King!, Ticket to Ride: Legendary Asia & Chaos) comes Gone Viking, an epic trick-taking card game in which you strive to become the wealthiest Viking!.\nThank the Gods! Another successful raiding voyage! You will be seen as heroes to return home with so many spoils. But one big problem awaits. You and all the other Viking lords have sworn fealty to a chieftain who takes, by right, half your wealth when you go viking and return with plunder. Thankfully, this Jarl only targets the one among you who has gained the most, the one he fears the most. If you acquire and hold on to the most Wealth and overcome all opposition, you will become the next great chieftain and win the game!\nAs a player in Gone Viking, you will try to become the richest Viking by collecting Wealth tokens. Which type of token you get depends on the type of Plunder card you use to win the trick. But after each raid, the Jarl will grab his share from the one Viking who has the most. Should you acquire the right combination of tokens, you can trade them in for a Viking ship that the Jarl can't take from you. Using the power of the Viking gods will truly add to your success. Each suit in Gone Viking has a god associated with it, who also has its own unique affect on the game play (as described below).\nA unique aspect and one of the major mechanics and strategic elements in Gone Viking is the placement of the gods and how to use their powers to your advantage at the most opportune moments.  Having played a god card at the right part of the game is the real meat behind becoming the richest Viking.\nThese cards have two effects: they affect the way tricks are won during a raid, and bestow a post-raid benefit for the card's owner.\nAnother cool element of Gone Viking is the fact that you are not limited to only playing one card per turn!\n..Wait?.. ... What?...\nYes that\u2019s right, cards of the same suit can be played\u2026.AT THE SAME TIME\u2026 to add to make one super-valuable card\u2026 but watch out, you may not have enough cards at the end of the round to take part in every trick !\nNot sure what exactly a Jarl is?  The equivalent to \"Earls\" in early Scandanavian languages, Jarls were members of noble families during the time of the Vikings.  They ruled over the lands and most definitely played by their own rules. Nothing scared a Jarl more than having one of his subjects end up wealthier than he. \nTo Read More on Jarls Click Here\n\"This Jarl is one Nasty Dude\"  -- Lots of Scared Viking Raiders\nThere are many stretch goals to come, lets get this thing funded first :)\nWhy Kickstarter?\nWe are back due to the success of our campaign for Give It to the King!

Utilizing the Unity3D engine, Wishful Lie is a unique combination of run-and-hide horror with mind-bending puzzle solving.\nIn this world, you get to switch between two characters on command and the world around you changes depending on the character you are currently controlling. This allows you to face every challenge posed to you in your own creative style.\nA little history; Wishful Lie began as a student project titled Forget Me Not Annie back in 2012 with a team of 4 over 3 months. When the project had finished, we posted it online for our friends and families. Yet a month or two later to our surprise we discovered that the game had over 100,000 downloads throughout the web, we were receiving fan messages and fan art, and it had hundreds if not thousands of Let's Play / Walk Through videos all over YouTube! So, we decided to roll with the momentum and here we are, asking you guys to help us complete the original vision of the game as a full feature length title.\nThe story revolves around a schizophrenic and delusional teenage girl name Lilly and her splinter personality that has manifested into a human size grotesque teddy bear named Howard. The duo travels between an asylum, a nearby town, her childhood school and home all the while facing a world that constantly changes due to her powerful hallucinations. As their journey continues, Lilly will eventually stumble upon and discover the horrific truth about her past, the reason for her illness and the reason for the birth of her best and most deadly delusion; Howard.\nThe world within Wishful Lie is a living being that parallels the hallucinations suffered by Lilly. As the you progress through the game, NPC's that you meet, places that you visit and even events that defeats you will change the world in a variety of ways. \nSo, for example: At a hospital junction, you decide to go down the hallway that leads to the criminally insane, and at the end you meet a prolific serial killer of the time and he tells you a story about his greatest murders. After which, a nurse walks into the room and discovers you and there for sends you back to the start of the game. However, this does NOT mean you have simply restarted. Instead, after having that encounter and hearing that story, the world has adapted and changed where new objects will appear which can include anything from secret notes and messages to fatal encounters with the re-animated victims of the murderer.\n Below you can see two of the most popular Let's Play videos of our demo title, Forget Me Not Annie. In addition, we are also receiving support/testimonial videos from our fans and supporters which we will include in this section soon!\n http://kickingitforward.org", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nFinancial Risk: We have already invested a ton of time and our own money into the development of the game, and are fully prepared to do whatever is necessary to reach completion. All we need now is your support so that we may have a small living allowance and a little bit more run way to finish the game. We can do it with your help!\n\nSchedule Risk: The completion date for the game is based upon our development time with the demo version where as we mentioned above, took 3 months and half the time we had to be in class. As such, we are more than confident we can accomplish this goal and offer you guys an extremely polished experience within our development time. Should some features take longer than expected to implement, there is a chance that the completion date will change, but only by a thin few weeks.

I don't mind saying that it features the most brutal, jarring, fine-grained, frighteningly playable combat I have ever seen at a role-playing table. At first, the game looks like a fairly traditional tabletop RPG build, with GM, players, dice, and so on, but I've knocked every turnbuckle of this sort of play sideways with extremely consequential mechanics twists.\nA Circle knight (art: Amos Orion Sterns)\nYou play members of the Circle, who defy both sides of the destructive war between Amboriyon (blinding inhuman virtue) and Rbaja (reeking demonic corruption), by using both kinds of magic in balance. Some details:\nA thrown spear, or charging into one, goes right through mail, so look out.\nBrace yourself for human horror. It's a time when torture is ordinary, power is almost entirely determined by immediate ruthlessness, food and shelter are more important than money, and no one knows the first thing about hygiene, long-term agriculture, geography beyond the immediate area, or history besides vague legends.\nBlack magic is called Rbaja, and in its extreme form, taints and scorches the landscape into stinking pestholes filled with undead.\nWhite magic is called Amboriyon, and in its extreme form, gathers in clouds from which angelic beings descend and lead people into what looks like virtue \u2013 until it \"enlightens\" them into amorally perfect form or even erases them from reality.\nYou play characters who've banded together to support the young king in Rolke, who opposes both kinds of magic, and you are not only a bad-ass trained fighter no matter what your social background and prior life, but you use both kinds of magic at once. This group is called the Circle \u2013 it's the only one.\nIn a culture based mainly on personal confrontation and immediate connections, one might commit murder and grin one's way out of retribution, but there's no way to stop a mob from killing you, outside of magic.\nFighting and other dynamic conflicts are organized by \"clashes,\" a system that emphasizes simultaneity yet preserves individual, make-or-break actions.\nA killed Circle member becomes a wraith and still participates in the current adventure, but is gone after that adventure's conclusion.\nMost monsters are manifestations of Amboriyon or Rbaja. Creatures of Amboriyon are unbearably pure avatars or destructively wise eidolons; creatures of Rbaja are foul, all too cunning undead or insane, disturbing demons.\nClick on the image for the entire list of everything about the game in one insane data-dump. Please read: this game is exceptionally harsh in its setting and in its presentation. I acknowledge here that the text may trigger trauma. Play itself is not directed toward this end, nor are the setting's nastier features obliged to be included or depicted during play at all. As this is a playtesting draft, I am still developing the right way to discuss both the setting and the procedures of play. This writing (3-22-14) has undergone the first steps based on reader feedback, but it has a long way to go. Your thoughts are welcome.\nEmblem of the Circle (design by Amos Orion Sterns)\nFunding\nThis project is about getting Circle of Hands into exquisite shape. The playtest PDF is available right here and now for free, and with no special effort, I could produce and sell it as a rather plain book tomorrow. However, with funding in hand, the book will be full-sized (8.5\"x11,\" 200+ pages) and gorgeously illustrated by Phillip Simpson, Juan Ochoa, Tony Dowler, Amos Orion Sterns (Lamentations of the Flame Princess, Isle of the Unknown), and Dyson Logos - over 40 pieces of outstanding original work. You can pledge to get it as PDF or PDF+book, softcover or hardcover, and there you go.\nAn old fortress in Rolke (art: Dyson Logos)\n There's also the one and only stretch goal, as described to backers in Update #6 at $6000 and unlocked at $7,500.\nBut there's a lot more you can participate in, to be part of the process instead of just ordering a book. If you're a backer, you can be a final-stage playtester for Circle of Hands, using the basic document right here. No extra pledging required, just play & report. I'll acknowledge you in the book, where it applies, right there at the rule that you've influenced.\nIf you want to suggest more extensive material to include and don't mind doing some good work, pledge at the Inner Circle level, and we'll do a hangout or phone conversation to hash out the details - your work will enter the text directly, acknowledged both in that spot and in the main credits as a contributing author.\nConcept sketches (art by Juan Ochoa)\nA hobby of equals\nIn my weird little mind, Circle of Hands is part of a larger Heartbreaker Redemption effort. I coined the term  \"fantasy heartbreaker\" in 2002.They used to be really common: games bursting at the seams with naive ambition and vision, but hamstrung by limited assumptions. To read more about that, check out my two essays here. Circle of Hands is itself re-imagined and re-designed from my early 90s manuscript called Gray Magick. I dug it up, played it again, discovered what I was excited about, embraced it, and re-designed it to make that happen. I've changed everything, but somehow, only brought that much more of Gray Magick into the spotlight. You'll see this yourself because the original manuscript is scanned into the book, and some of the best stuff was already in there.\nOther game designers have embarked on their own redemptive projects, perhaps to be published someday as well. I'm offering a friendly, non-binding imprint we're all using, with the only requirement being to include the original work.\nPaul Czege's In a Dimension Syncopatic with Ours\nNathan Paoletta's Kildarrin: Role-playing in a Doomed City \nAaron Kesher's Mansion \nMatt Snyder's Numina \nRalph Mazza's Gemini\nGordon R. Landis' World of Bith\u00eb\nand the original Gray Magick\nHeartbreaker Redemption logo draft by Nathan Paoletta\nYou can help by adding $25 to your pledge. This money goes toward a webpage at Adept Press featuring the following games, interviews with the designers, playtesting, a promotional venue for them, networking for professional production help, and promotion of the imprint.\nAnd! If you look at these and say, \"Hey, I wrote a thing like that! It's in that cardboard shirt box!\" then this same additional $25 also adds you to the list! Send me a message to let me know; it must provide a link to material we can see.\nBeing on the list carries no obligation. No one is promising anyone a finished game, merely the fun of playtesting and designing among like-minded individuals with some dedicated webspace. If you do publish, though, and include the original work, then the Heartbreaker Redemption logo is available to you.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIt is sad to see sour endings to well-supported crowdfunding projects. Meltdowns, silences, admissions of vanished funds ... it makes me feel bad for everyone. Making sure this doesn't happen is serious business.\n\nSince 2001, I've published, myself, with no venture capital and without relying on creative outsourcing, twelve books for seven games. I know a thing or two about successfully getting games designed, printed, and into people's hands. For me, crowdfunding isn't about whether the book is published, but how nicely and with how much community enthusiasm and input.\n\nI think crowdfunding requires special commitment to the backers. I'm being most tactical about production choke-points this time. I'm committing to playtesting and writing until August 1, then entering final layout and production until printing in mid-November. Both deadlines are intentionally generous based on my prior publishing history for a project at this stage. Layout delays are always the biggest hurdle, so I've set up the template first, and that's done as shown in the playtest file.

She watches the tides in sunstruck dreams of an empty shore, patiently waiting for her life to end.\nAlone in a skyless and desolate labyrinth-city , there isn't much else to do.\nBut then...\nSo, here's the general idea:\nChallenging gameplay. Hectic combinations of environmental hazards, platforming, and lethal enemies reward players who assess, strategize, and stay attentive. \nMindful level design. The player's experience is managed by a carefully-paced series of dangers and savepoints.\nA somber and expansive open-world connecting many areas in a network of pathways and shortcuts. Hidden areas and optional content encourage exploration.\nHand drawn cut-scenes help illustrate the vast and desolate setting of the game.\nA \"module-based\" character progression system. Players obtain and arrange upgrade pieces on a grid in configurations of their preference, with certain patterns granting additional abilities or bonuses.\nPlayers who die in-game die in real life.\nCentral concepts:\nSun Rooms (Savepoints) - \"Blindspots for hostile machines, sun rooms are found throughout the city--their presence unexplained. True sunlight is not found within the city, but as long as one has faith, it is sufficient.\"\nField of View - The camera swivels towards the player's direction of view. Combined with a default binocular item which moves the camera, the player is encouraged to manage and anticipate distant danger as well as dangers near, but out of frame.\nPulser - Primary weapon. Fire off signal pulses which trigger switches or create explosive bursts for close-up attacks. Upgradable to damaging projectiles, navigable projectiles, and more.\n(Continued):\nDriver - A multipurpose dash skill. Jump out of the way of ranged and melee attacks, leap over bottomless pits to engage in platforming, or charge towards an enemy during an opening. Upgradeable to feature extended duration, momentum canceling, or ruthless bashing.\nShields - Shields are indispensable tools which enable the player to strafe creatively and survive even amidst a harrowing bulletstorm. The direct-charge shield nullifies frontal damage and fizzles away when overstressed. The alternating-charge shield, obtained in later stages of the game, changes polarity depending on the player's up-down/left-right orientation.\nNightmare - Unwholesome event.\nDaybreak\nBlackout\nRotary\nSunlight\nSpent Greens\nQ> What's this all about?\nI blended classic Zelda and dark science fiction and drank the ensuing mixture. It was Radio the Universe.\nPlayers will feel aesthetic and gameplay influences from titles like Yume Nikki, Symphony of the Night, Hotline Miami, and Dark Souls, with a tinge of 2D JRPGs thrown into the mix.\nRtU is a challenging and atmospheric sci-fi game with SNES-style visuals and a sinister, offbeat narrative.\nQ> What's the funding for again?\n7-10 percent immediately goes to Kickstarter and Amazon for whatever their nefarious purpose. A slice goes towards hiring vocals for some of the game's music and sound. Another slice goes towards hiring dedicated game testers. Most of it is to enable 24/7 work on the game for the duration of the planned development timeline--after taxes, of course.\nThe game will take -16,777,216 years to complete.\nQ> What happens if you meet your goal?\nWith the funding, the basic game will be completed for PC.\nThe current development plan allocates ~1.5 months per general area. I'll be sticking to monthly deadlines and keeping a solid 40-hour-a-week schedule. I'll do my best to keep everyone updated.\nIt will be a dense game, designed to be a satisfactory challenge for as diverse a skill level spectrum as possible. If you're exceedingly bad at video games, then consult your video games doctor. You can also wait for a nearby star to perish and automatically win the game. It's in the code.\nQ> What happens if you exceed your goal?\nAdditional funding will primarily be used to expand game content and add additional areas. It may also buy me enough time and/or hired help in order to move the project to a different engine or a custom engine (possibly in Java, performance willing) which supports platforms other than Windows.\nQ> What happens if you don't meet your goal?\nI'll cry softly over my design notes, my heart rendered unmendable thereafter.\nQ> Anything else?\nWith Radio the Universe, I want to create something beautiful, melancholy, and evocative. A game that, of course, is fun to play, but also imparts a special, maybe surreal, experience to the player. I want to make a game with personality. A game that can feel a bit \"off\".\nI'm hopeful that there are enough people out there who want to see \"off\" happen.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThen there's this to consider.\n\nEverything that can be planned now has been planned. I have the necessary software and hardware and resources and skillsets to make this game a reality. I even have some content made (as you've already seen).

I love that I can often play through one in under an hour--simple, challenging, and satisfying! Those games were short by necessity, but brevity IS the soul of wit, and it's not a bad way to do things.\nInspired by SF and Fantasy pulp stories, Tiny Barbarian is made up of individual episodes that, combined, offer a huge amount of content, but individually can be completed in under an hour, while still offering an exciting and complete experience. And we're not asking you to pay individually for a series of episodes. Nope! Buy in once and you'll receive each episode as soon as it is complete!\nHere's some more clips of the game in action:\nThe original Tiny Barbarian was a tiny but very well-received Game Maker project I put out last year. This new version is All New and makes use of Starquail's custom 2D engine - the same engine that powered Astroman on XBox Indie. I received a lot of enthusiastic feedback, and thanks to that feedback, the new engine, and my own determination for improvement, the new game darn near destroys the old one (but you can still get it here, if you like).\nTiny Barbarian now has a much improved combat system that makes juggling enemies a breeze, they can even be knocked into each other for extra damage. TinyB himself is completely redrawn, just as tiny but even more ripped with low-def muscle, and with new moves to attack enemies from different directions (the elbo drop is my favorite). As with the original, the stories are heavily inspired by old Sword & Sorcery yarns (think Conan the Barbarian) with plenty of nods that genre fans (and old-school gamers) are sure to appreciate.\nThis Kickstarter concerns a PC version of the game only, but other platform releases may become feasible later on.\n\nHere are some things you will be able to do in Tiny Barbarian DX, in no particular order (spoilers, obviously):\nFight endless hordes of evil (or just misguided) warriors.\nWack a gnome until gold comes out.\nFlee from a giant serpent.\nDefeat a huge, fire-breathing parrot.\nRide a bumblebee.\nAscend a wizard's magical tower.\nSave the most beautiful ladies that can fit into a 16x16 pixel box.\nBite a vulture.\nEnd the reign of snake-worshiping cultists.\nOutsmart a puma made of liquid metal.\nBattle white apes on an airship.\nEat chicken you found in the garbage.\nCountless exploits that defy description!\nBig, small, or even tiny, making a video game is a significant undertaking. I should know, I've been working on Tiny Barbarian in my free time for months! So why Kickstarter? Well, I could start tiny - finish a single episode and see how it flies. But with your support through Kickstarter, I can work on the project full-time, commit to multiple episodes right away, and you'll get to play them much more quickly. Currently four episodes are planned, but extra pledges will mean additional episodes, \u201cStretch Goal\u201d style.\nBehind every retro sword-wielding barbarian action game is an retro action game fan. I'm Michael Stearns, and I'm the guy behind this one. My friend and programming genius Daniel Roth and I have been producing games under the StarQuail brand for several years now. Our last game, Astroman, was honored by Game Developer Magazine as one of 2010's top ten XBLI titles. Usually I'm the art guy and he's the programming guy, but for Tiny Barbarian, I'm both guys, although he continues to assist me (willing or not!) whenever I need a bit of expert advice. I'm also the creator of the webcomic Dawn of Time, which ran consistently--and received praise from an amazing number of complete strangers--between 2008 and 2011.\nJoining me is Jeff Ball, the super-talented musician who worked with us to create the soundtrack for Astroman, as well as the music for the original TinyB. He has worked on other titles such as Monkey Island 2: Special Edition, Wing Commander Saga, and contributed his violin mastery to triple-A titles such as Mass Effect 3, Gears of War 3, League of Legends, and others.\nAbout Rewards!\nMost of the rewards are pretty self-explanatory but I want to describe or show a few in detail. \nThe Game: The game itself is the most basic reward, and with digital delivery, getting it to you is a snap! Backers will receive the first chapter (almost done!) and each additional chapter as it is completed. The delivery date displayed in the Rewards List is for the total project, so you will be playing the game long before date shown. Also, your name will appear in the Hall of Heroes, an in-game monument to my Kickstarter backers.\nSample box. The finished product may differ (it'll have a proper blurb on the back, too!)\nThe DVD Box Edition: This special box edition includes your digital download, the box with artwork, and a short booklet with cool artwork and a totally unnecessary (but also Totally Necessary!) guide to getting started. The box edition does not include a physical copy of the game, but it's a fantastic thing to have on your shelf.\nThe Shirt: Trade in those barbaric scraps for something more civilized!  If you think it looks good here, think how good it will look... ON YOU.\nTiny buttons: Any reward tier that has stuff shipped to you will also have a set of five shiny, shiny 1\" buttons shipped to you along with it!  Each assortment will include a varied selection of the game's cast but you can always count on getting one pixellated barbarian hero.\n\"Keeper of Terrible Secrets:\" This is the big one! I'll hide an Easter Egg in the game based on an idea of your choosing. It might be a secret room devoted to your greatness, or it might be a unique, game-breaking mount! The ideas come from you but I'll be the one who determines how it actually appears in the game. Anyone playing the game can access these Easter Eggs, but only you will know how to do it--it's up to you to decide if you want to share it or not!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI love games, I love making games, and Tiny Barbarian is the sort of game I love to make. With only one person's vision behind it, the biggest risk is that I may have bitten off more than I can chew--I do worry I've promised too much, not just to my backers, but to myself as well. Your dollars are buying my development time, so the question is, have I budgeted enough?\n\nTo convince myself, I have spent the last several month squeezing game development into my free time. (I have a day job, you know!) It hasn't been easy, but the result is a pretty good-looking project with all the groundwork laid out before me. There will be challenges ahead, but between my experience working on other games and having overcome difficult spots in Tiny Barbarian's development already, I know I can overcome them without delay. If I do find myself stumped, I have other experienced people ready to lend a hand. (Daniel already knows I am not shy about asking for help when I need it!)\n\n$12,000, even minus Kickstarter fees, costs for rewards, and taxes (taxes!) is a lot of money. I don't ask for it lightly, and I've taken a lot of time to determine what I need to support Tiny Barbarian's development. With your support, Tiny Barbarian will be finished, it will be finished on time, and--seriously--you're going to love it.
