[{"backer": "Walker Schlundt", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "The 2022 Quest Calendar is a single-player game that takes place on a page-a-day style calendar. Play a couple minutes each day* over the year and get your daily fix of dice-rolling fantasy fun in this role playing game.  The calendar features a story-driven adventure that will be told day by day with plenty of quests, loot items, characters, and combat. As the story unfolds, how will your decisions over the year shape your character? \n* Role play 6 days a week without a GM! Weekends are combined.\nSee the Story, Title, Cover Art, and a Bonus Video in this update.\nGet the 2022 Quest Calendar with fun accessories to make playing every day more fun. We LOVE rpg accessories (maybe a bit obsessed) and want to make some of our favorites available to you at prices you can't get elsewhere.\nProduct designs and color not final and subject to change.\nNote: The mini dice will be blue this time as many backers were hoping for last year. We will have some samples made and let backers vote on the final colors.\nColor and design not final.\nMost RPGs can be difficult to learn for a beginner. The Quest Calendar is very light on rules. Get the current rules used for the 2021 Quest Calendar. If you aren't already playing the 2021 Quest Calendar, try a sample play and buy it here.\nChoose Your Hero\nMeet the heroes of 2022!\nEarly in the Quest Calendar, you will choose 1 character to play for the remainder of your journey during the year. It is a solo adventurer, but many people play together as a family or play with multiple characters in parallel.\nThe game is simple. Follow 3 rules: Read, Roll, and Resolve. \nThe Quest Calendar follows a story. Tear off the previous day to find the next obstacle. It could be combat, a challenge, some treasure, a trap, etc. Read what your hero has encountered and enjoy the art that will sit on your desk for the day.   \nMost days will present you with options to overcome the encounter and dice rolls to see how well your hero prevails. The dice to be rolled will be clearly detailed and instructions may also tell you which of your Hero's abilities will modify the roll. \nOn the back of the previous day you tore off, you will find the outcome of your decision based on the results of your dice rolls.\nYou can't have an adventure without fighting. Combat is similar to other encounters but involves more rolling. It also allows your hero to use their combat-based abilities. Like other days, the dice to be rolled will be listed on the front while the back of the previous day explains how to resolve combat.\nHere is a video that helps describe combat for the 2021 Quest Calendar. Sorry for the poor audio quality. You can also check out some videos below of other adventurers playing the 2021 quest line.\nAs the year goes on, your hero will get better in many ways.  Like other RPGs, you will level up and increase your traits, combat stats, and gain new abilities. You will also be able to buy in-game items with gold you take from your enemies. You may even find powerful magic items.\n\n Note: The mini dice will be blue this time as many backers were hoping for last year. We will have some samples made and let backers vote on the final colors.\nHere is what you get with each Pledge Tier:\nWhat do you need to play? The only thing you need to play The 2022 Quest Calendar is the calendar itself and some dice (or a random number generator). You can get both in the Adventurer Pledge.\nLooking to get two? Want to gift a Hero Set or Champion Set to a friend? Double your pledge now and you can allocate those funds in the Pledge Manager after the campaign ends. Applies to the Early Bird Specials. \ud83d\udc4d\nSpecial Day\nSurprise a loved one with their own holiday in the 2022 Quest Calendar. Have your Anniversary, Birthday, Graduation, or other celebration (within reason) placed in the Quest Calendar on the date of your choosing. With the Deity Pledge, you get all the great items in the Champion Pledge plus you get to pick your own day to claim as a holiday. It will be printed on all calendars for all adventurers to see and celebrate with you!\nSome goodies you can add onto your base pledge.\nSome items are only available in the Champion and Deity tiers or as an Add-On in the Kickstarter Feature . If you want these items, or an extra copy of the Quest Calendar or Hero Book, use the Kickstarter Add-On feature to include them when you make your pledge.\nDon't forget to add on these items when you select your pledge.\n\nWe will open up a Pledge Manager after the Kickstarter. The pledge manager will act as a store and allow you to add on extras of any item. You will be able to use any extra money pledged as a credit in the pledge manager.\nAfter this project gets funded, there are a few things we can do to improve the fun. Stretch goals add complexity that we need to minimize for our tight deadlines so we aren't going too extensive with them. We welcome your ideas for other goals. \nWe did it!\n\n\n\nThis is for those of you that have grown attached to your characters over the year.\n\n\nWe will be USA, CAN, EU, UK, AUS friendly this year!\nIn order to provide you with the best possible value, shipping will be charged through our pledge manager after the campaign ends. The pledge manager will also allow you to confirm your shipping address, add on extras, upgrade your backer reward, and distribute your digital downloads.\nWe have included estimated shipping rates for in the chart below. Shipping will be based on final weight of all included items. Additional add-ons will add to shipping costs.\n Local Pickup\nIf you are local to the Denver, Colorado Springs, or Pueblo area, we will host a local pickup event so you can pick up your copy for free. For those willing to drive to Colorado Springs, we will set up a time and a location at a local game shop so you can come get your Quest Calendar packages, meet the creator, and get your copy signed. You will be able to select this option in the pledge manager after the campaign ends. \nWe had a great time doing a local pick up in November of 2020. Hope to see you again.\nEven the mighty heroes of the realm can not escape the punitive decree of the high king's taxes.\nWith the tax laws around the world changing around to crack down on e-commerce business (such as Kickstarter) we will need to register and pay sales tax to the areas we ship to. In the US, sales tax must be collected in Colorado where we have a presence. VAT in Europe is collected when we import the products. If you live in one of these areas, we will be collecting the VAT and taxes of sales (not shipping) in the pledge manager after the campaign ends.\nColorado : 7%      |      UK : 20%      |      EU: 19%\nSundial Games wants to support online retailers and brick and mortar stores. We have added a retailer pledge. The pledge amount confirms your commitment to order and helps us to to finish the product. The full credit will apply to your final order in the pledge manager.\nGo here for the details on the Retailer packages offered.\nWe are open to adding more items for retailers if there is a desire to do so.\nKickstarter will charge you for your initial pledge amount. Your card won't be charged for your order until August (estimated). Proof of retailer status will be required. Shipments are planned to be sent in late October along with other backers.\nPledge today to help bring this game to life.\nOur funding goal will allow us to pay for the extensive amount of artwork for this calendar as well as get it into production. It requires 300+ full color illustrations. Without your backing, this calendar won't happen.\n 2022 is a new year. With it, we get a new calendar with new features. We are still listening to your feedback and questions. and planning changes for next year. Here are some new features:\nA new story in the fantasy genre (title and plot to be announced later)\n4 New Heroes to choose from (can we unlock more?)\nNew treasure and loot items to buff your hero\n Re-designed Character Sheets \n New Combat Mechanics: Add status effects to your hero. A slight addition to combat that can make some fights harder. Do you get poisoned and lose health? Or stunned and lose an attack altogether? Perhaps you can lose or gain an advantage during combat? New items and abilities can help mitigate these effects.\n New Story Mechanic:  Your decisions to attack or steal items will cause you to lose Virtue points. Your Virtue determines if you are 'Heroic' or 'Corrupt' which may open up or prevent you from choosing certain options to handle situations. Virtue may give certain heroes bonuses or boosts combat abilities.\n More time. With the funding we got for the last Quest Calendar, we were able to start development for 2022 sooner. This helps us deliver it to you sooner, add more interesting encounters, and have more time to edit and proof read. The mistakes in printing and wording are embarrassing for us. We hope to do better this year.\nWhat adventurers are saying about the 2021 Quest Calendar\nAlthough this is a solo adventure, many adventurers are playing in groups and sharing their journey. Since it takes a full year to play all the way through, there are no comprehensive reviews, but here are what some people are saying:\nNewRightNetwork.com (Dr. Christopher W. Smithmyer) rates the game a 37 of 50\nBoard Game Geek has a current rating of 8 out of 10.\n \"Go Big or Go Gnome\" - a side-by-side story re-telling of the daily adventure. \nBoards and Bees Buzzworthy Review\nEverything Board Games Review\nDo you know of another review we should feature here?\n\n\nThe heroic party bringing you this sweet adventure\nIf you are still reading, I want to thank you. This game calendar means a lot to me and my family. We had a great time last year making the 2021 Quest Calendar and I believe the new 2022 Quest Calendar will be a great product that will fill your need for fun every day and I am passionate and dedicated to bringing it to you. \nThe designer and and some key artists that bring the Quest Calendar world to life.\nTo fulfill all the art, we expanded our team of commissioned artists. If you have artistic talent or know someone who does, contact us at artist@sundialgames.com\nTerms and Conditions for backing this project\nBy backing this project, you acknowledge that the final appearance, materials, contents of the rewards are subject to change and may differ from what is presented while the Kickstarter campaign is active.\nYou are responsible for confirming your reward and providing the necessary shipping information (e.g., your contact info, address, phone number) in order to receive your reward in a timely manner. If you do not confirm your pledge within 6 weeks of receiving our notification via email, you agree that Sundial Games has fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received. Sundial Games may, at our discretion, refund or ship your reward after the 6-week window has passed on a case-by-case basis. After two shipping attempts to your confirmed shipping address have failed, you are responsible for any additional postage/shipping costs to re-ship your reward.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe calendar is not in its completed state. While the new mechanics and story are mostly done, there is a substantial number of art assets, writing, and play testing to complete. This is why we are on Kickstarter.\n\nWith Kickstarter, there are always potential for risks in terms of manufacturing delays, unexpected law changes, and logistical complications. \n\nWe launched the 2021 Quest Calendar last year and were able to ship it at the end of November and early December. Problems with USPS and Covid caused delays, but most backers received their orders in time for the holiday gift giving season.\n\nA calendar has a tighter deadline than most other projects. Problems we encountered with the timeline shortened our ability to proofread and edit adequately. There are some mistakes which are embarrassing to us as creators. We are addressing those that impact players through updates to an Errata page on Board Game Geek, answering questions when asked through the many communication channels open to you, and by correcting print and play versions when appropriate. \n\nThis year, we are moving forward with our learnings from last year. We have already begun many phases in our development sooner than we were able to last year. We aim to complete development sooner, reduce mistakes, and begin manufacturing earlier in hopes to ship a month earlier.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "Apprentice", "descp": "A high-quality PDF version for you to print and play.\nINCLUDES:\nAccess to Pledge Manager\nPrint and Play (PDF)\nAll Applicable Unlocked Stretch Goals", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2021"}], "stat": ["550 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "Retailers", "descp": "Get a set of Quest Calendars to sell at your store.\nSee \"Retailers\" section in the Campaign tab for packages and shipping information.\nINCLUDES:\nPrint and Play (PDF)\nAll Applicable Unlocked Stretch Goals\nAccess to Pledge Manager", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["42 backers", "Add-ons"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 22 or more", "title": "Adventurer", "descp": "ONE copy of 2022 Quest Calendar, a set of the Kickstarter exclusive Mini dice, and the PnP PDF.\nShipping will be collected after the campaign ends (see \"shipping\" section for details).\nINCLUDES:\n2022 Quest Calendar\nKS Exclusive Mini Dice\nPrint and Play (PDF)\nAll Applicable Unlocked Stretch Goals\nAccess to Pledge Manager", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["890 backers", "Add-ons"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 34 or more", "title": "Hero", "descp": "ONE copy of 2022 Quest Calendar, mini dice, and a Laminated Hero Book to make tracking your character easier easier and fun.\nShipping will be collected after the campaign ends (see \"shipping\" section for details).\nINCLUDES:\n2022 Quest Calendar\nKS Exclusive Mini Dice\nHero Book\nDry Erase Markers\nPrint and Play (PDF)\nAll Applicable Unlocked Stretch Goals\nAccess to Pledge Manager", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["2,398 backers", "Add-ons"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 100 or more", "title": "Champion", "descp": "Get the 2020 Quest Calendar with all the goodies!\nShipping will be collected after the campaign ends (see \"shipping\" section for details).\nINCLUDES:\n2022 Quest Calendar\nKS Exclusive Mini Dice\nPrint and Play (PDF)\nHero Book\nDry Erase Markers\nDice Tray\nFoldable Dice Tower\nDice Scroll\nMetal Dice\nAll Applicable Unlocked Stretch Goals\nAccess to Pledge Manager", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["232 backers", "Add-ons"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 300 or more", "title": "Deity", "descp": "Get the 2022 Quest Calendar with all the goodies!

It is NOT an option for the '# or more Pins!' tier choices, and is only available as an add-on or by itself.\nHard enamel pins are decorative art pins that can be worn or otherwise displayed. They have raised metal lines forming the 'line art' and the recessed sections between the lines are filled with colorful hard enamel.  Then the whole thing is polished smooth!\nAn example of a pin I previously designed, the Kitty Reaper\nAbove you can see the front, side and back of the Kitty Reaper, a pin I designed and had produced last year!  The back of the pins have pointed posts with rubber clutches to hold the pins in place when worn. \nPins I have designed worn on a jacket, a lanyard and a small backpack\nPeople wear pins on jackets, bags, lanyards and other articles of clothing.  Some people prefer to display their collections in shadow boxes or on cork boards.\nI also like to put them on my dice bags!\nSeries 1\nIn January 2020 after my wife and I had our third child I was taking the night shifts with the new little one so that my wife could try to get some rest.  Most nights I had a sleeping newborn cradled in one arm and a sketchbook within reach of the other. Magic was happening between 2 AM and 5 AM and I ended up designing little black cats dressed as all 13 5e classes, plus a DM. \nI ran a Kickstarter to turn them into hard enamel pins and it grew well beyond my wildest dreams!  Over 1,100 people backed that project.  I ended up with 25 pin designs and nearly 15.000 individual pins produced in total!\nThe Series 1 designs in the green box will be available as add-ons in BackerKit when you are filling out your backer survey after the campaign is finished.\nSeries 2\nThis year I created all new designs for each of the classes and the Game Master!  I also switched the genders from what I did last year, so if a class was male last year, it is female this year. (You can choose to see whatever gender you like in the designs, as cats tend to look like cats regardless, but in my mind the pointy hands and feet are the girls, and the rounded hands and feet are the boys.)\nI may also have a few additional design surprises in store depending on how well this campaign does. \ud83d\ude09\nBut perhaps you had something more specific in mind? \nFor those with more specific taste, at the Custom Kitty reward tier I will work with you to design a Custom Kitty and have it produced as hard enamel pins.  Once they have been produced you will receive twenty-five (25) pins of your choice from this Series 2 campaign.  Get 25 of your Custom Kitty or swap some out for other pins from this project, it is all up to you!\nI, Joshua Pinkas, will retain all rights to the resulting design and will be able to sell and distribute additional pins or any other derivative work in perpetuity.  \nCustom Kitties doesn't have to play by the 'rules'.  While it could be inspired by a DnD player class it doesn't have to be.  Maybe a brightly colored witchdoctor is more up your alley, or perhaps a two headed ogre kitty!  If it generally can fit under the banner of the Fantasy genre it is fair game!\nThe resulting design will be similar in size and style to the other designs in this campaign and will also become selectable as a reward for other backers of this campaign.\nNo nudity, lewdness, gore, or obviously offense concepts will be allowed.  I reserve the right to refund your pledge in full and cease work on the custom kitty if for some reason we are unable to come to an agreement on the final design.\nIf you pledge at this tier and want pins in addition to the 25 described above please add an additional $8 US per pin you would like.\nI designed these awesome pins, but it is expensive to have them all produced as pins. Think of Kickstarter as a place for you to pre-order these pins to help me fund production.  It also helps me understand which designs are more popular than others.\nYou pledge money to this campaign, then when the campaign is over Kickstarter collects the money from you and gives it to me.  I will then send you a survey through a tool called BackerKit to find out which designs you want, and where I should ship them.  I then use the money to pay my production partner to make the pins.  Then when I receive the completed pins form my production partner I inspect them for quality, package them up and ship them out to you!\nIt will take several months for all of that to happen (especially for larger projects like I hope this one will be), but at the end of it we have brought something awesome into the world that didn't exist before, and I cannot do it without your support!\nThank you for helping me in my creative journey!\nBecause of the logistics involved with running a project such as this we have built in what we believe is a reasonable cushion time to handle any unforeseen complications.  If all goes well and we don't need the cushion time we will be shipping the pins out as early as we are able.  Having said that we greatly appreciate your understanding and support as we work to deliver you the highest quality we can.   \n My name is Joshua R. Pinkas and I am the creator and owner of Frost Dragon Designs, LLC. After years of working on projects for others through freelance work and private commissions, I decided to start building something for myself and started Frost Dragon Designs, LLC.\nI am a seasoned pin creator and have designed, had manufactured, and delivered thousands of beautiful enamel pins.  Many of my previous designs are available for sale through my online shop, frostdragondesigns.com.\nAll of my designs are my own original creations. I start my creative process with traditional drawings in sketchbooks. Even the simplest of designs will usually go through a dozen or more revisions before I recreate it digitally and prepare the files to send to my manufacturers.\nI love launching new projects and designs on Kickstarter because this is where I got my start with my company, and because I have found a wonderfully supportive community here who genuinely care about creatives.\nEvery pin you back helps fund the production of new original designs!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI am a designer, not a manufacturer, so I have to trust my manufacturer to execute my designs at a high level and on time.

Also minor changes in the design may occur to prevent manufacturing problems, but these will only be made if it is absolutely necessary and every effort will be made to preserve the original aesthetic.\n\nAdditionally, though shipping logistics could always potentially be a problem, I have reliably shipped thousands of pins via USPS.\n\nIf any issues arise I will be sure to notify backers.\n\nPlease note that everyone's monitors display images a little differently.

These cards provide keywords to spark your imagination and example phrases for their use. Written by novelists and organized by dungeon-masters, the cards are designed for quick on-the-fly use and inherently add randomization. The list of monster parts uniquely depicted include, but are not limited to, the following:\n Horns\n   Teeth\n   Claws\n   Protrusions\n   Bodily Forms (Hides, Ears, Eyes, etc.)\n   Tails\n   Wings\n   Tentacles \nBetween great heroes and great monsters lies the pinnacle of drama \u2014 Combat. The unrelenting tension that comes with knowing blood will be spilled, and life may be lost. Monster Description Cards will guide you while you detail these moments, providing keywords and examples for horns that PIERCE, claws that SLASH, tails that BLUDGEON, and more. Hundreds of new ways to describe monster strikes in these familiar categories: \nSlashing\nPiercing\nBlunt\n\nWhat happens when a monster is cornered, heavily injured, or both? What if the creature is smart enough to be deceitful, spiteful, or vindictive in its last moments? How can you subtly share that your monster is on its last legs, but there is still a worrisome hint of malice in their eyes? These questions are all answered by the LAST STAND section of the cards. Where examples help illustrate the response of creatures facing overwhelming odds and perhaps displaying heroism, sacrifice, or wickedness of their own.\n\n\n \u201cWRITERS OF ALL LEVELS LOVE THE IMPACTFUL NARRATIVE EXPERIENCES DESCRIPTION CARDS ADD TO THEIR WORKS\u201d \nThere are common composition principles that ask writers to \"show and not tell .\" That is, allow the reader to experience the story through actions, words, thoughts, senses, and feelings rather than through the author's summarization and cliches. The Monster Description Cards reinforces this principle by providing keywords to spark the imagination and elegant examples chock-full of distinctive story-building concepts.\n\"Cliche Busting Cards\"\nThere are three cliche busting writer's tools within the Monster Description Cards.\n\n 1. Above all else, the \"core descriptions\" provide brilliant creature concepts. They share unique ways to introduce or explain distinct physical features to an audience. These \"core descriptions\" allow writers to stay far away from monsters, terms, phrases, or even ideas that are now unoriginal and thoroughly overused.\n   2. The second tool in the deck is the Combat Sections. These areas focus on drawing an audience into the sheer violence of monstrous combat, exploring unsettling concepts like great height and length, great strength, even preternatural abilities. They touch on the tension that lingers with the threat of a hero's death. These cards collect these concepts and inherently randomize them for writers to literally draw inspiration.\n   3. The LAST STAND is a fresh and new idea for our card tools. Whether you write horror, sci-fi, or fantasy fiction, your creatures and oddities will need to be compelling and memorable, particularly in their last moments. The LAST STAND helps by offering depictions of your monstrosities on the verge of defeat while adding a bit of doubt in the reader's mind with one last defiant moment.\n  AS A STORYTELLER, HAVING A MEMORABLE ANTAGONIST IS A KEY INGREDIENT TO SUCCESS. SO JOIN US! WE BELIEVE YOU WILL LOVE THESE CARDS.\nFor GameMasters (In-game Play)\nThe cards will melt right into your game, and your players will think you are brilliant. They will provide idea after idea on improving monster encounters. But more importantly, they will also drive you to new, full-blown campaign ideas. The type of campaign that players will reminisce about for years to come. The Monster Description Cards archive these feats by offering up concepts over statistical modeled stat-blocks. The cards narrate one-of-a-kind characteristics that you can easily add to existing monsters, creatures, or oddities. \n\nIntroduce extraordinary creatures to your players, giving them clear signs of why they might be unique, even among their kin. \n\nImprove combat by focusing on the right adjectives associated with the body part landing the blow, such as claws, tails, or fangs. Not only are there specific narrations for specific body parts, but they are also broken down by blunt strikes, slashing strikes, and piercing strikes. With these multiple combinations, you can keep your combat fresh game after game. \n\nLastly, there are always moments in the game where a GM would like to subtly provide hope to their players by indicating the monster is nearing defeat. These epic final moments are depicted in the LAST STAND sections of the Monster Description Cards.\nWriting advice on worldbuilding typically leads towards lists of 'rules' and 'tips' which are either too general to be useful or downright wrong. The Monster Description Cards instead provide concepts and implementations of ideas capable of driving your imagination to discoveries about the world you want to create. Alongside the Magic Description Cards, the Monster Description Cards can immerse you in creative ideas and concepts that are anything but clich\u00e9.\n\nIF YOU'RE A GM, THIS IS AN EASY BUY, BUY, BUY DECISION.\n\nFamiliars and Animal Companions: Your Familiars and Animal Companions are cool as hell. Let me make them sound cool as hell. Select a few cards that match the combat style of your familiar or animal companion and hand them to the Gamemaster to describe their attacks with style. Critical hits made by your Familiars or Animal Companion should be magnificent, and these cards provide that strike description that can be so satisfying. You can even have a LAST STAND card ready for your Familiars or Animal Companion just if things come down to that. Moreover, the cards' descriptions can be the basis of the unique features that make your Familiar or Animal Companion distinctively yours. So let\u2019s build something special with these cards.\n\nShapeshifting: In tabletop RPGs, there are thousands of classes/powers/feats/spells that can shapeshift or grow body parts into lethal weapons. Thousands more transform hands to claws, teeth to fangs, arms to tentacles or growing tails, bony protrusions, even wings. Each of these wonderful transformations can benefit from the Monster Description Cards. The Cards will instantly make these transforms unique and unforgettable with clever depictions, separating your character's ability from the crowd of other characters with similar capabilities or sometimes the exact same class ability, power, feats, or spells.\n\nUsing the cards to depict transform spells: Using the Monster description cards to verbally illustrate the results of magical effects that modify a character's body is more than just a way to be unique; it's how you build a legacy. Stylize your character's abilities with these cards, so they are recognized by others, respected, or even feared.\n\nMonster Journal Entries: Commemorate the monsters you've encountered by inserting Monster Description Cards in your monster journal. Flip through cards of unique descriptions to depict the memorable battles along your character's journey. Each card is your personal trophy, a memento of your battle-scars from the most challenging encounters. You can even use these cards to log essential information about certain monsters in your campaign, making every entry a result of your character's meticulous observations during battle. Sing the song better than any bard could with these encounter-defining descriptions. \nBuild a strong visual library with the entire series of description cards from Conflict Games. The entire Description Cards line can be used as a database for ideas, concepts, events, environments, and fight scenes. Not only do these cards bring new ideas to concept art, but the combat styles and descriptions therein can help portray your creation in a way that works and sells a room on the idea.\n\nDuring the Concept art process, Game Design, and Film writing, an artist and designer often craft creative assets like anomalies, monsters, characters, and fight scenes that heavily influence the final work. Our Descriptions Cards have been used during this process for great success. If the goal is to provide realistically visualize ideas for VFX teams, animators, and modelers, then the Magic, Combat, and now Monster Description Cards can be an innovative way to help and become key part of your process.\nUnlike our previous description cards, these cards are double-sided and chock-full of goodness.\nBackers will receive: \n200+ Descriptions and introductions of various monster components\n  300+ Combat descriptions sorted by monster appendage\n  100+ \u201cLast Stand\u201d descriptions, for portraying monsters that are heavily damaged vengeful, desperate, or relentless\n  Printed on heavy card stock (350 gms)\n  Large Format Card (tarot sized cards)\n \nSize: 2.75'' x 4.75'' (70mm x 120mm)\n  Over 100 total cards, including stretch goals\nEach card is organized under the following general categories:\n Horns & Frills\u2014Horns are hard permanent outgrowths, often curved and pointed and typically found in pairs. Frills are upward-curving bony plates typically extending behind the skull.\n\n Fangs & Maws \u2014The Fangs category is considered the mouths, jaws, teeth, and maws of large, small, or odd creatures.\n   Claws & Pincers\u2014The claws category consists of pincers, paws, talons, and hooks. That is, any style of sharp, usually slender, and curved nail at the end of hands and feet.\n   Protrusions & Osteoderms\u2014This category consists of bony deposits that form knots above scales. Protrusions regularly produce sharp structures that can be used offensively, or widen scales and plates that add to the defenses of a monster.\n Bodily Forms\u2014Creature hides, eyes, noses, ears, or other physical oddities that might distinguish a creature from its nightmarish kin are the focus of this group.\n   Tails\u2014The hindmost part of a monster, such as the flexible extension of the backbone in a vertebrate. Tails can be used to whip, constrict, or trip an opponent.\n   Wings\u2014This category focuses on wings of all shapes and sizes, functional or non-functional: Elliptical wings, high-speed wings, long soaring wings, and more. For the cards combat backside, wings will batter with winds, slice with sharp edges, and stab with spiked ends for a unique description style.\n   Tentacles\u2014The tentacles cards help depict any elongated, boneless, flexible organs, limbs, antenna, or barbels of famed monsters.\nPotentially more to come with stretch goals, so please back and share this project.\n\nOne the backside of the cards are Combat Description for the associating Monster part. The cards are divided into three suits, which correspond to the three common attack types of Blunt, Slashing, and Piercing.\n \n\nWe understand that there are a multitude of genres, points-of-views, worlds, rulesets, and games that writers and tabletop gamers choose. That\u2019s why our writing philosophy dictates the following rules which will ensure our content is system-agnosit, narrative Neutral and friendly to writers at all levels of expertise:\n We don\u2019t describe the person perceiving the monster.\n   We don\u2019t give names to monsters.\n   We don\u2019t mention blood specifically, but generalizations like \u201cfluid\u201d are occasionally used .\n   We don\u2019t describe the surface the monster is on.\n   Nothing cheesy, corny, or racy will be accepted.\n   Both Heroes and Antagonists should be cool, so let\u2019s make them sound cool!\n  System Neutral: The card descriptions are not tied to any tabletop ruleset or Genre, meaning they can be used to describe monsters in any of your favorite tabletop-rpgs. If you run multiple games in multiple systems, these cards are great to use in any and all of your games.\nThe cards will help you answer question like these:\nIn a sea of zombies, what if you need one to stand out?\n  In a world of dragons what makes this dragon different? Special? Memorable?\nAnime is all about unique characters and ability, so why not use the cards to create singularity among a crowded field?\nREWARD SUMMARY\nPLEDGE LEVELS\n\n\n\n\n\nTo add an add-on to your Kickstarter pledge, follow these steps:\n1.

Fortunately, this is our 5th Kickstarter under the Conflict Games LLC brand and we have consulted on over 20 others. The Monster Description Card Deck is a fairly straightforward product. However, the foreseen risks involved include shipping logistics and the unexpected cancellation of contracted artists, writers, editors or product manufacturers. In the case of contract cancellation, the contractor will need to be replaced. Which in turn, could delay the project's completion but shouldn\u2019t prevent its completion. \n\nIn regard to shipping, logistics could become burdensome. We are unable to control the fact that domestic and out-of-the-US shipping costs seem to be spiraling out of control. However with our target funding goal, we don't foresee this preventing the project from succeeding; although, it may impact delivery dates. \n\nThe one guarantee we can make is that we will be transparent with issues and communicate them to our backers as quickly as we can. We strongly believe our target funding goal is sufficient to complete our vision for the product. \n\nIf you're as excited about this card deck as we are, then help us exceed that goal - we have much more we wish to do for this card series. This is just the first step in an exciting journey so please JOIN US!\n\nPlease Note: The final design of the Monster Description Cards deck and stretch goals may vary as many of the graphics above are digitally produced. Examples of this include, rounded card corners vs squared corners and raised lettering vs flat ink on the final packaging.\n\n\nRequired Attribution Text\nThanks to:\nsolid platonic solids by Dank By Design from the Noun Project\nDeath by rayhan maulana rikzan from the Noun Project\nrating by Flatart from the Noun Project\ndigital by Eucalyp from the Noun Project\nstretch by KEN MURRAY from the Noun Project\nShipping by Gregor Cresnar from the Noun Project\nbooks by Yeong Rong Kim from the Noun Project\nD20 by Lonnie Tapscott from the Noun Project\nCards by Henry Ryder from the Noun Project\ntwo by Laura Reeny from the Noun Project\nfall by Rendra Tri Kusuma from the Noun Project\nUnicorn by Lazar Nikolic from the Noun Project\nStory by Lars Meiertoberens from the Noun Project\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Thank you kind Sir or Madam!", "descp": "You will receive project updates & Mark M.

However, some of the best descriptions are longer than others. This may be a problem for physical cards, but not for the digital products. Therefore, we will be doing another round of selection to ensure only the cream of the crop gets printed. At the same time, we did not want to shortchange you guys on the creative efforts because of trivial physical limitations. Therefore, we have also decided that all 880 descriptions will be published on the Digital products (i.e., API, app, and writer's grid). The physical cards are my favorite, but there is an advantage to digital. With the bulk of the writing work completed, we are now moving on to the project's subsequent two phases.

However, I have been extraordinarily particular about the descriptions that make the final cut. In my mind, they must be good \u2014all of them.  For that reason, our writing room has created a ton of descriptions, and to guarantee high-quality creativity, we also have many rejections, edits, and rewrites. Each of these steps has gone slower than I anticipated.  I may add writers to the project, but I believe the best solution to the delay is to simply keep writing.

I'm a designer, calligrapher, and illustrator following my dreams of creating a line of joyous products for my shop. This is not my first enamel pin design but it is my first Kickstarter, and I'm so excited to share these designs with you!\nDon't worry \u2013 you won't be charged for your pledge unless the campaign meets its initial goal! \n\n\u2728 THE DESIGNS \u2728\nVintage postage and brightly colored designs are a couple of my favorite things! After the success of my Anemone Postage Stamp enamel pin, I had an idea to create a series of hard enamel pins that feature the sun and moon, incorporating them into a classic postage stamp design. \nThere are five total pin designs planned in this collection! The initial goal will unlock the first design, and each additional design will be unlocked if stretch goals are achieved. Limited edition and collector prints are available for certain pledge levels.\n\nALL PIN DESIGNS ARE NOW UNLOCKED! \n\n\n\u2728 BONUS GOODIES \u2728\nThree options for bonus goodies are available for this project!\n Limited edition 5\" x 7\" print: a full-color print of the original set of 4 pin designs! Printed digitally printed on acid-free, archival paper with an eggshell textured finish.\n Signed + Numbered Foil Prints: choose from a collector's edition 5\" x 7\" print of the original set of 4 pin designs in full color with gold foil accents, or gold foil on acid-free black paper. See below for a photo of these gorgeous prints!\nThese are available at certain pledge levels or as add-ons!\nLeft: Full color print with gold foil accents. Right: Gold foil print on black paper.\n\n\u2728 ADD-ONS \u2728\nAdd-ons are now available for the campaign! Now you can add extra pins to your pledge without changing your pledge amount (or losing your early bird status)!\n\nANEMONE POSTAGE STAMP PINS\nI'm also offering my Anemone Postage Stamps (photo below) as an add-on for those who are interested! These will be offered at the $10 campaign price, which is $1 off my Etsy shop listing. Woohoo, discounts!\nThis pin is my original postage stamp design (the one that started it all) and will match the other pins in size and shape. It's a great way to round off the collection, especially if you're pledging for all 5 pins!\nPOSTAGE STAMP STICKERS\nNow that all stretch goals have been unlocked, STICKERS to coordinate with the pin designs are available as an add-on (photo below)! These will be offered at a discounted price before they're listed in my Etsy shop at their regular price. Designs are already being produced and I'll have them in-hand at the beginning of December!\n\n\u2728 TIMELINE \u2728\nNovember 1st-December 1st: Kickstarter is live and pledging is open! Once the Kickstarter ends, a survey will go out to ask which pin designs you'd like as rewards.\nDecember-January: Pin production begins! Average production time is between 30-45 days, but depends on the final quantity.\nFebruary: Rewards will be shipped! All packages will be shipped via USPS First Class or Priority Mail, which include tracking information.\nNOTE: These dates are estimates and may change, but I'll keep backers updated if any delays occur!\n\n\u2728 SHIPPING \u2728\nDomestic (US) backers: All packages will be shipped via USPS First Class or Priority Mail, which include tracking information.\nInternational backers: Good news, international shipping is now open! \nPackages will be shipped via USPS with tracking.\nYou are responsible for paying customs fees, import taxes, service fees, and any duties that your country charges.\nTracking may not update once the package leaves the US, but don't panic! Tracking should update when the package arrives in your country.\nDue to COVID-19, shipping delays may occur. If your country is not accepting mail from the US during this time, please pledge responsibly \u2013 I can't be held liable for any delays in rewards due to international shipping, customs, etc.\n\n\u2728 OTHER DETAILS \u2728\nWant to follow me? You can find me on Instagram, Facebook, Pinterest \u2013 though I'm definitely most active on Instagram! \nPins will be made in North America with all other packaging/shipping materials proudly supporting small businesses in the USA.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nEnamel pins are created in a factory and are made by hand, so there is always a possibility that large orders can be delayed, some colors may look different, and errors may occur. Current and final colors may look different in person than they do on your screen due to screen/monitor calibrations. Some details may be altered during the design process as well \u2013 that's to ensure we get the best enamel fill possible!\n\nOnly collector-quality pins will be shipped as rewards. Any seconds/B-grade/C-grade pins will be available for sale in my Etsy shop.\n\nShipping via USPS is the most affordable option for shipping pins but has its limitations, including delays, failure to scan the package at each post office destination, and other delays due to COVID-19. Patience is key! :)\n\nAnd of course, if there are any delays at all during production/manufacturing, backers will be updated!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "1 Pin", "descp": "Choose one (1) pin from the unlocked pin designs!

It's now the time to see what lies hidden and reveal the ship's final days.\"\n The basic idea behind Trip 1907 (second edition), is to provide an enhanced game play by limiting the webpage usage, and focus on the hardcopy. In this version the webpage is only for submitting the chapters answers and receiving puzzle hints.\nThe main differences between Trip 1907 Interactive Escape the Book Game and Trip 1907 (2nd Edition): Dark Sails are on the game experience. The new version does not need logging into the website. The passcodes are there to save your progress as well as the sanity system is now embedded inside the book. The passcodes are transformed into game clues and 5 riddles have also been replaced with new ones, along with two Easter Eggs. In this version the book's story will be in the hard copy.\nIn this version of Trip 1907 (2nd Edition): Dark Sails you will find:\nA new, faster, website has been added with no registration required.\nThe \"sanity\" token hint exchange system is now on the hard copy. It is up to the players to keep track of their sanity tokens spent, leaving more space to continue the book even if all sanity points are spent.\n Pass codes have been added in order to save the game progress and give a linearity on the game puzzles.\nThe game story will be on the hard copy instead of the website.\n 5 riddles have been replaced with two easter eggs on the hard copy.  \nIn order to play Trip 1907 (2nd Edition):Dark Sails you will need:\nA copy of Trip 1907 (2nd Edition): Dark Sails.\nA pencil.\nAn internet connected device.\nA pair of scissors.\nIn this version you will need to go through 45 chapters of the book, solve the puzzles, submit your answers online and get the passcodes of each chapter.\nTrip 1907 (2nd Edition): Dark Sails  is finished. Given previous experience on Kickstarter the game is finished as well as the play-test getting an excellent response from our game testers.  In this way delivery is a primary issue to us and will be done through Amazon & KDP separately for every backer of this project. Main goal is to complete all the shipping process by the first days of January. \nEU countries together with USA and Canada have at the moment an estimation time for dispatching of 5-7 days.\nIs Trip 1907 (2nd Edition): Dark Sails an eBook?\nNope, Trip 1907 is  a hard copy book.\n\nDo I need an app to play it?\nNope, all you need is the copy of the book a pen and an internet connection.\n\nIs there a hint system for the riddles?\nA hint system is provided on trip1907.com, where players can exchange their sanity tokens for hints.\n\nAre there any additional charges for playing the book?\nNope, once you have purchased your copy there are no additional perks to buy.\n\nWhat is the language of the game?\nEnglish.\n\nIs there a forum to keep up with the riddles?\nA forum will be provided for players exchanging ideas over the riddles.\n\nI have the original copy of Trip 1907 Interactive Escape the Book Game, should I back this one?\nThere are changes in 5 [puzzles and gameplay. So if you have played the first version you will only find 5 different riddles. The story and the rest of the riddles remain the same.\n\nWhen this version will come out so I can buy it?\nThis version will be launched on February 2021.\nBook Game specs:\n                 Dimensions: 13.97 x 21.59 cm (5.5\" x 8.5\" Inches)\n                 Pages: 170+\n                 Puzzles: 45+\n                 Artwork pages: 20+ ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOnce this is a second version of an already successful book game, the risks are limited on the delivery.

We can even order a special pizza just for them if they don't like pepperoni.\nAt the Special Guest reward tier I will work with you to create a Pizza Party design and have it produced as hard enamel pins.  Once they have been produced you will receive ten (10) pins of your choice from this campaign. Get 10 of your Special Guest or swap some out for other pins from this project, it is all up to you!\nI, Joshua Pinkas, will retain all rights to the resulting design and will be able to sell and distribute additional pins or any other derivative work in perpetuity.\nThe resulting design will be similar in size and style to the other designs in this campaign and it will be added to the list of pins that others can pledge for in this campaign!\nNo lewd or obviously offense concepts will be allowed.  This is intended to be an original design of a creature, animal or other.  Designs based off of known pop culture characters such as Mario or Sailor Moon will not be permitted.  I reserve the right to refund your pledge in full and cease work on the Special Guest if for some reason we are unable to come to an agreement on the final design.\nIf you pledge at this tier and want pins in addition to the 10 described above please add an additional $9 US  per pin you would like.\nMy name is Joshua R. Pinkas and I am the creator and owner of Frost Dragon Designs, LLC.\nI am a seasoned pin creator and have designed, had manufactured, and delivered thousands of beautiful enamel pins.\nAll of my designs are my own original creations. I start my creative process with traditional drawings in sketchbooks. Even the simplest of designs will usually go through a dozen or more revisions before I recreate it digitally and prepare the files to send to my manufacturers.\nI love launching new projects and designs on Kickstarter because this is where I got my start with my company, and because I have found a wonderfully supportive community here who genuinely care about creatives.\nEvery pin you back helps fund the production of new original designs!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI am a designer, not a manufacturer, so I have to trust my manufacturer to execute my designs at a high level and on time.

Each theme will consist of 15 bases ideal for fantasy miniatures and printed at home on your own 3d printer.\nMy name is Casper and I am the designer behind BasicAid. I am a wargamer and miniature hobbyist through 25 years. For many years basing was the thing I liked the least about the hobby. The miniature was done, why would I bother with something extra like the base? Fast forward several years, and I have learned how important a great base is for a great miniature. The base really sets the scene and mood for the mini you used countless hours on.\nWell, why not have great bases in no time? That was my thought, and that is why I have chosen to release the bases I have designed. These bases are designed to be easy to print, and easy to place miniatures on while still being as epic and detailed as possible to really set the mood for your miniature. \nSo, let\u2019s dive into the themes and see what it's all about!\nI play Malifaux a lot, and I play Ressurectionists among other factions, so a Victorian graveyard was on the plate. There is ofcourse loads of tombstones, but also vines, roots and roses are growing all over the place, as I wanted it with a feeling of neglect. The place is holding the dead, and therefore shouldn\u2019t look too new. You will also find such things as a shallow grave being covered with dirt, Victorian lampposts and crucifixes. If I could add a low hanging mist to these bases I would, but that\u2019s the image I have in my mind, with the light from the lampposts seeping through and shadows moving just out of sight.\n5 examples from the Graveyard. Click the image for more renders\nA mosaic for every base, an image that I find well suited for all those awesome factions inspired by the far east out there. Whether you play as Yakuza, Ten Thunders, New Tokyo or some other far east inspired faction these will add so much atmosphere to your setting. This set, as the only one, is without further assets, but are solely focused on the mosaics. This is intentional and to avoid cluttering the base, as the base should set the stage and support the miniature, and with mosaics on all of them, I think a good balance was struck. \n5 examples from the Asian Temple. Click the image for more renders\nIn my mind I imagined some dusty, cluttered laboratory or floor in a wizards tower. Books, scrolls and runes should be all over the place. Reading spaces, experimental vials, potions and flask are of course also a big part of the scenery. I love the thought of elementals, summoned demons as well as wizards, sorcerors, conjurers and every other school of magic could reside on these bases. Good times in the raids of World of Warcraft in Kharazhan was just behind my eyes, while designing these spaces. Explore the cover of the different books, and you might be inspired to what magic user or bound creature should fit that particular base.\n5 examples from the Wizard Lab theme. Click the images for more.\nI really like the story behind this set. A major human settlement has fallen, are you placing the villain or the hero on the base? Do you choose a kobold, a skaven or an orc on top of the debris crying out their victory at the end of the sack? Or will it be the knight, the paladin, the adventurer exploring the ruins, retaking the settlement from evil? You will find leftovers in the ruins, and I hope it will inspire you to new adventures.\n5 examples from the Ruins theme. Click the image for more renders\nAmong one of my favourite races in RPGs and Warhammer when I was introduced to fantasy books and games at the age of ten, this race needed some awesome custom bases. As both Druuchi and Drow alike are very slave centric cultures, I chose to center the feel around chains, manacles and other uncomfortable stuff to lock up all the nice people that they raid. Runes for dark elves are pointy in my mind, like so many other\u2019s, and the floors are plenty decorated to give just that feel.\n5 examples from the Dark Elf theme in 30, 40 and 50 mm sizes\nIt could be Arakoa, Gryphkin, harpies, phoenixes or some other fantasy race or model with an avian feel you place here. In my mind, these are intelligent beings set in a civilized environment with pavements, art, statues and mosaics. I have tried to bring forward a sense of pride in their heritage or a cultural feel, where their own civilization is at the center. Feathers are abound, along with symbols of wings, birds, nests and eggs in different sizes and statues revering the avian forms. I hope you get the same feel.\n5 examples from the Skyhall theme in 30, 40 and 50 mm sizes\nThe Norse theme is as a dane close to my heart, so real runes and and runestones with a twist of fantasy has been my main inspiration for these bases. As most fantasy Dwarf lore is based on a lot of Viking art as well, the bases will also fit dwarves and even Space wolves for Warhammer 40k perfectly and so will any other miniatures in a cold setting.\n5 examples from the Norse theme. Click the picture for more.\nThat's the previews of the 7 themes. During the campaign, you will see spotlights on each theme, and there you can read more of the background behind the design, as well as see renders of every single base in that theme. \n\nAs a backer of lots of other campaigns, I love stretchgoals and how I keep checking on where we're at during a campaign, so I planned alot of very cool stuff for you guys! Here you can see into the future as we hopefully make this Kickstarter as full of content as possible!\nAll above are unlocked!\nAll the above are unlocked!\nFree Halloween gift for all backers!\nA special Halloween gift from BasicAid to all of you :) click the image for more info\n\nFREE GIFTS FROM THE 3DPRINTINGPRO!\nAs I have mentioned, I have collaborated with Greg Kourakos aka 3Dprintingpro on his Kickstarter:  Pit Fighter, Blood on the Sands and there are 4 scenic bases there made by me as a gift for backers, if you haven't already seen them. Now Greg has been so kind as to give all backers here, one of his fighters to you guys, whether you back his campaign or not! So as a free gift to all backers of my campaign, you get the Barbarian Queen!\nHere she is painted by the master of the cartoon style: Epic Duck Studios\nA wonderfull sculpt by RN Estudio who is among some of the best out there\nActually it was her who inspired me to my Gates of Valhalla base, and because of that, she will be bundled with the scenic base I made for her, so not only will all backers get this awesome sculpt thanks to the charity of Greg, you will also get this:\nOk I know that technically the gates of Valhalla should accomodate several hundreds of warriors marching abreast, but it's a sidegate, ok... :P\nHere they are together just like the base was made for her ;) (it's bluetack under her feet, not a fail)\nPrinted on Phrozen Sonic Mini, Elegoo ABS-like grey.\nMERCHANTS: the Barbarian Queen and Gates of Valhalla are both off limits, and NOT a part of the license, unless you are a merchant of both this Campaign and Pit Fighter: Blood in the Sands.\n\nFree gift from Mythic Miniatures!\nAs another gift I got a fine terrain set from Mythic Miniatures for you. These guys focus on modular terrain and really take it to a new level. See here how you can use these parts one by one or all together :D\nThey are live with their own campaign right now. Give it a look :)\nAs a gift these are EXCLUDED from merchant license and provided for all backers of \"all about the base\" and upwards (ie. not for solo theme backers).\n\n\nCollector pledge:\nOn top of the \"It's all about the base\", you will also get a pack of assets for you to change up your bases. The pack is from the start full of more than 30  different assets that fit one or more of the themes from this kickstarter. This pack will be increased as part of this campaign as we break through the stretchgoals! (50+ assets now due to stretchgoals)\nIt's more than fifty assets now thanks to the stretchgoals unlocked by the supporters, click the image to read more about added assets\n\n\nMerchant pledge:\nIf you want to sell physical prints of the files you will need a merchant license \u2013 see the Merchant pledge level. The license runs for just over a year from the 1st of December 2020 until the 31st of December 2021. You can print and sell as many copies as you like in that period, but you have no further rights to the digital files, which may not be sold, shared, loaned or in any other way made available for anyone else than you. After the period expires, you are welcome to contact me regarding an individual extension.\nBe aware the license is for 3D printing. Casting, making molds of and any other manufacturing proces other than 3D printing the files is not a part of the merchant license.\n\nDesigner pledge:\nWe will be part of the design proces together for a whole new set! You will inspire and set the overall tone for a set of bases I will make. You get to be part of the design of 3-5 bases depending on their size. You get to decide whether it's circle, square, oval or even hexagonal bases, if that's what you like. You will be the first to receive the bases you're part of, and when the rest of the set of at least 10 bases, are ready for release, you will also get that. You will also be mentioned as co-designer on the set.\nWill you ask for? sci-fi? Jungle? Egyptian? Something I haven't imagined yet? I look forward to the inspiration and ideas you bring.\n\nConcept:\nBasicAid delivers STL. files for bases. This means that after the kickstarter have ended, you will receive the files for which you have pledged and will be ready to print straight away without supports in most cases, see the print guide for more information. The pledges will be fullfilled via MiniHoarder.com who will ensure reliable and safe transfers of your files. \nEach set consists of seven 30 mm bases, five 40 mm bases and three 50 mm bases. If you need some other size, the bases can be rescaled in your go-to slicer before you print, though you should take one of the bases closest in size to the size you are rescaling to. Be aware that some details are so fine, that scaling down might tamper with the level of detail. The bases are designed with 28-32 mm scale miniatures in mind.\nDuring the campaign I will add a spotlight for every theme, so you can see closeups of the different bases for each theme along with more painted examples. Watch the update section.\n\nPrint guide:\nI testprint each and every base in this kickstarter before you get them. I printed them all on a Phrozen sonic mini and below you will find my settings in the screenshot, be aware that every printer is different, and that these are just my setting. I printed in Elegoo ABS like grey resin.\nMy Chitubox settings\nAs a hobbyist myself I know the value of getting pressupported items for your printer, and I have designed most of the bases in a way, that you can print them perfectly, directly on the plate. I did not want my ideas constrained by only making things to print supportless, so if the design needed it to be right, I did what I think looks the best. So some of the bases need support, and those supports are already included. So you don\u2019t need to do anything but add the files to your slicer and go print.\nNOTE, the supported versions are chitubox files.\nHere is a great guide from 3Dprintingpro to printing bases perfectly and easily on the plate. \nGreg from 3Dprintingpro is a friend and we have collaborated on his kickstarter: Pit Fighter: Blood on the sands, where I have made 4 custom, scenic bases for the backers there.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe themes presented here are 90 % done.

Stretchgoals will be ready as soon as possible, but I don\u2019t want to risk lower quality for speed.

We set out to make a perfect, pocket, edition of the classic game. Aside from size, card and component quality is in line with the original game.\n\n\n\nPFG worked with various partners to find a cost effective way to ship a single copy of Herbaceous: Pocket Edition internationally. Unfortunately, in a padded envelope, it is just a smidge too thick for international letter shipping. Therefore it is basically the same cost of shipping a small game (and there are a lot of additional shipping fees these days). \nHowever, since it is so small / light, it doesn't cost more to ship 2 or 3 copies in the same box. If you are outside of the US, I highly recommend buying the double or triple pack to split with a friend or give it as a gift. It is an easy, gateway game for almost anyone.\n> Herbaceous Pocket will be EU Friendly,UK Friendly, CA Friendly\nKeep up on Herbaceous\n                            - Follow Herbaceous on Facebook\nKeep up on Us\n                            - Pencil First Games, Follow Ed on Twitter\n                            - Dr. Finn's Games, Follow Steve on Twitter\n                            - BethSobel.com, Follow Beth on Twitter\n                            - Thunderworks Games, Follow Keith on Twitter\nBoard Game Aggregators\n                            - Herbaceous on BoardGameGeek.com\n                            - Herbaceous on BoardGaming.com  \nIntro Video, Header & Lifestyle Photos: More Games Please, Follow Ross on Twitter ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\n\"Herbaceous: Pocket Edition\" is Pencil First Games' fourteenth Kickstarter. \"Lift Off!

Box and instructions are near final and we have been working closely with our printer. Limited amounts of work will remain based on how the KS unfolds.\n\nThere are inherent risks whenever undertaking a project as complex and large as producing and distributing a board game, but we have over 6 years of experience dealing with these. We've gone out of our way to surround ourselves with experienced board game developers, distributors, and people who have run and launched successful Kickstarters. This team of friends has been exceedingly supportive and we're sure will help as we hit any upcoming bumps in the road. And there are bumps. Strikes, shortages, shipping delays, and pandemics are all hard to predict.\n\nMost importantly, if something does go wrong, we will keep everyone in the loop as the project moves forward and comes to market.

Think of it like an escape room you can do at home! In this game you're searching for hidden clues and puzzles in beautifully created notes from an alchemists' apprentice. \nMysteries of Alchemy : Collector's Edition\nThe notes are sent to you by James, the butler of late Bram van Amstel, one of the first professional treasure hunters from the previous century. Try to unravel the puzzles and clues to find the treasure! You can play alone or with friends. You might be really surprised when you finally find the treasure and see what it is.\n\nWHAT'S INSIDE\nMysteries of Alchemy exists on a number of papers (a4 size) containing the notes from an alchemists' apprentice. In the picture below you see an overview of some of the papers. Extra papers will be in the game but we are keeping them a surprise for now. \nOverview of some of the papers\nOne of the puzzles called Tabula\nOne of the puzzles called Distillation (SPOILER FREE IMAGE)\n\nHOW TO PLAY\nPlay solo or work together as a group. Each separate puzzle takes approximately 15 minutes or up depending on the previous experience of the player. \nAge 14+\n1 to 4 treasure hunters\n Appr. 90 to 120+ minutes \n\nThe puzzles are a variety of different kind of puzzles and no outside knowledge is needed to solve the puzzles.\nStep 1: Transform the room into one that is an alchemy lab from ancient times (optional)\nStep 2: Make sure you have some snacks and drinks\nStep 3: Open the envelope\nStep 4: Study Little John's notes and try to find and solve all puzzles\nStep 5: Check the separate solutions on the game's website\nStep 6: Celebrate your successful treasure hunt\n\nBACKGROUND INFORMATION\nFor those who already played and found The VOC Treasure, the name Bram van Amstel should ring a bell. For those who don't know Bram van Amstel, he was a very successful treasure hunter in the 20th century. A few years ago he passed away as an old man. In his last years he continued his treasure hunts from his home by doing lots of research in books, documents and online. He was an old man and traveling was impossible but he kept on researching and gathered lots of information about treasures yet to be found. \nIn his will he stated that all heirs would not receive any money from his inheritance. Instead Bram's butler James is going to send you unsolved treasure hunts. James started shipping The VOC Treasure last year and very soon he will send you the Mysteries of Alchemy.\n\nMaking Of\nTop: Aging papers with tea and coffee - Middle: Printed on hand pressed paper - Bottom: Drying aged papers\nThe last treasure hunt called The VOC Treasure had some unique items like a wooden box, a glass wine bottle and a fabric sea map and more. To match the same level, Mysteries of Alchemy is also made from quality materials and the production process is a mix from old and new techniques. \n\nThese are the steps for creating this game:\nstep 1: Research in archives looking for inspiration\nstep 2: Choose the books and pages which can be used for puzzles\nstep 3: Create the puzzles\nstep 4: Draw the pages by hand on normal A4 paper\nstep 5: Scan the pages and adjust them with Photoshop\nstep 6: Print the pages on hand pressed paper\nstep 7: Manually age the hand pressed papers\nStep 8: Drying the manually aged papers\nstep 9: Scan the manually aged hand pressed papers\nstep 10: Send the scans for beta testing\nstep 11: Adjust puzzles and redo step 4 to step 10\nMysteries of Alchemy : Collector's Edition will be printed on hand pressed paper and all pages from each Collector's Edition will be aged manually.\nPicture taken in a Dutch city tower called Sassenpoort\nFor those who love the looks of the game but can't or don't want to pay the price for the Collector's Edition there are two other options:\n Option 1: A digital game existing of scanned pages from the Collector's Edition in .pdf format. To make home printing easier (and cheaper) I'll include a .pdf version of the game on a white background as well.\n Option 2: Mystery of Alchemy existing of scanned pages from the Collector's Edition, printed on 200-250 grams uncoated paper\nMysteries of Alchemy - (option 1, the Standard Edition)\n\nSTORY\nThis is a story of a teenage boy named John Kleyne or as his fellow alchemy students would call him Little John. \nAs alchemists' apprentices one of the many things they were trying to discover was chrysopoeia, the art of turning base metals into nobel metals like gold. This process symbolically indicates the creation of the philosophers' stone.\nOne by one the students had interesting discoveries. But once a student told the alchemist about his discovery this student would disappear. At first it didn't seem alarming to the other the students but in the following months, other students would just simply vanish in thin air, after they made a discovery.\nWeeks went by before another student made a great discovery and he shared it immediately with the alchemist. It was a joyful moment in the middle of a wet and rainy week. Later that night, John had to clean some things and walked around the shed which the apprentices used for sleeping. It was still pouring rain when he heard some cracking sound coming from the woods. Over a couple of months the neighbourhood had some problems with wolves, so John hid himself behind a pile of chopped wood. He peeked through a hole between some larger logs and he was surprised to see the alchemist sneaking out of the woods holding a shovel. John thought to himself how strange it was and started thinking about the missing students from earlier that year. His curiosity took over and he waited five minutes after the alchemist entered his house before John cautiously followed the trail of wet and muddy footsteps into the wood. John had always been afraid of this dark and mysterious place but some strange force from within kept him going. Totally wet, he suddenly arrived at a open circle in the wood. Stones were placed in a circle and in the middle of the circle he found something that looked like a freshly dug grave....\n\nTreasure - John knew immediately that he wouldn't be safe if he shared his discovery with the alchemist. Earlier that week he was getting more and more close to creating something really valuable. It was only a matter of days before John would discovered the complete and correct process of (***** spoiler alert).\nAbraham, his best friend among the students always told him stories about treasures maps with clues, puzzles and immense hidden treasures. What if hid his discovery in his notes like some kind of a treasure map and never tell the alchemist...?\nHe reached over to get the last book. It was just out of his reach so he leaned over a bit more. The ladder made some strange and dangerous noises when he almost lost his balance. His index finger hooked behind the top of the book when he slipped. The book fell down and with an acrobatic move Bram prevented himself from falling. Hanging onto the ladder he saw some old looking papers dropping out of the book on the ground. \"Really, are those the papers I was looking for....?\"\n\nBeta Test and Review\nSome of the leading people in the At Home Mystery industry helped to create this game by beta testing the puzzles. Due to the Corona Pandemic Zoom and Skype are used for long distance contact. For beta testing zoom and Skype were really handy. I got to experience people playing the game and hear them thinking out loud when trying to solve the puzzles. This process helpt me with fine tuning the game.\nBETA TESTERS\n Rita Orlov - PostCurious (The Tale Of Ord & The Emerald Flame)\n Errol Elumir -  Invers Genius (Podcast Room Escape Divas & Cryptex Hunt\n Michelle Rundbaken - Society of Curiosities (Mysterious Map Heist & Mystery Subscription Box)\n Yacine Merzouk - Society of Curiosities (Mysterious Map Heist & Mystery Subscription Box)\n Chris Waters - Constructed Adventures (Numerous Tailored Treasure Hunts & Constructed Adventures Youtube Channel)\n Stephen Lockyer - Escapage (Flatpak, Arrival, Escape The Compound, Vica Versa, Miracle '47 and Prisoner 7)\nJillian Raymond\nTop Left: Chris Waters from Constructed Adventures - Top Right: Michelle Rundbaken and Yacine Merzouk from Society Of Curiosities - Bottom Left: Jachin Letwory the creator from Mysteries of Alchemy - Bottom Right: Errol Elumir from Room Escape Divas and Inverse Genius. *note, the beta testers had individual with Jachin\nREVIEWS\nMichelle Rundbaken - Society of Curiosities \n\"The papers look so authentic and we loved that the puzzles were firmly rooted in alchemy manuscripts. If we didn\u2019t know better, we\u2019d think that we were looking at genuine alchemy recipes! I felt like I learned more about alchemy by playing \u2013 and there were some really neat elements and stories that actually were real.\" [read the whole review]\n\nErrol Elumir -  Invers Genius\n\"I enjoyed the puzzles I was able to beta test and it seems like a good choice for those starting to get into take-home puzzle experiences\"\n\nStephen Lockyer - Escapage\n\"(Jachin's) puzzles are beautifully designed and completely immersive. Using thoughtful and clever mechanics, the puzzles match the theme perfectly, and are ones you will return to again and again.

It has become something of a tradition!  \nFor 2019 I designed a group of mischievous kittens that had been adopted by a witch.  This year I wanted to extend that idea a bit by imagining that three of those kittens had taken a special interest in magic and had become apprentices!  The colors of the hats and cloaks is also a bit of a head nod to my original Witch Cat pin campaign from 2017.  \nAbout Frost Dragon Designs, LLC\nMy name is Joshua R. Pinkas and I am the creator and owner of Frost Dragon Designs, LLC.\nI am a seasoned pin creator and have designed, had manufactured, and delivered thousands of beautiful enamel pins.  \nAll of my designs are my own original creations. I start my creative process with traditional drawings in sketchbooks. Even the simplest of designs will usually go through a dozen or more revisions before I recreate it digitally and prepare the files to send to my manufacturers.\nI love launching new projects and designs on Kickstarter because this is where I got my start with my company, and because I have found a wonderfully supportive community here who genuinely care about creatives.\nEvery pin you back helps fund the production of new original designs!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI am a designer, not a manufacturer, so I have to trust my manufacturer to execute my designs at a high level and on time. There could be production issues that are beyond my control that could impact the delivery date. Also minor changes in the design may occur to prevent manufacturing problems, but these will only be made if it is absolutely necessary and every effort will be made to preserve the original aesthetic.\n\nAdditionally, though shipping logistics could always potentially be a problem, I have reliably shipped thousands of pins via USPS.\n\nIf any issues arise I will be sure to notify backers.\n\nPlease note that everyone's monitors display images a little differently.

A hearty set of 10 vibrant and fun hard enamel pins expressing every board game addict's most commonly used sayings and little inside jokes!\nI'm Michelle, I am a designer who married a board gamer, and this pin set is the result. \nIf you missed part one, scroll down to the bottom to see pictures from the previous mega set of board gamer pins. If you're a previous backer, welcome back! To thank you all for your patience, I am just going to come out and give all returning backers 1 free pin! Check the FAQ for more info and thanks for coming back!\nThank you for backing this campaign!\nBy backing this campaign, you get:\nTo be FIRST to get your hands on these pins, before they're available for sale to anyone else\nAccess to these major bundle discounts (including a free pin for returning backers) that won't be matched after the campaign\nFree stickers included with your rewards!\n Free Bonus stretch goals! (scroll down for more info) \nPins that aren't funded during this campaign won't exist later, so thank you for giving these pins a chance!\n(Give this gif a minute to load for maximum shininess!)\nThe Pins:\nThe main funding goal of $400 covers this first tier \"All These Board Games\" pin AND Sticker Sheet. Each additional $400 raised after that funds and unlocks another pin that you will be able to pick as a reward!\n\n\nEach of these pins will be made with :\n Black Nickel metal plating\n 2 pinbacks with clear rubber clutches to eliminate spinning and keep your pin secure\nWhite, grays, and a color pop of these playful, bright colors (except for the first pin, which gets ALL the colors!) These were designed with pantone colors to ensure accuracy in manufacturing, but please note that all screens display colors a little differently. (If you bought the first set, the colors will match, plus two new colors added for this set)\nHard Enamel\nIf you're familiar with the last set of pins, these pins are all the same size as the \"board gamer\" pin, except \"All these board games\", which is a little big taller.\nThe preview images you see on this page are mockup renderings! While the real pins will be shiny and pretty, of course nothing in real life can be as perfectly flat and glossy as a digital rendering (nor can they stand up magically on their own). For a realistic idea of how the final pins will look, please see some actual photographs of the first kickstarter set at the bottom of this page.\nFREEBIE Game-Weight Stickers:\n5 stickers will be unlocked alongside the pins in the campaign and included for FREE according to your reward level! They will be sturdy, glossy stickers, 2.5 in. tall, on heavy duty vinyl. \n\nSticker Sheet:\nThis 5x7 inch sticker sheet is unlocked from the get-go and includes sticker versions of all of the 10 pin designs. These individual stickers are ~1.5 in. tall, the same size as their pin brethren. (You'll also be able to add these to your reward later in the survey if you want.)\nEdit: I realize I left out the sticker sheet as a listed item in the top tier $85 10 pin reward slot but listed it in the description. I cannot edit the reward now that the campaign is running, but just to be clear, backers of this 10-pin reward tier WILL get the sticker sheet AND all 5 game weight stickers!\n\nBonus Stretch Goal Freebies!\nYou have all gone above and beyond what I expected for this kickstarter, so here\u2019s more FREE STUFF!! Magnets are free to ALL pin backers (everyone who has backed for at least 1 pin reward) and will automatically be added to your reward. Keychains are free and automatically added to all backers of AT LEAST 6 pins. If we get all the way to $9000, everyone who has backed at least 1 pin will get a free embroidered patch! These are cumulative, so if we make it to $9000 you\u2019ll get all of these extra stretch goal items for which you are eligible!\nAll of these extra stretch goals that we unlock will be available as ADD-ONS in the backerkit survey, so even if you backed for the sticker-only rewards and aren\u2019t eligible to get a keychain for free, you can still get one for $10 USD plus shipping (or a patch or magnet for $5 USD) and shipped with your other rewards.\nA flexible magnet perfect for your refrigerator or other magnetic surface! \n\nSlightly smaller than the pins themselves (so it won\u2019t be too clunky if it\u2019s on your keys).\nSame width as the \u201call these board games\u201d magnet.\n\nI do not have a realistic looking preview of how this patch will look when embroidered with thread, so you\u2019ll have to use your imagination. It may look slightly different than this mock up, as the edges will be sewn, but I\u2019m confident it\u2019s going to end up looking hella cool. It will include 11 colors of thread and I\u2019m very excited to see it!\nAdd-Ons\nI get lots of questions about add-ons (which you can also read about in the FAQ) but here's some basic info to help familiarize you with what you can do to get more stuff in addition to your pledged campaign reward, that'll be shipped at the same time as your pledge reward.\nYou can either wait for the backerkit survey after the campaign to purchase these items, or you may want to add the extra amount to your pledge NOW in your campaign pledge manager. That way you'll get charged the extra amount at the same time as you are charged for your main kickstarter pledge and the credit will be waiting for you so you can select extra pins and stickers in the backerkit survey and not be charged a second time. This will also avoid any extra transaction fees from a second transaction.\nCool, so some of the things you'll be able to add-on:\nThe previous campaign's 15 pin set \"Board Game Genres\" will all be available to purchase for $11 USD per pin\nThe previous campaign's 2.5 in. stickers (ask me about my kallax, first player, rules lawyer, less AP more VP) will be available for $3 USD per sticker\nThe previous campaign's sticker sheet of 15 game genre stickers will be available for $5 USD per sheet\nTHIS CAMPAIGN's freebie game weight stickers will be available for $3 USD per sticker\nTHIS CAMPAIGN's sticker sheet will be available for $5 USD per sheet\nMy \"Dragon's D20\" enamel pin (view on my site if you're curious!)\nAll additional unlocked Stretch Goal items from this campaign (keychains for $10 USD, magnets for $5 USD, and patch for $5 USD)\n\nTimeline\nAll of the design files have been finalized and approved and quoted by my manufacturing partner, who brought the last gorgeous set to life. Here's how I expect the next few months to go, barring any additional craziness in the world:\nOctober: This campaign will be live\nNovember: Surveys sent out\nMid-November: Funds received, pins and stickers begin manufacturing\nJanuary: Completed pins and stickers shipped to me and I begin checking them for quality and packaging them up for you\nLate January-February: Rewards sent out!\n(A note on international shipping: I am planning to use USPS First Class International Package service to save you all some cash, but it may take the pins weeks longer to reach you. During the last campaign, some people had significant postal system and customs delays. So, while you should expect between 7-21 days, there may be delays beyond this time frame. If you are an international backer and would like faster shipping, you can ADD $12 USD to your pledge, and I will ship your package USPS Priority, which should arrive in about a week. This option will also be available in the backerkit.)\nFunding Breakdown\nOf the initial $400 funding goal - covering the \"All These Board Games\" pin and sticker sheet - the budget breaks down as follows:\n70% Manufacturing costs for pins and stickers\n20% Shipping costs\n5-10% Kickstarter Fees\nThe FINAL first set of board gamer pins from the first kickstarter\nThe FINAL first set of board gamer pins and stickers from the first kickstarter\nThe best way to be sure that your favorite pin gets unlocked is to share this campaign with all of your board game night regulars!

Because of this, we want to put all our energy into achieving the mass production of the game in the most simple and efficient way. That being said, we would rather not add any more goals to this project, besides, we are more than satisfied with Flora as it is right now!\nTo answer this, we need to explain first why we need funds. As you may now have figured out, this project is a dream for us, and as so we were willing to invest all we could to make it a reality. We invested not only two years of meetings and testing time, but also funds in the design, illustrations, video, sampling, and campaign. But the biggest roadblock we had was when we found out we needed $25000 to pay the manufacturers, print, and ship our game so it arrives on your shelf. If we reach our goal, we will be able to pay for the manufacturing and shipping of the first edition of Flora. As you can see from our campaign, samples of the game have already been produced and designs are complete. Apart from design improvements in some game components, we have our manufacturers lined up and ready to go.\nWe fell in love with the Kickstarter Boardgame community when we as individuals started backing projects and saw how we quickly became more than backers, we became a part of the project. We're proud to reward our Kickstarter backers with discounts on the game, first-in-line knowledge, insight into the project, and a direct line of communication to us as the creators. We consider each Kickstarter backer to be an essential part in our present and future game making venture.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are some uncertainties in terms of timing when it comes to anything produced internationally, such as:\n\n\u25cf Production delays \n\u25cf Shipping delays \n\u25cf Customs delays\n\nThe estimated delivery date is March 2021, but keep in mind this is only an estimate. Also, due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others.\nWe've done our best to minimize this as much as possible, and we are always happy to refund pledges if for some totally unforeseen reason the game can't be delivered at all. Since the game is 95% complete, we don't believe this is the least bit likely, and you can rest assured that we have been working for more than six months to keep this from happening.\nWe commit to communicate every step and update accordingly and have open communications to answer any questions or doubts about timing.\n\nRefund policy\n\nWe can make a refund within 60 days of the campaign\u2019s end, Kickstarter and payment processing fees included. After that, we still have a \u201cno questions asked\u201d refund policy, though that\u2019s minus Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we can\u2019t get back from them after 60 days). However, if we\u2019ve begun packaging your pledge for shipment (usually 4 to 6 weeks before the actual shipping date), no refunds are possible. If a component cannot be delivered AT ALL, we refund that completely, including fees.\n\nAll refunds after the 60 days of the campaign\u2019s end are processed via Paypal only.

In summary, game-play for Flourish is as follows: each turn, you will begin with 6 cards in your hand. Choose 1 card to play into your own garden and 2 cards to pass over the walls of your garden to your neighbors, who simultaneously play their own cards into their gardens. Once all players have played and passed, all players reveal their played card, add the passed cards from their neighbors to their hands, and draw a new card from the deck. Players will place twelve cards total in their garden, scoring its beauty both by the points on their own cards and their neighbors! Clever passing of cards and shrewd placement each season will ensure your garden is the most beautiful in the realm.\nRules May Change for Final Copy\nRules May Change for Final Copy\nClick here for the full GameTyrant Review of Flourish!\nCheck Out The 360\u00ba View of Flourish Here!\nShipping, Customs, and Brokerage Fees\nShipping and taxes will be charged in our pledge manager after the campaign.\nWe try to use local shipping facilities where possible to keep shipping costs reasonable.

The cards are literally the worst quality of all the games in my hundred+ collection! And they\u2019re linen finished of all things which perplexes me. I love linen finish but these card are so week. I stored them just like the illustration and when I went to take them back out the last card on the bottom kept going under the dividers. I tried to gently pick it up and the edge of the card completely separated in two at the edge. The whole game revolves around the cards so that\u2019s where most of the lavish production should\u2019ve went to is a quality card stock. I\u2019m going to be forced to sleeve these and I do not like sleeving cards but these will be trashed if I don\u2019t. If you don\u2019t believe me just go ahead and test them. Just barely take your nail to the edges of them and they start falling apart. Imagine repetitious play and shuffling. Run your nail very lightly across the face and it leaves a long indention with almost no pressure.

In the first volume, you find a message from Mary:\nBeneath Mary\u2019s letter you\u2019ll discover a treasure trove of gorgeous hand-written documents, 2D and 3D jigsaw puzzles, mysterious objects and artifacts, and devious challenges. Prove your worth by studying the documents, constructing the jigsaws, and solving the puzzles... and you\u2019ll be treated to a heartbreaking story that culminates in a shocking reimagining of the truth behind Mary Shelley\u2019s famous novel.\nCombining the best of escape rooms, board games, and immersive theater, Mother of Frankenstein is a 10-15 hour cooperative gaming experience for between 1 and 6 players, ages 13 and up. Mother of Frankenstein was designed to be as welcoming and fun for newbies as it is rewarding for experts, combining the narrative complexity of a good novel with the physicality and challenge of a puzzle-filled escape room. Throw in a couple of clue-strewn jigsaw puzzles, and our game truly has something for everyone!\nOur final stretch(es)!\nStretchy!\nMother of Frankenstein is divided into three volumes. Volume 1 concerns Mary\u2019s teenage years and her education by her iconoclastic father. Players must complete three assignments\u2014poetry, music, and astronomy\u2014each of which is presented in the form of a puzzle. Simultaneously, Mary embarks on a love affair with the dashing (but married) poet Percy Shelley. The course of their courtship is laid out over 15 love letters, though players must read closely to determine the order of events!\nIn Volume 2, the venue changes to Germany, and Castle Frankenstein, where a fancy ball is being thrown on a balmy night in 1814. Players begin by constructing a 300-piece jigsaw puzzle of the castle\u2019s floorplan, then use it\u2014along with gossip rags, billiard hall schedules, and original drawings by comic book artist Liana Kangas\u2014to track the events of the evening.\nFinally, in Volume 3, you\u2019ll construct an epic 3D puzzle of Castle Frankenstein and descend into the secret laboratory hidden therein, where you\u2019ll discover what Mary learned under the tutelage of the famous alchemist who called the place home, and how it inspired her to write what many call the first science fiction novel, Frankenstein. \nWhen our heroes tweet, we screencap.\nThe Standard Edition of Mother of Frankenstein contains the following: \n The Ultimate Edition adds our special printing of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, featuring original art by comic book artist Liana Kangas (which has its own reward tier, if you just feel like a re-read!), as well as a ton of other fancy stuff.

Feel free to pop back to read it now, but the tl;dr of it all is: We're delayed. Game's coming October, or November at the worst. We're working with a super experienced games publisher, so our adjusted timeline is now much firmer, like a Tempurpedic mattress, or the rebuke of an elder.\nSo, given that there isn't any news on that front, we figured we'd share a bunch of new artwork. Terry has been working 60-hour weeks finalizing the insanely complex imagery that goes into the 3D puzzle. Basically, Frankenstein's castle and its environs have been fully modelled in 3D. Then, through Terry magic, 2D textures are constructed to best simulate what it would \"feel\" like to be looking at this 3D castle from various angles, which are then applied to the facades. It sounds complicated, and is much more complicated than it sounds. (DO NOT get Terry started on \"bleed\".

Very much like an Escape Room in a handy format! The solution to each and every puzzle is based not on randomness, but only on logical decisions.\nThe Cluebox is an intriguing challenge. It's difficult to solve, satisfying to hold, and beautiful to display.\nThe facts about the game:\nSpecial edition in multi-color available only for Kickstarter campaign\nSize: 11*11*12 cm\nAge: 14+\nPlayers: 1-2\nPlay time: 60-90 minutes\nCan be reset and solved again by other players\nCan also be used as a sophisticated gift wrap (size of the gift space is 45mm*60mm*10mm)\nLanguage independent\nTHE STORY\nDavy Jones' Locker.\nLondon, 1720. Ian Kensington, captain of the British Engineering Forces, is responsible for the first successful recovery of a sunken ship. In the report to His Majesty King George I of England, Kensington mentions Davy Jones' locker for the first time.\nDespite it being a real artifact, he describes the locker in the context of a legend about the sea devil Davy Jones, who supposedly locks away the wandering souls of all sailors who lose their lives at the sea. It is told that on each sunken ship, he hides a replicate of the locker, promising to release all souls if someone manages to open the box.\n Since the first find, similar lockers were found in shipwrecks scattered around the world. Some of them are still kept in private collections, others in museums. However, nobody has been able to reveal their secret so far.\nWe are sure that you are the one, who will finally be able to open the locker and force Davy Jones to admit his defeat.\nTHE DESIGN AND PRODUCTION\nAccording to Davy Jones he decided to create a special version of the box and release it to the community of Kickstarter. His crafty and intrepid team of developers has spent the last eight months designing and testing this special version of the locker. The team explored a wide variety of interlocks and functionalities, and ultimately settled on a final version which was confirmed by Davy Jones as the most sophisticated version of his locker. \nWe will not hide that our team participated in the creation of the box, but even we don't have the details how to open it as the final mechanisms were personally crafted by the Sea Devil. In any case the Cluebox \u201eDavy Jones Locker\u201c is our most complex project to date\u2014 both from a design and manufacturing perspective. The puzzle is made with loving care out of birch wood and wood oil, consists of 72 individual parts assembled with care by hand.\nTEAM\nOur international team of game and puzzle enthusiasts, mainly based in Germany, established in 2015 company  and developed several innovative board game and puzzles focusing in escape games niche. Today we're very excited to present our first Kickstarter and will appreciate your support to bring our product to life. \nPirate music theme credit to Ross Bugden\nPackage design Federico Meloni/Chris Lattner\nMeet our team member locked in Davy Jones' cabinet and requested to announce start of the campaign.\nMEGABOX (Kickstarter special)\nFor Kickstarter we will produce a special edition of Megabox in multi-color.  Box size is 21,5*21,5*22,5cm. This box is ideal for escape rooms and events with larger amount of people. \nIn your pledge for Megabox 2 boxes are included: 1x Megabox + 1x Standards size\n Complimentary artifact - Davy Jones' Sundial\nDear friends of Cluebox,\nwe have important news to share with you. We're really excited with number of people who decided to support us and we made a serious effort to match the level of expectations and get more mysterious artifacts from hands of Davy Jones.\nAnd today we succeed!  We achieved to get plans of his sundial, which is an important element in the process of solving Davy Jones' Locker: when solving the Locker, keep an eye on the time shown on the clock and don't ever cross the number 12. Otherwise the Locker will turn into ... actually you better don't know what is it, just trust us ;)\nEach one of our bekers will receive a wooden kit of sundial as a big thanks for your support.\nThe size of sundial is 6x6 cm.\n\nOther iDventure Puzzles\n Cluebox - Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s cat \nSchr\u00f6dinger\u2019s cat is a thought experiment by the Austrian physicist Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger that illustrates the problem of quantum mechanics in every day objects. In this experiment, a cat and some poison are locked in a closed box.\nAccording to Quantum Mechanics after a while the cat will be both dead and alive. Only by looking at the object, in this case the cat, the status will be determined. \nUnfortunately, Schr\u00f6dinger completely forgot the cat because of his busy daily routine.\nWe are sure that the cat is still alive, and you must save it!\nBox size: \nSecret space size: 1,5*4,5*8cm\nPlay time: 45-60 min\n Cluebox - Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s cat - MEGABOX \nFor Kickstarter we will produce a special edition of Megabox.

The reality is that shipping and sales taxes are expensive. To offset this we worked with our shipping partners to get the best conditions for our bakers on Kickstarter.  \nFor the EU, UK, US and Canada, your rewards will be sent duty-free from within your region - there will be no additional customs charge. We cannot guarantee customs-friendly shipping in areas outside of the US, Canada, UK and EU. There maybe additional duties and/or fees charged by your country\u2019s governmental agencies and/or shipping partners. Those fees are solely your responsibility, and we can neither cancel a shipped pledge, nor will we pay those fees. In the event that a package is returned or destroyed due to the non-payment of such fees, your pledge will be considered fulfilled.\nShipping charges will be added after the Kickstarter ends - every backer will be responsible for paying these in the pledge manager after the campaign ends.\nApproximate shipping prices listed in the table below, but subject to change based on the pledge size.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAt iDventure, we have a lot of experience fulfilling large orders on strict timelines.

We want to make accessories for modern, aesthetically conscious players.\nWe've kept our backing levels short and sweet just like our first campaign. You can back for either one or two sets of our beautiful dice drop earrings. If you can't decide which finish you like best why not get both? \nEach dice drop earring set comes in either Steel or Rose Gold. As you can see in the below image you'll get yours in a durable pull-out box with the Witch Hunt emblem so it is perfect as a gift for a certain special someone. \n (We know this box doesn't quite fit the earrings comfortably - a manufacturer for new boxes specifically for the dice drop earrings is already lined up!)\nUpdate: Dice Drop Necklace and Bracelet\nDue to the great success of the campaign so far and the interest of our backers we've been working with our manufacturer to design a matching necklace and bracelet to the dice drop earring design. See below mockup of the final pieces. We're SO happy how these have turned out so far!\nUpdate: We've added all of our previous jewelry collections!\nJust add the value of the jewelry pieces you would like and up your pledge to that amount! We'll be using Backerkit to finalize survey responses and you will have an opportunity to add additional pieces after the campaign ends if you choose. \n\nWhat material(s) are the earrings made from?\nThe main material is surgical grade(8% nickel content) stainless steel, and the rose gold versions have been flash plated with 18k rose gold. \nWhat length are the earrings?\n75mm\nWhy stainless steel?\nStainless steel by far outperforms gold or silver in terms of durability. We wanted to bring you jewelry that is not only easy to look after and low cost, but that will also last you for many nights of dice rolling.\nCan I get more than one?\nCertainly! Just multiply your pledge amount by however many more necklaces you want. We'll send out a survey to find out which finish you want after the campaign has completed. \nWitch Hunt HQ is based in the United Kingdom.

Want a unique pin for when conventions return?  Are you just a collector of dope accessories? If so, see what it's all about down below!\nHere's how this page is organised:\n Designs - see all the cool pins we've designed!\n Quality - learn about how we're making the pins\n Not Just a Pin - check out some in-game mechanics the pins come with\n Pricing - see the price structure, and shipping time & cost estimations\n Stretch Goals - self explanatory!\n Communication - includes a link to our discord server.\n\n\nWe've made a design for every core dungeons and dragons 5e class, from Artificer to Wizard, including an extra for your favourite DM. We've even been noodling around with some other fan-favorites, but more on that later. Check out these designs! \n\n\nThis was unlocked when we hit $6000 - on day 1!\nThis was unlocked when we hit $6000 - on day 1!\nUnlocked at $8000 - on day 4!\nUnlocked at $8000 - on day 4!\nWe want to make the best pins we can, and we think we're there. We don't use this word lightly, but these pins are premium.  We've swapped soft enamel for the much more durable and cleaning-looking hard enamel. This has allowed us to add silk-screen printing to the manufacturing process so that we can get those shading effects. \n\nEach pin is around 1 1/4\" or  32 mm wide and is double posted (two mounts) so it doesn't skew when you wear it. The metal is dark gray nickel with rubber backers.\n\nAt Loot Tavern, we make item cards. Each pin you get will come mounted on one of those cards. These have original, playtested, 5th-edition item mechanics that you can also give to your players in-game. Talk about breaking the 4th wall!\nEach pin gives a minor, class-specific boon bringing a small 'quality of life' improvement to the player's experience. These boons are effective at any level and are flavored to help create cool role-playing moments in your adventures. Check a sample of the cards and the mechanics below!\n\n\n\nWe're keeping this simple. The more pins you buy, the cheaper they are. Pins cost:\n $9 each if you buy 1-4,\n $8 each if you buy 5-13, \n $7 each if you buy 14 or more. \nRetailers contact us directly for more info at humperdinkswares@gmail.com.\nCheck out the table below to get an idea of the total price, as well as which tier you should select.\nAdditional pins $9 each\nAdditional pins $8 each\nAdditional pins $7 each\nTotal price for pin orders. NB: It's cheaper to get 14 than 13!\nOne-of-a-Kind Pieces. For anyone who wants their own, bespoke design, we have a tier just for you.  We'll work with you to create your design and mechanical effects. This tier includes the 14 base pins, plus any we unlock through stretch goals, and up to 10 copies of your bespoke pin. Additional copies can be made upon request.\nDue to the time constraints, we can only take a limited number of these orders. We'll be closing the tier 1 week before the Kickstarter finishes, to make sure we can get the design ratified by the manufacturer ASAP.\n\nShipping. We're doing everything possible to get these pins out before Christmas. If we experience no hiccups, we have an estimated arrival date of December 8th, which would allow us to ship the orders that same week. However, in the current crazy climate, the best we can guarantee is a January delivery. Whatever the case, we'll be in touch with you every step of the way.\nPrices do not include shipping. For US domestic, we estimate between $6 for a single pin to $10 for a full batch of 14 and should take 3-5 days.\nFor the rest of the world, we'll be using USPS's First-Class Package International Service. This can take anywhere from 2-8 weeks to arrive, depending on destination. Here are the postage estimates:\n Australia: $19\n Europe: $16\n Japan: $19\n Russia $19\n United Kingdom $16\nPlease be aware that International backers are responsible for any customs fees their country may ask for, so plan accordingly!\n\n\nWe'll release four more designs when we hit each of $6k and $8k so the full 14 are available as soon as possible. If we hit $10k, we'll upgrade to thicker card stock with a linen finish.\nBeyond that, we'll do a new, fan-chosen design at each of the following milestones: $15k, $20k, and $25k. Leave a comment here on the kickstarter with your suggestions for the stretch goal pin designs, and keep an eye on your inbox for when we vote on them! Current suggestions in the mix are bloodhunter, gunslinger, pugilist, and psionic.\n  $6k on day 1 and $8k on day 4!

Due to the number of designs, we have quite a high goal to accommodate the minimum order size for each pin. If we hit the goal, we're good to go.\n\nManufacture - All the factories we queried had great track records and were recommended to us by other pin designers. The one we chose was one of the more communicative as well as being capable of a high quality finish. Final colours might be slightly different to what you see on the screen, due to the enamel technology!\n\nShipping - We expect some bumps, and that's why we're not promising delivery by Christmas. However, if the manufacturer gets everything shipped on time, and it doesn't get lost at sea or held up in customs, we should be able to get it in the post on December the 8th.

Each character has their own unique backstory.\n\nThe story behind this project\n Merchant : This merchant offers a broad range of wares, from llama spit to dragon scales! Find what you need, as long as you have the money!\n\n Merchant`s wife : selling medicinal herbs and spices. If something ails you she might be able to sooth your pain!\n\n Fortune teller : A woman with a good heart and the founder of the caravan, this fortune teller can reveal what lies ahead of time. She possesses magical abilities, among which is transforming herself into a younger and more seductive self! Who knows, it might come in handy one day! If you enter her tent please do not touch anything! Especially not the chest! Everyone has their secrets, right?\n\n Sisters of the war pact : Every camp needs guards, and these three sisters are it for our caravan! They have a strong bond with the caravan's founder, our fortune teller, who brought these orphaned girls up as her own daughters. With the proper fee, they'll happily join you in your adventures!\n\n Torn face : Fighting a ferocious monster with sharp claws left his face torn and disfigured! Lacking the proper expertise, the fortune teller resorted to just stitching the two sides of his face together. Blindness has sharpened one of the remaining senses, the sense of hearing, into an almost superhuman ability! His physical strength remains! No one can survive under his iron fists! \n\n Hunter : A sharp shooter with high visual acuity! No hunt is undergone without securing a bounty, bringing game and valuable live specimens back for trading.\n\n Dishonored knight : Only a true warrior knows the depths of shame after a defeat in combat. Being overwhelmed by his loss in combat, he wanted to take his own life, but some events, and the arrival of the caravan, prevented this outcome. He lost one of his arms, which made room for a curious innovation!\n\n Troupe group : Sit a while and listen! You will find entertainment for hours while you repose after a long day's journey.\n\n Servant girl : She was found unconscious, with the recent events being a blank. The only thing she can recollect is a dragon... yes, there was a dragon somewhere! (Stay tuned for future project!)\n\n Hunter - zombie version : Damn, that crate definitely had a \"do not touch\" sign on it! Our brave and curious hunter dared to get near a zombie that he found in the jungle, where it was dormant. The creature quickly sensed his presence and fiercely attacked him, succeeding in infecting him with a bite. He got bit but eventually managed to put the creature back in his crate! Our hunter has a secret now, that will end up transforming him! (Stay tuned for future project!)\n\n Dwarf : Who ever heard of a dwarf that doesn't like his liquor!? This renowned merchant sells the best wines around, sometimes rarities found in deep and forgotten cellars! \n\n Merchant`s daughter : Are you looking for fresh wild berries, fruits and vegetables? This is the place to look! This young merchant has a vibrant connection to nature and is easily able to source food!\n\nThe scale\nAll miniatures and props are scaled at 32 mm. All miniatures come in two version: with one inch round base and without a base.

Unravel the dark secrets the island holds as you venture deeper into the caves in search of mystery and treasure.  Len's Island is a blend of peaceful building, farming and crafting, mixed with intense combat, dungeon battles and deep questing and exploration.\nReaching our funding goal will mean we will be able to create Len's Island to the level we are happy with releasing. If we reach further funding milestones, we will be able to use this money to add many additional features, continue expanding the game post-release and overall make the game better and more polished.\nStarting as a solo weekend project just under three years ago, Julian Ball / Flow Graphics created Len's Island as a way to make his own vision for the perfect game come to life. Now developed by a small indie team, development has progressed over the years to form a beautiful, immersive, captivating and meaningful experience which we call Len's Island.\nLen's Island brings excitement and progression for many playstyles, all within a vibrant and engaging world. Catering to the hardcore dungeon-crawler fans, home-builders and decorators, explorers and completionists, farming fanatics, collectable hoarders, and people who just want to live the simple life chopping trees as the sun goes down.\nLen's Island is planned to release late March 2021, on Steam for PC and Mac. With potential plans for other platforms, but you'll just have to wait and see...\nWhy are we on Kickstarter? The short answer is, making games is expensive!! We have been working tirelessly to make this game a reality, some of us for years, some months, all without pay, just with a passion for making a great game. But.. we need some funds to finish this project and let it become the amazing experience we wish it to be.\nLen's Island has been in development for just under three years. The first year was Julian, working alone to get the game into a prototype state and see how it played. Making the prototype was a quest to find a perfect blend of creative building, intense dungeon-crawler action, and calming exploration, all inside of a lush and vibrant world that makes you feel right at home. Now with a small team, we have rewritten the original code and rebuilt the game from the ground up.\nAt this stage of development, we have the core systems built, the starting levels and core design almost finished along with a small library of content. We are in the middle of production, starting the alpha-testing phase and iterating on the content we have so far. The next stage of development is polishing the systems we have in place, filling the game with more content like quests, items, more dungeons, and just generally more fun stuff to explore and do.\nThis is a sneak peek for one of the background tracks. Give it a play, read through the Kickstarter page and imagine you're exploring your own island.\nBuild the home of your dreams. Build wherever you want, make it as big as you want, paint the walls, add some decorations, make it your own.\nWe have developed a building system that functions using an easy drag-n-drop interface, with deep customization and limitless creative freedom to build. Start with the structure using the ever-growing library of building pieces. Then choose what style you want to build in, whether it's basic wooden beams, cobblestone, ornate brickwork or a blend of them all. You can paint and customize styles so you can make it truly YOUR home. Want blue walls, white window-frames and a red door? DONE. Then for the finishing touches. Add some decorations, place your bed, build a wardrobe, a weapon rack, a tool chest, and much much more.\nAfter a treacherous journey into the dungeons or a long day completing a quest, you need a haven to come back to that makes you feel right at home. Our goal for the building in Len's Island was to create a system that allows you to create a home that you can truly be proud of.\nLen's Island is also a fast-paced, skill-driven dungeon crawler with a strong focus on engaging a wide range of combat types and loadout combinations. There are many ways to progress in Len's Island.  If you're getting bored of building your home, tending to your crops and meeting the local townsfolk, there are deep, dark caves below the Island with plenty to explore.\nAs you clear the dungeons you will defeat dark creatures, unlock mysteries, complete challenging puzzles, and better your skills in combat. There's also lots of rare ores to mine, hidden areas to find and broken paths to repair. When you travel deeper into the caves you will start to unravel the mystery of what makes the Island so unique.\nCombat is agile and skill-based with a high skill-ceiling for experienced players wishing for a more nuanced experience. Customize your loadout with over a dozen weapon classes and a wide selection of niche weapons. From wielding magical staffs and iron daggers to fiery war axes and rapid-fire bows. Take your own journey through Len's Island and fight the way you want to fight.\nThese are all work in progress animations and attacks. Player animations and more weapon variants are a couple of the key areas that benefit greatly from Kickstarter. We're not animators so we're doing our best with what we have so far.\nThere's more than one way to make some coin in Len's Island. You can loot the dungeons, complete quests, or gather resources and sell produce grown from your farms. Discover rare fruits, attract new wildlife to your home, make your crops look beautiful and make some good money while doing it. \nUse farms to grow the food which fuels your ventures into the dungeons and long days exploring the Islands; as well as grow exotic plants and flowers to sell back to the villagers for gold.\nGrow large-scale farms throughout the forest, or care for small garden beds on your balcony. Or if you're not the green-thumb type, place some pot plants and call it a day. \nWe will have a lot more farming features to show further as we progress deeper into development. Farming is essential if you want to keep your health topped up and your belly happy. You can also use farming as a great way to earn gold to craft better weapons, upgrade your backpack and buy exotic items.\nQuesting plays an important role within Len's island. Help villagers with simple tasks like gathering some wood for Martinel or take on more dangerous ventures like finding lost loved ones trapped in the dungeons. You can make a big impact within the town and make some nice coin while doing it!\nYou're not the only person who's called this Island home. Rescue villagers, fix up the run-down cabins on the island and help them get back on their feet.\nYou can repair and upgrade more than just your own home. Fix broken bridges leading to hidden treasures, upgrade parts of the local town, and uncover secret areas.\nWhen backing Len's Island you will receive a small demo a few weeks after the successful completion of the Kickstarter. Demo copies will be sent on the 24th of September. This demo will be a little mini-Island that we've created. A place where you can build a house and get a feel for the game. \nWe may look like all fun and games, pun intended, though we have been working tirelessly for years to make this project happen. We all share a common passion, and that is to create games and experiences we care about and are truly proud of.\nOur collective professional background and complementary skills are what makes us a great team. Julian's experience ranges from freelance graphic design and game art, to working within large companies as a marketing director and chief operations officer.  Lars has worked as a professional music composer, sound designer and graphic designer for many years, releasing various self-titled tracks and composing for games such as Team Fortress 2. Martin has lectured in game design and game programming, as well as worked on various indie-game titles over the years.\nKickstarter will help immensely with filling the game with more great content, paying expensive bills that any start-up indie studio has to pay, along with expanding upon our current scope. We can hire an artist to make more weapons, character animations and a variety of visual assets. As well as paying our music composer and SFX designer Lars to continue to create beautiful tracks and much needed audio effects for the game. The vast majority of the money raised will simply go directly back into the game itself to make it that much better, adding more content and a higher level of polish. We will need some of the cash to pay business costs, things like accounting, trademarks, set up fees, software licensing, legal fees, etc. Then if there's any money left over, we can use it for marketing and help pay the bills to make sure none of us ends up homeless while working on Len's Island.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nCreating any game has its risks. We try to mitigate and minimize any risks as much as possible with careful planning, project management and always leaving room for contingency. Len's Island is completely self-funded, with Kickstarter being the only external source of income. We chose to fund the game through Kickstarter in order to further minimise risk and ultimately make a better game. Having to keep big publishers happy, or even being forced to change key elements of the game is super risky in our minds. We just want to make the game that we know is great, into a completed and polished title ready for launch.\n\nAll of the funds from Kickstarter have 1 key goal in mind, to make Len's Island the best it can possibly be.

Take charge and direct the immune response in this inner quest: Become the hero you need!\"  \nCup of Hygeia (Goddess of health)\n I am a biologist and I have worked on viral evolution for more than 15 years. Around 2010, I started pondering the idea of a cooperative game where you fight a viral infection. At first, I simply wanted to share with people the immense awe I feel when I learn about the beautiful, constant struggle of the immune system. However, several events resolved me to finish it and to strive to give it a wide exposure.    \nMagnification level 1: Human body\nFirst, a beloved friend died of AIDS, when he was only 33 years old. His death was a heartrending blow for me and our tight-knit group of friends, especially because nowadays infection with the Human Immunodeficiency Virus can be treated so easily. He loved board games and I promised myself to finish the game one day and dedicate it to his memory.       \nMagnification level 2: Heart cross section\nSecond, I grew increasingly worried by the rise of misinformation regarding the boon for humanity that vaccination has been. These feelings gave way to a conviction: that a way to inoculate the minds of people against this pernicious idea is to provide an accessible experience that would teach them the basic workings of the immune system.          \nMagnification level 3: Heart tissue\nMost people live their lives unaware of the epic fight between life and death that takes place inside the complex microcosm of their bodies every day. However, I didn't want a dry simulation or lifeless educational tool: I play board games every week and I wanted to create an easy to learn, dynamic and fun experience.       \nMagnification level 4: B-cell, the hero with a thousand trillion faces\nThird, the COVID-19 pandemic brought a sense of urgency to this endeavor. I recoiled at the myriad of misconceptions and I think it is this lack of knowledge that brings panic into many hearts. I know that a board game sounds banal in these trying times, but  the huge awareness caused by the disease has generated unparalleled interest in learning about how the immune system fights a virus.       \nMagnification level 5: Virus\nFinally, I really wish you enjoy playing this game. It would make me very happy to know that at least one person will become a scientist because of this gaming experience: we need more scientists in the world. Along the same lines, for every 20 copies rewarded during this campaign, we will donate 1 copy to a public school or library. I sincerely hope you support us!     \n You can now take \"immune\" for a spin yourself! \nTabletopia link\nGame rules: For a detailed description, please see the game rules, which come in both English and Spanish versions. For more information, resources and discussions, please see our BoardGameGeek page. \nBrief overview:\nComponents and first turn:\nDetailed description of gameplay:\nTurn description: Briefly, each player\u2019s turn consists of three steps: viral replication, energy allocation and immune actions.\nViral replication: The player takes 2 viral tokens from the infection bag and places them on the corresponding organ of the same color. When both tokens go to the same organ, a debilitating disease symptom occurs. \nEnergy allocation: The player can move one energy token to an adjacent action tile: The more energy tokens, the stronger the action is.\nImmune actions: The player can perform two immune actions, out of the 9 available ones. The immune actions allow players to collect necessary resources, maturate their skills and attack the virus on each organ.   \nImmune actions\nEnd of the game: The game continues until either the virus conquers the human body or the immune system learns to recognize the viral strain: the body is now immune.   \nMagnification level 6: An example of some of the amino acids needed to learn to recognize the virus\n\n I hoped to create a game that:\n Was easy to explain. Although I wanted the game to be faithful to the science behind the immune system and thus encourage the player's curiosity, I primarily  wanted a fun and accessible experience. Most of the time we prefer playing games with streamlined rules that are easy to pick up but still provide a meaningful challenge. However, if you wish to play with people without any experience on strategic boardgames, please follow the simplified variant included in the rulebook.\n Was replayable. I like cooperative games because they play differently depending on the group of people. Besides that social aspect, each \"Immune\" session is different with three difficulty levels and a combination of 1 out 16 viral threats (each with its own stats), a subset of the disease symptoms that can come during game play and a random spatial array of the immune actions. \n Was mostly language independent. All action tiles and many cards have iconography to show what they do. Although several cards are written in English, each card's description can be found in the rulebook (which contains both English and Spanish versions). I hope to translate the cards to more languages with the help of the board gaming community. However, if you wish to play a completely language-independent game please follow the simplified variant included in the rulebook.\n Could be played solo. In case of victory, the game provides a score to measure and encourage the player's improvement over time. When you have defeated the highest difficulty, you can increase the viral defense value, which will result in even higher scores.\n Didn't have prescribed roles. Roles are interesting in some cooperative games, but I often find them restrictive: there is a single thing you must do, because it is the best thing you can do. Although each player has a once-per game special ability, there are no different roles in \u201cImmune\u201d: each player in this game specializes as the game progresses. \n Worked at all difficulty levels. After play testing enough the core engine of the game, I searched for the best parameter combos (for example how many disease cards, resource values, etc). Thus, I created a python program (MARVIN) that played the game randomly until victory or defeat. Then the combo's fitness was calculated as how far the average winning rate was from a desired target on each difficulty level. I searched exhaustively over all parameter combos and those that made it into the game were the fittest ones.    \nPlease see the interview below, where these and other topics are discussed: \nThe game will be delivered only to USA, Mexico, Canada, countries in the European union, UK and Australia. The game will be shipped from within the country or region, thus avoiding import fees and taxes. The shipping cost is: \"Inner quest\" - $7, \"Plenty\" - $10 (must ship to the same address). \nAll pledges must be made in full during the campaign, so we wont allow late pledges or pledge upgrades. \nWe estimate that backers will get their rewards on March 2021.\nFor every 20 copies rewarded during this campaign, we will donate 1 copy to a public school or library.     \n Immense thanks to Alice Steel for her artistic contributions: \"Hygeia's cup\", body, organs, tissues, B-cell and the virus. Alice Steel is a qualified biologist and practicing artist with a lifelong belief that science and art work best together. As an illustrator her work is continually inspired by nature\u2019s creativity and aims to explore the important connections we have to our ecosystem. \nThanks to Catalina Mateus, Carolina Parra, Carolina Gomez and the great team at \"Globe Creative\" for their patient work on the graphic design of the game. \nI would like to thank all our Playtesters: Inna Rytsareva, Michael Bamford, Hernan Bernal, Seth Sims, Amanda Sue, Jorge Hernandez, Zoya Dimitrova, Armand Zakarian, Tatiana Chirkova, Irina Astrakhantseva, Pavel Skums, Olga Glebova, David Hinderer, Mason Wilde, Jared Strop, Craig McDaniel, Samuel Shepard, Ryan Brumbelaw, Christopher Laferty, Mike Yakubek and MARVIN (Mechanical Automaton of Randomly Valuable INtelligence).\nFinally, special Thanks to Inna Rytsareva (Campaign management, IT and community outreach), Santiago Campo (audio and video production), Melinda McDaniel (video narration and rules proofreading),  and Tony Cha (rules proofreading).    \nJuan Sebastian Romero: biologist, human rights defender, beloved friend. He was a brave, intelligent, selfless human being. I experienced first-hand the joy and curiosity of his noble nature while we studied Biology together.

Also to make it easier i'll include two big blue buttons.\nThis project is now our third Kickstarter, All previous works can be found here, on our Etsy page. Our last kickstarter was fully funded in 90 minutes and all stretch goals were unlocked in less than 24 hours! Also we will be working with the same manufacturer that produced our Menagerie of Monsters pins, we trust that they will produce the same high quality product that they did before.\nHow can I choose which pins I would like?\nWhen the campaign ends i will be sending out surveys where you will be able to select which pins you would like! \nWill I get a tracking number?\nMost rewards are sent out untracked due to the high price of tracked shipping here in the UK. If you would like tracking please add \u00a39 to your total pledge amount, as per my pricing list above. \nWill I be able to get these pins after the kickstarter has ended?\nYes! When this campaign ends i will order extra stock encase we have any B grade or none perfect pins, any of the left over pins will be put on my Etsy store, but they will be \u00a39 on there so backers will be getting a discounted price\nOnce you've chosen you're favourite little adventurers or decided to grab all of them, all that's left to do is sit back and relax whilst we get to work. The pin manufacturing process can take several weeks up to a month, depending on the amount of designs that are ordered, but we will be working with the same manufacturer that produced our last kickstarters pins, we trust them to be on time and deliver a high quality product. Then all that's left is assembly and postage, i can assure you i will be taking a couple weeks off of DnD to get all of your orders ready!\n July 20th - Campaign Begins\n August 20th - Campaign Ends\n Mid August - Surveys Sent out\n Last August - Funds arrive and production begins! \n Early October - Pins arrive with me\n Mid October - pins begin shipping\n Late October - All Pins Shipped\nInternational shipping may take an extra week or two\nNow onto the budget\n70% Production\n25% Shipping\n5% Kickstarter Fees", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis isn't my first kickstarter and i have been running an Etsy store for two years now so hopefully everything will run smoothly, the only risk we have falls to the pin manufacturer but i have been speaking to this company for a while and have made sure they can fulfil everything that we need.\nAlso all 12 of my pin designs have been checked by the manufacturer but they are still subject to minor changes like colour and details. If we do have to change anything i will put out an update to all backers. Also i will update you every step of the way!\nYou will only be able to pick from the pins we unlock\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a38 or more", "title": "1 Adventurer Pin", "descp": "One (1) enamel pin of your choice", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["31 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a315 or more", "title": "2 Adventurer Pins", "descp": "Two (2) enamel pins of your choice.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["26 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a321 or more", "title": "3 Adventurer Pins", "descp": "3 enamel pins of your choice", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["16 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a327 or more", "title": "4 Adventurer Pins", "descp": "4 enamel pins of your choice", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["11 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a333 or more", "title": "5 Adventurer Pins", "descp": "5 enamel pins of your choice", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["13 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a339 or more", "title": "6 Adventurer Pins", "descp": "6 enamel pins of your choice", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["8 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a345 or more", "title": "7 Adventurer Pins", "descp": "7 enamel pins of your choice", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["2 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a350 or more", "title": "8 Adventurer Pins", "descp": "8 enamel pins of your choice", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["2 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a355 or more", "title": "9 Adventurer Pins", "descp": "9 enamel pins of your choice", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["0 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a360 or more", "title": "10 Adventurer Pins", "descp": "10 enamel pins of your choice.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["1 backer"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a365 or more", "title": "11 Adventurer Pins", "descp": "11 enamel pins of your choice.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["0 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a370 or more", "title": "12 Adventurer Pins", "descp": "12 enamel pins of your choice.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["1 backer"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a374 or more", "title": "13 Adventurer Pins", "descp": "Thirteen (13) enamel pins of your choice.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["0 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a378 or more", "title": "14 Adventurer Pins", "descp": "Fourteen (14) enamel pins of your choice.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["12 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a3110 or more", "title": "20 Adventurer Pins", "descp": "20 enamel pins of your choice.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["3 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a37 or more", "title": "Early Bird -

We're making this dice collection available in lots of color schemes, with many font colors to choose from, and in some fantastic configurations - regardless of your preferred gaming system.\nThese 16mm plastic polyhedral dice feature our Signature Font which has a unique look with a bold print that's not only good looking, but they are also easy to read.\nPLAY\n\nCOLOR VARIATIONS AND SIGNATURE FONT\nWe've developed a large color assortment for this project, and we're happy to announce the availability of 20 unique color and font combinations.

Maybe you want to build a custom dice set for your characters, or maybe you need a unique color combination for your RPG system.  No matter the uniqueness, we can provide a custom dice collection that meets your exact needs.\nFor example, if you like the Red Color Spray Set with Black Font, but you want to add three D20 dice in the Blue Color Spray with White Font, you will want to select the reward for your dice set, then add on $6 for the three additional single dice ($2 each).\nIf you want a truly mixed and matched collection, choose the single dice reward, and multiply the number of dice in your collection by $2.  For example, if you want to build a custom 20 piece collection, you'll want to pledge $40 ($2 per die) under the Single Die Reward.\n\n7 AND 11 PIECE COLLECTIONS\n7 Piece Dice Sets - $10 each\n11 Piece Dice Sets - $14 each\n\n\nTEN COUNT MATCHING DICE COLLECTIONS \nTen Count Pack of Matching D20 Dice - Any Unlocked Color Variety\nTen Count Pack of Matching D12 Dice - Any Unlocked Color Variety\nTen Count Pack of Matching D10 Dice - Any Unlocked Color Variety\nTen Count Pack of Matching D8 Dice - Any Unlocked Color Variety\nTen Count Pack of Matching D6 Dice - Any Unlocked Color Variety\nTen Count Pack of Matching D4 Dice - Any Unlocked Color Variety\nTen Count Pack of Matching D00 Dice - Any Unlocked Color Variety\nWOODEN DICE DISPLAY AND STORAGE BOXES - LIMITED AVAILABILITY\nGood news backers!

In order to fully close this case, the Police have now released three items, containing over 90 puzzles and mysteries, and are calling on you to help solve them...\n You can play Full Deck several ways:\nBacking BOOKSHELF, which includes all three books\nBacking ONLOOKER (digital) or CRIME BOARD (physical), which is a self-contained puzzle\nBookshelf \nThree distinct books make up the Full Deck set.\nThis  is a collection of three books, each set inside a crime narrative, where you have to piece together the clues and solve the 90 puzzles contained within.\nThe books consist of:  \nA full-colour textured paperback book\nMasterpiece - Released by the Police, this is a facsimile copy of the serial killer's diary. Read through the diary and see if you can uncover their motivation, plans and other nefarious ideas. The diary is written in broken prose, so you will need to have your most cryptic, riddling minds active to solve the challenges contained within.  \n54 images of crucial evidence to solve the case.\nEvidence - 54 specific items of interest to the Police, from ticket stubs to menu orders and receipts. This is a self-contained puzzle book, as each item also gives clues to a specific playing card value and suit. The items contribute heavily to the storyline, and will give valuable clues to solving the other puzzles.\nThe Evidence book also has answer grids. The Full Deck series uses a brand new answer validation system (BinCheck), so you will not need access to a computer to see if you are correct. This book will be fully printed in colour.\nIf you'd like to have have the actual pieces of evidence, please look at our Crime Board or Expert Reward. \nA full colour, glossy journal.\nRedacted - A facsimile of the journal kept by the investigating Police Officer during the event. The pages have been written in detail, but you will need your powers of deduction (as well as some cross-referencing) in order to work out the information which has been redacted by the Police, for fear of reprisals or lawsuits. This book will be fully printed in colour.   \n Want to play the standalone game, with 54 pieces of facsimile evidence? Dust off your cork board, get your pins ready, and take a look at our Crime Board Reward...\n Crime Board \n54-pieces of facsimile evidence, from tickets stubs to crucial ephemera.\nAlso available is Crime Board. This is a physical collection of all the items of evidence, complete in a genuine evidence bag. Now is your chance to recreate your own crime board, by using these tickets, leaflets, photographs and receipts to build either a timeline of the events, or connect them together as a standalone puzzle.\nCrime Board has a game built into it - each of the 54 items has a playing card suit and value hidden within it, so can be played either on it's own (find all the playing cards), or as part of the Full Deck game (for example, seeking out a name that visited a specific location from one of the pieces of evidence).\nSome of the Crime Board elements in action!\nPlease note that the items in Crime Board are the same as those in the Evidence book, but we believe these add an exciting element to the game, and are perfect for a group of detectives to work through together! Below are some ways backers could play Crime Board:\nThose with books might find the places items are mentioned at or hinted towards, and put them in those sections of the book.\nBlu-tack a deck of cards on the wall, and see if you can place the right item on the right playing card (good for sifting evidence).\n\"Borrow\" a rolling whiteboard from work and create a visual timeline.\nClear the table, and have friends over to sift and sort the clues, uncovering all the puzzles (remember, this is a standalone game, AND can be used with the books).\nReward Options \nFor those on a budget, we are offering a digital-only copy of Evidence. If you love the idea of being your own detective, we are offering Crime Board, which is a physical collection of the evidence, supplied in a genuine evidence bag. For booklovers, you can back to get either the three copies on their own (Bookshelf Pledge), or you can upgrade to the Expert pledge, which includes all three books AND the Crime Board reward. Lastly, we have an extremely limited number of naming rewards available. Please note that these prices are below eventual retail prices.\nBackground\nThis has been created by Stephen, one half of The Escapages, publishers of Escape Books. We have published eight books so far, the most recent one, Flatpak, being successfully funded on Kickstarter in 2019. Flatpak was an interactive puzzle escape book in the guise of a furniture catalogue, and the full-colour print contained over 120 puzzles. \n\"As a lifelong fan of crime fiction and drama, I have always been most interested in the little details; the crime board of evidence, the whiteboard timelines, the little baggies of clues, the serial killer's diary. I felt that there was an extraordinary opportunity to build a pacy narrative simply by using these materials alone. The result is this; an incredibly complex intertwining set of storylines, combined with photorealistic detail and some deliciously-challenging puzzles.\"\nSee Stephen talk about Escapages and the Full Deck project here (18 minute video).\nSolve the riddles within the diary to help crack the case.\nDetails\nHow will the puzzles work?\nThere are three distinct types of puzzle included in Full Deck, outlined below. They are are ordered by difficulty, starting with the easiest.\nEvidence - In this book are photographs of 54 key pieces of evidence from the Full Deck crime story. Contained within each item is a clue or hint toward an ordinary playing card suit and value - including two jokers.\nRedacted - This book is the sleep journal of the investigating Police Officer, which has been check through by the Crown Prosecution Service, and key elements of the story have been redacted. The puzzles within this book rely on you drawing information from the journal itself, and Masterpiece.\nMasterpiece - our killer wrote his plans and thoughts in prose, list, diagrams and poetry. You will have to dig through the book, sometimes linking information from Evidence and Redacted, in order to solve the riddles and puzzles contained within.\nThe journal will guide you, if you can only solve the redacted sections...\nSchedule\nTo avoid any disappointment, we have created a schedule with enough breathing space to allow for any unforeseen minor delays, as outlined below. We aim to complete different milestones ahead of this, but hope that this gives some idea of what we are working toward.\nAugust - October 2020 Completion of the text for Masterpiece and Redacted.\nOctober 2020 Generation of the BinCheck grids. First Play test round.\nNovember 2020 Typesetting of all three books.\nDecember 2020 Printing of proof copies.\nJanuary 2021 Professional copy editing and proofreading. Play testing.\nFebruary 2021 Revisions made. Shipping costs and addresses confirmed.\nMarch 2021 Worldwide dispatch.\n\nStretch Goals\nWe have built two complimentary products for Full Deck - the books, and the crime board set. Below are the stretch goals for them both:\nAs you can see, there are dedicated upgrades for both the books and the crime board. Please bear in mind that if you pledge at EXPERT level, you are contributing to scores for both! If someone backs just the books, that is added to the Bookshelf tally, and so on.\nAt the time of writing, we are already over halfway to our first Stretch Goal for both, so please read below to see how we can achieve this faster than you might expect.\nWe are trying something a little different for this campaign, and asking you to really help get the word out about this project on Social Media. To that end, we have built in a Sharing Stretch range of rewards too!\nAll you have to do is share the above link (bit.ly/BackFullDeck), and we will do the rest. Every validated click counts, and will earn more puzzles for the book set. Plus, if/when we reach 2,000 validated clicks, we will include a customised pin badge for all physical backers!\nIf you have a large fanbase online and would like a customised bit.ly link, please do get in touch via our messages, and we can provide one bespoke for you. Please get in touch for more details.\n\nShipping\nPlease note that shipping is not included in your pledge, and will instead by charged after the campaign using a pledge manager. There will be the option of standard or tracked shipping. Shipping is likely to be around \u00a36 domestically, and \u00a310 internationally, and will be calculated near to dispatch based on current rates and accurate weights.

Starting with this Kickstarter, and continuing with future campaigns, locations in this setting will be brought to life as richly detailed 3D printable models, and an accompanying pdf will feature information on each location as it is released, including designer notes and development history over the years. This Kickstarter will feature locations such as the village of Dragonshire, excursions into the depths of Shadowgrove, unholy shrines deep within Vallis Mortis, the wight infested barrows of Barrowdeep, and much more! \nDRAGONLOCK\u2122 is an interlocking terrain system that allows you to create fully modular, multi-level 28mm scale village terrain for your RPG or wargame on your home 3D printer. Each set is delivered in a downloadable .stl format via our online distribution partner DriveThruRPG.com, and once you have the set, you can print as many pieces as you like and never run out or need to purchase more. These terrain sets represent the culmination of over fifteen years of gaming terrain design experience.\n PLEASE NOTE:\n All models optimized for printing on FDM 3D printers and do not require slicer  supports.  \nA starter 3D printer begins around $220 (see F.A.Q.)\n Each pledge level includes all previous pledge levels (each individual level delivers per its stated delivery date.) \nEach set delivers as a downloadable .stl file via DrivethruRPG.\n The optional Add-On sets shown below can be added to any pledge level by adding the appropriate amount to your core pledge. When the campaign ends, you will get a survey where you will select which add on sets you pledged for. \nWe do not use an after-campaign pledge manager. All pledges must be in by the end of the campaign. \n\nAll models shown below were printed on Creality Ender 3 and Ender 5 3D-printers. \nPreview of the upcoming Baba Yaga reward which is an EXCLUSIVE for campaign backers!\nLED illuminated Dracolich stretch reward\n\nBonus 3D-printable airbrush stencils for the timber frame buildings included!\n\n\nVALLIS MORTIS is Tom Tullis' home campaign world that players have explored (sometimes even surviving!) for over thirty years. For the first time ever, behind-the-scenes info for this fantasy campaign setting is being made public. As Vallis Mortis terrain sets are released, information about those locations and inhabitants will be added to the Vallis Mortis information pdf. Future Vallis Mortis Kickstarters will grow the terrain offerings for this setting, and the setting pdf will grow as well, expanding with each new Kickstarter campaign. This pdf is a FREE offering available to all backers. \nVallis Mortis cover painting by legendary TSR D&D artist Jeff Easley!\nVallis Mortis\u2122 map \u00a9Thomas A. Tullis\nStretch rewards are free to everyone pledging at the DRAGONSHIRE: Tall Roofs ($60) pledge level or higher. \nPhotoshop mockup of walls, this is not the final sculpt.\nPhotoshop mockup of walls, this is not the final sculpt.\nPhotoshop mockup of streets, this is not the final sculpt.\nNOTE: Final design of stretch reward models is subject to change as modifications may be necessary to ensure proper printing. \nDeathwalker first test print build. This model prints with absolutely NO SUPPORTS AT ALL!\nWe have a Youtube channel dedicated to teaching you how to set up a 3D printer, maintain it, and show you all the tips and tricks we've learned so you can print miniatures and terrain like a pro! Check it out HERE. \nAdd-ons are optional bundles of terrain sets not included in any of the core ledge levels. To receive these, you must add the price shown to your pledge. EXAMPLE: To get the $99 dungeon bundle shown below, you would need to add $99 to the total amount of whatever pledge level you wish to receive. Once the campaign is over, you will receive a survey from us where you will indicate which add-on sets your additional funds are intended for.\nAll pledges will be fulfilled via DrivethruRPG", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nFat Dragon Games is a small company, and we need to be careful what subjects we choose to proceed with for production. One or two poorly selling sets could hurt our company severely. By putting potential projects up on Kickstarter, we can be sure if there is demand for that subject before devoting our resources to it. We also get to connect directly with our customers, rewarding those who are early supporters for a set with cool stuff like exclusive pieces not available to customers who purchase the set later on, and free stretch rewards. We have been in the print-and-play terrain business for over 15 years, having released more than 200 terrain sets, and have had ten previous Kickstarter campaigns successfully funded and delivered so supporters of this project can feel completely confident in our ability to deliver a high-quality product as promised.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nLong-lasting design\nOur clip system was specifically designed to put all stress and wear on the tiny clip itself, not the terrain piece, so the terrain models will last an incredibly long time after years of use with no degradation of the clip port that would result in loosening of the fit.\nReusability and recyclability\nThe PLA plastic the end user will utilize to create these models at home can be broken down in an industrial composter as it is a bioplastic made from plants.\nSustainable materials\nWe only recommend the use of renewable bioplastics in the 3D printing process like PLA (Poly Lactic Acid) which is made from corn or sugar cane plants (thus not using oil like other plastics) and is a renewable resource.\nEnvironmentally friendly factories\nSince our product is produced by the consumer at home on a 3D printer, there is no factory required for the creation of these models. This eliminates the extensive amount of fossil fuels normally utilized in the mass production of products like this such as steel mold creation (large carbon footprint in the manufacturing of the steel) and the oil used in the injection molding process, plus shipping of final product is eliminated as well saving fuel and eliminating the carbon emissions of both container ships and land-based shipping trucks.\nSustainable Distribution\nFulfillment is digital, thus eliminating all carbon footprints related to the trans-oceanic and over-land shipment associated with physical products.", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 15 or more", "title": "DRAGONSHIRE STREETS", "descp": "This pledge features 26 street and sidewalk tiles delivered as a downloadable .stl file.

We're working hard to make sure that all components appear the same as shown in the prototype images. Please note that due to material availability and manufacturing processes, you may still see a slight difference (i.e. color saturation, paper texture.)\nAll the web components of the games are being hosted securely and all have backups, so you shouldn't worry about not being able to access them in the foreseeable future.\n\n\u2022 Art & Design\nWe're actively working on the creative part of Chapter One. To make sure there are no delays on the creative front, we've decided not to wait until the end of the campaign and we've already hired the illustrator & extra writing staff. If we reach certain stretch goals, there may be additional artwork to produce, but we don\u2019t foresee this causing any delays.\n\n\u2022 Shipping\nWe are planning to begin the shipping process immediately following the end of the campaign. We're doing our best to subsidize your shipping costs as much as we can, even if it means covering the whole fee for the package for Journey backers in USA & Canada and most of the shipping fee for the EU.\nDelivering hundreds of envelopes around the world is not an easy task, and we all understand there are many factors that could cause delays. This is why our biggest pledge for all 13 games offers most of the games to be shipped in one box. This way we majorly reduce the chances of one of your 13 envelopes to be lost, damaged, or delayed when sent as a letter mail.\nPlease note that if you're outside of US & Canada and you add the \"Almost Subscription\" add-on that offers all your 13 envelopes to be shipped separately, the shipping will be considered to be \u201cat your own risk\u201d, meaning we cannot be responsible for mishandled packages.\nAny issues with delivery will be handled individually and in-house. We're prepared to send replacements when it makes sense.\n\n\u2022 Additional Fees & Customs\nOne of the reasons we're heavily subsidizing our shipping costs is because VAT, customs, or other local shipping fees are unfortunately not covered and processed on our end. We currently have only twenty EU & Asian backers, so we are prepared to serve you personally and case by case.\nTo be more accessible for International backers of all 13 games, we added the \"Almost Subscription\" add-on that offers all your 13 envelopes to be shipped as letter mail, not in a box. According to our research, letter mail is exempt from VAT in most countries, so we're hoping this option will help you save some $.\n\n\u2022 Refunds\nAs of launch, we haven't found any pledge managers for post-campaign processing we're happy with, so we'll be handling everything in-house.\nYou are welcome to manage your pledge during the campaign (we really hope that 40 days are enough for you to make a final decision and we will make sure to send an update 48/24h before the end of the campaign to remind you to manage your pledge.) Once the campaign ends, we will send out final surveys and we will start the shipping process immediately. Once your order has been processed for shipping, we will no longer be able to offer refunds. \n\n\u2022 Unforeseen Events\nWhile we can't anticipate everything, we feel that we are prepared to deal with all the issues if and when they occur. We are committed to you all and will always keep you updated about any changes that might affect this project. We respect our backers and we have a moral obligation to ensure everyone receives what they pledged for.

Each of the 3 chapters takes about 2-3 hours to solve, totaling 6-9 hours of gameplay. \nPostCurious, the company behind the \u201cinsidiously clever\u201d puzzle adventure The Tale of Ord, invites you to be part of the story and uncover what many have sought for centuries: what hides in the glow of The Emerald Flame.   \nThe Emerald Flame requires no setup, and no complicated rules. You will need an internet-connected device for the use of a web browser, but there is no outside knowledge or research required.   \nExplore the objects, solve puzzles, and submit your solutions into an online chat to get responses in real time. If you get stuck on a puzzle, don\u2019t worry! You\u2019ll have a detailed online hinting system at your disposal should you need a nudge in the right direction.\n CLICK HERE TO VIEW THE RULES DOC \nThe base game will include a refill kit that will allow for one additional play-through by another group. UPDATE: Because we have hit a stretch goal, Kickstarter backers at the Junior Alchemist and up level will receive a 2nd refill kit. More on the refill kit below.   \nIt would mean so much to us if you would help us reach our funding goal by pledging for a copy of the game! We do also understand that everyone\u2019s circumstances are different in these uncertain times. As long as supplies last, Patron and Apprentice backers will be able to upgrade their pledge at a later date when things are hopefully more certain.    \nUPDATE: The enamel pin poll is open in update #8. Because we reached our $150k stretch goal, the winner of the poll will be included for Junior Alchemist backers, and BOTH pins will be included in the Apprentice Pack! \nJoin us for puzzles throughout the campaign! \nThe story of The Emerald Flame revolves around working with the Koschei Historical Society to analyze a legendary alchemist\u2019s work\u2026 but The Koschei Society first needs your help to find that work! You are being invited to join the investigation at its earliest stages and help them follow a series of clues that will hopefully lead to the location of the alchemist\u2019s hiding spot.   \nWe expect to find 5 artifacts, one of which will be posted on the Koschei Society forum every Wednesday evening, before being shared publicly on Thursdays in our campaign updates and on social media. You can join the forum to see the puzzles early and/or to solve them with others as a group!\nTo join the forum, find the two words hidden somewhere on this Kickstarter page. One will complete this link www.koscheisociety.org/__________ (10 letters) and the other will give you a 5-letter password (enter in lowercase) to access the page. Regardless of whether or not you join the forum, any backer who submits all 5 correct answers before the end of the campaign will be entered to win a special art prize! You can submit your answers at www.koscheisociety.org/submit.\nIf you're having trouble figuring out the password, take a look at the banner below and see if a tilt in perspective helps. :)   \nNow that we have hit our funding goal, we\u2019ve got lots of great stretch goals for The Emerald Flame, including upgraded components and additional items! You can help us reach them by sharing the project on social media - the more people we can get it out to, the more we can unlock all sorts of goodies! \n Share the project and follow at the links below! \nPostCurious Website\nFacebook\nInstagram\nTwitter\nBoard Game Geek\nAlways another puzzle! With The Emerald Flame in your hands you can discover 3 secret messages hiding in the box artwork.\nAbout the refill kit: Now that we have hit our first stretch goal, the refill kit will include one set of replacements for the non-reusable components, should you want to repackage and pass the game on to someone else. PDFs will be also be provided for the paper components in case extras are needed or if you are playing with a friend remotely. One of our next stretch goals is an additional copy of the refill kit, which would mean a total of 3 possible play-throughs of the game.    \nRest assured we did our best to find the most reliable and affordable shipping options we could, and are also subsidizing shipping to all regions by $3 USD. Please note that the chart below shows shipping estimates, and shipping will be charged after the campaign using a pledge manager. Depending on your location and postage prices at the time of fulfillment, it may be necessary to adjust the shipping cost by a small amount.   \n**Rest of the world disclaimer: We are willing to ship worldwide, but please note that countries not listed in the shipping chart above will be considered \u201cship at your own risk\u201d areas, meaning we cannot be held responsible for mishandled packages. COVID-19 guidelines have also forced the USPS to temporarily suspend shipping to certain countries around the world. We do not know when these restrictions will be lifted, and it\u2019s very possible this won\u2019t be relevant by the time rewards are shipped out, but for the time being we will not be able to ship to the countries on this list.\nTo streamline the process as much as possible and offer more affordable shipping to international backers, we plan to warehouse in the US and UK, partnering with Quartermaster Logistics for backers in the Americas, Oceania, and Asia, and GamesQuest for backers in the UK and Europe. Please note that while we are offering customs friendly shipping to USA, Canada, UK, EU, Australia, New Zealand, & China backers, we cannot be responsible for VAT or customs charges incurred outside of these regions. \nPlay The Emerald Flame in your language: The majority of puzzles in The Emerald Flame do not depend on language and the few that do require only a very basic understanding of English. To make The Emerald Flame more accessible to a global audience, we currently plan to translate all the text in the game to make playing in Spanish, German, and French as easy as possible. Players will be able to download a free PDF and read all the clues and letters in their chosen language while using the physical components to solve the puzzles. For other language requests feel free to reach out to us and if there is significant demand we will look into the possibility.\nJuega a The Emerald Flame (La llama esmeralda) en tu propio idioma: La resoluci\u00f3n de la mayor\u00eda de los acertijos de Emerald Flame no depende del idioma, y los pocos en los que es necesario basta con unas nociones b\u00e1sicas de ingl\u00e9s. De cara a hacer Emerald Flame m\u00e1s accesible a nivel global, estamos traduciendo todos los textos incluidos en el juego al espa\u00f1ol, para as\u00ed facilitar el juego en la medida de lo posible.

Um die Emerald Flame einem globalen Publikum zug\u00e4nglicher zu machen, \u00fcbersetzen wir den gesamten Text des Spiels, um das Spielen auf Deutsch so einfach wie m\u00f6glich zu gestalten. Die Spieler k\u00f6nnen ein kostenloses PDF herunterladen und alle Hinweise und Buchstaben in der von ihnen gew\u00e4hlten Sprache lesen, w\u00e4hrend sie die physischen Komponenten verwenden, um die R\u00e4tsel zu l\u00f6sen.\nJouez \u00e0The Emerald Flame (La Flamme d\u2019\u00c9meraude) dans votre langue : La plupart des \u00e9nigmes pr\u00e9sentes dans The Emerald Flame ne sont associ\u00e9es \u00e0 aucune langue et les quelques \u00e9nigmes qui le sont ne requi\u00e8rent que des connaissances de base de l\u2019anglais. Ceci dit, afin de rendre The Emerald Flame accessible au plus grand nombre et afin de vous offrir une exp\u00e9rience de jeu plus personnelle, nous avons d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de traduire tous les textes en fran\u00e7ais.

If everything goes according to plan we should be able to deliver MUCH SOONER than what is shown on this schedule, but due to the complexity of manufacturing this game and the current global circumstances, we are being overly cautious with our promised ship dates in case we encounter any unexpected delays.\nDesign and development - May 2018 - March 2020\nKickstarter campaign - May - June 2020\nKickstarter funds deposited, format files for printing - July 2020\nSampling and production - August 2020 - May 2021\nDelivery of The Emerald Flame & standard reward tiers - Aug 2021\nDelivery of Collector\u2019s Edition reward tiers - Sept 2021\nPlease note that due to the personalized nature of the Collector\u2019s Edition, delivery for these tiers will come shortly after the standard version. We hope you\u2019ll understand these will require a little extra time to get the special attention they deserve. \nWe want to be as transparent as possible with our funding. Although there have been many costs incurred throughout the development of the project, our funding goal includes only what we need to make the game and deliver it to you.

After working in the escape room industry, she was inspired to create her first game, The Tale of Ord, by her love of nature, mythology, and the journey of discovery that can be created through puzzles and gamified storytelling. The Emerald Flame follows this inspiration, and after nearly two years of development and meticulous crafting, Rita can\u2019t be more excited to finally bring it to Kickstarter and share it with the world. \nPLAY\n\nRita holds a BFA in Furniture Design from the Rhode Island School of Design and loves talking to other creators about making things.

These will be done immediately after the Kickstarter campaign ends while we wait for the funds so there should be no delays on the creative front. If we reach certain stretch goals, there may be some additional artwork to produce, but we don\u2019t foresee this causing any delay as it can be completed during the sampling phase.\n\nManufacturing \n\nThis will be PostCurious\u2019 first time working with a manufacturer, which comes with its own challenges. The Emerald Flame is a complex game to produce, so sampling with the factory may take some time. The production copy will be fully inspected by us to make sure everything looks and works the way it should. Please note that due to material availability and manufacturing processes, some components may appear different than shown in the prototype images. As with any project that has complex custom components, there is also a risk of changes or delays, which is why we\u2019ve factored in extra time for manufacturing. We want to make sure the game is perfect for all our backers, and will always keep you updated in case of any changes.\n\nShipping & Fulfillment\n\nDelivering hundreds of games around the world is not an easy task, and there are many potential factors that could cause delays. We\u2019ll be partnering with Quartermaster Logistics for backers in the Americas, Australia, and Asia, and GamesQuest for backers in the UK and Europe. Both companies are experts in the field and we have full confidence in their ability to troubleshoot whatever obstacles may arise. Please note that while we guarantee customs friendly shipping to USA, Canada, UK, EU, AU, NZ & China backers, we cannot be responsible for VAT or customs charges incurred outside of these regions. Please also note that shipping will be charged after the campaign, and the numbers shown in the shipping chart are estimates only.\n\nCountries not listed in the chart of the \u201cshipping\u201d section above on this page are considered to be \u201cship at your own risk\u201d areas, meaning we cannot be responsible for mishandled packages in those regions. It is unclear how Brexit will affect shipping into the EU, but we\u2019ve been assured by GamesQuest that there are contingency plans in place should the outcome create obstacles in fulfillment. We do not expect this to affect anyone\u2019s rewards, but we will keep you posted if any changes occur. \n\nUnforeseen Events\n\nThroughout this process there is always a large number of variables at play, and many factors that could cause delays or changes. This could include severe weather, a global pandemic, or other unexpected circumstances. It is impossible to predict the outcome of such events or how they might affect the production of this project, but we will do everything we reasonably can to make sure the rewards are produced and delivered as promised. We are 100% committed to our backers and will always be sure to notify you with any changes that might affect this project\u2019s content, timeline, shipping, or otherwise. \n\nRefunds \n\nRefund requests received within 14 days of the end of the Kickstarter will be honored in full. Refunds requested after two weeks have passed will be subject to a 15-20% cancellation fee due to Kickstarter fees and administrative expenses. Once your order has been processed for shipping, we will no longer be able to offer refunds. Please note that anyone who does not complete the pledge manager by our required deadlines will not be eligible for a refund, and may encounter delays in receiving their rewards. \n\nBy pledging to this project you are indicating that you understand and give consent to the risks, challenges, and pledge terms laid out above.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Watchful Eye", "descp": "Just curious?

Together as a team you must collect a certain number of gems, reach the exit and Escape, all before the temple collapses, and the game ends.\nEach player explores their temple by entering chambers and gaining bonus actions and gems for the whole team. The special colored chambers require players to work together. They must occupy both chambers of the same color, in the same round to unlock two gems at once. A daunting task but worth it!\nPlayers can select from different difficulty levels and variants to tailor the game to their group. Cooperation, communication, and a bit of luck rolling the dice is needed to gain the required number of gems and reach the exit before the time runs out.\nThe setup of the game is very easy. One adventure sheet is placed in the middle, and depending on the difficulty level, the goal on the gem track is marked. Each player takes a temple sheet, an adventurer, and a pen. A start player is determined and takes 8 dice. Then each player chooses a different direction from which they want to enter the temple. Done!\nGame round\nA round is played in clockwise direction beginning with the start player. The active player takes all uncursed dice, rolling them two at a time until all are rolled. After each roll they must decide if they want to keep the rolled symbols or place them in the common pool. But if a black mask is rolled, it is placed on the adventure sheet. These dice are cursed and locked from being rolled for three turns.\nThe active player's goal is to enter chambers on their temple sheet, collecting gems, and bonus actions. They can move their adventurer to adjacent chambers if they have the required symbols. In each chamber they gain the bonus depicted, which is then crossed out and transferred to the adventure sheet. \nOnce the active player has used all their dice, or cannot use any more, the other players divide the dice in the common pool among them. With these dice they try to fulfill the treasure maps on their temple sheet. A treasure map is complete if they cross out all the required symbols, gaining a gem, and a bonus action for the whole team that is recorded on the adventure sheet.\nThe adventure sheet keeps track of the collected gems, game rounds, bonus actions (available and used), as well as locked dice (black masks). Available bonus actions (a box with a circle) can be used by the active player to move around their temple. If an action is used it is then crossed out. \n Overview of the bonus actions: \nWhen players have collected the required number of gems, it is time to run for the exit in the center room of the temple. Everybody has to be in that chamber before the end of the final round in order to Escape!\nEscape Roll & Write offers lots of replay-ability with various difficulty levels to tackle, and two different temple/adventure layouts to explore! \nThe dice shrine chambers can be used with the Escape base game, offering additional challenges.  These chambers are exclusive to Queen Games.  They are available from this Kickstarter, and if there are any left in the production run, we will sell them at Fairs/Conventions, or via our webstore.  \nTo play with the new shrine chambers, 8 dice from the Roll & Write are required. Once a chamber is discovered two dice are rolled and placed on the shrines. Adventurers who enter the chamber can roll the needed icons to get either a gem, or one of 4 different special effects. The die is then removed to indicate it has been used. These chambers can also be played with any combination of expansions or Queenies.\nEscape Queenie Box: 11 - 16\nAll Queenies that were released after the Escape Big Box 2nd Edition in one convenient box!\n11 \u2013 The Cursed Gems\n12 \u2013 The Slide\n13 \u2013 The Map\n14 \u2013 The Wishing Well\n15 \u2013 New Quests\n16 \u2013 New Traps\nWith this and the Big Box, players will have everything that is available for Escape. \nThe Escape Queenie Box is also a great addition for players who only own the base game and want new modules to add to their adventures.\nQueenie 11: The Cursed Gems is already included in the Big Box, but is such a popular Queenie that we wanted to include it for all players to enjoy.\nQueenie 11: The Cursed Gems\nAdventurers beware! You are in possession of a cursed gem and must find the matching gem inside the temple, or you cannot escape. You and your fellow adventurers must search the temple for matching gems and get rid of them. This Queenie adds another challenging layer and is, therefore, for experienced players.\nQueenie 12: Slide\nThis Queenie comes with two chambers and a curse. The slide chamber is a tricky one, because you can enter it for free from the staircase side. But if you want to enter the chamber from the other side, you have to roll 3 torches. So you better be sure before using the slide too often.\nThe debris chamber is interesting since in order to discover this chamber a player not only has to roll two adventurer icons but also a key and a torch.\nAnd finally, the Cyclops curse makes you cover one of your eyes with your hand and leave it there until the curse is lifted. Sounds easy, but rolling with one hand and moving your adventurer with limited vision is very tricky!\nQueenie 13: Map\nThe map chamber is a great destination for players since it is one of the few chambers that actually help the players and make the escape a little bit easier. Inside the chamber a player can roll 2 torch icons and then place their adventurer in any chamber they want, allowing the player to quickly navigate the temple and help other players.\nQueenie 14: Wishing Well\nThis chamber also helps the players succeed. If you roll 2 key icons, you may either draw a treasure, get rid of a curse, or regain one of your lost dice! And you can use the wishing well multiple times... But only one wish at a time, so you have to leave the chamber and reenter if you want to use it more than once\nQueenie 15: New Quests\nNow players must fulfill quests, which are special chambers, where they have to work together to overcome a challenge, otherwise they cannot escape. Each game players can decide if they want to tackle one, two or even three quest chambers.\nQueenie 16: New Traps\nTrap chambers are especially nasty since the adventurer must be placed inside the chamber upon discovery. Now they are trapped until they figure a way out or another adventurer helps them. There are 3 trap chambers in this Queenie. How many are you prepared to handle in your next game?\nAdd-Ons \nFor backers who may have missed our recent campaigns or planned on getting the games at the Gen Con 2020 or Spiel 2020 (unfortunately neither of which will take place this year). We would like offer another opportunity to get Winter Kingdom here in this campaign, and Merlin Big Box, among others, in the pledge manager.\nPledging for this Campaign\nProduction for this campaign is planned for Q4  2020.  To ensure that shipping goes as smoothly as possible we are using Crowd Ox Pledge Manager.   \nEscape Base Game\nEscape: The Curse of the Temple is a real-time cooperative game in which all players must escape from a temple after awakening an ancient curse. The game plays in precisely 10 minutes, with an included soundtrack (also available digitally) counting down the game. Players must navigate through the temple by rolling dice and matching symbols to rooms, thereby gaining entry and visibility into adjacent rooms. The map of the temple will unfold as the players explore, making every game play different.  At certain points a countdown starts, and if players aren't back in the safe room when time is up, they will become \"lost\" and lose one of their dice. \nBig Box 2nd Edition\nMore content means more challenges to overcome. The Big Box includes the Base Game, 8 Expansion modules (originally released as three expansion boxes) and 10 Queenies (single expansion modules):\nModule 1: Curses\nModule 2: Treasures\nModule 3: Illusion chambers\nModule 4: Special chambers\nModule 5: Quest chambers\nModule 6: Characters\nModule 7: Trap chambers\nModule 8: Time chambers\nTen (10) Queenies. See the graphic for the names of each\nProduction and Delivery\nThe production of Escape Roll & Write as well as Escape Base Game and Escape Big Box 2nd Edition is planned for the end of October 2020. Our games are printed in Europe, so there is little delay between the end of printing and them arriving for fulfillment in our warehouse. Pledges to the US will most likely be sent via container to a fulfillment center. Please note that all shipping projections are our best estimates only, and not guarantees.\nWe offer \"friendly\" shipping to a number of zones around the world, including the United States, Canada, and the European Union. If your country is not listed as \"friendly,\" Queen Games is not responsible for any local charges, customs fees, or if a local carrier (i.e. not the carrier we shipped by) loses your package. In these cases, we are not able to reimburse you for any charges.\nPost Campaign Communication\nWe will monitor the comment section and messages while the campaign is active in order to answer everyone's questions. Please note that, since we do not have a full time employee dedicated to Kickstarter alone, we may not be able to actively monitor the comments after the campaign closes. If you have a question about your pledge, please send us a message.\nWe will do our best to post all pertinent information in a timely manner either as an update or in emails to relevant backers.\nTerms and Conditions\nBy pledging for this product, you are accepting the following terms.\nREFUND POLICY Following the terms of Kickstarter, Queen Games will provide a full refund provided the request is received within 14 days of the close of the campaign.If a request is made after this period, any refund would be at the discretion of Queen Games, and would be a maximum of 85% based on incurred fees and handling costs.\nDAMAGED OR INCOMPLETE PRODUCTS We understand that all backers want to receive their items in pristine condition; however, the realities of worldwide shipping can sometimes make this difficult. We guarantee that the product you receive will be complete and all internal components in perfect condition. We will do our best to ensure that your package arrives in good condition, but all decisions on box replacements will be made on a case by case basis. Due to the difficulty and expense in replacing boxes, depending on your region, we will not be able to replace some boxes with minor cosmetic damage only.\nRETURNED PRODUCTS If you refuse to accept your package on arrival we will not issue you a refund for the cost of the pledge.\nFAILURE TO RESPOND TO SURVEY We will send a survey out to backers to collect addresses. If you fill out the survey after the designated time frame, your package may be delayed in sending to you by up to a months. If you do not fill out the survey until after the declared end of the project, we may not be able to send it to you.\nREASONABLE CHANGES TO PRODUCT By pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the name, final look, and materials of the project are subject to change and may differ from what is presented while the Kickstarter campaign was active. Queen Games will make all reasonable efforts to make the final product congruent with what is presented in the campaign, and to inform backers of the reasons for necessary changes.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nQueen Games is a company with over 30 years of experience to it's name. We know about the Kickstarter challenges, such as coordination of production from multiple manufacturers, delays with production and shipping, challenges with shipping around the world and missing or lost packages. Also, despite sending the rewards at the same time, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others because of logistics of international shipping. By pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the name, final look and materials of the project and hence the rewards, are subject to change and may differ from what is presented while the Kickstarter campaign was active.

I'm Michelle, the human behind Pollia Design, where you'll find an eclectic mix of fun and uplifting t-shirts, enamel pins, and other accessories.\nA board game convention was my doorway into the wide world of enamel pins, but I can hardly find any specific, niche board gamer pin collections out there. So I decided to make one!\nThis collection of 15 PINS celebrates some of the unique Board Game mechanics and genres. Wear them prominently and you may just find someone new to add to your game group :)\nWhy Order Through Kickstarter?\nThis is a HUGE and exciting set of pins that I would frankly not be able to produce without the campaign funds, so if the pins aren't funded here, they won't exist AT ALL!\nBy backing this campaign, you will get not just the pins, but bonus board game stickers for FREE!\nWhile funded pins will later be available in my shop, you'll never see prices as low as the bundles you see here.\nThe Pins\nThe main funding goal of $300 covers this first tier \"Board Gamer\" pin. Each additional $300 raised after that funds and unlocks another pin that you will be able to pick as a reward!\nEach of these pins will be made with :\n Black Nickel metal plating\n 2 pinbacks with clear rubber clutches to avoid spinning and keep your pin secure\nWhite, grays, and a color pop of these playful, bright colors (except for the first pin, which gets ALL the colors!) These were designed with pantone colors to ensure accuracy in manufacturing, but please note that all screens display colors a little differently.\nHard Enamel\nIn case it's hard to picture 33 mm, you can reference the pin size with these scale paper models, which my husband immediately laminated using his print-and-play crafting skills :\nFreebie Stickers\nThese 4 stickers will be unlocked alongside the pins in the campaign and included for FREE according to your reward level! They will be sturdy, glossy stickers, 2.5 in. tall, on heavy duty vinyl. You will be able to add more stickers to your reward later, if you so choose.\n(Update: we have surpassed $3600, so all of the stickers are unlocked and available for you!)\nSticker Sheet\nThis sticker sheet is unlocked from the get-go and includes sticker versions of all of the 15 pin designs. These individual stickers are ~1.3 in. tall, the same size as their pin brethren. (You'll also be able to add these to your reward later in the survey if you want.)\nTimeline\nAll of the design files have been perfected and the pins and stickers are ready to be sent forward with the push of a button. My manufacturing partner, who did a wonderful job producing my previous four pins, has already seen the design proofs and quoted me for their production. Despite the current overall-bananas global situation, I have developed this conservative timeline:\nMay - June: This campaign will be live\nLate June: Surveys sent out\nJuly: Funds received, pins and stickers begin manufacturing\nAugust: Completed pins and stickers shipped to me and I begin checking them for quality and packaging them up for you\nLate August/September: Rewards sent out!\n(A note on international shipping: I am planning to use USPS First Class International Package service to save you all some cash, but it may take the pins a week or two longer to reach you. If you're extra eager, contact me and we can get you some more expensive, but faster, shipping.)\nFunding Breakdown\nOf the initial $300 funding goal - covering the \"Board Gamer\" pin and sticker sheet - the budget breaks down as follows:\n70% Manufacturing costs for pins and stickers\n20% Shipping costs\n5-10% Kickstarter Fees\nSome of the main sketches that led to pins!\nThis is a massive set of pins, and I want you to be able to get all of the different genre pins you want! The best way to be sure that your most-loved pin gets unlocked is to share this campaign with all of your board game night regulars and tabletop simulator friends! You can find posts to share on my instagram and twitter pages @polliadesign (and also a lot of other sketches and fun designs, if you feel like browsing!)\nThank you so much for supporting this campaign, these pins truly cannot become a reality without each and every one of you! And a special thank you to the elite board gamers of Pittsburgh who helped guide these pins toward their final forms :)\n\nYou can see an example of one of the pins I've made this year from the same manufacturing partner I intend to use again! You can find more pictures in my shop here.\n\"Dragon's D20\" hard enamel pin with glitter", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLet's address the elephant in the planet - yes, the coronavirus makes everything unpredictable. But I am launching this project now, as my manufacturer shows no sign of closing down, and these pins should be produced and shipped out before any second wave of the virus has a chance to wreak mayhem. Even in the event of some other issues out of my control, the worst case scenario will be a delay.\n\n(I never would have thought I would need to put this disclaimer, but here goes: In the event of a worldwide governmental collapse or apocalypse, it may be a substantial delay before you get these pins. But I will do everything in my power to get them to you!)\n\nAs far as other risks and challenges - They are minimal. I have the experience of making a few pins in the past to guide me, I am using pantone colors to make sure the pins will look very close to the previews you see above, and am partnering with a trusted manufacturer who has already quoted the pins.\n\n*Backers are responsible for any customs and import taxes that may apply once the packages are out of my hands.

The metal used will be dark gray reflective nickel to highlight the borders and make them shine. We will be using a silkscreen printing method to allow the final prodcut to keep as much details are possible.\nThere are three different pledge tiers you can get. The adventurer tier is great for individuals who want to rep their favorite class and get a single pin. The party tier comes with 5 pins at a reduced price, enough to deck out your whole party or keep for yourself if you just really like pins. The last tier offers an even better value for you! The collector tier gets you all 13 pins at an even better price per pin. \nIf you want to get more pins just add 8\u20ac (or $9) to your pledge level for each extra pin that you want. \nWhile all of the art for the pins is finished there are still a few things that need to be taken care of. First is making sure that all the pins look good when manufactured. We're going to double check the designs to ensure the manufacturer can make them look just as amazing as they can be.\nAfter that I can give the manufacturer the okay to start making the pins. They'll get shipped over to me and I'll start packing your pins so that we can get them out to everyone. All in all I'm estimating that it will take about 4 months to get them to everyone.

She is a sensible and loving presence in Sherlock\u2019s life, something of a grounding influence.

In between, thou art but a blade. A blade I forged for killing.\nSo kill, Drifter.\nKill, and live to see the next nightmare.\nEverything you have ever experienced has been just one reality. The prime reality. However, many more exist within the infinite realms of the Drift, throughout which the dreams of every living creature in the universe are interwoven.\nFor Poppy, a lonely young girl with severe narcolepsy, these myriad worlds are a cherished escape from her own. But that all changes when she meets a mysterious black cat and learns of the nightmares that dwell within the Drift. These nightmares are not just fleeting figments of horror, but a corrupting darkness that infests every realm they touch.\nWhen the spread of nightmare threatens to overtake the Drift and infect dreamers in the prime reality, only Drifters like Poppy have the ability to hunt them down and slay them once and for all. But can Poppy truly stand up against the demons that threaten to destroy her reality...when those demons are her own?\nDarkdrifters is a fantasy novel series about dark horror and bright love, the power of imagination, and discovering self-worth.\n\"What is the Drift?\"\nI can\u2019t answer that. At least, not in any way that you might find satisfactory. The Drift is real, and yet it is an illusion. It is everything you and I have ever experienced, and also nothing at the same time. It is completely meaningless, and yet it is absolutely vital.\nThis may sound like a riddle, but it is all true. The Drift is a place that exists in all of our dreams\u2014or perhaps it is more accurate to say that our dreams take place within the Drift and its infinite realms. Dreams of sorrow and regret. Dreams of hope and ambition. Dreams of fantasy and imagination. And then, there are the Nightmares.\nNightmares aren\u2019t just fleeting figments of horror. They are corrupting influences that can infest other realms. When the spread of Nightmare threatens to overtake the Drift and infect the prime reality, only those beings who can travel from one dream to the next can draw in the Nightmare and slay it once and for all. These Drifters live by a simple mantra:\nProtect the Drift. Slay the Nightmare. Free the Mara. Do not go Dark.\nThe Drift is a world of dreams\u2014A vast multiverse that exists parallel to our own reality, which Drifters call the prime reality. The Drift is comprised of an infinite number of realms called demesnes. Creatures that sleep end up in the Drift, traveling through their subconscious thoughts, or traversing the Jungian collective wisdom and creativity of humanity. But there are dark thoughts that dwell within the Drift: nightmares that seek to infest all dreams and seep into the prime reality.\nOnly Drifters, cursed with the ability to travel between the myriad demesnes of the Drift, can hunt these nightmares down and slay them before they infect dreamers and begin the cycle anew. But nightmares are not so easily slain...and every encounter a Drifter has with their inner darkness could transform them into the very thing they hunt.\nThe Key and the Crescent is both a whimsical fantasy adventure and a psychological thriller. Can Poppy slay the nightmare and set things right? Or will she become its next victim?\nStill not convinced? \nRead this sample chapter RIGHT NOW!\nIf you pledge at the Dreamer level ($3), you'll help pay for my next latte. You will not receive a copy of The Key and the Crescent, but you will receive my eternal gratitude.\nIf you're looking to snag yourself a copy of The Key and the Crescent, it is available in three formats:\nIf you pledge at the Drifter level ($10), you'll receive a link to download the digital version of The Key and the Crescent, DRM-free, in several different formats (.mobi, .epub, and .pdf). This can be downloaded an unlimited number of times and transferred to any device you own. (Estimated delivery date: August.)\nAt the Darkdrifter level ($20), you'll receive the above download from the Drifter tier, along with a 6\"x9\" paperback edition of The Key and the Crescent shipped to you. Shipping costs will be added to your pledge amount. (Estimated delivery date: September.)\nAt the Black Cat level ($40), you'll receive the digital download from the Drifter tier, along with a signed 6\"x9\" hardcover edition of The Key and the Crescent with a sleek dust jacket. Again, as noted above, shipping costs will be added to your pledge. (Estimated delivery date: September.)\nFinally, at the very limited Chancel-maker level ($80), you'll receive everything from the Black Cat tier, and your signed copy of The Key and the Crescent will come with a personalized message just for you. Then I'll work with you to write a short 2-3k word short story wherein a Drifter stumbles into your very own dream or nightmare, which I'll publish in a future KS campaign update. Lastly, you'll get a sneak peek into future Darkdrifters series content! (Estimated delivery date: September.)\n(Note: Keep in mind shipping costs can be expensive, especially for backers outside of the US! Sadly, this is out of my control.)\nAdd-Ons / Additional Copies\nInterested in purchasing more than one copy of The Key and the Crescent? Not a problem! Simply pledge at the desired level and multiply your pledge amount by the number of copies you desire. For example, if you want two copies of the hardcover edition, pledge at the Black Cat level and add an additional $40 (for a total of $80).\nAs shipping multiple copies to a single person will inflate shipping costs, please limit your purchase to a maximum of three copies. If you want more than three copies, feel free to contact me personally and we can figure something out!\nWhy Kickstarter? In short, this is a passion project for me. This story is very near and dear to my heart, so it is important to me that I retain creative control over the endeavor, which is why I have opted to self-publish for now. However, there are a lot of costs associated with writing and publishing a novel: artwork, graphic design, editing, proofreading, printing, and shipping, to name a few. I'm not really looking to make money off of this Kickstarter\u2014my goal is simply to get this story out into the world. In other words, excess money raised by this Kickstarter (that is, money raised beyond its funding goal) will go towards making The Key and the Crescent even better.\nThe Key and the Crescent currently has some wonderful cover art by vacuum-chan / Sofiia Drozdova, which you can see above, and some preliminary editing. If The Key and the Crescent is funded, I will be hiring an editor out-of-pocket to make sure it is the best it can be. But with enough funding, we can do even more.\nBoring $$$ Stuff \nWhen backing a Kickstarter, it's always important to know where your money is going and how it is being spent. Here is the breakdown of how the initial funding goal of $4250 is to be spent.\nFirst are the production costs. If the project is funded, I'll be ordering\u2014at minimum\u2014300 paperback copies of The Key and the Crescent, costing ~$2373, and 60 hardcover copies, costing ~$1040. Due to the way bulk production works, these copies would first be shipped to me before being shipped individually to backers. This initial shipment would cost ~$188 for the 300 paperbacks and ~$67 for the hardcovers. All copies of The Key and the Crescent are being produced through Lulu.com, a well-known self-publishing service.\nThe hardcover editions will also come with posters that should run about $94 (production + shipping) and bookmarks for ~$30.\nFinally, Kickstarter requires 10% in additional fees, so a little over $420 more on top.\nThis all adds up to about $4,212\u2014just slightly under our funding goal!\nOf course, other factors can and will change these numbers. In general, the more backers we have, the lower the per-unit costs will be. I will strive to keep backers updated on any and all developments that might affect production and shipping costs.\nNote: this section does not factor in your own shipping costs\u2014those costs will be added onto your pledge and therefore aren't a factor in whether The Key and the Crescent is successfully funded.\nWith your support, I would love to make The Key and the Crescent even better. Depending on how much money we are able to raise beyond the project's funding goal, my intent is to use this support to improve the book in various ways.\n$7,000: Instead of the one editor, I can afford to hire a full suite (a developmental editor, a copyeditor, and a proofreader) in order to ensure that The Key and the Crescent is top-notch.\n$10,000: I will commission four new B&W art pieces for the interior of The Key and the Crescent, to be used at the start of each act of the book.\n$16,000: The big one \u2014 I will hire a professional voice actor to record an audiobook format for The Key and the Crescent.\nI may add more social or community-based goals as the campaign progresses, as well. Stay tuned to my twitter account for more details! https://twitter.com/NatsunoYoru\nAdditionally, it is worth noting that more editing and artwork may delay the physical release of The Key and the Crescent. Again, I will make sure you always have an up-to-date timeline!\nTales of the Drift\nAs a special thank you for your swift and unwavering support, I've decided to add an additional reward to this project. Tales of the Drift is a short story collection composed of all of the personalized short stories from the \"Chancel-maker\" pledges, along with one or more other short stories I've written in the Darkdrifters universe. It will come in a 6\"x9\" saddle-stitched booklet or a perfect-bound softcover, depending on its final page count, and will be included in every Darkdrifter ($20), Black Cat ($40), and Chancel-maker ($80) pledge, at no additional cost. Additionally, all backers (including at the $10 Drifter tier) will also receive Tales of the Drift in DRM-free digital formats (.mobi, .epub, and .pdf). I'll also be posting each story individually, below, as they are finished.\nThank you all for your support!\nEpisode One: The Dream of the Wonder Wheel\nGreetings! My name is Matthew Newman, author of The Key and the Crescent and lead developer of Arkham Horror: The Card Game. \nFirst off, thank you so much for checking out my Kickstarter. While this is my first time attempting to self-publish a novel, I've been writing stories pretty much ever since I could hold a pen. Darkdrifters is a setting I have had in my head for years, and it is an absolute dream come true to see it become a reality. I'm really excited (and simultaneously terrified) for people to finally get their hands on it. I hope you enjoy reading it as much as I have enjoyed writing it.\nMy credentials include insomnia, existential dread, and jumping whenever I see a spider.\nMore Darkdrifters!\nDiscord server: https://discord.gg/ZGbpbvU\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/NatsunoYoru\nCredits\nAll artwork is by vacuum / Sofiia Drozdova.

While I am confident I will be able to ship rewards to all backers without too much trouble, there may be hiccups in the timeline, and things may be delayed depending on how much additional content I decide to add based on the success of the Kickstarter. Additionally, depending on how long editing and proofreading takes, the timeline may change. Finally, the situation with COVID-19 may end up delaying production and shipping.\n\nLastly, I am just one person, not a whole publishing company, so depending on how many people want physical copies of the book, it may take longer than expected for things to ship.\n\nOf course, I will be sure to communicate all of this to you at every stage, so you are fully aware of these issues as they arise.\n\nThank you for understanding! \u2665\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 3 or more", "title": "Dreamer", "descp": "Don't want a copy of the book, but want to support me anyway?

Special appearances, more playable races (and subraces) and new backgrounds. What you get:\n Appearances - You are able to customize a lot of stuff on your character like face, hairstyle, hair color, eye color, clothes, scars, war paints, pedestals, and other accessories... And you get a lot of them, for free. But with CBP, you will get even more and much fancier options to tweak your character.\n Races - We are planning to launch our app with the 9 base races from 5e OGC DnD. These will be free. And we plan to release a DLC from time to time, introducing a new lands and with them, new races. For example, if you unlock the 5th tier of social goals, you get a Demonic race. Pure blooded demons with (for starters) 3 subraces. From those 2 would be free and 1 premium. So with each content update, you get a bunch of free stuff, but also some premium. The premium stuff will be available to those with CBP.\n Classes - For classes in CBP applies the same as for races.\n Backgrounds - With CBP you get a few new backgrounds, which will get special attention and be perfected to the last line.\nWorld Builder Pass (WBP) Subscription\nAccess exclusive terrains and map objects for your adventure. Create epic battles with premium monsters that have special skills and prepare more entertaining situations with more specialized items (like an expanded fishing set, etc.).

Stuff that you don't use every day, but will make your campaign stand out\n Location Map - The same as on the world map. Except there is more to work with. For example, when building dwarven tunnels, WBP will include stuff like cart rails or beautiful lamps for the walls\n Monsters - You will get premium versions of some monsters. Like ancient skeletons in magical armor or some brand new creatures that our artists will come up with a tweak to the last detail\n Ready-made adventures - Yes, there will be free adventures, but the really well worked out (and that will be most of them) will usually have free beginning only  (so that you can try them out), but the rest you'll have to buy. With WBP you have access to all of them.\n Items - Well this is a section with a loooot of content. Premium items will be for example some magical sets of armor or weapons. But also quite normal things like more tools for fishing, more kinds of fishes or stuff like that. Things that you don't need for running an adventure, but you need them to run YOUR epic adventure.\n Discord Role: FANatic \u2022 You get a unique role on our Discord server that is available only to Kickstarter backers.\nExclusive Kickstarter badge for your in-game characters \u2022 Honorable distinction exclusively for our backers.

Friendships and memories built through role-playing are more than any casual game will ever be able to give you. \ud83d\udd25    \nCollaborative story-telling with your friends is like reading a book, but the next chapter isn\u2019t written until you decide what you wanna do. And you can do anything. \ud83c\udf0c\nWe are going to bring this experience to phones. Not only as a new app to download but as a completely new thing that wasn\u2019t here before. We believe that thanks to automized rules and a worldwide game-player matching will even more people find the beauty of role-playing.\n No startup plan is ever perfect, so this is subject to change, but we will do our best to stay the course. \n There are so many amazing people in our community \ud83d\udc68 - and you can join them right now. \nWe\u2019re Fireball Studios, a mobile gaming studio based in Prague. Our operations started in the summer of 2019 and since then we\u2019ve been working hard on Fireball RPG, the mobile role-playing app. \ud83d\udcf1\n\nOur expertise ranges from iOS & Android development to game design, UX design and art direction. \ud83c\udfa8\n\n     All team members are passionate gamers. Sometimes we spend a whole evening playing the old-school Heroes of Might and Magic III. We also play Dark Souls, Borderlands, or even World of Warcraft.\n\n     We love tabletop roleplaying games too! Our favorite is D&D (5th Edition), but we also like Pathfinder, Shadowrun, or Fate. We have a 4 hour-long session every Monday.\nWe just wanna prove to the world that mobile gaming that goes beyond neverending candies crushing can not only succeed but even create new friendships and communities. \ud83d\udc99\n\n      We believe role-playing can beat casual games and there is a demand for a mobile role-playing platform. We want to prove this with a  successful Kickstarter campaign.\nThe best games are created by the best teams. We plan to use your money to scale our studio. Having more people working full time on this will accelerate the development and it will enable us to produce even better art in larger quantities. Long story short, we\u2019d like Fireball to reach its full potential. \ud83d\ude80\n\nWe\u2019ve already spent over $100,000 developing this app. If you enable us to blow up here, we will have an easier time approaching new investors and publishers.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nNo one has tried to automize complicated role-playing rules to the mobile platform before. We\u2019ve been working on this since summer 2019 and we think we understand it well, but creating a completely new platform with reworked game mechanics might bring challenges, we\u2019re not aware of yet and those might slow down development. We\u2019ve tried to mitigate this by assembling a strong team with experience in shipping AAA mobile apps used by millions every day. \ud83d\udc68\n\nWe have private investors, who can support us for a long time allowing us to develop the platform and put it on app stores. The only real risk is that we\u2019ll ship the product late. In that case, we\u2019ll consider releasing sooner without non-critical features and we\u2019ll add them in later updates. However, we\u2019ll do everything we can to prevent this and give you the ultimate role-playing experience by the end of a year. \ud83d\udcaf\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nSomething else\nWe\u2019re respectful of the environment in our headquarters in Prague.

They have raised metal lines forming the 'line art' and the recessed sections between the lines are filled with colorful hard enamel.  Then the whole thing is polished smooth!\nAn example of a pin I previously designed, the Kitty Reaper\n Above you can see the front, side and back of the Kitty Reaper, a pin I designed and had produced earlier this year!  The back of the pins have pointed posts with rubber clutches to hold the pins in place when worn.\nPins I have designed worn on a jacket, a lanyard and a small backpack\n People wear pins on jackets, bags, lanyards and other articles of clothing.  Some people prefer to display their collections in shadow boxes or on cork boards.\nI also like to put them on my dice bags!\n My wife and I recently had our third child.  During the month of January I spent many nights on 'night shift' with the new little one.  I had a sleeping newborn cradled in one arm and a sketchbook within reach of the other.  Magic was happening between 2 AM and 5 AM and it all started with a little sketch of a cat wizard...\n One thing led to another and over the course of several weeks I ended up designing 13 classes and a Game Master as black cats!  \nI would like to give a special shout out to Reddit's /DnD for persuading me to include the Artificer!\nBut maybe you had something different in mind?\n For those with more specific taste, at the Custom Kitty reward tier I will work with you to design a Custom Kitty and have it produced as hard enamel pins.  Once they have been produced you will receive twenty-five (25) pins of your choice from this campaign.  Get 25 of your Custom Kitty or swap some out for other pins from this project, it is all up to you!\nI, Joshua Pinkas, will retain all rights to the resulting design and will be able to sell and distribute additional pins or any other derivative work in perpetuity.\nThis kitty doesn't have to play by the 'rules'.  While it could be inspired by a DnD player class it doesn't have to be.  Maybe a tribal shaman is more up your alley, or perhaps a cyborg necromancer kitty!  If it generally can fit under the banner of the Fantasy genre it is fair game!  An Egyptian themed warrior dual-wielding kopesh sounds fun too!\nThe resulting design will be similar in size and style to the other designs in this campaign.\nNo nudity, lewdness, gore, or obviously offense concepts will be allowed.  I reserve the right to refund your pledge in full and cease work on the custom kitty if for some reason we are unable to come to an agreement on the final design.\nIf you pledge at this tier and want pins in addition to the 25 described above please add an additional $8 US per pin you would like.\n I designed these awesome pins, but it is expensive to have them all produced as pins. Think of Kickstarter as a place for you to pre-order these pins.  \nYou pledge money to this campaign, then when the campaign is over Kickstarter collects the money from you and gives it to me.  I then use that money to pay my production partner to make the pins.  Then when I receive them I inspect them for quality, package them up and ship them out to you!  \nIt can take a while for all of that to happen (especially for larger projects like I hope this one will be), but at the end of it we have brought something awesome into the world that didn't exist before, and I cannot do it without your support!  \nThank you for helping me in my creative journey!\nESTIMATED PROJECT TIMELINE\nMarch 26 to April 28 \u2013 Kickstarter Campaign!\nApril 28 to May 5 \u2013 Kickstarter collects pledges from backers.\nMay 5 to May 25 \u2013 Backers fill out surveys.  This is very important to make sure an appropriate number of pins are produced of each design!\nJune 1 \u2013 Finalize order with production partner.\nJune 1 to Mid-July - We all wait patiently...\nMid-July \u2013 Receive pins from production partner!\nMid-July to late-August \u2013 Cushion time!  What could possibly go wrong?  Well hopefully nothing, but this time is here if we need it.  If we don't need it shipping will get moved up!\nEarly September \u2013 Inspecting and packaging pins for shipping to backers.\nMid-September to late-September \u2013 Ship pins out to backers!\nBecause of the logistics involved with running a project such as this we have built in what we believe is a reasonable cushion time to handle any unforeseen complications.  If all goes well and we don't need the cushion time we will be shipping the pins out as early as we are able.\n My name is Joshua R. Pinkas and I am the creator and owner of Frost Dragon Designs, LLC. After years of working on projects for others through freelance work and private commissions, I decided to start building something for myself and started Frost Dragon Designs, LLC.  \nI am a seasoned pin creator and have designed, had manufactured, and delivered thousands of beautiful enamel pins.  Many of my previous designs are available for sale through my online shop, frostdragondesigns.com.\nAll of my designs are my own original creations. I start my creative process with traditional drawings in sketchbooks. Even the simplest of designs will usually go through a dozen or more revisions before I recreate it digitally and prepare the files to send to my manufacturers.\nI love launching new projects and designs on Kickstarter because this is where I got my start with my company, and because I have found a wonderfully supportive community here who genuinely care about creatives.\nEvery pin you back helps fund the production of new original designs!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI am a designer, not a manufacturer, so I have to trust my manufacturer to execute my designs at a high level and on time. There could be production issues that are beyond my control that could impact the delivery date. Also minor changes in the design may occur to prevent manufacturing problems, but these will only be made if it is absolutely necessary and every effort will be made to preserve the original aesthetic.\n\nAdditionally, though shipping logistics could always potentially be a problem, I have reliably shipped thousands of pins via USPS.\n\nIf any issues arise I will be sure to notify backers.\n\nPlease note that everyone's monitors display images a little differently.

Sign up for our newsletter and follow along as we develop the Quest Calendar.\n Role play everyday without a GM!\nThe 2021 Quest Calendar is a single-player role playing game that takes place on a page-a-day style calendar. Play it a couple minutes each day over the year and get your daily fix of dice-rolling fantasy fun.  The calendar features a story driven adventure that will be told day by day, with plenty of quests, loot items, characters, and combat.\nAs the story unfolds, how will your decisions over the year shape your character?\nNo need to memorize tons of rules. Pick your character and jump right in. The game is simple. Just follow 3 rules: Read, Roll, and Resolve.\nCombat\nCombat is done much the same way, but with more dice rolling.\nLevel Up\nAs the year goes on, your hero will get better in many ways.\nGet the 2021 Quest Calendar with a few extra items to make playing every day more fun.\n\nCustom Character Note:\nThe custom character will not be printed with the calendar. Nor will it be available in the laminated character book.You will have it available to download and print. You will get a page for each level your character will achieve (along with their stat increases and new abilities).\nIf you choose to allow, we can make this character available to download for others on the website.\nThe Custom Day WILL be printed with the calendar!\nIf you want extra of anything available (with the exception of the \"Custom Characters\" and  \"Design You Own Day\" due to limited quantity) please add an additional amount to your pledge per the following. \nWe will be using a pledge manager after the campaign ends. The pledge manager will allow you to add on extras like more dice sets. You will be able to use the extra credit in the pledge manager for this loot.\nAfter this project gets funded, there are a few things we can do to improve the fun. Some plans we are considering are new calendar features, more characters, different dice colors, a dice tower add on, and even minis.\n I've never liked any existing systems for fantasy months. There are good ones, but every time a player asks, \"What is the in-game date?\" and I've told them, I always get a look of confusion before I reply, \"A Saturday in late November.\" With this funding level, I will add a homebrew date system that translates to the Gregorian calendar (the one we use).  As you play daily, you will get familiar with it and be able to use it easily in your own tabletop RPGs.\n\nSo far we have a Thief, Druid, Sorceress, and Barbarian. Once we reach 30k, I will be able to create a new character for you to play: a Paladin. \nOnce we reach 35k, I will be able to create a new character for you to play: the Bard. Yes, his image is modeled after the creator of the Quest Calendar himself.\n\nAt 40k, I will upgrade the dice from a solid color (though still pretty) to an appealing swirl of colors. The dice colors are still in the works, but instead of a solid color, they will a nice galaxy swirl pattern similar to the one in the promo shot. The dice included will still be mini dice, though!\nA small draw string dice bag to hold your mini dice when you aren't adventuring, or to take them with you!  It will be unlocked at 55k and like the mini dice, it will come free with every 2021 quest calendar.\nOur 22k funding goal will allow us to pay for the extensive amount of artwork for this calendar as well as get it into production. It requires 300+ full color illustrations. Without your backing, this calendar won't happen.\nIf this project is successful, we will be back here with a new story, new heroes, and more adventure in another Quest Calendar. Look forward to other themes such as horror, space fantasy, pirates, western, samurai, zombie apocalypse, etc. We will send out polls to get your input on what you want to see next. If there is interest in reprinting this year's story, we may do so.\nThere is a lot of content in this calendar, which makes it heavy. It is practically a book but doesn't count as media mail. Consequently, shipping gets to be expensive, more so for international shipping. We have included estimated shipping rates for different regions in the chart below.\nIn order to provide you with the best possible value, shipping will be charged through our pledge manager after the campaign ends. The pledge manager will also allow you to confirm your shipping address, add on extras like more dice sets, upgrade your backer reward, and finalize your order.\n\nThese are our current estimates for shipping. We aren't too happy with this either and we will continue to look for better options for our customers after the campaign. The actual costs could change based on varying circumstances. A large success here may allow us to partner with a fulfillment center that can reduce the customer cost.\nLocal Pickup\nIf you are local to the Denver, Colorado Springs, or Pueblo area, we will host a local pickup event so you can pick up your copy for free. For those willing to drive to Colorado Springs, we will set up a time and a location at a local game shop so you can come get your Quest Calendar packages, meet the creator, and get your copy signed. You will be able to select this option in the pledge manager after the campaign ends.\nIf you are still reading, I want to thank you. This game calendar means a lot to me. It is pretty scary to make something and and put yourself out there for the first time. I began this project because I believe I have a great product that will fill your need for fun every day and I am passionate and dedicated to bringing it to you.\n\nRetailers\nAre you a Friendly Local Game Store interested in backing 2021 Quest Calendar for your customers?  Sundial Games believes in supporting brick-and-mortar stores, so we are offering discounts on bulk orders to allow your store to purchase the standard version of 2021 Quest Calendar (with No Dice).

Even now, the Coronavirus is delaying manufacture of many other Kickstarter items made in China. We anticipate this will blow over by the time we move to production.\n\nWe have been working hard to conduct research, seek advice, and follow in the example of many great Kickstarters before ours. This is our first Kickstarter, but we have laid the groundwork with our manufacturing and logistic partners to walk through the process of getting the product from production to your door. \n\nIn our research, we discovered that there are many potential deadline issues others have with manufacturing in China. Luckily for this project, there are very few components to worry about so there are less manufacturing risks.\n\nThe calendar is not in its completed state. Though the mechanics and story are mostly done, there is a substantial number of art assets, some writing, and play testing to complete. This is why we are on Kickstarter. While I have no doubt that we will complete this in time to get the calendar to production, we have built contingencies into the plan so that you will still get a full year of play.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Digital High Five", "descp": "Your dollar gets you all of our up to date info, announcements, input on stretch goals, and a thank you.\nRetailers: Choose this reward and contact us for bulk orders.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2020"}], "stat": ["7 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "2021 Quest Calendar - Print & Play", "descp": "A high-quality PDF version for you to print and play.\nINCLUDES:\n2021 Quest Calendar - Print and Play", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2020"}], "stat": ["297 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 22 or more", "title": "2021 Quest Calendar & Dice", "descp": "ONE copy of 2021 Quest Calendar plus a set of the Kickstarter Exclusive dice to play.\nShipping will be collected after the campaign ends (see \"shipping\" section for details).\nINCLUDES:\n2021 Quest Calendar\nKickstarter Exclusive Dice\n2021 Quest Calendar - Print and Play\nAll Applicable Unlocked Stretch Goals", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["665 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 42 or more", "title": "Gift Set", "descp": "TWO copies of 2021 Quest Calendar plus 2 sets of the Kickstarter Exclusive dice to play.

Let's add more content to Swords 'n Magic and Stuff with our stretch goals!\n\nWe reached all of our stretch goals for the campaign and we couldn't be more excited! Thank you to everyone who contributed and helped us make this a reality. \nWe obviously can't promise that Swords 'n Magic will be accepted by Nintendo but now we can afford to focus on porting in case we are. We promise to do everything within our power to get the game there and keep you in the loop every step of the way.\nWe love this community and couldn't imagine developing a game without all of you right behind us.\nSwords 'n Magic and Stuff is a cute, cooperative, open world video game centered around the joy of discovery. This game is a passion project that I've been bringing to life for over two years now. Swords 'n Magic and Stuff is a love letter to all the game worlds I lost myself in growing up.  The game is being developed with my wife and daughter in mind. We'd searched for years for a game like Swords 'n Magic and finally I just decided that I'd have to take matters into my own hands.\nThe game is a casual journey of discovery. You take the role of a blank slate adventurer just waiting for their chance to carve out their destiny. With no classes, levels or restrictions, you can be whoever you want to be, use whatever weapons and items you can buy, loot or craft, and play however you wish. You can seek out epic adventures laden with legendary treasure or enjoy the simple life of owning a small farm, crafting furniture for your home or even just traveling the world as a simple merchant. In Swords 'n Magic and Stuff you play at your own pace with no hand-holding.\nTirawyn is a high fantasy world where a good king has befallen a terrible curse and fled his throne in an attempt to save his kingdom from himself. The people of Tirawyn are in a state of panic as evil begins to lurk in all corners of the realm and novice adventurers begin to take matters into their own hands. But are they causing more trouble than they're worth? \nWatch the lore episode from the Swords 'n Magic devlog below to learn more about the history of Tirawyn and how the world came to be. \nSwords 'n Magic and Stuff has been designed and developed live on Twitch.tv from the ground up with an audience of passionate fantasy RPG fans. This game is a tribute to this wonderful community who has supported it from its humble beginnings and because of that, fan input has always been a high priority for me. So much so that some of the in-game clothing designs and lore books were actually created by the Swords 'n Magic community through a content submission system for our most creative fans. We plan to continue this effort, and in doing so, keep as connected as possible with fans, treating your ideas and opinions with the respect and consideration they deserve.\nJoin our Discord to see frequent updates about the game, share your ideas for the game and to chat with like-minded adventurers!\nSwords 'n Magic and Stuff stands out because of all the individual pieces that fit together to create a dynamic, immersive world for you to lose yourself in. While we understand the excitement of exploring dangerous lands and fighting powerful monsters, as long-time Dungeons and Dragons players, we also understand that the downtime in an adventure should be just as engaging. Which is why a lot of our features revolve around town-life and the act of owning and decorating your own home among many other non-combat gameplay features.\nOur core design pillars are exploration, discovery, curiosity and growth. We use these to drive our core gameplay loop which is designed to be as follows: Players explore a new area, discover something interesting, seek out more about that new interest driven by curiosity and not a quest log with tick boxes, then return to their home to rest and evaluate the items they've discovered in order to progress and grow as a character and a player. Of course, we also believe that getting lost in loops within loops is a very intriguing part of open world game design, which is why we've not only designed specific zones to fit into this loop, but also sections of each zone and even the items within those sections. Everything is driven by discovery and curiosity, which is why it's so important for us to create hand crafted content that's unique and engaging for players of all ages and skill levels.\nHere's a breakdown of some of the most noteworthy features in Swords 'n Magic and Stuff to get an idea of all there is for players to experience:\nPlay with your friends in networked multiplayer\nCollect and discover hundreds of items\nUse anything - No class or level restrictions\nHands-off quests - No breadcrumbs or quest markers\nDual wield anything\nBuy, tame and collect dozens of mounts and pets\nSeasons and weather effects\nSeasonal events and unique seasonal items\nMini-games like tavern dice and target practice\nJoin factions and rise through the ranks\nTitles that show off your accomplishments\nBuild or purchase homes and furniture to decorate them with\nFish, hunt, grow and harvest resources to cook hearty meals with\nGather materials and craft your own furniture and weapons\nExplore a wide variety of dungeons\nPvP Arenas to test your mettle with your friends\nCollect clothes, hats and armor to customize your character\nNon-gendered character creation\nTwitch integration to get your viewers into the action\nA private, dedicated server you can host yourself\nFully mappable keybinds and gamepad support\nWe don't believe in hand-holding or tick boxes when it comes to questing. We're approaching each quest as a separate adventure driven entirely by curiosity. Instead of accepting a quest from an NPC, you'll have the opportunity to add intriguing information to your journal to keep track of information for later. Finding a book about an ancient sword forgotten by history isn't just lore, but a treasure map in its own right. Asking around could lead you on a new epic journey to find that long lost weapon and learn about why it's important along the way, if that's your thing.\nMany games offer multiplayer, but not many offer what Swords 'n Magic plans to. I want to give players the best and most connected experience possible. Playing together means also being able to play apart. You aren't tethered to your friends when playing. Explore the world at your own pace and party up when you feel like it. And when you're ready to join another friend, take your entire character and everything they're holding with you. No need to make a new character for every new server.\n\nHost a game directly through Steam for up to 8 players or host a dedicated server wherever you like so you and all your friends can come and go as you please. Password protect your worlds or invite anyone and make new friends.  Customize your hosted world with options that cater to how you want to experience the world.\n\nSwords 'n Magic is designed to sidestep a drawback my wife and I have experienced many times with multiplayer RPG's. We hate having to start new worlds or new characters when we invite a new friend to play with us. In this game we're doing our best to make sure that not only can a new friend join at any time, but with no level restrictions, they can join in on the fun right off the bat. You can simply share some of your higher tier gear with them, or if they'd prefer to work for it themselves, you can trade your gear out at your house for some of your weaker items and join in on their adventure as an equal. \n\n\nBacking the game gets you access to exclusive Kickstarter rewards. All tiers which include game keys also include access to these rewards. When the game launches we'll also be offering a Hero Edition, which includes even more exclusive in-game content. Because we believe that pay to win mechanics are a dark cloud over the game industry, none of our exclusive in-game rewards offer any actual gameplay advantages and are merely cosmetic. \nWant to back with PayPal? No problem! Head over here to do so:\n\n\nBonus reward!\nGuess what! Because of how much more this campaign has brought in than we expected, we decided to add a new reward for everyone to show our appreciation. Every tier that receives a game key will also get a super cute, in-game, baby fox pet. Here's some awesome concept art drawn by our artist, Kitsunne.\n\n\nKindred Games was founded in early 2018 by me, Michael Kocha. I started Swords 'n Magic and Stuff as a solo project under no studio name thinking it would be a quick 3 month game project I used to learn Unreal Engine. But when I started streaming the game and began growing a small, but very dedicated fanbase, features and ideas started piling up and the game became a bigger project, eventually growing into my dream project.  \n This is when I began Kindred Games. I knew from the start that the studio needed to represent the passion I felt for making games with an audience and my family in mind. Kindred, which means one's family, was such a perfect word for how I wanted to treat this project and ultimately my game studio.\nSix months into development I'd built a nice little prototype of what I thought the game could feel like. I released it to many of my most dedicated fans and received loads of feedback and praise. Though I thought the game only had a couple hours of content, some of my testers racked up over a dozen hours in the project looking for every single secret and trying to find every item in the game. That's when I knew what the core focus of the game needed to be. The joy of discovery.\nI got to work learning more about Unreal Engine and taking the project more seriously. I knew the prototype was a success and that the game was going to be something worth investing my time into. I brought on a programmer (Not Moz!) to add multiplayer to the game at this time as well.\nBut it's hard to make a video game while living in a hotel room for 2 months.\nShortly after we started implementing multiplayer my wife, Janna, was relocated to a state halfway across the country and I had to take 3 months off from the game. Partly because of packing and selling our house, and partly because we were stuck in a hotel room for two months before we could find somewhere to live near Janna's work. This was a huge setback for me and the programmer. When I finally returned to the game I'd lost all motivation and ambition. After nearly 6 months of working with the programmer we still couldn't even play the game together. Nothing was working right and all I'd done in 6 months was build half of a new zone and a single dungeon. \nSo I quit.\nI threw in the towel and let the programmer go. This was the lowest point in the development of Swords 'n Magic and probably in all of my game dev career. I had failed to keep the game and my passion for it alive and it really hurt watching my community slowly disappear. My streams had stopped entirely. My testers hadn't received an update in months. Everyone knew that Swords 'n Magic was now dead. Lost in the indie game graveyard with hundreds of thousands of other unfinished games that had real potential.\nI took a few weeks off to reevaluate my goals as a gamedev. Eventually my 3 year old daughter asked me one day to play the game again and asked why I hadn't been working. I loaded it up for her and she sat on my lap and took the gamepad.  I watched her explore the world for the thousandth time as she asked me questions about who the different NPC's were, what they were saying, why they were where they were and if she could be friends with them. She asked me questions about where she could find a better sword and how to get gold so she could buy another potion to drink. She ran away from the monsters and tried hugging all the sheep. Finally she asked if I would make a new character for her to meet. Within the hour I found myself adding more content into the game for her to play through and I knew Swords 'n Magic and Stuff just couldn't be over. Not yet.\n\n\nOne year later\nThe game has changed a lot. Many of the original mechanics have been reworked and now the game features fully functioning multiplayer. I've hired a different programmer on to help with this. I've also embraced the fact that I can't make this game alone this time around. If I'm going to build a game for a growing, loving community then I would need their help in more ways than one.\n\n\nSwords 'n Magic and Stuff is being developed by a team of two developers: Me, (Michael, aka Kindred) and Moz. But we're not the only ones contributing to the game's success. Since I've been streaming the development of the game for over two years I've also grown a small but very dedicated and hard working mod team. Many of these wonderful people have proven to have other very useful talents in places outside moderation so they deserve a mention here as well.\n\nSpecial thanks:\n Gideon - Youtube Video Editor\n Cameron - Website Developer\n Janna - Community Manager\n Brendan - Illustrator\n Wendy - Social Media Management\nEven though these awesome people don't do any work on the game itself, they are still a huge help. Without them I don't think anything would get done around here.\nI've been a stay at home dad for just over 5 years. Since quitting my job in retail I went to school for 3D art and animation for games and earned my bachelor's degree. My goal was always to make games, but I didn't think making my own games for a living would ever be a real possibility. Luckily the opportunity presented itself when we learned that child care cost more than what I made at my job. My wife's career, however, was just beginning to take off and she went on to support the family while I followed my dream of being a dev dad.  \nJust over a month ago my wife, Janna, was informed that the position she currently held was being eliminated. This put her in an awkward spot where she had to choose between applying for positions across the country that she didn't want, or to leave the company she had invested her life into for 12 years.\nAfter a few weeks of serious contemplation she decided that it was time to put all of our cards on the table with Swords 'n Magic and Stuff. \nNow that she's helping full time with Swords 'n Magic we have no other income until the game launches. Kickstarter is a chance for us to fund the development of the game without having to go bankrupt in the meantime.\nWith your help we'll be able to see the rest of the development through without worrying about how to put food on our tables, but we'll also be able to give the game the love and attention it deserves. We've budgeted a chunk of the funds for a custom soundtrack and already have a musician ready to go. We're putting some funds toward marketing to make sure that the game has as many eyes on it as we can get. Some of the funding will go into custom animations and sound effects for the game as well as any additional tools and software costs we run into along the way. And finally, we plan on paying our wonderful programmer, Moz, a cut for all the hard work he's already put in with nothing in return. It's not every day you find a skilled programmer who has enough love for a project to work for a revenue share. We're very lucky to have him so you can play Swords 'n Magic and Stuff with your friends and family. As it was meant to be played.\nBut in the event that the Kickstarter fails, we still plan to continue the project. We hope you understand that this means we'll have to cut back heavily on the game's features and content. We'll have to cancel the musician, deal with limited animation and sound effect assets, we'll have to find a way to market the game on no budget and worst of all, rush the project to completion. This means the game won't be what we envision, but I couldn't move on from it without knowing that we did everything we could to make it succeed.\nI truly believe wholeheartedly in this game. I hope that you'll consider supporting us in this project so we can bring  my passion project to life. I can't wait to see you in the game. Thanks for reading. <3", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nBased on all the Kickstarter horror stories of games being abandoned after a successful campaign, I think it's obvious that the biggest risk is this game not being completed. \n\nI've been working on this project for over two years and have restarted the project twice for different reasons. I've since brought on a programmer and have grown a fantastic community through Twitch and Youtube. I think having this many people counting on me, requesting regular updates and cheering me on has kept me on track far longer than I could have done on my own and I have no doubt it will continue to motivate me to finish. \n\nIn the end we think being open and honest is always the best course of action, especially when asking for a community to fund a large project like this. Without your help, this project can't happen, so it's only fair to keep you in the loop when we run into problems or setbacks. \n\nWe promise never to leave you in the dark about the status of the project or issues we encounter.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 2 or more", "title": "Every little bit helps", "descp": "We get it.

With the materials, codes, and clues hidden inside, you must use your ingenuity and match the objects to solve the case.\nWith this model, we want to expand the possibilities of traditional Escape Rooms. By not being dependent on a physical space we have greater freedom to: create complex, different and surprising puzzles, a more sophisticated story and we can make the game reach all over the world.\nKey Enigma: Hack Forward is an experience as much as a game. Face the challenge by yourself or with a trustworthy group.\n The box is the heart of the project where you will find the material that serves as a bridge to connect the physical and digital world to live an immersive experience.\nHere you\u2019ll find some examples of the puzzles and materials you will find in the box to solve the challenges that the adventure requires:\nTraditional puzzles\nSimilar to those found in the traditional Escape Rooms: Logic puzzles, reveal messages, interact with objects, use pencil and paper\u2026 \n Immersive / Digital puzzles \nPuzzles that will make you doubt the limits between reality and fiction; exploring websites, news, videos or spying on security cameras. Even in some cases, you will have to use everyday tools such as your email, social networks, chats or mobile phone\u2026  \n Codes \nFind keys to decrypt secret ciphers, Morse codes, strange runes, braille, binary code or use the everyday objects like the periodic table or a chessboard to unravel a secret message.\nAdvanced Puzzles\nIf we manage to reach certain objectives we can add more complex puzzles which could include magnets, embarking on missions in the real world, receiving phone calls, among other amazing surprises. \nSome of the puzzles shown above are examples. We don't want to show you the final puzzles of Hack Forward to not spoil your experience. \nTo make progress on the story, you must investigate and solve a series of puzzles. The enigmatic objects in the box will help you solve the mysteries online and vice versa. Therefore it will be necessary to have a device with a good internet connection and the box.\nThe game can be played solo or with a group of friends, is recommended for people over 14 years old and is available in English, Spanish, German, French, and Portuguese. \nIt is not necessary to be an expert at any particular subject, you just need to accept the challenge and get involved and understand that your decisions can alter the course of the story.\nThe game is primarily a one-time use game like the real Escape Rooms but it can be resettable, to add replay-ability, so you can see the different ramifications of the story or just lend it to someone else to experience.\nThe digital puzzles can be reset with a button on our website. The physical objects in the box won\u2019t suffer damage playing, but some papers will suffer damage, so at the end of each chapter, you will find the PDF files so you can print them again at home.\nMore than 8 hours of investigation and fun, divided into 8 chapters. Like traditional Escape Rooms, the clock is ticking and your time will be registered at the end of each chapter, although this is optional. For those up to the competition, this is the ultimate ranking. Time will not run between chapters, so you can take a break and continue later. \nIf you get stuck, do not worry, you can interact with the characters in the story and ask for advice. They will give you clues and hints to help you move forward.\nIf you want to get a taste of the immersion of the game here you have the chance for free. The DEMO can be completed totally online without the box but it\u2019s nothing compared to the whole experience with the box. \nhttps://keyenigma.com/hackforward/chapterone\nMore than 4000 people have already played the first chapter and only 30% of participants have successfully completed it on time. The average time is 1 hour. Can you beat that record? \nIn our first adventure, titled Hack Forward, there has been a worldwide cyberattack. Massive data filtration has affected from Nuclear power plants to ordinary citizens. Anyone with a smart device can be a target.\nYou will put yourself in the shoes of an investigator whose predecessor has disappeared under strange circumstances. You must continue with the investigation and find those responsible for the massive leaks that threaten the security of the world. \nBut soon you\u2019ll discover that those leaks are a smokescreen for something much more dangerous. Who is behind all this? What could be so important? We can\u2019t tell you any more without spoilers, but if you like conspiracy theories, science fiction and plot twists you will love this one.\nDive into this immersive experience that will make you question a real problem. Our personal data is on the Internet and any camera device may be recording you at this time. The idea of this story is based on how vulnerable we are to it. Is technology getting too powerful that it will overrule us?\nThe story will be divided into 8 chapters. Each one has its own objective and different challenges that can be completed in 1 hour, like a traditional Escape Room. You can play them all in a row or you can take a break and play another day. \nBy not depending on spatial and temporal limitations like other Escape Rooms, we are able to have greater freedom to improve.  \n\nShipping is charged as part of this Kickstarter campaign. You just have to select your reward and then your Country (or \"Rest of the world\") and the shipping price is automatically added to the pledge.\nYour shipping address will be collected after the Kickstarter ends and we close to the delivery date.\nIf you want to get two copies of the game go to FAQ section for details.\nThe European Union, USA and Canada will be \u201cShipping Friendly\u201d. Backers from these countries will not pay import taxes. We will be using fulfillment center partners to ship locally for each country.\nOutside of the EU, USA and Canada we cannot guarantee customs friendly shipping in these areas. There may be additional duties and/or fees charged by your country's governmental agencies and/or shipping partners that will be your responsibility.\n For Retail shops buying packs of 6 or more boxes send us an email at contact@keyenigma.com\nWe are a startup that aims to launch different Escape Games themes (Terror, Adventure, Detective,...) that resemble the Escape Room experience but right in your home.\nOr even explore the possibilities of launching a subscription box with bi-monthly shippings.\nBut this project can only be carried if we get enough support through Kickstarter.\n Why do we do it? \nAs big fans of Escape Rooms and Escape Games sometimes we encountered limitations for playing as often as we wished. Such restrictions encouraged us to embark on this project:\n Location: Most of the time we are limited to playing in our city or surroundings, and assembling a group of friends to go to a faraway Escape Room seems impossible.  Key Enigma box is at the best location: your home.\n Variety & Innovation: Once you have played many traditional Escape Rooms they all start feeling the same. Our game is a breath of fresh air that will surprise you.\n Cost: Escape Rooms are expensive! Our game is a fraction of the price.\n Main Inspirations \nThe night of October 30th, 1938 gave us the most famous radio broadcast in history: \"War of the Worlds\" by Orson Welles.\nOrson Welles certainly understood all the possibilities radio could offer and knew how to use it to carry out a very different entertainment experience from what people were used to. What we want to do now is to present a similar experience using the multiple communication options we have available nowadays.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIf you're new to Kickstarter: you can support our game by selecting one of the rewards we have prepared for you. If we reach our funding goal of \u20ac28500, you will enable us to develop the game from start to finish in every detail according to our vision.\n\nThe amount of money you spend will only be collected if we reach our goal you will receive your rewards once the game is released. However, if we fail to reach our goal, your contribution won't be charged at all.\n\nThis is not our first rodeo, Albert Benitez former co-founder and CEO of Stream Hatchet, knows how to handle deadlines, and has a very specific plan of attack for this new project. And the amazing team that surrounds him has experience writing novels and scripts from start to finish and they also build Escape Rooms in their city. The team has the skills necessary to complete the vision of the company.\n\nWe have already finished the writing of Hack Forward game and we are only missing a few puzzles that need some specific elaborations regarding quality and technology.\n\nOur biggest challenges to complete the game are:\n\n- Manufacturing and design: we want to make this game available at an affordable price. We have to talk with lots of providers and get a fair price because we want to include quality components, physical objects, and elaborate puzzles.\n- Technology: we must form a credible digital universe in addition to testing and programming web pages, chats, email responses,\u2026 These components are being developed in house to bring the prices down due to the experience we have elaborating on similar technological projects. \n- Narrative: We want to naturally blend narrative, puzzles and technology to form a credible and immersive story given the tight budget.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u20ac45 or more", "title": "The Box", "descp": "EN: You will get our Box (35% discount off retail price)\n---\nESP: Recibir\u00e1s nuestra Caja (35% de descuento respecto al precio de venta)\nINCLUDES:\nKey Enigma: Hack Forward", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["750 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac60 or more", "title": "Collaboration Box", "descp": "EN: You will get our Box and the last three releases of Cryptogram Puzzles Post series (Created by Jack Fallows).

It is up to you, to prove your worth.\nYou'll each choose one of the four Irregulars (it is ok if you have fewer players and only choose some, or even one!).\nWiggins has begun to master the art of deduction under Holmes's tutelage.\nMyrtle is a master of disguise and can help the Irregulars slip past all but the most observant.\nIke is particularly good at throwing a beatdown on foes of the Irregulars, or providing some muscle.\nVicky is an expert at climbing and acrobatics, allowing her to spot things for the group.\nNow you are ready to play! Select a Mission from the mission book and set out across London to solve the mystery.\nPlayers will need to be on the lookout for how their special skill can help the group.\nClick to see a larger version!\nAfter you've completed a mission decide to move on to the next or save your place and continue later.\nFor the first time, you can see where it all began. The entire line of Sherlock GNAs take place after the famed dive off of Reichenbach Falls, where Sherlock and Moriarty allegedly plunged to their deaths. Now you can see what happened after those incredible events, and how Sherlock got back in the investigatory saddle, through the eyes of his trusted friend, Dr. Watson.\nSherlock trusts you to prove your deductive prowess and solve cases that have left Inspector Lestrade, and Scotland Yard, puzzled to say the least. Be careful though, not only are your investigations perilous, but Sherlock himself has little tolerance for failure. However you choose to go about solving the mysteries, as always, it's your story, your choices, and your adventure.\nWe want to make this as simple as possible, so there are just three options for pledging.\nWe know it's holiday season, and many of us are running around looking for the perfect gift still. If this looks like a great gift for someone in your life but you're worried about having something under the tree, fear not. We have this handy holiday certificate for you, so you can have something to give one of those special people in your life while they wait to crack the case on Baker Street.\nClick on the image for a Hi-Res download.\nThe game has multiple missions to experience.  You can get a lot of play from each of the missions and you will also want to experience them both alone, and with your friends, as the experience differs somewhat in each format. It all adds up to many hours of enjoyment for you, your family, your friends, and your game group!\nShipping will be charged separately in our post-campaign pledge manager at a later date. Above are our estimated shipping rates for each region. For those outside the USA, we highly encourage bundling both products as shipping is only a few dollars more. We provide friendly shipping to USA, Canada, Australia, the European Union, and select countries in Asia.\nEU Includes: United Kingdom, Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden\nRest of Asia Includes: Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, Vietnam\n Sherlock Holmes: Baker Street Irregulars is a fully developed Graphic Novel Adventures cooperative game contained within four books and is our English translation of the game recently released in France from publishers Makaka Editions and Blue Orange Europe. We will not be offering stretch goals for this campaign. \nInstead of stretch goals, throughout the campaign, we will be revealing additional info about the game and a few special surprises!\nThe books for Baker Street Irregulars are softcover with good quality and Sherlock: The Beginning is a hardcover book.  The map for Baker Street Irregulars is printed on card stock and the cardboard box has a magnetized enclosure and is of good quality with color printing inside and out. We've learned that sometimes quality issues may arise unexpectedly, but as with all of our products, we stand behind the quality and if there are any issues we will happily take care of you and replace any defective items.\nOur retailer offer for this project is only available to retailers in the USA and Canada. \nVan Ryder Games offers Retailers the ability to get our products through our VRG Select Retailer program and you can pre-order the products from this Kickstarter. A VRG Select Retailer is a retailer that has the ability to order games directly from us through our Retailer-only webstore. In fact, you don\u2019t even need to back this project (though we highly recommend it to stay up to speed with the progress!)\n1. Go to https://vanrydergames.com/retailers\n2. Fill out the form application\n3. Wait to be verified (usually within 48 business hours)\n4. Once approved, you will be sent instructions for accessing our Retailer Shop Portal, as well as, pricing and other details regarding this project.\nWe will work hard to support YOU, the retailers who support US and our products!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nVan Ryder Games has successfully funded and fulfilled many projects. We learn more and more with each experience. Our goal is to get the game to you, our supporters, as quickly as possible, but we won't sacrifice quality for speed.\n\nThere are the usual risks of printing, shipping, customs, and other unintended delays, but you can be sure we will deliver the game to you as promised. Feel free to ask any of our returning backers!\n\nA few remarks we want to share with you regarding our approach for our projects, including this one.\n1. Communication is of the utmost importance to us. Please ask any and all questions and we will answer as quickly as possible.\n2. Our stretch goal items are determined by us before the campaign begins, in the event all of them are achieved we will not add more as it puts our project timeline and cost at risk.\n3. Your comments and feedback are REALLY important to us. If you have an idea, concern, or compliment, please share it with us! We can't promise to implement or act on every idea that comes our way, but we will certainly consider and listen to each one!\n4. We pledge to keep a positive attitude regardless of the success or failure of this project and we ask that you do the same.\n5. To have fun! Kickstarter projects can be stressful, but these are games and the most important thing is to have FUN!\n\nPlease note the following is our policy on pledges and refunds.\n\nRefund Policy\n\nAll pledges are final upon the completion of the funding period, however we may, at our sole discretion, refund your pledge in full if the request is made within two weeks of the end of the campaign. Any request for refund after more than two weeks has passed, if accepted by us, will be subject to a 10-20% cancellation fee to account for KS fees and administrative expenses. Please note that, anyone that does not complete the pledge manager by our required deadlines will not be eligible for a refund for any reason, including the assessment of additional shipping fees for expenses related to the delinquency of the backer completing their survey information.\n\nAbandoned Pledges\n\nWe require that our pledge manager and/or survey be completed in a timely manner so that we can process orders efficiently and on time. Completing your survey late at any point beyond the deadline we communicate AND/OR failure to pay shipping in a timely manner when the surveys are reopened, could result in significant delays in receiving your rewards, additional shipping expense, duties, taxes, or other fees to be paid by you, and you will not be eligible for a refund for any reason. We give plenty of time to complete the survey, so please do so in a timely manner to avoid any inconvenience or delay. Any survey that is not completed within 30 days from final fulfillment (defined as the last date of shipping of KS rewards for your region) will result in your pledge being considered abandoned and any amount pledged will be considered a gift in support of the project.\n\nBy pledging to this project you understand the risks, challenges, and pledge terms we have laid out here, and agree to be bound by them. If you do not agree to these terms, please do not pledge for this project and wait for the possibility of the game to become available direct or in the retail market.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 19 or more", "title": "Prospect", "descp": "One (1) copy of Sherlock Holmes: The Beginning\nINCLUDES:\nSherlock Holmes: The Beginning", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["47 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 30 or more", "title": "Baker Street Irregular", "descp": "One (1) copy of Sherlock Holmes: Baker Street Irregulars\nINCLUDES:\nSherlock Holmes: Baker Street Irregulars", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["153 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 45 or more", "title": "Sherlock", "descp": "One (1) copy of Sherlock Holmes: Baker Street Irregulars AND one (1) copy of Sherlock Holmes: The Beginning\nINCLUDES:\nSherlock Holmes: Baker Street Irregulars\nSherlock Holmes: The Beginning", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["1,309 backers"]}], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #11", "update_userinfo": "Nearing final completion", "update_content": "Shipping updates for all regions\nHey everyone, we are nearing the completion of this project as fulfillment is wrapping up. \nUSA, Canada, Rest of World, Europe, and Australia with the exception of a very select few of you in countries impacted by COVID shipping restrictions, shipping has all been completed.

While time is not a game constraint, there is a new hint system and a player forum provided to guide players through the game.\nAlthough it is the second book of Trip 1907 Trilogy players do not need to have played or solved Trip 1907 to play it.\n\n\n \"During 1890 Norton Mine was permanently closed down due to the constant disappearances of miners. \nOn September of 1907  a Russian Mining company has assumed command of  the mine with a project goal of reaching Level 6, known as the Golden Level. Since the very first days of the project, a series of strange incidents occurred followed by a massive landslide leaving a small group of miners trapped inside its dark corridors. \nAfter 44 days of mysterious sounds and earthquakes, a rescue team has reached the 6th level finding only a black book that was assumed to be the diary of one of the missing miners.\nThe rescue team along with the black diary they retrieved, disappeared soon after they reached the surface. \nSince then, it is said that the miner's black diary appears every now and then on the doorstep of people around the world\". \nIn order to play Trip 1907: Forbidden Mine you will need:\nA copy of Trip 1907: Forbidden Mine.\nA pencil.\nAn internet connected device.\nA pair of scissors.\nStep 1.\nSolve the puzzle on the puzzle page indicated on the book.\nStep 2.\nSubmit your answer on Trip1907.com\nStep 3.\nWrite down the pass code provided to save your progress.\nPlayers need to research, write, draw, cut and fold book pages in order to progress through the game.\nBook Artwork\nSolve the puzzle and submit your answer at: trip1907.com/demo www.trip1907.com/demo \nPuzzle: You need the train number from the left page.\nHint: hELLhOLLE ---> read upside-down.\nThe basic idea behind Trip 1907: Forbidden Mine is to design a puzzle game in such a way as to feel and live an actual escape game adventure, unlocking chests, padlocks, locked doors and combining story points and even story objects.\nGiven the previous book game designing experience, changes have been made, from gameplay rules to book design. So in this version of Trip 1907: Forbidden Mine you will find:\nA new, faster, website has been added with no registration required.\nArt \"Seals\" have been added to pages, in order to distinguish a riddle page from an art and story page.\nThe \"sanity\" token hint exchange system is now on the hard copy. It is up to the players to keep track of their sanity tokens spent, leaving more space to continue the book even if all sanity points are spent.\n Pass codes have been added in order to save the game progress and give a linearity on the game puzzles.\nTrip 1907: Forbidden Mine is almost finished. The game design started nine months ago and the funds from this campaign will support all the expenses for the creation of this game. In this way delivery is a primary issue to us and will be done through Amazon & KDP separately for every backer of this project. Main goal is to complete all the delivery process on December 2019. This also depends on the volume of campaign orders. \nThere is an average delivery cost of 6 euros for worldwide shipping.\n\nBook Artwork\n Is TRIP 1907: Forbidden Mine an ebook?\nNope, Trip 1907 is  a hard copy book.\nDo I need an app to play it?\nNope, all you need is the copy of the book a pen and an internet connection.\nIs there a hint system for the riddles?\nA hint system is provided on trip1907.com, where players can exchange their sanity tokens for hints.\nIs there any additional charges for playing the book?\nNope, once you have purchased your copy there are no additional perks to buy.\nDo I need to have the first book in order to play it or to understand the story?\nTrip 1907: Forbidden Mine is a stand alone game and does not need to own the previous book.\nWhat is the language of the game?\nEnglish.\nIs there a forum to keep up with the riddles?\nA forum will be provided for players exchanging ideas over the riddles.\nWhat are the similarities or the differences with Trip 1907 ?\nGiven the previous experience, the new game book can be described as more fun and clear. Trip 1907 second edition will soon be available and will adapt some of the gameplay characteristics from Trip 1907: Forbidden Mine. So in this game you will find:\nA faster website with no registration needed.\nThe \"sanity token\" hint exchange system is now on the hard copy.

Monsters are lurking around every corner. You will need to enlist mighty heroes to empower your ranks and defeat the monsters.\nLast but not least, you will need to find rare dragon eggs, hatch them, and train your dragons to become formidable companions.\nWith the help of an army of heroes, you will save the faeries and use their magic to explore the world and build a mighty empire!\nSpring is upon us! As the flowers blossom, empires will rise!\nDwar7s Spring is language independent. The game's cards have no text. As such, with just the rulebook you will be able to play the game in all supported languages.\nInside the game's box, the rulebook will be in English. However, through our website (http://www.vesuviusmedia.com) or the Hive Portal (http://www.hiveinteractive.net) you will be able to download the rulebook for the core game and its expansions in several supported languages (eg. English, Portuguese, French, German, Greek, Spanish, Italian, and more).\nWith your support we have unlocked both the Alchemist and the Dragon classes! These miniatures are added to the Enchanted Forest and the Elven Uprising expansions!\n\nLearn how to play by watching the following video:\nClick on the image to go to Tabletopia and give the game a try!\nClick the image to download the rulebook\n Kickstarter Previews\nOne Dream, Four Seasons!\nOur vision for the world of Dwar7s is to create 4 different stand-alone games, one for each of the four seasons. The games will not require each other to be played, but story develops through the seasons. \nWe started our story with Dwar7s Fall (2016), which is a worker-placement, hand management game with take-that. In Dwar7s Fall you are a dwarf, trying to build your kingdom, while at the same time gathering provisions because the winter is coming!\nIn Dwar7s Winter (2018), a semi co-op, hand-building, miniature game, you are faced with a harsh winter and need to work with your fellow dwarfs to survive. You have to gather your allies and defend your castle from raging monsters that are trying to overtake it. At the same time, you need to repair damage done to your city by various disasters (blizzards, hurricanes, snow storms, volcanoes and more). Although you are working together to survive the 7 weeks of winter, at the end of the game (if you manage to survive!), the player with the most victory points is declared the winner.\nAfter Dwar7s Spring (2019), our plans include Dwar7s Summer, to be released next year. As soon as we finish all 4 seasons, we will release Dwar7s World! Dwar7s World will be a campaign where you play through all 4 seasons. Starting in the fall as a young Dwarf Worker, you will gather experience points as you play through the seasons and strive to become a great Dwarven King/Queen by the end of summer!\nFor information on Retail Pledge Levels: https://www.vesuviusmedia.com/kickstarter/retailers\nFor information on group orders:    https://www.vesuviusmedia.com/kickstarter/group-orders\nComponents are from the Up your Game collection! These components can also be used with many other boardgames to enhance your experience!\nIf you missed the Dwar7s Winter Kickstarter campaign, this is your chance to get the expansion! Keep in mind that the Legendary Expansion is FULLY compatible with Dwar7s Spring too! This add-on includes the cards from the \"Legendary Conversion Pack\".\n* If you missed the Dwar7s Winter Kickstarter, this add-on gets you everything from the Winter Season, including the \"Legendary Conversion Pack\" shown below.\n* If you already have the Kickstarter Edition of Dwar7s Winter, you need this pack to use the monsters and the classes from the Legendary Expansion with Dwar7s Spring.\n* This set of Dwarfs minis is exactly the same as the one included with Dwar7s Winter. Dwar7s Spring comes with punchboard tokens for your dwarfs. If you have the Dwar7s Winter game, then you can use that set to play Spring, or you can purchase a 2nd set with this add-on.\nThese sleeves work with ALL seasons and editions of the Dwar7s Series\n The following is a list of the number of cards per game:\nDwar7s Spring: 136\nEnchanted Forest Expansion: 80-100 (depending on SGs)\nConversion Pack: 20\nLegendary Expansion: 40\nDwar7s Winter: 84\nElven Uprising: 37\n3rd Edition comes in a big box that includes the core game and the Royal Decree Expansion. The box has enough room to fit all the other expansions of the season!\nWe will charge shipping after the Kickstarter concludes based on the actual costs incurred to ship. Payment will be collected via our pledge manager after the campaign ends. Shipping costs vary widely based on where you will receive your reward. Unfortunately, a one size fits all price isn't manageable.\nWe will pay to ship your rewards to our international distribution centers. Based on your delivery address, we will ship to you from one of the hubs below:\nUK: GamesQuest\nAsia: VFI\nAustralia: Aetherworks\nCanada: Snakes & Lattes\nUSA: QuarterMaster\nGermany, Rest of Europe & Rest of the World: Happyshops\nUK & Brexit:\nThe delivery time of the game is scheduled for May 2020. Right now, the UK is in an unstable and unknown status as far as its relationship with the EU is concerned. There is no way for us to predict how this is going to end and what repercussions this might inflict on shipping. Our goal is to bring the games into the EU and then find the best way to transfer them to the UK. We are monitoring the situation and will let you know more when we do.\nBrazilian Backers:\nWe are going to be using VFI to give you Custom-Friendly shipping solution. We understand that this might take a little longer to be fulfilled but at least there will be NO custom fees and extra surprise charges for your pledge!\nCurrently, just like the Dwar7s Fall Collector's Edition, Dwar7s Spring will NOT be published by Mandala Jogos within Brazil.\nThe following is a list of rough estimates for shipping of the basic pledge. Please keep in mind that these are just estimates, and costs may rise based on weight increases from unlocked stretch goals and any optional add-ons you choose. All prices are listed in US dollars.\nHawaii, Alaska, Puerto Rico and other remote states are not part of the \"US\" category. They are included in the \"Rest of the world\" category.\nPlease note, the core game and stretch goals will be in separate game boxes. We expect the shipping box will be 29 cm x 29 cm x 16 cm. The estimated shipping rates below are based on this large box size.\nPICKUP LOCATIONS\nIf you happen to be close to any of the following locations, then you can choose the \"Pick up\" pledge and not pay shipping costs!\nHalifax, Canada\n The Board Room Cafe: 1256 Barrington St, Halifax NS, B3J 1Y6\n Cape & Cowl Collectibles: 536 Sackville Dr, Lower Sackville NS, B4C 2R8\nWe will ask you to specify the exact pick up location in the pledge manager after the end of the campaign.\nAthens, Greece\n \u039a\u03ac\u03b9\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1 \u03a0\u03b5\u03b9\u03c1\u03b1\u03b9\u03ac: \u0391\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c4\u03ad\u03bb\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2 11, 18535, \u03a0\u03b5\u03b9\u03c1\u03b1\u03b9\u03ac\u03c2 (\u03c4\u03b7\u03bb. 210 4296845)\n No Label X: \u039c\u03c0\u03cc\u03c4\u03b1\u03c3\u03b7 4, 106 82, \u0391\u03b8\u03ae\u03bd\u03b1\n Meeple on Board: \u03a0\u03b9\u03c4\u03c4\u03b1\u03ba\u03ae 7, 17122, \u039d\u03ad\u03b1 \u03a3\u03bc\u03cd\u03c1\u03bd\u03b7\nWe will ask you to specify the exact pick up location in the pledge manager after the end of the campaign.\nWe want to thank all of the backers who have been supporting us and helping us create and deliver great games. That is why we created a special Loyalty program.\nWhenever you select a pledge that has the Vesuvius Media Loyalty Credit item in it, you will receive a $5 Loyalty Credit for our next Kickstarter campaign to be used for add-ons.\nThis extra credit will be visible during the checkout process of the Hive Pledge Manager and you will be able to use it to buy add-ons (it can not be used for a main pledge nor for shipping costs).\nKeep in mind that the Loyalty Credit is per campaign and not per game. This means that if you backed us only in one campaign, even if you added all three games in a bundle, you will receive $5 credit. We do this to be fair to backers who have paid more shipping costs by supporting us in multiple campaigns.\nIf you have Loyalty Credit from previous campaigns and choose not to use it in this one, then you will have an additional $5 for the next one.\nTo be eligible for the Loyalty credit, you must pledge for a reward during this campaign. Late-pledges and pledges of $1 will not qualify for any type of Loyalty credit (credit from past campaigns or credit for future campaigns).\nVesuvius Media is a small (but mighty!), Canadian, indie development company. Starting off by producing online strategy games, Vesuvius Media has branched into new areas of production and currently boasts online games, mobile games, graphic novels and board games in its portfolio.\nWhat makes Vesuvius Media different from all the other companies? Vesuvius Media is community-driven. Whether online or on the table, its game designers and developers interact with players, listen, debate, and continually gather feedback. Its community of players help shape the future of its games!\nTo date, Vesuvius Media has successfully Kickstarted ten (10) board game projects:\n Centauri Saga (Produced and Successfully Delivered) \n Cosmic Pioneers (Produced and Successfully Delivered) \n Dwar7s Fall (Produced and Successfully Delivered) \n Centauri Saga: Season 1 (Produced and Successfully Delivered) \n Covil: The Dark Overlords (Produced and Successfully Delivered) \n Dwar7s Winter (Produced and Successfully Delivered) \n Dwar7s Fall Collector's Edition (Produced and Successfully Delivered) \n Nocturion (Produced and Successfully Delivered) \n MonstroCity (Production under way, estimated delivery January 2020)\n Up Your Game (Production under way, estimated delivery April 2020)\nYou can check out our Kickstarter Projects' history  and stats on this cool website:\nhttps://www.tabletopanalytics.com/creator/vesuvius-media-ltd-78\nWe learn from our mistakes, we listen to your suggestions, and we strive to become better.

Supplier shortage, holiday traffic and weather conditions are just a few of the reasons a production could be delayed. Vesuvius Media Ltd should not be held responsible for delays caused by third parties. In addition, some of the items shown might differ from the final product due to supplier/manufacturer error.\n\nMISSING/DAMAGED ITEMS\n\nWhen dealing with a large number of orders, there is always a chance that errors will occur. If after you receive your order, you find that there are items missing, please contact us at support [at] vesuviusmedia.com and we will send you the missing items as soon as possible.\n\nIf your package arrives damaged, please take a few photos of all damaged items and email them to us at support [at] vesuviusmedia.com. We will send you replacements for the damaged items as soon as possible. The games shipped through this campaign will be sent out in a larger and stronger package, which will better protect the contents against damage.\n\nDELIVERY DATE\n\nOur current estimation for delivery is May 2020. We want your orders to be delivered on time as much as you do; however, history has shown that despite the best laid plans there is always a chance of delay.\n\nUNDELIVERED ITEMS\n\nIf a package is not delivered due to a backer's fault (wrong address given, backer didn't claim the delivered package from their post office, etc), the backer may be requested to pay additional shipping fees for the item to be sent out again.\n\nDELIVERY ADDRESS\n\nAfter this campaign, you will be requested to complete a survey through which you can let us know which items you have ordered as well as where you would like us to ship your order. Keep in mind that your order may be shipped sooner or later than the estimated delivery date. Please give us an address that will surely not change (If for example you think that you may be moving to a new house around May, please give us the address of a friend or relative to ensure a successful delivery).\n\nSHIPPING\n\nPlease read the Shipping section above.\n\nORDER FULFILLMENT\n\nPlease note that your order may be delivered in multiple packages. This is done due to weight limitations for group shipments. Even though the items you ordered will be shipped at the same time, there is always a chance they will arrive to you several days apart. This may occur due to each country's postal service sort-and-dispatch system.\n\nUPDATES\n\nThrough this campaign you may receive updates on Vesuvius Media's other upcoming projects.

Inspired by genre classics, this is an online adventure that sets you adrift in an intricate fairytale world... but it\u2019s also an invitation to roleplay without the restraints of linear quests and plotlines. Feel at liberty to travel the free wilds and vivid cities of the Braided Shore peninsula. Wander deep into the layers of this hand-drawn world, stumble upon its hidden places or unravel one of its many mysteries. There is no overarching goal, no real beginning or end, and ultimately you are in charge of shaping your own journey. It\u2019s a land of elusive creatures, lush natural beauty and pastoral calm... but one that has known troubles and where shadows play their part.    \n\u201cMight and Delight\u2019s peaceful online adventure could change the way we think of multiplayer experiences.\u201d \nRachel Watts, PCgamer.com\nRight from the start, our ambition was to take the conventional elements of traditional RPGs and use them to make something new \u2013 specifically, a world where players can enjoy calm exploration, discovery, and quietly forged companionships. We knew that we wanted to offer the sensation of being a wanderer in a wild, luscious, unexplored world, where you can form friendships and overcome obstacles \u2013 alone or together.   \nWe\u2019re pleased with what we have made so far: an online RPG that focuses more on roleplaying and personality traits than on stats and numbers. There are no linear quest lines built into the game, instead we wanted Book of Travels to be a truly living world, one where you\u2019ll stumble across events and characters unexpectedly. It\u2019s up to you to follow the leads you gather and piece together the stories of Braided Shore.\nIn making our previous games we found that there\u2019s an appetite for games that allow players to delve deep into a world and to slowly thread together events, moments, and emotions into something that\u2019s all their own. With Book of Travels we\u2019re bringing the same interpretive, creative style of play to a much bigger world.\n\u201cThis is exactly what we need to challenge what people think when they think of multiplayer games\u201d  \nBree Royce, Massivelyoverpowered.com  \nWhen emotion plays a part\nYour interactions and choices will have effects that you might not expect in traditional RPGs. Acting with curiosity and thoughtfulness will evolve your character in the same way as performing tasks or undertaking endeavours. Events that are usually trivialized in RPGs are instead made into strong emotional moments. Witnessing a death, for example, will weigh more heavily on your character for each day that passes, but by visiting the deceased\u2019s resting place, your grief will be transformed into a new energy \u2013 one that will remove that weight and strengthen you instead.   \nWordless communication for richer roleplay\nWhen it comes to in-game communication, we\u2019ve found that playing with a limited range of expression makes for more involving interaction between players \u2013 that\u2019s why there\u2019s no text chat in the game. In Book of Travels, you\u2019ll communicate with other players using a unique set of emotes and symbols which are unlocked as you experience new things. This means that you\u2019ll gain symbols to express \u2018boat\u2019 and \u2018market\u2019 once you\u2019ve encountered them. We\u2019ve used this bold kind of game design before, and we fell in love with how wordless communication boosted players\u2019 creativity as they found ways to say a lot with very little. This made for a more immersive kind of roleplay and also had a very positive effect on the culture amongst our community.  \n\u201cBook of Travels clearly shows the gaming community\u2019s desire for a fresh concept for an MMORPG\u201d\nMarc Marasigan, MMOS.com \nTMORPG \u2013 Tiny Multiplayer Online\nBook of Travels also differs from traditional MMOs because of its multiplayer design. Instead, we\u2019re calling it a TMO \u2013 a Tiny Multiplayer Online. That\u2019s because there really won\u2019t be anything \u2018massive\u2019 about the multiplayer aspect of the game. Instead we\u2019re building a game experience where there will just be a few people on each server, and when you cross paths, we want it to be a memorable moment. Should you choose to wander alone you won\u2019t be missing out on any of the world\u2019s wonder and enchantment. But if you do want to form a band of Travellers, the scarcity of other folk will make your companionships special and your group\u2019s bond that much deeper.  \nYou never know what lies ahead\nAs you play you\u2019ll encounter countless randomly occurring events. These can be anything from townsfolk that pass you by, a flock of deer, a travelling merchant or an event that tells a story. Some events will inspire you to seek out particular places or follow leads, others will need immediate action and decision-making from you and your group. Events have certain conditions, such as \u2018can only appear during night\u2019 or \u2018only occurs in x location when raining\u2019. This complex design is what makes the game truly unique: it will present something different each time you play, giving every player a different story to share. Beneath this structure lie multiple large and small plotlines for you to uncover and by sharing your findings (on the game\u2019s Discord server, for example) you can start to peel back the layers of an immensely deep world of stories and secrets. We\u2019ve worked on this part of the game more than any other \u2013 making the world ever-changing, and giving it a life of its own. \n\u201dIt sounds like nothing else, this could be one of the most unique RPGs I've seen in a very long time.\u201d \nLiam Dawe, gamingonlinux.com \nCollaborate to delve deeper\nBook of Travels is meant to be played in many different ways. It\u2019s a game perfect for players who want to adventure alone, because there are no typical linear quest lines, and there\u2019s so much to experience through free exploration. But the game is also tailored to be exciting when travelling with a band of new found friends. There are events in the game that we call Endeavours. These are things that players in groups can interact with, and they can trigger a variety of outcomes. Endeavours come in four categories; Mystical, Physical, Social and Mechanical. A group might find a machine that requires them to collaborate to activate it. They might come across a boat to reach a far away island. They might simply encounter a social situation that demands more than one player. This design is a key part of our intention to create a multiplayer culture based on roleplaying, social interaction and collaboration rather than PVP.  \nBraided Shore is a fantasy world that blurs the lines between many things: between civilisation and nature, industrialism and magic, people and beings. It\u2019s a culture in which honour and humanity is celebrated, but it\u2019s not without its shadows. It\u2019s an early industrial society that has one foot firmly rooted in tradition. \nClick to enlarge\nThe region is inhabited by many spirit beings, but none are more prominent than the Sefra. Sefra are solitary and volatile and live in regions of the peninsula they have chosen to inhabit and protect. This doesn\u2019t mean that they are at odds with humans \u2013 they often live peacefully alongside them, sometimes even working with their councils \u2013 but they are known for their unpredictability and their tempers can have huge consequences. \nThere are two common types of magic in Braided Shore, but they don\u2019t belong to the realm of conventional wizardry. Knots are used as a means of communication but may also be magic. In Knotcraft, binding can be used to conjure magic energies \u2013 they are always potent and usually benign. One type of knot may conjure \u2018light\u2019 while another may conjure \u2018smoke\u2019 or \u2018shelter\u2019. Brewing tea isn\u2019t always a magical ritual either (folk love to visit tea houses or sup tea together with friends) but neither is it uncommon to perform a tea ceremony wherein a special tea is brewed to endow the drinker with wondrous abilities, such as invisibility, healing and weather resistance.\nThe Braided Shore Lore Compendium gives much more detail on these practices, their common use and their history, as well as on all things Braided Shore.   \nAs this campaign grows we will be populating an area in the game known as Travellers\u2019 Meadow with Night Flowers, one for every backer. Night Flowers are a rare find on Braided Shore and the particular blue of their petals is very unusual throughout the region. What\u2019s more, they become luminescent in warm weather, and in large clusters will illuminate any fair-weathered night.\nWe can\u2019t wait to see Travellers\u2019 Meadow fill with Night Flowers! And when you play Book of Travels, Travellers\u2019 Meadow will be your special place \u2013 a place to rest, meet up with other Travellers. So back us and watch the empty meadow shimmer with the blue glow of Night Flowers!  \n7,000+ Night Flowers in Travellers\u2019 Meadow\nMany have likened the gameview to a living picture book \u2013 a perfect summary! Technically, this is because the game uses a camera that only moves in two dimensions, creating an almost orthographic field of view, and mixing 3D spaces with flat 2D sprites. Regardless of definition, the way the game looks and is navigated is quite rare.\nOur inspiration started with classic isometric RPGs, but we wanted to find a way to bring a more cinematic scope to the scenes. Using a unique mix of techniques, we\u2019ve designed Book of Travels to make your character feel small, letting the landscape around you play a bigger role. The experience is much like walking freely inside a page in a book, taking in the richly illustrated world around you.\nWe\u2019re proud to share some of the art from the development phase below!

Founded by artists in 2010, the studio is comprised of people from all kinds of different backgrounds. We have released seven games, all of which have a highly crafted visual style and explore emotionally engaging themes such as loss, freedom and solitude. Few of these games fit neatly into genres, but what they have in common is the way they allow players to explore, to speculate and to reflect.  \nOur experienced team has worked for leading game studios and has together shipped over 40+ games outside of Might and Delight.\nThis isn\u2019t our first online game: Meadow, now in its fourth year, connected players who loved the Shelter games allowing them to explore together, communicating with emotes and unlocking magical obelisks. We had no idea that Meadow would go on to bring so much enjoyment for such a long time. We\u2019ve been overwhelmed by the stories and artwork that Might and Delight players have made and shared \u2013 it\u2019s really shown us how rich and deep this kind of gameplay can be! Making Meadow and getting to know its community have inspired us to make a TMO of a much different, much bigger kind. \nMight & Delight games wouldn\u2019t be what they are without the input of our community \u2013 put simply, community support and feedback help us design better games. We want to invite more people in at an earlier stage of development, so that you can help us make the game that you want to play.\nWe\u2019re already funded enough to get us through production, but this campaign will mean the game can evolve and expand, because we\u2019ll be listening to your ideas and adding them into the world... Which of course means you get to play a bigger and better game, but also that you\u2019ll know that you helped to create it!\nWe\u2019ve been working on these rewards for a long time now. developing them to help enrich your game experience and help you get to know the Braided Shore. Please take a look and see which one might suit you best!    \nMemento and signed artwork:\nWe will release Book of Travels in 2020 and we\u2019re also looking into offering an early access launch. When the campaign is over we\u2019ll keep backers updated with development milestones. After release, the game will be available on Steam for $30.00 and wherever you buy Book of Travels, there will be no subscription fee.\nWe will continue to evolve the world, its lore and its backstory, adding events and levels for years to come. Right now we are committed to updating the project for a five year period, post-release.\nThank you so much for taking the time to learn about our work!

Even if the combat is not the protagonist, now it's there. That means that now you have to be aware whilst travelling because of monsters and bandits, and probably your character can now die. That doesnt sound serene or zen at all. Looks like what might have been a peaceful night walk through the woods is going to be now a \"be careful of the monsters till you reach the next town\" like in every other game. It's easy to realize that the combat totally breaks the core idea of a serene game with no action involved. That's the problem for me: Something that sounded very unique now sounds like every other game premise. I really don't like combat in games and I pledged for this one because the original premise had the dogma of \"zen travell, no combat\". Now I must be aware while travelling, looking how to be stealthy, running away from bandits, or in search for people to kill for me whilst playing. You know, there is no accounting for taste, but for someone like me, who dislikes combat in videogames, finding this videogame with a creative idea and a premise of no combat and then losing that important point is very painful. I think it changed to much since the campaign and now it's not for me at all.

For a group, I think it would require some way to indicate consensus (at the very easiest; a harder option would be to allow people to become absent from the group and continue on their own original path). It would sort of be like how, in a game, you create a save file, and when you decide that you borked up the game, you can simply reload the game from that spot. I realize it's more difficult with groups of people in an MMORPG environment, but it would be interesting (and, if you implement it, would require one or more extremely experienced characters). You could even build up to it with a skill that gradually makes the character aware of the in-game equivalent of the Schroedinger equation (quantum evolution), then can \"dream\" along a world track branch for a little while, then can shift themselves (only if completely alone) for an extremely limited period of time, and so forth. (If I sound like I'm babbling, the references I'm thinking of are Neal Stephenson's \"Anathem\" and \"Something Deeply Hidden\" by Sean Carroll, although the latter is keen to remind us that quantum branching is about quantum events, not macro-scale decisions (as far as we know)).", "time": "over 1 year ago"}, {"username": "Heather Phelps", "content": "I'm so excited for Flik!

I think that when you are presented by a rich lore or a rich history that influence how you act or how you think about what you are doing and the world around you instantly are more engaged", "time": "over 1 year ago"}, {"username": "Cass Whittington", "content": "I hope doing a tea ceremony for a friend is one of the skills", "time": "over 1 year ago"}, {"username": "Lumengast", "content": "Not like I suspect walking in circles to be the common pastime, but it'd be fun following someone's tracks only to find other players relaxing in a cave with some tea.", "time": "over 1 year ago"}, {"username": "Kushaja", "content": "Nevertheless, all the best with the campaing (its going rather well to say the least) and with the game.

I'm so excited to return with another Kickstarter in a series of Kickstarters I have planned for my Birthstone Goddesses collection!  For my previous Kickstarters, my fans helped to create a Birthstone Goddesses coloring book and the first pins in a set of 12 enamel pins inspired by this same project.\nFor those who don't know me, I'm the artist and author of Angelic Visions, a howto book that teaches readers how to paint fantasy angels.  Now, I'm working on a body of work called the Birthstone Goddesses.  Each goddess embodies a month of the year reflecting the folklore, flowers, and birthstones for her respective month.\nThe entire series of Birthstone Goddesses!\nYou can keep up with the BIRTHSTONE GODDESSES project and the future plans I have for it at:\n| Website | Twitter | Facebook | Tumblr | Instagram | PATREON |\nMockups represent pin concepts. Final products may vary.\nThere will be 12 pins total, one for each Birthstone Goddess, but to make this project more manageable, I am breaking the entire set of enamel pins down into 4 total campaigns, each one representing a season of the year.  This campaign features the 2nd set of pins, the GODDESSES OF AUTUMN, the Ladies of September, October, and November!\nBy pledging to this Kickstarter, you are locking in a special pricing of $13 per pin!  After this campaign, the pins will be listed at $15.\nDid you miss out on the first set of pins, the GODDESSES OF SUMMER?  Find them available for Pre-Order in my Etsy shop!\nHere's a video of how the GODDESSES OF SUMMER pins came out!\nPin Specs\nMATERIAL:  The GODDESSES OF AUTUMN pins will be HARD ENAMEL pins made with the cloisonn\u00e9 method, which produces a superb finish with resistance to scratches and damage.  They will be created with high polished gold plating and include metal clutches for the back.\nSandblasted Gold - Areas of the pins, such as the headpieces in September and October and the spots in November's lace trim, will be accented with a textured metallic gold.\nAn example of the sandblasted gold effect on the pins.\nSIZE:  These pins will be 2 inches (50mm) at their longest dimension.\n IMPORTANT NOTE!  Shipping will be charged outside of Kickstarter via my fulfillment management system (Backerkit) using the lowest rate available for shipments with USPS.  Tracking will be included in the cost of shipping, but insurance will not be included unless specifically requested, which you can do so via private message here on Kickstarter.\nThe cost of shipping is NOT included with your pledge and will be collected after the campaign via Backerkit!  Instructions will be sent via email after the campaign has been fully funded and completed.\nWhy is it so expensive to ship the book outside of the US?  Unfortunately, the coloring book is 9x12 inches, which makes its shipping container constitute as a large package, which drives up the cost of shipping.  I apologize for the inconvenience, but this is simply out of my control!\nIf you'd still like the coloring experience without the hassle of shipping, I have the book's entire collection of line art available as downloadable digital packs and single pages here.\nInternational Backers must be prepared to pay for customs fees, as I will not be providing refunds or exchanges for those who later refuse or abandon their packages based on being unable to pay the dues or any other reason that results in package refusal.  All international packages will be marked as 'merchandise' in accordance with shipping laws for commercial purchases.\nTo get a better look at the art of the prints, check out the Birthstone Goddesses gallery. \nNEW Original Art Tier Added!\nTo claim any art bundle, pick the appropriate Reward tier OR switch your current pledge to the appropriate tier.\nSTRETCH GOAL #1 - Shimmering Pearlescent Enamel - $3000\nIf we unlock this goal, we'll be able to add a special touch to the pins!  I'll add a shimmering pearlescent swirl texture to Lady of September's disc and Lady of October's veil and dress!  GOAL UNLOCKED!\nSTRETCH GOAL #2 - Goddesses of Autumn Sticker Set - $3200\nIf we unlock this goal, I'll add 4 inch vinyl stickers of the pin designs to all tiers with physical Rewards!  They will also be made available in the Add-On shop for those who want to pick up some.\nSTRETCH GOAL #3 - Little Gem Goddesses of Autumn Sticker Set - $3400\nIf we unlock this goal, I'll add 4 inch vinyl stickers of all three Little Gem Goddesses of Autumn to tiers with physical Rewards!  They will also be made available in the Add-On shop for those who want to pick up some.\n\nSTRETCH GOAL #4 - Metallic Upgrade for Stickers - $4000\nIf we unlock this goal, I'll add a metallic foil finish to the Goddesses of Autumn 4 inch vinyl stickers!\nYou will be able to add the following Add-Ons to your Kickstarter items via Backerkit after the campaign is over.  Miss your chance to get a pin or want to purchase extra gifts for a loved one? You can add these items to your Kickstarter items once the campaign ends and is successfully funded!\nSome of these items marked \"Kickstarter Add-On Shop Exclusive\" will be available ONLY for Kickstarter Backers after the campaign!  Instructions on how to purchase these Add-Ons will be sent via email after the campaign is successfully funded and completed.\nSee more art from the prints and products below at the Birthstone Goddesses shop.\nIf the sticker sets from the Stretch Goals are unlocked, they will be added to the Add-On shop as well.\nWith your help, we can make this collection a reality.  I can't wait to begin!\nIMPORTANT PROJECT DISCLAIMER!\nWhile I will do my very best to contact each and every one of you about your items via Kickstarter and via emails sent using Backerkit, if you have not paid your shipping and claimed your Kickstarter items (and any Add Ons) via Backerkit within 3 months after the surveys have been sent out (a fact I will announce here within Updates and via email), your items will be declared 'abandoned' and will be returned to my inventory.  No refunds or exchanges will be given after this point!\nPlease be sure to use an email for Kickstarter that you actively check and to check your Updates regularly, as I will not be held responsible for abandoned items!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe proofs for the pins have already been APPROVED and are prepped and ready to be manufactured as soon as I have the funds.

Other products, such as prints, can be easily printed based on the demands of this campaign.\n\nShipping estimated to begin between end of November and mid-December. I will do my best to get them out by the holidays, but I can make no promises! Backers will have a final chance to upgrade their shipping addresses before items are sent.\n\nAny delays will be communicated through Updates. I will provide an update at least once a month with a status on this project or when important milestones are reached and/or I need Backer responses.\n\nI have experience successfully delivering previous Kickstarters which involved enamel pins, coloring books, prints, and many other items and have a fulfillment management system in place to aid fulfillment in going smoothly.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "Goddesses of Autumn Coloring Pack", "descp": "Thanks for your support!

Since Rose joined us full time in 2018 as a developer, we've been steaming ahead turning these ideas into a tightly woven narrative puzzle experience. \nRose has done an incredible job of tieing together a fantastic, dramatic narrative threaded through over 50 carefully engineered puzzles inspired by dozens of escape games, escape rooms and puzzle books, as well as an unreasonably large pile of reference books.\nRecruiting the help of Oxford University Egyptology researcher Dr Edward Love who inspired us with loads of historical examples of Egyptian codes, ciphers and language quirks, we've attempted to make not only a satisfying game, but an informative and accurate one too! A great big thank you to Johanna and Roland, too - without whom the game wouldn't anywhere near as beautiful as it is!\nA massive thank you to all of our early playtesters, who've helped us make this the best it can be. Thanks to: \nAmy Nash, Andy Mackay, Becky Todd, Bernard, Britt Callebaut, Brooke B., Daniel Pitcock, Dave Wetherall, Donald Stanley, Eric Mazelis, Erik Cole, Frans Treur, Grant Miner, Ian Stronach, James Olson, Jens Grimmel, Jeremy Skrdla, Jing Lim, Jolien Bortier, Justin Bird, Justine, Ken Whitehurst, Kevin Beeckmans-Cop, Linda Canton, Liz Howald, Loriana Giuliani, Nic, Peter 'Pedro' Goins, Sally, Simon Westenra, Stephen Spikings, Theo Edwards, Aidan Reynolds, Benedicte Wulff, Alex Hopkins, Jiaqi Li .", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nGAME DESIGN: \nWe first came up with this idea over a year ago, and since then have been tirelessly researching both the thematic and structural aspects of the project. While between us, we've played dozens of puzzle games, gone through dozens of puzzle books, and completed half of London's escape rooms, we knew that for a game this ambitious, we needed something more. We recruited over 100 playtesters from around the world and got their feedback over multiple rounds of testing to ensure that the puzzles work exactly as we designed them to. Even after that, we need to make sure it all ticks like clockwork - and will be doing additional rounds of testing after the campaign before we get to print. The challenge for us is if there are lots of small edits to make, and ensuring that we get through those properly in good time. As Rose has done a spectacular job so far in this regard, we're confident that this will not affect the overall timeline projection. \n\nILLUSTRATION & GRAPHIC DESIGN \nAnyone who's backed our projects before knows that we spend a huge amount of time working on our artwork and graphic design. Johanna has completed the artwork for 90% of the puzzles, the journal and all other assets needed to wrap up the project for print. You can see many of her illustrations throughout the campaign. That said, there's a few more to be done and there may be tweaks needed in the final proofing stage. We've put a formal timeline in place to account for this, and have allowed several 'check points' to ensure that the artwork is up to scratch and consistent with the puzzle refinements we might make. All the packaging and box design is already complete and print-ready.\n\nMASS MANUFACTURE \nA year ago, as part of the Sub Terra Documentary promised from our \u00a3300,000 stretch goal, we visited the factory in Shanghai. We inspected all the pieces of equipment and production lines, met with staff and talked through our production objectives with their team, to ensure that we know exactly how your games are made. This means we've already avoided many of the costly mistakes that can catch projects off guard, and optimised the product design to take into account the way the machines and team produce the games - meaning they'll produce them better, faster! Nevertheless, we're working closely with the manufacturer for this project, Longpack, to ensure that every tiny detail is produced according to our high standards, and so that it delivers the excellent experience you expect. We'll be keeping close communication with them until we've confirmed everything is 100% and has been checked in the fulfillment warehouses.\nAs an additional assurance, we're spending two weeks with the Longpack team in Shanghai and around China inspecting the factory and their suppliers in November this year.\n\nFREIGHT & FULLFILMENT \nShipping hundreds or even thousands of games around the world is a complex project, and we've learned an enormous amount from our previous four successful campaigns. We've already calculated the plans for shipping games to 4 regional warehouses and fulfilling locally from there, as well as factoring in a realistic amount of contingency time for the not uncommon delays associated with sea freight of the games from the factory in China to the warehouses around the world. Additionally, we've optimised the product design of the game to account for shipping charge thresholds on dimensions and weight - ultimately saving you money.\n\nUNFORESEEN EVENTS \nDelivering a complex tabletop game Kickstarter project successfully is a challenge in itself, with a huge number of variables in play at any given time, and a large variety of places where things can go wrong. Due to the nature of this process, some things may change, but we are dedicated to making sure everyone is fully informed of any planned changes to content, the timeline or any other relevant information.

A team that wants to do things professionally, knowing the number of their members and energy required to deliver a project, the capacity of the factory, and wouldn't cast such a wide net. The impression is of putting things on the backburner (this project for example) to develop other projects, attend fairs a.s.o. Following the end of the campaign, I didn't get the impression that the team works to deliver this product in a manner that is respectful to the backers and that meeting any sort of deadlibes is a priority, quite the opposite. You win your audience with consistency and respect.
