The simple game play combined with clever scoring make this a brilliant casual game for gamers and non-gamers alike.\nNever-before seen Deluxe Version for just $5!\nThis project is a special 10-day project for \"pledge what you are able\".  We are offering a fixed number of rewards to get the game out there with just 1000 of the Deluxe Version with a minimum pledge of $5.  We encourage you to pledge what you are able, but if $5 is all you can pledge, that is ok for us.  This is a crazy experiment to see if \"seeding the market\" will pay off for future print runs!  Note shipping costs and add-ons will be collected post-campaign during the Crowdox Survey process.\n CRAZY Pricing! To be honest, we LOVE this game, but it failed on Kickstarter last time at $40/copy (HERE).  We had a brilliant looking project, good reviews and everything looked great, but wow did it fail!  Rather than just let this project die we have teamed up with the factory to reboot this game.  We are going to produce  1000 copies of the Deluxe game.  We are doing the Deluxe game with ALL stretch goals unlocked and asking you backers to pay what you can.  We know the world is a crazy place right now and lots of us are hurting.  We are strictly limiting this campaign to just a few copies and will NEVER produce the Deluxe edition again!  \n KS Limited Exclusive Content! Deluxe copies will NOT enter distribution. Don't miss out on these awesome extras. \n Stretch Rewards! All stretch rewards are UNLOCKED and every copy of the game will come with all the stretch rewards mentioned!\nhttps://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/247576/poetry-slam\nStep One: Reveal a Letter Card and a Word Prompt, then all players simultaneously write a word behind their screen that fits the rule (sorta like Scattergories but with only one word):\n Step 2: When you have completed your word grab a Speed Tile, first come first served!\n Step 3: Using the word you created from Step 1, form a simple poem to clue in your fellow players as to your word.\nHint: The poem should be sort of like clues from Dixit, not so easy that someone can guess it before you even finish with your poem, in that case you only get two points. It also shouldn't be so hard that no one can guess it, then you get no points. You want it to be difficult but not too difficult, so at least one person guesses correctly after you finish the poem for 3 points!\nTwo final details: Snap Tokens. You must give three +1 point Snap Tokens to other players during the game, but no more than one per round. You also accumulate Slam Tokens when you break rules or use forbidden letters.\nDownload the rules on BGG here!\nLearn how to play Poetry Slam from designer Adam Wyse!\nClick the image to jump to the full review\nClick the image to jump to the full video review.\nFrom BGG Ratings, click the image to jump to all comments.\nClick the image to read the full review\n As a reminder...

Because this is an ENGLISH word game we have made the difficult decision to ONLY ship to the USA/Canada/UK and EU, and as of April 8 we have added Japan and Australia by popular demand!  If you want a copy of the game and live outside of these areas please look into a mail forwarder service in the USA where we can ship your rewards to for further forwarding.\nWe added Australia and Japan by popular demand on Day 2 of the campaign!!\nUPDATE 4/8/2021: By popular demand we have added New Zealand, shipping is $32 for one copy or $51 for 2 copies of either version of the game to NZ. The Philippines is $22 for 1 copy or $32 for 2 copies, also by request!  Note because the game is HEAVY (over 3 pounds with the shipping box) we will ONLY ship via UPS to the lower 48 US states for USA backers.  If you live in Alaska, Hawaii, PR, APO or otherwise have a PO Box rather than a physical shipping address, sorry you are out of luck and we will NOT ship to you.  For all other regions note we are NOT offering this as \"VAT/CUSTOMS\" friendly.  We will put a stated value of what you paid for your rewards, but can't guarantee or be responsible for any fees you may pay to get your package.  We will ship to all non-USA areas via DHL.  VAT TAX for the EU/UK will be collected along with shipping costs on the Crowdox Survey.\nRetailers to pay $20 shipping via UPS.\nNote Regarding Late Surveys And Shipping\nWe won't ship rewards more than three (3) months after we finish shipping Poetry Slam from our warehouses. We'll be sure to make several attempts to reach any stragglers over those three months, but after that period of time, we'll consider any remaining pledges with an incomplete survey a donation to Mayday Games and any copies set aside will be sold through game stores and conventions.\nCreative Team\nWanna know more about the design process and hear Adam talk candidly about making his designer dreams a reality?

Around every corner goblins and ferocious minions seek to block the Heroes\u2019 path.  Where there isn\u2019t an enemy, traps are set, ready to spring on even the most prepared Hero.\nTiny Epic Dungeons features a modular dungeon that is unique with each play.\nThe game is played over 2 ACTS: the Dungeon and the Dungeon Boss. In both acts the players are constantly struggling against the waning firelight of their torch which decreases each turn. When the torch goes out, the Heroes are forever lost in the darkness.\nAfter clearing the dungeon of all its minions and finding the entrance to the lair, players must engage in an epic battle against the Boss. Each boss has unique abilities and a lair with a unique environment that gives various advantages and disadvantages depending on the skill used and where the Hero attacks from.\nThese Epic Monsters cannot be slain by mere swords, axes, arrows, and the occasional spell. Ritual Rooms around the dungeon must be used to lower their magical bond to the dungeon. The Dungeon boss must be lured to these rooms to lower their defenses and allow the Heroes to strike the final blow!\nVictory in Tiny Epic Dungeons is achieved by defeating the Dungeon Boss!\nIn order to do that, the Heroes will need to collect Legendary Loot, and Supreme Spells. \nHeroes of old crafted loot to honor the ways of their clans. Bear, Lion, Phoenix, and Panther. Heroes can discover pieces from these ancient sets that grow more powerful the more you collect. \nWill you be the greatest warrior the Bear clan has ever seen?

The Let\u2019s Dig for Treasure, Let\u2019s Summon Demons, and Don\u2019t Talk to Strangers games will immerse you into these hilariously dark retro worlds. Featuring clever and beautiful fan-favorite artwork, each game is a wild romp through the parallel Rhodes universe. The games are quick to learn and are created for 2-6 players, ages 14 and up.\nDynomite Games is an old-school sub-brand of Cryptozoic Entertainment. With a diverse portfolio of licensed and original IPs, Cryptozoic\u2019s catalog covers a broad spectrum of tabletop games and collectibles including Epic Spell Wars of the Battle Wizards and the DC Deckbuilding games.\n\nWe've made simple, streamlined game engines (with very little set-up time) so that anyone can dive right in--but we've seasoned the games with enough hidden depth and unique design space to satisfy all of you hardcore gamers too!\nCheck out a brief overview of each of these games:\nIt's the funky-freshest Push-Your-Luck experience out there, for the whole family! Just shuffle up the deck and divide it into 3 \"Dig Stacks\" and you're ready to start digging for treasure!\n1. On your turn, choose and \"dig up\" a card from any of the Dig Stacks...look for cards worth a lot of points, or cards that trigger a powerful effect, such as stealing a card from another player!  \n2. You can stop digging at any time, or keep digging up cards for as long as you want...the more cards you dig up before you \"stop,\" the more you stand to gain--but be careful--if you dig up a 2nd Worms Card, or even a SINGLE skeleton card, your turn will end immediately and you'll lose *EVERYTHING* you dug up so far (this turn)! \n3. Once an entire Dig Stack is empty, the game is over and players add up the total point values on their cards!  Be sure to look and see if you scored any \"bonus point\" effects (you did make sure to dig up some Milk to go with your Cookies, right?). \n4. You've got all kinds of zany stuff to find while digging: Loyal Dogs (protect you from a Skeleton!), Sewer Lines (worth negative points--give it to your least favorite opponent!), heck, you might even transcend death with The Crown of the Lich Lord, or turn those pesky worms into big points with Skwirmz the Worm God! \n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are little Johnny, Suzy, and Fido supposed to do when the suburban droll has them down? I know, Let's Summon Demons!  Whether you're building sadistic synergies with the \"rotten\" kids or sharing the love with the \"sweet\" kids, only the savviest (and luckiest!) player--the best Demon Summoner--will walk away a winner!\n1. Shuffle up the Demon Deck and the Block Deck, and deal everyone a Starting Candle and a hand of 3 Demons. Your goal is to summon all 3 of those little devils before your opponents beat you to it... \n2. At all times, a rotating assortment of five cards will be available for purchase (the low, low price of 3 soul tokens) to all players--this is called THE BLOCK and it has Boys, Girls, and Animals of every style and strategy! Look for cards that combo together! \n3. On each players' turn, they'll roll the dice--if any player's cards they've acquired \"match\" the total rolled then that card activates--often resulting in the acquisition of more soul tokens! More soul tokens means more cards from THE BLOCK, means even more soul tokens--but to what end?\n4. Well, you can sacr--er--discard 3 of your cards to SUMMON A DEMON! The most powerful cards of all! Once any player has summoned all 3 of their Demons --and has a balance of 10 souls on top of that--they are declared the ultimate Demon Summoner and the game is over! With all of the variety offered between the 20 unique demons and the diverse BLOCK DECK, there is plenty of content to explore and master!\n\n\n\n\n\nSchool's out but otherworldly STRANGERS are here!  Mom & Dad haven't caught on yet so you're on your own, kiddo. Play your cards as efficiently as you can, helping to navigate your Kids one at a time from SCHOOL to a SCORING space--in order to score as many points as you can before the neighborhood is completely overrun with STRANGERS!\n1. At the start of the game, each player will draw a hand of 3 cards and place one of their kids in the SCHOOL space. Your goal is to get that kid into a valuable scoring space, at which point you'll place a new kid in the SCHOOL space and repeat the process. Some spaces are worth more points at the end of the game, and some confer a unique bonus (for example, your hand size increases by 1 for each Kid you have in the Library). \n2. Remember, you want to score a good space, but you'll have to Walk, Run, Skateboard, School Bus, and even City Bus to get there! Each turn you'll play one card and draw a new card to replace it!  \n3. But watch out!  When any player draws a STRANGER card, they can abduct any kid on a \"STRANGER SPACE!\" Furthermore, now that a STRANGER is lurking in that space, it is impassable for all future movement...so you may just have to re-route your plans on the fly! SAUCER cards can abduct *any* kid--even one that has already scored--but your opponent will have to get lucky when they flip the SAUCER COIN or you'll escape abduction!\n\n\nLike what you see? Giggling with glee? Store each game together when you back all three! We personally guarantee that this sleek and convenient slipcase looks a lot better on your bookshelf than a haphazard stack of boxes!\n\n\n\n\n\nWe expect the game to start shipping in June 2021. It is English-only and we're shipping worldwide in partnership with Quartermaster Logistics. This game is \"friendly\" in terms of shipping (i.e., we cover customs/import taxes) to the US, Canada, EU, Australia, and New Zealand. Shipping rates are based on actual costs to ship your rewards (depending on your country) and will be charged as part of your pledge.\nPlease note: Due to COVID-19, most shippers have added surcharges to their rates. The amount we charge for shipping reflects the latest rates. In some regions, the cost of shipping may exceed the cost of the tier you\u2019re pledging for; unfortunately, this cannot be avoided. In most cases, pledging for two or three games (\u201cDouble Trouble\u201d and \"Slipcase Exclusive\" Tiers) costs almost the same in terms of shipping as pledging for one game.\n\n\n\nThis project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 1,100+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $460M raised between them.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is not our first rodeo!

That\u2019s where the Deck of Stories comes in.\nIt\u2019s a flexible story-telling system of story hooks that will get your creative juices flowing. Each hook features next steps that help take you deeper into the moment and the unique ORC storytelling system that suggests where it would fit best in a storyline.\nThis Kickstarter includes the release of the Deck of Stories Volumes 1 and 2, as well as five-themed boosters and the Deck of Stories: Genesis Box.\nIn addition to the Deck of Stories Volume 1, the Deck of Stories: Genesis Box contains a set of NPC and Sensory Cards to help fill out your story even more. The NPC Cards are pre-generated, beautifully illustrated characters that you can insert seamlessly into your game. Each NPC Card has an NPC along with five traits that help you role-play that character. Add one when your players catch you off guard and you need an NPC on the spot, or use them to help fill in the role of a new character in your game.\nThe Sensory Cards engage the five senses with unique details that you can add to your adventure. Any time your story feels flat, choose a Sensory Card from the deck and use it to fill out your description of a room, or add interest to a situation.\nWhether you're planning a story arc in your latest campaign or need an exciting one-shot for your next session, the Deck of Stories is a must-have tool for your story-creation arsenal.\n\n        Are you ready to create a legendary adventure?\nA crooked skeleton stands before you\nDeck of Stories is Compatible with Roll20\u00ae\nWe\u2019re happy to announce that digital versions of the cards will be available on Roll20.

After reading the prompts, arrange them in the order that makes the most sense to you, taking cues from the ORC story-telling system. Now you have a beginning, middle, and end for your story that\u2019s loose enough to adapt but structured enough to move the story forward. Not what you wanted? Shuffle and re-draw.\nA solid O, R, or C at the top of each card helps you decide where to place it in your story structure. Keep in mind that the story structure you create is not rigid.

You are racing down the streets, desperate to escape into the safety of the countryside. If your cart is the first out of town you and your cart-mates win! Or do you? Some villagers on your cart may secretly already have the plague. If you leave town with a plagued villager on your cart, you will catch the plague and lose! What will you do to make sure that doesn\u2019t happen? And who will you trust (or betray) along the way? \nBristol 1350 is a social deduction and light strategy game for 1-9 players. Learn in 10 minutes and play in 20-40 minutes.\n Thank you to all of our backers for an incredible campaign!\nIf you missed the campaign you can make a late pledge here until fall 2020.\nBackers can view project updates for information about delivery and add-ons.\nPlease visit our website or Facebook for the latest information on Bristol 1350.\nWe are excited to offer a Deluxe edition of the game! Depending on later demand, this Deluxe edition may be exclusive to Kickstarter, and at most it will be in rare distribution or only available at conventions. Beyond the core Standard edition of the game (+9 extra Kickstarter characters + stretch goals) the Deluxe edition includes: \nThe 6 Deluxe coins to scale.\nEvery Kickstarter backer of Bristol 1350 (Standard or Deluxe) will receive 9 extra character cards in a special foil pack to add to their core copy of the game (for 18 total characters!) These characters will not be available after Kickstarter and are our way of saying thank you. We will reveal a new character every few days in the section below!    \n\n\nWe have upgraded every single component in the game with the space available in the box. Each upgrade represents our dedication to making high-quality and high-performing games at an affordable price. While we hope to include most of the upgrades listed above in future editions, they are only guaranteed for this first Kickstarter Standard and Deluxe printing of the game.   \nThe level of textural detail on the book, front and back, is kind of mouthwatering.\nBristol 1350 is a social deduction (lying & backstabbing) and light strategy game for 1-9 players. Learn in 10 minutes and play in 20-40 minutes. The game is enjoyable at all player counts, with lower counts leaning towards strategy and higher counts leaning towards social deduction, lying, and trust.\nIn the game each player begins in one of the three carts behind the starting line. Your goal is to be on the first cart to escape from the town. However, if anyone on your cart has the plague when you finish, everyone on that cart dies of the plague! Play continues until an all-healthy cart crosses or until everyone has the plague.   \nYou can view the full rules and print and play at this link. Note that the rulebook design is still underway, and if you want to play the print and play you'll need to construct your own dice and carts.\nYou can play for free online with Tabletop Simulator or with Tabletopia. \nAs they become available, translations of the rulebook will be available on our website. We currently have translations available in French, German, Spanish, Italian, Dutch, and Greek. \nSome of the intriguing mechanics are discussed by The Board Game Critic in this video. \nA full playthrough of a 5-player game can be seen at this link. \nA full playthrough of a 1-player game can be seen at this link. \nBristol 1350 is Volume 4 in the Dark Cities Series! Each Volume is a stand-alone game that comes in the same sized faux book box, focuses on a particular city and year, and includes a dark or mysterious element in its game play. Each game accommodates at least 2-9 players. \nGames in the Dark Cities Series have already sold over 150,000 copies and are now played around the world! We're already hard at work on Volume 5, and we will continue expanding the series. We know your game closet is a mess. Start your bookshelf collection of games with the Dark Cities Series! Each of these games is available in certain reward levels and as add-ons.\nYou can add an unlimited number of copies of any games in the Dark Cities Series to your pledge! Just add the amounts listed above and after the campaign you'll select which extra games you'd like to be added to your order based on how much extra money you pledged. If you have any questions, please see the FAQ section, post a comment, or shoot us a message. \nYour shipping cost does not increase for add-ons regardless of your location or the amount of extra games you order. You will receive all add-on games at the same time that all of the Kickstarter rewards are received (estimated delivery April 2021).  \nThe 18 original character paintings by Sarah Keele are available to purchase! The paintings are 8 x 10 inches and made with mixed media acrylic on masonite board. You can see some of the intricate details below. Email sarahmkeele@gmail.com for more details or to check availability of a specific character.    \nThough this is not an add-on you can get through the campaign, the people at Next Level Board Gaming are selling 3D-printer files so that you can create an EPIC 3D version of the Bristol 1350 board that you can use with your copy of the game. You can see more details by clicking the picture below.\nRegardless of order size or add-ons, shipping costs are $6 USA, $8 UK/EU, $10 Australia/Canada, $12 for the rest of the world. We work hard to find the best shipping rates out there, and we subsidize some of the shipping costs so that you don't have to pay as much. \nTo avoid extra VAT or customs fees, games will ship to depots around the world (USA, UK, EU, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong) before being shipped to you. For non-depot countries, in most cases there will not be extra VAT costs because the price of our games is low enough to avoid the duties threshold.\nIf your order is lost or returned due to unforeseen circumstances, we will attempt to reship your game one time, free of charge. If you provided incorrect shipping information, you will be responsible for the reshipment fee. Due to unreliable mail systems, we will not perform reshipments destined for Brazil, Ukraine, Russia, or South Africa. \nThese days there are many projects that wait to charge shipping until AFTER the campaign ends in order to shift the risk from the creators to the backers. We have \"done our homework\" in regards to shipping costs and are prepared to take on unexpected risk. What you pay now for shipping is ALL that you will pay for this reward.\nDISCOUNTED PRICE | Normal MSRP of the Standard Edition will be $25. If we release the Deluxe Edition to the public it will be at least $45. We also offer the best shipping prices we can during the Kickstarter campaign.\nKICKSTARTER EXCLUSIVE CARDS | The 9 Kickstarter Exclusive character cards (for a total of 18 characters in your game) will never be available again and will be unavailable to the public. Additionally, campaign stretch goals, as well as the Deluxe version, are only guaranteed through Kickstarter.\nEARLY ACCESS | Receive and play the game before anyone else in the world. \nJOIN OUR TEAM | Get first-in-line knowledge and insight into the project, and a direct line of communication to us as the creators. We will take your feedback into account before launching production.\nWe fell in love with the Kickstarter community when we launched our first game, Salem, back in 2015. Those backers are the ones that allowed us to quit our day jobs and make games full time. We've had more great experiences with the launch of Tortuga 1667 and Deadwood 1876. The feedback, support, trust, and positivity from the community is incredible. We consider each Kickstarter backer to be a close ally in our game-making endeavors and we'll do everything we can to protect your trust in us.\nOur thoughts are with those around the world suffering from Covid-19. We have been planning and preparing for this launch for over two years, but it has coincidentally lined up with the pandemic that our world now faces. We considered delaying the project but after a lot of thought and encouragement from our community we ultimately decided to launch. As with all our games, part of this game's purpose is to educate about the history of the world. Bristol 1350 explores the history of the worst pandemic our world has ever faced: the Black Death. The people of 1350 faced huge challenges, and today those challenges are perhaps more relatable than ever. We will be donating $3,000 from our own pockets to Action Against Hunger to assist in getting food and medicine for those most in need. (Per Kickstarter regulations, funds raised within Kickstarter will not be directly donated and have no effect on the donation amount).\nThis project is promoted by Green Inbox", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our 4th project, and our first 3 have been delivered on time and as promised. Our factory is at full capacity and our shipping partners are optimistic that by next year when this is delivered there will be no insurmountable issues in regards to Covid-19. However, these are unique times and we will keep our backers updated on any unforeseen issues that may arise. As you can see from our photos, samples of the game have already been produced by our manufacturers and designs are complete. We just need to raise the funds and say go! \n\nSalem 1692: \"I have backed over 46 projects and I just wanted to say this project has been an absolute delight to have been a backer for. Your updates have been insightful, but not overbearing. You clearly put a lot of time, thought, and effort into this game and it really shows. I was impressed with how fast this project came together. It was a fast, well organized campaign. Kudos to you and thank you for a wonderful end product. I couldn't be happier.\" -Snuffles00\n\nTortuga 1667: \"I backed this and another project that ended a day prior. The way things have gone with the other project have given me an even greater appreciation for not only the great game you made, but the well executed Kickstarter. Thank you again!\" -Bored Gamer\n\nDeadwood 1876: \"Thank you again for such a wonderful campaign and game! All your games are creative, refreshing, and each have unique mechanics that keep the fun going for hours. The historical component too makes for an added boon. Thank you also for a unique genuineness you bring to your customer experience. It is a prize how you answer each customer individually and how you care about the quality of your interactions as much as you care about the quality of your product and gameplay. I\u2019m excited for the fourth city and experience!\" -Steph Troyer\n\nAfter the campaign we will use a pledge manager system called CrowdOx to send a survey to the email associated with your Kickstarter account. You will be able to choose your add-on orders and provide your shipping information at that time. If you change addresses before we ship your rewards, you will be able to access your survey up until a few weeks before we ship.

As so many of us worry about the future and yearn to return to the glorious spring unfolding outside our quarantined windows, we're excited to bring you our newest, most enchanted project...\n\nCreated by illustrator Kevin Jay Stanton, this 78-card deck features traditional paintings rooted in classical tarot interpretations that delve into the lore and mythology of the plant kingdom.\nFor over five hundred years, humans have used Tarot cards as a tool for divination and meditation. Their archetypal symbols have mystical, philosophical and psychological implications that allow us to understand our past, our future, and ourselves. But even older than that is the symbolism we've always assigned to the plants that grow around us. Hermetic, alchemical and scientific traditions explore flowers as tools for making meaning, medicine and magic. \nBOTANICA marries the tradition of Tarot to a lexicon far more ancient: the natural vocabulary of life on Earth. \n\nBOTANICA takes all of the major and minor arcana of traditional Tarot and reinvents them in the language of flowers. The Queen of Swords is Red Oleander. The Hermit is a Chinese Lantern. The High Priestess is the Elderflower. The Devil is Nightshade.\n\nThe deck features  the complete set of 78 Tarot cards, illustrated with acrylic and ink paintings. The Major Arcana are defined by single plants and flowers, and the Minor Arcana are plants combined with the objects from their suit, with regalia on the court cards.\nThe cards are 3.25\" x 4.15\", printed on premium heavyweight card stock and emblazoned on the back with gold foil. Each deck will come with a booklet naming the plants and objects on each card, and explaining the symbolic meanings of each card. \nThe set comes in three editions: THE HERBALIST, THE ALCHEMIST, and THE ENCHANTER. The details of each set are listed further down.\nDivination is the process of finding meaning in symbols or patterns, and similarly the act of reading tarot is finding patterns, meaning and visions in the symbols. A larger picture is created when a story is formed from how one card interacts with the next, as a bouquet is created from the harmony between many flowers.\nBOTANICA can be read in many ways, depending on what you\u2019d like to get out of it. To start, you\u2019ll want to familiarize yourself with the deck. Light a candle, play some evocative music, and think about how you respond to the cards you\u2019ve drawn. Without looking at the meanings, what\u2019s the first card that really resonates with you? What plant strikes a chord in you on first sight? \n After you know the deck a bit better, it\u2019s ready for use. Plants have always been a foundational part of how we treat our bodies, and Tarot can be a tool to help sort our thoughts. Consider drawing a card in the morning to guide you throughout the day. Ponder a question and draw three cards to meditate on the foundation of a problem, what it looks like currently, and how to handle it in the future. Or lay out a full ten-card spread and really get to the root of it all. \nHere is a small sampling of the cards included in the deck, with notes from their creator.\n\n\nTHE LOVERS represents emotional decisions and the union between independent and equal partners. I chose peonies because they have flamboyant blooms that are \"perfect flowers\" -- a botanical term for flowers with both reproductive parts --  and for the generosity they exhibit in their symbiotic relationship with ants. I think it\u2019s important for modern decks to capture the essence of The Lovers, and for me it\u2019s about people being their whole selves and sharing that with others, the way peonies share their dew with ants and are protected from predators in turn.\n Like the floating seeds of a dandelion, THE FOOL sets out on their journey full of hope and with the promise of new growth. It\u2019s a common plant, almost ubiquitous, and carries with it a naive quality I find appealing - I love the idea of making a wish by blowing on its seeds.\nTarot is sometimes described as the journey of the Fool through the deck. That\u2019s why I picked a weed that could weather all of that and still come out on the other side with a feeling of charm and whimsy to be the major symbol of Botanica.\nTHE SEVEN OF WANDS is represented by Datura, or Thorn Apple -- a highly poisonous species of flowering shrubs pollinated by bats. I picked it for this card because the Seven of Wands is about being ready for a battle and having the endurance to see it through, and the fruit of datura reputedly have the ability to heal wounds as much as they can cause harm.\nI picked Japanese vajra (a Buddhist ritual object) for the wands because they\u2019re a symbol of enlightenment that embodies the balance between the five poisons to one\u2019s purity and the five wisdoms that help one attain it.\n\nTHE FOUR OF COINS is a card is about being trapped by comfort. Honeysuckle bears flowers with a sweet aroma that wafts through the summer air, attracting all manner of creatures. It can be an extremely invasive species, and in those cases its vines can take over native plants and literally choke them. The Four of Coins is a warning to avoid excess, to take time to smell the flowers.\nThe coin symbol I picked for this card is wampum, a beaded Native American currency, as the Common Honeysuckle is a species native to the eastern coast of North America. The shells of this protocurrency were harvested off the coast and prized as much for their value as decoration. Their beautiful swirls of purple and white were often woven into belts by tribes like the Iroquois.\n Here are the  three editions in which we're publishing BOTANICA.\n\nThe standard BOTANICA deck will include all 78 cards, and a booklet explaining the symbolic meaning of each card and each plant. Each deck comes in a sturdy tuckbox, blocked with gold foil.  Everything you need to read fortunes in the flowers.\n ***SOLD OUT***\nTHE ALCHEMIST is a collectible version of BOTANICA, limited to an edition of two hundred fifty. This edition is housed in an elaborately embossed tin with antique brass finishing, wrapped in the embroidered silk altar cloth. Each copy is signed and hand-numbered by the artist Kevin Jay Stanton. You will be thanked by name in the informational booklet that accompanies the deck.\nTHE ALTAR CLOTH\nThe ALCHEMIST, DARK ALCHEMIST and ENCHANTER editions include a 24x24\" silk altar cloth to be used for readings (or as a stylish neckerchief). In addition to being a beautiful way to encase your deck, each cloth is embroidered with symbols of the Arcana and imbued with the wishfulness and tenacity of dandelions.\nTHE COMPENDIUM\nThe ALCHEMIST, DARK ALCHEMIST, ENCHANTER and HERBALIST AND COMPENDIUM tiers will come with a a compendium detailing the research, process art and theory that went into the creation of BOTANICA.

Between our various ventures, we have raised nearly a million dollars on Kickstarter, and rewarded backers of every campaign with many beautiful books and other rewards.\n\nWe've carefully priced out expenses for domestic and overseas shipping, as well as printing costs for all rewards. We\u2019ve arranged for the logistics of reward fulfillment. We know exactly how much money and how much work are required to get this project across the finish line. All we need is the funding necessary to finish the job. To be honest, our biggest risk is that in these turbulent times people won't have the funds to spend on art projects like these.\n\nStill, there are more risks and challenges involved in making things with such high production values than I can realistically list here. Don't believe anybody who tells you this stuff is easy. Problems can and will pop up in ways we can't predict. (For instance, despite our considerable epidemiological expertise, we didn't see this global pandemic coming.) But our team has the knowledge, experience and commitment to persevere through difficulties and deliver a product that meets and exceeds the exacting expectations of our audience of discerning readers and collectors.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "A BLESSING", "descp": "We will speak your name aloud amidst a field of wildflowers, and you will be botanically blessed.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2020"}], "stat": ["49 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "A GLIMPSE", "descp": "You will receive a digital PDF containing images of all 78 cards, and the booklet explaining their symbolism.\nINCLUDES:\nDIGITAL ACCESS", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2020"}], "stat": ["235 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 15 or more", "title": "THE DANDELION", "descp": "A 1\" hard enamel dandelion pin designed by Kevin Jay Stanton.

Shipping is really expensive and we have tried to come up with pricing that accurately reflects our cost to get the game into your hands without creating a logistical nightmare on our side.  Your shipping will be added in the pledge manager.  We expect that we'll have to come out of pocket a bit based on what we are charging and we are ok with that.\nTracking: We will also be using non-trackable shipments in some cases in order to save on cost as tracking can add 30-50% or more in some cases. So please understand if we do not have tracking with your package we did so knowingly. Rest assured, that we will get you your game and any risk associated with a package not being trackable is on us.\nDelivery time: While we would love to get everyone their games at the same time, it is just not possible. There is a high likelihood that some areas of the world will get their games before others. Our commitment is to get the games ready and printed as fast as possible (we've already done a ton of the prep work). At the factory we will break out the shipments to each fulfillment company with instructions to them that they should begin shipping as soon as possible upon receipt. In addition, because we have complete control over the U.S. shipments, you will not be able to order and receive the game on Amazon (or from any other US retailer) before our backers have it.   (Please note: Because of unexpected delays and other unforseen issues, we reserve the right to sell the game at major conventions, even if they have not been delivered yet).  The reason for this is that conventions are among the best form of marketing and therefore necessary to give the game the best chance for success.  One guarantee we will give is that if we do release the KS exclusive version anywhere before the backers receive theirs it will be at a price that is higher (usually significantly) than what was offered in the campaign.\n\nCharity information:\n* We will be donating up to $15,000 to Direct Relief.  \nPer Kickstarter rules, no money collected for this campaign will go towards any donations.  All proceeds for charity will be donated from our own funds outside this campaign.  The charity we are donating to is Direct Relief.  Direct Relief works in the U.S. and internationally to equip doctors and nurses with life-saving medical resources to care for the world's most vulnerable people.  We chose them due to their stellar rating with Charity Navigator and for the specific work they do, especially in this current crisis affecting every corner of the world.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs a publisher that has brought more than a dozen games to market thus far, we feel confident in our ability to get this done. The gameplay for this game is 95% complete. The art and graphics are well underway.

In addition, our intention is to not release this game to standard retail until all U.S backers orders have been shipped.

We use centrifugal distribution on a flat surface with bearings that abstract the result at two levels (While the spinner spins at one speed, the bearings turn inside the channel at another, varying speed). It\u2019s a similar mechanism as what Wheel of Fortune uses to more or less \u201cguarantee\u201d balance. But truthfully, there is no perfect system. We would certainly be confident in saying this is as balanced a result as rolling a high-end balanced die.\nQ: What about the sequential numbers?\nA: We've changed it! Given the ongoing and vehement response to this particular feature - we've been able to change and interleave the numbers so that they're non-sequential and always in opposing quadrants.  All backers will receive interleaved numbers.\nIt was a really strange month: October 2019. One of my friends had been laid off the week prior, and I was to take over his old office. Sitting there, eating a fibreOne bar he'd so graciously left behind in his desk, my friend David entered the room and together we assessed the rest of the valuables (beyond the box of fibreOnes, obviously) scattered about. \nThat's when we saw it. A magic eight ball. It made us consider randomness. It made us wonder about probability. It made us ponder whether we needed to pursue other things before being fired ourselves. And when we asked if we should fully chase whatever dumb idea we had next, the eight-ball responded \"It is decidedly so.\"\nAnd so here we are on Kickstarter, with, you know, all the wisdom of a magic eight-ball, having fully convinced ourselves that this next dumb idea would be the dumb idea to help us break free. \nIt is thus with a \"spin of the dice\" (to coin a new term)..., and after much planning, prototyping and months of play-testing, that we present our not-quite-as-dumb-as-we -might-once-have-thought idea:  \nBecause when you don't want to lose dice, it's best to not use them at all. \ud83d\ude1c The red indicator bearing points to the roll result.\nFront view of the Mythroll 4:6/8:12 with the indicator pointing to the 6 on the upper row or 12 on the lower row.\nOn our 4:8/6:12 Model, half of the spinner shows a d4 and a d8, and the other half shows a d6 and a d12. The two red indicator bearings guarantees each half of the spinner always has an indicator when spun..\nWe have two objectives with this campaign.\n1. To build a community of alternative rollers; or \"Mythrollers\" as we call them. Defined as \"a group of people who share a boundless perspective on randomness and number rolling - and are unsatisfied with the polyhedral prisons they've been confined to.\" Dramatic? Yes. Exactly. \n2. To bring this unique idea to market with the help of said Mythrollers. \n We've been designing, prototyping, game-testing and prepping for manufacture for approximately 6 months now - and the final build of the first two models are currently in production. \nHere's a bit of the process we've been through...\nThe original, October 3rd/2019 3D-rendered design of, what was at the time, called \"The Scroller\". \ud83d\ude02\nNovember 2019: Let's call this time period \"the exasperation\".\nDuring the month of November 2019 (or what we like to call \"The Exasperation\"), the debacle which was \"electroplating\" the numbers onto a conical steel item, caused our team in China to have to create over 25 unique iterations to get it right. This process... sucked. We had to design and implement a new technique to electroplate the numbers and lines in a multi-step process. But, we're now the proprietors of a new electroplating technique! Yay!\nWe were excited to put a video together to discuss our process a bit.\nEach Mythroll Armory Spinner will be delivered in a delightfully logo-adorned, perfectly-shaped black box for safekeeping.\n We need the Kickstarter community for a few MAJOR reasons: \n1. Creating prototypes of this type costs approximately $250 per unit. We have a number of variations in the design phase. However, these variations cannot be created and brought to market without the funds provided by the Kickstarter community.  \n2. Pre-orders will allow us to build a multitude of finishes and colours available for purchase DURING the kickstarter. We'll also be able to unlock a custom two-wide zip case (Pictured below).\n3. To keep the costs of manufacturing low, we need to order several hundred spinners of each model at a time. That can't happen without the Kickstarter community supporting the project. \n4. We'd also love to push the manufacturing process along to build a d20 Spinner (rendering animation below). \n5. One of our goals is to become an Amazon FBA store so that, when someone wants a spinner, they can get it shipped to their home overnight. We cannot accomplish this without the support of the Kickstarter community. Once backers DO help us reach our goals - our new online Spinners Amazon FBA store will be available to all! \nCustom Mythroll Spinner Dual-Case holder unlocked! It may not be exactly as pictured.\nIndividuals backing multiple pairs will receive one custom character pad per spinner pair.\nWe were going to put a picture of the boring dice you can receive for your pledge of $10, but we figured no one wanted to see them anyways.\n Upon the successful completion of the Kickstarter we really want to make the spinners available on Amazon Prime in both Canada and the United States. Doing so will allow us to ship with prime delivery, but the price will go up to a minimum of $62.95 USD  per unit to account for the costs associated with the convenience of Amazon Prime (labelling and inventory management) and Amazon's large cut (15% in the games hardware category). Do not wait to pledge! \n Lock in your 47% (minimum!) savings by pledging during the Kickstarter now (before the retail prices kick in AFTER the Kickstarter)!

Export beautiful tokens in a wide range of styles.\nAt the conclusion of our Kickstarter campaign, your support will immediately go to work helping us deliver these full-featured color tools while continuing regularly to expand the library of parts and customization options on www.heroforge.com.\nFebruary 2020: We begin updating our library of thousands of parts for color compatibility. \nMay 2020: Finalized user interface for color application, and the launch of beta access to color tools for all Kickstarter backers, and launch Token Maker Unlimited. \nJune 2020: We will open order submission to Kickstarter backer for both 3D printed color and hand-painted color custom miniatures. While we ultimately expect to reach our typical fulfillment speeds, note that orders placed during this closed beta may take several months for fulfillment as we ramp up capacity. Fulfillment will be gradual, as we work through orders in the order they are received. \nThis timeline is our best estimate, but we will open submissions and start shipping orders as early as possible. Note that, in the case of high order volume, order submission for both hand-painted and 3D printed color miniatures may be made available in stages, with priority based on time of the pledge. Backer reward redemption will be facilitated by digital voucher codes redeemable on www.heroforge.com.\nWe have been developing exciting new tools to fully utilize the most revolutionary 3D printing technology and hardware. It is a big job, but who better to do it than the makers of the original 3D printed custom miniatures?\nHigh-Quality Web-Based Rendering\nWhether you want to fully paint your design with a couple of clicks or hand-tune unique digital 'paints' to capture your character's aesthetic perfectly, we have you covered.\nWe wanted users to be able to do more than apply flat colors, so we looked to traditional, real-world painting techniques to inform our designs. Our rendering and UI has re-imagined classic techniques for the digital world. Replicate the beautiful subtlety of dry brushing, ink-washing's ability to add depth, and much more. Printed designs will include subtle shading and lighting within the color texture, making details pop and adding fantastic realism to your design.\n\nBy giving you the option to hand-tune highlights, low-lights, shininess, hue shift and more, we will give you unparalleled design tools and let you see a whole new spectrum of possibilities.\nCutting Edge Manufacturing Technology\n3D printing has evolved at incredible speeds, with new technologies emerging all the time. We're happy to say that this thrilling new print technology means that highly detailed, color printed tabletop minis are finally possible! \nHigh-tech, full-color 3D printers turn pixels on the screen into atoms in your hand!\nColor is produced by mixing a range of color materials on the fly, allowing for full, vivid CMYK prints with beautiful gradients and detail. This technology employs dissolvable support materials, removing the need for support sprues and allowing for smoother, more consistent surfaces than ever before.\nThis plastic is similar in durability to our premium plastic material. Faint layer lines may be visible on the surface of the figures, especially in strong direct light.\nOne-Click Color Schemes \nNo need to have an art degree or knowledge of color theory to have fun coloring your character. You will be able to quickly paint your character in seconds, using a wide range of artist-designed color motif presets so you can \u201ctry on\u201d a wide range of color schemes or use them as a jumping-off point for your own design.\nA Multitude of Digital Paint Options\nWe'll offer a library of artist-tuned paint options for a wide range of materials. Experience the coloring-book joy of turning a character from grayscale to full, rich color quickly and easily!\n We'll also offer the ability to \"mix your own paint.\" Customize more than just the color: adjust shininess, highlight, mid-light, and low-light tones, and more. Your hand-crafted digital 'paints' will be saved with your character, allowing you to revisit and tweak them to your heart's content.\nTons of artistically tuned options for every material, all at your disposal!\nFive years ago, Kickstarter's support allowed us to launch revolutionary web-based design tools for custom miniatures. Since then, we\u2019ve shipped hundreds of thousands of miniatures to dozens of countries around the world. We've continued to work tirelessly, adding content and working with the world-leading 3D printing service providers to deliver the latest and greatest technology--and the best custom miniatures on the market.\n\nSince our launch, we've expanded our tools and customization options. We've added over a thousand new parts, two dozen new fantasy races, and ever-improving materials in both plastic and metal. In 2019, we began adding fresh content every single week. \nTens of thousands of users have visited every \"Treasure Tuesday\" to see what we\u2019ve added from our ever-growing \u2018user wish-list\u2019 of content requests. And we're certainly not done yet! You'll even find several sneak-peeks at upcoming parts sprinkled throughout this very Kickstarter! We continue to develop new models for the site, prioritizing the most commonly requested additions. \nHero Forge adds new content every single week on what we call \"Treasure Tuesdays!\"\nWhy Kickstarter? \nKickstarter has been an incredible tool to help us connect with tabletop and miniatures fans. This direct connection has helped us work with our most passionate supporters and offers an avenue to hear about what features and content you'd like to see added. Your backing will help us in the process of updating our library of thousands of parts to support rich, in-depth color customization, and launch exciting feature additions sooner.\nThe Future of Hero Forge\n\n                       Hero Forge 2.0 will expand and enhance the design capabilities that Hero Forge is famous for. You can expect us to continue our tradition of innovation, setting the bar for customization and artistry for custom miniatures. \nPreview just a few of our planned additions and advancements in the hero featured in our splash image: XL epic wings, dynamic and detailed bases, magical weapon effects, and cute new companions represent just some of the exciting new features we have planned, so even more people can design their perfect miniature. With your support, we can add this new content even faster, and with the new Hero Forge 2.0 color tools in mind.\nHero Forge 2.0 is the platform for the future of 3D printed custom miniatures. Design and print the most epic of characters, not only in stunning detail, but in gorgeous full color.\nBacker rewards include early or permanent access to a range of new features and tools on www.heroforge.com.\nEarly Access to Color Tools\nBe among the first to start designing in color! Backer tiers starting at $34.99 will be given early access to our color design tools. Watch our UI and tools develop before your very eyes!\n\nThe First Opportunity to Order Custom Miniatures in Color\nWe are employing cutting edge technology to bring full-color custom miniatures to you. Backers will be first in line to have figures printed in this exciting new material as we scale up production.\nEarly and Permanent Access to New 'Token Tools'\nOur token tools and new photo booth options will add a range of easy-to-use image capture features to Hero Forge. While we intend to one day add a range of pro-tools to a Hero Forge subscription services, Kickstarter backers will get access to the Token Maker Unlimited with no recurring subscription fees, receiving either a full year of access at lower tiers, or lifetime access at higher backer tiers!\n...and Much More!\nWant to offer even more support?

Your support will help us deliver them even sooner! Read on to hear about the first batch of six stretch goals, with more to be announced once these are met soon!\n\nWe're so excited about these last remaining stretch goals. We can't wait to see how many you will help us unlock during these final days of the Hero Forge 2.0 campaign!\nSky Castle Studios, LLC is a Santa Monica-based development studio dedicated to using gaming and technology to inspire creativity and connect people. Established in 2014 after the runaway-hit Hero Forge crowdfunding campaign, we continue to grow our cutting-edge web-based design application and explore the latest in 3D printing manufacturing. \nSpecial thanks to Fantasy Grounds for letting us feature screen captures of their virtual tabletop program, Kraken Dice for providing the dice featured in our photography, Izzy Gramp for color design, and Kate Elliot at www.kvephotography.com for editing our Kickstarter video.\nWe are lucky to work with incredibly talented artists all over the world, and would like to thank them for their contributions to Hero Forge. In particular, for their creativity and dedication, we would like to thank Glenn De Leon Garza, Ilya Bondarenko, Roman and Vadim at ZugZug Art, and Rich Carey.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nQ: Will reaching your funding goal distract you from adding new content? Color is great, but I want more stuff on Hero Forge too!\nA: Our modelers\u2019 time and effort will still be dedicated to new content, parts, fantasy races, and features, even as our tech development team works on color at the same time. With independent, focused effort by our art team, we anticipate accelerating additions to the site, even as we add our new color features.\n\nQ: Will I be able to redeem my reward for an \"XL\" or mounted \"XXL\" figure?\nA: For simplicity, we have set rewards for our standard size-range, unmounted figures. If you prefer to redeem your reward's value towards a more expensive XL or mounted figure, that's alright: we will apply your pledge value and you can pay the difference. Pricing on larger-sized XL and XXL figures is TBD.\n\nQ: I saw a part or feature in your video which isn't on your site yet! What's the story?\nA: We have new parts, features, and content in development constantly. In order to keep up with weekly content releases, our art team works diligently on future releases, both those near completion and ones much further away. If you don't recognize any particular parts on this page, chances are they are in development and will appear on the site in the future!\n\nQ: When are you going to add X part? Will Y feature be available when color launches?\nA: We process all feature and part requests through the following survey, so please feel free to fill it out to have your request added to our official user wish-list: https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/HeroForgeRequest. Our user request wishlist has many hundreds of unique entries, so we cannot provide estimated dates for specific additions.\n\nQ: Will Hero Forge 2.0 be backwards compatible?\nA: Yes! All of your existing characters and saves will be fully compatible with our new tools. You will be able to revisit old designs and add color.\n\nQ: Will digital download .stl files be available in color?\nA: No. Not initially, at least. File formats which support color are less widely supported by 3D printing software platforms, as color is not yet common for home 3D printers. While we expect to one day offer textured, color 3D model files, for the time being we will continue to distribute digital download model files in .stl format: the most commonly supported format for 3D printing software platforms.\n\nQ: What Printer are you using for your color prints?\nA: We plan to manufacture full color prints using the Mimaki 3DUJ-553 full color printer. We have experimented with a wide range of color printers, and have found this technology to offer the most vivid color, cleanest gradients, and best quality at miniature scale. At Hero Forge, we are always exploring the latest and greatest materials, and have historically added to or updating our material options as 3D print technology improves--this is always a possibility for the future.\n\nQ: Do I have to use all my rewards at once, or can I order figures one at a time?\nA: Backer tiers include one instance of shipping. If you'd prefer to redeem your backer rewards one at a time, you will simply need to pay for any instance of shipping after the first.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 39 or more", "title": "1x 3D Printed Color Mini", "descp": "Receive Kickstarter-exclusive pricing on a full-color, 3D printed tabletop miniature!\nINCLUDES:\nCustom FULL-COLOR 3D PRINTED miniature\nGet early access to full color design tools\nGet access to Kickstarter Backer-Exclusive \"decal\"\nBe added to our mailing list and receive exclusive-mail updates", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["17,577 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 39 or more", "title": "1 Year Access to Token Maker Unlimited", "descp": "Get a full year of access to the new Token Maker.\nINCLUDES:\nGet early access to full color design tools\nReceive 1-year access to the Token Maker Unlimited\nGet access to Kickstarter Backer-Exclusive \"decal\"\nBe added to our mailing list and receive exclusive-mail updates", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2020"}], "stat": ["834 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 50 or more", "title": "Print and Paint Yourself", "descp": "Receive special Kickstarter-exclusive pricing on 10 digital download .stl files for 3D printed tabletop miniatures!

The act of a scheduled activity where I would go have fun with friends on a regular basis helped me overcome my depression. It helped me build stronger connections with friends, create a sense of community, and, as cheesy as it sounds, gave me somewhere to belong. As a way to contribute back to the fandom creatively, I started Dispel Dice. \nSince then, it\u2019s grown more than I could have possibly imagined in a short period of time. I want to share Dispel Dice with the world, and to do that, I need to accelerate production so it can be sustainable long-term.\nDispel Dice stands in solidarity with Kickstarter United.\n\nWe've unlocked all the designs now!

VAT TAXES, IMPORT FEES, CUSTOMS FEES, & DUTIES ARE NOT INCLUDED.\nHow we do it!\nEvery artisan set is hand poured, polished, and painted, so there may be slight imperfections or differences of color and material suspension in the dice. No part of this process is automated. Please understand that due to the nature of how they're crafted, it is impossible to ensure they're absolutely perfect or identical because each one is one of a kind.\nI am the sole full-time staff member of Dispel Dice at the moment, but I did not do this alone. I have an amazing support network that came together to help me bring this project to life. This absolutely would not be possible without their combined experience and contributions.\nEveryone on this list (along with some people who asked to be left off of it) has touched my life in so many ways -- from a friend who crowdfunded and organized a meal delivery service to feed me while I worked during the final stretch of this project, to the long hours my father and I spent learning every nook and cranny of the manufacturing process together to ensure a quality product. He's been in manufacturing and quality control for over 25 years, so it's been a real joy to learn from him first hand. I can't thank my father and my mother enough for their support during this adventure!\nThere are those at the resin & plastics shops -- Kyle, Ricky, Glenn, Sasha, Charlie -- who contributed their time towards educating me about resin casting in the first place. There's Chris and Jessie Do, who have inspired and mentored me. They planted the seeds that gave me the confidence I needed to start this business.\nI can't leave out my friends Katy and Trevor, who packed orders tirelessly while I worked. And don't even get me started on Susan. She encouraged me for months to start making dice, and went above and beyond by taking time out of her busy schedule to answer emails and questions while I was setting everything up for the launch. There's also my DM, who created awe-inspiring content, as well as my friend Derek, who set up my first game. He persisted in inviting me to get out of my comfort zone and try something new, and it changed my life.\nThe list could go on forever. Each of the people I\u2019ve named has helped me during this long and winding journey, but there are so many more who have left kind comments, sent supportive messages, or encouraged me along the way.\nThis section is for you.\nIt\u2019s not enough, but I just want to take a moment to thank everyone that contributed, listened, gave advice or moral support. Although I\u2019m happy with what I\u2019ve done up to this point, I can\u2019t take all the credit for the incredible work that would have been impossible without the contributions of my family and friends; I\u2019m so proud of them and everything they\u2019ve accomplished. Thank you all for being part of this project!\n\n\nWe stand in solidarity with those at Kickstarter United, and support voluntary union recognition. Thank you for your hard work, because this platform for creators and those that support them, would not exist without you and your contributions. \nDAY 1 PLEDGES ARE NOW OVER!\nUPDATE: Day 1 Pledges Bonuses have now ended!

If you pledge 3 sets or MORE, you will receive the Merlot D20. \nDespite what you may read about the dice on the internet, they are in fact, inedible.\nThe edges on these dice are sharp -- especially the D4. These dice are not meant for children or to be ingested. Please keep them away from pets, children, feet and mouths. Failure to do so could result in injury or death. \nPlease.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI make multiple sets of dice almost every single day, so I\u2019ve personally encountered many of the issues that will crop up during the manufacturing process. You can see all of my experiments over the past several months on my Twitter or Instagram pages. I have purposefully selected these designs for their stability, so you can be sure that I\u2019ve done my research.\n\nI\u2019ve personally taught the crafters at my facilities how to pour the sets properly, step by step, so everyone involved is using the same process and materials that I\u2019ve been using in my one-person operation since Dispel Dice\u2019s inception. In addition to that, if this project funds, I will be pouring alongside them so that we can continue to make this process more efficient.\n\nWe\u2019ve spent months speaking and training our two facilities to ensure that they\u2019re able to produce a quality product. We will be sourcing a third as well. As with any production or manufacturing process, there may be unforeseen risks or complications, but we\u2019ve done our best due diligence to get ahead of all of them.\n\nIn the interest of transparency, here's where we are:\n\nWe\u2019re able to produce sharp edges stably and efficiently. The dice are beautiful (just look!). The suspension is evenly dispersed. They\u2019re able to match my sample colors almost perfectly every time, though there may be very slight variances between batches.\n\nDue to the fact that they are handmade, there may be small flaws or quirks on the dice or in the number wells. Examples include a tiny hole in some of the number wells (which is painted over), and slight bubbling of the paint in the numbers -- specifically the smaller ones. The painting isn't always perfect on everything, but I will be working closely with the facilities to improve the quality. Nevertheless, I ask for your understanding that there may be a slight difference in the metallic sheen and thickness of the paint on the final products. \n\nLast, but not least, I want to point out that I have already placed batch orders from the facilities and tested their ability to produce quality sets in moderate quantities ahead of this launch. We've been working with them to develop this process for 8 months now. Instead of launching as early as possible, I really wanted to iron out as many kinks as I could ahead of time.

I would love for you to join me live for this last hour and celebrate what we have achieved!\nYou are citizens of Squall's End on a rescue mission to The Isle of Cats and must rescue as many cats as possible before the evil Lord Vesh arrives. Each cat is represented by a unique tile and belongs to a family, you must find a way to make them all fit on your boat while keeping families together.\nYou will need to manage resources as you draft cards to explore the island, rescue cats, find treasures, befriend Oshax and read ancient lessons. Each lesson you collect will give you another personal way of scoring points, in addition to filling your boat and keeping cat families together!\nTo expand the base game, we are offering a 5 & 6 player expansion adding more lesson cards, cats, treasures and 2 extra boats to the game. Not only does this expansion add support for 2 extra players, but it also adds more variety and options to the base game extending the replayability offered by the game. \n\nThe Isle of Cats is played over 5 days (rounds). On each day the cats will venture into the fields on the island and you have until nightfall to attempt to rescue them through 5 phases of play.\nEach player gains 20 fish.\nEach player is dealt 7 discovery cards, they choose and keep 2, passing the remaining cards to the player to their left. They repeat this process 4 times, but the last time they will only keep 1 card.\nYou will then look at your 7 cards to decide which to add to your hand. The cost is in the top left corner of every card, and if you wish to keep a card, it must be paid for in fish.\nYou can keep as many cards as you like!\nEvery lesson card you kept must be placed face down on the table. Lesson cards are personal objectives allowing you to score extra points at the end of the game.\nNow players take it in turns to rescue cats, each cat requires a basket and a number of fish. Keep going around the table until everyone has run out of baskets, fish, or passes.\nWhen you rescue a cat, you must immediately place it on your boat, the first cat can go anywhere, but after that every cat must touch at least 1 previously played tile.\nYou will need to find a balance between how many cards you keep in the explore stage, and how many cats you wish to rescue in the rescue phase.\nFinally, players will take it in turns to play Oshax and Treasure cards. Treasures offer smaller pieces to fill those tricky areas, and the Oshax are friendly cats that can act as any colour, they just want to have a friend!\nAfter 5 days, you will earn points for completed lesson cards, rare treasures and families of cats (groups of touching cats of the same colour) on your boat. \nHowever, you will lose points for each room on your boat which isn\u2019t filled and any rats which haven\u2019t been eaten!\n\nThe winner is the player with the most points at the end of the game!\nYou can download the rulebook here.\n\nThe Isle of Cats family mode provides a beginner friendly, gateway game which can be played by anyone new to the board game hobby, and children. It removes a lot of the complexity included within the standard game and simplifies the setup, learning curve, and decisions players have to make. \nIt also makes the perfect introductory game, as once you are comfortable with the family mode and are ready for something more challenging, you will already know some of the rules for the standard game. \n You can download the rulebook here.\n\n\n\nThe Isle of Cats solo mode has been designed to provide players with a similar experience to the multiplayer game. You won\u2019t be competing to get the best score possible, but instead you will be faced against your sister! Somehow, she managed to sneak aboard your boat and she is trying to claim credit for everything you have done, it\u2019s going to be a tough week!\nIn the solo mode you will be playing the game in the exact way you would play the multiplayer game, but through a few extra cards and minimal management, you will find yourself competing against a challenging opponent. The solo game includes multiple difficulties allowing you to progress as you get better and is a great way to learn the game before playing with other people.\nYou can download the rulebook here, the solo rules start on page 18.\nIf you would like to read a written preview of The Isle of Cats, then Zatu Games has you covered!\nIf you would like to help spread the word during our campaign then feel free to download and use our avatars anywhere you like. \nWe have also put together a fan and media kit containing some high resolution photos and artwork which you are welcome to use on your website, social media or anywhere else you choose.\nElla, Yanna, and Kuma are the inspiration behind The Isle of Cats and lead models.\nFrank West is the designer of The Isle of Cats, he is also the worldbuilder for The City of Kings, art director, and graphic designer.\nDragolisco is the lead artist for The Isle of Cats, creating nearly all of the beautiful pieces of art you will see whilst exploring The Isle of Cats.\nSara Jorge is the Assistant Producer of The Isle of Cats and has helped create prototypes, organise playtests, and assisted with design concepts.\nIan O'Reilly is the primary writer assisting Frank with writing the back stories for The Isle of Cats.\nAlec Jackson created our visual identity and brand, helping to guide our graphic design.\nWally is our account manager at Whatz Games who are manufacturing the game.\nAll shipping is EU, America, Canada, Australia, and Brazil friendly, so no custom fees will be charged for these locations. We will also do everything we can to keep our UK shipping friendly whatever the outcome of Brexit.\n** Shipping to Brazil is sent as part of a bulk shipment to a warehouse, removing custom fees. However, this does add 2 months to the shipping period.\nUnfortunately we can no longer ship to Russia. If this should change I will let you know.\n Additional copies of the game\nYou may add additional copies of the game and/or expansion to your pledge, and will receive a \u00a35 discount for every extra copy after your first. To do this, please manually increase your pledge to include the extra funds, and if you are outside of the US/UK please make sure you include shipping.

My last Kickstarter, The City of Kings included multiple expansions, custom 3D accessories and was a very big boxed game.

I have allowed time in our delivery schedule to manage this.\n\nMANUFACTURING\nWe will once again be working with Whatz Games who did a fantastic job for us in printing The City of Kings, World Packs and Vadoran Gardens, I am extremely confident in their ability to manufacture this game.\n\nSHIPPING\nOur importing and fulfilment process went very well during our last project, delivering games to all regions within a few weeks of each other.

This is the Kickstarter page for A Lie Agreed Upon: The Deadwood Chronicles, a book about the making of David Milch's classic HBO series Deadwood, which recently wrapped up its story with a TV movie, 13 years after its traumatic cancellation. \nWHAT WE'RE MAKING: A book about Deadwood that looks like an old Bible, written by me, with an introduction by bestselling novelist Megan Abbott (Dare Me), extensive footnotes, and drawings by Max Dalton that channel dime novels and Charles Dickens illustrations.\nPRINT RUN: 5000\nUNIT PRICE: $30 per copy\nSPECS: 434pp; black-and-white illustrations; faux-leather cover, possibly with gilded pages\nDELIVERY DATE: November, 2020\nFUNDRAISING TARGET: 150K\nThe cover of A LIE AGREED UPON: THE DEADWOOD CHRONICLES\nABOUT ME AND THE BOOK\nI've been writing about Deadwood for 15 years, starting when I was a TV columnist for The Star-Ledger of New Jersey (two set visits, in 2005 and 2006), and continuing at Slant, Salon, and most recently New York magazine (they flew me to the film set in 2018, and it resulted in an exclusive interview with Milch in which he revealed his diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease). \nBut here's the thing: Although I've done numerous books about film and TV--including The Wes Anderson Collection, The Wes Anderson Collection: Grand Budapest Hotel, Mad Men Carousel, TV: The Book, and The Sopranos Sessions--this Deadwood book is something that can't be produced within the commercial system. It's too much of a peculiar, obsessive collector's item/art object. \nAs you can see from the cover mockup, A Lie Agreed Upon will look like a Bible from the early 20th century (it's specifically modeled on my  grandfather's Bible), so that if you read it in public, people will assume you're just refreshing your knowledge of the Gospels. Reverend Smith would approve. \nThe heart of the book is a thoroughly reported history of the series, broken into seven chapters,  plus illustrations, footnotes, an introduction, and an appendix of critical essays on all  the episodes. Here's a detailed breakdown:\nIntroduction. By crime fiction writer Megan Abbott, the bestselling author of Give Me Your Hand, You Will Know Me, and Dare Me, and a staff writer on HBO's The Deuce. Fans of my work will also recognize Megan from her marvelous introduction to Mad Men Carousel. \nChapter 1: Beginnings. David Milch before Deadwood. Covering some of his personal history at Yale, as Robert Penn Warren's assistant, as an acclaimed young writer on Hill Street Blues, as a writer-producer on NYPD Blue and subsequent dramas, then finally pitching a show about Rome to HBO, finding out they already had a show in the works called Rome, and changing his pitch to a Western. \nChapter 2: Pilot. The writing, casting and shooting of the pilot episode. This chapter will include origin stories of the principal cast, Milch's hiring of director Walter Hill, and the creation of the main set at Melody Ranch Studios near Los Angeles. \nChapters 3-5: The Seasons. These chapters will cover the production of seasons 1, 2 and 3, including the addition of new cast members, concerns about falling ratings, controversies over the show's language and violence, and the series' place within the pantheon of early-aughts TV dramas built around antiheroic characters. These chapters will draw on my archive of interviews with principal and secondary actors as well as the cast and crew, including so-called \"below the line\" people who worked in specific craft-oriented jobs and who aren't normally included in a book of this sort. This section ends with the show's shocking cancellation in 2006, and goes into differing accounts of what happened.\nChapter 6: The Wilderness. Wherein Milch tries to get other series going at HBO, with varying degrees of success, including John From Cincinnati (one season), Luck (one season) and Last of the Ninth and The Money (pilot only). Meanwhile, the main cast members move on to other shows, including Justified, starring Timothy Olyphant; House of Cards, costarring Molly Parker, Supernatural, costarring Jim Beaver; American Gods, starring Ian McShane, and Sons of Anarchy, which employed so many former regulars that I've joked was a part of the Deadwood Actors Full Employment Act of 2006.\nChapter 7: The Movie. Self-explanatory. \nAppendix: Recaps. Critical essays on every episode of the show, plus the film. These will certainly contain detailed footnotes on the story; the characters' psychology; the ratio of historical fact to Milch's fiction; Deadwood's kinship to Western movies and literature, the Bible, and Shakespeare; and other fun stuff. Many of these footnotes will be written by me, but there will also be contributions from colleagues who are experts on particular aspects of the show and the history it draws on.\nAs is my policy, the recaps will discuss things that have already happened, but never things that haven't happened yet. That way first-time viewers can use the recap section of A Lie Agreed Upon as a viewing guide.\nAnd now here comes something really cool:\nILLUSTRATIONS\nMax Dalton, an Argentina-based graphic artist and illustrator who did drawings for my Wes Anderson books and Mad Men Carousel, is on board to do a series of original illustrations for this book, based on key incidents in Deadwood. \nThese will be done in a modified version of his signature style, drawing partial inspiration from dime novels and the pen-and-ink caricatures that used to appear in bound editions of novels by Charles Dickens. Here's a rough, early version of a sketch of the shooting of Wild Bill Hickok by the coward Jack McCall. They will appear in the recaps section, always on the page where the event in question is written about, in order to prevent accidental spoilers.\nIllustration by Max Dalton\nWild Bill's Funeral, Illustrated by Max Dalton\n\nUPDATE: We're offering a set of 6 Max Dalton Deadwood drawings as a reward for backers at certain levels. See the Rewards section for details.\nWHAT OUR FUNDRAISER IS FOR\nIt's to pay to make this book. That's it. \nOur expenses are broken into four (4)  sections:\n1. TALENT. This category starts with me, as I'm going to be writing most of the text, and I've already been accumulating material for A Lie Agreed Upon for over a year already, on my own time. (That's not counting all the stuff I've been building up since 2004.) But to do this job right, we will  need to hire a lot of other people, and pay them market rates. On the payroll:\n* A text editor and a project manager (hopefully the same person, though it might end up being two people);\n* A copy editor and a proofreader (maybe the same person, but maybe not; these are related but different skill sets) ;\n* A second interviewer, to handle some of the below-the-line interviews, as well as follow-up conversations and fact checking;\n* A full-time interview transcriber who knows the series and American history thoroughly; we're going to have probably 200 new interviews, in addition to the 50 or so I've already done, and that's a lot of transcription;\n* A historical advisor who will analyze the show's relationship to the historical record, and recommend places to integrate that information into the book;\n* Megan Abbott, for her introduction;\n* Max Dalton, for his illustrations.\nCost: $105K\n2. TRAVEL EXPENSES\nBased on my previous experience doing this sort of book, we're going to have to take a few trips to Los Angeles and other locations (including the real Deadwood in South Dakota), to look through archives, and do in-person interviews with people who prefer not to talk on the phone. It might be me doing the traveling. Or it might be the second interviewer, or the historian. We don't know just yet. We're ballparking a total of six solo trips, though it could be more or less.\nCost: $15K\n3. CREATING AND PRINTING THE BOOK\nWe've priced this out, and the minimum print run that we can accept is 5000 copies, because that would get the cost of each book down to $30, the list price of other books of its type. This estimate includes a small cushion for things to go wrong and have to be redone, because nothing every goes perfectly. We don't want to print fewer copies, because it would make each copy of the book more expensive.  \nCost: $20K\n4. PACKING AND SHIPPING THE BOOK\nWe want to have this book delivered by early fall, 2020, so that it can be a holiday gift for people who ordered it. We've estimated the time to pack and ship 5000 copies at 10 business days, if we have five people each day, all working eight-hour shifts. \nWe also have to rent a storage facility large enough to handle 5000 shrink-wrapped books stacked up on wooden pallets, plus the packers, the tables, and the mailing supplies. Also meals. This is tedious work, and we want to treat folks right. \nThis is the best solution for packing and shipping, financially, because we did a bit of research and realized that if we contract with an independent packing and shipping service, the cost of the book will go up, to probably $45 per unit. Nobody wants that. Better to bite the bullet and get the durn thing done on our own.\nCost: $10K\nWHAT YOU GET IN EXCHANGE FOR A DONATION\n$10 and $20 (Hooplehead and Saddle Bum levels) get you 1 and 2 bars of Soap with a Prize inside, respectively. Frankly, why y'all would just want the soap and not the book and all the other good stuff on here is beyond us. But who are we to judge?\nPackage design by Paula Bonhomme and David Lambert\n$30 (Prospector level) gets you 1 copy of A Lie Agreed Upon, signed. Shipping costs vary depending on where you are in the world. International shipping is pretty darn expensive, but y'all probably knew that already! \n$40. (Schoolmarm level) This level gets you 1 copy of A Lie Agreed Upon plus 2 bars of soap.\n$100 (High Roller level) This level gets you 1 copy of A Lie Agreed Upon, 2 bars of soap, and a set of 6 Deadwood drawings by Max Dalton (different sketches than the ones that will appear in the finished book). The sketches are printed on 80 lb. off-white paper and packed flat to prevent damage.\n$150 (Madam level) 1 copy of A Lie Agreed Upon, 2 bars of soap, a set of Max Dalton drawings, and a copy of a separate, limited-edition Matt Zoller Seitz book, Dreams of Deadwood.  This is a photography portfolio book, full color, 24 pages, landscape style, with original text not featured in A Lie Agreed Upon.  \nCover of DREAMS OF DEADWOOD\n$200. (Saloon-keeper level.) This pledge level includes 2 copies of A Lie Agreed Upon; 1 copy of Dreams of Deadwood; the set of Max Dalton prints; and a complete set of all 4 fragrances of Soap with a Prize inside. \n$275. (Impresario level.) 2 copies of A Lie Agreed Upon, 2 copies of Dreams of Deadwood, the set of Max Dalton illustrations, and 8, count 'em, 8 bars of Soap with a Prize Inside! (Two of every scent.) The 8 soaps are packed in a separate, special old-timey package\u2014an ideal gift for that incorrigibly foulmouthed loved one in your life. By which we mean, they also love Deadwood, not that you should wash their mouths out. \nWe're going to add more pledge levels in the coming days.\nThose of you who have already backed the project will notice that the items you selected are no longer available. That's because we've restructured the levels so that every level up  adds more things, and incorporates everything from all the other levels below that. IF YOU WANT TO SWITCH YOUR PLEDGE to something different, we've been reliably informed that it isn't too hard to do. However, if you want to stick with what you originally signed up for, that's OK with us! \nINTERNATIONAL SHIPPING\nWe have now added International shipping options for some (but not all) of the levels. \nSome of you already backed the project from other countries, in a kind of informal arrangement with me, with the understanding that we'd settle up at the end when the project is fully funded. We can still do it that way, but honestly, it would be much better for the project if you switched your pledge to one of the new categories that has international shipping specified on the pulldown menu. \nThe money you contribute right now towards shipping counts towards meeting our goal. And as you know, every dollar we add to the total increases the chances of this book and all the related stuff actually existing! \nORDERING LOTS OF BOOKS FOR GIFTS OR RESALE\nThis is fine. Just use the \"Pledge Without a Reward\" option and enter multiples of $30 per book, and send me a note saying you're ordering in bulk. I've been told that some folks prefer to do this because they just want a bunch of books and aren't really too interested in the other stuff, and that's fine!  \nHuzzah!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe biggest risk in this project is not knowing whether a sufficiently large audience exists to fund the book at the level we need to get it done. \n\nThere's also the possibility that an even steeper slide into dystopia could slow down production of the book, but if that happens, Kickstarter projects are going to be the least of our worries. \n\nIf we succeed in funding it, it'll be my ninth book as a solo author or part of a writing team, and the 15th commercial book that I will have been intimately involved in at the level of production, design, or conception. \n\nWhat's new is doing it entirely outside of the commercial publishing business. There are a lot of intangibles involved in that, because it's kind of like becoming an independent businessperson after working on projects for various major corporations. The economics of scale, time management, ego wrangling, and logistics are all different, and there are more moving pieces that I have to be personally aware of. \n\nFortunately, the purpose of seeking funding is so that I can pay professionals specializing in particular areas of book-making to handle their part, rather than doing everything myself, which is the road to ruin, generally. Many of the individuals I'd hire to work behind the scenes are folks I've already worked with in the past, on commercially successful books, several of them New York Times bestsellers. \n\nI think we did a smart thing in deciding to make a book for people who ordered the book, then send it to them directly. That means we don't have to spend time or money trying to get it sold on Amazon or in physical bookstores, figuring out how to publicize it so people can locate and purchase it, pouring money into Facebook ad buys, hiring publicity or marketing people to convince bloggers, GoodReads contributors and/or mainstream critics to write about it, and so on. \n\nWe're cutting out every conceivable middleman here and making an art object that will be delivered directly to the people who commissioned it.

This is one of my very favorite episodes of the series because it feels like a summation of the unsentimental but compassionate attitude that David Milch and his actors took towards matters of the flesh and spirit, as well as the different ways that individuals and communities try to make sense of it.--]"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #30", "update_userinfo": "Deadwood book will contain Luck recaps as well", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #29", "update_userinfo": "Interview with Deadwood Coordinator Mike Watson", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #28", "update_userinfo": "History Lesson #1: Deadwood Pilot", "update_content": "The following is a sample of the voluminous notes that our historical researcher, Isaac Napell, has been doing for A Lie Agreed Upon.

It has a big speaker and runs on batteries so you can take outside in the backyard and play with friends. And you can swap the software, making it many different instruments in one portable package!\n\n\nMusic Making For Everyone - easy to play, sounds like nothing else\nImagine a gateway drug for people wanting to get into making beats or electronic music. Imagine something deep enough for studio musicians too.\nYou can play the drums or melodies manually (which is better for playing along with an acoustic instrument), or you can use the left knob to select patterns and change the speed to make dance music or hip hop beats.  \nThe pros will get a kick out of the sonic character. The output is 12 bit and it sounds punchy and crunchy like the early MPC drum machines from the 80s and 90s.\nWant LOFI? You got it.\nLet's start with the basics. This video is a nice and slow walkthrough of how the drums work.\nSpeak together\nMultiple people playing music at the same time is so unique and connecting.  Unlike talking, which has us taking turns with each other, music allows us to speak at the same time. Like running through the forest together.\nBitty had to be loud enough to play outside with friends.\nThe speaker that comes on the Bitty is typically used as a car door panel speaker. And it's made of aluminum, not paper.\nWhat do I get? All the software. Play it for years.\nEvery Bitty comes with ALL of the software and samples we've made. You plug it into your computer with USB, select from a library of sound packs, hit upload and boom, new Bitty!\nWe have sound packs like Theremin Bitty, Techno Bitty, Basement Bitty, Trap Bitty, Lofi Bitty Bitty, Beach Bitty, and more on the way.\nSome people suggested selling different Bitty flavors with the software locked, but that doesn't feel right. We'd rather make a thing with a growing library of sound packs so it's a lasting product that stays fresh for years.\nKeeping it fresh is the same reason we made it AAA battery powered. It won't die on you in 15 minutes two years from now. (And you can get rechargeable AAAs too). It can also be powered over USB if you're in your studio.\nSay less\nNite Mode\nThe Kickstarter run of this version will be Edition 1, each one hand numbered. \nIt has premium rubberized knobs. It comes preloaded with the Midnight Bitty sound pack - think synth sounds like the movie Drive soundtrack with some punchy drums. \nYou can swap the software later just like on any other Bitty.\nEarly prototypes of Nite Mode and regular Bitty (no speaker)\nBitty in the Wild\nHere are three tracks made by Trevor Waldorf, aka Hex Eater, from sounds sampled from the Bitty. He is using multiple layers of Bitty sounds with some additional effects (like the washy echos). \nAnd wow! That punch. \n\nGet nerdy on me\nEach sound pack changes the sounds and the mechanics of the knobs (although they are generally similar so it's not confusing).\nThe sounds you see in the demos are combinations of these things: \nSine / square / saw / triangle waves (it's all there, noise too.) \nSample playback - 16khz samples\nPolyphony - 4 voices is easy, depending on the complexity of the patch, 8-16 voices is possible\nFilters - Low Pass, High Pass, Band Pass, Notch\nPatterns / Arpeggiation\n+more in the works\nIt's a platform\nBitty is based on the Arduino platform. So if you wanted to really get in there, you'll be able to edit the code, or write your own from scratch. In fact any sound software already written for regular Arduinos will work.\nBut you don't have to, it comes playable right out of the box.\nFor teachers and parents: if I were a kid and had the choice between a stock Arduino and another one with batteries, amplifier and speaker, and software...\nPeople making faces\nThank you\nThis project wouldn't have happened without many many people. And until today it ran mostly on debt and gratitude! Thank you to Owen Trueblood and Gavin Lund for Rev 1 and Rev 2 of the boards.\n\nOwen Trueblood hand assembling the Rev 1 of Bitty. Gavin Lund debugging the latest Rev 2.\nThanks to AS220 in Providence, Shawn Wallace specifically for giving Nick the technical skills to start Curious Sound Objects four years ago.\nTim Barrass for writing the Mozzi library. Matthew Seaton and Noah Vawter for their contributions to the Bitty code.\nNoah Feehan and Zach Dunham for their sage advice. Dante Fabiero, Gerard Patawaran, Marcelo Coelho, David Robert, Jeff Lieberman, David Cranor, Dan Paluska, Akito Van Troyer, Erik Sorno, and Ella Rinaldo for their friendship and support. Rex Baker for his counsel and good humor. Kate Balug for being a lovely person, an awesome partner, and a fantastic mom. All the Maker Faire people for setting up such a great opportunity to show fun things to a lot of people.\nAll the fine folks at Industry Lab and Kickstarter. \nWell this is a pleasant surprise and is worth an update to this page! Codechangers backed two Education Packs! They run STEM summer camps for students 8-18 and will incorporate Bitty into their curriculum. How fun will that be! Check them out here. And nice to meet you Jason!\nThe latest set of prototypes were made by MacroFab, a company in Houston, TX. \nAnd they turned out great - sturdy, smooth, and on time. Yes, we considered going overseas to save some money, but we would rather pay more for the peace of mind that we will get a quality product on time. \n\nPlay it", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe're going to work with the same company to make the final ones.\n\nThis plan puts our minds at ease, as they are honest and reliable.\n\nHowever, making thousands of something is a different beast.

With many thousands of play-tests, years of non-stop design, over 100 unique illustrations, and more content than we've ever put into a game before, Oceans is our most ambitious project to date.\nAt the game's start, the only food source is plankton, the foundation of the ocean food web. It populates the beautifully illustrated Reef and Ocean boards, shown here as prototypes: \n(Note the fish tokens you see above are off-the-shelf items we used for testing. The actual tokens will be cardboard for the standard edition and acrylic for the deluxe edition. See below.)\nYour goal is to create and evolve species so they find their niche in the growing ecosystem, by giving them helpful combinations of traits. This is a what a species looks like: \nEach species is defined by its population (the fish tokens above), and its traits (the cards above). Through the game It'll gain and lose traits, and gain and lose population depending on what it can eat, and what can eat it. Despite your best efforts, some species will go extinct! It's natural selection at work. \nBecause you can build species from any combination of traits, thousands of species are possible, and they all interact in their own particular ways as the ecosystem builds. Every game creates a one-of-a-kind world, never to be seen again.   \nMany species will be predators, each bigger than the next, all the way up to the dreaded apex predator. But some will eat in other ways, for example by scavenging on the sea bottom or filter-feeding on plankton. Below are examples of trait art - each a watercolor painting by famed nature artist Catherine Hamilton:\nThen there's a whole other side to the game. It's called The Deep. \nHuge regions of deep ocean are unexplored, and what little we've seen of them can seem like fantasy:\nWe had to put this mysterious world into the game. Hence The Deep.\nThe Deep will contain, at minimum, 50 unique, powerful traits, which dramatically boost the range - and strangeness - of species you can evolve. We commissioned scores of illustrations from a variety of fine artists to make them. Here are examples:   \nThrough unlocked stretch goals, at least 32 additional Deep cards may become permanently added to the game. \nBeyond those, there are also 8 foiled Deep promo cards to unlock. These foiled traits are more aggressive and/or complex than the other cards in the game. \nWith all stretch goals unlocked, you'll get more than 90 unique Deep cards in total. They raise the number of distinct species you can evolve from thousands to about one million.\nEach time you play, there are 2 scenario cards in play (chosen at random at the start of the game from a deck of at least 25). Each creates a major ecosystem-shift when activated, altering the whole game. It's another way the evolutionary timeline changes each play.\nThe standard scenario deck can create about 600 distinct Ocean histories to evolve through, but we're also offering up to 13 more scenario cards as stretch goals. With those added, about 1500 Ocean histories are possible. \nWe've packed all this into rules that are simpler, more intuitive, and easier to teach even than Evolution, which was already known for being easy to teach. Nonetheless you'll find tons of hidden tactics and strategies...under the surface. \nNote: Oceans is mechanically quite different from previous Evolution games. See this update for details.  \n For every pledge level, at the end of the campaign, you'll choose between English, French, Spanish and Italian versions of Oceans in the pledge manager. You can pledge for as many copies as you wish.\n North Star Games will publish the English version\n Funforge will publish the French version. Pour voir cette page en fran\u00e7ais, cliquez ici! \n Schwerkraft-Verlag will publish the German Edition. \n Ediciones MasQueOca will publish the Spanish version.

To read about this campaign in, click here.\nStandard Edition Pledge Level - $45 USD ($5 off MSRP)\nYou get the Oceans Standard Edition and all unlocked stretch goals. \nThe Standard Edition contains:  1 Rulebook, 1 Reference Guide, 2 Player aids, 1 Reef board, 3 Ocean boards (2 small, 1 large), 120 Surface cards (10 of each type), 50-80 Deep cards (1 of each type), 24 Scenario cards, 24 Species boards, 200 cardboard fish with 6 different illustrated designs (see below), 4 Player screens, and 4 Bonus Score tokens. Note exact numbers of some components could change with final game tweaks.\nThe 5-6 player expansion contains 40 additional fish, 2 extra player screens, 2 extra bonus score tokens, and 10 extra species boards.  \nNote: unlike in the prototype pictured above, the final cardboard fish will be illustrated on both sides: \nDeluxe Edition Pledge Level - $70 ($15 off MSRP)\nYou get Oceans' Deluxe Edition and all unlocked stretch goals. The Deluxe Edition improves on the Standard Edition in the following ways:\nIncludes 240 deluxe translucent acrylic fish tokens in addition to the cardboard fish of the standard edition, so you can decide how you want to play. The acrylic fish are more durable, easier to handle, and they refract light beautifully. Our goal is to make them as delicious-looking and as tactile as possible. We'll have done our job if your first instinct is to eat them. Prototype:\nThe final version may look even better, as they'll have smooth, beveled edges.\nIncludes custom-printed, premium food bags for up to 6 players for storing your points, instead of cardboard player screens. They feel super-silky, they have drawstrings, and they help keep your playing area neat and compact. \nIncludes 220 custom Oceans premium matte card sleeves, for sleeving both the core trait cards and The Deep trait cards, plus spares. \nBox Cover Art Painting Pledge Level - $3000\nYou get the Deluxe Edition, all unlocked stretch goals, and Catherine Hamilton's original 12\" x 12\" watercolor painting for the Box Cover. Because the painting is one-of-a-kind, only one backer can pledge this level: \nPledge levels which are no longer available\nThere are a number of pledge levels with backer limits that have been reached, and so are no longer available. To simplify this page, we've removed descriptions of these levels for now. We'll add them back in if any become available again.\nWhatever language you choose for your game, your stretch goals will also come in that language. There are three types of stretch goals: \n Deep Cards: Unlocked Deep traits that will become a permanent part of both the Standard and Deluxe Editions. Each card that isn't unlocked may be available on our website for $2.  \n Foiled Deep Cards: Promo Deep traits that are more aggressive and/or complex than normal Deep traits. After the campaign, each foiled card may be available on our website for $3 if there are any left over. \n Scenario Cards: Promo scenarios that are wackier than the standard scenarios. Some are downright goofy. After the campaign, each scenario card may be available on our website for $1 if there are any left over. \nThe total value of all stretch goals is more than $100.\nYou can order as many of each add-on as you like. Note the non-digital add-ons will add extra shipping cost, which will be charged after the campaign ends in our pledge manager.\nEvolution (English or Italian) - add $40 to your pledge for each English copy, $35 for each Italian copy\nEvolution is an award-winning board game where 2 \u2013 6 players adapt terrestrial species in an ever changing ecosystem with hungry predators and limited resources.

Over the past decade, our library of gateway and filler games have entertained, inspired, and provided an opportunity to make memories around the game table, and it all started with our flagship title, Tsuro: The Game of the Path.  We couldn\u2019t think of a better way to celebrate this 10 year milestone than by returning to the series that started it all - so we welcome you to the launch of a brand new Tsuro game!\nLong ago, a vengeful god stole the stars from the night sky. To illuminate the night, brave people released glowing paper lanterns toward the heavens. This act of hope summoned clever magical phoenixes, who soared through the sky and raced toward the lanterns. \nAs the birds flew from lantern to lantern, their enchanted touch transformed the lanterns into brilliant new stars! Before the people's very eyes, the night sky became illuminated with beauty, all because of the firebirds.  The phoenix that creates a constellation of seven new stars will illuminate the night sky and once again restore balance to Tsuro...the path of life! \nIn Tsuro: Phoenix Rising, an exhilarating new entry in the classic Tsuro series, each player is a phoenix, soaring across the board in an effort to reach glowing lanterns and transform them into new stars in the night sky.  The first player to collect seven star tokens wins the game!\nTsuro: Phoenix Rising builds upon the foundation of classic Tsuro \u2013 you must play tiles to extend your path, traverse the board, and be aware of your surroundings \u2013 but it adds exciting new features such as double-sided path tiles that allow for diagonal movement and can be flipped and rotated to choose your destination, as well as a revolutionary new molded board.  As a phoenix, you also have the astounding ability to rise from the ashes and return to the board once per game! \nAll New Gameplay! \u2013 Become a phoenix!  Soar across the board, flipping and rotating the double-sided tiles to build your path on the revolutionary new modular board.\nNew Twist on classic Tsuro \u2013 Builds upon the foundation of Tsuro \u2013 create your path, stay on the board \u2013 but introduces exciting new elements such as set collection, strategic board manipulation\u2026and the ability to rise from your ashes and return!\nExclusive Kickstarter Content! \u2013 Pledge now so you don\u2019t miss out!  Kickstarter set comes with these exclusive items you won't find in stores later*:  \n* Exclusive content layout and visuals will vary from those pictured on this page.  Exclusive items may be sold by Calliope Games at conventions or online but will not be available through standard distribution.\nEvery copy of the game comes with:\n4 innovative game trays, which connect to form the game board\n36 double-sided Path tiles \n1 Phoenix tile \n1 translucent acrylic First Player marker\n8 Phoenix miniatures \n8 glass bead \"ash\" Life tokens \n7 \"glowing\" translucent Lantern markers: 3 Red, 2 Blue, and 2 Yellow\n50 golden Star tokens\n1 Rulebook\nThe Kickstarter Exclusive Set also features these upgrades and additional materials which will not be available as add-ons later:\nAnd every copy of the game will come with these unlocked stretch goals:\nHere's a closer look at some of the premium components included in every copy of the game:\nEight beautifully sculpted Phoenix miniatures\nSeven \"glowing\" translucent Lantern markers in three shapes.\nThe unique patented tray allows one tile to be flipped and rotated without disturbing the others.\n*Note that the final appearance of all components and upgrades may change. \nTsuro: Phoenix Rising is built on the foundation of the classic game Tsuro: The Game of the Path by Tom McMurchie.  Some core gameplay elements remain, such as placing tiles and moving your pawn along the path.  However, as a Phoenix, your turns in the game will now consist of extending your path, moving your Phoenix pawn, transforming Lanterns into Stars, and scoring Stars to make a constellation!\nFor additional copies of the standard retail edition of Tsuro: Phoenix Rising, manually add $40 per game to your pledge.  There is no extra shipping for one additional copy.  To receive 3-6 copies of the game, manually add double the shipping cost. \nPledge $20 now to be a part of the Tsuro: Phoenix Rising retailer program and receive your full margin plus 4 additional points for your support.  You may choose the Standard Retail Edition or Kickstarter Exclusive Set.  You will also have an opportunity to fill out your order with other Calliope titles at the same margin; FFA $350 (destination USA - See FAQ for details).  Retailer orders will be shipped with all other Kickstarter orders prior to standard distribution. Your final order and payment will not be finalized until the game is ready to ship.  Orders must be placed in case quantities (6 units per case); maximum two cases per location. \nPhysical store verification will be required; you must provide the store name, store address, phone number, EIN number, and website or Facebook page. If you choose this option and we determine you are not a brick-and-mortar retailer, you will be charged the difference in price for one standard retail edition of Tsuro: Phoenix Rising after the campaign. No refunds will be issued. Result of the verification process by Calliope Games will be final.  \nNOTE: International retailer copies will be shipped at the same time as all international backer copies; international freight forwarding may cause delays in fulfillment.  \nThe truth is, we packed all possible quality and value in the presentation of Tsuro: Phoenix Rising.  Upgraded tile thickness?  Done.  Fancy components?  Included.  Amazing tray?  You got it!!  So we can't approach stretch goals the same way other campaigns might.\nInstead, we are going to treat stretch goals as a bonus for backers, to celebrate the entire Tsuro series!\nEveryone at the Standard Retail Edition, Kickstarter Exclusive Set, Legacy of Tsuro, or Way of the Retailer pledge levels will receive all unlocked stretch goals when Tsuro: Phoenix Rising is fulfilled!  No additional charge or shipping will be required!  \nA note about grouping multiple copies of Tsuro: Phoenix Rising:\nEach copy of Tsuro: Phoenix Rising at the Standard Retail Edition, Kickstarter Exclusive Set, Legacy of Tsuro, or Way of the Retailer levels will come with one of each stretch goal item, so you can put together a group pledge and every copy will come with the goodies!  This also means retailers will be able to provide the stretch goal items for all copies!\nWe are offering subsidized shipping costs in order to strike the best balance of value for our backers and actual cost to us. We have strategically partnered with trusted fulfillment partners around the world experienced in shipping Kickstarter rewards.\n*See Update #2 for list of EU Neighbor countries. \nThe above costs reflect the Standard Retail Edition and Kickstarter Exclusive Set pledge levels; Way of the Retailer and Legacy of Tsuro levels may be slightly higher due to quantity of boxes to be shipped.  Shipping costs will be charged after the campaign ends through CrowdOx. \n10 years ago, Calliope Games began as a collaboration between Dawne Weisman, Jordan Weisman, and Ray Wehrs. All of us are experienced game industry professionals who have worked together since 1999 when we collectively launched WizKids. Calliope Games has been producing and selling quality tabletop games since 2009. Our products are inspired by family for families. To date we have released 19 titles, many of which were brought to life here on Kickstarter!\nAt Calliope Games, we publish fun, affordable, family-style tabletop games for all to enjoy.  \nWith gamers in mind, our games make the perfect \"gateway\" or \"filler\" game. They allow you to easily draft your non-gamer friends into your favorite hobby. Calliope games are excellent for starting out game night and are easily played between heavier games. It\u2019s important to point out to our non-gamer friends that we do take a slightly different approach to the games we produce. At Calliope, we focus on entertaining adults; however, the games we produce allow children to compete with their parents without the parents \u201cthrowing\u201d the game. It\u2019s a really a pretty simple concept; instead of having the parents step down into the child\u2019s world, we are inviting the child to step up into the parents' world.  \nFor gamers and non-gamers alike, the results of our efforts are games that are accessible by all players regardless of skill level or age, play in under 60 minutes, are affordably priced, and most of all\u2026 are a blast to play!\nIf you would like to add other amazing games from our catalog to your pledge, you may do so by manually adjusting your pledge using the amounts below.

The biggest foreseeable risks we currently face are manufacturing in China and shipping issues from China to our warehouse here in the US.\n\nEach of these risks is greatly minimized with Calliope Games. Our factories have been with us for many years. They know how we work and the quality we expect. In addition, our freight forwarder and fulfillment teams are world class and have over 30 years of expertise to rely upon. If any issues arise, we will know of them far in advance and will be able to overcome them.\n\nUpcoming tariffs may influence costs as well. Typically these are 10%-25% of our total manufacturing cost. Should tariffs affect prices, these will be reflected in the post-campaign shipping and fulfillment cost.\n\nAs far as the unseen risks... we know they are there and we have built a safety margin into our costs of goods sold to prepare us for the unforeseen.

From fevered sketches in dog-eared notebooks, the idea for a pulp horror adventure board game was born.\nTo celebrate the 10th year of the conceptual birth of Ancient Terrible Things (ATT), and to coincide with the re-print of a rare expansion, Pleasant Company Games presents a 14-day Kickstarter campaign for backers new and old. \nFor those ready to complete their ATT collections, and for those new to the rusting riverboat, welcome to the journey and celebration of the cult pulp horror dice-chucker!\nSketches, photos and exploration; circa 2008\nWhy Kickstarter?\nOver the years we have developed a strong community of followers on the Kickstarter platform, and we see Kickstarter as being the natural place to celebrate this milestone. Though Ancient Terrible Things is available from selective retailers in the US and EU, the products can be hard to find in the rest of the world. \nStretch goals\nThis campaign does not feature stretch goals, as the the campaign is geared towards offering re-printed and existing content to new and existing backers. \nLimited quantities\nThe campaign will run for 14 days with limited copies available in each tier level. \nQuantities will be adjusted dynamically in each tier level to accommodate overall reprint quantities (500 for the Lost Charter) and available stock (500 ATT base game).\nAll products for this Kickstarter campaign are shipped from the USA, and may be subject to customs compliance in the destination country.\nWhat would a Kickstarter campaign be without exclusive content. AwakeTen KS campaign includes a printable digital wallpaper of the new dice-tray artwork in The Lost Charter 2nd Impression printing, for all pledge levels and  a limited edition promo Encounter card for all backers at Colonel pledge level ($15+) or higher.\n Ancient Terrible Things (2014) is the original Dicequest tabletop game. Set on a jungle river, explorers travel by riverboat to uncover Ancient Secrets. Along the way they will face Pitfalls, Villains, Horrors and Artefacts - all which award fame and madness. The core game features 104 unique cards, 11 translucent dice, game board of the river with its Fateful Locations, 144 tokens, wooden pawns and player boards.\nAncient Terrible Things: The Lost Charter (2015) was the first expansion for ATT and has been out of print for a few a years. As part of this KS campaign, Pleasant Co. Games will be re-printing 500 copies of the expansion.  The Lost Charter introduces travel-friendly cards for all the Locations, solo rules, a 5th playable character, 2 new purple Revelation dice and new game mechanics, including Foreshadowing, Trade Offers and Character Obsessions.\nAncient Terrible Things: Madness of McGuffin (2017) is the latest mini-expansion for ATT. With the release of Konja(2017), the second game to feature the Dicequest game system as used in Ancient Terrible Things, the designer introduced a streamlined re-roll system and  resource dice to the game.\nThese changes have been introduced to ATT through the Madness of McGuffin expansion, which includes two Starting Swag cards for each of the four principle characters in ATT. Along with new white Resource dice and a full set of translucent custom Skullpip dice, the  expansion adds new ways to play with extra atmosphere and suspense.\nMcGuffins' Mask is activated with a white die and two Focus tokens to re-roll two dice.

What used to be virtual reality is now reality, and sports that once occupied your flat-screen now occupy the world stage. The largest of them embodies the evolution and integration of athleticism and machinery. Once every five years, hundreds of millions of viewers tune in to witness the spectacle that is M.E.C.H.s: Mechanized Entertainment Combat Heroes.\nSuit up your Meeples for the ultimate battle royale with...\nSome items displayed are stretch goals and will need to be unlocked.\nThe amazing ITEMeeples are snapped into your Mech when you earn it in play!\nMotion GIF may take a moment to load.\nTiny Epic Mechs is an arena-style player-vs-player action-programming game. It features ITEMeeples with plastic molded power armors and a Mech suit that the ITEMeeples actually go inside of. \nIn Tiny Epic Mechs, players take on the roles of highly skilled and athletic Mech pilots. \nThey compete in a free-for-all battle royale over the span of six rounds. In each round, players select four of eight available actions to program. \nThese actions keep you moving around the arena while allowing you to deploy high-scoring defensive turrets, plant explosive land mines with hidden values, collect resources, purchase weaponry, and power up into your Power Armor or eventually the highly-sought-after Mech Suit. While each player has their own Power Armor, there is only one Mech Suit, reserved for the king of the hill. \nYour programmed actions are played out one at a time around the table until all players have executed their four actions. When you cross paths with another player, combat ensues. During combat, players exchange fire until one player is out of ammo and must retreat, or they are defeated and forced to reset. \nCombat is fast, and you can use each weapon only one time per fight, so the more weapons you have, the longer you'll last. Weapons are categorized into three types, and each type counters one of the other types. If you time your weapons correctly, you can counter your opponent and unleash a more powerful attack and gain an edge over them. Dealing a lot of damage to your opponent will wow the audience and earn you lots of points, which brings you closer to victory. You also score victory points every other round based on area control and who controls the Mech. At the end of the game, you also earn points for each weapon you own. \nWhy Back This Project? \n Great Gameplay! - Fast paced and easy gameplay gets you right into the action.

Most of the cash has been hidden away, and the rest has been invested in businesses throughout the city. Everything is going according to plan until the police get a breakthrough in their investigation. Accusations are made, fingers are pointed, and after a heated argument, you decide to go your separate ways. Chaos ensues as the SWAT team is called in and starts to close off the city\u2019s exits. Your only choice now is to escape the city before it is completely locked down. But you need a plan \u2014 a good route that allows you to leave the city while recovering as much of the money as possible.   \nYou will need to call in some favors and hire the local gangs to create diversions. Bribing the Police would be a good idea too, but it isn't cheap. Disguises may help, but they don\u2019t fool everyone. Setting the Police on the trail of your former colleagues will give you a better chance of escape, but the other thieves are thinking the same thing.  \nWill you escape the city with the most money, or will the Police lock down the city before you can escape?\nIn Escape Plan, players are the thieves, but they may influence the cops' moves every turn. The robbers move on a modular board trying to reach the best spots to recover their loot and escape from the city with more money than the other thieves. The cops are trying to thwart their escape plan \u2014 by force if necessary. The players play cards to aid their escape and slow the other players down. The players take actions that allow them to move and to engage gangs, mules, and snitches.  \nPlayers use hidden asymmetric goals to recover the maximum amount of cash during the game while avoiding the police. The players' roles as thieves are individual with every player for themselves. In the end, only the player who escapes with the most cash wins.  \nClick to Download the Draft Escape Plan Rulebook\nClick to read a draft of the German rules.\nClick to read a draft of the French rules text.\n  LIVE PLAY-THROUGH:\nLive Playthrough with GeekSpiel\nQ&A with designer Vital Larcerda\n.  \n    PLAY\n\n        Click to read their full review on BoardGameGeek.com\nClick for the full write up on BoardGameGeek.com\nLooking to try out your skills in Escape Plan for FREE?

This Unfair expansion brings four new themes to take its replayability through the roof. Mix them with your old favourites, or with each other to discover all new strategies to master in this thrill ride of a game.\nLook out for the Late Pledge button after the campaign ends.\n More details in the Stretch Goal section later in the page.\nThis expansion adds even more replayability to the Unfair base game. With the base game alone, there are 15 combinations of themes for a 4 player game - throw in the expansion and that goes up to over 200!\nAliens have arrived, but they assure us they only want to serve humanity. Help with their research projects and they offer Alien Influence in return, a new type of currency worth 2 points each at game end.\n You can earn Alien Influence by building attractions and upgrades so the aliens can observe us in our natural environment. These are marked with an Alien Influence symbol in place of a star.\nThen use your accumulated influence with the aliens to build advanced technology to improve your park - the price is marked on the pricetag.\nBe careful! If any staff should happen to get any Alien Influence on themselves, they will disappear mysteriously at the end of the round, shuffled back into the Park deck!\nB-movie enables scoring for building panoramas, including those in the base game's 6 themes. With a little effort, some spectacular scenes are possible.\nB-movie adds some useful new features to help you build the right attractions in the right order to complete your panorama.\nMashing up themes on the same attraction can have all kinds of benefits... \n ... all to help you make movies so awful they're awesome.\nDiscover a mysterious valley filled with living dinosaurs, offering exciting new ways to draw a crowd... for a park owner willing to take the risk.\nAdd live dinosaurs to your park! With high stars and low cost, they come with enclosures that are just barely adequate, so each round you must roll to determine if they rampage.\nYou can build electrified fences to properly contain them, or use some careful risk management to keep them under control.\nIf your park is all about dinosaurs you can enhance guest security, or turn it into an island, using a new type of Showcase card - the replacement park entrance.\nThe Old West offers wide open spaces, big projects, sudden riches... and robbery. Quality upgrades represent gold nuggets in this theme pack - discovered, dug up, and spent to improve the frontier town in your park.\nWith an extra lot in your park, you finally have space to build more than 5 attractions. You can even build two super attractions at once!\nThe Western theme doesn't turn on panorama scoring by itself, but when played with a theme that does, like B-movie, the Western panorama cards can be placed in any order to make for some awesome vistas.\nThe sheriff is tough but fair, but even he can't keep the local bandits completely under control\n                                                               Don't like being hounded by the city and their Unfair City cards? Now you can make yourself immune by accepting the Djinni's Bargain.\nPrefer to limit demolitions in your park, but without stopping all interactions entirely? You need better Building Insurance!\nHow about some warning of what the city plans to do to you? A little Prescience will let you peek at the future.\nMore variety in your 2-player games? Just add One For The Pot.\nPlay these in combination with other game changers to tweak the play style to suit your group's preference.\nComponents - ABDW expansion:\n262 cards in total featuring 111 new illustrations\n4 new theme packs of 57 cards - Alien, B-movie, Dinosaur, Western\n4 new Game Changer cards \n30 Alien Influence tokens, in values of 1, 3, 9\n8 Insurance Excess tokens (for use with the Building Insurance game changer)\n1 Dinosaur Rampage reminder marker\n1 Alien Abduction reminder marker\n32 page narrow-format rulebook\nPackage: Base game + ABDW expansion\nThe cover for this expansion joins onto the base game box to create a panoramic scene, and future expansions will extend the scene even further.\nSpecifications:\nCards: 300gsm black core stock, matte lamination, round corners.\nBox: 12\" x 5.3\", 2mm greyboard, matte lamination.\nTokens: 2.5mm greyboard, matte finish.\n Read Neil's full review on BGG here\nListen to The Dicemen Cometh podcast episode here \nThe Unfair base game reached all of its stretch goals, including upgrades to card stock and token thickness, so this expansion for Unfair starts pre-stretched with those same features.\n\nIn the base game campaign, we were able to add two extra theme packs as stretch goals. That was possible because we had been working on the game for five years beforehand.\n\nThis time we have a number of stretch goals to reveal, but we need to warn you that none of them is on the scale of an extra theme pack.\nWe pre-pack Unfair in a robust mailer box at the factory, and use quality fulfillment companies in each region to stay tax free for backers and keep shipping costs as low as possible globally.\nUSD$12 for shipping is included in the Expansion pledge tier, and USD$17 in the Unfair + Expansion pledge tier. Backers in some regions will need to pay additional fees in these ranges:\nUnfair is the beautiful and lovingly cynical brainchild of designer Joel Finch. The original base game was literally a 5 year labour of love, designed in no small part because his stupendously fabulous wife Kate wasn't interested in playing Magic the Gathering with him.\nThe Unfair world is a contrast of pure theme park fun, happy childhood memories, and blue skies...\n...and the gritty, impersonal, sometimes nasty world of commerce. What do people say while they knife their competitors? It's just business...\nThis first expansion sees the addition of four theme packs that complement the original set. Development of these four themes has taken place over the last four years, with worldwide blind playtesting beginning in December 2017.\nThe original 6 themes provided 15 possible combinations for a 4-player game. With the 4 new themes, that total increases to over 200 possible combinations!\nThe game looks mostly finished - so why do we need Kickstarter?\nUnfair's large number of deluxe illustrations mean it has a high art cost relative to its sale price, and success at Kickstarter is the way we can recoup that. Without Kickstarter, the budget for art would be significantly lower, and we would need to have fewer unique pieces and/or accept lower detail for many of them.\nSuccess at Kickstarter also helps us to recoup the costs more quickly than sales through retail, so funds can be applied to future development immediately, speeding up the timeline for upcoming expansions. Which is handy, because we have plans underway to fill out the alphabet with a range of new themes and mechanics.\n\nWe can get more eyes on the final result *before* it goes to print, which helps to improve the quality. The base game was improved in many details by the feedback of backers during the Kickstarter campaign, and we hope you can help us there again.\nUsing Kickstarter also allows us to improve the result over the minimum retail product by adding stretch goals, and have a little fun with a few sneak peeks of future packs that we wouldn't be able to justify otherwise.\n\nIn short, with your help through Kickstarter, we can make games more awesome.\nOver 250 playtesting groups provided feedback to help improve and polish this expansion. Thank you to you all!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our 3rd Kickstarter project. \n\nOur artists have proven very reliable and we have confirmed they can complete the listed stretch goal card illustrations by the end of this campaign, and we won't be pushing them beyond that.\n\nRules are complete and formatted, and only need final blue-ink commentary from our resident grumpy former theme park owner.\n\nBackers' games will be pre-boxed in shipping boxes at the point of manufacture for faster and more consistent shipping. They will feature internal corner protectors to reduce risk of corner damage caused by dropped boxes.\n\nLast time we had some production issues in some of the Kickstarter copies of Unfair. We rectified the issues and replaced cards and components for all the backers that requested them. It was a huge job but we are committed to providing quality games so we did everything possible to rectify the situation. \n\nBut this time we have a longer checklist of things to TRIPLE check, and our factory has committed to improving their quality, and ramped up their Quality Control processes. We own our own card die now, and this is a simpler project. We won't be caught out again. \n\nIf you find you still somehow need any replacement cards we do have some left.

Cultists are summoning one of the Elder Ones to consume our world, and it is up to the ragtag group of investigators to face the nightmarish forces and disrupt the ritual long enough to make the Elder One vulnerable. And then kill it dead.\nFind out more about these Optional Buys in the following links: Season 2 Expansion, Black Goat of the Woods, Art Book, Extra Dice, Frost Dice.\nDesigned by Rob Daviau and Eric M. Lang, the game features monster artwork by Adrian Smith and investigator artwork by Karl Kopinski. Investigators come from all walks of life, each bringing a unique skill to the team, as well as two other generic skills.\nArt by Karl Kopinski, sculpts by RN Estudio.\nMadness is always at your side when battling unthinkable monstrosities from other dimensions. In fact, the investigators already start the game with a diagnosed insanity, which will will be triggered by your encounters with the occult. You may be doomed by your mental breakdown, or learn to use it to your advantage. The closer you are to losing your mind completely, the more powerful your skills will become.\nArt by Filipe Pagliuso.\nSummoning the Elder Gods are fanatic cultists, and the hosts of nightmarish monstrosities aiding  them in their cause. Each of these enemies possesses its own special ability and combat strength. They are not controlled by any player, but instead have their behavior triggered by Mythos cards used for each specific episode.\nArt by Adrian Smith. Sculpts by Thierry Masson, Yannick Hennebo, Remy Tremblay, Michael Jenkins, Edgar Skomorowski, and Jose Roig.\nThe Death May Die core box contains smaller boxes that hold the modular elements to create each unique game session. Players choose one of the two available Elder Ones and combine their contents with those of one of the six available Episodes. Each of these boxes contain unique figures, tokens, and cards that are only used when playing with those elements. The Mythos deck used in each game is a combination of cards from the chosen Elder One box and the chosen Episode box. Each Episode not only indicates the map setup using the various tiles in the game, but also new actions the investigators can perform in order to accomplish the tasks required to disrupt that episode's ritual. They each also bring their own Discovery cards for players to explore, and the monsters' behaviors and abilities are tailored to each unique story.\nHastur, known as the King in Yellow, and his disciples brand the world with their terrible Yellow Sign. Those that suffer this doom quickly meet their fate by the hands of death or madness.\nArt by Adrian Smith. Disciple sculpt by Thierry Masson. Hastur sculpt by JAG.\nCthulhu, The Thing That Should Not Be, will bring his sunken kingdom of R'lyeh into our world, plunging the earth into a nightmarish reality.\nArt by Adrian Smith. Cthulhu sculpt by Michael Jenkins. Star Spawn sculpt by Aragorn Marks.\nThe Elder Ones start the game off the board; as they move along the summoning track their growing presence invites chaos and insanity into the world to accompany their grand awakening. Eventually they cross over and the real nightmare begins. If the investigators have managed to disrupt the ritual, the Elder One becomes vulnerable and may (just possibly) be killed for good. If not, the investigators now have to contend with an immortal behemoth hunting them while they try to accomplish their tasks. Either way, killing the Elder One will not be easy, not by a long shot, as each time it's bested it grows more enraged and powerful. In the end, either all investigators will fall or death will come for the Great Old One.\nInvestigators, Cultists, Star Spawn, Cthulhu and Hastur painted by Robert Karlsson. Byakee, Deep One, Ghoul, and Shoggoth painted by Fabrizio Russo. Cthonian, Fire Vampire, and Hunting Horror painted by Angel Giraldez. PLEASE NOTE FIGURES COME UNPAINTED.\nIn their mission to thwart the cultist's plans, investigators engage in more than combat. If they can get some respite, they can discover all sorts of things to potentially help them in their tasks. Discovery cards are unique to each Episode, and present the investigators with challenges or choices that will grant them different resources, companions or negative effects.\nCthulhu: Death May Die core box comes with:\n45 Highly-Detailed Plastic Figures\n17 Terrain Tiles\n30 Plastic Tentacle Tokens\n8 Custom Dice\n5 Counter Bases\n10 Investigator Dashboards\n186 Cards\n120 Tokens\n1 Rulebook\nWIP Rulebook\nPlease be aware that this is a Work In Progress Rulebook.

So, if you see anything in here that isn't the same later, understand that during the Kickstarter the project is still in development and all aspects are subject to improvements.\nUnspeakable Pledge - $100\nBackers with an Unspeakable Pledge will receive a copy of the Cthulhu: Death May Die core box, the Kickstarter Exclusive Investigator Julia, plus all applicable Stretch Goals.\nSculpt by RN Estudio. Painting by Robert Karlsson.\nJulia is an incredibly level-headed investigator. Given the extraordinary circumstances she finds herself in, it's amazing how she can keep her wits about her. Her unique skill allows her to take wounds instead of stress, greatly increasing her chances of success in any given encounter. Though it may cost her life in the end...\nR'lyeh Rising Pledge - $250\nBackers with a R'lyeh Rising Pledge will receive a copy of the Cthulhu: Death May Die core box, the Kickstarter Exclusive R'lyeh Rising expansion, and the Kickstarter Exclusive Investigator Julia, plus all applicable Stretch Goals.\nAs the production of this statue is extremely expensive and time-consuming, delivery of it will be staggered. However, all backers will receive the rest of the base pledge at the same time. \nCheck out THIS UPDATE for for answers to some pressing questions, extra gameplay information, and shipping cost estimates.\nLet's not be coy, the heart and soul of the R'lyeh Rising expansion is its colossal figure of Cthulhu! This cyclopean creation is something never before seen in the world of board gaming. Its base is 44 x 44 cm wide, and it stands 57 cm tall to the tip of its wings. In fact, this thing is so huge that his base becomes the board on which the game is played! This plastic statue was sculpted in terrifying detail and will come pre-assembled, with the exception of the clip-on wings, so it can be proudly displayed for all to see.\nSculpt by Remy Tremblay (Julia figure included for scale).\nR'lyeh Rising is a wholly unique Episode, the epic finale to Death May Die, not only bringing its own set of tokens, Discovery cards, Monster cards, and Mythos cards, but also drastic changes to the game's base rules, as the figures move and act freely upon the behemoth's rocky base.\nPainting by Angel Giraldez (Cultist figures included for scale).\nPLEASE NOTE ALL FIGURES COME UNPAINTED.\nNote that anything marked with this:\nis an exclusive item for Kickstarter backers, with remaining stock available through conventions and special promotions only.\nThe CMON team dives into a gameplay overview of Death May Die with Episode 1 - Blasphemous Alchemy:\nFind out more about the Season 2 Expansion HERE.\nFind out more about the Black Goat of the Woods HERE. \nFind out more about the Art Book HERE.\nFind out more about the Extra Dice HERE.\nFind out more about the Frost Dice HERE.\nPlease Take Note!\nBased on past experience, we will be charging shipping after the Kickstarter concludes based on the actual costs incurred to ship. We will collect this via our pledge manager after the campaign ends, using PayPal. This is so we can be fair to all our backers as shipping is rarely one size fits all, and also give you more stretch goodies and possibly a choice of carrier options.\nWe will ship your rewards at our cost to our international hubs. Depending on where in the world you are, we will either ship to you from our hub in the UK (EU backers), China (Asia Pacific backers), Canada (Canadian backers), Australia (Australia and New Zealand backers) or Atlanta (USA and the rest of the world). Following is a list of rough estimates for shipping a standard game package (4kg volumetric weight). Keep in mind these are just estimates, and costs may rise based on weight increases from unlocked stretch goals and any optional buys you choose.\nUSA: $10-$20 to most states. $50 to Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. \nCANADA: $15-$30 to most cities. \nLATIN AMERICA: $70-$80 to most countries. \nASIA: $10 to China and Hong Kong. $35 to most other countries (we can\u2019t predict an estimate cost to Malaysia). Backers in China, please read THIS UPDATE.\nOCEANIA: $20-$45 to Australia. $40 to New Zealand. \nAFRICA: $95 to most countries. \nEUROPE: $20-$30 to most countries. \n \u2022 $35 to Norway, Switzerland, Finland, Estonia, and Latvia. \n \u2022 $50 to Bosnia/Herzegowina, Croatia, and Iceland. \n \u2022 $70-$80 to Israel, Liechtenstein, and Serbia. \nUnfortunately, different import laws and customs have made it impossible for CMON to ship games to certain specific countries.\n*WE DO NOT SHIP TO:* Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Afghanistan.\nBe aware that all pledges that are confirmed after the pledge manager deadline will be shipped from the US hub at a later date. For non-US backers that will likely incur increased shipping costs. We also cannot ship to PO Boxes domestically or internationally. Due to the size of each package there is too great a risk of the package being bounced back to us.\nThe table below gives you a general idea of the full schedule of what to expect once the campaign ends. Keep in mind these are just estimates, and the timeline may vary due to circumstances.\nTo learn about Retail Pledges click HERE.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our 32nd Kickstarter, and there are some vagaries in terms of timing when it comes to anything produced in China, such as: \nProduction delays \nShipping delays \nCustoms delays\n\nThe estimated delivery date for this project is July 2019, but keep in mind this is only an estimate. Also, due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others.\n\nWe've done our best to minimize this as much as possible, and we are always happy to refund pledges if for some totally unforeseen reason the game can't be delivered at all. Since the game is 90% complete, we don't believe this is in the least bit likely. We've successfully delivered Zombicide, Sedition Wars, Guilds of Cadwallon, Zombicide Season 2, Relic Knights, Rivet Wars, Kaosball, Dogs of War, Arcadia Quest, Wrath of Kings, XenoShyft, our Base System, Zombicide Season 3, The World of Smog: On Her Majesty's Service, Rum & Bones, Blood Rage, B-Sieged, Zombicide: Black Plague, The Others, XenoShyft: Dreadmire and Masmorra: Dungeons of Arcadia, Arcadia Quest: Inferno, Rum & Bones: Second Tide, Massive Darkness, The World of Smog: Rise of Moloch, Rising Sun, and Zombicide: Green Horde. A Song of Ice & Fire: Tabletop Miniatures Game is currently shipping to backers.\n\nWe have three ongoing projects currently: HATE, Zombicide: Invader, and Arcadia Quest: Riders, which are in production.\n\nPlease refer to our individual project pages if you'd like to check the progress there. Each project is entirely independent from each other, has completely different development teams, and has no effect on the production flow or development of Cthulhu: Death May Die.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nWe can refund you within 14 days of the campaign\u2019s end, fees included. After that, we have a policy of no questions asked, though that\u2019s minus Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we can\u2019t get back from them after 14 days). However, if we\u2019ve begun packaging your pledge for shipment (usually 4 to 6 weeks before the actual shipping date), no refunds are possible. If a component cannot be delivered AT ALL, we refund that completely, including fees.\n\nAll refunds after the 14 days close of the campaign may be processed via Paypal or reversed via Stripe to your credit card at our discretion. Refunds within 14 days are reversed via Stripe to your credit card.\n\nThis project is being funded in USD and any refunds processed will be in USD for the exact amount received in USD, excluding any applicable fees depending on the time of the refund being processed.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look, materials and content of the rewards (and the project) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented while the Kickstarter project was active.\n\nIf you do not log in and confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email to confirm your pledge, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received. However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your pledge if you contact us and confirm your pledge after the 8 week window has elapsed. Unconfirmed pledges make it difficult for us to plan production and logistics, and in the past have led to project delays. For this project we do not intend to allow this to happen, which may mean if you confirm your pledge too late, exclusive items may not be produced in sufficient quantity for your pledge.\n\nIf you confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods.

Late pledges available on BackerKit soon.\nWe are Campaign Coins. We make beautiful metal coins and tokens for tabletop games.  \nWe also love meeples. So, we thought... why not make some?\nWe asked our artist and game designer friend Daniel Solis to do the art (he likes meeples too). We then used the experience with industrial casting and antique metal plating which we have brought to all of our coins since 2007, and then spruced them up with the beautiful new enamels we started using in 2015.\nAnd you know what? Even we're surprised by how hecking nice these are.\nMeeple prototypes. They heart you.\nWe think they'll make you smile. You might fancy a special set for yourself (the red ones are pretty sweet). Perhaps you'll go full meeple and get a complete set of all colours to bling out every game in your collection. Maybe you'd just like a collector pack of one of each to line up on your desk to brighten each work day.\nBecause everybody loves meeples. Right? Right. We thought so.\nThe meeples are standard size: 16 mm (3/5 inches) from side to side, and the same from head to feet. They are 10 mm thick (2/5 inches).\nThey are die cast metal, with hand polished edges. We have given each meeple a unique antique metal finish. Each meeple also has its own pattern, which we have sealed with a different translucent colour enamel.\nThis means that when you are gaming, you can tell which ones are yours from whichever angle you look at them. From above, you can see the different metal, and face on, you can see the pattern or the colour.\nMeeple prototype colour line up\nHere are the combos you can see in the lineup photo above:\nRed Hearts with Antique Copper\nYellow Daisies with Shining Gold\nGreen Bamboo with Antique Bronze\nBlue Waves with Platinum\nPurple Stars with Antique Silver\nBlack Skulls with Black Nickel\nAntique plating prototypes, from left: Blue, Red, Green, Yellow, Black, Purple\nThe meeples stand up straight or lie down flat. And they are heavy! A single metal meeple weighs a hefty 11 grams (\u2156 oz), ten times the weight of a regular wooden meeple.\nIf you look at them side on, you can see where we polish the joins. We finish them by hand, and we like the slight imperfection, they look more handcrafted than machined.\nWe hope the photos do them justice. They're just so pleasing.\nHow do you make a meeple?\nRead about how the meeples came to be in Update #2\nRead about how we refined the meeple designs in Update #4\nRead about our bonus Mt Fuji meeple stretch goal in Update #5\nFor more meeple fun, see our #meepleholiday photo gallery.\nThanks: AUD $1 (~ USD $1)  \nThanks for your support! You'll get the updates and follow our progress. We'd give you a meeple high five too, but meeples don't have fingers.\nLucky Meeple: AUD $10 (~ USD $8)\nWe will send you a single Red Heart Meeple. No other Add Ons are permitted for this pledge, and there are no Stretch Goals for you sorry. Postage is included worldwide.\nMeeple Pack (AUD $30 /~USD $23)\nThere are six types of Deluxe Metal Meeple.

If we reach this goal, everyone who pledges for a Collector Pack or higher will receive a single Mt Fuji meeple in Shining Bronze. We will never this again with the same combo of colour enamel and antique finish. The only way to get this limited edition version is to pledge here. For more about this meeple, see Update #5.\nBonus meeple: Mt Fuji in dark blue with Shining Bronze\nArtist Bonus (AUD $30,000)  \nYOU DID IT! After the Bonus Meeple, we have no more physical stretch goals to offer, sorry. (Really. We're being careful, as we don't want to disappoint you by promising too much).\nBut gosh, we do want to share your generosity with the artist who made it all possible. So, we will pay a 50% bonus to the art fee we have already paid to Daniel Solis. You are all meeple royalty now!\nIf you would like Add Ons, please increase your pledge by that amount. We will check what you want and charge the correct shipping in BackerKit after the campaign ends.\nMeeple Pack: AUD $30 (~USD $23): Either a Colour Pack of 8 meeples of the same colour, or a Collector Pack of 6 meeples, one of each colour.\nNote, rather than buy this as an Add On, you will get much better value by increasing to a higher pledge level.\nMore than Eight Packs?\nWow, you really like meeples. Thank you! If you have gone for our TEN OF EACH or EIGHT PACK pledge levels, and still want more packs, then you get the special Add On price of AUD $22 (~USD $17) for each additional set you add on top of your Eight Pack pledge.\nNote, you must be at the Ten of Each or the Eight Pack pledge levels to quality for this special price.\nSingle Meeples?\nWe are really sorry, but we cannot offer single meeple Add Ons, as the risk of error is too great. If this campaign is successful, we will offer single meeples on our website at a later date. We chose sets of 8 meeples as the most popular number, although we know that different games have different requirements. We hope you can understand our decision. We had to draw the meeple line somewhere.\nKing's Ransom Coin Set AUD $45 (~USD $35): This is a set of 50 of our high quality metal coins, great for use with any Euro-themed board game. The set contains 25 x Copper-1 coins, 15 x Silver-5 coins, 10 x Gold-20 coins, and a single Gold 10,000-coin to use as a first player marker, all in a red velvet bag. Note, the denominations on the coins are tiny, so you can ignore the numbers and change the values to suit different games. We are offering this Add On at a slight discount to our regular website price. For shipping purposes, the weight is the same as two meeple sets.\nOur Board Games with Coins PDF lists the coins needed for popular board games.\nThat's All: We don't intend to offer any other Add Ons, because we want to make it smooth and easy to ship these to you. But, you can buy all of our regular range of coins right now at CampaignCoins.com\nCampaign Coins are brought to you by King of the Castle Games. We are based in Melbourne, Australia. We were the first to bring metal coins to the board gamers and roleplayers way back in 2007, and then as now we manufacture them to the finest possible quality. Our coins and tokens look great, and are hard wearing. We want you to play with them for life.\nIn 2018 we will also start publishing our own line of card and board games, starting with Rochi, designed by James Ernest and Sonia Orin Lyris.\nPlease note: the pledge levels do not include postage. Like many other Kickstarter projects these days, we have decided to charge shipping in Backerkit after the campaign ends. This will allow us to give you the most fair and accurate shipping charge possible, based on the exact weight of your pledge, and the information at the time of shipping.\nOrders from USA and Canada will be fulfilled from America.\nOrders from Europe will be fulfilled from the EU. Customs duties will not apply within the EU.\nOrders from Australia, New Zealand and Asia will be fulfilled from Australia.\nWe cannot accept pledges from South America. We're really sorry, but we don't currently have a fulfilment solution that offers you reasonably priced secure shipping. The meeples will be available from our website if this project is successful, and you can order then.\nSHIPPING ESTIMATES\nHere are our current estimates on shipping costs, based on the data we have right now. While we will be charging you in Australian Dollars (AUD), for clarity we have listed your local currency for shipping estimates:\nAustralia: One set AUD $3 | Five sets AUD $15\nNew Zealand: One set ~NZD $6 | Five sets ~NZD $23\nAsia: One set AUD $6 | Five sets AUD $30\nUSA: One set ~USD $5 | Five sets ~USD $14\nCanada: One set ~CAD $9 | Five sets ~CAD $26\nUnited Kingdom: One set ~GBP \u00a35 | Five sets ~GBP \u00a310\nEU: One set ~EUR \u20ac5 | Five sets ~EUR \u20ac12\nRest of World: One set ~EUR \u20ac6 | Five sets ~EUR \u20ac14\n For a complete photo gallery, please visit our Facebook photo album.\nDeluxe Metal Meeple prototypes: Facebook photo album\nRevised Flower Meeple design", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have been making coins since 2007, and this is our fifth Kickstarter.

See the FAQ if you want to get Add-Ons in packs of 10.\nThis the best price you'll get, since buying directly from us will cut out the middlemen.

Some Add-Ons may not be available again.\nWe have plans to support retail and distribution if our margins work, so please message us if you have an opportunity or offer. We aren't sure what the future holds for GROWL, but we love the game and hope you'll support us today.\nShipping is charged after the campaign (when stretch goals are determined and the product is finalized). These are estimates. The game will be about 10 ounces, 6x4x2.5 inches. These prices do not include additional shipping if you purchase add-ons.\nUnited States - $3, Canada - $5, Mexico - $8.50, China - $5\nBackers in *MOST* other countries will be charged about $11. We are EU-friendly (rewards to the EU will be shipped from within the EU).\n4/23/18: A quick update on shipping. My Stamps.com software claims that nearly all international shipments of the boxed games will be under $11. But apparently foreign countries don't always delivery packages for the rates they are supposed to, and may destroy or hold shipments hostage. I had a long conversation with a Kickstarter game creator who has shipped hundreds of thousands of games. He told me the two biggest problem countries in his experience were Russia (he suggested not even accepting backers from Russia), and Brazil (the post office is on strike). Some island countries like Australia cost a lot as well, but I am looking for distributors in these countries to reduce your costs. I will try my absolute hardest to charge the lowest shipping, including shipping from fulfillment centers within those countries or regions when possible. Due to unknown factors that can affect shipping costs, I can at best promise to warn you via update (and email) what the real costs will be prior to charging you. And of course you will be given the opportunity for a refund if you wish. I apologize, but I will also have to reserve the right to refund any pledges that I don't think my shipping partners will be able to fulfill. I will reach out to you directly if this becomes necessary. \nHere are the countries my shipping partner won't deliver to. I can still try to ship there directly, but I can't make promises you will get your packages in a timely or cost-effective manner: Afghanistan, Brazil, Congo, Ivory Coast, Democratic Republic of Congo, Eritrea , Guinea-Bissau, Haiti , Iran, Iraq, Liberia, Libya, Myanmar (Burma), North Korea, Russia, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Ukraine\nThank you. -Joey\nIf you want FREE SHIPPING for GROWL then go to Kickrock.it/growl, get a unique sharing link, and convince a friend to buy the game.

Wouldn\u00b4t it be cool to have a solid glass sphere with the structure of the Universe inside it? The success of our previous campaign \"The Universe in a Sphere\" showed us: Yes! But not only that, we got many requests if we continue making these spheres and if we plan to add more variants. We realized quite fast, that the Milky Way is a must have, especially if you already own the Universe in a Sphere. \nIn this sphere, every one of the 300,000 tiny dots represents an entire Galaxy. Due to the Milky Way being represented by only a single dot within the Universe Sphere, the vast amount of stars per Galaxy is hard to understand.\nNever mind, human can try do understand, so we decided to create a collection of Spheres. We want to go from huge to small, with the Universe in a Sphere as our our big bang, continuing with the Milky Way in a Sphere and only stop if you say: Please stop it, we don\u00b4t need more beautiful glass Spheres. \nHoping, that this will never happen, we already worked on many Ideas like The Sun in a Sphere, The Solar System in a Sphere, Elon Musk\u00b4s Tesla in a Sphere, The Earth in a Sphere, Bacteria/Virus/Molecules in a Sphere, DNA in a Sphere, Atom in a Sphere. So stay tuned and now:\nLet\u00b4s start with \"The Milky Way in a Sphere\"...\nHexgrid Base, LED Set, Round Base\nIf you google the Milky Way, you will find many beautiful pictures, fantastic animations and pretty decent maps. But after some research, you realize, a lot of it is artwork. \nTo make it short, it\u00b4s because a Galaxy is so stupendously huge, that it would take approximately 1,000 years with the speed of light, alone to reach a point from where you might see the other end of our Galaxy. If you stay inside it, you can\u00b4t see the forest for the trees. Especially the center is so crowded and bright, that you have no chance to see through...\nThis sun, our sun, seems to have around 200,000,000,000 brothers and sisters. Two hundred billion stars that rotate with a speed between 20 and 200 kilometers per second in the shape of a giant disk. There are 1 million times more stars in our Galaxy, than dots in one Milky Way Sphere.\nThe diameter of the disk is\n150,000 light years (1,400,000,000,000,000,000 km) and it is\n2,000 light years thin (190,000,000,000,000,000 km). Our closest neighbor is the star Proxima Centauri, which is apProximately 4 light years away (37,000,000,000,000 km). In these dimensions, movement is hard to notice and you can easily forget, that it\u00b4s only a matter of perspective and time .The sun circles the Milky Way every 220 mio years...\nPLAY\n\nVideo:(http://beltoforion.de/article.php?a=spiral_galaxy_renderer, music: Unicorn Heads)\nHow do we know, what our Galaxy looks like?\nWe will answer this question, right after the break, in which we show you, what you get if you support this campaign and why we need you.\nWhat do you get?\nIf you support this campaign, you can choose between \"The Milky Way in a Sphere\", \"The Universe in a Sphere\", different bundles, 3D printed bases and an LED Base plate. You can get the LED Base plate by simply adding 10 \u20ac to your pledge. It has different changeable color sets, but does not rotate the sphere. \"The Milky Way in a Sphere\" is still in progress, but the first prototypes and the previous Spheres are already convincingly beautiful. \nThe Milky Way in a Sphere V1, The Universe in a Sphere, Gift Box and Flyer.\nWe will offer the most favored bases of our previous campaign in order to prevent having 300 different variants to pack, like last campaign. If you want a special material or color we do not offer, you can visit our shop at\nhttps://www.shapeways.com/shops/cinks-labs  \nwhere you can order our bases (you will not be able, to buy the LED base plate there). Shapeways is a 3D printing company with its seat in Europe and the US.\nRound Base, Hex Grid Base, LED Base plate, LED Fitting Base + LED Base plate\nLED Base Plate + LED Fitting Base, The Universe Sphere on the LED Base Plate, different colors and materials of 3D printed bases.\nNow we want to lay the groundwork for future campaigns and designs, as well as we want to finish our second Sphere, \"The Milky Way in a Sphere\". We asked a friend, who leads a company for movie post-production, to help us and he has done some awesome work. Together, we designed the second prototype, which looked so impressive, that we are super hyped for the next projects. \nThe two prototype stages\nHow is the Milky Way measured and how much can we see?\nWe wanted to get the data for the Milky Way in a Sphere as detailed and true as possible, so we looked up, how the Galaxy was measured and who did it.\nWe found out, that the ESA (European Space Agency) sent the satellite Hipparcos into space, to map out the stars between 1989 and 1993.\nThat\u00b4s a while back, we thought, there must be more recent data...\nThe ESA sent another satellite in 2013, the Gaia mission, which revealed first data in 2016. We downloaded the data, opened it in excel and wondered, why there are no x-y-z coordinates? After some research, we noticed we have to transpose the data. Longitude (l), Latitude (b), Parallax, geometry, we had to remember the good old school days, learn something new and voil\u00e0, after several hours we were able to calculate our x,y,z.\n\nDistance = d=1/Parallax\nX = d*cos(b)*cos(l)\nY = d*cos(b)*sin(l)\nZ = d*sin(b)\nDoes not look like the Milky Way that much\nWhat do we see here? After some research and a phone call with a professor of the University of Astrophysics in Potsdam, our guess became true, it\u00b4s only a fraction of the whole. That fraction is pretty good measured, but again, the forest for the trees. With that knowledge, we found visualizations of the Gaia data and we became sure, we need more data to design the Milky Way.\nCredits: X. Luri & the DPAC-CU2. Simulations based on an adaptation for Gaia of the Besan\u00e7on galaxy model (A. Robin et al.) https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/gaia/iow_20110810\nSo we looked up more data. We found different infrared data, stellar density data, data catalogues like tgas and hyparcos, pictures, photos and we built the first prototype. It looked good, but not awesome. Every dot had the same size and the arms were hard to mention.\nWe hired Ronald and his company \u201cBASIS KG\u201d from Vienna, Austria and together we took our images, datasets and 3D models to create the second prototype. \n\"First, we concentrated on the stars in the arms and made them more visible and highlighted. After that, we selected the data from the bright star clusters and gave them more volume by adding stars. Next was to bring the stardust and all the asteroids into the Sphere and we decided to phase them out from the center to the edge\"\nAfter several hours of work we finally got the result and were so impressed, that we instantly ordered our prototypes...This is the first footage of our new Sphere, but we might improve it and its production  during the two month of our campaign.\nStretch goals\n100.000 \u20ac - The Milky Way in a pocket cube At 100.000 \u20ac we want to add the option for tiny glass cubes containing the Milky Way, that cost only 10\u20ac. \n200.000 \u20ac - The big sphere At 200.000 \u20ac we want to add the big 15 cm sphere, which still needs more development\n306.970 \u20ac - Designed product packing \nAt 306.970 \u20ac, the finish line of our previous campaign, we want to hire a company for professional packing, so the bases and spheres fit inside one designed box.\nThe prototype of the big sphere vs. the regular sphere. We will make another campaign for the big sphere, because it needs more development.\nHow is it made?\nTo show the laser etching process, we made a video of a cube, because it is better to see.\nThe Pocket Milky Way\n   The Pocket Milky Way 3x3x1 cm\nTestimonials", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLike in the past campaigns, it\u00b4s still necessary for us to produce a larger amount of spheres, to lower the production costs and make it affordable for many people. We have learned, that there will always be costs you can\u00b4t predict and we were really happy, that the initial campaign was such a huge success. \n\nWe also had some trouble with our shipping service provider, who messed up 3000 tracking codes, falsely rejected 200 packages because of the batteries. At the end, we delivered all these Spheres, but this cost us quite some time and nerves. Nonetheless, we are more than confident, that we will also overcome any future hurdles. \n\nTogether, we successfully finished two big campaigns on Kickstarter, but we are still only two brothers, who are in the progress of building their company.

You\u2019re staying at one of the three major establishments in Deadwood where you and your associates are working together to steal some of the gold-filled safes floating around town. But you suspect that the \u201cfriends\u201d you\u2019re working with are secretly plotting to keep all the gold for themselves. Will you be ready to turn on them before they shoot you in the back?\nDeadwood 1876 is a social deduction game where you'll work with teammates to find and collect gold. But in the end, the team with the most gold will have to fight each other to the death to determine the winner! Will you spend your turns helping your team find gold, or preparing to defeat your own teammates in the Final Showdown?\n2-9 Players. 20-40 minutes. Ages 13+.\n1 Magnetic book box\n1 Faux leather pouch\n1 Rulebook (includes character biographies and Deadwood history)\n3 Wood carved platforms\n9 Wood star pawns\n10 Wood engraved dice\n79 cards (9 Characters, 20 Safes, 50 Deadwood)\nThe game comes in a magnetically-closing faux book. Extra room is provided in the center section should you desire to sleeve the cards.\nThe wood establishment platforms conjure the look of an old western storefront. Since each platform is stained and laser cut, the wood grain and color will be slightly unique in each copy of the game. The platforms are laser cut in the negative space, so each letter and design comes outwards.\nThe ten wooden dice each use custom designs instead of standard dots. Each colored dice corresponds to a gun in the game and has different values depending on the gun. Each die is colored and engraved.\n Nine wooden stars act as the pawns in the game.\n The dice and stars come in a faux leather bag.\nThe 9 characters are based on people who actually lived in or visited Deadwood in 1876. Character biographies are included in the rule book. Each character card is colored on the front, and black and white on the back.\nThe 20 Safe cards are designed to look like genuine safes from the 1870's.\nEach of the 50 Deadwood cards contains a gun on top and a special item on the bottom.\nIn Deadwood 1876 you\u2019ll use cards from your hand to try to win Safes from other players. Safes contain Badges, Gold, or Showdown Guns. Near the end of the game, players with Badges get extra turns. After the final turn, the team with the most Gold will advance to the Final Showdown. There, teammates will have to fight each other to the death using Showdown Guns. The last person alive is the winner!\nNote: The video above gives a brief overview of rules. Strategy tips, rule clarifications, advanced optional rules, card descriptions, and character biographies are all included in the game rule book. We currently have rules available to view in English, German, French, Italian, Spanish and Dutch on our website. You can also view the contents of this page in Chinese.\nValuable items are hidden behind each Safe. You won't know which Safes have been shuffled in, so every round will play out differently.\nEach player always has 4 Deadwood cards in their hand. You'll get to play one card from your hand each turn, and then it will be replaced from the deck.\nEach card can either be used as the gun listed on top, or the special item listed on the bottom. The Holster lets you help out teammates, the Stetson lets you view hidden Safes, the Horse lets you abandon your team for a different one, and the Duster lets you improve your hand of cards.\nThe more powerful guns, such as the Messenger, have higher values on its dice, whereas worse guns, such as the Pepperbox, have lower values and zeros on its dice.  For shootouts you'll need to manage your hand and decide when to use a powerful gun and when to gamble with your weaker guns.\nEach player takes on the identity of one of nine people who actually roamed the streets of Deadwood.\nA game in progress.\nThis game requires teamwork, but also actively punishes you if you play too nice. That balance makes every round insane. - Sam J.\nMix strategy with the best and the worst of the Wild West, and you get Deadwood. - Charlotte C.\nThe strategy never gets old and I consistently find myself playing with new options every single game. -Spencer H.\nBackstabbing has never been so much fun. This game keeps you on your toes. It is not one you can play half-heartedly. -Abigail S.\nThe more I play Deadwood, the less likely I am to trust other players. When I trust them too much, they take my gold and shoot me with a gun they stole from me. I always regret it. -Patti S.\nIntrigues of Deadwood 1876 video from Beasts of War.\nA great game (in our opinion), needs three things: solid mechanics, an awesome theme, and beautiful design.\nMechanics\nDeadwood is a balance between teamwork and selfishness. If a player uses all of their best Deadwood cards and Badges to hunt down Gold for their team, they\u2019ll be defenseless to fight against their teammates in the Final Showdown. But if a player only goes after Showdown Guns and saves all of their best cards, their team might not have enough Gold to actually reach the Final Showdown. If someone on your team doesn\u2019t seem to be pulling their weight, they\u2019re probably plotting to use your Gold to reach the Final Showdown and then destroy you! There may come a point when you need to attack, mislead, frame, abandon, or banish your own teammates.\nTheme\nWhen we were searching for the city for the 3rd Volume in the Dark Cities Series, we fell in love with Deadwood almost immediately upon learning about it. Large deposits of gold were discovered in the Black Hills of South Dakota in late 1875. Word quickly spread about the gold and the town of Deadwood was born almost overnight in early 1876. It soon reached a population of 5,000 miners, gamblers, prostitutes, outlaws, and businessmen. Lawlessness was prevalent as people flocked to the town to find (or steal) their share of the gold. Deadwood quickly became an infamous western town where old west legends lived and died.\nThe book has a raised UV effect so that all designs and logos pop out from the cover and spine.\nDesign\nThe illustrations from Sarah Keele and graphic design from Holly Hancock take players into the world of the wild wild west! We used wood and leather textures with our components, old west Victorian charm with our book and character cards, and cards that look like antiqued metal Safes built by the \"Facade Safe & Lock Co\" similar to Safes from the time period. The goal of our design is to take you and your friends deep into the raucous, chaotic, exciting world of Deadwood, South Dakota in its prime. You can view time-lapse videos of Sarah illustrating Molly Johnson, Solomon Star, Seth Bullock, Kitty Leroy, and the Holster.\nWe've already made many \"premium\" choices for the game (wooden platforms instead of cardboard, faux leather bag instead of plastic, wooden star tokens instead of standard pawns, faux book instead of standard box, etc.), because we believe in publishing awesome games regardless of funding amounts. But if we reach the following milestones, we'll be able to make Deadwood 1876 even better!\nNote: Some of these upgrades will be exclusive to the 1st Edition of Deadwood 1876. Backing on Kickstarter is the only way to guarantee that all upgrades listed above will be included in your copy of the game.\nWe've been working hard on logistics all year and for this campaign we're very pleased to offer free US shipping at all reward levels, and low international shipping rates. We are also using fulfillment companies around the world so that you won't be charged extra customs fees. If you are mistakenly charged customs fees when the games arrive, just let us know and we'll pay you back. (For EU backers, we will be shipping games from Germany so you won't have extra customs fees)\nBecause of cheaper shipping, we\u2019re happy to be selling Deadwood 1876 at prices that are even cheaper than the early bird levels of our previous two Kickstarter projects!\nDeadwood 1876 is Volume 3 in the Dark Cities Series! Each Volume is a stand-alone game that comes in the same sized faux book box, focuses on a particular city and year, and includes a dark or mysterious element in its game play. \nVolume 1: Tortuga 1667 (Published 2017 thanks to Kickstarter!). Click the links to view the original Kickstarter campaign or our website. Tortuga was recently nominated as the best party game of 2017 by Board Game Geek!\nVolume 2: Salem 1692 (Published as \"Salem\" in 2015 thanks to Kickstarter! Second edition published as \"Salem 1692\" in 2017). Click the links to view the original Kickstarter campaign or our website.\nBoth of our released games have sold over 20,000 copies and are now played around the world! We're already hard at work on Volume 4, and we will continue expanding the series. We know your game closet is a mess. Start your bookshelf collection of games with the Dark Cities Series! See Add-Ons section below for details.\nIf your pledge includes at least one copy of Deadwood 1876 then you can add an unlimited amount of Tortuga 1667, Salem 1692, or extra copies of Deadwood 1876 to your pledge! Just add the indicated amounts below to your pledge amount without changing your reward level. After the campaign we'll send out a survey where you'll select which games you'd like to be added to your order based on how much extra money you pledged. If you have any questions, please see the FAQ section or shoot us a message.\nYour shipping cost does not increase at all regardless of your location or the amount of add-ons you order. You will receive all add-on items at the same time that all of the Kickstarter rewards are received (estimated delivery October 2018).\n Examples:\nYou are outside the US and want 2 copies of each game. Select the $43 reward level and pledge $129 ($43 two-copies reward level + $6 reward level int'l shipping + $40 two add-ons of Salem + $40 two add-ons of Tortuga).\nYou are in the US and want 6 copies of Deadwood, 1 copy of Salem, and 10 copies of Tortuga. Select the $110 reward level and pledge $300 ($110 six-copies reward level  + $20 Salem add-on + $170 Tortuga large group add-on). \nIf you want Deadwood and Salem, Deadwood and Tortuga, or one of each game, we have reward levels available for those options.\nOur illustrator Sarah Keele wants to turn you into a Dark Cities character! During the campaign Sarah is offering a limited number of discounted custom portraits in her shop! We will then turn this portrait into a card that you'll be able to use during game play in your copy of Deadwood 1876!\nCustom Character Cards are also available in her shop for Tortuga 1667 and Salem 1692. Discounts are also available in her shop during the campaign for other art from the game.\nFollow her instagram for other giveaways and discounts.\nWe will send a survey to the email associated with your Kickstarter account on April 10th using the CrowdOx pledge manager system. You will be able to choose your add-on orders and provide your shipping information at that time. If you change addresses before we ship your rewards, you will be able to access your survey at this link anytime after April 10th: https://app.crowdox.com/retrieve/travishancock/deadwood-1876-a-safe-robbing-game-of-teamwork-and\nGame creation and graphic design is by Facade Games, owned and operated by Travis and Holly Hancock (and our little cheerleader Margo).

This game would not exist without your ideas, feedback, and criticisms. Thank you!\nWe fell in love with the Kickstarter community when we launched our first game, Salem. We had another great experience with the launch of our second game, Tortuga 1667. The feedback, support, trust, and positivity from the community was incredible. We're proud to reward our Kickstarter backers with discounts on the very 1st edition of the game, the lowest shipping costs we can offer, first-in-line knowledge and insight into the project, and a direct line of communication to us as the creators. We also take your feedback into account before launching production. We consider each Kickstarter backer to be a close ally in our game-making endeavors and we'll do everything we can to protect your trust in us.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs you can see from our photos, samples of the game have already been produced by our manufacturers and designs are complete. We just need to raise the funds and say go! We will do everything in our power to achieve on-time delivery, and we will reach out concerning any unforeseen circumstances. Our first two projects, Salem and Tortuga 1667, were delivered on time to backers as promised. \n\nSalem: \"I have backed over 46 projects and I just wanted to say this project has been an absolute delight to have been a backer for. Your updates have been insightful, but not overbearing. You clearly put a lot of time, thought, and effort into this game and it really shows. I was impressed with how fast this project came together. It was a fast, well organized campaign. Kudos to you and thank you for a wonderful end product. I couldn't be happier.\" -Snuffles00\n\nTortuga 1667: \"I backed this and another project that ended a day prior at the same time as my first kickstarters. The way things have gone with the other project have given me an even greater appreciation for not only the great game you made, but the well executed Kicktarter.

We were lucky to have the backing of over 6,000 awesome fans worldwide.  We released the retail edition in late 2017 and then something unexpected happened.  It sold out instantly and started going for ridiculous prices on the secondary market.   Then our backers started raving about the game online.  Tom Vasel of the Dice Tower named it one of his top 5 games of 2017 and we were awarded with 4 Golden Geek nominations including strategy game of the year, thematic game of the year, best artwork and presentation and overall game of the year.  It's been a wild ride for Dino Island since it was first unleashed on the world just a few months ago.\nDinosaur Island has been sold out since about the moment it went on sale and we've heard the constant calls to make the Kickstarter exclusives from the last campaign available again.  And we've been listening.\nDinosaur Island is a hot new game from designers Jonathan Gilmour (Dead of Winter) and Brian Lewis; from Pandasaurus Games with amazing, technicolor, ridiculously 90s artwork from Kwanchai Moriya and Peter Wocken.  \n1-4 Players; 60-150 minutes (scalable length regardless of player count), ages 10+  \nIn Dinosaur Island, players will have to collect DNA, research the DNA sequences of extinct dinosaur species and then combine the ancient DNA in the correct sequence to bring these prehistoric creatures back to life. Dino cooking! All players will compete to build the most thrilling park each season, and then work to attract (and keep alive!) the most guests each season that the park opens. Do you go big and create a pack of Velociraptors? They'll definitely excite potential guests... but you better make a large enough enclosure for them. And maybe hire some (read: a lot of) security. Or they WILL break out and start eating your guests\u2014and we all know how that ends. You could play it safe and grow a bunch of herbivores... but then you aren't going to have the most exciting park in the world (sad face). So maybe buy a roller coaster or two to try and attract guests to your park the good old fashioned way?   \nThe X-treme editions are a chance for us at Team Pandasaurus to add some really fun stuff to Dinosaur Island that we can't afford to include at retail.\nFor the base game, that means bringing back almost all of the stretch goals from Dinosaur Island 1.0.  The Dino Meeples, new slimmer metal coins, researcher Beaker Meeples and all of the Kickstarter exclusive plot twists (Purple Die, VIP Meeples, Extra Hooligans) that weren't able to include in the retail edition of the game for cost reasons.  Oh, and a brand new slap-bracelet first player marker that is exclusive to the X-Treme edition.  And of course, spot UV and metallic ink on the box lid!\nAnd for backers of Dino Island 1.0?  As a thank you, any backers who jump into this new campaign for either Duelosaur or Totally Liquid will get the new slap-bracelet as a free thank you for supporting us a second time around!\nFor Duelosaur Island and Totally Liquid it means a new X-treme edition box with spot UV box, metallic ink box and stretch goals that we can't afford to include in the retail editions of these games.  These will be Kickstarter exclusive editions that will not be available at retail, so grab 'em now!\nUpgrade Kits: For those of you who may already have a copy of Dinosaur Island and want an upgrade kit (all the X-treme edition goodies minus the exclusive Spot UV/foil cover art), we are going to offer that after the end of the campaign during the backer-kit or you can add 30 dollars to your pledge now per upgrade kit you want.  These are only available as an add-on item to another pledge tier and will ship when those items are available.  \nWe've been asking players what they wanted from a Dinosaur Island expansion for the last year+ and have been listening, working and testing (and testing, and testing) and Dinosaur Island: Totally Liquid is the result!  We'll be revealing Water Dinoz, new extensions and executives throughout the campaign so keep your eyes glued here for new content!\nAnd yes, we have been listening.   Introducing Moriya Labs, the 5th player expansion for the game!\nDinosaur Island: Totally Liquid adds lots of cool new mechanisms to the game on top of a 5th player setup.  The Blueprint Module gives all players bonus points for following the plans laid out on the card!   \nThe Park extension gives players a new extension to the board that gives them a unique way to score points and unique mechanics to explore separately from all other players.  The Executive Worker gives each player a unique worker to their corporation that acts completely differently from any other worker in the game.  \nBelow you see some examples from Mega Rex who is a really hard to make dinosaur (2 of each advanced DNA!) and is extra dangerous, but the guests love him!  Build seating and up to 8 guests will come to see him!   The CFO worker gives you a new way to make money by placing him on an item in the marketplace and gaining the payment for yourself instead of the bank!\n And we're just getting started.  PR events will be introduced during the campaign along with additional Executive workers and Park Extension boards!\nCheck out all the shmancy components in Totally Liquid!\nPandasaurus Games is proud to announce a brand new stand-alone 2 player sequel to Dinosaur Island: Duelosaur Island!  \nDesigned by Ian Moss and developed by Dinosaur Island designer Jon Gilmour, Duelosaur has completely unique mechanics that make it an amazing experience that is sure to add to anyone\u2019s collection.\nDuelosaur Island brings back a lot of the same feeling that players loved about Dinosaur Island, but introduces an entirely new hand-management tableau-building engine that is unlike anything you\u2019ve seen in Dinosaur Island, and a really tense \u201cI cut you choose\u201d dice drafting mechanic.  The first-player will roll the DNA dice and give each die a different bonus, with the second player choosing the DNA to take first.  So, do you give the DNA you want the best bonus and risk your opponent taking it?\nDuelosaur is built around a clever hand management mechanism. Each card in the game serves 3 potential purposes. They contain the DNA sequences for dinosaurs you could create, the blueprints for attractions you can build and also are discarded to take certain actions. Do you create the Dinosaur on the top of the card attracting guests to your park? Or do you build the attraction on the bottom of the card, which can grant PR bonuses, income and end-game VP? Or do you discard the card to combine DNA towards creating another dinosaur. Duelosaur Island comes with 5 brand new full-color \u201cDNA dice\u201d. You can mix and match dice between Dinosaur Island and Duelosaur Island for even more variability in both games. Adding a copy of Duelosaur Island to your collection is going to unlock lots of cool new possibilities in Dinosaur Island like the brand-new security symbol that can appear on dice to upgrade your security level instantly! Mixing these dice in with the Dinosaur Island dice is a great way to add replayability to both Duelosaur Island and Dinosaur Island.\nDinosaur Island Rulebook\nDinosaur Island: Totally Liquid  Alpha Rulebook (non-final layout, non-final text)\nDuelosaur Island  Alpha Rulebook (non final layout, non-final text)\nPandasaurus Games will be working with partners to deliver the game worldwide. This project will be EU, Canada, China, US and Australia friendly!  \nAfter the campaign ends, we will be charging actual shipping costs. We want to strike a fair balance of value for our backers while ensuring high quality fair shipping prices for each backer. By shipping within the EU, Australia, China, Canada and the United States we are hoping to get as favorable of shipping rates as possible. We will be working with well-vetted partners in each region who have experience with Kickstarter reward fulfillment and come highly recommended by other publishers within the industry, and will take into account good (and bad) experiences that other publishers have experienced.  \nOur goal is for the average shipping costs for backers in the EU, US, Canada, Australia and China to be under 20 USD with shipping for backers outside of these regions to come from the most cost-effective area for the lowest possible shipping price.  \nBackers in some regions, especially the Middle East, Africa, South and Central America may experience high shipping fees which reflect the actual cost of shipping to these areas in excess of 50 USD. Please be aware of this before backing the project.\nWe are proud to partner with Quartermaster Logistics, the premier provider of Kickstarter fulfillment in the gaming industry. Your games will be safely packed by their professional team, and you\u2019ll be emailed a tracking number when your package ships. Learn more about Quartermaster Logistics at qmlogistics.com\nSplitting Shipments\nAfter the campaign ends, we will allow backers to split shipments of titles so that they ship as they become available.  This will be up to individual backers if you wish to get games earlier or wait for all items to become available to ship together to save money.   \nFor example if you pledge for the base game + Totally Liquid we expect the base game to be available this Summer while Totally Liquid won't be ready until the Fall.  You may choose to split the shipment to get the base game first or you can wait until both are ready to ship to save on shipping costs.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nPandasaurus Games is a 6-year-old board game publisher who has delivered hundreds of thousands of board games worldwide. We are confident in our ability to deliver the rewards listed and on time.\n\nDuelosaur and the base game are art complete and set to begin the pre-proof process with the printer during the campaign to ensure timeliness. Totally Liquid is 80% art complete and will finish during the campaign. Short of a production issue with some of the bespoke components, delays in shipping or issues with proofing that require reworks, we intend to release the game on time. We will always choose quality production over timeliness, so delay of the game is possible, but we will be ready to hit the printer with final components right at the end of the campaign.\n\nThere is the chance of delay in shipping or customs that is largely out of the control of our company, but we are experienced in moving products through customs. Of course, with multiple freight solutions going to various parts of the world it's possible some regions will get the game more quickly than others. Our goal is to ship the game as soon as it lands on any continent, so we'll have to ask for your patience if some regions get the game before others.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 35 or more", "title": "Duelosaur Island X-Treme Edition", "descp": "Pledge for the brand new stand-alone 2 player game Duelosaur Island!\n*Shipping charge is done at the end of the campaign (see shipping section for details)\nINCLUDES:\n1 copy of Duelosaur Island -

This is the nature of manufacturing complex and innovative products. In our case, possible delays may be associated with shipping, customs, and manufacturing.

We have budgeted an ample time frame for this tooling.\n\nWe have gone to great lengths to source reliable manufacturing options and set attainable timelines.

You've had it with your day-job and set out to open your own caf\u00e9 in the beautiful, diverse and thriving city of Berlin. Competing against other rival caf\u00e9s, you set out to be the best, no matter the cost!\nIn Seize the Bean, players compete to get the most good reviews by the end of the game. They do so by successfully serving customers in their line. Each turn will provide them limited actions which they can use to attract certain types of customers, gain resources, or even boost their actions for more effective results. By looking for opportunities in the ever-changing city, the players can take the right products and upgrades and build up their shop and clientele to victory.\nCustomers form the heart of the game, providing you with those precious points (good reviews), although potentially the most problems too (bad reviews). Each group of customers represents a Berlin archetype and has their own needs, wants, and abilities. A typical game of Seize the Bean will use 6 of the groups, giving you the potential to customize the city and play a different game every time!\nThe 10 base customer groups are: Hipsters, Tourists, Musicians, Party Animals, Start Uppers, Cyclists, Students, Funemployed Expats, Starving Artists and Performers.\nCurrently, with stretch goals, we\u2019ve unlocked all of the additional 15 customer groups (depicted below): Street Freaks, Tech Nerds, Rebels, Criminal Minds, Authority Figures, Families, Health Nuts, Upper Class, Fashionistas, Media, Friendly Locals, Coffee Connoisseurs, Boardgame Geeks, Boardgame Media and Quality Beasts.\n(Please note that the final two groups, Boardgame Media and Quality Beasts, are promotional add-ons that are not included in the retail base game.)\nThe so-called \u201cchrome\u201d bits of the game are the life-sized coffee beans, miniature milk cartons and hyper-realistic sugar cubes (really, you will want to eat them\u2026 but don\u2019t!). In our prototypes we\u2019ve modeled and 3D printed these ourselves, locally in Berlin, but for a manufactured version we\u2019ll be going with resin, thanks to our unlocked stretch goals!\nMost people think the gimmick of the game is the scoop we\u2019ve demoed at events. However, this was added in order to make the acquisition of beans go faster and be more manageable in the game. In the end, it turned out to be quite a source of enjoyment for our play-testers! (Please note: plastic cups are not included in the game.)\nPlayers earn points for good reviews and negative points for bad reviews. Each review has a fun, thematic message attached, bringing some of the real-life social networking to the game. (Many of our backers will be providing the messages on these reviews!)\nAll cards are 75x50mm in size and will be 300gsm ivorycore with professional grade aqueous coating. The tokens will be 700gsm greyboard with a top and bottom layer of 300gsm including matte varnish, while the dual-layer player boards will have a 400gsm top layer. The beans, milk and sugar cubes will be poly-resin. The barista meeples will be machine cut wood that\u2019s painted, varnished and silkscreened on both sides. The rulebook will be 128gsm gloss paper and the box will be 2mm greyboard wrapped in 157gsm gloss paper.\nWhat to read more? CLICK HERE to see his full review!\nWant to read more? CLICK HERE to see his full review!\nPlayers will take their turns over the course of a game day, serving their customers, taking actions with their barista meeples and acquiring new customers through word of mouth, based on what products and upgrades they have built into their caf\u00e9. At the end of each day, players draw customers from their deck to their line.\nWhen serving, players pay the required (and sometimes optional) resources to earn rewards, activate the customer\u2019s unique ability, and avoid earning a bad review!\nWhen taking actions, players can acquire new resources as well as select customer, product and upgrade cards from the city (the central card pool) to add to their caf\u00e9. These actions can be enhanced by product and upgrade cards.\nWhen applying word of mouth, players can only attract customers who like the products and upgrades they have built into their caf\u00e9. The trick here is that even if a matching customer is not wanted it still must be taken! \nGameplay continues until a set amount of good reviews have been earned, at which point the players take a final turn where they can only serve their customers.\nDon\u2019t like reading rulebooks?

We\u2019d of course need the rulebook to be translated and we\u2019d also love to make unique boxes for each language. We\u2019ve priced this out and we added stretch goals for the foreign language versions.\nWe are proud to say that we are offering backers the choice of an English, German, Spanish or French edition of Seize the Bean!\nOur publishing partner, The Wood Games, will be running a campaign for the Chinese version on February 20th, 2018.\nWant Seize the Bean in another language?

This is a Kickstarter project for an expansion to my hit board game The Networks. \nNot familiar with it? That's okay! Here's a website where you can learn more about the base game, and here's the Kickstarter project from 2015 where over 2,700 generous backers pledged over $100,000 to make it a reality.\nThe Networks is now in its third printing. It's been printed in Chinese, there's a German version in the works, and more languages are on their way. \nLike what you see? If your friendly local or online game store is sold out of The Networks, the base game is available from this campaign.\nYou'll need a copy of the base game to play The Networks: Executives.\nAnd now you're all caught up!\nSo you\u2019ve proven your worth in the past. We know you can run an ordinary TV network. Big deal.\nWe have a bigger challenge for you. Here are 12 unique Network Executives, each with their own weird characteristics. Every Executive has powers, but they also have significant liabilities. Can you master each Executive\u2019s idiosyncrasies, draft the best Season 0 cards, claim your true status as a Mogul, and come out on top?\n           The Networks: Executives adds three major components to The Networks: Executives, Season 0 Cards, and Mogul Cards.\nThe Executives are the biggest addition to the game. The expansion comes with 12 Executives in the box. Each one will significantly change the way you play the game by giving you a set of distinct powers and liabilities.\nYou can play as Flix, which turns your network into a streaming service that lets you consider all your Shows as being in their proper time slots... but every time you switch genres within a time slot, you lose Viewers.\nYou can play as Beeb, which turns your network into a state-run enterprise that tends to generate revenue. But because you now have a lot of bureaucracy to deal with, you must use a rondel to choose your actions.\nYou can play as Telethon, which turns your network into a public broadcasting network. You may not hold Ads in your Green Room. But you may hold a telethon once per season to ask other players for money, in exchange for powerful Sponsorship Tokens. If they don't give you money, you get to keep the Sponsorship Token to use yourself.\nAnd so on. With all the Executives in the game, the amount of challenge and replayability grows enormously. \nThe Season 0 Cards are a new way to begin the game. Instead of everyone starting with similar Shows, Stars, and Ads, you will now begin the game with a draft. Everyone starts with a hand of 4 Season 0 Shows, and chooses one as their 8 pm Show. Most Season 0 Shows get you Stars, Ads, and/or Money, but have no genre and give you no Viewers. Others have a genre and Viewers, but get you nothing else.\nOnce you've selected your 8 pm Show and received anything it gives you, you'll pass the remaining 3 Season 0 Cards to the player on your left and receive 3 cards from the player on your right. Everyone will now choose their 9 pm Show, and so on.\nThis starting draft ensures that players begin the game with completely different setups. Some players may begin with a stocked green room, but no Shows with Genres. Other players may get shows with Genres to get a head-start on their Genre Bonus, but with little in their green room.\nWhy is the race to a Genre Bonus important? Because of the third addition to the game: Mogul Cards. These are effectively supercharged Network Cards. At the start of the game, you'll deal out a number of them to the table equal to the number of players plus one. These will be the only Mogul Cards available in the game; you will not replenish these between Seasons.\nYou get a Mogul Card by either getting your first 5-Show Genre Bonus, or your second 3-Show Genre Bonus. You can no longer draw Network Cards or trade in money for Viewers after a 5-Show Genre Bonus, but some Mogul Cards still let you do that. \nMogul Cards even out some lategame swinginess present in the base game and give players a long-term goal to shoot for.\nWith these three huge additions to the base game, The Networks becomes a much deeper and more replayable game!\nWant to know more? Here's a draft of the rulebook for the expansion!\nWant to try it? If you have a copy of the base game, here's a free PNP of the expansion! \n    \"If you ever thought what your damp, shoddy, and structurally unsound public access TV station experience needed was to give more attention to the equally shoddy and unsound eccentricity of its management, then you're in luck! Because that's what Executives is all about.\" - Cardboard Republic\n\"The Executives adds a ton of variability and exciting new strategies to the base game! The wide array of player powers and Season Zero starting options makes every player's game feel unique with interesting and challenging decisions. The addition of Mogul cards give players powerful rewards to work towards, and the new shows inject welcome new content for regular players. More than an essential expansion, The Executives is a reward for Networks fans!\" - Danielle and Jake Bock, Draft Mechanic\n\"When we played it was obvious that this expansion gives The Networks a ton of replayability. This is totally an expansion you need if you like the original game.\" - Gameosity\n             \"...The Networks is a well crafted card-drafting game. The game remains engaging throughout the entire playing time, and the escalating strength of the three Show decks gives a nice trajectory to the strategy/scoring.\" - The Opinionated Gamers\n\"This is the perfect medium-weight game... I\u2019m impressed with what Gil Hova has done in The Networks and look forward to seeing how it will do on Kickstarter. He\u2019s made a solid game with a great sense of humor. And yes, it was difficult to cancel \u201cAn Hour of Shouting\u201d, but it didn\u2019t bring in the viewers I needed. There\u2019s no room for sentimentality on the Networks.\" - Indie Cardboard\n\"The Networks is, quite literally, my favorite Euro-style game. Gil Hova has done what many have found unthinkable, combining a deep economic game of resource management with sharp humor and an incredibly engaging narrative. It's a perfect blend of mechanism and theme. It is, in short, UHF: The Euro Game. And you need it in your collection.\" - Your Moderator Chris, Flip the Table podcast\n\"If you're looking for some lighter fun with a backbone, and fantastic dad puns, you can feel good spending an hour of your table time with it... I think Gil's game is smart, well-designed, and it sneaks in a challenging game under the cover of humor.\" - Heavy Cardboard\n\"With screwball humor and well-developed mechanics, this game offers both charming flavor and solid design. The Networks is basically UHF: The Board Game. It encourages you to excel at the inanity of television programming on the one hand while lambasting it on the other, and yet this charming mix of motives adds up to a game that\u2019s amusing and strategic all at once.\" - The Cardboard Republic review (Awarded the Seal of the Republic!)\n\"The Networks is a thoroughly enjoyable card game. Deciding when to develop new shows and drop existing shows, as well as what time slots, who will star in them and what advertising to use is surprisingly fun. The game plays fast, is easy to teach but has many tough decisions. I cannot wait to see what potential additions come about from stretch goals for this game\u2019s Kickstarter campaign.\" - Board Game Quest\n\"All-in-all, I really enjoyed The Networks. It is approachable, funny, and smart all at the same time. I know that this is a game that I can bring out with newer gamers because they will have a blast with the theme, yet I can also bring it out with more hardcore gamers due to its subtle depth. Gil Hova of Formal Ferret Games has created an impressive gem; One which points to a bright and successful future for this indie publisher. I can\u2019t wait to see what kind of cards and new ideas will make their way into future expansions. Any game that can make me want more while still feeling like a complete and final product has something special going for it.\"- Meeple Mountain\n\"This is a winner. I want one. We're actually going to fight over this copy.\" - Punching Cardboard\n\"Overall, The Networks was done beautifully and kept me wanting more... kinda like my yearn for reality television, but much less guilty this time around.\" - Indie Tabletop\n\"The Networks is simply an extremely well-designed game... and the gameplay is just so solid. Maybe it\u2019s true that there\u2019s nothing good on TV, but, quite frankly, with The Networks, I\u2019ve already got plenty of entertainment at my fingertips.\" - Gameosity\n\"Like an episode of Game of Thrones, this game is addicting and leaves you wondering how the last 60 minutes flew by so quickly. The Networks is must-see-TV and I highly recommend you check it out.\" - League of Nonsensical Gamers\n\"...it\u2019s strong in all its elements \u2013 theme, gameplay, strategic challenge, accessibility, length, graphics, humor \u2013 across the board, making for a fantastic game that\u2019s greater than the sum of its already solid parts. A game of The Networks is more fun than drinking from the fire hose, and in the end, fun is what it\u2019s all about.\" - Up With Meeple\n  At this pledge level, you can stay subscribed to updates about the game.

I heartily encourage you to consider buying the base game from your favorite game store. You'll support their business, and you'll be familiar with the base game by the time The Executives arrives at your door!\nIf you're in Australia, New Zealand, Denmark, Norway, or Iceland, please back the game at the Executive Int'l Vice President level, which will offer a reduced shipping rate!\nThis pledge level gets you one physical copy of The Networks base game, one physical copy of The Networks: Executives, one physical copy of The Networks: On the Air, and all PNPs. \nIf you're in Australia, New Zealand, Denmark, Norway, or Iceland, please back the game at the Executive Int'l Vice President with bonuses level, which will offer a reduced shipping rate!\nThis pledge level contains everything that the Executive Vice President+ pledge level gets you, PLUS you get to name an Executive!\nHere's how it works. Each Executive is double-sided, with a female figure on one side and a male figure on the other. Each Executive has a stock name for their power, e.g. Mr./Ms. Rich, Mr./Ms Cheapo, Mr./Ms. Telethon, and so on. But at this level, you'll supply us with the Executive's real name, like \"Martha Higgenbottom III, Esq.\" \nYou're welcome to choose your own name, the name or nickname of a friend or loved one, or a fictional name you just think sounds cool. I will have veto power over all names, though, so please don't submit anything off-color or unpleasant!\nThis pledge level contains everything that the Executive Vice President+ pledge level gets you, PLUS you get to name a Network!\nHere's how it'll work. There are 5 player boards, just as in the base game. These player boards will be divided into a Network Name board, showing the name of your network and your player color, and an Executive board, reminding you of what powers you have.\nThe Network Name boards will be double-sided. The existing network names from the base game (U62, VCK, PKW, ICS, and MOO) will still be on one side of the board, but the name you select will be on the other, along with a brand-new design.\nI will have veto power over all names, though, so please don't submit anything off-color or unpleasant!\nWant more copies of the game? You can add them on here!\nI will be using a pledge manager called BackerKit to help manage add-ons. So while you can pay for these add-ons by increasing your pledge, you can also wait until the campaign ends. Either way, you'll submit the add-ons when you give me your mailing address. Then, if your pledge isn't enough to cover the add-ons, BackerKit will prompt you to cover the difference. \nI used BackerKit in my previous campaign for Wordsy, and I found it made my job exponentially easier. Hopefully it will help you out as well! \nNote that all these prices are without shipping. I will calculate add-on shipping costs closer to the end of the campaign.\nYou can order an extra copy of The Networks base game for $50 extra, plus shipping.\nYou can make it a 3-pack (add 2 copies of The Networks base game to your pledge) by adding $90 to your pledge.

Instead, they'll be packaged in external expansions that will be available once the expansion is out in stores.\nThis means the stretch goals below are not exclusives. However, they will be tougher to get ahold of than the base game or expansion, so this is your best opportunity to pick them up! \nCOMPLETE! At $30,000, the project has been officially funded. Hooray!\nCLEAR! At $40,000, all backers pledging $29 and up will now receive 20 clear plastic cubes to replace the black timing cubes from the base game. A lot of people who play The Networks like to place their timing cubes directly over the number of viewers they're getting that season, in case they have a show on at the wrong time slot. Transparent cubes will make that a lot easier!\nCOMPLETE! Meet the Gorilla! At $50,000, all backers pledging $29 and up will receive a 13th Network Executive.\nThis character is the 800-pound gorilla. When playing, you will get extra money at the start of each Season ($2M per player in the game), and extra Viewers at the end of the game (1 Viewer per player in the game). The downside? You go last every Season, regardless of your score. Quite a challenge!\nCOMPLETE! Meet Continuum! At $60,000, all backers pledging $29 and up will receive a 14th Network Executive.\nThis character is a time traveler! Once per Season, you may spend money to run your time machine to take two actions on your turn. If you don't do that during the Season, you may run it at the end of the Season to consider one of your Shows as being in its proper time slot.\nWhen you run your time machine, you'll take an Anomaly card and put it on top of the Star Deck. Any player who gets that card, either through drawing from the top of the Star Deck, or in the following Season, when the card becomes one of the Stars available to Sign, puts it in their Green Room. You can spend an Anomaly to get two actions on your turn.\nCOMPLETE! At $70,000, we will give each Network Executive its own logo! This will make them easier to distinguish from one another.\nI have a signature up there, but they won't necessarily look like signatures. Rich may have their name written in diamonds, Butcher will be sharp and maybe drip something red, and so on. It's going to look cool!\nCOMPLETE! OK, this one is exciting. At $80K, I'll provide replacement scoring markers in all colors that will replace the squares that came in the base game. These scoring markers will look like cute little TVs! And they'll still stack nicely like the original discs.\nNote that the image above is just a mockup; they will not necessarily look exactly like that, but it's the spirit of what we want!\nCOMPLETE! ...and here's the companion to the $80K stretch goal! At $90K, I'll provide replacement turn order marker in all colors that will replace the discs that came in the base game. They'll look like little remote controls!\nNote that the image above is just a mockup; they will not necessarily look exactly like that, but it's the spirit of what we want!\nAt $100K, you'll get a new Season Marker that will replace the current one. It's going to look like a TV tower!\nNote that the image above is just a mockup; they will not necessarily look exactly like that, but it's the spirit of what we want!\nWhen I launched this Kickstarter, I was going to ship out the base game along with Executives, in the same package. But at $125K, I will be able to manufacture the base game first, get that on a cargo ship ASAP, and deliver it to you in a separate package a few months before Executives!\nIn a week or two, I will have a better estimate of when I can fulfill the base game if we reach this stretch goal. Right now, it's looking like we can deliver it no later than April 2018, possibly sooner.\nThis stretch goal will only affect folks who pledge at $75 and up. \nAt $150K, all backers who pledge $29 and up will get all starter Shows, Stars, and Ads from the base game, with special rules on how to incorporate them in Networks: Executives!\nThis stretch goal has been requested by a few backers. I had to figure out a way to smoothly incorporate them into the experience, but after some testing, I think I have it.\nAll Starter Shows will now all be gray \"no-genre\" cards, but will have the same names and art as from the base game.\nIMPORTANT - If you are in Australia, New Zealand, Norway, Iceland, or Switzerland, and you want to back at the $29 or $35 levels, make sure you pledge at the International Executive or International Executive with Bonuses levels. Those will give you better shipping rates!\nNote that there's a slight omission in the pledge level bullet points for the International Executive pledge level. There should be a bullet point for a physical copy of the On the Air expansion.\nFor this campaign, I am providing a $7 discount on shipping for all backers. This won't reduce your shipping cost to $0, but I hope it will take most of the sting out of the shipping bill.\nIf you're backing in Canada, you will not have to pay any extra charges beyond shipping. All rewards will ship from Starlit Citadel, based in Vancouver.\nIf you're a customer within the EU, your rewards will ship from within the EU. This means people who live in EU-member countries will not have to pay VAT. Hooray!\nKeep in mind that some countries like Switzerland are physically within the continent of Europe but are not EU members. If you're in a non-EU-member nation, you may still have to pay customs, taxes, or import fees on your package.\nIf you are in the EU and choose either the $29 or $35 pledges, your package will not be tracked by default, as that increases shipping costs significantly. If you fall into this category and prefer your package to be tracked, message me and we can work something out.\nOne more note on current events: At the time of this campaign, the UK is still part of the EU. The current plan is to ship all EU rewards (including UK rewards) from the UK. \nIt's unlikely that will change by the time of fulfillment, but if it does, I will send UK rewards from within the UK and EU rewards from a different fulfillment center within the EU. \nEither way, if you are in the EU right now, you will not have to pay VAT!\n   Gil Hova - Game Designer\n Travis Kinchy - Illustrator\nHeiko G\u00fcnther - Graphic Designer\nKickstarter Page Graphic Design\nDaniel Newman\nMain video voices:\nEthan Hova\nGil Hova\nBrodrick Jones\nCarrie Margulies\nJosephine Stewart\nMain video animation:\nBen Shulman, Jellybean Soup\nMain video music:\n\"Magic Forest,\" \"Enter the Party,\" \"Eighties Action,\" \"Surf Shimmy,\" \"Egmont Overture (Beethoven),\" \"Malt Shop Bop,\" \"DarxieLand,\" \"EDM Detection Mode,\" \"Teddy Bear Waltz,\" and \"Lost Time,\" by Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License  ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nBoard games are hard to make! Anyone who's used Kickstarter to back a tabletop game can tell you about projects that funded but delivered late... if at all.\n\nI've been designing games for a long time, and I now have three successful Kickstarter projects under my belt: The Networks' base game, Wordsy, and Bad Medicine. And by \"successful,\" I don't just mean that they funded. All of my projects have shipped to backers around the world within a month of the estimated ship date.\n\nI've backed enough projects to know what tends to go wrong with a tabletop campaign. Here is what I'm doing to make sure The Networks: Executives will not be delayed.\n\nFirst: Game design and graphic design are mostly done. This game is less than a month away from being ready to be sent to the manufacturer. In fact, I will begin the pre-production process with my manufacturer during the Kickstarter campaign, which should save us some time.\n\nSecond: One lesson I learned since the original Kickstarter campaign for The Networks was a better understanding of manufacturing and quality. Since then, I've switched manufacturers. Ever since the second printing of The Networks, I've used Panda Games, one of the biggest and best-known hobby game printers in the world. I've also used them for my game Wordsy. They deliver incredibly high-quality products on time.\n\nThird: I will be using several board game fulfillers to deliver The Networks: Executives to the US and most of the world. That leaves shipping in the hands of people who can send packages safely and quickly, and who understand that tabletop games require more packaging than other products. \n\nFourth: I am using a company called OTX to handle the logistics of transporting the manufactured games from the plant in China to the warehouse in the US. This is an intricate process, but OTX is quite used to it, and they specialize in board game logistics. I've used OTX to deliver two printings of The Networks and the first printing of Wordsy, so I know they're reliable.\n\nFifth: I've backed plenty of Kickstarter projects, some which delivered on time, some which delivered late, and some that never delivered at all. I learned a lot from each of them.\n\nAt this point, I'm familiar with just about everything that can go wrong in a Kickstarter. Believe me, failing to fund is not even close to the worst-case scenario! I've heard many stories, from artists never delivering their art, to pallets stolen at the port, to mold in the game boxes and snails in the shipping container.\n\nBut I've built a great team around me. I feel that I am prepared to deliver this product to you close to my estimate of July 2018.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Viewer", "descp": "Thank you for keeping an eye on the campaign!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2017"}], "stat": ["84 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 2 or more", "title": "Business Partner", "descp": "This level is only for retailers!

Don't panic! Click the image to be automatically directed to where you can order Overworld!\n  Overworld is a competitive tile-placement, territory control, and exploration board game for 2-4 Players with a 1-player Solo Quest Variant! It was designed by Nemo Rathwald for ages 14+ and plays in about 30 minutes. The most beautiful thing about Overworld is its elegance in simplicity; it takes only 5 minutes to teach but mastery will only develop after many, many plays.\nIf you enjoy games like...\nCarcassonne\nAlhambra\nTakenoko\nTsuro\nThen Overworld should especially resonate with you!\nIn Overworld, players act as explorers piecing together bit by bit the map of the Overworld by placing specially designed interlocking tiles drawn from a bag onto an expanding world map and adding your explorer tokens onto any new tile you explore. The interlocking teeth will only allow you to place your tiles in legal locations, making gameplay very smooth and easy to learn. \"IF IT FITS, IT'S LEGIT!\" \nEnclosed gaps will eventually form in the landscape, and in these gaps are where elusive Dungeons are discovered. Discover the Dungeons furthest apart from one another and control the most territory with your explorers riding Umbirds and Ships to win!\nOverworld is the second installment of our Super Nano Enhanced Series, which began with Fire of Eidolon (shipping now worldwide!) This project will undergo several ENHANCEMENTS during the campaign which will upgrade the components and content of Overworld, and can be unlocked via Backer total Stretch Goals, Funding Stretch Goals, and Social Media goals, which will all be explained in detail below.\nEVERY BACKER MAKES A DIFFERENCE! Overworld is mechanically like a Euro-game but is also highly thematic and heavily inspired by the 16-bit era of Role Playing and Adventure video games of the 1990's. It is visually stimulating and loaded with stylistic parody and in-jokes that fans of retro videogames will appreciate while still being accessible and wholly enjoyable by everyone all within a unique, original, and compelling game that stands entirely on its own. We started the Super Nano Enhanced Series with Fire of Eidolon and we continue the tradition as you explore that world in ages past...in Overworld!\nOverworld came to Magic Meeple Games as a fully complete publish-ready game called Mirage which had been nearly published by another company before coming to us at Origins a couple years ago. We absolutely loved Mirage and saw an opportunity to re-theme the game to fit into our Super Nano Enhanced Series. With a new title and theme, Overworld has been under iteration and development for years and we feel it is finally ready for everyone to enjoy!\nEasy to learn and teach, difficult to master, immersive theme, and a new board every time you play!\nHere are some of the features you'll find in this game and in our Kickstarter campaign:\nGreat Gameplay! - High praise from reviewers, gamers, convention-goers of all ages for Overworld! \nHigh Replayability! - Overworld uses a brand new PUZZELOCK TILE SYSTEM and is never the same game twice! Procedurally generate the world as you play to make every game a brand new story!\nHigh Accessibility! - Overworld uses a very simple set of rules has an extremely gentle learning curve and is extremely easy to pick up and play! The game can be taught in about FIVE MINUTES and after playing a few times will players begin to understand the depth that Overworld offers!\nBacker-only Discounts! - After all Enhancements from this campaign, Overworld will have an MSRP of at least $35.99. Our Backers can get it right now for just $25 no matter how much content is added on through Enhancements and Stretch Goals! That's a savings of nearly $11 per copy!\nENHANCEMENTS! Stretch Goals! Achievements! - Your pledge WILL make the game better! Together we will make it awesome! Every backer matters!\nInteractive Kickstarter campaign - Throughout the campaign we will make decisions about Enhancements and features based on the feedback YOU provide in our update polls! Leave your mark on tabletop gaming history!\nSimplest Bundle Pricing on KickStarter! - Order as many copies of Overworld as you want at $25 each and pay shipping only for the first one! Just add $25 per extra copy and enter the total at the pledge confirmation screen. Boom. Done. No spreadsheets. No tricks.\nCustomer Support - It is our duty and honor to put your concerns at ease throughout the ENTIRE production process. Frequent updates during the campaign and no less than one update a month post-campaign until delivery. If you have a question or just want to say hello, reach out to us!\nand now for something NEW:\nMONEY-BACK SATISFACTION GUARANTEE - We're borrowing a page from Stonemaier Games and offering a Money-back guarantee with the Overworld project! Within one month of receiving Overworld, if you're unhappy with the product and customer service you've received, just send the game back to us and we'll issue a full refund of your original pledge!\nNemo Rathwald's Puzzelock Interlocking Tile Design solves the #1 problem with tile-placement games!\n  Did you run out of play space? You can actually move this board and everything stays IN PLACE!\n  Questions? We're here to help! We aim to have 24-hour or less response time to all inquiries during the campaign!\n \nSuper Nano Enhanced Series games undergo many ENHANCEMENTS throughout the campaign, many are achieved like normal Stretch Goals, but some are special and will require involvement in the comments or on social media!\nHave a look at what we'e accomplished so far!\n      Click the image to visit our Twitter page!\n  And click HERE to visit our Facebook Page! \n  Measure the X/Y limits of your map and calculate your score much faster with this handy tool!\n  Towns and Sidequests now part of the Overworld package!\n  LINEN FINISH NOW INCLUDED!\n  You asked for it, and we've been saving it for the epic finish! Can we reach this high?\n    Your turn in Overworld is 4 simple steps: \n                                           Draw a Land Tile (from the bag) \nAttach it to another tile on the board (IF IT FITS, IT'S LEGIT!) \nAdd Explorers to the Tile you added (one per segment, Umbirds for land, Ships for Sea) \nResolve Gaps! (Check for Dungeon discoveries!)\nJust how easy is it to play Overworld? Have a look!\nThe game will begin with a single Coastline Tile on the board. Begin your turn by drawing a Land Tile from the bag.\n  You may choose to place the tile LAND side up or SEA side up, as long as there is a place to connect it where the teeth fit without obstruction. IF THE TEETH FIT, IT'S LEGIT!\n  After placing a Land Tile, place three of your Explorer tokens on it, Umbird tokens explore LAND, and Ship tokens explore SEA. Each player gets seven of both to Explore the Overworld!\n  Yellow's turn is over, play continues in this way as Red and White each get a turn...until a gap is created into which no other tile can fit, then a Dungeon is discovered!\n  Dungeons are Discovered by counting up all of the Explorer tokens belonging to each player in all regions connected ORTHOGONALLY to the gap. Yellow has the most Explorers connected to this gap and gets to claim the Dungeon discovery.\nExplorer tokens (Umbirds or Ships) that are used to Discover a Dungeon (i.e. those belonging to the player that had the most and placed their dungeon door in the gap) are returned to that player to be used again, the others stay on the board!\nTake note that player White placed the tile that gave player Yellow that Dungeon! This is a very important tactic that you will need to deprive your opponents of territory!\nIf there is a tie, the player who placed the tile gets to decide who breaks the tie and gets the Dungeon Discovery. \nPlay continues until no more tiles remain in the bag, then scoring begins.\nEND OF GAME\nYou collect points for the Explorer tokens you still have in play, and the total distance of the shortest path (in Orthogonal spaces) around all of your Dungeon doors in play, door-to-door-to-door. Like this:\n  Click here to see the complete End Game scoring ruleset!\n    CURRENT GAME CONTENTS:\nThis list will change and evolve as we unlock Stretch Goals and add Enhancements! \nBox & Rulebook - Similar size and style as a 16-bit video game's box and manual!\n32x PUZZELOCK Land Tiles - Double-sided and Die-cut with our special Puzzelock design that physically prevents invalid tile placement. \"IF IT FITS, IT'S LEGIT!\"\n28x Umbird Tokens - Basic funding goal will make chipboard tokens, Enhancement goals will make them laser cut meeples!\n28x Ship Tokens - Basic funding goal will make chipboard tokens, Enhancement goals will make them laser cut meeples!\n12x Dungeon Door Tokens - Basic funding goal will make chipboard tokens, Enhancement goals will make them laser cut meeples!\n4x Quick-Reference/Faction Cards - Poker-Sized Cards - Never forget a rule or which color belongs to which player with these handy Quick-Reference/Faction cards! THANK YOU TO OUR DAY-1 BACKERS!\n1x Tile Bag - For randomization of tiles, through Enhancement goals, this could become a luxurious drawstring cloth bag with an embroidered design!\nExtra Zip-Lock Baggies - To carry everything and keep it organized!\nEXPANSION CONTENT PLANNED - To be revealed via Stretch Goal Enhancements. Planned content includes: Solo play and more than one Mini-Expansion!\nBONUS! Every copy of Overworld sold here will include an exclusive promo for our previous project, Fire of Eidolon! Thank you to all of the backers that helped us get here today!!\n  Throughout the campaign we will add additional goals to meet beyond our base funding goal. Each of those goals we achieve will add another ENHANCEMENT to Overworld. Some of these Enhancements will behave like traditional Stretch Goals which most are familiar with, but some will be different and put more focus on Backer Participation.                       \nThere are several ways to help support the Overworld project, here is more information about each available Pledge level to help you decide how you can support our project!\n                                                                                                                                                                                              Not enough Reviews for you?

Optimized sheets now consume 15% less ink!\n  WE NEED YOUR HELP!\nThe best thing you can do to help improve Overworld is to back our project. The SECOND best thing you can do to help Overworld is to spread the word and share our campaign on all of your favorite Social Media sites! Here are some fun social media avatars you can use to help express your fandom! Collect them all!\n      Or, use this to make your own and we'll post it here!\n  Increase our total reach by FOLLOWING Magic Meeple Games on Twitter!\n  Visit us on Facebook and LIKE our page to help us unlock additional ENHANCEMENTS!\n       Adding additional copies of Overworld to your Pledge will not incur additional shipping charges in this campaign. Add $25 to your Pledge for each extra copy if our built-in Pledge levels do not suit your needs. We will discount every pledge down to charging shipping on only the first copy of Overworld in each order!*\nRewards for this project will be shipped primarily from the USA. Distributor/Manufacturer may collaboratively ship some rewards from other countries to save on shipping and customs costs. For the Fire of Eidolon project, we ultimately opted for a combination effort using Amazon and SFC (Ship from China) as many highly successful Kickstarter projects have done and the results have been favorable!\nRather than lock ourselves in to a specific method of shipping, we analyze the order distribution at the time of manufacturing to find the most cost-effective and time-effective distribution options available to us. This is our commitment to you in our goal for constant process-improvement and to provide the best possible products that we can!\n*Shipping price is for delivery of one entire order to a single address. \nResidents of Brazil, Russia, and South America take note: to ensure your package is delivered, additional charges may be required to ensure delivery verification in certain regions of these countries. If these additional charges are not paid, the chances of lost packages in those regions increases sharply and our distributor is attempting to implement solutions to this problem. If you reside in any of these countries please inquire about your pledge before the end of the campaign as the $20 basic shipping charge cannot guarantee delivery in these countries. \nRegarding Customs: Our shipping partners offers what they call \"Customs-Friendly Worldwide Shipping\" meaning they coordinate all transport, customs clearance, and brokerage from the factory to the destination using shipping depots all around the world. They have already laid the groundwork to ensure all packages will make it to backers in every country as smoothly and inexpensively as possible. If any VAT taxes or customs fees would apply to your order, we make sure those are pre-paid to make it easier for YOU! \nWhile we cannot personally guarantee that no single person will have any customs difficulties on an individual level, we are confident in our ability to mitigate any potential issues and keep surprise costs far away from our backers and their ability to make it right should any such problems arise. We have had very few individual cases of customs difficulties and the processes have improved even more since those challenges have occurred. If all of our efforts still do not meet your expectations, you are still protected by our Money-Back guarantee! Pledge with Confidence!\nDelivering your reward responsibly\nOur primary goal and responsibility as Magic Meeple Games is to deliver the rewards that our backers pledge for, at the level of quality they expect, and as quickly as possible. Magic Meeple Games and its partners have years of collective experience overseeing planning and production to ensure Overworld well be delivered to all backers in a timely manner. \nSo far, Magic Meeple Games has produced and shipped two feature projects. Darkrock Ventures, which has fully fulfilled; and Fire of Eidolon which has been partially fulfilled already and will complete fulfillment before this Kickstarter campaign is complete.\nWe have run into slight speedbumps with each of these projects which hinged on the final completion of graphics. We can be proud of the fact the amount of delay was reduced dramatically with the fulfillment of FoE as compared to DRV, but we can do better. This time, we have a fully graphic-designed rulebook completed IN ADVANCE for everyone to enjoy which means we won't be waiting on it before manufacturing. This project focuses on the physical components of the game and less on artwork, this will also help us accelerate our manufacturing process and get the game made that much faster.\nIn fact, it is our goal to enter manufacturing on this project by October, and ALREADY have prepared art, graphics, and rules all in advance to make this a realistic goal. We are challenging ourselves to make Overworld our best-record for delivery, we have laid out even more groundwork ahead of time and together we can make this possible! Thank you for your support!\nWe do not plan to use use the built-in survey system for the Overworld Campaign, after the Kickstarter campaign ends, we will use PledgeManager to manage your orders and give everyone one last opportunity to add on to their pledge. There are no separate or hidden Add-Ons during the Kickstarter campaign, only the pledge levels. \nIf you'd like to add additional copies of the game to your pledge beyond what is available in the reward tiers, or if you would like access to the special FoE Backer price on our previous projects, Fire of Eidolon and Darkrock Ventures, you will be able to do so within PledgeManager after this Kickstarter campaign ends. (PledgeManager will charge backers separately for any additional products added beyond what was pledged for in the Kickstarter.)\n    Seven hundred playtests. Two laser cutters. Twelve BoardGameGeekGold. Six Pez dispensers. The heat of a thousand suns. Boardgame designer Nemo Rathwald has most of these things. \nNemo's game design goals are:  \nInteresting choices\nLittle downtime\nLots of gameplay from as few rules as possible \nMultiple viable paths to victory \nComponents that physically don't let you break rules, so you don't have to remember them.\nNemo started searching the shelves for boardgames which turned out to only exist in his imagination. So he started making them so he could play them. He got into game design in 2003, at the first Penguicon (a convention of all geeky interests) and has been helping to run the convention ever since, where he playtests new board games of his own design every year.\nIn 2010, Nemo discovered i3Detroit hackerspace, a nonprofit community workshop with an educational mission in art and technology, where he volunteers as a Board Director, an Officer, and an Instructor. There, he upgraded his ability to make lavish show-stopping board game prototypes. Due to his experience in publishing, he fully illustrates and preps his games and rulebooks for pre-press in advance. In 2013 he changed careers from graphic design to web development. In 2014 he signed his first board game publishing contract at Protospiel, a convention for board game designers. \nNemo Rathwald carries a wheeled suitcase of board games in the trunk of his car at all times.\nHere is an unboxing video of our last production, Fire of Eidolon, so you can see the standard of quality we aim for with our projects!\nMagic Meeple Games, LLC. is a tabletop publishing company based in Phoenix, Arizona. By gamers, for gamers, we are Magic Meeple the Boardgame People! \nFounded, co-owned, and operated by a husband/wife team; We are passionate, lifelong tabletop gamers and we want to show that passion through the games we choose to design, develop, and publish. In our first campaign, Gamelyn Games partnered with us to elevate Magic Meeple Games to their level of quality and customer satisfaction straight out of the gate and we upheld that standard as we moved forward with our first solo campaign, Fire of Eidolon! Now we return for our THIRD Kickstarter project with hopefully many more to come.\nMagic Meeple Games origins began in the industry in 2007 through independent game design, company co-owner Ian Stedman is a published designer himself and has worked on several projects for several other publishing companies as a consultant and designed Magnum Opus for Clever Mojo Games. \nThis is the third core entry into our publishing catalog, and we drawn from the experience of designers, developers, publishers, distributors, manufacturers, and retailers all over the world. We would not ask for your pledges if we were not confident in our ability to fulfill the obligations we have set forth for ourselves. We have worked hard to hone our craft and learn everything necessary to produce quality games at competitive prices and at last we have the tools we need to do so. Now, we need your help to make it all real! Our customers are our #1 focus and we are honor-bound to provide the most friendly & prompt service and communication we possibly can. \nPlease do not hesitate to contact us on Twitter @MagicMeeple, find us on Facebook.com/MagicMeepleGames, send us message directly on Kickstarter, or you can even email me directly at ian@magicmeeplegames.com!  \nYou can learn more about Magic Meeple Games HERE.  \nMost of all, we want to thank each and every one of your for your belief and support in this project!

It is prone to many surprises and problems, even for experienced publishers. \n\nFortunately our team is comprised of exceptionally experienced and talented individuals, with years of expertise in Game Design, Game Development, Print Publishing, Product Manufacturing, Project Fulfillment, Art, Technical Documentation, Retailer Support, Retail & Online Sales, Technology Support, Retail sales, and Graphics Design.\n\nWe co-published our first project, Darkrock Ventures, with the collaboration of the exceptionally experienced Gamelyn Games, and that project was a SUCCESS. Our first solo project, Fire of Eidolon was also a SUCCESS. We at Magic Meeple Games are proud to say that we are prepared for the task at hand and have even more experience and knowledge in our corner with successful fulfillment of board game projects.\n\nOur previous project fell a couple months short of our target Shipping date, and we have identified several contributing factors to that delay and have actively made improvements in our process to prevent the likelihood of such delays happening again.\n\nFor this project, we are focusing on a game which came to us very much complete. Additional features have been added and small tweaks have been made here and there, but suffice to say, the game is already finished and manufacturing-ready. All that is left is to put in the add-on content that is unlocked in the campaign, update the already designed fully-graphical rulebook (something that has been a challenge in the past) and send off the files. We have never been in a better position to go straight-to-print.\n\nWe are also expanding our horizons as we seek manufacturing and distribution, we are adapting to find better solutions to save time and money, this began by working with Discover Gaming Fulfillment with the distribution of Fire of Eidolon. Thanks to them, most of our backers have already gotten their rewards!\n\nDuring the manufacturing of Darkrock Ventures there was a technology failure that caused a delay that we could not control. This is just an example as things such as this cannot be helped no matter how prepared you may be. No project is immune to the possible mishap, but this road is familiar to us, our distributors, and our manufacturers and we are confident in our ability to deliver our products to our backers and fans. \n\nThank you for your confidence and support!\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAbove all, We are 100% dedicated to customer service and backer communication. We will be transparent with our process, and involve our backers as much as possible.\n\nWe will be present DAILY during the project to answer any questions or read any comments and we will provide regular updates and supply photos of the progress when possible.\n\nThank you for your trust in us!

Be sure to keep up with us on our website to see our next project.\nIn this project our scientists have captured the essence of a genuine \"Fog Monster\" and transferred it into a marvelous machine. Now with the flick of a switch you'll see fog creep and crawl across your game terrain creating immersive atmosphere like never before. Prepare yourself for new gaming adventures in mysterious Fog!\n  Easy to use, just add water and watch as the fog creeps across your terrain! (Dwarven Forge Sewer terrain pictured)\n\"Fog Monster\" Features:\nColorless - Will not stain or leave an oily residue on your terrain.\nOdorless - No unpleasant burning smell.\nRuns on water - No expensive formula or \"juice\" to purchase.\nCool low lying fog has the same creeping effect as dry ice.\nLong lasting - Over 3 hours of continuous fog (Fog Monster version).\nAdjustable volume - You control how much or how little fog you want. The longer it's on, the denser it becomes.\nInstant - Fog instantly begins pouring out when it's turned on and stops when it's turned off.\nPLAY\n\nWhich Monstrous Fog Machine Should You Buy For Gaming?\nIt depends on your game play. There are two Fog machines in this project for two different playing styles. Both machines use the same internal components to make fog.\nThe first machine is the \"Fog Monster\" which uses a pipe system to deliver the fog into your game. This design allows you to hide the pipe behind your existing terrain pieces so that the fog enters like it is part of the natural environment.\nThe second Fog Machine is the The \"Dark Crypt\" Fog Machine. The Dark Crypt is meant to be placed in the game terrain and produces fog that exits through the doors and windows.\nUpdate: Smaller clear pipes system now available in the Fog Works Pipe Pack Add-On , see the prototype video below.\nOther Uses for the Fog Monster Fog Machine:\nPhotography\nFilm\nSpecial FX.\nPLAY\n\n How Does It Work?\nWith the simple turn of a switch the Fog Monster will immediately begin producing Fog. Fog Monster uses an ultrasonic transducer that atomizes ordinary water and turns it into a cool dense fog that rolls across your game terrain with creeping, crawling ground effects. (Technical explanation of the process found here.)\nNOTE: For players with wood, card game tiles and boards, paper or cardboard terrain. Fog is humid air. Fog will cause moisture build up.  Owners of paper or wood based game pieces should take moisture build-up into consideration before deciding to use fog in game as fog moisture may cause paper or wood based pieces to peel or warp.\nUpdate: Cardboard and wood users please watch the video below for possible compatibility with terrain using our Flexible Tube Kit Add-On.\nPLAY\n\nWe have not found any problems from moisture build up on nonporous game pieces that use water or oil based paints. We have used wax paper under our set to protect any porous, wooden, or cardboard, table top surface from moisture.\nPower Supply input voltage is 110 -250V Compatible.\n  Power Supply input voltage is 110 -250V Compatible.\n   In depth overview of Fog Monster on Dwarven Forge Sewer Terain\nPower Supply input voltage is 110 -250V Compatible.\n    See a Featurette of the Dark Crypt Fog Machine.\n          Fair shipping charges.\nBased on international and domestic requests shipping will be collected  after the campaign ends. This will bring fair pricing to everyone and will not artificially inflate the campaign with shipping costs. You can see these approximate prices below.\nDelivery Options\nIn the USA Some rewards come with free shipping as listed. These will be delivered to our warehouse in the USA by ocean shipping, then shipped by USPS to your address. However, you also have an option for rushed air delivery direct from our factories fulfillment center at the additional cost below. (Note: If you choose express, instead of the free shipping, it will be additional as per below.) Direct shipping from our factory will start once all components are finished and placed in boxes (See approximate shipping times and prices below).\nAll International buyers must choose air delivery direct from our factories fulfillment center as per the pricing below. We have worked hard to get this pricing and save you money. For some the air shipping is cheaper than waiting for ocean shipping. All duties, taxes, and or VAT will be the sole responsibility of the buyer.\n  The prices below are approximate and reflect one Fog Machine only (either plastic or resin). Additional rewards may increase shipping.\n   Stretch Goals\nAs Kickstarters go stretch goals are a great incentive, however the molds required to make them are also very expensive. If a manufacturer were to offer all stretch goals from the beginning they either have to set the project cost very high (perhaps prohibitively) or set it low and take the risk that there will be a windfall of profit to manufacture everything. If there is not they may end up raising just enough money to fund the cost of the molds! This is why we are offering only the fog machines to begin and stretch goals after we have achieved the cost of the molds and production costs.\nCredits: Promotional video music \"With Honor\" (Heroic Score) used under license by Really Slow Motion. - Music \"Reverie\" in Dark Crypt Featurette by Vindsvept.

We formed Real Game FX because we love games and wanted to deliver real world and special effects that we believed would add immersion to tabletop games. \n\n As an experienced manufacturer we looked at the success and failure of a number of Kickstarter projects and saw potential problems that came from offering too much too soon. Additionally we saw that shipping funds being included in the overall funding goal artificially inflate the project as shipping costs do not contribute to covering the actual manufacturing cost.\n\nBy starting the project with only the Fog Machine rewards we know that when the project funds we will have covered the actual manufacturing costs. This assures us all that the project is now funded and ready for delivery to our customers.\n\nOnce we fund past the project amount it then opens up more project rewards and just gets better for everyone since we are then able to get preferred pricing on additional molds from the factory and offer more to our customers.\n\nIn short, we want what everyone wants and that is a successful project. We will use our 11 years of experience in manufacturing, customer fulfillment, and support, to avoid the pitfalls that newcomers often experience.

Over the last year and a half we have loved playing it at conventions and chatting with fans about their best investigations, biggest blunders, and more.\nIn many of those conversations, you told us that you want more. More Means Cards, Clue Cards, Scene Tiles, Events, and Roles. This expansion provides exactly that!\nDeception: Undercover Allies expands the base game by bringing you the following:\nAll of the new cards were designed with a goal in mind of bringing more balance to the Murderer's chosen weapons. We have added many more cards to make the less chosen causes of death (like Illness/Disease) more viable options adding more uncertainty to the game and creating more interesting end game narratives.\nWe've also got a ton of Stretch Goals ready to go to add more fun and charm to a game that so many of our fans love.\nThanks for looking. Thanks for playing. And thanks for your support!\n                                        Add-Ons\nIf you are new to Kickstarter, the add-ons are the most confusing thing in terms of pledging since they do not work on a \"cart\" system like everything else does on the internet. In order to \"purchase\" an Add-on, simply add the cost of the add-on(s) you would like to your pledge amount.\n At some point after the campaign, we will send you an email with a link to the pledge manager, in here you will \"spend\" that extra money you pledged letting us know what add-ons you wanted before we ship your stuff.\nRegional Theme Packs\nInfluenced by Deception fans from all over the world, we've created add-on card packs inspired by regions outside of Hong Kong. Add some local flavor to your game with these Regional Theme Packs! Be sure to check out the various reward levels, some of which include add-ons for discounted prices!\nMarker and Badge Upgrade\nLooking for ways to bling out your game? This is the add-on you are after! Metal badges to replace your cardboard punchouts and plastic (or resin) microscopes to replace the bullet markers brings your game of Deception to the next level.\nSleeves\nEnough sleeves to protect your game. Add $8 for sleeves to outfit the base game (All Role Cards, Means Cards, and Clue Cards). Add $4 for sleeves to outfit the expansion (All Role Cards, Means Cards, and Clue Cards).\nPremium card role deck made by Board Games Maker.  High quality board game printer with capability to print as few as one copy of a game.\n                                                           Click above to read the review!\n            Cost:\nWhile we would love to offer free shipping, there really is no such thing. Shipping is really expensive and we have tried to come up with pricing that accurately reflects our cost to get the game into your hands without creating a logistical nightmare on our side. We expect that we'll have to come out of pocket a bit based on what we are charging and we are ok with that.\nTracking:\nWe will also be using non-trackable shipments in some cases in order to save on cost as tracking can add 30-50% or more in some cases. So please understand if we do not have tracking with your package we did so knowingly. Rest assured, that we will get you your game and any risk associated with not being trackable is on us.\nDelivery time:\nWhile we would love to get everyone their games at the same time, it is just not possible. There is a high likelihood that some areas of the world will get their games before others. Our commitment is to get the games ready and printed as fast as possible (we've already done a ton of the prep work). At the factory we will break out the shipments to each fulfillment company with instructions to them that they should begin shipping as soon as possible upon receipt. In addition, because we have complete control over the U.S. shipments, we will not release the game to retail stores until at least two weeks after the last U.S. shipment has gone out. You will not see the game on Amazon before you have it.\nOther:\nLastly, we will be using fulfillment companies in different parts of the world and while we have done our best to ensure we pick good ones, ultimately, once the games get into their warehouses there is little control we have at that point. We have always done our best to bend over backwards for our customers and if for some reason there are any issues with damages, missing components or missing shipments we will make it right. It just might require some patience.\nWhy back this campaign?\nWhile we have had some great success recently, we are still a relatively small company and we just do not have the funds needed to fund every project we do without some help. Yes, you can wait for this to be available at your favorite online retailer, but we will be including some exclusives that you will not get otherwise and at a price 20% lower than the MSRP of $29.99. Plus, the game should be in your hands long before someone can get it from an online retailer, And finally, we're really nice people - just ask our mothers.\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs a publisher that has brought 10 games to market thus far, we feel confident in our ability to get this done.

Avenue was released at Essen 2016 and the English language version of the game quickly sold out when it reached US stores. We've brought Avenue into the universe of Kodama and added a few twists to make this great game even more enjoyable.\nThe enchanted forest of the kodama is flourishing. But with so much growth, the ancient paths to the sanctuaries within have become overgrown and lost. Now the forest guardians call upon you, their loyal kodama, to restore these paths. Help your kodama build these paths, gather offerings for the guardians, and win their favor. \nKokoro is an exciting family game that can be played with up to eight players (thank you for unlocking the stretch goals)! Each player has a forest map to draw their paths and turns are simultaneous so the game plays quickly. Connecting your sanctuaries to offerings will gain you favor. Choose wisely because you never know exactly when the sanctuary will score. And you shouldn't be too greedy, if a sanctuary is not connected to more offerings than your previous sanctuary, you lose points!\n    And we are very confident that people that enjoy Kodama will love Kokoro, so we are including a special set of Kodama cards in each copy of Kokoro sent as rewards for this project.\nNote - the Kodama & Decree cards shown here are included in the Spirit Compass ($19) and higher Pledge levels.  The Kodama Deluxe Cards are a different set of promo cards (detailed below) and are included in Grove Companion ($26) and higher pledge levels.\nKokoro: Avenue of the Kodama is a game for 2-8 players that plays in 15 minutes. Designed by Eilif Svensson and Kristian Amundsen \u00d8stby, and originally released as Avenue. Kokoro includes all the rules of Avenue, but with dry-erase boards instead of paper scoring sheets. Kokoro also introduces a new \"B-side\" forest map, with a variable set-up that gives you 90 different starting configurations. \nAnd as our first stretch goal, we are introducing a new mechanic - decrees.  Decrees give everyone new path drawing option(s) and/or scoring rule(s) for each game. With the dry-erase boards, random set-up and decrees, you can play as much as you want and always face a new challenge.\nFor more information, we encourage you to view the videos directly below, or simply read our draft rulebook here.\n  These reviews were originally posted for Avenue - Kokoro is the same game, but also includes two expansions with more options to increase replayability. \n                                                  Note that anything marked with these symbols are:\nPromo - an item that Kickstarter backers (and those signed up to get rewards at Essen) will get in their rewards, and will not be included in the retail edition of Kokoro: Avenue of the Kodama. These items may be released at a future date as promotional materials and/or game expansions.\nKickstarter Exclusive - an exclusive item for Kickstarter backers (and those signed up to get rewards at Essen), with remaining stock available through conventions and special promotions only.\nKokoro: Avenue of the Kodama is the 38th project from the combined teams behind Indie Boards and Cards & Action Phase Games. With the successful execution of our first 37 projects, we have become experienced publishers with a reputation for great games (in design and production) that are delivered in a timely fashion. \nKokoro: Avenue of the Kodama is a proven game, Avenue designed by Eilif Svensson and Kristian Amundsen \u00d8stby. We've made this great game even better so you know the game experience you are getting.\nThis game has undergone extensive testing and development to ensure the best possible experience. We are confident that this game will be in your collection for years to come. \nThe game features art from the incredibly talented Kwanchai Moriya (Kodama: The Tree Spirits, Capital Lux, Catacombs, and Dinosaur island). \nAll of the art assets are complete and ready for immediate upload after the project funds. Prices include US shipping. \nThis project is also EU & Canadian friendly.\nKickstarter is the world's largest funding platform for creative projects. Every month, tens of thousands of people pledge millions of dollars to creative projects in dozens of categories. \nA person who supports a project is called a \"backer.\" The process of giving money to this project is called a \"pledge.\" \nIn return for your pledge, we (the creators of the campaign) are able to offer \"rewards,\" depending on the amount you pledge. For example, if you pledge $19 to help back the project, we'll offer you a copy of the game along with any stretch goals we achieve as soon as it is manufactured. \nYou can become a backer in just three easy steps: \nStep 1: Read through the pledge levels and rewards we're offering in the right sidebar of this page. \nStep 2: Click the large, green \"BACK THIS PROJECT\" button to the right of the trailer video at the top of this page. \nStep 3: Enter your pledge amount, and complete the steps for filling in your information. This process takes just a few seconds! That's it! It's really that simple! Thank you for backing! \nOnce you've backed this project, we encourage you to share this page on social media platforms, such as Facebook and Twitter, and share with your friends and family. Also, be sure to like Indie Boards and Cards on Facebook and follow us on Twitter for real-time updates about this project and more! \nFOREST CROSSROADS: (Pledge $1 or more) Thanks for the support!\nSPIRIT COMPASS: (Pledge $19 or more) One copy of Kokoro: Avenue of the Kodama with all stretch goals.

While our current production schedule looks like Kickstarter rewards will ship out before Essen, it may be the case that we have games at Essen before the Kickstarter backer copies are sent. It may also be the case that we are unable to get games to Essen in time. I wish we were able to absolutely guarantee results, but we simply know that we can't make such commitments when so many other parties are involved in the process. \nIf you want Essen pickup \u2013 DO NOT PLEDGE FOR THIS PROJECT \u2013 all you have to do is sign up for the Essen email list by giving an email address here. Shortly before each event, we will ask you what you would like to reserve for Thursday pickup (NOTE: we cannot handle prepaid reservations or hold items past Thursday). \nAll the specials & promo items will be available in the games we bring to Essen \u2013 your support is very valuable to Indie Boards and Cards & Action Phase Games and we look forward to seeing you again this year with lots of great new games. \n                 ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is the 38th Kickstarter project from the combined teams behind Indie Boards and Cards & Action Phase Games. We have learned how to streamline the game publishing process and have successfully delivered all of our previous Kickstarter projects to thousands of supporters. Our previous experiences will enable us to also deliver this project on time and we have every confidence that Kokoro: Avenue of the Kodama will be on schedule and of the highest possible quality.\n\nThat said, there are always complexities and considerations in a project of this scope that may cause delays. Indie Boards and Cards & Action Phase Games will use contract manufacturing to make this game, freight forwarders to get games through customs, and 3rd parties like Amazon, the US Post Office, and FEDEX to ship the games to you \u2013 we don't control everything and there are lots of opportunities for delay. We have a track record of making everything work out for backers in the end \u2013 so please be confident and supportive of our efforts to get this great game into your hands.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nWe can refund you within 14 days of the campaign\u2019s end, fees included. After that, we have a policy of no questions asked, though that\u2019s minus 20% for Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we can\u2019t get back from them after 14 days). However, if we\u2019ve begun packaging your pledge for shipment (usually 4 to 6 weeks before the actual shipping date), no refunds are possible. If a component cannot be delivered AT ALL, we refund that completely, including fees.\n\nAll refunds after the 14 days close of the campaign may be processed via PayPal or reversed via Stripe to your credit card at our discretion. Refunds within 14 days are reversed via Stripe to your credit card.\n\nThis project is being funded in USD and any refunds processed will be in USD for the exact amount received in USD, excluding any applicable fees depending on the time of the refund being processed.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look, materials, and content of the rewards (and the project) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented while the Kickstarter project was active.\n\nIf you do not log in and submit your project survey results (ie, provide us with your shipping address) for your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received.

Our refugee weavers respond well to the challenge of learning this skill.\nFinishing: when a rug is finally cut from the loom after months of weaving, we triple wash the rug using cold water, then press it to ensure it retains its intended shape.\nOver one million knots in this rug have been individually inspected for quality prior to final shipment\nOur Story\nThe Anka Cooperative has already had an extraordinary impact on women\u2019s lives.\nOne of these women is Neriman from Damascus. Neriman is in her early 40s and has six children. Unlike many of her unfortunate relatives, she made it safely to the Adiyaman refugee camp in Southeastern Turkey. Neriman is college educated, and prior to the war she worked for many years as an accountant. But in the camps, of course, there are no accounting jobs, no freelancer websites to apply her trade. Idle time brings painful memories. She jumped at the chance to work at the carpet workshop. It\u2019s a new skill, but she is learning\u2013\u2013and just as important, she is earning.\nNeriman is paid the same as her Turkish counterparts. She is saving to buy gold earrings for her daughters, and hopes to save for a home for when they return to Syria. Neriman represents the 250 Anka weavers who have chosen to make the best of their difficult circumstances, and are the reason Anka exists.\nWhere We Work\nOur workshop in Sanliurfa empowers 25 women in a safe, clean environment\nSanliurfa: The Sanliurfa camp has a capacity 10,000 and a current population 14,000 living in containers. The camp has paved streets, lighting, water, sewer, A/C, and even a TV. It's a secure facility but residents can come and go as they please. The weaving workshop is in an activity center that also houses an art room, restrooms and laundry facilities. We employ 25-30 weavers in a well lit and ventilated hall with windows and A/C.\nNeriman weaves with her daughter after school in one of our six workshop tents in Adiyaman refugee camp\nAdiyaman: The Adiyaman camp has a capacity of 20,000 and a current population 29,000 living in tents. It has paved streets, lighting, water, sewer, A/C, and TV. It's also a secure facility but residents can come and go as they please. The weaving workshops are in six tents. We employ 225 weavers in a well lit and ventilated tents with windows and A/C.\nOur future site in the Gaziantep Refugee camp in S/E Turkey\nComing in 2017, Gaziantep: This campaign will allow us to expand. We have been approached by camp management to expand our training and empowerment model the refugee camp in Gaziantep, Turkey. This expansion will cost the Anka Cooperative over $100,000 for looms, supplies, training, transportation, instruction, etc.\nThe Three Pillars of The Anka Cooperative\nEmpowerment Through Employment: The weavers love their work, not only for the income, but also because it provides companionship and a place to share laughs and to stay active. As a skilled weaver can weave up to 10 sq feet per month, an 9'x12' rug will employ one weaver for nearly one year. Weavers are paid the exact same as Turkish weavers.\nThese women proudly display this rug they crafted for an Embassy in Turkey\nCultural Integration: The Anka Cooperative helps refugees learn traditional Turkish language, culture and customs by learning the craft of weaving and by interacting daily with Turkish teachers. We partner with other charities to expand our reach beyond the refugee camps.\nMany of our rugs will delight children of all ages\nEducation & Awareness: We use our proceeds to support charitable organizations that tell stories of refugees' lives and struggle for dignity. We further strive to share our fundamental belief that empowerment and dignity comes from work, not a handout. We teach women to fish, we don't give them fish.\nTeaching Her How to Fish\n  Rewards  \n$25: Rug Coasters\nReflect on your impact with every sip when you back us at this level\n  $50: Framed Rug Fragment\nShow your support for Anka by hanging this handmade carpet fragment in your home or office\n  $250: Carpet Christmas Stockings\nStunning and meaningful Christmas stockings are made from world class handwoven rug fragments.\n\u2013\u2013\u2013 \nWe have a variety of already woven rugs we are offering as rewards.

While we're thrilled about the possibility of helping so many more refugees, the cost of establishing a new operation is challenging. Kickstarter provides us a unique platform to raise awareness about our approach to sustainably helping refugees.\n\nOur Team \nFatima, Hind and all the refugees we work with\nFatima and Hind both arrived in the Sanliurfa refugee camps almost in 2012.  After a struggle of several months, Hind came to the camp from her hometown of Hama\u2013\u2013a city which dates back to Biblical times. Fatima arrived from Edlin\u2013\u2013this town was one of the first to rebel against the Assad regime. Since they began weaving in 2013 they have become the very best of friends. Both in their mid 30s, the ladies enjoy their work as they laugh and socialize. They represent the 250 Anka weavers that have chosen to make the best of their difficult circumstances. It\u2019s an honor to have them on our team, as they are our reason Anka exists.\nNeslihan, CoFounder and Volunteer CEO\nAs the founder of Woven Legends, Neslihan has been producing high quality, hand-crafted carpets for over 35 years and has won numerous international awards for her carpets which are considered to be among the finest in the world. Neslihan has often been credited with birthing the rug renaissance in 1980\u2019s by exclusive use of handspun wool and natural dyes.\nIn 2012, she approached local officials in Turkey in order to teach weaving skills to Syrian refugee women at the camps. As an American and a native Turk, Neslihan feels a personal and moral obligation to support the Syrian refugees in Turkey. Through Anka, she has pioneered the idea of sustaining their livelihoods by promoting the art of carpet weaving. Her personal rapport with the refugees convinced her that Anka can expand from serving 250 refugee women to empowering 20,000 refugees by 2020.\nNeslihan has one son, Kent, and considers the tens of thousands of women she has empowered over the decades as her many daughters.\nJosh, CoFounder and Volunteer Chief Strategy Officer \nJosh and friends in Sanliurfa camp - Oct, 2016\nHaving lived, worked and volunteered on four continents, Josh brings a global and practical approach to helping fulfill Anka\u2019s mission\u2013\u2013to provide dignity of work, transfer of skills and cultural integration through the creation of traditional crafts.\nDeeply affected by the refugee crisis he saw while working in Turkey, Josh identified ways for US businesses to lend their expertise to help address this humanitarian dilemma. \nJosh is especially grateful of all those who work to support refugee issues. He would also like to thank The University of Notre Dame's Fellow Irish Social Hub and the incredibly supportive ND family!\nThank you for visiting our Kickstarter!  \nActual sketch by Syrian Refugee and the inspiration for our name: \"Anka\" - a mythical bird that which obtains new life by arising from its ashes.\n     ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOur co-founder is Turkish-American and has been training women to weave rugs for 35+ years.

Combine brutal biology, relentless robotics, mind-bending physics and volatile chemistry as you compete to become the most infamous monster-building scientist. The nefarious possibilities are almost endless\u2014the parts in one XYbrid deck can create more than half a billion different monsters. \nEach card is transparent, so building your monster is a creative experience unlike any other game\u2014and because each card has different art on either side, the path to ultimate infamy is always uniquely yours.\nGAMEPLAY\nPlayers take turns drawing parts from the Lab and using them to build monsters that will increase their infamy score. Each monster begins with a core part, and is complete when it has a head, two arms, and legs. Secret Breakthrough cards help players formulate strategies and unleash surprises each round\u2014will you go for brute force or cunning combinations?\u2014while Mission effects raise the stakes as the game goes on. After 3 rounds, the most infamous player wins!\nLearn all the rules with the digital guide, and watch the Learn-to-Play video:\n                          The spirit of the Brand-a-Bot pledge level is to let players put their personal, permanent mark on XYbrid by including their initials in a piece of card art. In science fiction, you often see arbitrary letters and numbers adorning robots and machines\u2014this is your chance to become those arbitrary letters and numbers! Here are the rules:\nYou submit a sequence of up to 3 letters and/or numbers with your survey after the end of the campaign. This can be your initials, or birthdate, or any creative, meaningful group of 3 alphanumeric characters. I handle everything from there. \nI reserve the right to reject a submission for any reason. Some reasons may include: offensive or suggestive content, trademarked content, submissions greater than 3 characters, submissions with special characters, etc. \nIf your submission is rejected, I will work with you to come to an acceptable alternative. \nStylistic choices such as color, font, and placement are at the discretion of the artist. Please know that the goal is to make your \u201cbrand\u201d large and bold (not to hide it within the art).\n  Transparent cards are what make XYbrid a uniquely visual gaming experience. Unfortunately, most manufacturers aren\u2019t equipped to produce transparent cards\u2014it requires special machines, inks, and material. Start to finish, the creation of a XYbrid deck is simply more expensive than it would be for standard paper cards. The basic pledge level of $29 helps cover the increased production cost of making something that looks and plays extra cool.\nThe funding goal of $14,500 is based on close and specific coordination with two manufacturers who provided quotes for producing XYbrid. After factoring in additional fees and shipping estimates, I believe this goal is the most realistic target that allows for a reasonable game price.\nThe pledge levels are simple by design. As this is my first foray into game production, I chose to focus on getting the game itself right, and avoid the added complexity of extra components, perks, or stretch goals. This strategy keeps cost down and removes distractions during the critical production and fulfillment phases.\nFor this project, shipped rewards will come from the United States. While I am happy to send copies of XYbrid anywhere in the world, I do not have distribution partners in Europe or Asia at this time. Please know that customs charges and value-added taxes (VAT) may arise but are different for every country and are the responsibility of the backer upon delivery.\nYou can find more details about manufacturing and delivery in the Risks and Challenges Section below.\n  ABOUT THE DESIGNER\nI'm Gabe. My day job is in graphic design and user experience. I get paid to create things people enjoy interacting with, and over the years I\u2019ve directed more than a few projects that required unusual art production\u2014hence my confidence in bringing a transparent card game to life. I'm committed to understanding how players consume fun\u2014I study what motivates people to engage with, learn, and solve problems; then I use that knowledge to make stuff.\nI've been concocting game ideas since I was a kid, but XYbrid is my first public game design. It grew from my love of modular creativity (my childhood was all Mega Man and Lego) and my love of mind-blowing, weird science. In fact, many XYbrid cards are inspired by real-life scientific concepts.\nMy favorite tabletop games are quick to play, but allow for deeper strategy to develop as players learn. XYbrid was designed, developed, and tested over 4 years to provide this type of play experience, built around a unique visual style. My hope is that Kickstarter will bring people like me together to make this quirky, creative game a reality.\n   ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nMANUFACTURING\nThe concept and vision for XYbrid has been vetted by two proven, global game manufacturers. The vendor I am planning to use for manufacturing is located in Hong Kong, and has assured me that their company can accomplish the printing of two-sided transparent plastic cards. Producing XYbrid as I have described above is contingent on their word and ability.\n\nThe production process will begin almost immediately after funding. With the exception of adjustments for the Brand-a-Bot pledge level, the art for all 116 cards (and the rulebook) is already finished. Box art is nearly finished as well, needing only to be transferred into a technical format for manufacturing.\n\nTIMING\nMy delivery target is November 2017.\n\nThe process for review and approval of products manufactured in Asia can take weeks. I have accounted for a reasonable amount of back-and-forth in the timeline, but errors and/or misunderstandings resulting in unforeseen rounds of revision can extend the production timeline and delay delivery.

Dino cooking!  All players will compete to build the most thrilling park each season, and then work to attract (and keep alive!) the most guests each season that the park opens.  \nDo you go big and create a pack of Velociraptors?  They'll definitely excite potential guests...  but you better make a large enough enclosure for them.  And maybe hire some (read: a lot of) security.  Or they WILL break out and start eating your guests\u2014and we all know how that ends.  You could play it safe and grow a bunch of herbivores...  but then you aren't going to have the most exciting park in the world (sad face).  So maybe buy a roller coaster or two to try and attract guests to your park the good old fashioned way?\nWhen we first played Dinosaur Island we knew we had something extremely special on our hands.  We had an accessible worker placement game that mixed some of our favorite gameplay elements rolled up in a theme that is ridiculously fun and perfectly integrated with mechanics.  I love games that have simple mechanics that lead to incredibly tense decisions. Like a dice pool as a resource (DNA), set-collection, turn-efficiency, a clever auction mechanic, and extremely tense decisions about where to spend your time and energy?  Yes, please!  You can also focus on upgrading your laboratory to make dinosaur creation more efficient.  But if you do, it means you're spending less time on opening new rides.  And the constant pressure to keep your guests safe while still turning a profit every season creates interesting decision making on players. It\u2019s a nail biter, for sure.\n   Dinosaur Island is a unique worker placement game with a combination of fascinating mechanics that is unlike anything you have ever seen.\nSCALABLE GAME LENGTH: One of our favorite aspects of the game is the scalable length mechanism that can change the length of the game from sixty minutes to two and a half hours.  Regardless of player count!  If you're looking for a shorter game at the end of the night or the main course of a game-night, Dinosaur Island has you taken care of.  \nWe also have a unique mechanic we call the \"Plot-Twist\".  At the beginning of every game two Plot-Twist cards will be dealt out that will break the rules of the game in myriad ways.  These rule-changes will drastically alter your strategy and decision making throughout the game.  No memorizing the optimal strategy here.  Dinosaur Island will keep even the most experienced gamer on their toes each time.  In addition to the Plot Twists, the goal cards in each game will be unique, creating a totally different feel to each and every game of Dinosaur Island you play.  Familiar mechanics and new strategy welcome you each time you sit at the table.\n       The Deluxe edition comes with everything you see above plus shiny metal coins, special Spot UV on the box, metallic ink on the box, a special numbered edition, and it will never be reproduced for sale again.  This will be your only chance to get your hands on the delectable, chrome Deluxe edition of Dinosaur Island!  \nThere will also be some very special stretch goals as the campaign continues that we hope to add exclusively to the deluxe edition of the game.

In this case we were incredibly lucky to bring on Peter Wocken (graphic design Dead of Winter, Xia) and Kwanchai Moriya (illustrations Catacombs, Kodoma) and work with them to create this beautifully bonkers art look that evokes the feelings of late 80s/early 90s graphic design.\nYou know, back when dinosaurs were amazing scale covered multi-colored terror lizards.  Not dumb birds with feathers.  We wanted to go back to our own childhood and bring out the colors, patterns (oh, the patterns!) and feeling of sitting down and playing a game of Sim City to the look and feel of the game.\nWe leaned heavily on collectible card games, old board game design and specifically the artwork of Paper Girls (which is an amazing comic that you should all be reading).  We couldn't be happier with the way the game looks.  It\u2019s bright colors, really fun art and a sense of really living in the world that Peter and Kwanchai created.  It doesn't look like all the other board games out there, and we are really happy that it doesn't.\n                                                                                                      These are all the stretch goals we had planned for throughout the campaign.

By shipping within the EU, Australia, China, Canada and the United States we are hoping to get as favorable of shipping rates as possible.  We will be working with well-vetted partners in each region who have experience with Kickstarter reward fulfillment and come highly recommended by other publishers within the industry, and will take into account good (and bad) experiences that other publishers have experienced.\nOur goal is for the average shipping costs for backers in the EU (inclusive of the UK unless Theresa May really gets to it), US, Canada, Australia and China to be under 20 USD with shipping for backers outside of these regions to come from the most cost-effective area for the lowest possible shipping price.\nWe are charging 25 dollars for shipping during the campaign for international backers, and will refund any difference to you after the campaign ends.  Some backers in remote areas may have to pay additionally above this amount, but our goal is to not surprise people with shipping charges and wanted to be up front about potential costs.

Beautifully balanced, infinitely accessible and positively reviewed across the board, Keyflower sees players develop individual villages over the course of four seasons through the clever combination of auctions and worker placement. Keyples - your in-game workers - are used to bid on tiles to add them to your village, but can also activate these locations no matter who controls them.\nThe excellent Farmers and Merchants expansions added even more replayability, as did a selection of special promotional tiles. Now, on this pre-order campaign, we're delighted to announce the latest mini-expansion: Keymelequin!\nAll aboard!\nWhen this fine new vessel arrives in port, it transports two new characters, Paulo and Sven - special two-colored Keyples. Sven, who is a translator, co-ordinator and peacemaker between the blue and yellow Keyples, disembarks from the Keymelequin at the end of spring. Paulo, who has similar abilities with red and green keyples, arrives on the Keymelequin at the end of the summer. Paulo and Sven will facilitate team work and co-operation between their respective factions, with powerful and interesting results. For more information on the expansion, why not check out Richard's Keymelequin Geeklist over on BoardGameGeek?  \nKeymelequin is playable only with a copy of the game Keyflower, and it can be used with the base game on its own or in conjunction with any combination of the other Keyflower promotional tiles and expansions.\nThis campaign was created to help bring the latest printing of Keyflower to gamers in the US, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. Game Salute does not hold the rights to sell the game beyond these countries. The game is readily available in other territories through local partners - please contact your local game store for more details! \nIf you would like to add copies of the Keyflower: Merchants or Keyflower: Farmers expansions, we will have limited quantities available for backers to add during the pledge manager for those who have backed the campaign. Alternatively, you can pledge at the highest level of this campaign to receive the base game, both large expansions and the brand new Keymelequin pack.\nWhat about the Promo Tiles?\nWe know that our backers love promotional items, and Keyflower tiles are highly sought after. While we have some (but not all!) remaining from previous campaigns, we couldn't guarantee that there would be enough for everyone and have not put them in pledge levels on this page. Instead, when the campaign is complete, you'll be able to upgrade your pledge through Pledge Manager and add on any tiles that we have available on a first come, first served basis. We have Trader tiles, as well as Emporium and Monument tiles. Please note, we have no Beekeeper, Storyteller or Pig Shelter tiles.\nAnd Key to the City: London?\nWe'll also be making Key to the City: London available via the pledge manager when the campaign comes to an end. Please note that this will also be in limited amounts on a first come, first served basis! Here's the full rundown of what will be available post-campaign and how much each item will cost. Only pay for items that are in this campaign - the items below will be add-ons in the Pledge Manager when the campaign is over! \nThank you all for your support! If you're new to the Keyflower universe, we know you're in for one of the finest gaming experiences around. If you're already well versed in the game, we hope Keymelequin keeps you coming back for more! ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nGame Salute has delivered dozens and dozens of successful Kickstarter campaigns, and is a publisher of games recognized for their high quality components and production values.\n\nWhile printing, shipping, and processing delays are always a possibility, we have set a reasonable delivery date that allows time to handle difficulties. That said, there is always a possibility that a project may be delayed for some reason, and of course, vice versa, should the games arrive before the estimated delivery date, we will send them out as soon as we receive them.\n\nWe're so confident that you'll enjoy Keyflower and Keymelequin that we're backing it up with our Game Salute Guarantee. If you don't enjoy the game when you receive it, just send either back to our headquarters and we'll issue you a full refund, no questions asked.\n\nAlso, sometimes people may want to cancel their pledge after the campaign has ended, and that\u2019s fine too. We can handle this for you \u2013 all we need is for you to email Support@GameSalute.com with your Kickstarter username and full real name. Please note: when we receive your funds, we only receive around 90% of what you paid thanks to various fees and charges, so we offer a 90% refund if you want to cancel your pledge.\n\nThanks for supporting Keyflower and Keymelequin!

The Dragon Tray comes in many different designs and features everything from a single large well to multiple well holding areas. The multiple well designs are intended for board games that have tokens, coins, or other items that need to be kept in place during play.\nRubber Feet.

The feet protect your table and guard against spilled liquids.\nWall Hanging. All Dragon Trays come with wall hanging hardware installed, allowing you to display and store your epic piece of gaming hardware in your home. \nFinishes. Finishing is an art. We have spent countless hours refining and perfecting our finishing process to bring you some of the most stunning pieces of art available. Many woodworkers avoid custom finishes as it is very time and labor intensive. High quality finishing is a source of pride at Dog Might. One third of our shop is dedicated to the finishing process. \nOur in house professional artist has over 20 years of experience, and mixes all of his own custom tints and varnishes. Every product has a triple coat of varnish, guaranteeing a lifetime of durability and performance. In creating products that are intended for everyday use at your gaming table, we feel that hand rubbed oil finishes are not of high enough quality and durability for our products. Our custom varnishes and tints do not require reapplication, are highly water resistant, and help protect from UV rays and humidity.\nStability. All Dragon Trays are created from hand selected wood that is banded for strength and stability. Banding the wood prevents warping and other movement that would degrade the product.\n\"I LOVE this tray. It's solid, and the quality is just what I'd expect from Dog Might.\" - Raine from Initative:Tabletop\n  \"The level of craftsmanship is clearly on display here with Dog Might Games Dragon Trays.

It takes only 20 minutes to play, but when you finish, you'll want to play it again. That's because Wordsy is unlike most other word games.\nIn Wordsy, you get 8 letters dealt out on the table. All players simultaneously try to come up with the best word on the board.\nHere's the thing: you don't need all the letters in your word to be on the board. You can add as many letters as you want! So you're never just one letter away, like in most word games. \nThis means Wordsy rewards longer words. Those 2- and 3-letter words you have to memorize for other word games won't help you here!\nHere's a sample board. What word do you see? Remember that you can use any word you want, other than words with capital letters, hyphens, or apostrophes. You can skip both vowels and consonants; you're just trying to use as many letters on the board as you can.\nTo figure out your word's score, add together the value of the column each letter is in. You only score each letter once, even if the letter is in your word more than once. The Z is worth 2 bonus points, and the K is worth 1 bonus point.\n...\nI'll give you a few seconds...\n...\n...a few more seconds...\n...\nDid you see the word CATS, for 14 points?\nHow about SCRATCHING, for 21 points?\nKudos if you found BACKSCATTERING, for 27 points!\n  Play is simultaneous. All players try to come up with the single best word on the board at the same time. There's a 30-second sand timer within easy reach, but it's not running yet.\nThe first player to write down their word takes the 30-second sand timer and flips it on their scoresheet. They're now the fastest player, and they cannot change their word.\nAll other players have 30 seconds to write down their words. After 30 seconds, it's pencils down and time to score.\nIn addition to scoring your word's bonus, you get bonus points if your word scores more points than the fastest player's word, or if you're the fastest player and your word is better than half the other players' words.\nAfter 7 rounds, each player adds the scores of their best 5 words plus all their bonus points. The player with the most points wins!\nWant to learn more about the game? Read the rulebook draft, or try it yourself with a free, no-art print-and-play version of the game!\nAnd if you're on Twitter, check out @WordsyBot, which tweets out a different board of letters every 30 minutes!\nWordsy is a re-implementation of my first published game Prolix, which Z-Man Games released in 2010. While I'm proud of Prolix and its accomplishments (like making the Games 100), I've learned a lot about game design in the past six years, and I've always wanted to return to my first game to see what lessons I could apply to it.\nWordsy takes half the time to play that Prolix does. Its rules are much easier to learn and follow. It is smoother to play. And it scales to 6 players better than its predecessor.\nI'm really happy with how Wordsy came out. It's become a very important game to me. I feel like it's doing the things that I really wanted to do with Prolix.\nSo many games have optimistic player counts, but when you actually play them, it turns out that the 2-player game was just marketing, or the 6-player game is intolerably long.\nWordsy scales smoothly and effortlessly from 1-6 players. Really. I've played dozens of games at each player count, and I put a lot of work into making sure the 1-player game is just as good as the 6-player game.\nNo. Wordsy is a real-time game, but it's not a twitch game. You're eligible to get bonus points if you're the fastest player and your word is good, but if you come up with a lousy word just to run the timer, everyone will score bonus points off you. 30 seconds is long enough to think of something!\nBut don't take my word for it...\n               \"Wordsy is truly a unique word building game that fosters creativity and clever thought over simple mastery of the English language. With its focus clearly on allowing its players to create words of their choosing over making them use all the letters revealed from round to round, Wordsy become incredibly approachable and enjoyable for a variety of gamers.\" - Man Vs. Meeple\n\"After several plays through the game, this is going to be one I get to the table as often as possible. It\u2019s quick, anyone can play, and the myriad letter recombinations means near-infinite replayability.\" - GeekDad\n\"So here's the final word: if you enjoy speedy games that tax your nerves as well as your creative thinking skills, Wordsy is certainly one game to check out.\" - Cardboard Republic\n\"Wordsy gives me the freedom to dream big. The outlay provided by the cards is only a starting point. It\u2019s an invitation to search my memory banks for words that fit the pattern of the letters on the board. It is definitely a step up in fun and challenge from Boggle and Scrabble and other games that limit your choices, and the addition of the timed bonuses really adds some punch to the experience.\" - Board Game Gumbo\n\"Wordsy is so smart in so many ways. The puzzle it presents is simple \u2013 open your word-hoard and release the most potent salvo you can. And yet, because of the timing element, each round has this really awesome arc of tension; you start slow and before you know it, someone decides that \u2018quell\u2019 is good enough and you\u2019ve got 30 incredibly short seconds to decide between \u2018loquacious\u2019 and \u2018qualifications\u2019 and damn it, why did they have to start with such a short, obvious word?!?\" - Gameosity\n\"Wordsy is a game that takes the standard word game mechanics and flips them into something completely new and interesting. Not only does it shake things up, but it makes you have to think in different and unique ways, which is a blast!\" - Meeple Mountain\nCheck out some more great reviews!\n  Thanks for following along the campaign!

The more people back the game, the lower each copy will cost to print, and the nicer I can make the final product! I'm very excited about some of these stretch goals.\nOne important note: if I ever reprint this game, there's no guarantee the reprint will have these stretch goals. Backing this Kickstarter will be your most likely way to get a premium edition of Wordsy!\nFUNDED! Thank you, backers!\nFUNDED! Each game will ship with 100 double-sided scoresheets, up from 50 double-sided scoresheets. \nI like having my games come with everything they need in the box. And at $16,000, we can do that. If we reach this level, you will get six cute golf pencils in each box.\nThe base game comes in a traditional 2-piece box. But if we reach $18,000, I will ship the game in a lovely magnetic clasp box that opens like a book!\nAt this level, we will put gorgeous foil stamping on the cover!\n  If you're a customer within the EU your rewards will ship from within the EU. Keep in mind that some countries like Switzerland are physically within Europe but are not EU members. If you're in a non-EU-member nation, you may still have to pay customs, taxes, or import fees on your package.\nIf you are outside North America, your shipment will not be tracked unless you specifically request it. In a perfect world, I'd ship with tracking, but it's shockingly expensive!\nIf you're from outside North America and you'd like tracking on your shipment, message me and we can work something out.\nI may offer early backer pickup at conventions like UKGE or Origins (no promises, it depends on the schedule). In these cases, I will not be able to refund shipping for backers who choose to pick up at conventions.

I wanted to take advantage of the new tools offered to designers, and release my work directly to the public.\nSo far, it seems to be working. I've almost sold out the initial print runs of my first two games,\nI believe that part of the reason for my success is that Formal Ferret Games allows me to demonstrate my passion for my games directly. People can see how much sweat and labor I put into what I do, and how great I try to make them before they hit shelves.\nIndie game design and publishing is a lot of work, but it's incredible work.

Anyone who's used Kickstarter to back a tabletop game can tell you about projects that funded but delivered late... if at all.\n\nI've been designing games for a long time, and I now have two successful Kickstarter projects under my belt: The Networks and Bad Medicine. And by \"successful,\" I don't just mean that they funded. Both projects shipped to backers all around the world within a month of the estimated ship date.\n\nI've backed enough projects to know what tends to go wrong with a tabletop campaign. Here is what I'm doing to make sure Wordsy will not be delayed.\n\nFirst: Game design and graphic design are done. This game is ready to be sent to the printer. In fact, I am already in pre-production with the printer, so once the game funds, we will be ready to proof a physical copy of the game.\n\nSecond: I got a lot of feedback about production quality in my last Kickstarter project, so I've made a change. Wordsy will be printed by Panda Games, one of the biggest and best-known hobby game printers in the world. \n\nThird: I will be using Funagain Games to deliver Wordsy to the US and most of the world, instead of trying to handle things myself. That leaves shipping in the hands of people who can send packages safely and quickly, and who understand that tabletop games require more packaging than other products. I'm also using a separate fulfillment service based in the EU to handle EU fulfillment, which will relieve a lot of logistical and tax-related headaches.\n\nFourth: I am using a company called OTX to handle the logistics of transporting the manufactured games from the plant in China to the warehouse in the US. This is an intricate process, but OTX is quite used to it, and they specialize in board game logistics.\n\nFifth: I've backed plenty of Kickstarter projects, some which delivered on time, some which delivered late, and some that never delivered at all. I learned a lot from each of them.\n\nAt this point, I'm familiar with just about everything that can go wrong in a Kickstarter. Believe me, failing to fund is not even close to the worst-case scenario! I've heard many stories, from artists never delivering their art, to pallets stolen at the port, to mold in the game boxes and snails in the shipping container.\n\nBut I've built a great team around me. I feel that I am prepared to deliver this product to you close to my estimate of July 2017.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "WATCH WORD", "descp": "Thanks for following along the campaign!

The first player to complete the puzzle by positioning their heroes accordingly collect the quest card and its benefits. \n  Each round is broken down into two phases, the day phase and the night phase.\n  In the night phase, players will roll adventure dice in a communal press-your-luck fashion to try to accomplish the tasks at the locations they ended at during the day phase. This could be fighting a goblin, learning a spell, or delving into a temple. But be careful, if you take too much damage you may exhaust and lose all that round's progress and more! \nPlayers keep track of their heroes' collective health, power and progress on personal adventure logs.\nAnd when you acquire powerful items, you equip them right to your ITEMeeples\u2122! \nPlayers keep track of their spell progress, and the rounds magic level on a community magic mat. As the round's magic increases, goblins become more threatening and even your own power turns from good to bad!\nAfter five rounds, the game is over. While you may not have single handedly saved the world, did you accomplish more than the other players?

It can be prone to many mistakes and delays, even for experienced publishers.\n\nWe're proud to say that we are prepared for the task at hand and have years of experience in successfully producing board games and fulfilling Kickstarter projects.\n\nHere are the steps we take to prepare and reduce the likelihood of mistakes and delays:\n\n1. We have done significant pre-production. This includes having all the illustrations for the game complete and the graphic art over 75% complete. The production quote is in hand and ready to be initiated.\n\n2. We are working with our long time partners Panda Game Manufacturing. Who we've worked with on over 10 separate projects and have a great relationship with. We are familiar with their production requirements, timelines, payment schedules, communication methods and Chinese freight arrangements and costs for when it comes time for shipping. We will provide tracking information for the boat when the games leave China.\n\n3. We are working with Ship Naked again for project fulfillment. Having worked with them for over 4 years, we are confident that they can handle any amount of work we send their way. They have fulfilled all our projects and have proven to be communicative, punctual and respectful when dealing with our customers.\n\nAbove all, I am 100% dedicated to backer communication. I will be transparent with our process and involve our backers as much as possible. I will be present daily during the project to answer any questions and I read every comment.

These editions taught us a great deal about how to effectively customize our stories in more complex and interesting ways. We have integrated the ability to include more robust types of customization into our redesigned production system, thus allowing us to offer more points at which Filigree in Shadow can be modified for each recipient, including our stretch goal of offering a choice of epilogues. We are very excited about this change, as it improves the verisimilitude and depth of immersion into the experience and allows you to be directly involved in the creation of a memory that will last a lifetime.\n  Should you require a little more information about us, you may find the following videos helpful.

To date, we have successfully completed four pre-order driven experiences and one Kickstarter-backed experience, delivered thousands of Mysterious Packages worldwide, and have become very adept at this process. We already have the technology, skills, and staff required to manufacture and fulfill scores of orders.\n\nIn our Kickstarter for The Century Beast, we said, \u201cthere is always the possibility that this can take longer than we anticipate, as we are very detail-oriented, and will opt for getting every detail right over being fast every time.\u201d While it behooves us to include this caveat again, the likelihood of its coming into play is significantly lower this time around. We have learned a great deal from The Century Beast and have taken those lessons to heart. We have substantially improved our ability to produce and deliver our unique tales by adding to our talented and innovative staff and significantly redesigning our production and fulfillment processes.\n\nWe are confident that we can meet our deadlines, with the first chapter shipping April 2017, and completion of the experience in approximately two months.

Risk and Challenges, it would seem, are not concepts you consider intimidating. It is only fair, therefore, that we attempt to match your perseverance, and admit our own shortcomings and limitations. After all, should you choose to cast aside your own safety for the sake of The Orphans, the least we can do is tell you how we, personally, may well screw this up for you and for them.\n\nBeing skillful and unapologetic pessimists, we have assumed few to none would be foolish enough to back this doomed venture. As such, a base funding goal of $4,097 was set, a minuscule pittance for some, but a seemingly insurmountable goal for The Orphans. \n\nShipping, of course, would be entrusted to the good people at USPS, UPS, or, depending on the final funding amount, a fulfillment company.\n\nEndangered Orphans will use EU friendly shipping. Alternatively, the value of the game will be listed at a reduced sales cost, matching the reward level you may have chosen, allowing the minimum threshold for Import duty and VAT to be charged in many countries. Of course, we can't assure an unpleasant plague, insidious virus, or fluid-sapping arachnids won't also hitch a ride with the packages, as they all want to do. But, again, you aren't one to concern yourself with petty risks.\n\nEndangered Orphans of Condyle Cove has been painstakenly, even painfully, playtested by groups ranging in age from far too old to care to far too young to understand. Though not all were completely enthralled by the activities, not one person broke out in any form or rash, expired from mysterious causes, or found fit to physically assault or belittle us, and thus we feel comfortable saying that, at the very least, that it plays as promised and is unlikely to cause you death, though far be it from us to jinx anything. \n\nFurthermore, all of the artwork, accessories, and pre-press deliverables have been completed and the final game is ready to be manufactured at the very moment the campaign concludes, a rare show of optimism on our part. In keeping with that uncharacteristic idealism, we feel that the full, fast, incident free delivery of all pre-stretch goal deliverables is within reach. \n\nIn the event of a legitimate miracle that allows us to reach any of our preposterous stretch goals, we will unquestionably provide constant and detailed updates on not only our steps to assure full and pleasant delivery of the promised rewards, but also of our utter and complete shock and humble outpouring of gratitude and indebtedness. Also, perhaps, our in-depth investigation into who may be behind such a cruel hoax. \n\nIn summation, we feel that there is nothing we have promised that we can not deliver, if in fact we find that others, like you, so choose to put your own happiness on hold for the sake of imaginary, illustrated Orphans. \n \nBless you all, and good luck.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "THE \u201cLEAST WE CAN DO\u201d LEVEL", "descp": "For those asking \u201cwhat\u2019s the LEAST I can do to help The Orphans?\u201d, here is your answer.

It is also available for immediate purchase and delivery HERE, if you'd rather not wait. If you're a retailer and would like to carry Tiny Epic Galaxies please inquire HERE.\n                    Deluxe content features the Drones mini-expansion, which integrates with the pilots, and four additional pilot cards. Additional pilots to include TWO very special cameo appearances by Andy Weir and Tim Schafer!! See them compete in Tiny Epic Galaxies on TableTop Season 4 (coming soon)!\n  ***Kickstarter-Limited Exclusivity - Deluxe content will not enter regular distribution. However, it will be available in limited supply at conventions, through contests, online at the BGG promo store, and directly from Gamelyn Games on our website or through our Amazon store.\nIf you are wanting to learn more about Tiny Epic Galaxies, please visit the original Kickstarter page HERE. \nTEG Beyond the Black expands Tiny Epic Galaxies in a few ways:\n1. Pilots (Variable Powers)! Now players compete to hire the best pilots, with powerful abilities, in addition to competing over the best planets.\nPilots are hired by activating 2, or 3, like dice. You activate 2 like dice if the pilot you're hiring is trained to fly the ship you're assigning them to, or you activate 3 like dice if you need to assign the pilot to a ship they are not trained to fly.\n2. Exploration (Press-Your-Luck)! Now you can send your ships into unexplored space on a hunt for resources or exploration badges! But beware, you may end up in the orbit of a black hole or being forced to lose resources of your own. To explore, you simply move a ship onto the exploration card. Then, if there are any exploration cards face up, you may take one. OR, you can flip over the top card of the deck, if it's red, you must take it and stop exploring. If it's green, you can take it, or go again until 3 exploration cards are face up, at which point you would have to take the next card you flip.\n3. Badges (Set-Collection)! Thought you had a handle on everyone's scores in Tiny Epic Galaxies?? Now you'll have to think again. Players will be collecting exploration badges from pilots they hire and exploration cards they acquire. After the game is over, players are rewarded bonus victory points for each badge type they have the most of. These points can stack up fast and provide opportunities for come-from-behind victories! \n  Since Tiny Epic Galaxies Beyond the Black is an expansion to Tiny Epic Galaxies, we will grandfather the component qualities from TEG into TEGBTB.\nFREE COMPONENT UPGRADES\n2mm Box Thickness\nSpot UV Box Logos\nBox Interior Printing (using the hangar image at the top of the page)\n310 gsm Ivory Core Linen Cardstock\nCards with Rounded Corners\nBelow are additional upgrades the game will come with if we are able to reach the listed goals.

To offset this, while remaining fiscally responsible, we have included a small discount for ALL shipping, but no shipping is free.\nRegarding customs: because this game comes in a tiny box with a low declaration, most international backers, of 1 and 2 copies, will not get hit with customs or import fees. The games will be delivered right to your door. We have shipped thousands and thousands of copies of Tiny Epic games to international backers without any occurrences.\n  Add-ons, such as base and deluxe copies of TEGBTB, Premium Print & Plays (including the TEGBTB premium PnP), previous Tiny Epic games, play mats, and more, will be offered in PledgeManager. Though the full menu won't be offered until the PledgeManager is open.\nAll reward tiers offer access to PledgeManager. \nYou MAY add to your pledge for add-ons shown on the above PledgeManager menu and your additional funds will be available for you in PledgeManager. \nPlease do not add to your pledge for items not shown on the above PledgeManager menu. \n      The 6 design goals of a Tiny Epic game!\n\"Tiny Epic\" is an exclusive series of small box games produced by Gamelyn Games and designed by Scott Almes.  \nEach game in the series is entirely unique but strictly adheres to TWO core values: TINY and EPIC!  \n\u2022 TINY referring to the small box used for each game AND the simple, easy to understand, set of rules each possess.  \n\u2022 EPIC referring to their surprisingly gratifying gameplay.

It can be prone to many mistakes and that does not exclude experienced publishers.\n\nWe're proud to say that we are prepared for the task at hand and have years of experience in successfully fulfilling Kickstarter projects.\n\nHere are the steps we take to prepare and reduce the likelihood of mistakes and delays:\n\n1. We have done significant pre-production. This includes having all the illustrations for the game complete and the graphic art over 75% complete. The production quote is in hand and ready to be initiated.\n\n2. We are working with our long time partners Panda Game Manufacturing. Who we've worked with on over 10 separate projects and have a great relationship with. We are familiar with their production requirements, timelines, payment schedules, communication methods and Chinese freight arrangements and costs for when it comes time for shipping. We will provide tracking information for the boat when the games leave China. \n\n3. We are working with Ship Naked again for project fulfillment. Having worked with them for over 4 years, we are confident that they can handle any amount of work we send their way. They have fulfilled all our projects and have proven to be communicative, punctual and respectful when dealing with our customers.\n\nAbove all, I am 100% dedicated to backer communication.

Some players enjoy the freedom to use any letter on the board, allowing their inner word ninja to come out and spell ridiculously long words. Others prefer a more strategic route, carefully selecting which letters to use to control the board and mess with their opponents.\nWill you expand your holdings by spelling long words? Will you strategically block your opponents or steal priceless artifacts, permanently claiming the associated letter for your exclusive use? Will you use the super-mega-evil arsenal letters with their devious powers?\nThe winner of Word Domination is often not the player with the largest vocabulary, but the player who can most strategically use their vocabulary to come out on top.\nTake the role of a 1970s-era criminal mastermind, each with their own, unique character ability\nEvery letter represents a priceless artifact or landmark that you can steal - over 100 different artifacts included, each with its own unique art\nHard-to-use letters are the super-mega-evil arsenal - things like the Vaporshock Rocket, X-Ray Goggles, or the Zeppelin Lift - each with their own devious power\nFeel like a genius - even non-word gamers can spell massive words, thanks to the open playing area\nCompletely interactive - unlike many word games, you'll be messing with your opponents on every turn\nStrategic gameplay - deciding which letters to use can make the all difference\nCo-op gameplay variant included - team up with your friends and pull off the heist of the century\nSolo variant also included - who needs friends? Conquer the world on all your own\nEasy to learn, easy to teach - read the rules or watch an overview\n  Ships from within the international region to avoid VAT and other import taxes.\n    In Word Domination, players spell words using any available letter on the board, canvassing the priceless artifacts they contain. On subsequent turns, players attempt to steal those letters, claiming them for the player\u2019s exclusive use. A cunning player will carefully select which letters to steal, as adjacent letters can be more valuable at the end.\nFor a quick run-down of how to play, check out the video below:\nFor a complete description of game play, see the player manual here.\n  To ensure Word Domination is as attractive as it is fun, we've brought in two of the most talented illustrators in the industry.\nThe character illustrations are being created by Ryan Goldsberry, the same illustrator whose art is featured on Paperback and Burgle Bros. His clever and unique take on the 1970s-era \"bond villain\" perfectly captures the theme of Word Domination.\nFor the letter tiles, we wanted a \"blueprint\" theme - something that would represent the villains scheming over priceless artifacts. We worked with Andrew Colin Beck, whose icons and illustrations have been featured in some of the biggest magazines and websites in the world.\nThere are over 100 tiles in the game. Each tile contains a unique priceless artifact or arsenal to steal, all with completely unique artwork.\n  Here are a couple bonus items you can add to your pledge. Here's how to add these items to your pledge: Click \"Back this Project\" and then select your pledge tier. Add the amount for the desired Add-On to your pledge total. After the campaign, we'll send a survey asking which items you ordered. All items ship in May with Word Domination - the savings are because they will all ship together.\nGive your play area the comfort it deserves. This oversized playmat is the perfect size to play any configuration of Word Domination. It includes preset grids for a 2, 3, or 4-player game, with enough extra tile spots to allow the game to naturally grow. There is a built-in round counter, spot for unused tiles, and a reminder of basic turn mechanics and arsenal tile powers. This mat will not only look great but also help streamline your playing experience. Artwork still in final developed and subject to improve over time.\n  Interested in playing Word Domination in a non-English language? Thanks to the clever ideas of our backers, we've devised a solution: blank tiles. Each set comes with 10 tiles to which you can add the letters you need to play in your language. To make the tiles more accessible to international backers, we are providing flat rate shipping for these tiles. Add up to 5 sets of 10 to your order for $5 each and only pay your associated shipping fee once.\n  Paperback is an innovative mix of word game and deckbuider - but you are writing Romance Novels. You can win by being great at words or great at deckbuilding. It's the perfect companion game to Word Domination. Includes all stretch goals. Check out more about Paperback\n  By popular demand, it's the \"Genius by birth, Evil by choice\" backer pin. Let the world know your stance on morality. Note: there is a limited quantity of these pins, and once they're gone, they're gone.\n  Without your help, we won't be able to print this game and share it with the world.\nHelp guide the development of this game. We listen to our backers and strive to implement their clever ideas.\nOnce funded, our stretch goals will add more content and better components to improve the game for everyone.\nBackers receive the game at a discount compared to after the campaign.\nThis game is not going to distributors. It may not be in your local store.\nWe don't fill up your shelf. It's a big game that we've squeezed into a small box.\nEuropean copies will be sent from inside the EU to avoid VAT.\nNon-English backers can purchase blank tiles, allowing them to customize the game for their language.\n  Jeff Beck is a game designer and host of the gaming podcast, Your Tables On Fire!

This game delivers all that and more in a nifty little package.\"\n- MHGreenleaf\n\"Amazing little worker placement game. I've play-tested this multiple times and am anxiously awaiting the Kickstarter\"\n- nlwelch\nYou can download the rules here\nDuring the game each player will have a limited number of Mint Tokens, which represent their workers.\nPlayers will use these mint tokens to earn more tokens, take first player or buy and build plans.\nPlans are how players earn points. Some plans will only give points, others will give extra powers to the owner.\nOnce a player has at least 7 points, play continues until the end of the the round, at which point the game ends.\nWhoever has the most points provided by plans they have built wins! \nFive24 Labs on Social Media:\nFacebook\nTwitter\nNewsletter\nMint Works was created in response to the 2015 Mint Tin Design Contest created by R4D6 on BGG. The list of constraints for the competition were as follows:\nThe game must fit within a mint tin.\nThat was it! Such a simple constraint, but it gave me the push I needed to come up with a fun idea.\nBecause a mint tin is so easily portable, and designed to be rugged enough to fit in a pocket, I considered making a game that would be good on the go. (Initial versions of the game actually used the mints that came in a tin as the tokens. This stopped shortly after my children ate them.)\nI thought, what would be a good game to carry around in your pocket that isn't typical for that form factor. Worker Placement would be neat, I thought and so I ran with it. The rules turned out to be fairly simple and so I realized I had a super portable gateway worker placement game.\nMint Works will be something you can carry with you on a day to day basis and use it to introduce new people into our amazing hobby of strategic gaming.\nThat wasn't enough though, the game shouldn't be boring after a few plays. I wanted something that would be re-playable. Something that, once you got the initial concepts down, you could start to really dig in with other players.\nReports from testers over the months have come in saying that they enjoy playing, and will sit down 1 v 1 and play several games in a row and discuss theories about optimum turn sequences, what plans are best picked up at which parts of the game or when the lotto might show up.\nThis blew my mind! I had managed to do it, make an easy to learn fun to continue to play type of game.\nThe wall of contributors is my way of giving people some recognition regardless of the amount of contribution they have provided. It's small currently, but as I continue to do more and more campaigns I hope it can grow large enough that I'll have to re-consider how it works.\nIf you are excited enough for Mint Works that you just can't wait for the fully produced copies to get here from the factory, I have provided a limited pledge level.\nThis level will entitle you to a copy of the fully factory produced version of Mint Works as all other backers, but it will also include a hand made advanced copy delivered shortly after the campaign ends.\nThe advanced copies will be entirely hand made by me in my workshop and numbered. (e.g. 03/50.)\nThe advance copies will be of similar quality to the prototypes that you  see in the review videos. See below for examples.\nBecause Mint Works is a small game in terms of physical size and weight, shipping costs are very reasonable. The manufacturing costs are low enough that VAT shouldn't be a concern.\nI wish that I could provide free shipping to the majority of places, however the low price point of the game means I have very little wiggle room for costs. That said, I will be providing free shipping within the US, and applying a discount to shipping elsewhere equal to the cost of shipping within the US.\nHere is a brief chart explaining the shipping costs:\n* The vast majority of countries falls in this region, including: Argentina (AR), Australia (AU), Austria (AT), Bahrain (BH), Belarus (BY), Belgium (BE), Belize (BZ), Bulgaria (BG), Brunei Darussalam (BN), Canada (CA), Cayman Islands (KY), Chile (CL), China (CN), Colombia (CO), Costa Rica (CR), Croatia (HR), Cyprus (CY), Czech Republic (CZ), Denmark (DK), Estonia (EE), Finland (FI), France (FR), Germany (DE), Greece (GR), Hong Kong (HK), Hungary (HU), Iceland (IS), India (IN), Indonesia (ID), Ireland (IE), Israel (IL), Italy (IT), Japan (JP), Korea, Republic of (KR), Latvia (LV), Lithuania (LT), Luxembourg (LU), Malaysia (MY), Malta (MT), Montenegro (ME), Netherlands (NL), New Zealand (NZ), Norway (NO), Peru (PE), Philippines (PH), Poland (PL), Portugal (PT), Qatar (QA), Romania (RO), Saudi Arabia (SA), Serbia (RS), Singapore (SG), Slovakia (SK), Slovenia (SI), South Africa (ZA), Spain (ES), Sweden (SE), Switzerland (CH), Taiwan (TW), Thailand (TH), Turkey (TR), Ukraine (UA), United Arab Emirates (AE), United Kingdom (GB)\n** Brazil, Mexico, Russia and any countries not previously listed fall into this category.\nI would like to support retailers who are interested in getting Mint Works before the game makes its way into distribution.\nIf you're a retailer, please send me a message here on Kickstarter, or email retail@five24labs.com during the campaign for pricing information. \nCurrently we are a small but potent team that consists of myself, my buddy Mel and my awesome testing group. I'd like to use this space to acknowledge and thank them.\nI have an amazing, excellent and dedicated group of players that tolerate my crazy ideas and endless iterations. They are up to the task of attempting to break things, and giving real feedback as we develop projects.\n I can't possibly thank them enough for all the work they do for the wages of snacks and fun!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis campaign is only my second campaign, and my first (Area 1851) didn't fund initially. This was the result of some poor choices I had made during setting up and ramping up into the campaign, that in turn resulted in its funding failure.\n\nFortunately enough, Game Salute was able to bring it back a while later and that project successfully funded and is in stores now. This has provided me with a little more insight into what goes on beyond the campaign.\n\nThis means that a lot of what will be going on post funding will be new to me. So I'll be doing a bit of learning on the job as this project progresses. That said, I'm always open to hearing advice and willing to take reasonable suggestions into consideration.\n\nSince my previous campaign, I've also backed a lot more projects, and I've seen a lot of good examples of what to do, and what not to do. I'm going to be taking all of those lessons to heart.\n\nAnother thing going for me with Mint Works is the size of the project. This will greatly reduce the risk of the entire endeavor.\n\nThe biggest risk I foresee at the moment is coordinating the production of the mint tins and the game. This is because the manufacturers I've talked with either can't get tins in the right size, or the cost of the ones they offer in the right size is far too high.\n\nThis means I have to have the tins produced in a second factory, then sent to the game manufacturer, where they will affix labels to the tins and pack them with the game components.\n\nHaving the tins meet the game components and getting all of that packaged up in a timely manner will be the toughest part I suspect.\n\nHowever, I'm committed to full transparency of the project and will do my best to ensure things go according to plan.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Contributor", "descp": "Option to have your name (or pseudonym) posted with a message up to 140 characters in length on our \"Wall of Contributors.\"", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2016"}], "stat": ["33 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "Standard Supporter", "descp": "One (1) copy of Mint Works with standard components, plus all stretch goals, and the \"Contributor\" reward.\nINCLUDES:\nMint Works", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["5,346 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 19 or more", "title": "Double Down", "descp": "Two (2) copies of Mint Works with standard components, plus all stretch goals, and the \"Contributor\" reward.\nINCLUDES:\n2\u00d7 Mint Works", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["723 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 28 or more", "title": "The Triple", "descp": "Three (3) copies of Mint Works with standard components, plus all stretch goals, and the \"Contributor\" reward.\nINCLUDES:\n3\u00d7 Mint Works", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["128 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 45 or more", "title": "Gift Giver", "descp": "Five (5) copies of Mint Works with standard components, plus all stretch goals, and the \"Contributor\" reward.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["56 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 90 or more", "title": "Glorious Gamer", "descp": "Ten (10) copies of Mint Works with standard components, plus all stretch goals, and the \"Contributor\" reward.\nINCLUDES:\n10\u00d7 Mint Works", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["11 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "Standard Supporter", "descp": "One (1) copy of Mint Works with standard components, plus all stretch goals, and the \"Contributor\" reward.\nINCLUDES:\nMint Works", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["Reward no longer available", "247 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 19 or more", "title": "Double Down", "descp": "Two (2) copies of Mint Works with standard components, plus all stretch goals, and the \"Contributor\" reward.\nINCLUDES:\n2\u00d7 Mint Works", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["Reward no longer available", "26 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 45 or more", "title": "Eager Enthusiast", "descp": "One (1) limited edition hand made and numbered advance copy of Mint Works to be delivered by October 31st 2016.\nOne (1) copy of Mint Works with standard components, plus all stretch goals, and the \"Contributor\" reward.\nINCLUDES:\nMint Works\nHand-Made Numbered Mint Works Advanced Copy", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["Reward no longer available", "50 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 45 or more", "title": "Gift Giver", "descp": "Five (5) copies of Mint Works with standard components, plus all stretch goals, and the \"Contributor\" reward.\nINCLUDES:\n5\u00d7 Mint Works", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["Reward no longer available", "25 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 90 or more", "title": "Glorious Gamer", "descp": "Ten (10) copies of Mint Works with standard components, plus all stretch goals, and the \"Contributor\" reward.\nINCLUDES:\n10\u00d7 Mint Works", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["Reward no longer available", "4 backers"]}], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #35", "update_userinfo": "Mint Delivery - Coming to Kickstarter August 29th", "update_content": "Hey there!

Distributor/Manufacturer may collaboratively ship some rewards from other countries to save on shipping and customs costs.\nDelivering Your Reward Responsibly\nOur number one goal and responsibility is to deliver the rewards that our backers pledge for as soon as possible. Magic Meeple Games and its partners have years of collective experience overseeing planning and production to ensure Fire of Eidolon well be delivered to all backers in a timely manner. We ran into a speed bump with Darkrock Ventures but it is manufactured is likely to be in backers' hands before the conclusion of the Fire of Eidolon campaign. We have also taken measures to prevent the same delays from happening again. The bottom line is that Darkrock Ventures was produced and paid for on time, and while it has taken longer than we anticipated to deliver, it will deliver, and is doing so as we speak, and that is something we can all be proud of. \nEvery backer is important to us, regardless of location, just as much every pledge makes a difference, regardless of amount. Unfortunately shipping costs are something we all have to face, we have learned more about shipping and distribution and our service providers have become more creative in ways to save money. We are proud to offer FLAT RATE, CUSTOMS-FRIENDLY shipping available WORLDWIDE!\nOh, and that part about \"Flat Rate\"? We mean it, this time... it's really flat.\nOrder any amount of copies of FoE and only pay shipping on ONE!\nAdding additional copies of Fire of Eidolon will not incur additional shipping charges in this campaign. We are going to discount every pledge down to charging shipping on only the first copy of Fire of Eidolon in each order!*\n*Shipping price is for delivery of one entire order to a single address.\n*Residents of Brazil, Russia, and South America take note: to ensure your package is delivered, additional charges may be required to ensure delivery verification in certain regions of these countries. If these additional charges are not paid, the chances of lost packages in those regions increases sharply and our distributor is attempting to implement solutions to this problem. If you reside in any of these countries please inquire about your pledge before the end of the campaign as the $10 basic shipping charge cannot guarantee delivery in these countries.\nRegarding Customs: Our shipping partner, Ship Naked, offers what they call \"Customs-Friendly Worldwide Shipping\" meaning they coordinate all transport, customs clearance, and brokerage from the factory to the destination using shipping depots all around the world. They have already laid the groundwork to ensure all packages will make it to backers in every country as smoothly and inexpensively as possible. While we cannot personally guarantee that no single person will have any customs difficulties on an individual level, we are confident in Ship Naked's ability to mitigate any potential issues and keep surprise costs far away from our backers and their ability to make it right should any such problems arise. We have had very few individual cases of customs difficulties and the processes have improved even more since those challenges have occurred. Pledge with Confidence!\nAfter the Kickstarter campain ends, we will use PledgeManager to manage your orders and give everyone one last opportunity to add on to their pledge. There are no separate Add-Ons during the Kickstarter campaign, only the pledge levels. \nIf you'd like to add additional copies of the game to your pledge beyond what is available in the reward tiers, or if you would like access to the special FoE Backer price on our previous project, Darkrock Ventures, you will be able to do so within PledgeManager after this Kickstarter campaign ends. (PledgeManager will charge backers separately for any additional add-ons beyond what was pledged for in the Kickstarter.)\n  Forget to order that extra copy for your friend?

It is prone to many surprises and problems even for experienced publishers. Fortunately our team is comprised of exceptionally experienced and talented individuals, with years of expertise in Game Design, Game Development, Print Publishing, Product Manufacturing, Project Fulfillment, Art, Technical Documentation, Retailer Support, Retail & Online Sales, Technology Support, and Graphics Design. \n\nWe co-published our first project, Darkrock Ventures, with the collaboration of the exceptionally experienced Gamelyn Games, and that project was a SUCCESS. We at Magic Meeple Games are proud to say that we are prepared for the task at hand and have even more experience and knowledge in our corner with successful fulfillment of board game projects.\n\nOur first project fell a few months short of our target Shipping date, we have identified several contributing factors to that delay and have actively made improvements in our process to prevent the likelihood of such delays happening again. Here are the steps we are taking to prepare and reduce the likelihood of mistakes and delays:\n\n1. We have done even more extensive pre-production for Fire of Eidolon than our last project. More of the Art and Graphic design was handled in-house for this project and we eliminated opportunities for this aspect of the project to cause delays. Portions of the project which we will be handling with the help of contractors is in process already and in many ways, already complete. We are better prepared this time around to go to print right after the campaign than we were for Darkrock Ventures, and pending the Enhancements (Stretch Goals, etc.) we will be able to produce and ship with a more realistic target turnaround. \n\n2. We are proud to be working with Panda Game Manufacturing again, the same manufacturing industry veterans Gamelyn Games, among others, have used to create their previous projects. This is the same manufacturer with whom we worked for Darkrock Ventures. We have a great relationship with their team and we are now even more familiar with their production requirements, timelines, payment schedules, communication methods, freight arrangements, and customs fees. Together, we have accomplished great things and we know that Fire of Eidolon will be just as outstanding!\n\n3. Professional distribution is already in place, and we are proud to say it will be handled once again by Ship Naked. They have been responsible for the fulfillment of previous Gamelyn Games/Magic Meeple Games titles. All of which were delivered reliably and professionally. Ship Naked has proven to be communicative, punctual, and customer service minded. They are responsible for our new shipping schedule, with is now even MORE cost-effective for backers outside the USA!\n\nDuring the manufacturing of Darkrock Ventures there was a technology failure that caused a delay. Things such as this sometimes cannot be helped no matter how prepared you may be. No project is immune to the possible mishap, but this road is familiar to us, our distributor, and our manufacturer (who made up for it by upgrading DRV's box for us!) and we are confident in our ability to deliver our products to our backers and fans. \n\nThank you for your confidence and support!\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAbove all, We are 100% dedicated to customer service and backer communication. We will be transparent with our process, and involve our backers as much as possible.\n\nWe will be present DAILY during the project to answer any questions or read any comments and we will provide regular updates and supply photos of the progress when possible.\n\nThank you for your trust in us! We couldn't do it without you! Look what we accomplished together with DRV! Let's bring Fire of Eidolon to the gaming world, too!\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPrevious Project Status\nDarkrock Ventures : 200%+ Funded via Kickstarter, Fully Manufactured, All Invoices Paid, Currently shipping to Backers (as of 7/11/2016)\nSlated to release as official DLC on TableTopia and Tabletop Simulator.\n\nDarkrock Ventures Expansion Pack #1 : Fully Manufactured, All Invoices Paid, Currently Shipping, to be available on BGG store Q3 2016.\n\nOur backers make our games possible!

Fight to the finish using custom-built hands of cards, combining powerful attacks, clever tactics, and epic finishing moves. Take command of one of four unique robots, pair it with your favorite pilot, and smash your opponents across a fully destructible city.\n  The final sculpts are all pending approval and are subject to refinement and change.\n    The digital lore and art book Giga-Robo! The Zoider War is now included free for every backer! You can still help support the campaign in these last hours by:  \nSharing our top pinned post on Facebook  \nRetweeting this tweet on Twitter  \nBecoming a fan on Board Game Geek  \nOn top of that, 5 lucky randomly selected backers will receive a hardcover physical copy of the book!\n  Giga-Shards: These techno-organic energy sources are grown and lethally harvested from living beings. When harvested from humans, the Shards grant their users the incredible ability to transmute emotion into unbridled power, limited only by the user\u2019s fighting spirit. The Zoider Armada\u2014an omnipotent alien force that glorifies conquest above all else\u2014has discovered this unique power. Now the various Zoider factions have invaded Earth space to abduct and dominate the human race. Earth is given a chance to fight back when a few brave humans escape Zoider captivity, sacrificing themselves to send Zoider\u2019s giant robot prototypes back to Earth. But the pilots who come into the possession of these titanic war machines have goals of their own. Some selfish and some selfless, they compete with each other in a race to control more Giga-Shards. Some hope to defend Earth, while others seek only power to achieve their own mysterious ends.\n      DEEP CUSTOMIZATION AND STRATEGY \nChoose from a powerful roster of pilots and robots, each with unique stats, styles, and alternative forms, to create a wide variety of play styles. Each Pilot and Robot has its own deck of Attack and Instant cards. Choose 15 of them to build your hand. \nCustomize your robot by installing 3 abilities that can be used and triggered mid-game to turn the tide of battle. Select a new hand each game, or swap out your Pilot or Robot for a whole new set of possibilities, ensuring great replayability, personalization, and strategic variation.\nDYNAMIC DICE AND CARD COMBAT\nRoll fistfuls of dice against your opponent for over-the-top card-based attacks, powered by your Pilot's Fighting Spirit, and balanced by map position, strategic card play, and hand construction. You never draw cards from a deck, so the combos and combat cycles you design are always at your fingertips. \nEvery time your opponent moves, plays a card, or resolves a dice roll, you can respond and counter with cards of your own. The battle is constant, dramatic, and engaging\u2014you never have to wait for your turn to get in on the action.\nCOLLATERAL DAMAGE  \nEvery piece of terrain is fully destructible, revealing new hazards as you smash through the city. Use an exposed conduit from the city's power grid to charge your next attack. Throw your opponent through a skyscraper, leaving a blazing inferno in its wake. Strike the ground beneath your opponent\u2019s feet, sending them crashing down into a massive crater. Combat is never static\u2014your attacks push, pull, and throw your opponent across the map and through every hazard you can find.\nDOWN BUT NEVER OUT  \nEvery time your opponent inflicts damage to your robot, you gain resources based on your Pilot\u2019s Rage and Power, giving way to stunning comeback moves and ever-shifting momentum.\nTHE COOLDOWN METER\nTiming is essential; every time you play a card, it enters your Cooldown Meter and you won\u2019t be able to use it again for a set number of turns. Some cards have powerful buffs that Activate once they\u2019re in Cooldown. \nThe Cooldown Meter also controls how long you\u2019re hindered by the negative effects of Trauma Tokens\u2014components that show the consequences of your opponent's most devastating attacks, and the effects of pushing your robot beyond its limits.\nWatch a full playthrough of the game!\nPlay Giga-Robo right now on Tabletopia!\nThis is a ready-to-play demo of Giga-Robo, for 1-4 players!\n    Click here to read the full review!\n   The Cardboard Dungeon's preview of Giga-Robo.\nUndead Viking reviews Giga-Robo.\n  (Components shown above are not rendered to scale)\nBoth the EARLY BIRD and GIGA CORE Reward tiers include the Giga-Robo Core set (pictured above), the Bonus Pilot, Med'racht Singh, and all applicable stretchgoals.\nThe GIGA PREMIUM Reward tier includes all of the above, except the miniatures in the Core set come pre-painted!

His deck features lots of counters and catch-up tactics, as well as straightforward stat boosting abilities and control strategies.\nDash in his cockpit, using his supernatural machine mastery to maneuver his mecha.\nHADRIAN CORTO\nHadrian features powerful defensive tactics, Cooldown Meter manipulation, and overall balanced stats. His robot engineering skills manifest with the unique ability to permanently gain extra mobility and abilities by removing cards from the game.\nHadrian, piloting his robot using the interface in his cybernetic arm, while making modifications on the fly.\nNORIKO NAGARE\nNoriko can dynamically alter, enhance, and extend her attacks, allowing for a very adaptive approach to combat. Amongst other high risk abilities that allow for very aggressive strategies and comebacks, she can also sacrifice her robot's Armor to gain resources.\nNoriko in full armor, dialed in, razor focused, and ready to launch.\nTAKASHI KATO\nTakashi's constant combat playstyle allows you to stay in your opponent's face, with very reactive stats, and tactics that reward you for taking damage. His deck also strongly focuses on boosting damage and die rolls.\nTakashi uses full-body motion control, so his robot can mimic his fighting skills perfectly.\n    Game Designer and Art Director: Alex Cheng\nCo-Developer: Steven Hammerschlag\nLead Artist: Mark Henry Bustamante\nLead Sculptor: Matt Molen\nChief Mechanical Designer: Andrew Chan\nLead Playtesters: Eric Buscemi and Jason Stapleton\nGiga-Robo has been in full-time development since early 2014 and, as of 7/6/2016, has accumulated 226 public playtest hours through demos, blind playtests, and most recently a 6-month-long closed beta with testers in the USA and Canada.

All signs and portents point to this momentous night, and you and your siblings of shadow stand ready. Your cult has sacrificed much - and many - to prepare the ceremony to awaken the dread god whose name twists your tongue and whose dark purpose twists your mind. But this night is one of great power, and your lodge is not the only one who seeks to harness that power. Other cultists prepare similar yet horribly different ceremonies, and investigators roam the streets and locales of Arkham, seeking to stop the inevitable annihilation. You must strike now, before a cult of a different old one ushers in their own maddening end times. In your hands lies the Fate of the Elder Gods!\nIn Fate of the Elder Gods, 1-4 players take on the ever-maddening role of cults trying to summon ancient evil and herald the fall of mankind! Each cult is competing to be first to summon their god, but they must also repel intrepid investigators working to seal off the gate to beyond with Elder Signs. Gather arcane artifacts, cast powerful spells, embrace the Dark Gift of your Elder God, and be first to awaken your dread master... before it's too late!\nDuring the game, players use a variable hand of spell cards to aid their cult in their mission. Use a spell's Astral Symbol to navigate the areas around Arkham on the unique Fate Clock board, and activate symbols in a location's Astral Column to ready powerful spells. Readied spells can be cast at any time and their Astral Symbols aid in readying future spells while in a cult's Spell Reserve, creating an engine for harnessing even greater power.\nAs cults travel to the six locations on the Fate Clock, they activate specific powerful abilities, such as gaining useful artifacts at The Museum or enabling their Elder God's Dark Gift at The Ceremony. As a cult sends more and more cultists to a location, they can take control of that location, gaining far more powerful abilities. However, cults must be careful when navigating Arkham, as a location with lots of activity will attract pesky investigators. Tempt fate too many times and the investigators may raid your cult's lodge, place Elder Signs, and forestall the summoning of your Elder God. If a cult gains too many Elder Signs, it's game over!\nIf any cult manages to raise their Summon Track to 9 before the investigators save humanity, their Elder God awakens and they win! Of course, \"win\" is a relative term as it will certainly herald the end of the world, or at least destroy Arkham, but that's a small price to pay for eternal servitude to the Ancient Ones.\n  Fate of the Elder Gods comes with a beautiful Fate Clock board, custom screen-printed dice, cards and panels for spells, curses, and more, and over 100 gorgeous miniatures! Here's a complete run-down:\n19 inch by 22 inch (480x550mm) custom-cut, quad-fold playing board\n80 sculpted plastic Cultists (in 4 player colors - purple, green, yellow, and black)\n25 sculpted plastic Investigators\n2 sculpted plastic Cthulhu Fate Piece markers\n65 Euro mini-sized Spell cards with linen finish\n20 square Artifact cards with linen finish\n20 Euro mini-sized Curse cards with linen finish\n16 Euro mini-sized Gate cards with linen finish\n8 player reference cards\n8 Elder God Lodge boards in fine card stock (Cthulhu, Yog-Sothoth, Nyarlathotep, Tsatthogua, Bokrug, Ithaqua, Atlach-Nacha, Hastur)\n8 Elder God Selection cards\n10 custom resin dice\n4 wooden Summon Track tokens (in 4 player colors)\n40 thick punchboard Elder Signs\n6 thick punchboard Squall tokens (for Ithaqua's Dark Gift)\n18-page full color glossy rulebook\n  From the very start of this project, we all envisioned a top-notch production that would make the game wholly immersive for every player. Drawing inspiration from older classics like Twilight Imperium 3 and newer games such as Blood Rage, we turned to the talented team of artist Jorge Ramos and veteran sculptor Chad Hoverter to create some truly awesome minis to represent the Cultists, Investigators, and the impressive Fate Piece for Fate of the Elder Gods.\nWe wanted a very distinctive Cultist for the base sculpt. Since we were going to be basing the Fate Piece around Lovecraftian-classic Elder God Cthulhu, Jorge chose to entwine the two designs and craft the cult's tall hood around the kraken-esque crest from his Cthulhu sculpt. The tentacle embellishments on the sleeves and hoods just make this Cultist even more awesome, and Chad executed it all perfectly.\nWe gave Jorge some 20s, 30s, and 40s fashion directives, but this rendition of the plucky Investigator is all his vision. Chad added his distinctive flair to really bring this sculpt of the woman of action and investigation to life.\nOur only direction to Jorge for this Fate Piece statue was to take Cthulhu in a unique direction. His vision of a kraken-like Cthulhu complete with spiky carapace certainly set it apart from the typical bulbous-headed predecessors. Chad added his signature dramatic flair, making this statue even more menacing.\n  There are a lot of cool things about Fate of the Elder Gods, but the heart of it all is the Fate Clock game board. Cults will use spells to move the Fate Piece around the Clock to a location, activating that spot's special action and - if they happen to have control - an extra action that can grant a huge boon. The physical Fate Clock will be a custom-cut quad-fold board that will have an amazing presence on any gaming table.\n    If videos aren't your thing, or you'd like to delve deeper into how to play Fate of the Elder Gods, download and peruse the latest version of the preliminary rules that were provided to our playtesters and reviewers right here!\nYou can also watch a full game of Fate of the Elder Gods played by the designers at Gen Con 2016!\n  \"Fate of the Elder Gods is one of the best games I have ever designed. It is a work far greater than I would have achieved alone because I believe teaming up with Darrell and Chris brought out the best ideas from each of us, making the whole much greater than any of the individual parts, and creating a game experience far beyond my initial vision.\" - Richard Launius, co-designer of Fate of the Elder Gods\nReview of Fate of the Elder Gods by Joel Eddy of Drive Thru Review!\n Review of Fate of the Elder Gods by Kevin and Melissa of Tantrum House!\n\"I had a ton of fun playing Fate of the Elder Gods and was looking forward to more plays during the convention. I was faced with tough decision like whether I wanted to use spell cards for movement or try to ready them for use, to use my readied spells or save them to add to my pool of symbols to ready more spells, should I activate a location with an action I desperately wanted to take or one with symbols that will allow me to ready a spell I really wanted to have on hand. There definitely seemed to be different paths to victory and tons of replayability due to the variety of Elder God\u2019s to choose from. I will definitely be backing the Kickstarter and eagerly await another chance to summon an Elder God and bring about the fall of mankind.\" - Dan Licata, review on BoardGameGeek.com\n\"I played a four player and two player game with the near-final prototype. The unique abilities of each elder god really mixes up the strategies and makes you approach the game differently each time. This variable play, mixed with a solid core of mechanics and an epic end game, makes Fate of the Elder Gods a great game.\" - Bryan Fischer, Nevermore Games\nFate of the Elder Gods is a distinguished alum of the Unpub program - a series of public and private playtest events held each year to help designers present, hone and polish their game designs with the gaming public, as well as board game production professionals.\n      This 3-foot x 3-foot vinyl playmat can bring even more awesomeness to your gaming sessions of Fate of the Elder Gods! If you'd like to add this playmat to your pledge, simply add an additional $39 to your pledge level and we will clarify your order after the campaign concludes. Please note that any pledges for the ELDER GOD pledge level include the playmat, so you can get all the things for $199!\nAchieving our base funding goal will ensure that Greater Than Games will be able to publish Fate of the Elder Gods at the quality that we all have come to expect. The base game of Fate of the Elder Gods is priced according to our initial funding goal; if we are able to exceed that then we can afford to upgrade some game components and add in a lot of other really cool stuff... including monsters! The Mi-Go and Ghatanothoa mentioned below will not be in the retail base game; if we unlock enough stretch goals beyond them, though, we can produce a whole beastly expansion that Kickstarter backers will get for free! \n     Every backer of Fate of the Elder Gods will receive the special promotional Elder God, Azathoth, not included in the retail version of the game. As the ruler of the Outer Gods, Azathoth's greatness is reflected in the special passive ability of his Dark Gift - Elder Signs only make him more powerful! When serving Azathoth you'll be begging other Cults to visit the Streets of Arkham and send those pesky Investigators your way to Hasten Doom!\nBackers at the Cultist level and above will also receive the special pack of promotional Cult cards that grant even more powers from your Ancient One!\nThese cards can be optionally added to any game. There is a Cult card for every god in the base game, as well as Cult cards for Azathoth and any of the gods that are unlocked through stretch goals. There are even a couple of unaligned Cult cards for even more variety! This promotional pack will not be available in retail and is a little something special to say thanks for supporting the Kickstarter.\nDark Gift\nBackers at the Dark Gift pledge level will receive a special hardcover book, Forbidden Lore: Uncovering Fate of the Elder Gods, filled with over 50 glossy, full-color pages of awesome Lovecraftian goodness! Inside this tome you'll find a ton of behind-the-scenes information on the art production process, including preliminary sketches and final pieces for the locations, miniatures, Elder God portraits, and more. You'll also uncover the literary histories of the Elder Gods and more deep facts about the history of Arkham and its mysteries. Forbidden Lore will include three of the designers' personal favorite Lovecraft stories - The Whisperer in Darkness, At The Mountains of Madness, and The Shadow Over Innsmouth - with special illustrations!\n Elder God\nBackers at the Elder God pledge level will receive the book, Forbidden Lore: Uncovering Fate of the Elder Gods, as well as a copy of Fate of the Elder Gods signed and numbered by designers Richard Launius, Darrell Louder, and Chris Kirkman! Backers will also receive the special 3-foot x 3-foot vinyl playmat, and two limited edition, 24\" x 36\" canvas prints of the art pieces for The Ceremony and Streets of Arkham, signed and numbered by artist Nolan Nasser!\n  Fate of the Elder Gods is truly a project of passion, born from a group of creators who not only have a love of boardgames but also a love for the Lovecraftian lore that surrounds the game.\nCall him the Duke of Dice, the Titan of Theme, or just King Launius; Richard has been designing and championing boardgames that tell good stories for 30 years, ever since his classic hit Arkham Horror was first released in 1987. Richard is known for his other great game designs, such as Defenders of the Realm, Elder Sign, Dragon Rampage, Cthulhu's Vault - a Lovecraft storytelling game, and more.\nDarrell is a graphic designer, multimedia director, father, science geek, grilling enthusiast, and game designer from Dover, Delaware. Darrell counts himself blessed; his best-selling first design, the chemistry game Compounded, is currently in its fourth printing, and his baseball game, Bottom of the 9th, is already headed to its third. His former knowledge of the Cthulhu Mythos was fairly limited, but now considers himself an expert by osmosis after developing Fate of the Elder Gods with Richard and Chris.\nChris was born with boardgames in his blood and has been designing and developing games - both digital and analog - for over 30 years. Chris is founder of Dice Hate Me Games, and serves as Game Development Director at Greater Than Games, where he scouts for new and awesome things and then helps to make them even awesomer. The only thing he loves as much as gaming is the Cthulhu Mythos, so this project is a dream come true.\nNolan\u2019s career in board game illustration is relatively young, but the pure passion for his craft has quickly made him a rising star. Nolan has worked with the Greater Than Games team on three past projects - Spirit Island, New Bedford, and Exoplanets - using his talents for digital painting to craft those gaming worlds. Nolan is responsible for crafting the landscapes in Fate of the Elder Gods, creating the art for the Fate Clock locations, as well as the gorgeous game cover.\nJorge is a concept artist from Madrid, Spain with an incredible talent for character illustration. Jorge worked with the Greater Than Games team on Spirit Island, creating the incredible visages of the island's many protector spirits, and did character design for the ship captains and salty sea-dogs of New Bedford as well. Jorge is responsible for the character and monster concept sketches for miniature sculpting reference, as well as the awesome Elder Gods illustrations.\nChad is a veteran miniature sculptor from Dallas, Texas who has been a part of many projects in the boardgame world. Some of his most recent and well-known projects are sculpts for Mice & Mystics, Tailfeathers, and Specter Ops. He is, of course, responsible for all the sculpts in Fate of the Elder Gods, including the monsters... provided we fund high enough!\nFor US and Canadian backers, we are offering free shipping.

Many boardgame projects on Kickstarter have been seriously hampered by art production delays, problems with an overseas factory, missing units and one shipping snafu after another.\n\nLuckily, we have a few projects under our belt, and have dealt with many of those snags along the way. We try to plan for all contingencies, and we've been fairly successful with that in our past projects.\n\nWe won't lie - stuff happens. Delays can occur. Sometimes you have to go back and forth on color samples six times just to get the color right, and even then the color isn't perfect.

But most people haven\u2019t stopped drinking it. They are a thirsty lot and as it turns out there are people who can quench that thirst, small family operations up the creeks and hollows of Tennessee and North Carolina making Batches of White Lightning whiskey in their hillside stills, White Lightning that they can drive down the mountains in very fast cars to the towns and cities below. However there is a threat: the law, State Sheriffs and Revenue Men who want to shut the bootleggers down or at least get a piece of the action.  \nWhat's it all About?\nFrom the back hollows of the Smokey Mountains to the big cities of Atlanta, Knoxville, and Chattanooga your job is to run boxes of White Lightning whiskey to build a bootlegging empire. If you can keep the money coming, you can cook up more White Lightning and buy another still or maybe even another car to expand your empire across four states before the other players do. \n                                     But Watch Out!\nThe sheriffs and revenuers are out to get you!   They\u2019ll use anything and everything to run you down, catching your bumper with a hook, shooting out your tires or radiator, or even ramming you. If you get caught you'll have to pay a bribe or lose what you have. \nTo get past them, to go faster and out run them you'll need to soup up your car with a dual carburetor or add a steel plate to the radiator or maybe even have a driver who can do a bootlegger turn. Choosing which highways or roads you will take or which towns or cities you will run whiskey to, is one of the many problems you will be faced with in trying to build the richest empire ahead of the other players.\nOf course with the sheriffs and revenuers moving up and down the highways and roads you will be faced with choices: what is the safest and fastest route to get your White Lightning to market, where will you hide the next still you build, what new modifications should you do to your car?\nWhite Lightning is a two to four player game where you run a bootlegging operation of stills and cars in the Smokey Mountains to dry towns and cities across four states. You are competing against the other players to build a bootlegging empire that has the highest market value and do it all in 15 turns. \nThe four sheriffs and three revenuers are moved independently of the players by Movement Cards. You don't know which direction they're going to go next, so you'll have to find a way around them as well as the other players to build and hold your network of the towns and cities together until the end of the game.   \n                                                          Be Careful!  \n A player could sell White Lightning to a city or town you already control and steal it right out from under your nose or worse buy a shotgun and start robbing you or your still of its precious White Lightning.\nGetting Started\nEach bootlegger starts with a Ford Model A, a Still, $50 and a driver you draw from a deck of cards. After establishing a still site, you spend $25 to make your first batch of White Lightning. Then with the case of whiskey in your trunk, you decide where you want to sell it and how you want to get there and back without running into a Sheriff or Revenuer. \n  Once you begin to make money, you can continue to buy corn and sugar to make more White Lightning and start making improvements on your car or even buy another, faster car.  At the same time you can start expanding to cities that pay more for White Lightning.  More cash and more improvements, these will make or break your empire.\n As the game progresses you have to hold onto your towns and cities and not let them fall into another player's hands, trying to keep the highest market value while expanding your whiskey output across four states.\n  Then there is the law. They are out there to slow down or stop your expansion and when they do the other players can fill the vacuum taking over the towns and cities you control. And even if you do avoid the sheriffs and revenuers there are always snitches who will alert the authorities of your car or still's whereabouts. And finally there is the chance that a player\u2019s empire is too big and needs closer scrutiny to Bust the Syndicate!\n\n\nWhat's in the Box?\nWhite Lightning comes with everything you need to play the game.\n               Large 19\" x 29\" Game Board\nHighlights\nThe game has sheriffs and revenuers who move by Movement Cards to try and catch the players as they bootleg White Lightning to the towns and cities across the map. If they catch you there are Action Cards played against the bootlegger's car maybe shooting out your tires or hooking onto your bumper and pulling you to a stop. There are many routes made up of fast highways and slower roads in order to supply the towns and cities and avoid the Sheriffs and Revenuers. To win you must put together combinations of villages, towns, and cities with enough market value to beat the other players.  Beware.  The market values change if another player challenges your hold on it. Each player must balance their Ledger sheet buying corn and sugar for making whiskey, buying stills, buying modifications for their cars, and buying more cars in order to expand their empire. There are up to seven modifications for the cars from moving faster to avoiding attacks by the sheriff and revenuers when you are chased or to carrying more White Lightning or carrying a shotgun to rob or protect yourself from robbery.\nStrategies include:\nCobbling together and holding a winning bootleg empire of towns and cites that produce the highest return for White Lightning\nStealing towns and cities from other players\nAvoiding the Sheriffs and Revenuers who move independently around the board and chase any bootlegger they see\nAssembling a car that is fast or protected and cannot be chased down by the Sheriffs, Revenuers or other bootleggers\nUsing driver talents that you draw from the Driver Deck to strengthen your empire\nRobbing other bootleggers of their White Lightning as they produce it or try to smuggle it to towns and cities\nPlacing stills on the best creeks in the mountains where they are least likely to be detected but close enough to the best towns and cities\nHiding your still to lower the risk of being spotted by a passing Sheriff or Revenuer\nEscaping the dreaded Snitch who might reveal where your car is going or where you still is located.\nBut Didn't Prohibition End?\nYes indeed it did, but not the White Lightning.  It turned out the thirsty people had grown used to whiskey being cheap and that it was exciting to drink something that was still illegal and so they kept buying it and the Sheriffs and Revenuers kept trying to stop it. Well past the end of prohibition,bootlegging continued captured by the time period of this game.\nWhy KICKSTARTER?\nThis is the first of a series of games that we are developing that capture unique American culture and history that we think has been overlooked. Through Kickstarter we hope to attract a community of people that will help us explore new genres with game mechanics that are exceptional enough to make it stand out but at the same time very playable and balanced and with excellent artwork.

Whether you pledged on day one or you pledge on the last day you will receive these! If you are getting 3 full games, you also get 3 sets of stretch goal rewards!\n*the only tier not eligible for stretch goal rewards is the first ($16) tier, which was created exclusively for the purpose of reducing shipping cost to international backers.\nOrganATTACK! brings to life medical and pseudoscientific concepts in a twisted, hilarious, very fun, and surprisingly educational card game for anyone who owns organs.*\n\nDeveloped, designed and illustrated by The Awkward Yeti, creator of four successful Kickstarter campaigns,* including this one to make Heart and Brain plush toys. Awkward Yeti comics reach millions each month on the web, including a portion of 1.2 million Facebook fans. (*100% of The Awkward Yeti's campaigns have reached or exceeded their goals!)\nA beta test was held with about 30 participants to help refine the game\n  Gallbladder's Last Day\nThe Awkward Yeti is the New York Times best selling cartoonist behind Heart and Brain, as well as the cartoonist behind Lars on LINE Webtoon, Medical Tales Retold on Tapastic, and a variety of viral comics. A great deal of care was applied to the development of the game over the past year - making sure there was a good balance between randomness and strategy, that the medical themes are often informative but requires absolutely no medical understanding, and that the representations of characters were true to the comics.\nI've been wanting to make a board game for much longer than that, but could never quite figure out the details. With card games seemingly making a comeback (or at least with me becoming aware of this comeback last year) I started thinking of ways I could simplify my mindset. One day I went for a run, accidentally forgetting my headphones at home, forcing me to use my brain for entertainment. That's when I came up with the initial concept for the card game in its entirety. All during one run. Since then of course I spent countless hours developing and re-developing that concept, and that's where we are now...\nAbout the Game\nThe object of the game is to remove your opponents' organs using corresponding afflictions before they remove yours. The last person to still have at least one organ is the winner.\nIn addition to Affliction cards (like Pancreatitis, which can be played on either Gallbladder or Pancreas), the game has instant defensive cards, and lots of crazy tactical moves that shake things up. What you end up with is a pretty fast-paced, very fun, and often intense gameplay that's suitable for all levels of players.\nThe game is best enjoyed by 2-5 players.\n\nORGAN DECK (20 cards):\nThere are 19 organs in the deck, plus one Organ WILD card. The 19 organs were chosen based on the most used Awkward Yeti characters, and include most of the major organs like Heart and Brain, as well as fan favorites like Tongue and Teeth. \nOrgans require 2 afflictions for removal and the Organ WILD requires 4 afflictions for removal (however, it is susceptible to any affliction card)\nATTACK DECK (72 cards):\nAfflictions: It takes two corresponding afflictions to remove an opponent's organ. Afflictions match up with one or more organs and can only be played on that organ (unless you play it along with Metastasis, which turns an Affliction into a Wild)\nWilds: Wilds can be played as one affliction on any organ, except for Necrosis Wild cards, which instantly remove an organ\nResistance: Defensive cards that resist attacks or instantly block attacks\nTactical and Bureaucracy: These cards shake the game up in a variety of ways. For example, \"Kidnapped\" allows you to take an opponent's organ for yourself. \"Sedate\" skips an opponent for two turns, etc\nPoisoned: As soon as the card is drawn, the player must remove one of his/her own organs.\nThe two decks will be packaged side by side in a nice box along with the rule book (I will update as I have more specific info/design available)\nHyperthyroidism\nAbout the Kickstarter\nSome specifics are subject to change\nThe Awkward Yeti has successfully completed multiple Kickstarter campaigns to raise money for new projects, including this campaign for Heart and Brain plush toys. Without these campaigns, major product launches simply would not be possible. It's one of the best ways to show support for a webcomic cartoonist!\nThe game has been in development for about a year and has been through multiple revisions and a full beta test, so it should be ready for production within a few weeks of the Kickstarter's end (pending any improvements).\nThe goal was set to be the minimum amount I believe will be needed for production of the game, shipping to backers, and Kickstarter and credit card fees. I am prepared to cover additional fees myself if necessary. Of course, there's great hope that it will go well beyond the goal!\nNote: Backers are charged AFTER the Kickstarter ends, ONLY IF the original goal is met.\nThe game should be produced and shipped out to backers before the winter holidays, so keep it in mind as a gift!\nSHIPPING RATES: These have been calculated based on the lowest USPS rates available to us after their recent price increases. These were calculated based on estimated weights, which will exceed the low weight threshold of 13oz. Higher tiers have been given discounted shipping due to the amount pledged.\nGoals:\nThe more money we raise, the lower the price per game will be, and that means room for bonuses! Here's what Kickstarter backers can expect at each level (goals in color have been reached):\n  We hit the goal in less than an hour! WOW!\n  Enjoy your stickers!\n  ooh la la, these games will look nice!\n  The gift will be a set of customized Poker cards! All backers at a $20 tier or higher will receive this at no extra charge!

It's a quick, intense chase between the Fugitive, who is trying to get out of town, and the Marshal, who is trying to catch him before he does.  \nHunter or Prey - each side plays very differently.\nDeduction - using a simple set of numbered cards, you have to deduce where the Fugitive's hideouts are located.\nBluffing - You can feign large jumps to throw the Marshal off your trail.\nEasy to Learn - Read the Rules or Watch this how to play video. Spanish here. Chinese here. Russian Here. Italian here. French here. Portuguese here. German here.\n Here is what's included:\nStylish briefcase box - thick stock\n43 hideout cards - UNIQUE original art on each card\n10 event cards\n2 Player Role cards\n3 Pile Marker cards\nLaminated Notecard for Marshal to take notes\nDry Erase Marker\nInstructions\nI had some players ask for a follow up for Burgle Bros with the escape - getting out of town with the loot!  So with Fugitive I wanted to give the feeling of 'The Chase' - being on the run from an unstoppable force after you. Two goals were to build it on very basic elements and be short. It ended up with just numbered cards and only 10 minutes to play.\nI like two player games with different roles, but still in conflict, like Netrunner.  Using guessing games is not common, but I found it creates a good tension like guessing your opponent in Poker. Don't worry if you start out blindly guessing as the Marshal - your information builds quickly and you can start deducing a lot.  Feel free to try it out with numbered cards in other games(6 Nimmit/Category 5/'The Game') or the print and play files here.  I hope you enjoy it!\nUPDATE: I ran an AMA question-and-answer session on reddit. Head over there to read my responses.\nA note from Ryan Goldsberry, the illustrator:\nThe first time Tim played Fugitive with me, we only used blank cards with numbers. Despite having absolutely no art, the feeling of being chased and the tension of close calls and escapes was so strong that I knew the art would have to be freaking sweet in order to live up to the feel of playing the game. It was decided that the coolest thing to do would be to draw this out as one long chase. In my mind I was imagining a movie where the Fugitive is making crazy almost reckless moves to escape but the Marshall is pursuing him relentlessly...like the Terminator!\nHopefully the art will live up to this feeling. Each card will be original and unique. They will be presented sequentially, like reading a comic book. It is my goal that you could lay out all the cards, from beginning to end, and watch an entire chase happen. Maybe even imagine the conversations and thoughts that are going through each characters mind. I hope you'll love the game! I have a lot of cards to paint, and I'm working like a maniac right now to get it done.\n  \"Two games in one! As the Fugitive you play a bluffing game, trying to keep yourself one step away from capture. As the Marshal you are solving a puzzle while gathering clues and attempting to think like your quarry.\nGameplay is quick and tense, and many games come down to wire. Even after playing several games we are still exploring different strategies. Should I sprint to throw the Marshal off my trail, or move slowly and force her to make a lot of guesses? Should I draw clues from nearby locations to narrow the Fugitives choices, or take them from farther away to choke off his escape routes in the end game?\nA unique 10-minute game that I would recommend for anyone who enjoys logic puzzles, searching for clues, and outwitting your opponent.\" - Stone Librande\n\"Fugutive does an amazing job recreating that classic, high-octane, on-the-run chase, without sacrificing strategy. Easy to learn and simple to teach; it sets up in seconds, yet Fugitive somehow still feels meaty and deeply strategic. Replayability is strong too, thanks to those randomly selected event cards blended into each new game. It was an instant hit both as a gateway with my less experienced friends, and as a filler for veteran gamers. I have a feeling Fugitive will make it to my table regularly.\" - Bob Buechler\n \"I have to say, I'm pretty enamored with Fugitive. It offers a single-serving logic puzzle that two people are simultaneously trying to solve to mutually-exclusive ends, and that's something I've simply never seen before. The table dynamic generates genuine tension in the best way, and I can't wait to see how the Event cards will change the balance of things. And more than all that, it's just damn fun. I'm really excited for this one.\" - Gameosity  \n\"Whether you catch your perp or get away scott-free, Fugitive is a clever little card game whose potential is easily more than the sum of its parts. Its short play time and diametrically opposing roles affords you an entirely different feeling depending on which side of the table you\u2019re on. Against a fitting visual aesthetic, Fugitive has ample room for bluffing, number crunching, and continually trying to get as much of an advantage on your opponent as you can. At its most basic Fugitive is a short and straightforward abstract card game, but it is admirable how often the game\u2019s premise winds its way into the experience all the same.\" - Cardboard Republic\n\"I think Fugitive is an excellent game for two. It plays fairly quickly and I love the cat-and-mouse mind games that go on. I\u2019ve been a fan of Tim Fowers\u2019 other game designs, and I like the thematic tie-in to Burgle Bros., too.\" - Geek Dad\n\"Fugitive es un juego de los que te hacen cosquillitas por dentro cuando lo pruebas.

The team is composed of the following folks:\n This Kickstarter is the result of 11 months of work. From the idea, to the first home made prototype, the first play-tests, the first art, the first printed prototype, the many request for quotes from China, Poland, Germany, packages sent to reviewers and influencer in order for them to test, video and write about our game, the 200 iterations on the art, the communication, the page, newsletter, giveaway, forums and the 100s of pitch and play-test at conventions. \n This Kickstarter is the first creative cooperation of 2 brothers supported by the art of the amazing Mateusz Komada and the original art of Radek Bolkowski. \n We are grateful for you to be here. We hope you enjoy this game!  \n    To the amazing EVERYDAYiPLAY's team for allowing us to bring to tabletop this beautiful license. Your availability and eagerness to make this project happen has been a huge source of inspiration. To George Monnat Jr and Rob Harper for being so pro-active and effective in proof-reading the game rules. To all the play-testers who helped make that game what it is today. A fun and balanced deck-building resource management game! To our families for the amazing amount of support helping us fulfill a childhood dream of creating tabletop games!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWith over 10 months of conception and 100 blind play-tests, the game has gone through an intense level of proof-reading, testing and printing preparation.\n\nCards and wood pieces being the main components of Vikings Gone Wild means that this project has a lower level of risk than others, particularly those with lots of miniatures.\nThat being said, outside of making sure that the game is properly prepared and choosing our partners wisely (printers, logistics, etc.), it is not impossible that we face delays from uncontrollable sources. This may cause some delay in the delivery date but rest assured that, if this were to happen, we will keep you informed about the situation.\n\nRefund Policy\n\nAll pledges can be refunded up to the completion of the Pledge Manager, no questions asked.\nIf the refund is asked more than 60 days after the end of the Kickstarter campaign, 10% will be deducted from the amount (corresponding to the charges incurred by Kickstarter and Stripe, since we will not be refunded of them at that point), and the refund will have to be done via PayPal instead of the Credit Card you used on Stripe.\n\nTerms and Condition\n\nAny costs shown in EUR are based on the exchange rate in effect during the first day of the campaign.\nBy pledging to this Kickstarter, you acknowledge that the final appearance, materials and content of the rewards (and the Kickstarter) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented while the Kickstarter project is active.\n\nYou agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods.

With years of experience in video production\u2014working with folks like Epic Games, Harmonix, SpryFox, Polygon, and TakeThis.org\u2014Russ is a storyteller first and foremost, trusted by game makers and other creative types to tell complex stories in genuine and relatable ways. Which is why he\u2019s the person we trust to tell our story. Bionic Trousers will still have creative control of the project, but we wouldn\u2019t want anyone but Russ to produce it.\nThe Desert Bus for Hope Documentary [uninspired working title] would cover the history of the event, from its humble beginning in our living room, to the week-long production it\u2019s become, and it will take you behind the scenes of the months of hard work that will go into producing Desert Bus for Hope 10.\nWe think DBFH is a wholly unique event, and we believe it deserves documentation. The 10th anniversary event makes the most sense, both as a milestone, and as an appropriate time to look back on what brought us here.\nFurthermore, we hope that this documentary will inspire others to do good. We started so small, just wanting to do something nice, and through the support of an amazing community we accidentally created something giant and wonderful. We hope that this documentary will showcase what is possible when a community bands together to do good things.\nPhotos: Andrew Ferguson\nThis documentary project is not for profit\u2014we don\u2019t want or expect to make money from this.\nIn fact, we believe in this project so much, that Bionic Trousers is funding the first $30,000 ourselves. This campaign is for the remaining amount. You can read a detailed funding breakdown below.\nWe want this project to be seen\u2014distribution will not be limited to Kickstarter backers. However, backers will have access to an early release. \nPhysical copies (DVD or BluRay) will be available for purchase after the project is completed, and we will investigate digital distribution options for the physical media's special features.\nIf you're in the US, this project is asking for what appears like way more money than it actually is, because we are based in Canada, and the Canadian dollar is pretty crap right now. We're actually asking for around $65,000 USD, but converted into CAD (and factoring in the Kickstarter fees, and producing physical rewards) that's $92,000 CAD. We realize the sticker shock isn't great, but just think how far your US dollars will go!\nNote: All rewards higher than $6 receive thanks in the credits, and all rewards higher than $12 get to \"attend\" the digital premiere. Other rewards are as written.\nCards Against Humanity, Cards For The Children\nLoadingReadyRun and Cards Against Humanity are going to team-up to write a 15-card pack, entirely Desert Bus themed!

While the design will be revealed during the campaign, enjoy these examples of Michael's previous Desert Bus work.\nKickstarter Exclusive Fangamer Shirt\nSince Desert Bus 5 the wonderful folks at Fangamer have provided the official, gorgeous DBFH t-shirts, and they're doing one just for this campaign!

Bredon beat me handily in all five games we played, but I am proud to say that he never beat me the same way twice.\" -Kvothe\nNews Flash: We've cracked the $1M mark and added two big upgrades to the campaign: An alternate Tavern-style game board on the back of the main board, and a Kickstarter-exclusive Vintas Royal Capstone. Read about them both in Update #17.\nQuestions? They might be answered in Update #18.\nTak is a new 2-player strategy game invented by James Ernest and Patrick Rothfuss. It was introduced in Patrick Rothfuss' book The Wise Man's Fear, Day 2 of the Kingkiller Chronicle. \nTak is a pure abstract game in the same family as chess, go, and mancala. Our goal was to design a new game with a sense of history; a beautiful game with simple rules and deep strategy. And we can't wait to share it with you!\nThis campaign has plenty of interesting pieces, and we aren't done adding more. This is a quick top-level list of all the items, with their add-on pricing. Below that is a quick list of the levels and what they contain.\nLevel Rewards at a Glance\nBacker Shadowstalker did us a favor, sharing a Google Doc that lets you figure out exactly what to pledge for any assortment of goodies. Once the pledge manager opens, you'll be able to add items to your pledge, or allocate extra money you've already pledged. \nThe Rewards: \nAll of these items are described in detail later on this page. The price is the cost to add the item to your pledge, but shipping is not included. That will be calculated in the Pledge Manager.\nCompanion Book: $15\nCompanion Book (E-Book): $5\nTavern Set (44 pcs): $25\nClassic Set (62 pcs, board, box, rules): $55\nCollector Coin: $5\nVintas Royal Capstone: $5\nCloth Board: $9\nArcanist's Board (Simple Wooden Board): $65\nCrazy Martin Piece Pack (44 pcs): $35\nTak Pairs Deck: $10\nDevi's Box (Deluxe set by Wyrmwood): $475\nDevi's Board (Lid from Devi's Box): $175\nThe Levels: \nAll pledge levels at $5 and above give you access to the Pledge Manager. Shortly after the campaign, we will invite you to the Pledge Manager, which will allow you to give us your shipping information, and to allocate any additional funds in your pledge.\nPATRON: $5. Access to Pledge Manager (only)\nSTUDENT: $15. Companion Book\nMERCENARY: $25. Tavern Set\nTROUPER: $40. Tavern Set and Companion Book\nMERCHANT: $55. Classic Set \nINNKEEPER: $65. Classic Set and Companion Book\nTINKER'S PACK: $90. Classic, Tavern, Book, and Coin\nARCANIST'S PACK: $155. Tinker's Pack plus Arcanist's Board\nGAELET'S PACK: $250. Tinker's Pack plus Devi's Board\nDEVI'S BOX: $475. Devi's Box, a handcrafted hardwood set, Book\nMONEYLENDER'S PACK: $550. Tinker's Pack plus Devi's Box\nNew at $1 Million: Higher value pledge levels starting with the Merchant also include one Vintas Royal Capstone (see Update 17).\nFor more about add-ons, please check out the refresher in Update #15.\nTak uses a square board, which can be any size from 3x3 up to 8x8, but the most common sizes are 5x5 and 6x6 (the \"Tavern\" and \"Classic\" games).\nEach player has several matching pieces, or \"stones,\" and one special piece called the \"Capstone.\" The Capstone can be any shape, and the other pieces should be simple, stackable pieces in a matching style.\nThe board starts empty, and the goal is to build a road (a connected string of your pieces) connecting opposite sides of the board.\nOn each turn, you will either place a piece in an empty space, or move a stack that you control. Stacks must move in a straight line, dropping pieces as they go, and possibly covering other pieces along the way.\nYou can play a piece upright. This piece is called a \"standing stone,\" or \"wall.\" It can't be part of a road, but other pieces can't stack on top of it. \nThe Capstone is your power piece. It can be part of a road, it can't be stacked on, and it can also flatten standing stones.\nYou can read the complete rules at our Tak information page. There's a short how to play video here. You can also watch Patrick and James discuss the development of the game (and watch them play it) in this video from Emerald City Comic Con. \nHere are more details on the pledge levels described in the right sidebar, and the items they contain. (Note: None of the designs for art, game pieces, or boards, are final.)\nPatron: If you'd just like to help out, you can contribute $5 at the Patron level. This level also grants you access to our pledge manager, where you can add individual items to your pledge. (Note: If you want the E-Book alone, which will have a retail price of $10, you can pledge at the $5 Patron level and add another $5 for the E-Book.)\nStudent: At the $15 level, you'll receive the hardcover Tak companion book, tentatively titled Tak: A Beautiful Game. This book will be written by James Ernest and Patrick Rothfuss and illustrated by Nate Taylor. Included in the book are game rules, strategy hints, a 5x5 game board on the back cover (designed by Pete Venters, see Update 16), a description of Tak's history in Temerant, and more.\nTak is an ancient and well-traveled game, with many variations and styles of play. The companion book will touch on the game's origins, and will explain the ancestry and meaning of various types of pieces. It will contain an expanded rules section describing regional game variations, as well as strategy hints and terms for various plays and combinations. \nMany of our stretch goals add more content to this book, including full rules for precursor games such as Kaen, specific rules and piece designs for various places in Temerant, and much more!\nMercenary: At the $25 level, you will receive the Tavern Set, a compact set of 44 wooden pieces, which is enough for a 5x5 game. The Tavern Set is designed for portability, and includes a drawstring bag. The Mercenary level will also include a one-page rules sheet, but no board.\nTrouper: At the $40 level, you will receive both the Tavern Set and companion book. Because the book contains the rules, and has a 5x5 board on the back, this level contains everything you need to play.\nThe Tavern Set is based on the Tak sets you'd find in a traveler's pack. The pieces are made of white birch, stained with a natural and walnut finish. They measure approximately 20mm square and 8mm thick, with 25mm turned wood capstones. It comes with a simple drawstring bag, with enough extra room for a few coins to pay your tab.  \nThe Tavern Set fits in a large pocket or small purse. If you back at the Mercenary level, which does not come with a board, it's easy to print or draw one. Or you can just play without a board, by marking the center space with a coin.\nMerchant: At the $55 level, you'll receive the Classic Set: 62 wooden pieces, a full-sized 6x6 game board, and the complete game rules.\nWe called this level the \"Merchant,\" in part, because this is exactly the version that will be offered to retail stores. \nMillion Dollar Update: Backers at this level and higher will also receive a Vintas Royal Capstone, which will not be available in stores, or anywhere else! See the Royal Capstone description below, and in Update 17.\nInnkeeper: At the $65 level, you'll receive the Classic Set and the companion book.\nThe Classic Set contains a mix of two common piece shapes: the \"Merchant\" set (trapezoids) and the \"Cane\" set (flat-bottomed circles.) You can read more about these shapes in Update #9.\nThe board in the Classic Set will be a 10\" square 6x6 \"hybrid\" game board, which is a unique design with diamonds and squares that can be used for any size game between 3x3 and 6x6. This board will be designed by illustrator Echo Chernik (See her early sketches in Update 16 and Update 17).\nMillion Dollar Update: The board will now have two sides: A florid Court-style board design on the front, and a rugged Tavern-style board on the back. Again, early information on this is in Update 17.\nThe board will be a single non-folding piece, an 80 pt tag (cardboard) with a full-color linen finish wrapper and art on both sides, illustrated by Echo Chernik. In other words, a very nice game board.\nTinker's Pack: At the $90 level, you'll receive everything described above: the Classic Set, the companion book, and the Tavern Set. We will also include a handsome Tak collector coin.\nAbout the Coin: Cheapass Games makes a new collector coin with each Kickstarter campaign. They are usually round, but this coin will be a 36 mm square (approx. 42\" on the diagonal). This coin is ideal as a centerpiece, allowing you to play Tak without a board!\nThe coin will be pierced in one corner, so you can add a jump ring and make it into a pendant or keychain. Like all our previous collector coins, this one will be made by our friends at Campaign Coins. You can add the collector coin to any pledge for $5.\nArcanist's Pack: At the $155 level, you will receive everything in the Tinker's Pack, plus the Arcanist's Board, a 10\" engraved wooden board. This board is a 6x6 hybrid design (diamonds and squares), made from cherry-veneered MDF. You can read more about the Arcanist's Board in Update #6.\nThe Arcanist's Board is also available as an add-on for $65.\nDevi's Board is the lid from Devi's Box (below). This is a deluxe double-sided Tak board, with a hybrid 6x6 design on one side, and a traditional 6x6 design on the other. Like Devi's Box, it is made by the folks at Wyrmwood, handcrafted from maple, walnut, and bloodwood. \nDevi's Board is available as part of the Gaelet's Pack, which also includes everything in the Tinker's Pack, for $250. This board can also be added to any pledge for $175.\nLike Devi's Box below, Devi's Board will be available only through this campaign, and will be a limited edition (though it will not be numbered). This is a board only, with no pieces or box.  \nDevi's Box is an heirloom-quality Tak set, handcrafted by our friends at Wyrmwood. Devi\u2019s Box is a complete game, including board, box, and pieces for a 6x6 game. The box and pieces are made from maple and walnut, with a touch of bloodwood. \nThe lid is a double-sided game board (also available by itself, see Devi's Board above), with a hybrid 6x6 game board on one side, and a traditional 6x6 board on the other. The pieces are maple and bloodwood, with turned capstones. You can find more details on Devi\u2019s Box in Update #12. There is also a short Devi's Box presentation video from Wyrmwood.\nThe Devi\u2019s Box pledge level includes Devi\u2019s Box and the Tak companion Book, for $475. You can also add Devi's box to any pledge level for the same price of $475.\nThe Moneylender\u2019s Pack pledge level includes Devi\u2019s Box, as well as everything in the Tinker\u2019s Pack: the Tavern Set, Classic Set, companion book, and coin, for $550.\nNotes: Devi\u2019s Box will be a numbered, limited edition, available only to Kickstarter backers. It will be available as an add-on for $475, but only while supplies last. We will set the production quantity once the pledge manager has been open for one month. \nOther Things: As you know, we have researched many interesting accessories for Tak during this campaign. Not all of them became reality, either because they didn't work out, or because they required additional research. The items we still want to pursue include a set of cast stone pieces, a handsome set of metal capstones, and alternate art boards by some of the finest artists in the business. \nEven though we didn't get to everything in this campaign, you can be sure that Tak will be popular for a long time to come, and we will have many chances to bring you new and amazing accessories for this beautiful game.\nBelow is a list of some additional items that are not part of any pledge level. If you'd like to add any of these items to your pledge, you can do so by increasing your pledge amount, or you can upgrade your pledge through our pledge manager after the campaign is over.\nFor more details on the workings of the pledge manager, please read Update #4.\nCloth Board: This is a simple 14\" bandanna, printed with a unique Tak board designed by Doctor Lucky himself, BJ Becker. Excellent for pairing with the Tavern Set or Crazy Martin. This board was introduced in Update #14 and you can add it to your pledge for $9.\nThe Crazy Martin Piece Pack: This item was introduced in Update #4. It's a set of 44 pieces (21 pieces and one capstone per side) matching the pieces in the Classic Set. That's enough for a 5x5 game by itself, but it's also enough to upgrade the 6x6 Classic Set into a game as large as 8x8. (Of course, you'll have to find an 8x8 board. This should not be hard) You can add the Crazy Martin Piece Pack for $35.\nTak Pairs Deck: If you like Pairs, and you like Tak, here's a fun crossover game. Pairs is a pub game with a bunch of variations and lots of different theme decks. It was Cheapass Games' first collaboration with Patrick Rothfuss. You can add this Pairs deck for $10. \nThe deck will be drawn by Nate Taylor, and the artwork above should be considered extremely placeholder.\nVintas Royal Capstone: At the $1 million mark, we introduced this Kickstarter-exclusive Capstone, which we will now include free in the Merchant pledge level and higher. You can also add it to any pledge (Patron and higher) for $5.\nThe Vintas Royal Capstone will be similar to the prototype shown above, turned from white birch but stained in a medium natural wood color, possibly cherry (final color TBD). It is a single piece (not a set of two) and it will be available only to backers of this campaign. Show your opponents that you were here at the beginning! You can read more about it in Update 17.\nE-Book: You can add an electronic copy of the companion book to your pledge for $5. This e-book will eventually sell for $10, so if you want the e-book alone, you can pledge $5 for the Patron level, and add the extra $5 to get the e-book.\nNote that none of these add-on prices include shipping, because that cost will depend on where you are located, and what else is in your order. If we need to collect additional shipping, we can do it through the pledge manager. For more about shipping and the pledge manager, check out Update #4.\nWe have made several improvements to this campaign, listed below. Some of them are Stretch Goals, while others are just improvements that we unlocked when we figured out how to do them. As a group we're calling them \"Campaign Goals.\" As you know, we still have many great items in the works!\nUpgrade 1: Turned wood capstones in the Tavern Set. These were originally planned as simple cubes, but at 1200 sets it was worth the extra bump to add a more traditional turned capstone to the Tavern Set. Not really a stretch goal, but an upgrade for day 2.\nStretch Goal 1: Rules for Kaen, a Tak precursor game in the companion book. Kaen is an ancient gambling game that uses many of the same pieces from Tak. This is a new game by James Ernest and Patrick Rothfuss, unlocked at 2500 backers.\nNew Item 1: The Crazy Martin Piece Pack. This is like a jumbo-sized Tavern Set, a 44-piece kit matching the pieces in the Classic Set, which is enough for a 5x5 game itself, or up to an 8x8 game with the pieces in the Classic Set. Unlocked at the $310k miliestone. \nNew Item 2: E-Book version of the Companion Book: It seemed reasonable to offer the companion book in an electronic format, so on 4/22 we introduced it as an add-on for $5. \nNew Item 3: The Arcanist's Board. This solid wood board was introduced on 4/25, as the cornerstone of the Arcanist's Pack, and as a separate add-on. Read about it in Update #6.\nNew Item 4: Tak Pairs Deck. A crossover that makes more sense than a Pairs-themed Tak board (don't tempt us), this new Pairs deck by Nate Taylor is described in Update #7. Added at 4500 backers.\nUpgrade 2: We've hired Echo Chernik to design the game board! Echo is an insanely talented illustrator and we are thrilled to have her designing the board in the Classic Set.\nStretch Goal 2: Tak and the Edema Ruh. A section in the companion Book with alternate rules and piece types for the Ruh. Unlocked at 3 Achievement Points.\nStretch Goal 3: Tak in Tarbean: Customs and gambling rules from this bustling city. Unlocked at 6 Achievement Points.\nStretch Goal 4: Tak at the University. Variant piece designs, alternate rules, and a different set of gambling rules for the University players. Unlocked at 10 Achievement Points. \nNew Items 5 and 6: Devi's Board and Devi's Box: Introduced during Week 3, these deluxe Tak items are created by the craftsmen at Wyrmwood. \nStretch Goal 5: Tak at the Eolian. This special stretch goal brings us a new traditional Tak song, created by Molly Lewis.\nNew Item 7: Cloth Board. A simple 14\" bandanna printed with a unique organic Tak board, introduced on May 12 as a $9 add-on.\nStretch Goal 6: Tak in Fae. Piece designs and board artwork among the Faen.\nStretch Goal 7: Tak Puzzles: A few fun tak puzzles for the companion book, created by Ira Fay.\nStretch Goal 8: Tak in Alveron's Court: More details about the games between Bredon and Kvothe.\nStretch Goal 9: Rules for Locke, another precursor game to Tak. This one isn't much like Tak at all... but we love to make games! \nStretch Goals 10 and 11: At $1M, we unlocked the twin goals of a second board design in the Classic Set, and a Kickstarter-only \"Royal Vintas Capstone.\" Read about both in Update 17. \nStretch Goal 12: Tak in Adem. Rules and variants in Ademre, with sketches of Adem Tak boards and pieces. Unlocked at 23 Achievement Points.\nStretch Goal 13: The Board of Seven. We hoped to unlock this at 10k backers, but problems with the original plan means we can only promise it as a future product. See the details in Update 18.\nStretch Goal 14: Pat's Original Tak Rules. Before it was a real game, Pat took a stab at making Tak. These rules will be part of the companion book, unlocked at 24 points. Details in Update 18.\nStretch Goal 15: Plans for Bredon's Capstones. This is just a sketch, not a real thing yet, but we thought we'd give you a glimpse at the designs for Bredon's Capstones. Details in Update 18.\nWe Did It! In Update #8, we introduced a block of achievement-based stretch goals, such as posting photos of your home-made Tak set, or giving us a follow on Twitter. We unlocked the last of these goals with only a few hours to go. Here's the whole board!\nWe Did It!\nAchievements Unlocked:\n0 Points (Unlocked): Unlock rules for Kaen (described in Update #2) Just a freebie to get us started.\n3 Points (Unlocked): Tak and the Edema Ruh. A section in the companion book describing Ruh-specific piece designs, traditions, and board artwork. \n6 Points (Unlocked): Tak in Tarbean. What do Tarbean\u2019s impoverished but resourceful denizens use for Tak pieces? What are the knock-down, drag-out gambling rules?\n10 Points (Unlocked): Tak at the University. Variant piece designs, alternate rules, and a different set of gambling rules for the University players.\n12 Points (Unlocked): Tak at the Eolian: The Ballad of Tak, a traditional story of a traveler's strange method of play, created by the incomparable Molly Lewis!\n14 Points (Unlocked): Tak in Fae.

A sketch of Bredon's Capstones, designed by Nate Taylor. \nDetails on the last three unlocks are in Update 18.\nSpecial kudos to Mira Chaplin, who unlocked of our first secret Achievement, \"Play Tak on the Great Wall of China.\"  \nOur other secret achievement goes to Steph Kelly, who sent us an adorable photo of tortoises playing Tak. \nWant to learn more?

I\u2019ve only had Tak on my table for a few days, but it\u2019s already become a bit of an obsession.\" \u2014Dave Banks, GeekDad\n\"Tak somehow lives up to its fictional origin as a timeless, ancient game of effortless elegance and deep strategy. It\u2019s instantly engaging and only becomes more engrossing as you begin to grasp its depths.\" \u2014Tom Harrison, Gaming Trend\n\"Tak is one of those abstract games that manages a lot of challenging play in a very uncomplicated package.\" \u2014David Miller, Purple Pawn\n\"This is an artistic representation of what Rothfuss had in mind when he imagined Tak in his novel, and if you're a fan of the series, I can't imagine a better piece of memorabilia to own.\" \u2014Mick Joest, GameTyrant\n\"I\u2019ll admit it. I\u2019m in love with the idea of a game like Tak being \u201cour\u201d game. A game that everyone at GenCon knows and plays. A game that is always nearby because everyone has a travel set of pieces in their bag or jacket. It\u2019s that idea that got me to look at Tak, but it\u2019s the simple-yet-cutthroat gameplay that keeps me logged into playtak and has me eager to acquire a physical set.\" \u2014Rafael Cordero, Ding and Dent\n\"Tak evolves as the players take their turns. A single move can have enough impact to be felt for several rounds. And yet, a player is not fully aware of how their move influences the game until later. Again, the game evolves, opens, and changes organically, responding to each new piece in surprising ways.\" \u2014Cyrus Kirby, Father Geek", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nCheapass Games has created and fulfilled eight Kickstarter campaigns to date, so as a general rule we know what we are doing. However, we are working with new suppliers on Tak because of the many unusual types of components this campaign requires. So, there is always a risk that one of these suppliers will be late or even prove to be unacceptable.\n\nFor the most part, the components in the core products are well-understood and we have decent bids from all those suppliers.

The Evolution base game is so vivid and true-to-life that it was recently featured in the world's leading scientific journal, Nature.\nIn Evolution: Climate, players adapt their species in a dynamic ecosystem where food is scarce, predators lurk, and the climate can swing between scorching hot and icy cold. Traits like a Hard Shell and Horns can protect your species from Carnivores while a Long Neck will help them get food that others cannot reach. Heavy Fur and Migratory can protect your species from the cold while being Nocturnal or Burrowing will provide protection from the cruel desert sun. With over 200,000 ways to evolve your species, every game evolves into a different adventure.\nIf you don't own Evolution, then buy the stand-alone Evolution: CLIMATE ($55 pledge level). It contains everything you need to play Evolution: CLIMATE.  \nIf you already own Evolution, then buy the Evolution: CLIMATE conversion kit ($25 pledge level).  It contains everything you need to transform the base game into Evolution: CLIMATE.\nBelow are links to 3rd-party reviews of Climate prototypes. Some details may be different in the final game. \nGeekDad: \"I can\u2019t say enough how impressed I\u2019ve been with the Evolution game series, and I highly recommend taking a look at Climate.\" Full Review\nSpaceBiff: \"Not only are you competing with other species, but against the land itself. There are new methods for survival, a fresh crop of ways to die, and even more reasons to play it over and over, observing as different combinations of interdependent species, fearsome carnivores, and the climate itself conspire to prevent you from thriving. This is Evolution at its toughest and most rewarding.\" Full Review\nFatherGeek: \"The Climate track introduces a lot more strategy and tactics. I have to think more about what I will add to the Watering Hole, what Trait cards to use, and what situations I need to prepare for.\" Full Review\nClimate features original watercolors by world-renowned nature artist Catherine Hamilton. Catherine taught as a professor at Rhode Island School of Design between 1997 and 2003. She was featured in the 2012 HBO documentary \"Birders: the Central Park Effect\" and has developed a body of work that crosses the boundaries between artistic and scientific investigation.\nNocturnal Critters!\nEpic Volcanoes!\nGiant Beasts!\nDefensive Horns!\nScorching Deserts!\nTerrifying Carnivores!\nFAT TISSUE!!!\nRaging Wildfires!\nWe'll post more art from the game as the campaign progresses. Catherine Hamilton is hard at work at this very moment creating wonderfully beautiful watercolors to help bring this game to life. What's this? It's the middle of the night you say? It doesn't matter! Catherine Hamilton does not sleep.\nEvolution: CLIMATE stand-alone comes with everything you need to play the game. It comes with 48 new CLIMATE trait cards and a modified version of the 129 trait cards from the Evolution base set.  \nTechnical Note for those who care: It is possible (although a little cluncky) to play the Evolution base game using the components from the Climate stand-alone.  Read Update #4 for details.\nThe Evolution: CLIMATE conversion kit comes with everything you need to convert your base set of Evolution into Evolution: CLIMATE.  \n1) Remove Ambush, Burrowing, Defensive Herding, and Carnivore from the trait cards in your base set of Evolution.  \n2) Shuffle the 86 cards from the conversion kit into the remaining base set cards.\n3) Use the Climate Track instead of the Watering Hole. \n This video shows how to play the base game of Evolution: \nEvolution: CLIMATE builds upon the rules of the Evolution base set. The centerpiece of Evolution: CLIMATE is the Climate Track, a 21\" x 9\" Watering Hole that keeps track of the climate and features a dramatic watercolor vista by Catherine Hamilton. Here's a prototype of the Climate Track made from her rough draft concept sketch:\nCLIMATE TRACK PROTOTYPE - Not final art!\nThe climate moves between scorching hot where large animals die from the heat and icy cold where small animals die from the cold. This system is intended to mirror the actual effects of ambient temperature on animals.  Here is a link to the \"surface area-volume ratio effect\" science that is being modeled. Food is abundant when the climate is warm and scarce when it is scorching hot or freezing.\nEvery new trait introduced in CLIMATE helps prevent population loss from the heat or the cold. Species will need these new traits to adapt to extreme climate conditions. In the base set Evolution, species had to adapt to food scarcity and predators. Now there is an additional threat to survival: Mother Nature!   \nAdapting to a Changing Ecosystem!\nThe heart of the Evolution game system is adapting to a continually changing ecosystem. There is no best strategy or best card combination in Evolution: Climate.  \nVideo Overview\nThe  only video overview we have of Climate was done by a German. This will help you understand the new additions that Climate brings to the base Evolution game.\n  Stretch goals marked Kickstarter Exclusive below will be available in limited quantities at northstargames.com after the campaign is over and rewards have shipped. \nAmong them, you'll see Oversized Scenario Cards. These are 70x120mm cards, illustrated by the fabulous artist Anna Kryczkowska, each of which changes a fundamental aspect of the game.\nTo use them, players pick a scenario card before the game begins and the rule described on it will apply through the entire game. Example: the Cretaceous Period card specifies each species can have an unlimited number of traits. \nFor all levels that involve shipment of physical games, backers are limited to 3 total copies per pledge (all copies should be the same game; no mixing pledge levels). To add games beyond the first, manually enter the $ total when making your pledge or click the blue \"Manage\" button next to a previously made pledge. \nAll pledges must be complete by March 22nd at 11:59 pm EST. We don't use a pledge manager\u2014you may not increase your pledge or add-on items at KS prices after the campaign ends.\nOnly backers who pledge at the $25 or $55 levels may add-on. To add any of the items below to your pledge, manually enter the $ listed below when making your pledge or click the blue \"Manage\" button next to a previously made pledge.\nYou are limited to ONE of each add-on. \nThe shipping fees listed below are automatically added to your pledge at checkout. Shipping is EU friendly and won't incur VAT/import duties, nor for US, Canada, and Australia. You may incur duties in other countries, but only if there's more than one game in your order. \nWe subsidize shipping for every backer, so the shipping cost for each backer is $10 cheaper than it would otherwise be. \nNote: after the campaign is over, we'll send you a survey to get your shipping information. Backers who haven't filled theirs out by May 20 will be charged an extra $15 shipping, because shipping late individual rewards is much more expensive than the bulk shipping we do for those who fill out their surveys on time. \nWe're running an awesome promotion for Evolution 2nd Edition and the Climate Conversion Kit through our U.S. and Canadian distributors during this campaign.

We have top notch employees and customer service.\n\nThis is our third Kickstarter campaign associated with the Evolution product line, and by now we have a clear idea of the pain points for a campaign of this type.\n\nFor example, one mistake we made in the last campaign was to use several distributors to ship to different regions around the world. This made fulfillment complicated and made it hard for us to monitor shipments. As a result too many boxes arrived to backers damaged, or failed to arrive at all. \n\nNow, instead, we're using a single fulfillment house which specializes in shipping rewards worldwide, one recommended by Jamie Stegmaier, whose campaigns are the gold standard in this area. This allows us to get games to you more reliably and more cheaply, and that backers automatically get tracking numbers. \n\nAs ever, unforeseen manufacturing problems can arise. The chances are low because the components for the expansion will be made by the same manufacturer that makes the base game, the Evolution: Flight expansion, and with whom we have a productive relationship. If a manufacturing problem should arise, we have lots of experience working through manufacturing issues, and can bring it to bear.\n\nFinally, whatever problems may arise, we will continue our policy of replacing any components with which our backers aren't satisfied.

Howard\u2019s Conan: Adventures in an Age Undreamed Of is a 368 page full colour hardcover book containing everything you\u2019ll need to adventure in the world of Robert E. Howard\u2019s hero, Conan. It is based entirely on the canonical Conan stories, and uses the 2D20 system developed by Modiphius and used in Mutant Chronicles 3rd Edition, Infinity, John Carter Warlord of Mars and other fine games. This tome presents character generation, the game\u2019s rules, and a wealth of source material, including cultures, geography, religions, magic, gods, monsters, gamemastering advice, adventure seeds, and much more. This work has been developed by an all-star writing team, with close involvement by respected Robert E. Howard authorities, and is illustrated by world-renowned Conan artists. \nAll the supplements will also be in beautiful full colour hardback and describe the world in additional detail, presenting different styles of play from the phases of Conan\u2019s saga... Thief, Barbarian, Mercenary, Pirate, the Unknown East, Brigand, Kingdoms of the South, Scout... and King. Other books will explore sorcery, monsters and demons, nameless cults, secret societies and fighting orders, distant lands, ancient ruins, and lost cities. The game line will be supported with a wide range of ready-to-play adventures and campaigns spanning the breadth of Conan\u2019s world.\nThe 2d20 system is a dynamic, narrative system, designed to produce varied and interesting results from dramatic and action-packed situations. Characters roll two d20s, attempting to roll as low as possible on each one \u2013 the more dice that roll low, the more successes the character scores.You can download the Quickstart complete with introductory rules, adventure and pre-generated characters from DriveThruRPG \nWatch Conan being played playtested last year in Robert E Howard's very own house by Jeffrey Shanks, Mark Finn and other illustrious guests! \nThis video is an excerpt from: A Riddle of Steel: The Definitive History of Conan the Barbarian - FauxPop Media\u2019s deep dive into the past, present and future of Robert E. Howard\u2019s legendary adventurer king. Check in with their Facebook page for ongoing updates.\nIn 1932 Robert E. Howard created CONAN, the greatest character in pulp adventure, changing fantasy fiction forever. The first Conan story was \u201cThe Phoenix on the Sword\u201d, and in it he leapt to savage life. Many stories followed quickly after, mere glimpses into a saga like no other hero had lived. Barbarian and thief, pirate and brigand, mercenary and scout... Conan was all of these things.

Patrice was Editor of the definitive, three-volume Conan series (from Del Rey Books (US), Wandering Star (UK) and Bragelonne (France). Awarded Lifetime Achievement award from the Howard Foundation (USA, 2014) and the Special Award from the Imaginales (France, 2012).\nModiphius is a family owned games publisher run by Chris & Rita Birch based in London that has produced 4 successful Kickstarters Achtung! Cthulhu, Mutant Chronicles, Thunderbirds Co-Operative Boardgame and Infinity. We also publish (or co-publish) the award winning Mutant: Year Zero, Dust Adventures, Mindjammer, Symbaroum and Fragged Empire.

Writers, artists, editors, rules designers, layout artists, proof readers, logistics, finance, warehouses, and more. People often have problems - it's just part of life and this can cause delays. When this happens we do the best we can to help - moving workload to someone else, finding a replacement, getting more people involved, or moving things around in the schedule to allow them more time. Modiphius is a family owned company (Chris & Rita) and we know that most people working on games like this do it for the love, not the salaries so we work hard to make it as supportive an environment as possible. \n\nThere are always issues to deal with no matter how well you prepare - perhaps a supplier's moulds break and need several weeks to replace, perhaps a printer gets flooded destroying some stock they just spent a month printing, deliveries can go missing, data can be collected in such a way that it causes problems with fulfilment, and so on. \n\nWe have run 4 major Kickstarter's now so are familiar with a lot of the possible problems and do our best to prepare. Modiphius has expanded adding two people who help analyse data and plan logistics with the various companies we use to ship out our rewards across the world. We've learnt from our mistakes and taken steps to simplify how we run Kickstarters at every step possible. \n\nEven so we allow more time 'just in case' and we work hard to ensure everyone queries are answered in a timely manner. Modiphius has one of the best reputations for customer service. When things do go wrong we are open and transparent. We try to find a fair solution for everyone. \n\nYou can check out out previous Kickstarters for Achtung! Cthulhu, Mutant Chronicles 3rd Edition Roleplaying Game and Thunderbirds Co-Operative Boardgame to see how happy people are with their rewards. We have completed shipping 12 books and lots of merchandising for Achtung! Cthulhu. Mutant Chronicles has had over 70% of shipments across 7 books with lots of accessories and a further 20% of pledges with 7 books have started shipping this month. The first shipment of Thunderbirds pledges shipped only 2 weeks late and the final shipment will be despatched the middle of next month. \n\nWith each of these projects we have a different team of writers, artists, editors and layout designers so one project's schedules (or delays) doesn't affect another. We also have many other games we have published (or co-published) including the award winning Mutant: Year Zero, Dust Adventures, Mindjammer, Fragged Empire and Symbaroum. \n\nConan has some particular issues we are bearing in mind: \n\n- All products will need to be approved by Conan Properties LLC. We have a great relationship with them though, and they have loved everything we have done so far so I don't foresee any problems here. With Jeff Shanks involvement we are effectively ensuring everything we produce for Conan is about as true to the spirit of Robert E. Howard as possible. \n\n- We're using major name artists for each of the main books in the line. They can have demanding schedules and if they are delayed delivering a book cover to us by a previous project over-running then that could affect the timetable. We do have a number of covers we're commissioning that could work for several different books, so in the event one cover is delayed we can likely substitute another cover in it's place by an equally amazing artist.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #151", "update_userinfo": "More Previews, and Age of Conan Dev Starts!", "update_content": "Hi everyone,\nWe\u2019re back with some more previews, as well as some exciting news about upcoming developments!\nPreview: Shining Kingdoms"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #150", "update_userinfo": "PREVIEWS: The Isle of the Eons and Waves Stained Crimson", "update_content": "Brave wanderers,\nAs you continue your quest through the strange and distant lands beyond the Hyborian kingdoms, your party finds itself faced with a coastline which gives way to violent raging seas.

It has around 20 million combinations. We'll wait!\nAfter a few weeks of playing with the Random Comic Generator, we started to wonder if its hundreds of random panels might lend themselves to a card game, where you compete against your friends to finish a comic with a funny punchline.

It worked really, really well (with a few tweaks).\nAnd now we think our game, Joking Hazard, is ready to bring to the world. With your help, of course.\nThe game itself includes a deck of 370 unique panel cards (we did the math, and that\u2019s over 50 million combinations of comics) most of which are so messed up we can\u2019t show them on Kickstarter without censoring them.

And upon your boss card, you will keep track of your posse and your influence.\nYou'll be sending your posse members around town to play poker, gain influence, and purchase buildings.\nEach location offers compelling options of where to place your posse members. Like using a building there, gaining instant influence, or doubling down for extra influence at the risk of not getting any.  \nYou will play a poker hand at EACH location you send a posse member to.\nWinning will get you the \"poker pot\" and any extra influence from a \"double down\" spot. You will need this influence for acquiring buildings later on in the round.\nThe Sheriff's Office is a unique location offering players the ability to change the value or suit of their poker card. It also offers a way to acquire an extra building each round and even activate your 3rd posse member! \nBEWARE! If you're standing in the way of your opponent, they can send their posse member in for a duel and possibly take your spot!\nFighting doesn't go unnoticed around here, or unrewarded for that matter, it is the wild west after all. The winner of the last duel always takes the wanted card.\nAfter the locations have been resolved, and players have gained influence for their winning poker hands, a buying phase occurs. Players can now use their influence to acquire one building from a location where they have a posse member. Remember, hitting up the Sheriff's Office can get you an extra buy during this phase; that can be a real game changer!\nBuildings offer you victory points, access to their abilities, and industry influence. \nAt the end of each round, the player who had the best poker hand at the Town Hall advances one of three industries forward in their rank.\nAt the end of six rounds,or as many bullets as a revolver can hold, the game is over. The industries have now been ranked 1st through 3rd and the majority share holders (players with the most industry influence) will be paid bonus victory points respectively. Players add that to the sum of their victory points gained from acquired buildings, with the wanted player gaining an extra 2, and the player who has the most victory points is the winner!  \nClick to enlarge! *this stretch goal does not increase the card count of base or deluxe.\n                                             Upgrades the Premium Print 'N Play and will also be made public on BGG for all TEG players.

The games will be delivered right to your door.

We want to make the Spellbook that\u2019s just perfect for you, so we\u2019ve tried to create the right options that let you select your level of customization. If you're looking for something pre-configured (and, quite frankly, awesome) scroll down to read about the Acquisitions Inc Employee Manual, Volume I, our Spellbook designed for fans of Penny Arcade's adventuring franchise.\nLeather - To start, choose your binding leather, which comes in onyx, chocolate, sandstone, black cherry, dark amber, and winter wheat. Keep an eye on our stretch goals; if we hit our marks, even more leather options will become available.\n(L->R) Dark amber, black cherry, onyx, sandstone, chocolate, winter wheat\nArt - Next, you\u2019ll want to decide how to adorn your Spellbook. Each reward offers one of four options: blank canvas (the \"unadorned\" look), signature (any one of our existing pieces), personalized (signature plus your choice of text), and fully customized (any image you send us that we can create). Then, choose what color ink you\u2019d like us to use; right now we\u2019re offering silver, gold, bronze, ochre, and navy.\nIf we aren't able to offer an option that feels right to you, there are two choices. Arch-Mage lets you work directly with Quentin to design your very own custom art that we'll emblazon on your Spellbook for you. Or, if you're into DIY, you can also opt for the blank canvas; we'll be releasing a tutorial later with tips on our favorite techniques for decorating the leather covers.\n <3 Pfenix Artwork! Thanks for adding to the options! Check out more on Facebook and Deviant Art ^_^\nExample of a signature art in practice\nWood - You\u2019ll want to choose the wood base for your Spellbook. Check out the reward descriptions for what woods are available to you. Dan favors the walnut base because it has a powerful darkness and the swirling grain adds an air of ancient mystery. Quentin likes the maple best because it glides under his fingers and has a book-like feel to it. Whichever you choose, you can\u2019t go wrong. Choose an accompanying wooden trim to line the reflecting pool and interior of the Spellbook. Trim options include cherry, walnut, and purpleheart, redheart, mahogany, and maple for all backing levels.\nBase woods for Conjurer, Warlock, and higher reward levels\nBase woods for Sorcerer and higher reward levels\nBase woods for Royal Wizard and higher reward levels\nTrim for all levels!\nInterior design - Your Spellbook is nearly complete! You\u2019ll have to tell us what you want to use your Spellbook for. If you need one for trading card games, the card deck style is designed to hold 80 single sleeved cards (100 single sleeved card variant available - see Add Ons). If you prefer the rolling tray style, the full interior measures approximately 5 x 7 inches. Every open style Spellbook comes with one of several options for foam lining. We offer several stock layouts, but we\u2019d like to hear from you about how you\u2019d cut your foam. If we don\u2019t offer the perfect shape, we offer partially perforated foam blanks which you can customize to perfection.\nHere are some examples of foam inserts we will offer. We will add more here near the end of the campaign based on what you all tell us.\nFinalized foam options\n(Extra foam inserts are a $2 add on each)\nFelt lining - Rolling tray-style (or open-style) Spellbooks will come with a felt lining on the bottom with your choice of 3 colors.

Your objective is simple: destroy all other Mechs on the battlefield before they destroy you. Strategic Mech construction and tactical use of the HEX-based terrain are needed to achieve victory.\nOne copy of Mech Deck can accommodate 2-4 players. However, because of its modular design, the battlefield can expand to accommodate even more Mechs, allowing for bigger battles and teamplay. A typical starting board is shown below.\nThe various terrain tiles you see have unique effects on the battlefield. For instance, hiding behind a Forest tile provides a defensive bonus against enemies firing through it. Standing on top of a Hill provides a bonus to enemies you fire down upon.\n  Players also have access to Deck cards throughout the game. Using these can help shift the tides of battle in your favor. Deck cards can provide bonuses dice rolls, help mitigate incoming damage, or deploy small helper units onto the battlefield. \nThe win condition is simple: be the last surviving Mech on the battlefield!\n One copy of Mech Deck comes with the components listed below. Please note that this image is a prototype of the game, and the final product is likely to be different (and better) from what you see.\nPlayers begin the game with a draft to construct their Mechs, one part at a time. The completed Mechs are then deployed on a randomly-generated battlefield. A Mech is made up of five plastic parts that fit together to form each player's piece in the game.\nDeck cards provide even more strategic options. You can use a delayed Orbital Strike to control your opponents and force them to avoid certain tiles, for example. Or you might drop a Smoke Grenade to cover your escape as you put some distance between you and your opponent.\nMech Deck was designed from the ground up with synergy in mind, which means you'll have the opportunity to discover a number of fun and destructive combos through the use of parts and Deck cards. For instance, you can use the Blitz Grabber to pull an opponent directly in front of you, and then use the Blazing Sword to unleash a flurry of melee attacks against him.\nCheck out a gameplay video!\nClick here to download a draft of the rulebook for a more detailed peek into how the game works.\n \"One of the coolest things I saw at PAX East\"\n-Jerry Holkins of Penny arcade at the Unpub booth at PAX East 2015\nMech Deck got a great write up by Austin Walker from the Giantbomb Beastcast after playing it at the Indie Megabooth at PAX Prime 2015.\nhttp://www.giantbomb.com/articles/some-pax-prime-2015-impressions/1100-5264/\nMech Deck was mentioned on the GiantBomb podcast!

The physical commitment to selecting each part and building your own Mech is a huge aspect of the Mech Deck experience. Many have suggested cardboard standies or tokens to represent the mechs as a method to cut costs, however those options would compromise this core idea.\nThe parts are assembled from five separate pieces of plastic, which means the connections need to fit snugly together while resisting breakage. However, this design means the manufacturing process needs to be of higher quality and precision than your typical plastic miniature, which means they cost more to make. The higher quality parts also requires a higher minimum order quantity \u2013 thousands instead of hundreds \u2013 in order to justify the manufacturing costs.\nThe core rules of Mech Deck are firmly established at this point, having gone through numerous playtests and revisions in the past two years. \nWatch this to see a blind playtest session that was held at the Game Maker's Guild in Boston, MA. \nThe game's rules are complete, and we are now in the process of tweaking numbers to ensure the game is perfectly balanced upon release.\nMechs: This prototype generation of Mech parts is tried and true, but we're working on improving their visual appeal even further. The method of fastening has proven reliable, so at this point we are adding an additional level of detail to help bring the pieces more in-line with the standards you see in today's miniature market.\nArt: Illustration is underway for all the pilots, terrain, and artwork for the game.\n Graphic design: Card and token designs are established. The Player Mat is just about done, with a few small changes to be made. The rulebook text is a few more rounds of edits away from being complete, at which point we will begin to work on its final presentation.\nMech cards\n Deck Cards\n Player mat\nMech Deck will be ready to ship sometime in 2017. A few months after the campaign has been funded, the final polish will be put on all of the design and components, and we will begin manufacturing. Dealing with overseas manufacturing can have unforeseen hiccups, so we are projecting a shipping date a bit further down the line to ensure backers' expectations are met.\nRealistically, we expect Mech Deck will be ready to ship in the next 12 to 18 months. We gave ourselves 24 months to ensure the game meets our quality standards and so that we don't have to apologize for breaking a promise to our backers down the line.\nZone 1: USA - $10    \nZone 2: Canada, UK, Germany, France - $12.95 \nZone 3: Ireland, Denmark, Austria, Belgium, Greece, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Israel, Finland, and Sweden - $19.95 \n  Zone 4: Australia, Poland, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Croatia, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Bulgaria, China, Hong Kong, Thailand, Japan, South Korea, Myanmar, Singapore, Philippines, New Zealand, Norway, Mexico, Switzerland, Taiwan - $26.95\nZone 5: Rest of the World - $35.95\n\nAfter two years spent on development and promotion, it seems as though Mech Deck is as popular as it will get outside of the spotlight of Kickstarter. All that is left at this point is art and polish: playtesting is largely complete, and the game is ready to be presented to potential backers.\n Mech Deck was first dreamt up more than five years ago. The first prototypes consisted of scribbles on paper and Mechs built out of Lego. In the three years that followed, 3D printing became much more widely available and accessible, making the creation of a prototype possible.   \nIn the last two years, Mech Deck has been shown at GenCon, Origins, PAX East, PAX Prime, The Boston Festival of Indie games, and a number of smaller local conventions and gatherings. It has been heavily playtested by groups like the Game Makers Guild of Boston, as well.\nThe people working on Mech Deck are a mix of professionals and newcomers to the board game industry.\nPatrick Fahy is the game's creator, is also a professional in the CAD for manufacturing world with over six years experience.\nVincent Attonito is in charge of marketing and business, has worked in sales and marketing for companies like Sony and Apple for the past five years.\nEli Badra is in charge of press and editing, ensuring our language is as clear as possible in all facets of Mech Deck. He is a piano teacher/player by profession, as well as a part-time copyeditor, when the opportunity arises.\nPeter Wocken is the graphic designer. He has worked in the board game industry for over six years, and his past employers include: Fantasy Flight Games, Plaid Hat Games, Floodgate Games, Crash Games, and a bunch of other companies that include \u201cGame(s)\u201d in the title. He's worked on more than 30 published games, including a bunch that he can\u2019t talk about yet.\nToni Bell is the artist. \"I have been a longtime fan and creator of fantastical art, and I concentrate on character design! In December 2013, I graduated from the College for Creative Studies with a concentration in Illustration. Since then, I've been working professionally, and my current major projects include Mech Deck and a fantasy RPG project in the works.\"", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nComing into the game design industry from the outside will be a challenge. Thanks to the help of people from Boardgame Geek, Indie Game Design Forum, Facebook design groups, and local indie game dev meetup groups like the Game Maker\u2019s Guild, I have learned a lot about how making a board game should be done. I am fully aware, however, that you can never be prepared for everything, especially when large scale plastics manufacturing is concerned.\n\nWith these concerns in mind, Mech Deck will be vetted by manufacturing professionals in the board game industry, and will use only the highest quality plastics for the modular pieces. Durability and precision are our highest priority.\n\nMech Deck is my dream project, and I have invested a considerable amount of time and money making it a reality. Anyone you ask will say how devoted I have been to making this the best possible version of the game I envisioned over 5 years ago, and now I want your help to take the most important step toward fully realizing Mech Deck as I see it in my head.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Patrick Fahy\nFirst created \u00b7 69 backed\nProduct designer with over 6 years of professional experience.See more"}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #5", "update_userinfo": "The final hours", "update_content": "I want to thank you all for the support given to this game.

The amount of theory, scales, and influences floating around in your head can be overwhelming. Sometimes, it feels impossible to know where to begin.\nAs a musician, I know what it's like. And when I reflected on my own experiences and talked to other musicians, I realized that I wasn't alone.\nImprovisation is the most natural way to make music. Deep down, we are all improvisers. All creative people are.\nBut somehow, we forgot. And the result is that for many people, making music has become a source of fear and anxiety, rather than of joy and freedom.\nI created Tonic because I think improvisation is something that all musicians can learn. Tonic helps open your mind and frees you of the need to sound \"good.\" It has the power to change the way you connect to your instrument and make you a better musician today.\nIt\u2019s for all musicians -- classical, jazz, rock, professional, beginner, young, or old. You can play it alone or with a group, and you don't need any experience.\nEach card has an instruction that challenges you to create a short piece of music on the spot. Roll the dice to choose the pitches that you can use. \nTo play, shuffle the cards and follow the directions.\nThere is no score, and there are no losers. The point is to have fun and make music. Your success is measured by how free and fearless you feel when working through the exercises.\nRules\nRelax.\nThere are no wrong notes.\nAlways listen.\nDon't try to sound \"good.\" This is a judgement-free zone.\nHave an open mind.\nKeep it simple.\nWhen in doubt, be bold.\nIf you're new to improvisation: Tonic is a safe and effective starting point. No stress, no complicated theory, no high expectations.\n\nIf you're an experienced musician: Tonic will guide you out of your comfort zone and stretch your mind in new ways.\n INCLUDES:\nHigh quality poker-style cards on heavy card stock\nA sturdy and slim carrying box\nThree 12-sided black musical dice\nInstructions with definitions of musical terms\nSome cards tell you what pitches to use. Others have time constraints. Some are for specific instruments. A few are visual. Some tell you to use your computer or phone. Some are meditative, and some are chaotic. Some are straightforward, and some are...a little odd.\nThe main idea is this: When we are forced to act under certain guidelines, we rise to the challenge. Restriction breeds innovation.\n\nMost cards ask you to select pitches, which you can do by rolling the dice. Tonic comes with a set of three 12-sided dice, with each side featuring one of the 12 notes of the chromatic scale.\n\nPrototype.\n\nYou can also use the dice for your regular practice routines or compositions. Try using them to pick keys for drills, or to come up with unexpected harmonies or melodic lines. \n\nThey're great any time you want to introduce an element of randomness into your playing.\n\nBecome the musician you've always wanted to be.\nLearn to create music from nothing. Start composing and improvising today in a low-stress and accessible way. Play music the way you\u2019ve always wanted to-- without anxiety or fear.\nBreak through creative blocks. Free yourself of the written page and tap deep into your subconscious to realize your full potential as an artist and performer.\nCure performance anxiety. Practice making music with no safety net, and you will learn to trust yourself and develop confidence in your art. Tonic will help destroy stage fright in all its ugly forms.\nTrain your ears. Without written notes to guide you, you\u2019ll learn to truly listen. Maybe for the first time in your musical life. Tonic will develop your ear and help you translate the ideas in your head through your instrument.\nPlay Alone or with a Group\nMost cards can be played along, with a partner, or a larger group.\n\nClassical musicians:\nHistorically, classical musicians were improvisers, but it's a lost art. Tonic is an easy entry point because it removes the variables and tells you exactly what to do.\nBuild the confidence to play without written music and learn skills that will transfer to your classical studies.\nJazz players: \nThe problem with jazz education is that there is TOO MUCH information out there. Every book and every teacher has a different approach to improv and a new set of exercises for you to learn. \nTake a step back and approach music like a child again. Learn to forget about changes, tunes, and theory, and just play from a natural and confident place.  \nTeachers: \nShare with your students to encourage collaboration and critical thinking skills. \nTonic is what I wish my teachers had when I was a student. It's a playful introduction to music for kids and grown-ups alike that also improves problem-solving and confidence.\nRock, blues, pop, and metal musicians: \nWorks your idea muscle and will help spark fresh ideas for songwriting and solos.\nPush out of your comfort zone and towards exploring new sounds and ways to think about your instrument. \nNon-musicians and beginners: \nDoes not require any knowledge of music theory to play. All you need is basic knowledge of musical terms, which are explained in the instructions.\nChallenge yourself to see what you're capable of, relying only on the expressive potential of your own mind.\nThe musician in your life (as a gift):\nGreat gift item for all musicians. Best for high school age and older.\nAn open-ended practice tool that musicians are free to use in their own way.\nI believe so strongly in Tonic that I\u2019ve made the cards available completely for free. You can download them as a PDF and print them out yourself.\n\nIt's taken me years of research and study to bring Tonic to you today. With the help of communities like Reddit (thanks r/musictheory!) and a devoted Twitter following, thousands of musicians and educators have already been influenced by Tonic. \n\nBut now it's time to bring it to a larger audience.\n\nTo make Tonic commercially viable, I need to meet certain minimum order requirements with my manufacturer. This will cost thousands of dollars - a big risk unless I'm sure that the concept behind Tonic is something people want.\n\nI need your help to make Tonic a reality. With your support, I can put the first edition of Tonic into production and share it with the world.\n\nTonic is more than just a card game. By supporting Tonic, you are showing the world that your believe in a different way to make music. Not only are you getting a cool new toy, but you\u2019re also showing that you believe in the creative power of improvisation, and in making a difficult and intimidating concept more accessible to everyone.\n\nThis game is just the beginning -- Tonic will ultimately form the foundation of a much larger community of improvisers that will continue to grow and learn together long after the campaign is over.\nThanks for your support everyone! Now that we met our goal, these versions expand on some of the ideas in the original game. All use cards and dice like the original. \n\nThese will become available ONLY if the campaign raises $13k. You will be able to choose your option in a survey after the campaign is over. If you pledge to get multiple versions, you will be able to mix-and-match versions.\n\nUses cards similar to the doodles and graphs in the original Tonic. Inspired by the unconventional notation of composers like Iannis Xenakis, Anthony Braxton, and John Cage.\n Example:\nTheory-intensive games based on common and not-so-common harmonic, melodic, and structural concepts. For advanced musicians.\nExample: \n\"Create a melody that fits the following chord progression: I - iv - V7 - I. Repeat until you run out of ideas.\"\n  Games which help you take a simple theme and twist it around to form something new.\nExample:\n  You will receive your reward by late September (US) or mid-October (International).\nFor many of you, this is the first Kickstarter project you've backed. Here's a rundown of the process.\n\nKickstarter isn't a store. Think of it as a way to pre-order something that isn't for sale yet. It helps independent inventors and creators like me get their projects off the ground. \n\nFor $25, you get a copy of the first edition of Tonic. If you pledge a higher amount, you can choose to get extra sets for your students or friends.\n\nWhen you make a pledge, your payment information is recorded but not charged. You will only get billed at the end of the campaign.\n\nYou can change or cancel your pledge any time during the campaign.\n\nBy backing Tonic, you're helping to create a new approach to improvisation, and making the world a better place for all musicians.\n\nKeep coming back for updates, or follow on Twitter: @tonicimprov\n\n\"Absolutely love the message of the game . . .

And I can tell you right now - it's beautiful.\nBEHOLD!\nThe chest portion will be embroidered, and the clocktalk on the sleeve and lower back will be screen printed, black-on-black.\nClose up of embroidery\nSo a couple of things to note:\n1. Everyone has been asking me what hoodie \"type\" this will be made of, and I was told it would be the same as the Thanks Obama hoodie we sell on the store. Well, the designers decided to upgrade it to a more expensive type, but unfortunately we lose the thumbholes. So if you were dead set on the thumbholes, we understand if you have to change your pledge BUT...\n2. ... The upgrades to this hoodie are now have an athletic, water resistant, tight weave to it (water beads on it, rather than soaks it up). Although it is obviously a very cool and useful feature, the reason for it was more aesthetic - the sheen to the material was decided to be more thematically appropriate for Automata, and it really made the black-on-black design pop. For sizes 4x and above, it'll be the same design but with a slightly different hoodie blank (same color).\n3. If you have not purchased the hoodie yet, you still can via our add-on offer ($70 per hoodie for domestic, $75 for international). If you'd like to take advantage of the add-on offer, go to this page and click \"Manage\" on the right side. Add $70/75 per hoodie to that amount, and then when we send out the surveys, we'll ask you how many of the ADD-ON Hoodie you wanted. (Yes, you can add on as many hoodies and add-on pins as you'd like - we will sort it out at the survey process)\nAnd as with all the stuff here, this hoodie will NEVER be made or sold again outside of this kickstarter campaign.\nThank you everyone! We've got 6 days to go!!\n----\n7/28/2015: 2 Weeks Left! ANOTHER PIN DESIGN!\nWait, what do you mean another pin design? You only have one pin available on this campaign, right?  \nThat was true... UNTIL NOW!  \nWe're offering a Second, Completely Different and Unique pin design for those pledging at the PIN DESIGN tier or higher as an optional ADD-ON. If you'd like this new design, add $25 per Add-On pin (regardless if you are shipping internationally or domestically).  \nThis pin is DUAL LAYER, so the broken Carl mask will sit on top of the base level. This pin will NEVER be made or sold again, so not only is it exclusive for the next two weeks, but the quantity made will be limited to that actually ordered for this Kickstarter Campaign. The quantity made will be stamped on the back of the pin.  \nSo if you'd like to take advantage of the add-on offer, go to this page and click on \"Manage\" on the right side. You can change the amount at the top without changing the reward. So, for instance, you are currently at the $150 tier, there's a little box with your pledge amount in it (it says \"It's up to you. Any amount of $1 or more.\" to the right of it). Add $25 to that amount, and then when we send out the surveys, we'll ask you how many of the ADD-ON Pin you wanted.  \nAlso! If you added on the Hoodie already, you can stack that as well! No worries, we'll get it all sorted in the Post-Campaign Survey stage!  \nTwo weeks left and 10k to go! We should be able to close this out soon, and then it's stretchgoal territory! Thank you everyone!\n----\n7/22/2015: HOODIE ADD ON UPDATE!\nWe've been getting tons of emails and messages asking us to open up more hoodies... so the best way to do this without messing with the rarity of the pins is to offer it to you as an add-on at ANY LEVEL. What this means is if you want a hoodie (or an additional hoodie), INCREASE your pledge level by $70 for U.S. addresses and by $75 for International addresses, and we'll make sure you get the exclusive hoodie. (do it again if you want additional) When it comes time to issue out our surveys, we'll ask you if you pledged for an additional hoodie and what size you asked for etc.\nClick on \"Manage\" on the right side, you can change the amount at the top without changing the reward. So, for instance, you are currently at the $55 tier. There's a little box with $55 in it (it says \"It's up to you. Any amount of $1 or more.\" to the right of it) - you can change it there.\n----\nSix years ago, we released this comic.\nPage 1 to the original Automata series.\nSince then, it's spawned two additional mini-series (Blood & Oil and Silverside), a dedicated base of fans, and even interest from Hollywood. The goal from the beginning - with any of our side projects - is to find someone who loved it enough and could dedicate the time necessary to fully flesh out the Automata universe. That happened pretty quick: before we knew it, we were in talks with a number of different movie studios. To us, it became not a matter of if, but when, we'd be able to buy a ticket and watch a very, very large Carl and Detective Regal brooding on a movie screen.\nBut after spending four years trying to do things the \"Hollywood Way,\" we've learned one thing: It's really really hard to get a movie made. The negotiations, the moving parts, the politics\u2026 Even when we had a property optioned - another project called The New Kid - it's not really a guarantee that anything will ever happen. The words \"Period Piece\" and \"Sci Fi\" together in close proximity give that town the hives. We found ourselves right back where we started. \nBut, maybe that isn't such a bad thing. \nWe went back to the drawing board, and with the help of friend and filmmaker Van Alan, we laid out the most pragmatic plan for what it would take to make an Automata series ourselves. Locations visited, scripts written, test footage shot - after two years of work from Van and his team, it started to seem like something we might actually be able to pull off.\nMaking a live action mini-series is expensive, and maybe not a very good \"investment\" in the classic sense. An actual movie studio would have a \"portfolio\" of films where one or two hits covers the losses for the rest of their lineup. Well, THIS IS THE ONLY ONE WE HAVE. And it doesn't have to make money - it just has to pay for itself. Its only responsibilities are:\n1. Get made, and  \n2. Be cool \n ... We'll handle the second one, if you can handle the first. Sound good? \nTELL ME MORE\nTest Footage Wireframes\nThe series will tell an original Automata story over five webisodes, each episode roughly 10-12 minutes long. Van has been working closely with Tycho/Jerry Holkins (that's, um, me) on the script. I don't really want to spoil it in, like, the Kickstarter pitch, but...  \nRead at your own intense risk for spoilification:\nSam & Carl are hired by a wealthy businessman to spy on his wife. When she winds up dead, and an automaton goes missing, Sam & Carl find themselves wound up in an intricate plot of sex, intrigue, and deception. It will be rad. The end.\nLighting for Test Footage\nIf the project funds successfully, Van and his crew are going to get started on this IMMEDIATELY. They will begin casting the key roles, building sets, working on the VFX, etc. They're raring to go.\nThey'll \"shoot\" (movie term) before the end of the year, and those that back via the digital download reward will get to view it in the Summer of 2016, 3 months ahead of the worldwide release.\nTell me about Van and his crew!\nVAN ALAN : Van is a Seattle-based filmmaker originally from Houston, TX. He has directed numerous music videos for bands such as The Presidents of the United States of America, Better Than Ezra, and Copeland. He has written and directed four short films and has been selected as a participant in the Texas Filmmakers Showcase in 2009 and 2010. In 2010, Van moved to Seattle to work with Penny Arcade to produce and direct their reality web-series and became the go-to guy to capture PAX conventions and other video projects.\nWILL LUMMUS : Will is an independent film producer originally from Nacogdoches, TX. In 2009, he moved to Seattle and became integrated into the Seattle Independent Film Community, working as a production and location assistant and eventually location coordinating and producing. His recent production credits include films such as Touchy Feely, Laggies, You Can\u2019t Win, Captain Fantastic, and Ridley Scott\u2019s The Man In The High Castle.\nLACEY LEAVITT : Lacey is a Seattle-based producer. She has produced and co-produced many of the best Seattle indie films of the last five years including Colin Trevorrow's Safety Not Guaranteed (Aubrey Plaza, Mark Duplass, Jake Johnson), Lynn Shelton's Laggies (Keira Knightley, Sam Rockwell, Chloe Grace Moretz) Megan Griffiths' Lucky Them (Toni Collette, Thomas Haden Church, Johnny Depp), and Todd Rohal's The Catechism Cataclysm (Steve Little, Robert Longstreet). She's a Sundance Creative Producing Lab alum and also co-directed the roller derby documentary Blood on the Flat Track.\nCompositing for Test Footage\nThat's a really... interesting... funding goal.\nWe think so, too. After running two decent sized Kickstarter projects, we now know more about the tiny details of running them. We've seen how expensive rewards get, we've backed projects that failed, and we wondered if there wasn't a clearer way to handle it.\nIf you're interested in the nuts and bolts, business guy Robert Khoo put together this summary.\nYou\u2019ve probably noticed that the goal for this project is a weird number. $322,637.09 is an oddly specific figure, some might say. Well, let\u2019s break down that number to make sure you, as a backer, know what your money is actually going toward. \nLet\u2019s first start with this: $251,842.46. That\u2019s the ACTUAL cost of producing the series. The breakdown of this budget, put together by Van, are as follows. \nAutomata Webseries Production Budget\nYou may have heard that Van was able to secure funding from the State of Washington which reduced the budget by $46,000. So we can go ahead and deduct that amount right off the top from $251,842.46, which leaves us with $205,842.46 that we need to raise from backers via Kickstarter. \nBut wait! $205,842.46 doesn\u2019t match up with $322,637.09 we\u2019re asking for. Where did that extra money go? Well, two things. \n1. Based on our previous Kickstarter projects, we now know our average Reward Cost Rate is 27.7%. That means for every dollar you kick in, it actually costs us (on average) 27.7 cents to produce and fulfill the reward you asked for. This includes design, production, warehouse labor, and even the box and tape that is necessary to ship the thing. \n2. The Kickstarter Fee is 5%. The average processing fee is 3.5%. \nSince we know it\u2019ll cost us 27.7 cents for every dollar we raise AND we need to pay Kickstarter and CC companies their fees, we need to raise more than $205,842.46. In fact, after accounting for Rewards and Fees, you can see where we reach our actual goal of $322,637.09. \nThis makes more sense if we do it in reverse: \n$322,637.09 is what we\u2019re asking for. \nKickstarter and credit card fees knock off 8.5%. That leaves us with $295,212.94 \nTo fulfill the rewards of $322,637.09, it\u2019ll cost us 27.7% of that. That breaks down to $89,370.47. $295,212.94 less $89,370.47 is... <drum roll> $205,842.46. \nPLEDGE LEVELS!\nFull level descriptions found on right side of page!\nStretch Goals!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI would say the biggest risk we will run into are with budget overruns and unforeseen delays in productions.

To do this, I have adjust my shipping discounts from previous projects. Shipping is a volatile cost that I cannot undermine. I simply cannot commit to shipping methods or discounts that would price me out of fulfilling my responsibility to you. Thank you for your patience and understanding regarding this.\nShipping Costs\nEvery backer is important to me, regardless of location, there are just certain realities in shipping costs that we all have to face. To offset this, while remaining fiscally responsible, I have included a small discount for ALL shipping, but no shipping is free.\nRegarding customs: because this game comes in a tiny box with a low declaration, most international backers, of 1 and 2 copies, will not get hit with customs or import fees. We have shipped thousands and thousands of copies of Tiny Epic games to international backers and I've only heard of a couple of incidents where a backer (of 1 and/or 2 copies) was hit with any sort of fees.   \n\"Tiny Epic\" is a series of games designed by Scott Almes and published by Gamelyn Games. Each game in this series must strictly adhere to TWO core values: Tiny and Epic! Tiny meaning small (pocket-sized) box with simple and easy to understand rules. Epic meaning gratifying gameplay with lots of strategy and replay-ability. Over the course of numerous games, the series will explore many unique genres and themes. \nCurrently the line features a 4X/Civ game Tiny Epic Kingdoms, a cooperative Tower Defense game Tiny Epic Defenders and a intergalactic dice driven/engine building game Tiny Epic Galaxies.\nThe \"Tiny Epic\" series began January of 2013 on Kickstarter with its flagship game Tiny Epic Kingdoms! Which has sold a collective total of over 20,000 copies.\nClick to visit the Tiny Epic Kingdoms Kickstarter page.\nClick here to learn more about Tiny Epic Kingdoms\nThe second game in the series is a thematic sequel to Tiny Epic Kingdoms called Tiny Epic Defenders.\nClick to visit the Tiny Epic Defenders Kickstarter page.\nClick here to learn more about Tiny Epic Defenders\nTiny Epic Galaxies, the third installment in the series. \nClick to visit the Tiny Epic Galaxies Kickstarter page.\nClick here to learn more about Tiny Epic Galaxies.\nGamers can expect to see more Tiny Epic games in the near future! Stay tuned by joining the Gamelyn Games Newsletter. \nAll Add-Ons for this project are included in the reward tiers and/or will be handled AFTER the project within PledgeManager. There are no separate Add-Ons during the project.  \nIf you'd like to add additional copies, or other menu items, to your pledge beyond what is available in the reward tiers, you may do so within PledgeManager. \nDo not add to your KS pledge for add-ons, you will pay for them in PledgeManager.\nCheck out our exciting PledgeManager menu below:\nPledgeManager is a post-project service used to collect backer's shipping data and to provide additional product options.

It is prone to many opportunities for mistakes and that does not exclude experienced publishers.\n\nWe're proud to say that we are prepared for the task at hand and have years of experience in successfully fulfilling board game projects from Kickstarter.\n\nHere are the steps we are taking to prepare and reduce the likelihood of mistakes and delays:\n\n1. We have done significant pre-production. This includes having all the art for the game completed and the graphic art over 75% completed. The production quote is in hand and ready to be initiated.\n\n2. We are proud to be working with Panda Game Manufacturing again, the same manufacturer we have used to create Dungeon Heroes, Fantasy Frontier, the Fantasy Gaming Figures, the GIANT Meeples, Tiny Epic Kingdoms, Tiny Epic Defenders, and Tiny Epic Galaxies. We have a great relationship with their entire team. We are familiar with their production requirements, timelines, payment schedules, communication methods and Chinese freight arrangements. Together we have created some great games and products and we hope that Tiny Epic Kingdoms Heroes' Call and Tiny Epic Kingdoms 2nd Edition will be our next!\n\n3. Professional fulfillment is already in place, and we are proud to say it will be handled by Ship Naked. They were responsible for having fulfilled the shipments of Rise!, Dungeon Heroes, Fantasy Frontier, Tiny Epic Kingdoms, Tiny Epic Defenders and, the soon to be shipped, Tiny Epic Galaxies. All were delivered on schedule with professionalism and reliability. Ship Naked has proven to be communicative, punctual and customer service minded when dealing with Gamelyn Games' customers.\n\nAgain, this isn't to say that this project won't experience mistakes, they happen to everyone but it does show that this road is familiar to all parties involved.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAbove all, I am 100% dedicated to backer communication. I will be transparent with our process, as to involve our backers as much as possible.\n\nI will be present daily during the project to answer any questions or read any comments and I will provide regular updates and supply photos of the progress when possible.\n\nThank you for your trust in us! Lets bring Tiny Epic Kingdoms Heroes' Call and Tiny Epic Kingdoms 2nd Edition to the gaming world!\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPREVIOUS PROJECTS' STATUS: \nTiny Epic Galaxies is currently in production and within 1 month of its estimated delivery date.\n\nTiny Epic Defenders, Tiny Epic Kingdoms, Fantasy Frontier, Dungeon Heroes, the Fantasy Gaming Figures and the Mini GIANT Meeple Project have all completed fulfillment successfully.

Players adapt their species in a dynamic ecosystem where food is scarce and predators lurk. Traits like Hard Shell and Horns protect your species from Carnivores, while a Long Neck help them reach food others can't. Flight (MSRP $30) is the first expansion to Evolution which you can preorder for $25.\nComponents: 1 watering hole board, 180 food tokens, 24 species boards, 48 wooden cubes (not pictured), 129 trait cards, 6 bags, 1 rulebook, 6 player aids, and 1 giant start player dino-meeple. \nComponents: 12 avian species boards, 12 flight trait cards made of cardboard, 34 trait cards, 14 event cards, 1 rules, and 1 cliff board.\nEvolution is the first board game to mimic how evolution actually works, not as a proactive progression along a technology tree, but as a flux with ebbs and flows to which players must continually adapt. Each species' success depends on how its traits interact with the changing environment, but no trait is unconditionally better than the others.  It was originally designed by a Russian biologist to demonstrate scientific principles and later developed by prominent game designers as a labor of love.\nEvolution and the Flight expansion features original watercolors by Catherine Hamilton.  Catherine graduated from the Department of Illustration at the Rhode Island School of Design (RISD) in 1991 and taught as a RISD professor between 1997 and 2003.  She was featured in the 2012 HBO documentary \"Birders: the Central Park Effect\" and has developed a body of work that crosses the boundaries between artistic and scientific investigation.  \nThe first edition of Evolution was a finalist for the Escapist's 2014 Board Game of the Year and three-time Golden Geek nominee. This Kickstarter campaign improves the system with two major releases:  \nEvolution (Second Edition) - Three changes were made to the cards for the 2nd edition. The food numbers were lowered to improve the game experience for first time players, several cards were changed to make them more thematic and to increase the amount of card synergies, and Catherine Hamilton was commissioned to paint additional backgrounds for 9 of the 17 cards cards.  \nEvolution: Flight Expansion - this expansion enriches your experience by giving you the ability to create avian species. Flight gives your creatures enormous advantages, like the ability to evade non-flying predators and soar to a new location when food is scarce. But it also has a cost: avian creatures have to eat an enormous amount of food to maintain those advantages!  \nFIRST STRETCH GOAL UPDATE: Anyone who purchases the Flight expansion will now get a full set of the 2nd Edition cards! If you have the 1st edition of Evolution, just back Flight and you will receive the updated cards and rules for FREE!\nEvolution 2nd Edition Base Game\nThe best way to learn the game is to watch this how-to-play video from the incomparable Rodney Smith at Watch it Played:\nFor the 2nd Edition, we haven't changed the core mechanics, but we have made other changes, of three different kinds: better art, adjusted card functions for the benefit of tournament players, and an adjustment to the food system to give new players a better experience. You can read the complete, detailed list of changes here.\nThe Flight Expansion\nWith this expansion, you may now choose between creating a normal species and creating a flying species. See the complete rules here. Flying species have special costs and advantages:\nCosts\nYou must discard 2 cards instead of 1 to create a flying species.\nFlying species have a maximum body size of 3 instead of 6.\nAvian species have an upkeep cost of food equal to their Body Size. The upkeep cost simulates the amount of food needed to maintain wings.\nAdvantages\nSome of the new expansion traits, like Dive-Bomb and Brood Parasite, only work for flying creatures. \nA species with Flight may take food from the Cliff, giving it an extra source of food. \nA species with Flight cannot be attacked unless the attacking Carnivore also has the Flight trait. \nIf a species with Flight also has the Carnivore trait, you may discard from your hand to negate Symbiosis, Warning Call, or Climbing for when it attacks.\nThe expansion doesn't change the base game's core mechanics, so it's a snap to learn, even while it changes strategies and tactics dramatically!  \nRahdo's final thoughts:\nJeremy Salinas (Drakkenstrike) - \"Evolution is a spectacularly designed and developed game, one that is both incredibly simple, yet intricately complex when played with experienced gamers. The game's ability to constantly change directions with just a simple introduction of different animal \"traits\" to ones species is fantastic, creating a really dynamic game of cat and mouse between its players. The balance of Population, Body Size, and Hand/Resource Management is so incredibly well polished and woven into it's theme that it still amazes me at just how much complexity this game generates with just a handful of 20 or so unique Trait Cards and nothing else. \nIncredible game, one that does more than most games could imagine with far fewer moving parts.\" (see full comments) \nJeff Cannata (Founder of the Totally Rad Show) - \"This game was fantastic. There's so many things at play and so many different viable strategies, we just had a blast with this game.\" (See podcast review - starts at 1:29)\nJoel Eddy (Drive Thru Reviews) - \"It feels very organic and natural and it's definitely an improvement on the original...it feels like an ecoystem evolving, and the components are just out of this world.\" (see video review)\nJon Gets Games - I've enjoyed it every time I've played. The theme integration with the mechanics creates a very compelling package. (see video review)\nFlaming Dice Reviews - It doesn't get much better than Evolution if you really want a unique gaming experience with really different components. I've never played anything quite like Evolution. (see video review)\nThese stretch goals include up to 7 sets of promo cards that can be exchanged on a 1 to 1 basis for cards in the base set.  Do not add these cards without removing cards from the base set!  If you do, the Carnivore ratio will be skewed and the length of the game will be changed.  All of the art on these promo cards were done artist John Ariosa (Mice & Mystics, Summoner Wars, etc).  And special thanks to the Kickstarter backers who came up with 3 of the card ideas!\n$50k - Anyone who backs the Flight expansion at $25 will get a complete set (129 cards) of 2nd edition Evolution trait cards and a 2nd edition Rules booklet.  Note: Anyone who backs 2nd edition Evolution or 2nd edition Evolution and Flight will already have these components inside their Evolution game.\n$100k - A set of 7 promo cards called \"Last Stand\" which turns the hunter into the hunted!  \n$150k - A swanky Food Bag with an awesome bird graphic on it and a set of 7 promo cards called \"Quills\" created by Kickstarter backer \"Randy Dykstra\".\n$175k - A set of 7 promo cards called \"Pounce\" which turns the hunted into the more horribly hunted!\n$200k - A set of 7 promo cards called \"Sharp Teeth\" created by Kickstarter backer \"Jeremy Kaemmer\", a giant Bird Meeple start player token, and a special limited edition box cover for your game(s) instead of the normal retail box cover. These limited edition art covers (shown above) do not have the North Star Games branding logo at the bottom of box.\n $225k - A set of 7 promo cards called \"Invasive Species\" which turns one of your species into a serious environmental hazard for a round.\n $250k -  A set of 7 promo cards called \"Pest\" created by Kickstarter backer \"Murray MacPherson\", plus another set of 7 promo cards called \"Rapid Mutation\" which allows one of your species to take a chance with fate!

The company has two blockbusters that have broken out into the mass market: Wits & Wagers and Say Anything. Wits & Wagers has won more awards than any other party game in history (though Dominic swears that Say Anything is more fun). Their goal with the Evolution game system is to help set the stage for a new genre of adaptation themed board games and to be a defining game in that genre.\nThe Designers\nEvolution was originally designed by a Russian biologist named Dmitry Knorre to demonstrate scientific principles to his students. Sergey Machin refined the game and released it in Russia as Evolution: Origin of the Species. Dominic Crapuchettes brought the concept to North Star Games and redesigned it with the enthusiastic help of everyone in the North Star Games offices.  \nDominic Crapuchettes (he's the one with glasses)\nDmitry Knorre (he's the one with the beard)\nSergey Machin (with glasses and a beard)\nThe Artists\nCatherine Hamilton is a world-renowned nature artist who is creating all of the card artwork for Evolution. She's a graduate of the prestigious Rhode Island School of Design (1991), and has worked as both Adjunct Faculty and Guest Critic at the same institution. \nCatherine Hamilton (glasses but no beard - thank god!)\nJacoby O'Connor is one of the graphic designers for Evolution.  He has worked with North Star Games on many project including Wits & Wagers and Say Anything.\nJacoby O'Connor (big beard and cool shades)", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nNorth Star Games has been publishing board games for over 10 years. We know what it takes to produce high quality board games in large quantities. We have top notch employees and customer service.\n\nHaving Kickstarted the Evolution base game last year, we know much better how avoid trouble and navigate the complexities of the platform than we did the first time around. We've made this campaign simpler, with fewer pledge levels and stretch goals. Fewer options means we can better ensure we're executing perfectly on the stuff we really want to do well. \n\nAs ever, unforeseen manufacturing problems can arise. The chances are low because the components for the expansion will be made by the same manufacturer that makes the base game and with whom we already have a productive relationship. However, if a manufacturing problem should arise, this isn't our first time at the rodeo: we have lots of experience working through manufacturing issues, and can bring all of that experience to bear.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #35", "update_userinfo": "Oceans, the next Evolution game, is now live on Kickstarter", "update_content": "With thousands of play-tests, years of non-stop design, over 100 unique illustrations, and more content than we've ever packed into a game, Oceans is now live on Kickstarter.

No problem! Here\u2019s a quick intro with everything you need to know. \n2-5 players, 15-35 minutes to play, ages 8 and up. \nEasy to learn, fast-paced, and fun for all ages! \nPush-your-luck game with elements of strategy. \nThe position and the direction dice face when they land matters! \nRoll dice on every players\u2019 turn- it\u2019s not just a multiplayer game of solitaire! \nEverything fits in an adorably cool, small and portable ninja plush case, so you can take Ninja Dice on the go! \nNinja Dice is proud to be a product originally backed on Kickstarter. Many thanks to all our loyal fans who made this game possible! \nWant to learn more about the original Ninja Dice game? Visit our website at www.greenbriergames.com/NinjaDice. Follow us on Facebook and Twitter!\nOr check out a review by Tom Vasel:\n and this just in! \nBower's Game Corner: review of Kage Masters (prototype copy)\nIn Ninja Dice: Kage Masters, you can play Ninja Dice as one of 5 new unique characters known as kage masters! A kage (pronounced \u201cCOG-AY\u201d, not \u201ccage\u201d!) is an elite ninja, the leader of his or her village, and master of the clan\u2019s hidden techniques. Each kage has their own kage die and character card, complete with special abilities unique to that kage. The kage dice are a seamless addition to the original game rules, yet they add many layers of engaging fun to the gameplay!\nBut that\u2019s not all- get ready for some new location cards! Like the originals, these special location cards add extra challenge and flavor to the base game, but now they offer a bonus reward for beating them: extra elite training! Read on to find more about what kinds of new abilities the kage masters bring to Ninja Dice.\nAt the beginning of the game, you choose which kage you want to play as, taking their character card and kage die. Every time you would normally roll, roll your kage die as well. That means when it\u2019s your turn, roll it with the skill dice. On other players\u2019 turns, roll it as a special threat die. Your character card describes what abilities you have, including what happens when you roll your kage die\u2019s unique icons. Depending on whether or not it\u2019s your turn, your kage\u2019s abilities can change, so each turn is different and engaging!\nThere are 5 kage to choose from, each with their own different abilities and strategies for playing the game. There\u2019s one for every kind of player!\n  Exclusive Masters:\nHere\u2019s an overview of what you\u2019ll get in the Ninja Dice: Kage Masters expansion:\n5 new kage dice, each with a custom design and colored icons \n5 kage character cards, sized to fit within the original ninja dice box \n12 all-new location cards (plus 6 unlocked cards for a total of 18)\n1 rules sheet \nFire and Posion tokens (added with Stretch Goal #2)\nAll of this enhances the original Ninja Dice game (sold separately). You can even fit the new dice in the original dice bag of the base game! But keep checking back, we\u2019re ready to include more if we have enough backers! See the stretch goals section below for additional details\nWhat does exclusive mean? Items marked as exclusive will only be available via this Kickstrater or from Greenbrier Games directly. You will not find these in retail. These are also limited items that will only have a small initial print run and may not be printed again.\nWith 5 successful Kickstarters under our belt, we have learned a lot about what it takes to get our games into your hands. One of the biggest things is how variable shipping can be. As such, we will be charging shipping after the Kickstarter concludes, according to the actual costs incurred to ship to your area. We will do this through our own Pledge Manager system after the campaign concludes.\nThere are two reasons we are doing this. First, it allows us to provide a lower rate on the actual pledge levels and structure a much tighter budget for the campaign and stretch goals since we do not have to estimate for shipping costs. Second, the funds raised for the project are 100% for the actual project itself rather than being partially inflated by shipping costs that may not be accurate.\nWe will be shipping through our various distribution areas. Depending on where you live, we will ship to you through our USA, Europe, Canada, or Australian centers. \nThough the pricing may vary due to any add-ons you pledge for by the end of the campaign, we're anticipating an average shipping fee to be about: \n$5 to ship in the USA\n$5-10 in Canada\n$8-12 in the EU and Australia / New Zealand\n$15-20 to ship everywhere else\nPlease note these are estimates and they may increase or decrease based on the quantity of stretch goals we unlock, final box size and weight and also the current postal prices at the time of shipping.\nMoney-Back Guarantee: If you decide you don\u2019t like Ninja Dice Kage Masters within 1 month of receiving it, you can return it for a refund (see FAQ for details). \nEarly-Adopter Discount: Every copy of Ninja Dice Kage Masters ($10) comes at more than a 20% discount off planned MSRP ($12.99) as an appreciation of your early support. \nLimited and Exclusive Content: We'll only print a limited number of certain rewards based on the final pledge totals. Some rewards will only be available for purchase through this Kickstarter or at conventions. This is your chance to get them at a discount while they last! \nWe Listen: We treat backers as collaborators\u2014we really value your input, and we promptly and transparently address all questions and concerns. Have an idea for a cool stretch goal or an awesome mechanic that would be perfect for the game? Tell us and it might get added! \nBecause We Need You: We\u2019ve covered the cost of graphic design and game design for Ninja Dice Kage Masters, but we can\u2019t manufacture and ship the game without your support. You, the backers, are the people who make our games possible.\nWe are all lifelong gamers in one form or another who have been leading dual lives. By day working normal jobs, by night (and on weekends) building games whether physical or digital. In our spare time, we have formed a successful board game development and publishing company. We are so excited to be returning to Ninja Dice with this expansion!\nFind out More\nhttp://www.greenbriergames.com/main/index.php/project/heavy-steam/ \nhttps://www.facebook.com/Greenbriergames\nhttps://twitter.com/GreenBrierGames", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our sixth tabletop game Kickstarter project. Our first project started with cardboard and ended up with custom miniatures, cards, dice and expansion packs. From our past projects we've learned the ins and outs of nearly every facet of the board game manufacturing world. We've learned (painfully!) how to set realistic goals for both ourselves and our backers, hopefully making the process rewarding for everyone involved.\n\nAs with any project produced overseas, there can be unforeseen production delays, shipping delays, and customs delays. So we've learned (again painfully!) all about delays and ways to manage or avoid them. We know that some delays can\u2019t be predicted or avoided, so we plan extra room in our schedule. This way we can give you the best estimate for the day we can get our game into your hands- because we want to ship our games as much as you want to receive them!\n\nThe dice and initial game mechanics have been completed. We just need to finish card art and put in the final touches- plus any new additions for the awesome stretch goals we might unlock! Of course, we've also learned to be realistic in the extra time needed for any extra content that may be added with our stretch goals. Any extra time we spend will be devoted to putting on the polish to make our game the best product it can be!\n\nSo, though there are potential delays in a manufacturing project like Ninja Dice, we are confident, with the experience from our last five successful projects and our close relationship with our manufacturer, that we will meet (or beat) our projected delivery date.\n\nThank you so much for your help making our dreams a reality!\n~ The Greenbrier Games Team\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #22", "update_userinfo": "Our Kickstarter for Helios Expanse is live!", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #21", "update_userinfo": "Happy New Year!", "update_content": "We\u2019ve been extremely busy over here at GBG during the holiday season packaging Kage Masters... feeling much like Santa's elves.

Here are some fun social media avatars you can use to help with that:\nAll rewards for this project will be shipped from the US.\nDelivering Your Reward\nMy number one goal, and responsibility, is to deliver the rewards that you pledge for. I'm proud to say that I have achieved this with every project that I have run, but not without learning from mistakes. \nI was burned on unexpected increases to shipping costs with Tiny Epic Defenders, and quickly learned that I have to be more responsible in accounting for that risk.\nTo do this, I must adjust my shipping discounts. Shipping is a volatile cost that I cannot undermine. I simply cannot commit to shipping methods or discounts that would price me out of fulfilling my responsibility and promise to you. Thank you for your patience and understanding.\nShipping Costs\nEvery backer is important to me, regardless of location, there are just certain realities in shipping costs that we all have to face. To offset this, while remaining fiscally responsible, I have included a small discount for ALL shipping, but US shipping is not free. Shipping discounts, as well as game discounts, get even deeper at higher quantity packs, making 6 and 10 packs great group pledges!\nRegarding customs; because this game comes in a tiny box with a low declaration, most international backers, of 1 or 2 copies, should not get hit with customs or import fees. We shipped thousands of copies of Tiny Epic Kingdoms to international backers and I've only heard of a couple of incidents where a backer (of 1 or 2 copies) was hit with any sort of fees.\nAlso please keep this in mind; the base game will retail with a $25 MSRP. So international backers who get the base game ($16 for the game + $12 for international shipping) are only paying $3 more than a future gamer who picks the game up off the shelf in the US! AND, if you are getting the deluxe version, you're getting an even better deal! The total cost (not including effort) to acquire and \"assemble\" a deluxe copy after the Kickstarter will be at least $35 BEFORE shipping.

This is assuming that the BGG store picks up the deluxe content, which they have not committed to at this time. \n\"Tiny Epic\" is a series of games designed by Scott Almes and published by Gamelyn Games. Each game in this series must strictly adhere to TWO core values: Tiny and Epic! Tiny meaning small (pocket-sized) box with simple and easy to understand rules. Epic meaning gratifying gameplay with lots of strategy and replay-ability. Over the course of numerous games, the series will explore many unique genres and themes.\nCurrently the line features a 4X/Civ game called Tiny Epic Kingdoms and a cooperative Tower Defense game called Tiny Epic Defenders.\nTiny Epic Galaxies, a dice driven/engine building game is the third installment in the smash-hit-series!\nThe \"Tiny Epic\" series began at exactly this time LAST year with its flagship game Tiny Epic Kingdoms! Which has since been fulfilled and backers are LOVING IT!! \nClick to visit the Tiny Epic Kingdoms' Kickstarter page\nThe second game in the series is a thematic sequel to Tiny Epic Kingdoms called Tiny Epic Defenders.\nClick to visit the Tiny Epic Defenders' Kickstarter page\nAfter Tiny Epic Galaxies, gamers can expect to see more Tiny Epic games in the near future!

It is prone to many mistakes and that does not exclude experienced publishers.\n\nWe're proud to say that we are prepared for the task at hand and have years of experience in successfully fulfilling board game projects.\n\nHere are the steps we are taking to prepare and reduce the likelihood of mistakes and delays:\n\n1. We have done significant pre-production. This includes having all the art for the game completed and the graphic art over 75% completed. The production quote is in hand and ready to be initiated.\n\n2. We are proud to be working with Panda Game Manufacturing again, the same manufacturer I have used to create of Rise!, The Lost Dutchman, Dungeon Heroes, Fantasy Frontier, the Fantasy Gaming Figures,the GIANT Meeples, Tiny Epic Kingdoms and Tiny Epic Defenders. We have a great relationship with their entire team. We are familiar with their production requirements, timelines, payment schedules, communication methods and Chinese freight arrangements. Together we have created some great games and products and we hope that Tiny Epic Galaxies will be our next!\n\n3. Professional distribution is already in place, and we are proud to say it will be handled by Ship Naked. They were responsible for having fulfilled the shipments of Rise!, Dungeon Heroes, Fantasy Frontier and Tiny Epic Kingdoms. All were delivered on schedule with professionalism and reliability. Ship Naked has proven to be communicative, punctual and customer service minded when dealing with Gamelyn Games' customers.\n\nAgain, this isn't to say that this project won't experience mistakes, they happen to everyone but it does show that this road is familiar to all parties involved.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAbove all, I am 100% dedicated to backer communication.

Want King Down? It's not too late. Click here to pre-order.\nFrom the four corners of the land come four pretenders to the throne, each claiming to be the rightful heir. As the four would-be Kings march towards the capitol, they gather their armies, preparing for battle.\nOne comes for Glory. One comes for Greed. One comes for Blood. One comes for Honor.\nWill you summon the strongest army? - Will you be the first to take the capitol? - Will your magic outwit your opponents? - Will you be the last King standing?\nKing Down is an epic strategy game for 2-4 players, where each player allies themselves with one King, hand picks their army and goes into battle by competing to take down the other Kings and cross the board to victory.\nDescribed as \u2018the prequel to Chess\u2019, King Down incorporates age-old, intricate and fascinating mechanics from \u2018the Game of Kings\u2019 but breaks all the rules by reimagining the classic pieces, introducing brand new characters, and including new spell cards, strategies, tactics and win conditions. King Down is a brand new game that will stand the test of time and last the ages.\n\n\"King Down is really its own game with new objectives and a very different feel. And it doesn\u2019t hurt that it looks spectacular. Whether you like chess or not, King Down is worth checking out.\" GeekDad\n\"I can assure you this one, just like The Agents, is going to be a winner. The game is already pretty tight, quick, and highly entertaining. It\u2019s both immediately familiar, yet fresh and new feeling at the same time.\" Purple Pawn\n\"Saar Shai's creativity and love of creating games that are both visually stunning and mentally stimulating is evident from the very start. Every detail seems painstakingly worried over resulting in a quality product that is one part game and one part art.\" Father Geek\n\"King Down has proven an interesting little game to play. It\u2019s downright entertaining.\" Little Metal Dog\n\"It's a well balanced game. It's a nice, tight game. I definitely give it two thumbs up\" Got Game Testers\n\u201cKing Down\u201d, all in all, is a brilliant idea. Grandmasters and newcomers alike would be remiss if they let it pass by without at least checking it out.\" Dad's Gaming Addiction\n\"King Down isn\u2019t just a more beautiful take on chess; it\u2019s a faster-paced, harder-hitting, more enchanting adventure entirely. King Down has the potential to become a new classic, expanding on a universe we thought we knew.\" Nerdspan\n\"This one seems really rather too cool to pass on by.\" Nearly Enough Dice\n King Down features four unique Kings each with their own set of unassailable powers.\nEach King has an army of loyal subjects, presided over by the enchanting but lethal Queen.\nEach army also includes a brand new expansion of pieces known as \u2018Keepers of the King\u2019 - a motley crew of powerful but capricious characters.\nBow (a.k.a The Archer) can \"take\" pieces from a distance, without moving, while Beast (a.k.a The Beast) cannot move, unless it is taking another piece. Bash (a.k.a The Paladin), on the other hand, can move quite freely, yet he himself is taken whenever it takes. Block (a.k.a The Guard) cannot take, yet no other piece can take him down. As for Cog (a.k.a The Maester), well let's just say he's a very resourceful guy...\nPLAY\n\nTHE AGENTS is Saar's first game, released on Kickstarter in 2013, and followed up by THE AGENTS RETURN earlier in 2014. Set in a world of spies, secrecy and subterfuge, this tactical card game for 2-5 players appeals to both casual and hardcore gamers.\nSaar Shai - Creator of King Down. Saar is one of those quirky inventor types, who not only has outlandish ideas from his armchair but also gets off his butt and works really hard to make them a reality. Two years ago, Saar decided to turn his full-time attention to his long-term love - gaming.  Saar devised a unique, new mechanic known as \u2018double-edged cards\u2019 and designed a tactical card game around it. \u2018The Agents\u2019 was the unexpected success story of the Kickstarter gaming world in 2013, and with an awesome, supportive community spurring him on, Saar is thrilled to now be able to introduce himself as a \u2018game designer\u2019 when he meets new people at dinner parties.\nDream Catcher was founded by Rafi Ben Aharon and Nadav Shlomo Giladi. Rafi has more than a decade of professional experience in 3d animation, and has worked as an art director, character designer, 3d modeler and animator on Feature films, TV series and commercials. In parallel he practices traditional art and practical effects making, creating sculptures, toys and costumes. Rafi met Nadav at the premiere of one of the feature films he produced, introducing his ground-breaking Zombie movie. Nadav is a producer and a director, and recently presented the short film he directed at the Cannes Film Festival. Together, as Dream Catcher, they are even more than the sum of their parts. This is their first gaming collaboration and Kickstarter experience, and they are extremely excited and a little bit terrified.\nWith a fair bit of experience with print and packaging production and fulfillment and shipping under my belt from 2 successful Kickstarter Campaigns, I\u2019m now stepping up my \u2018game\u2019 to go into miniature production on a mass scale for King Down. I know that manufacturing intricate, high quality Minis is a different beast altogether, and I\u2019m being advised and mentored by some of the best in the business.\nI have built strong relationships with 4 established, leading manufacturers in the Minis production field, with 1 front-runner for my final production. I have worked out a robust production and fulfillment schedule, allowing for any unexpected and unforeseen costs, delays and challenges (\u201cexpect the unexpected\u201d) and have negotiated my socks off to keep costs down and tier pricing as low as possible.\nThe figurines will be produced in highest quality PVC, the industry standard, and will range between 28mm-35mm in height. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe greatest risk is undoubtedly the production of the Minis. The intricacy and complexity of manufacturing the figurines is the most challenging aspect of this project. And that\u2019s why I have established relationships with 4 of the leading production houses for Minis in China. Although I am working towards closing the agreement with my first choice of manufacturers (an industry leader with an excellent reputation), I have purposefully got detailed quotes and plans in place with 3 other companies, as a back-up and safeguard should any issues arise. As always, I will be exacting with my standards and will take an involved, hands on approach to every stage of manufacturing.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #23", "update_userinfo": "Let's Boogie!", "update_content": "PLAY"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #22", "update_userinfo": "New Rules!

CLICK HERE to join our newsletter for updates and reminders so you don't miss the next one!\nThe retail versions of Hostile Intent and Hidden Agenda will be available in stores by late November.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe Resistance gets even bigger with a special edition expansion that combines the two upcoming Resistance expansions (Hidden Agenda & Hostile Intent) and includes promo items that won't be included in the retail versions.  One box - eight new ways to play!\nNew \"You are Awesome\" rewards added - CLICK HERE or HERE for details.\nAvalon & 1st edition compatibility questions? - CLICK HERE for answers.\nIndie Boards and Cards is very excited to announce these exciting expansions for all the fans of our hugely successful game: The Resistance.  The expansions include several different module rules that can be mixed and matched, so the permutations of how you can play is practically limitless.. A copy of Resistance is required to play these expansion modules.\nNew to The Resistance?\nThe Resistance was Indie Boards and Cards' first break through success when released in 2010.   The game is now available in over 20 different languages and enjoyed around the world.  The best way to experience understand this simple, but immensely enjoyablegame of deception and deduction is to watch it in play.  Wil Wheaton's TableTop episode featuring The Resistance is an excellent way to experience this game for the first (or thousandth time):\nYou will be able to add The Resistance to your rewards after the project ends.  More details can be found in the \"add-on\" section below.\nHostile Intent\nBoth the retail and kickstarter editions of Hostile Intent will include the Hunter, Inquisitor and Reverser modules:\nHunter Module: The battle between resistance and imperial has become more intense.  It is no longer enough to target facilities in missions - the target has become personal as both sides look to neutralize their opponent's leaders.  In this module both the resistance and spies must identify a specific individual among the opposing team to win.  Hunters introduces many new game concepts that bring a whole new level of deduction and deceit into The Resistance.\nReverser Module: Reversers have the ability to change the results of any mission \u2013 in the hands of the resistance this can make a doomed mission succeed, or turn certain victory into defeat. A very interesting and potentially chaotic twist that is certain to change your meta game forever.\nInquisitor Module: The Inquisitor is an optional player ability first seen in Avalon. The player with the Inquisitor will be able to look at the affiliation of another player and is a simple way to ensure every game is full of interest twists and turns as the Inquisitor uncovers the truth (at least their version of the truth).\n\nHidden Agenda\nBoth the retail and kickstarter editions of Hidden Agenda will include the Assassin, Defector and Trapper modules:\nAssassin Module:  Every since we announced The Resistance: Avalon the request has been to take the exciting new roles from Avalon and make them available for The Resistance.  We are very excited to now make that available - the Assassin module of Hidden Agenda contains all the Avalon roles, rethemed and renamed to fit into The Resistance Universe.\nDefector Module: Two variants in one, the Defectors were included as part of the Avalon promos.  In one variant, the Defectors can switch allegiance during the game - ensuring that players are never quite certain who to trust.  In the second variant version the two Defectors know each other - ensuring that the accusations of deceit begin from the very opening of the game.\nTrapper Module: Every proposed Mission Team includes an extra person that won't go on the mission.  The leader will isolate a team member and watch their every move - making sure they can't make the mission fail. If you are a spy on the Mission Team, you\u2019ll never know if you will cause a mission to fail or simply be giving your identity away. But resistance members will have to approve some missions knowing that a spy is on them and trust that the leader chooses to isolate the spy.\nKickstarter Edition Promos:\nNot included in either the retail versions of Hostile Intent or Hidden Agenda are the Rogue Agent and Sergeant Modules.\nRogue Agent Module: Rogue Agents march to a different drum, whether Spy or Resistance they have their own victory conditions and would rather win by themselves than see their side victorious. Rogues are the first players in The Resistance that have a unique victory condition and are very interesting play option.\nSergeant Module:  First seen in the Avalon promo as Excalibur, the Sergeant is designated by the leader with ability to change mission results.  A very tricky proposition and sure to have everyone second guessing when to use, and when to just threaten with this ability.\nWhat more than one?\nEach pledge level has text that says \"Add $x for each additional copy\", increase your pledge amount by x to get a second copy of the Hidden Agenda & Hostile Intent Kickstarter Edition (yes, that does include the promo items). For example - if you are in the US and want 2 copies, select the $20 level and pledge $36.\nEssen Pick up\nOur plan is to have Hostile Intent & Hidden Agenda Kickstarter edition ready in time for Essen. It may be the case that we have games at Essen several weeks before the kickstarter backer copies are sent. It may also be the case that we are unable to get games to Essen in time. If you want Essen pick up - DO NOT PLEDGE FOR THIS PROJECT - all you have to do is sign up for our Essen email list by giving an email address: http://eepurl.com/RzQE9. Shortly before Essen we will ask you what you would like to pre-order for Thursday pick up at Essen. All the specials & promo items will be available - your support is very valuable to Indie Boards and Cards and we look forward to seeing you again this year with lots of great new games.\nAdd-ons\nAs a special reward for kickstarter backers and as a result of the advances we\u2019ve made in reducing shipping costs, we are able to offer great prices when adding some of our older titles when you pledge for Hostile Intent & Hidden Agenda Kickstarter Edition. After this project is closed, we will open Add-ons via paypal for backers. DO NOT ADD $ TO YOUR PLEDGE FOR ADD-ONS. Add-ons are for retail editions of the games listed below (no promos included) and will be sent with your rewards from this project (in November). All of these games are available right now at your local game store:\nThe Resistance\nThe Resistance: Avalon\nCoup\nCoup: Reformation (Coup Expansion) \nFlash Point Fire Rescue\nUrban Structures (Flash Point Expansion)\n2nd Story (Flash Point Expansion)\nExtreme Danger (Flash Point Expansion)\nDangerous Waters (Flash Point Expansion)\nVeteran & Rescue Dog (Flash Point Expansion)\nSnowdonia Jungfraubahn & Mt. Washington (Snowdonia Expansion)\nHaggis\nWhy Kickstarter?\nThree reasons really. First \u2013 I am very excited about this special edition of the expansion - I am only able to offer it (with all the extra costs that it has) if I get a minimum number of committed backers.  \nSecondly, it is all about cashflow. The time between when I pay for games (now) and when I get paid for them is upwards of 7 months, and that is in the best of circumstances. That takes a lot of money sitting in inventory, a bad thing for a small company.\nThirdly, I really wanted to be able to get a lot of little extras made for the biggest fans of the game. Kickstarter really is a great platform to do that through.\nWhat are Kickstarter Funds used for?\nYour pledge dollars go directly into making the pledge rewards, and shipping them to you. We have invested in getting the project to this point where its ready, your support ensures that we have the cash to pay our printers to make the games - the most costly part of game production.\nAbout Indie Boards and Cards\nIndie Boards and Cards started in 2009 as an independent publisher of great game designs. In 2010 we released three games, all of which have been well received by critics and fans alike. Our biggest seller has been The Resistance - a game of secret identities, deception and deduction that is now or will soon be available in 20 languages around the world. In 2011 we released Flash point: Fire Rescue, which has also been very well received and now available (or soon to be) in 10 different languages.  In 2012 we released the humorous game of certain death - Gauntlet of Fools and in 2013 we added Coup and Snowdonia to our portfolio.   Be sure to look for all these great games wherever you shop. If your favorite game store doesn\u2019t carry our games, please ask them to!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIndie Boards and Cards currently has two other projects that are due to be shipped in August 2014 (Coup Reformation & Dragon Slayer). Those games have already been produced and are on ship heading to distribution centers before being sent out to backers.\n\nIndie Boards and Cards has successfully delivered a number of previous kickstarter projects to thousands of supporters. We expect that our previous experiences will enable us to also deliver this project on time. That said there are always complexities and considerations in a project of this scope that may cause delays. Indie Boards and Cards will use contract manufacturing to make this game, freight forwarders to get games through customs and 3rd parties like Amazon, the US Post Office and FEDEX to ship the games to you - we don't control everything and there are lots of opportunity for delay. Other conditions may also cause delays - earthquakes, alien invasions, asteroid attacks, zombie plague are but a few of the myriad of reasons we may not be able to deliver this project in a timely manner.\n\nThis is a first edition of the expansions - by pledging to this project you are agreeing to be an early adopter and the extra items that are included in this edition (that aren't in the retail version) are your rewards and incentives for being an early adopter. But even with multiple edits, and constant proofing there may be minor typos, or grammar usage that is annoying to you in your rewards or other little things that would have been nice to have avoided but don't affect how the game is played. Mistakes that materially affects game play will of course be addressed but sometimes there are are minor errors that might be distracting but do not affect game play that I can't justify correcting. So if minor errors get under your skin and make it itch then you probably don't want to be an early adopter and are better off waiting till you've had a chance to see the final product and then buy it in your local hobby store. Kickstarter is not for everyone and I leave it to you to decide if you should be getting in on a first edition of this expansion.\n\nMy pledge is that I will deliver what I said and have written this project page as concisely and clearly as I can. So please read everything on this page - every kickstarter project is unique, and the commitments I am making to you regarding this project are completely defined here.\n\nA particular challenge to a project like this is negativity - I love your input, and really enjoy all the great suggestions that come from the large majority of our supporters. I can't include all the suggestions that I get, nor can I give you specific feedback other than noting that I do read all the comments and messages sent to me. So think before you post - threats, ultimatums and entitlement are unlikely to get you what you are asking for, and very likely that everyone else (myself included) will get less.\n\nRefunds - things happen and sometimes you need to get your money back. If you ask (before it's been submitted for shipment to you) , I'll refund your pledge less 20% to cover the costs that I can't recoup and costs of processing that refund. So think before you pledge - you can of course always remove your pledge before the funding deadline - but don't expect to get a 100% refund just because you forgot to remove your pledge before the project end ;)\n\nChanges - Images shown here are of the final art - however while it is not expected changes may be made before final production both to the art work and game contents. Variations in the production process and monitor calibration may cause alternations from the screen images to what appears in physical form.\n\nHave an issue? Send me a note - and please don't support us if you aren't satisfied with what the project is returning to you. Nothing would make me happier than having 100% of my supporters be 100% satisfied with their pledge rewards!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #26", "update_userinfo": "Resistance App Testing - Friday June 17th 4pm to 7pm at the Origins Game Fair", "update_content": "Testers wanted!\nWe are getting closer to the release of the Resistance App, and we'd like our backers to have the first look and help us test this ground breaking app. When we first discussed the app, I imagine that most everyone was thinking it would be a simple \"announcer\" - but I had always wanted more than that.\nThe Resistance app that we've been developing has an announcer - but it also allows you to play the entire game on your mobile devices.

We couldn't have done it with you.  If you missed the Kickstarter and would still like to get a copy of Evolution with the stretch goals you can pre-order your copy on the North Star Games website.\nEvolution is a board game that will retail for $55. If you purchase it through Kickstarter, you can save money and also get the game a month or two before it's available in stores.  It plays in 60 minutes for 2-6 players ages 10 and up. \nIn Evolution, players create and adapt their own species in a dynamic ecosystem of limited resources and hungry predators.  Increase your species\u2019 Body Size and Population and give them traits to ensure their survival.  Traits like Hard Shell and Horns will protect your species from Carnivores, while a Long Neck will help your species get food that others cannot reach.  Gather your friends and family around the table and see who will survive, who will thrive, and who will become someone else\u2019s lunch.\nYou can learn more about the game on the BoardGameGeek.com:\nhttp://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/155703/evolution\nDownload the rules here: Evolution Rules\nEach player starts with one species.  At the beginning of each round, players draw 3 cards plus one for each species they have.  Each card is an evolutionary trait that can be added to a species.  Then each player plays one card into the center.  The number on these cards represents how much food will be available when it comes time to eat.\nPlayers then play cards to evolve and create new species.  Players may discard a card to increase a species\u2019 Body Size or Population, or to create a new species.  Players may also play cards as traits on existing species.  Each species may have up to 3 traits.\nWhen all players have finished playing their cards, the cards in the center are revealed and that much food is added to the watering hole.  In player order, players may then feed their species.  To feed, a player takes one food from the watering hole and places it on a species.  A species that has evolved as a Carnivore cannot eat from the watering hole - it must feed by attacking other species.  When all species have eaten their fill or the watering hole is empty, feeding ends.\nAll players score the food they ate for the round by placing it in their food bag.  Any species who didn\u2019t get anything to eat goes extinct.  At the end of the game the player with the most food, traits, and population wins.\nUndead Viking Reviews Evolution\n\u201cIt has a lot of very simple rules, but a lot of really deep game play\u2026I really enjoy the game.

The object is to make your theater the most spectacular in the city by booking the greatest and most diverse roster of acts that you can find (and afford!).\nThe game is won by achieving the highest score on the Success Track, which represents public approbation and goodwill. While money is an important part of running a successful theater, there've gotta be easier ways to make a living than dealing with a never-ending procession of ventriloquists, jugglers, and trained animals! No, you're in this business because greasepaint is in your blood, and you can't imagine a world without limelight.\nIn each of four turns, players bid on the right to select acts first and place those acts in their theaters. After your theaters are booked, you tally up scores to see who was the most successful. Good shows will drive up the reputation of your theater and influence the popularity of the types of acts that you book, but a flop can always set you back!\nIn The Big Time!, players take the roles of theater owners during the Golden Age of Vaudeville.  \nThe game is played in four rounds, each representing one week of one month during this halcyon era.  \nPlayer Setup\nAssign each player a Theater Playbill Mat according to their wont and place it in front of them, and place the matching Theater Marker beneath the Posterity Point track on the main board.\n Dole out an allotment of Big Time Money to each player, four of each denomination to a total of $24. This is a fixed amount, and will not change throughout the four rounds of play.\nRandomly place the six Act Type Markers on the starred spaces of the Public Opinion Track.\nLastly, give each player a Review Card at random. During the game, reviews will be assigned according to how well theaters perform, and are used to break ties. To offset the advantage given to unearned reviews during the first round, players receive bonus cash (Big Time Money cleverly marked with \u201cBONUS\u201d in red type) to be used for the first round only. The Smash gets an extra $3, the Boffo show $2, and the So-So show $1.\nSetting Up The Booking Agency\nDeal out a number of Headliners equal to the number of players plus one face-down, next to the \"Coming Soon\" slot in the Booking Agency (i.e., deal out five cards in a four-player game).\nDeal out the same number of face-down Troupers atop each Headliner.\nLastly, deal a like number of face-up Troupers: one atop each stack next to \u201cComing Soon\u201d, and in rows next to the \"Now Available - P.M.\" and \"Now Available - A.M.\" slots.\nThese Acts constitute the pool of talent from which the current week\u2019s Playbills will be constructed. Take a moment before setting your mind to the tasks before you to chortle over the delightful names and descriptions of the acts (...all of which are absolutely authentic, having been culled directly from vaudeville advertisements in vintage newspapers).\nBook Your Acts\nEach round is broken into seven Phases: In Phases 1 through 3 (Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday), theater owners (that is to say: you and your fellows) send talent buyers to the Booking Office with fistfuls of cash to secure acts for the weekend's show.  \nWhen a Playbill is complete, four of the five acts that comprise it will be Troupers, and the remaining act will be a Headliner. As acts are selected for Playbills, they should be placed from bottom to top, overlapping upwards as new acts are added. In this way, Playbills end up with a vaudeville poster-style display, with a picture of the Headliner on top!\nIt's Showtime!\nIn Phase 4 (Friday night), shows open and Box Office returns are totaled; players total up values of the Playbills they've assembled. The highest scoring Playbill will yield the best Review! Leading to...\nThe Talk Of The Town\nCome Saturday evening after the last curtain falls--that\u2019s Phase 5 to you and I--the heavy hand of Public Opinion falls upon us; acts involved with successful shows rise in popularity and acts that flopped fall in public estimation.\nHow'd We Do?  \nPhase 6 is a contemplative phase, a quiet Sunday morning when theater owners reflect upon their achievements and theaters are evaluated for their inclusion of popular act types, securing their reputations in perpetuity. (Read: Victory Points are awarded.)  \nTheaters will be fondly remembered for booking acts that were popular at the time! Each act type icon on a Theater Mat will score points according to its value on the Public Opinion chart: three points for acts in The Big Time, two points for acts in Hot Time, and one point for acts in Showtime. Small Time acts accrue no points for their bookers. Keep in mind that Headliners have two icons, and thus will always score twice.\nThat's A Wrap\nAlas, Monday morning finds stagehands sweeping aside the detritus of bygone shows, making ready the theaters for another week\u2019s work. Brooms whisk away sequins and broken banjo strings, and shovels are put to use cleaning up after myriad ponies and monkeys and chorus boys. This is Phase 7, Cleanup, where Playbills are cleared in preparation for the coming week.  \nAt the end of the fourth week's Scoring, whomsoever has amassed the most Posterity Points wins! Simplicity itself!\nGame Salute Guaranteed is our promise that The Big Time will be produced with quality components and that you will enjoy the time you spend with the game.

Players must join their Agents into Factions, assign Missions and take their opponents down, to gather intel and win the most points.\nFeaturing the captivating artwork of collaborator Danny Morison (aka Dark Mechanic), \u2018The Agents\u2019 will challenge your imagination and brain power as you plan, plot and scheme your way to victory.\nThe Agents gameplay is based on a unique, new mechanic we call \u2018Double-edged Cards\u2019. Each Agent card features a \u2018command\u2019 on one end of the card and \u2018points\u2019 on the other end. However, the direction in which you place the card will determine from which asset you benefit. If you choose to perform the command, one of your opponents will get the points. If you keep the points for yourself, an opponent gets to perform the command.\nThroughout the game, you\u2019ll need both commands and points to advance. Commands will allow you to manipulate Agents, control your Factions, and influence other players. But you\u2019ll need points to buy more Agents and Missions. And ultimately, the player with the most points wins.\nDeciding how to place each card will require strategic precision and calculated foresight, as you try to further your own goals, and prevent your opponents from reaching theirs.\n\"Once you've lived the inside-out world of espionage, you never shed it. It's a mentality, a double standard of existence.\" - John le Carre\nThis \u2018quick and dirty\u2019 Kickstarter campaign is a follow-up campaign to last summer\u2019s first outing for The Agents. It\u2019s a chance for you to get the (updated) original Base Set and (revised) original expansions, Kickstarter exclusive merchandise and of course, The Fancy Box. I\u2019ve also created 3 brand new expansions to add to the mix.\nBy listening to backer feedback, I\u2019ve also tweaked the rules by making subtle changes for substantial improvement to gameplay. A few screws tightened and some nips and tucks here and there gave birth to this \"The Agents Mark II\" version*. And this next production run will also see upgraded component quality, packaging and shipping methods, but with the same level of personal, attentive customer support.\n*If you own the original Kickstarter edition of the previous campaign, you can download the Mark II rulebook here, and the complete rules for the expansions here.\nEVENTS: Things just got real. This new deck is filled with cards that are played during and throughout the turns of the game, introducing unexpected events that force you to think on your feet and be ready for anything. Events make the game unpredictable and volatile. You\u2019ll need all your wits about you to stay ahead when everything around you is shifting.\nBREAK THE RULES: Screw the rules! Spice up your gameplay with rule-breaking cards that set up new game conditions from the start of the game that make every game different and much more dangerous. This mega-expansion includes 3 different expansions; a new Break-The-Rules deck, Commanders deck and Sites deck.\nBOUNTIES: Get your rivals to do your dirty work. By putting a bounty on an Agent\u2019s head, you can manipulate your opponents to do your bidding. This expansions forces you to enlist the help of other players to get the job done. But WHO is the job? This expansion also contains brand new, much requested, point TOKENS!\nWe've also beefed up the original expansions and made them available to new backers who want to get in on the action:\nSPECIAL AGENTS: Boost your deck of agents with a reinforcement of highly lethal professionals. Featuring new abilities and powerful commands that make gameplay even more intense and dangerous.\nPARTNERS: Team up with this group of highly skilled supporting agents that will keep you covered and add another dimension to the game.\nSECRET AGENTS: An elite unit of dead silent operatives who promote your objectives through the art of secrecy and disinformation.\nMISSION CRITICAL: High-stakes and high-jinx in this bundle of extra  missions. Perform brutal maneuvers and make painful decisions in order to win, and win big!\nThis is the Box of all Boxes. The sturdiest, most robust game Box ever imagined or produced. With reinforced sides, a strong magnetic closure, firm foam insert and room for the base set decks and each and every expansion, this magnificently designed Box is an integral part of \u2018The Agents experience\u2019.\n These figurines are true collectibles. Limited edition, limited run, they complete 'The Agents experience'.\nThe Agents Artbook is a must-have for all backers who are addicted to Danny\u2019s breathtaking artwork. This bumper Artbook contains full color prints of the artwork featured across the whole game as well as shows some \u2018behind the scenes\u2019 and \u2018making of\u2019 features. With anecdotes, fiction and annotations by Saar and Danny, this is a true collector\u2019s piece.\nFor the first time, you can display full color prints of artwork from The Agents in your home, your office or your safe-house. Danny has created brand new pieces of art especially for this purpose.\nWe\u2019ve also done something pretty cool. We\u2019ve invited a few brilliant artists from around the world to let their imaginations run wild and create their very own take on \u2018The Agents world\u2019. Each artist has a uniquely different style, so these new illustrations bring a whole new perspective on The Agents and the dark, mysterious world of espionage that they inhabit. We have produced a limited number of highest quality posters - check out the full line-up here.\nMore games = more fun! If you just can't wait to get your hands on The Agents, we'll send you a first edition copy of the game as soon as the campaign ends so you can start playing it 3 months earlier. If you simply want to add more copies of the brand new base set to your bundle, go right ahead!\nSaar Shai (Agent \"Steel Storm\") - Creator of The Agents, Saar is one of those quirky inventor types, who not only has outlandish ideas from his armchair but also gets off his butt and works really hard to make them a reality. From flexible screen interfaces, to ring device controllers, and from game-theory platforms to card games with a twist, Saar's mind comes up with weird and wonderful ideas all centered on making the 'user experience' as fun, rewarding and engaging as possible. With a background in intellectual property and advertising and a day job running a start-up, Saar is now turning his first love - gaming - into his full time passion.\nDanny Morison (Agent \"Dark Mechanic\") - Illustrator of The Agents, Danny was brought up on a diet of 80's cartoons, lots of Transformers and also an early fixation with dinosaurs, so he began drawing from a very early age. He loves science fiction and fantasy, and especially how you could create worlds and characters with just your hands and imagination. After leaving university with an Illustration degree under his belt, Danny since worked as a storyboarder, character designer, concept artist, illustrator and poster and flyer designer, but never gave up his initial love of science fiction and fantasy. His style is maybe a bit different to the industry standard but he hopes to one day be able to live off what he loves doing most - creating fantastical worlds, colorful illustrations and drawing really, really big robots!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI believe that I've got the risks down to a bare minimum.

Just a whole lot darker.\" Says Cardboard Republic who included us in the PAX East recap, where we made the list of his 10 favorite things there, and the resulting preview.\nDJ Grandpa interviewed us for his crowdfunding podcast, DJ Grandpa's Crib.  Our interview starts around the 9 minute mark.\nYou are among a group of survivors, those that were smart enough to hide underground when war came to your city. While there are many people here, only a few of you have volunteered to venture out past the relative safety of your makeshift base in the tunnels. No one knows what is out there, but supplies are running out, and you need to find more if everyone is going to continue surviving. Staying alive isn\u2019t enough though, you need to start rebuilding, or at least making things a little more secure. Your team must explore the nearby tunnels in order to keep your base camp supplied with the food and resources necessary to rebuild.\nUnknown is a fully cooperative tile based exploration and survival game for 1-6 players.  Players create the game board by exploring tiles around their base, and attempt to keep the base camp stocked with food while gathering resources and performing actions to complete the mission\u2019s objectives. The players win when they complete the mission objective and accompanying minor objective. The players lose if the base runs out of food.\nA game in progress (prototype shown)\nA few of the characters and missions (prototypes shown)\nprototype contents\n14 Characters up from 8 thanks to 6 generous backers, plus one additional only for this printing \n8 Mission objectives, plus an additional 2 (and counting) only in this printing\n5 Minor objectives\n6 enemy types, including 5 custom meeple designs\nOver 100 tiles, including 8 different types of environmental hazards\nOver 100 meeples, cubes, discs and other wooden pieces\n  Prototype Custom meeple outlines for the enemies in the base game\n What you see in the photos and videos are our current prototypes, so even though they are nice as far as prototypes go, you can certainly expect some upgrades in the production version.  Tiles will be 2mm chipboard (think Carcassonne but slightly larger) and the tile backs will be printed with a non-distracting pattern that will better fit the theme.  The art itself is complete, but the graphic design of the cards, tiles, and quick reference sheet is still being ironed out to improve clarity and feel.  We haven't shown it yet, but the box insert is also something we are focusing on, making sure that all of the parts have a home and including room for all of the expansion parts as well.\nCustom wooden prototype box and early rendering of the production box insert, both with room for all of the base game and the expansion.\nFully cooperative.  There is no traitor and there are no points to muddy the goals. You either win as a team, or everyone starves together.  The game may be played solo or with up to 6 players, and because it is cooperative it can easily accommodate players leaving early or joining late.\nHighly Varied Gameplay.  One of our main goals is to ensure that no two games play alike, so we included four separate changing facets that interact in different ways every time. First, different characters' abilities change how you play since they gain bonuses to their particular role. Second, the mission objective sets the overall goal for the game, from simply scouting the area to more complex missions like rescuing refugees or defeating bosses. Third, the minor objective not only gives a second task to complete but also an additional bonus or ability once finished that will alter how the rest of the game is played. Finally, exploring tiles means that the board lays out differently each game, but the tiles in the deck also change each time so you never know what is coming.  While all of these parts are different, we worked hard to ensure that they are all balanced so that while the gameplay changes, the overall difficulty doesn't unless you want it to.\nVariable Difficulty .  Since the tile deck is built before each game by adding randomized creatures and hazards, it is easy to tune to the desired difficulty. If you want a more casual game, leave out an enemy or environmental hazard. If you want to fight more at the same overall difficulty, trade a few environmental hazards for an extra enemy.\nEasy to Teach and Quick to Start . The basic concepts and actions are easy to learn and teach; a new player can be taught enough to join the game in under five minutes. In most cases all of the information you need about a tile is right on it, and if it\u2019s not there it is on the player mats pictured below. All of the tiles are also color coded to make setup and break down quick and easy.\nThe front of the quick reference mat (prototype shown)\n Want an extra copy or some other thing we offer?  Here are the things you can add to any pledge of $55 or higher:\n1 extra copy of the game: $40  \n1 signed art book: $70 \nSmall digital art pack: $15 \nFull digital art pack: $30 \nTo add any of these, just adjust your pledge for the amount indicated, plus the shipping cost in the \"each other item\" column of the shipping chart.\nA major part of any game is the art and our artist, Boya Sun has done a fantastic job of bringing you into the world in the small space provided by tiles and cards.\n Characters\nEnemies\nHazards\n Objectives and Base Tile\nAll of the content for the base game is ready to go, and the art is already complete.  All we need now is help to fund the initial print run of the game.  Using conservative estimates, we expect final layout to take two to three months.  After that it is 30 days of proofing with the printer, 60 days for mass production, and 30 days for shipping and customs.  This puts the expected date for fulfillment of the base game at February of 2015.  The content for the expansion is complete, as is most of the art, but it still needs a bit of balancing which we plan to complete while the base game is in production.  If the funding for the expansion is met, this puts the delivery date for that at roughly April of 2015.\n Rob and Dave Games was formed in 2013 after two years of potluck dinner and game nights.  Every Friday we would gather for dinner, put the kids to bed, and then stay up way too late playing games. After 100 or so such gatherings we came to two conclusions. First, after playing a literal wall full of different games, a large part of our fun had become figuring out how to improve the games by tweaking mechanics. Second, playing cooperative games made it much more likely that everyone involved would have a good time. Putting these two realizations together, we decided to start building a team based game from the ground up.\nRob is a long time video and board gamer and a new Daddy. He spends his days working as a computer consultant and every spare moment with his 8 month old son-while working on Unknown. When not working on the game Rob loves spending his time with his wife Lisa hiking, biking, and basically anything active. The love of games began for Rob in high school with Magic the Gathering. That transferred to board games when he started visiting the local game store to improve his decks. What started with Settlers of Catan evolved to Dominion and has now exploded to an almost unhealthy game collection. A growing family and a friendly gaming group has led to the desire for more cooperative board games; hence Rob and Dave Games. Rob and his family spend Friday night at Dave\u2019s playing a variety of board games, and attending or hosting a Saturday game day at least once a month. Unknown is the first game he and Dave have been able to see come to life on Kickstarter, but we promise that more are brewing.\nDave is an ever busy father of two. With an active 4 year old boy and 1 year old girl Dave and his wife Terry are insuring the next gaming generation. Dave is the analytical compliment of Rob.  He enjoys the gamification of most things, and this along with a background in computers and restaurant management leads him to constantly analyze numbers and rework mechanics. Dave started gaming on computers with Tactical Armor Command on the Apple II, and has since progressed through many genres and forms of gaming.  Dave and Terry helped start this whole crazy gaming journey by inviting Rob and Lisa to their first PAX, PAX Prime, 6 years ago. Soon after that began Dave and Terry\u2019s weekly game nights, and from that was the drive to develop a cooperative board game that everyone would want to play.\nIn order to reduce shipping costs for international backers, we will be shipping rewards from multiple warehouses, hopefully one close to where you are.  To calculate the shipping cost to add to your pledge just find your destination and count the items (games and art books) in your pledge level. For example, if you are in Canada and pledge at the $125 level (game + art book) you would add $15 for the game (first item) and $5 for the book for a total pledge of $145.  If you pledged at the $55 level from Italy, you would add $25 for the game for a total pledge of $80.\n Here are some of the missions and characters we have featured in past updates.  Be sure to check back often as we add more!\nPrototype shown\nThe survivors have heard reports of an immense creature wandering the tunnels.  Previous attempts to defeat it have been unsuccessful, and so the new plan is to gather some of the more volatile chemicals stored about the tunnels.  Once enough have been gathered, a concentrated attack will hopefully overpower the Behemoth.\nThe mission will include 5 tiles, the first 4 tiles may be gathered to gain a toxic barrel token.  The 5th will spawn the Behemoth, and players must attack him with all 4 barrels before he reaches the base and decimates the population.  The Behemoth (modified to be tough but killable) may also be added to other missions as one of the random enemy tiles.\nPrototype shown\n The investigator excels at situational awareness, allowing her to assess the nearby area while gathering supplies.  After gathering, she may immediately explore an adjacent tile without spending an action.  The Investigator is usually best when at the fringes, and must plan well to best use her ability.  \nThe Captain is a master of teamwork.  His training helps him to motivate others, and pushes him to lead by example.  He gets a bonus action when starting near other survivors, and may also direct one of them to move for free each turn.  The Captain is best suited to traveling with others, and efficient coordination is necessary to make sure you make the most of his bonuses.\nPrototype shown\n The base is mostly secure, but what lies in the rest of the tunnels is (Unknown?) a mystery.  The survivors have been tasked with exploring far enough out that we can get a better idea of where we are and what is nearby.  Once we have an area mapped out, we can more easily patrol the perimeter and hopefully secure the interior.\nIn the Map mission players must explore tiles until there is a completed perimeter that is large enough to enclose a 9x9 square.  There are over 60 tiles in the deck and it only takes 34 of them to form a square that size, so what makes this a challenge?  The perimeter itself does not have to be a square, but every turn you are forced to take adds tiles to your path.  Enemies and environmental hazards will make you choose between efficient pathing and resource use.  Add in the fact that you still need to keep base supplied with food while you are exploring as quickly as possible away from base and this becomes even harder.\nPrototype shown\nTo improve the conditions at base camp, the survivors have been tasked with reactivating the local power grid.  There is still power running, but the system has been shut down.  Reactivating it requires synchronized commands from three of the control consoles scattered about the tunnels.\nThe mission adds three console tiles to the deck and the players must explore them all on the same turn.  This means that your odds increase as the remaining deck gets smaller, but also means that you lose time throughout the game when exploring one or two consoles at a time.  This mission encourages efficiency of actions and setting up the next turn for maximum exploration opportunities.\nPrototype shown\n Most of you made it to the camp, but there are still some people missing, and they need to be found. Some of the stragglers have family or friends here that want them found, and once the way is clear they will make their own way to base. There are more Refugees, but our camp can only support so many. We will find them and keep them safe for a time, but we will need to find another place for them to live in the long term.  \nBoth of these missions will utilize the Refugee tiles but require different strategies to complete. The Refugee mission is very time intensive, since the Refugees lower your AP when carried and must be carried around a good bit. This makes the players focus on keeping base stocked and planning their paths efficiently. The Stragglers mission is more about area control, making sure the Stragglers have a safe path back to base. This gives you the choice of guarding and escorting, or clearing the enemies and waiting, both of which have pros and cons.\nPrototype shown\nThe survivors don't really like the idea of eating the things that grow down here in the tunnels, but when you're hungry enough food is food. We've been collecting the food that hasn't spoiled, but the rest of it has been feeding an array of plants and mushrooms. If we collect enough of them, we should be able to test out which are edible and which aren't so the civilians can sort them out when we bring them back.   \nMinor Objectives provide a second task that must be completed for victory, but also give a perk once done to help you out for the rest of the game. This gives you something to split your attention and resources early game, and then a bonus later to help finish the mission. This minor objective requires players to return 5 plant tokens to base, and then test them with 2 medicine. After that, all plant tokens returned to base will turn into food. Since we don't know which are good and so gather a whole pile of them, survivors can only carry one plant token at a time. The earlier it is completed the better, and once completed can be a good deal of bonus food, but it requires that survivors rotate base-return duties instead of loading one person up. This creates interesting choices on how and when to spend the extra time and resource to complete it, and then alters the normal routine of food shipments to base.\nPrototype shown\nSome of the survivors want to extend the fortifications around our base camp. We should be able to salvage some usable fencing from any bunkers or workshops we find and put it to good use. It may be extra work, but it should keep everyone a bit safer, and save us a bit of walking in the long run. We should also work on improving our communication options. The abandoned bunkers usually have walkie talkies laying around, we just need some spare parts to fix them up. Hopefully with a clearer signal we will be able to talk each other through tasks that aren't usually our forte.  \nExtend Perimeter tasks players with gathering and using fences to increase their area of control. Once complete the fences allow trade with base and slow down approaching enemies. Layout of the fence can be used to overcome the constrictions of early-game hazards, or to fortify vulnerable points of entry. Walkie Talkies allows players to spend an action to take on the ability of a different character once completed. This allows you to choose the right ability for your situation, and can lead to impressive combos if used well.\n Want to show everyone that you backed us?

But this will be a learning process for us, and it\u2019s quite possible that we will hit unforeseen bumps along the way.\n\nFor production, we have a reputable company lined up and have quotes from them to ensure that our budget is reasonable.

Be sure to subscribe to our newsletter at www.IndieBoardsAndCards.com to be informed of our next project.\nHave a question? Be sure to \"Contact Me\" to get an answer >>>>>\nCoup gets even bigger with a special edition expansion.\nIndie Boards and Cards is very excited to announce this exciting expansion for all the fans of our hugely successful Coup kickstarter last year. That project exceeded even our highest expectations and I am confident that almost every one of our backers got a great game that they enjoyed and played with their friends.  It was clear that many of those friends ended up buying a copy for themselves because we went through a bunch in a very short amount of time (and are still waiting for the reprint of the retail version to arrive).  That kind of response is amazing, Rikki and I couldn't be more excited than to have so many people enjoy this great game.  Making games that are fun to play and get enjoyed around the world is why we make them!\nReformation is exciting expansion to Coup, and to celebrate the successes of the game we are launching a special edition of the expansion via kickstarter.  Reformation KS Edition starts off where our last project finished - it is a special version of the expansion that won't go into distribution and it already has all of its stretch goals unlocked.  If you want to be the first to get this special edition and get it at a great price then you will want to pledge for this project.\nAnd if you missed getting Coup last year, or want to get both the Reformation Expansion and the Coup base game at the same time we are also offering a special combination package (Reformation & Coup KS edition) that has many of promo items that you might have missed.\nIn addition to developing great games, we have also been focused on improving our US & international shipping processes.  That means we can offer even lower shipping costs to almost everywhere in the world and we are offering a special \"add on\" rates for those that might have missed out on one of our earlier releases.\nSo thank you in advance for your support - we are super excited to be able to bring another great title to your gaming table.\nDriven by their successes, the resistance has gained popular support and entire regions are in open rebellion.In a desperate attempt to stay in control, some government leaders are publically supporting the reforms demanded by the resistance.But allegiances are constantly shifting, and can be bought for the right price.\nThe opportunity for intrigue and bluff has never been greater.The cost of failure couldn\u2019t be higher.Even with talk of reformation, only one can survive.\nReformation is an expansion to Coup, a copy of Coup is required to play.Reformation adds Allegiances \u2013 players are either in support of the government (Loyalists) or the resistance (Reformists). Reformation also includes the Inquisitor variant, and additional role cards to expand play up to 10 players.\nOriginally introduced in a very limited edition at Essen 2013 that sold out in hours, Reformation is a perfect expansion to an already great game adding a new layer of manipulation and deceit for Coup fanatics. If you\u2019d like more information about Reformation please read this review posted here.\nIn the not too distant future, the government is run for profit by a new \u201croyal class\u201d of multi-national CEOs.Their greed and absolute control of the economy has reduced all but a privileged few to lives of poverty and desperation.Out of the oppressed masses rose The Resistance, an underground organization focused on overthrowing these powerful rulers. The valiant efforts of The Resistance have created discord, intrigue and weakness in the political courts of the noveau royal, bringing the government to brink of collapse.But for you, a powerful government official, this is your opportunity to manipulate, bribe and bluff your way into absolute power.\nTo be successful, you must destroy the influence of your rivals and drive them into exile.In these turbulent times there is only room for one to survive.\nCoup is a lightning fast game of bluff and manipulation for 2-6 players.If you are not already familiar with Coup - here is a quick overview and review from Tom Vasel, an industry leading reviewer:\n If you don\u2019t already have Coup, you will need to get it in order to use the Reformation expansion.The Reformation & Coup KS pledge levels (starting at $30) is a great way to get both at the same time or to upgrade your retail copy to include all the nice little extras of the kickstarter edition (alternative art cards & foil coins).\nWant to combine the two reward levels and get one (or more) copies of the Reformation & Coup Kickstarter Editions with one (or more) of the Reformation Kickstarter Editions?  See update #6 for details by clicking here.\nWe made this very easy for everyone and reduced the chances of a project delay at the same time!Based on our past kickstarter projects we are going to include all the stretch goals as soon as the project funds \u2013 we have everything ready to go to the printers to reduce the time between your pledge and when you receive your rewards.That might sound like a cope out, but this isn\u2019t a project where you get the planned retail version of the game and a few extras \u2013 the rewards in this project are a very special edition of this expansion that won\u2019t be available through game distributors.This project is really intended for the Coup fanatics out there!\nSo as soon we reach our funding goal, every copy of rewards will include these stretch rewards that won\u2019t be part of the Reformation expansion retail edition:\nGold Foil Box \u2013 To keep costs as low as possible, the retail version of Reformation is packed in a blister card and everything fits in your original Coup box.That won\u2019t work if you have either of the kickstarter editions; it certainly won\u2019t work if you have both the Reformation kickstarter edition and the Coup kickstarter edition.We\u2019ve redesigned the Reformation box in a very attractive gold finish that is sure to grab everyone\u2019s attention that sees it.But it isn\u2019t just a pretty face \u2013 we\u2019ve made the box slightly wider and taller so that it fits all the cards and coins with just a little extra room.It is still a compact box so you can bring it everywhere that you might want to enjoy Coup.\nMore Alternative Art Cards \u2013 The alternative art cards from kickstarter last year have been a huge success, so we are doubling down here and introducing two more sets of alternative art cards for all 6 characters \u2013 two new dukes, two new contessas, two new captains, two new assassins, two new ambassadors and two new inquisitors.These alternative art cards aren't just pretty to look at, they serve a functional purpose as they make slight modification to how the game is played with the potential to introduce more logic into the game.When combine with Coup kickstarter edition (or via the Reformation & Coup KS pledge levels) you will have enough alternative art cards to play up to 10 with unique art on every card.\nGold Foil Coins \u2013 Reformation doesn\u2019t really need any more coins to play than what comes in the Coup box, and the retail version won\u2019t have any additional coins.But these new gold foil coins really do shine, and they are so much fun to play with.Just don\u2019t let the other players target you because you have one!\nAnd if you back at the Reformation & Coup KS levels ($30 and above) you\u2019ll also get these stretch goals from our past Coup kickstarter rewards:\nAlternative Art Cards \u2013 The original set of alternative art cards for all 6 characters two different dukes, two different contessas, two different captains, two different assassins, two different ambassadors and two different inquisitors.In total it is enough to play up to 10 players with different art on every card \u2013 quite a fun experience especially combined with the Allegiance mechanics in Reformation!\nSilver Foil Coins \u2013 The shiny coins were a big hit and we are bringing them back for those that missed them the first time.These are something that the printer wasn\u2019t sure they could do, but they turned out great and add just enough to the game to really make it stand out on your table.\nFor a complete diagram of what comes in each version of Reformation - please see UPDATE #2 by clicking here\nAs a special reward for kickstarter backers and as a result of the advances we\u2019ve made in reducing shipping costs, we are able to offer great prices when adding some of our older titles when you pledge for Coup Reformation.Prices for each of these add-ons are shown as $X / $Y / $Z.US and Canadian Shipping address add $X for that item, EU addresses add $Y and every else in the world adds $Z to their pledge to get that add on.All add on items will be shipped at the same time as your Coup Reformation rewards and to the same address.These special prices are for the retail versions only and do not include promotional items from past kickstarter projects.\n The Resistance: $14/$19/$21 \u2013 watch it played on TableTop: \nThe Resistance: Avalon: $14/$19/$21 \u2013 Watch it played on Shut Up & Sit Down:\nFlash Point: Fire Rescue: $28/$35/$42\nUrban Structures or 2nd Story or Dangerous Waters (Flash Point Expansions): $10/$14/$15\nExtreme Danger (Flash Point Expansion):$28/$35/$42\nVeteran & Rescue Dog (Flash Point Expansion):$8/$10/$10\nWatch Drakkenstrike's video review:\nSnowdonia:$50/$60/$65 \nJungfraubahn & Mt. Washington (Snowdonia Expansion): $10/$14/$15\nWatch Rahdo\u2019s Video review:\nExamples of \u201chow to\u201d for add-ons:\nIf you back Coup Reformation for $15 (US Shipping) and wanted to add The Resistance & The Resistance: Avalon - you would select the $15 reward level and pledge $43 ($15 + $14 + $14).\nIf you back Coup Reformation for $20 (Canadian Shipping) and wanted to add Flash Point Fire Rescue and Urban Structures - you would select the $20 reward level and pledge $58 ($20 + $28 + $10).\nIf you back Coup Reformation for $23 (International Shipping, EU Address) and wanted to add Snowdonia and Jungfraubahn & Mt. Washington - you would select the $23 reward level and pledge $97 ($23 + $60 + $14).\nIf you back Coup Reformation for $23 (International Shipping, non-EU Address) and wanted to add Snowdonia and Jungfraubahn & Mt. Washington - you would select the $23 reward level and pledge $103 ($23 + $65 + $15).\nIf you back Coup Reformation for $29 (Brazil Shipping) and wanted to add Snowdonia and Jungfraubahn & Mt. Washington - you would select the $29 reward level and pledge $109 ($23 + $65 + $15).\nWe will ask which add-ons you wanted in the project survey that will be sent out shortly after the project ends.\nThree reasons really. First \u2013 while sales of the first edition of Coup were good, and I am very optimistic about this special edition of the expansion - I am only able to offer it (with all the extra costs that it has) if I get a minimum number of committed backers.  \nSecondly, it is all about cashflow. The time between when I pay for games (now) and when I get paid for them is upwards of 7 months, and that is in the best of circumstances. That takes a lot of money sitting in inventory, and that isn\u2019t something that we have a lot of at this time of the year.\nThirdly, I really wanted to be able to get a lot of little extras made for the biggest fans of the game. Kickstarter really is a great platform to do that through.\nWhat are Kickstarter Funds used for?\nYour pledge dollars go directly into making the pledge rewards, and shipping them to you. We have invested in getting the project to this point where its ready, your support ensures that we have the cash to pay our printers to make the games - the most costly part of game production.\nAbout Indie Boards and Cards\nIndie Boards and Cards started in 2009 as an independent publisher of great game designs. In 2010 we released three games, all of which have been well received by critics and fans alike. Our biggest seller has been The Resistance - a game of secret identities, deception and deduction that is now or will soon be available in 20 languages around the world. In 2011 we released Flash point: Fire Rescue, which has also been very well received and now available (or soon to be) in 10 different languages.  In 2012 we released the humorous game of certain death - Gauntlet of Fools and in 2013 we added Coup and Snowdonia to our portfolio.   Be sure to look for all these great games wherever you shop. If your favorite game store doesn\u2019t carry our games, please ask them to!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIndie Boards and Cards has successfully delivered a number of previous kickstarter projects to thousands of supporters. We expect that our previous experiences will enable us to also deliver this project on time. That said there are always complexities and considerations in a project of this scope that may cause delays. Indie Boards and Cards will use contract manufacturing to make this game, freight forwarders to get games through customs and 3rd parties like Amazon, the US Post Office and FEDEX to ship the games to you - we don't control everything and there are lots of opportunity for delay. Other conditions may also cause delays - earthquakes, alien invasions, asteroid attacks, zombie plague are but a few of the myriad of reasons we may not be able to deliver this project in a timely manner. \n\nThis is a first edition of the expansion - by pledging to this project you are agreeing to be an early adopter and the extra items that are included in this edition (that aren't in the retail version) are your rewards and incentives for being an early adopter. But even with multiple edits, and constant proofing there may be minor typos, or grammar usage that is annoying to you in your rewards or other little things that would have been nice to have avoided but don't affect how the game is played. Mistakes that materially affects game play will of course be addressed but sometimes there are are minor errors that might be distracting but do not affect game play that I can't justify correcting. So if minor errors get under your skin and make it itch then you probably don't want to be an early adopter and are better off waiting till you've had a chance to see the final product and then buy it in your local hobby store. Kickstarter is not for everyone and I leave it to you to decide if you should be getting in on a first edition of this expansion.\n\nMy pledge is that I will deliver what I said and have written this project page as concisely and clearly as I can. So please read everything on this page - every kickstarter project is unique, and the commitments I am making to you regarding this project are completely defined here.\n\nA particular challenge to a project like this is negativity - I love your input, and really enjoy all the great suggestions that come from the large majority of our supporters. I can't include all the suggestions that I get, nor can I give you specific feedback other than noting that I do read all the comments and messages sent to me. So think before you post - threats, ultimatums and entitlement are unlikely to get you what you are asking for, and very likely that everyone else (myself included) will get less. \n\nRefunds - things happen and sometimes you need to get your money back. If you ask (before it's been submitted for shipment to you) , I'll refund your pledge less 20% to cover the costs that I can't recoup and costs of processing that refund. So think before you pledge - you can of course always remove your pledge before the funding deadline - but don't expect to get a 100% refund just because you forgot to remove your pledge before the project end ;)\n\nChanges - Images shown here are of the final art - however while it is not expected changes may be made before final production both to the art work and game contents. Variations in the production process and monitor calibration may cause alternations from the screen images to what appears in physical form.\n\nHave an issue? Send me a note - and please don't support us if you aren't satisfied with what the project is returning to you. Nothing would make me happier than having 100% of my supporters be 100% satisfied with their pledge rewards!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #30", "update_userinfo": "Our Quest ends tomorrow!", "update_content": "Our latest social deduction game by Don Eskridge, designer of The Resistance and Avalon is ending soon on Kickstarter!"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #29", "update_userinfo": "Coup Brazilian Art Deluxe Edition", "update_content": "Just a short update to let everyone know that the kickstarter for Coup Brazilian Art Deluxe Edition is up (and in it's final hours).
