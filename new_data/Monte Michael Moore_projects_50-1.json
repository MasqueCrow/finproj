However, with La Muerta #1: Onslaught, all our additional rewards and stretch goals are standing by to print and all the creative work is complete! \n\nOur printing partners are secured (and they are fine with our edgy content), our budgets are complete, our shipping supplies are ready to order and our manpower is lined up. We just gotta print, receive, prepare, assemble, pack and ship. \n\nWe\u2019ve completed most of our other Kickstarter campaigns (and began shipping on all but two within 8 weeks of our campaign end date) and learned a bunch each time. And regarding rewards fulfillment, I\u2019ve owned mail order companies for over thirty (!) years. My team and I have extensive publishing and manufacturing backgrounds and ship on time (or reasonably on time). We prep and ship in a clean environment. We will make sure all your rewards are delivered as promised, packed securely. \n\nIf you\u2019ve backed us in the past you know this to be true. We take every phase of our campaign, including shipping, quite seriously (while having fun and listening to music doing it). \n\nYou can count on this: whether we have hiccups or not, we will be in communication with you during the entire process and update you in a timely manner. \n\nWe want to assure you that beyond making the coolest products possible, the printing, assembling, packing and shipping of these items in a top-notch manner is equally important to us. \n\nIn conclusion, I\u2019d like to thank all the readers, backers and collectors who have supported our last twenty three (!) Kickstarters. \n\nYour response to our work has been AMAZING! \n\nWe simply cannot thank you enough! \n\nBecause of you, COFFIN COMICS LIVES!!!! \n\nSWORN!!!!!!!!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 6 or more", "title": "1.

The first of a proposed comprehensive trilogy ('SILVER' and 'BRONZE') of art books, featuring a huge selection of work from over thirty five years in the comics industry by artist and writer Liam Sharp. Backers will also receive an all-new creator-owned 25 page comic, 'The Chronicles of Lib LaRoche', written and lavishly illustrated by Liam, completely free! And on top of that they'll receive an exclusive collectable card from a planned Tarot deck used in the Lib LaRoche universe.\n\nENCORE: GOLD features an incredible introduction by legendary writer Grant Morrison, a creator profile by renowned journalist and interviewer Geoff Boucher, and is a showcase of some of Liam's all-time favorite pieces.\nENCORE: GOLD - THE ART OF LIAM SHARP\nENCORE: The Art of Liam Sharp hardback cover mock-up\nBIOG\nLiam recently wrapped his ground-breaking and acclaimed epic 24 issue run on DC's The Green Lantern with Grant Morrison, and is currently working on Batman: Reptilian with superstar writer Garth Ennis. But before that, and before his award-winning six issue limited series 'The Brave and The Bold: Batman and Wonder Woman' (which he also wrote) and before the wildly successful 'Wonder Woman: Rebirth' with fan-favorite writer Greg Rucka, Liam had a long and distinguished career as an artist and also a writer of both comics and prose fiction. He has also been a well-regarded boutique publisher, co-founding both the Mam Tor imprint and the ground-breaking digital company Madefire. \nLiam has worked for Marvel, DC,Vertigo, Wildstorm, Image, Darkhorse, Fleetway and Dynamite, producing a huge range of eclectic work in every imaginable genre. Encore - The Art of Liam Sharp  is intended to celebrate this long, creatively restless and innovative career, and will be a must-have book for collectors, fans and new-comers alike. As Grant Morrison writes in his introduction -\n\n'Knowing the standards (Liam) sets for himself, witnessing first-hand the constant striving for new goals, new achievements, I\u2019d hazard a guess he has barely begun the latest phase of his artistic journey, is only now stretching his peacock wings as we his audience are invited to sit back and applaud the dazzling display\u2026'\nENCORE: The Art of Liam Sharp book with dust jacket mock-up\nABOUT THE BOOK\nAvailable with or without the Conan dust jacket, ENCORE 'GOLD' showcases work from across Liam's extensive career, presenting much of the hyper-detailed art in it's black and white unlettered form for the first time in print - from the spectacular high fantasy of THE BRAVE AND THE BOLD: BATMAN AND WONDER WOMAN, to the incredibly intricate sci-fi realms of THE GREEN LANTERN. \nWithin these pages you will also find many examples of Liam's full-color work - both traditional and digital - which pays homage to the masters of the past whilst also pushing boundaries and breaking new ground in the industry.\nThe cover to Liam's 'THE BRAVE AND THE BOLD: BATMAN AND WONDER WOMAN' series. Colors here by Romulo Fajardo JR.\nCatwoman Cover\n'MOULDERING STONES' featuring Red Sonja. A personal piece that ended up being a cover for Dynamite Comics.\nJudges Dredd, Death and Anderson from a poster produced for a feature on the artist in the Megazine.\nPromotional art for Liam's Manthing series with writer J.M.DeMatteis for Marvel - a favourite series for both creators\nEASTER EGGS!\nThe book also promises to contain a host of un-lockable Easter Eggs, linking to (amongst other things) a film shot by Liam's son, Lorcan, where he talks about his career, techniques and life-lessons. \n There will also be a unique opportunity to receive one of Liam's huge (18\" x 24\") original black and white pages (see below) from his iconic Green Lantern run with Grant Morrison for the first person to break a hidden code within the pages! \nSeason 1, page 10, issue 10 of THE GREEN LANTERN - unlock the code hidden in the pages of ENCORE 'GOLD' to win this page!\nABOUT THE COMIC\nAs the first stretch goal was unlocked, along with the book backers will now receive a free 25 page comic, featuring all-new material, and telling the origin of Liam's character Lib LaRoche - a gothic female Conan in a new-weird world of sci-fi and fantasy elements (previewed below!) \nLib LaRoche: Jubileumboek preview art\nPage from Lib LaRoche - placeholder lettering only\nLib LaRoche sample page - placeholder lettering only\nOFFERS\nENCORE 'GOLD' comes with multiple options:\nPDF only\nWithout dust jacket\nWith Conan dust jacket\nDust jacket and signature only\nDust jacket, signature and remark\nDust jacket, signature and exclusive bookplate \nDust jacket, signature with remark and exclusive bookplate\nDust jacket, signature, exclusive bookplate, original head sketch (3 options) \nDust jacket, signature, exclusive bookplate, original torso sketch (3 options) \n50% off for retail orders of 10X basic hardback and dust jacket edition\nExamples of previous torso sketches by the artist.\nFUTURE VOLUMES \nENCORE 'GOLD' 'SILVER' & 'BRONZE' box set mock-up\nENCORE 'SILVER\", the second volume, will be a celebration of the intricacy of pure black and white comic art.\nENCORE 'BRONZE\", the final volume, will feature a complete retrospective of Liam's career, from assisting the great Don Lawrence, through 2000ad, Marvel, Image, DC, and beyond. Over a series of interviews Liam talks to writer and teacher Dave Gillette about the trials and tribulations, good times and bad, and about the masters of the past that inspired him, and the artistic heroes that eventually became his friends. For comic historians it promises to be a goldmine, for aspiring artists there'll be a chance to hear first hand what it is like having a long career in comics and the visual arts.\n'SILVER' & 'BRONZE' are slated for publication late 2021 and 2022 respectively. \nThe slip case will be available for purchase with the third and final volume.\n\nBOOK SPECIFICATIONS\nENCORE - THE ART OF LIAM SHARP 'GOLD\"\nHardback with optional dust jacket\n144 pages\n7.5\" x 11\"\nFIRST STRETCH GOAL UNLOCKED!\nNow everybody who buys ENCORE:GOLD also gets the first ever 25 page Lib LaRoche comic free with the book, and what's more it will be signed by artist/author Liam Sharp!\nLib LaRoche comic #0 cover mock-up - not final art.\nSECOND STRETCH GOAL UNLOCKED!\nNow included with the book and comic will be one of a set of six cards, of increasing rarity! Five of them will be picture cards from the world of Lib LaRoche. The sixth will be a simple gold design with a QR code on it that will gift the owner something completely unique! \nOnly FIVE of the GOLDEN CARDS will be sent randomly into the world with the books, for you to discover!\nMock-up of the Lib LaRoche card set\nA brand new set will also be available with both ENCORE:SILVER and ENCORE:BRONZE.\nHuge thanks, as always, from Liam and all of us in Team Sharpy! \nTS\nFINAL STRETCH GOAL UNLOCKED!\nAfter asking around we decided on the final stretch goal, and it's going to be a great one for everybody who has backed this campaign. \nUltimately the free comic is fun, and the cards will be collectable and beautiful (more on that shortly!) but those things often get lost over time, and what's left is the book.\nSo with that in mind -\nTHE BOOK\nHaving hit $110K the book will have a page-holder ribbon, an embossed cover, and the dust jacket will have an added metallic ink. It already has heavy, high-end paper of the finest quality, and will be stitched and not glued. It will truly be a beautiful product!\nTHANK YOU ALL so much for the incredible support!!!\n\nBut also-\n\nUPDATE ON THE CARDS\nWhat I didn't say before, and what you are now just learning, is that Lib LaRoche uses cards as part of her character trait - no spoilers! There will only be two hundred copies only of each of the first five cards that will have a gold surround. So everybody who buys this book will automatically get one rare collectable card that will never be reproduced with the gold border again!

Each comic book will feature different artists, to ensure not only a high quality, but also creating a platform for  outstanding artists.\n\nThe story begins with Leona and Karmen arriving in Egypt in modern times. They are tricked by the Flow of Time and landed inside a pyramid. As they walk inside, they awaken ancient forces that attack them. Leona comes into conflict with the forces that attack her, while Karmen turns into an owl and seeks shelter somewhere in the pyramid. Leona ends up being captured and the villain reveals herself as an ancient Egyptian queen who felt the sands of time carried by Leona and knows that she could use them to restore her physical form and exercise her revenge against her enemies, the Sisterhood of Mummies.\n\nIf you wanna know more about the MIDNIGHT WITCH (even though you can read this crossover as standalone oneshot, as intended) then go to the Kickstarter HERE which launched simultanously. \"But I do not wanna pay double shipping?\" well, we got you covered here in this lovely video-update!\nISSUE ONE: the origin issue in which we saw the rising of the Sisterhood,  the  introduction of the Khepri god/computer and during a new adventure  Sisterhoods leader Rand is shown to share his mind with Dymonos!\nISSUE TWO:  High-priest Dymonos makes a heart-wrenching  discovery that not only lets him question his loyalty towards his master, the mighty god  Khepri, but also sets him on a path of righteous revenge and  destruction.\nISSUE THREE: Love & Betrayal in a solo-issues as Gwynn takes center stage and combats Nazi Werewolves in a fight till the death - all in ONE intense issue.\nYou can order all of these as an Add-On.

As his contact list grew,  so did his interest in the complete field of comics. Starting up a Bad Grrl Comics Fan club in 2001 was the first step to go further then his own living  room. Soon thereafter he began setting up websites for Arthur Suydam, Eric Basaldua, Broadsword Comics, and focusing on titles like Vampirella,  Cavewoman, Hack/Slash and more... He even  started working with the FACTS comicon organization where he also met  the founder of Broken Frontier and shortly thereafter began doing headlines for this news site. Later he founded the website COMICSFORSINNERS which more resembles his prior BadGrrl fanclub. Nowadays Richard dabbles in Art Agency, sending out comic Press Releases and since 2019 publishing various comic books.\n\nYonami - Paulo Teles (AKA Yonami; Creator) is a Graphic Designer by  graduation and comic book artist for passion, works as manager for House 137 Studio and  along with his team has provided stories for publishers such as Stone Arch Books, Glyph Productions, Galaxy Graphix, Dynamite, Zenescope, Marvel and DC through the years. Today, the House 137 Studio got a partnership with the accessibility company All Geek and  created the All Geek Comics brand for publishing their books in Brazil.\n\nRodrigo \"Rod\" Monteiro (Writer) is a Brazilian writer who has been working in the comic business for the past nine years, being part of the Brazilian House 137 Studio since its foundation in 2015. Among his published material is \"The Midnight Witch\", \"The Fairy Tales Unit\" and \"Undead  Nightmare\". All of them are currently available (in English) at the  Webtoons website.\n\nCezar Razek (artist) is a Brazilian artist who has been working in the comic business for many years, with Battlestar Galactica over at Dynamite and also the inter-company crossover between TopCow and DE with Witchblade/Red Sonja. He has also worked on Stargate, Vampirella, Doc Savage, Dejah Thoris, Zorro, and many more!\n\nWalmir Archanjo (cover artist) is a modest guy and a very committed professional with many published works such as the kid's book, the Whispering Peppers.\n\nBrad Chavarria (Guest Artist + cover artist) fell in love with comics at about age 4.  \"I was able to get a few sketch card gigs of Red Sonja,  Witchblade, Vampirella and Warlord of Mars, that gave me my first \"pro\"  work. It helped establish me and it gave me a sense of belonging in this  wonderful art community.\nNow, I was offered this WONDERFUL opportunity by Richard Boom, who was  one of my \"original\" Crusade forum friends from about 2 decades ago, to  produce a cover for this Kickstarter event, of which I will be forever grateful.\"", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nActually I have FIVE books all done like this...

We take every phase of our campaign, including shipping, quite seriously (while having fun and listening to music doing it). \n\nYou can count on this: whether we have hiccups or not, we will be in communication with you during the entire process and update you in a timely manner. \n\nWe want to assure you that beyond making the coolest products possible, the printing, assembling, packing and shipping of these items in a top-notch manner is equally important to us. \n\nIn conclusion, I\u2019d like to thank all the readers, backers and collectors who have supported our last twenty two (!)

The idea here was to ensure that most backers would receive their packages within a few days of each other. While this strategy has worked well for us in the past, Coffin Comics HQ has limited warehouse space and it has become increasingly challenging for our team to fulfill campaigns in this manner, as our operation has grown significantly over the last couple of years.

So I'd like to \"level up\" some rewards and stretch-goals as we progress! Fun isn't it? Hey! That means YOU, the awesome backer, gets more freebies!\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nHello! My name is Anna Zhuo. I'm a self-taught artist that works with both traditional and digital mediums!  My work is heavily inspired by anime/manga. I work with ink, watercolor, copic markers, and digital on my PC and iPad Pro. I am a published artist, best known for doing cover work for many retailers. Some covers I have done are for popular titles such as Vampirella, Lady Death, Unnatural, The Magic Order, Mercy, Fathom, and Hit-Girl.\nIMPORTANT: If you are new to Kickstarter, please be aware that there will be a backer survey that is sent out at the end of a successful campaign. This is when your order will be finalized with all your add-ons. Filling out this survey is crucial so I can make sure you are getting 100% what you are paying for!\nSKETCH4RT is a line of art books I am starting that features black/white sketches, process sketches,  anatomy studies, unused or rejected covers, ink drawings, and much more! This specific book features works from 2010-2019. It'll start with my most recent works to oldest, a trip down memory lane! The purpose of organizing it this way is to show that what we all started somewhere. It is through many years of hard work, practice, and dedication to get to where we are today.  Remember, practice makes progress. There are 3 different options for this book: Standard, Hardcover, and Collector's Edition.\nStandard/Hardcover has the same art and 80 pages, while Collector's has alternate cover art and extra 20 pages (100 pages in total)! Hardcover is now limited print-to-order and will be numbered! It means the amount printed will equal the amount ordered here!\nPersonally, I've always been fascinated to look through doodles and sketches by other artists. I enjoyed seeing the progression of a piece of art, figure out what the artist might be thinking, how they see things, and etc. On top of that, I liked seeing how an artist has progressed over the years.\nCollector's Edition has an alternate cover art and features an additional 20-pages that includes my most recent work, published covers and it's process. To make it even more of a collector's item, it is limited to 100 copies world wide, signed and personally hand-numbered!\nThis is also PRINTED IN THE UNITED STATES! The cost of production is higher than overseas, but I'd like to support small companies of my own country. This also ensures faster turn-around time, higher-quality product, and best customer service.\nPlease read over each reward tier to see which one you'd like to pledge. Most items are also available as add-ons or combined with existing pledges. Some are also limited options. Once you make a pledge, you can change it/adjust. When the campaign ends and you are charged, you will not longer be able to change it.\nFREE GOODIES! ! ALL PHYSICAL BACKERS WILL RECEIVE ALL UNLOCKED STRETCH GOALS! Once fully funded, additional pledge amounts will unlock new incentive goodies that will be included in your pledge rewards, for FREE! More will be added along the way when new goals are met!\nSOME STRETCH GOALS HAS LEVEL-ED UP ! Meaning you'll get extra rewards! Three golden tickets will also be randomly inserted to 3 different backers boxes for a chance to win more goodies!\nUPDATE: IF AN ITEM IS SOLD OUT, it can no longer be added as an overpledge!\nWant to add more items to your selected tier? No problem! In order to add-on an item or combine another item from another tier to your existing pledge, you will have to do an 'overpledge'! (Only certain rewards are allowed as add-ons!)\nPlease make your initial pledge.\nAfterwards, go to \"MANAGE MY PLEDGE\" button located up top.\nAdd the additional $$ amount of the other rewards you'd like.\nAfterwards, please message me your request through Kickstarter.\nEXAMPLE:\nYou pledged $20 Standard edition tier, but would also like to add the hardcover edition ($40). Go to \"manage my pledge\" and add additional $40 to your total. You pledge amount should now be $60.\nWhen you message me, I will make a note to your pledge. You don't have to do anything else until the campaign ends! If you do end up changing your decision, please let me know.\nAll rewards will be shipped via USPS Priority Mail due to the size and weight of the books. From experience, this is the most safe, quick, and inexpensive way for both domestic and international packages. Shipping will take 1-3 days for US, and 6-10 days for international. Insurance will be added equal to the amount that you have pledged.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWith every project, comes risks and challenges, especially uncertainties that may come due to COVID-19. There could be delays, limitations on outing and incoming shipments. That is why I have selected a printer I have worked with before, based in the United States. This guarantees quick turn around time compared to overseas. All stretch-goal incentives are also made and printed in the United States.\n\nThis is my second self-published book.

As his contact list grew, so did his interest in the  complete field of comic. Starting up a Bad Grrl Comics Fan club in 2001  was the first step to go further then his own living room. Soon  thereafter he began setting up websites for Arthur Suydam, Eric  Basaldua, Broadsword Comics and focussing on titles like Vampirella,  Cavewoman, Hack/Slash and more... He even started working with the FACTS comicon organization where he also met the founder of Broken Frontier and  shortly thereafter began doing headlines for this news site. Later he  founded the website COMICSFORSINNERS which more resembles his prior BadGrrl fanclub. Nowadays Richard  dabbles in Art Agency, sending out comic Press Releases and since 2019 publishing various comic books.\nMarkus von Renthe-Fink: Story Editor / story 1 penciller\nMarkus has loved comics and creating art since childhood. His road to creating comic books, though, took several detours. After graduation he had to admit to himself that it would be next to impossible to make a living by drawing comics in Germany, and relocating to the US wasn't really an option, even though at this point his drawing abilities were quite good. So he spent the next 20 years in the dreary profession of a graphics deisgner. It took a pep talk from fan-favorite artist Greg Capullo during a book signing in Frankfurt to get Markus back on track; after being told that in the meantime, the \"bullpens\" at the publishers had ceased to exist: all you needed nowadays to break into comics were talent, a scanner and an internet connection. With newfound enthusiasm, determined to take the comic book world by storm (or, failing that, a gentle breeze), Markus set out to find a partner-in-crime - enter Richard Boom, who was happy to take Markus aboard. Initially (and rather inadvertently) he took on the role of story editor, trying to bring some sort of order and continuity to she sprawling wealth of material that represented the \"Sisterhood\" universe. Hungry to get his teeth into the actual creation of art, he took the script for a 10-page story apart at the seams (with the blessing of original author Viktor Kruithof) and hammered it into a full-length comic book story. These pages will see print as Sisterhood #2 sometime in the spring of 2020, and, as life sometimes comes full-circle, will feature a variant cover by none other than Greg Capullo. \nDeviantart  Portfolio\nFacebook: The Art of Markus von Renthe-Fink\n\nRenee Rienties: story 2 penciller\nRenee Rienties is an independent comic artist from the Netherlands.\n                        She made her start in the world of comics in 2016 with her smallpress book \u201cMy Daily Life Comics\u201d which was received well by her readers online and at comic conventions.\n                        In 2017 her art took a dark turn, from funny cute gag comics to creepy bloody horror. Here she worked on a story in \u201cOyasumi\u201d A manga collaboration she started with two fellow artists. Where she drew her comic \u201cDistortia\u201d  Her creepy art will leave a chilling impression for you to remember.\n                        In 2018 she worked on a chilling short story in the \u201cHollandsch Manga\u201d anthology series made by various Dutch artists.\n                        If mystery, thriller and horror are your thing, then you have something to look forward to. Right now Renee is working on a new chilling book that will come out end of 2019.\n                        Website / links:\n                        Instagram: http://instagram.com/artofreneerienties/\n                        Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/ArtOfReneeRienties/\n                        Website: https://artofreneerienties.com/\nRichard, Ren\u00e9e and Markus\nBio's for the Original Artist, providing you some cool art-opportunities, via real commissions!\nGUEST ARTISTS:\nRALF VAN DER HOEVEN is an autodidact if you ever seen one. Hailing from the Netherlands, he is a well-received artist in the fantasy- and comic-community.\nAfter doing illustration work for Valkyrie and Artvlam he started a company with the Belgian Dominiek Vermandere called Lakoro. With Dominiek he's co-owner and creator of the new comicbook series for all ages named: Troltrol. (www.troltrol.be)\nThe first dutch book was recently published and is available.\nBesides that Ralf fills his time making several variant covers for Dark Dragon Books (The dutch-translated Deadpool and Lady Mechanika).\nHis dream of creating an original comicbook of his own is taking shape in his free time and besides that he's putting together his first ever fantasy artbook via Dutch Publisher Dark Dragon Books Art Collection.\nART GRAFUNKEL is designer by day, doodlemonkey by night, Belgian Waffle by birth, and nerdy by nature.\nHis  geeky artwork has been featured in VISIONS FROM THE UPSIDE DOWN: A  STRANGER THINGS ARTBOOK (Del Rey), TRANSMETROPOLITAN: ALL AROUND THE  WORLD (CBLDF), WORMWOOD: GENTLEMAN CORPSE (IDW) and he's doodled  sketchcards for STAR WARS GALAXY and MARS ATTACKS (Topps). He is a comicon-regular and brings smiles to folks he knows as well as folks he does not...\n                  He also thinks it's pretty pretentious, writing all of this third person.\nROBIN MIES is a Dutch illustrator, sketch card and comic artist.\nIn recent years he has made various sketch card sets under his own management, but he has also been able to draw for, among others, Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy vol. 2 and Thor: Ragnarok. Partly because of this, his illustrated blank covers are becoming increasingly popular.\nDISCLAIMER: all contributing artists (Ebas, Ryp, Capullo etc)  have agreed to me using their gifts to me under the condition that NO  profit will be made. ALL profits will be going towards the creative  team!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter\nThe comicbook is all written  and penciled. This kickstarter is set up mostly for making sure the  colorist will get paid and the book is printed.\n\nQuestions about this project? Check out the FAQ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nActually I have FOUR books all done like this, most of them even colored as well. So I want to come back here and make this a complete series of oneshots, showcasing new talents during this whole adventure!\n\n About this particular project: I have decided to only do a regular cover and one variant cover. This makes me certain the printing will not be a too big of a deal.\n\n Shipping will be done worldwide via the ultra-reliable German postal services as they reside just mere minutes away from my town. The extra perk of this, is the fact that Shipping via Germany is just as reliable as via my own country of the Netherlands, but cheaper for your wallet.\n\n I am failry new at this Kickstarter-game obviously, with Sisterhood #1 being my \"official\" debut. \n The complete art team is really excited about it and have already finished all the artwork (well, with the exception of all the awesome coloring and lettering and graphic design)!\n\n Although all are well versed in the industry, we do understand that there are possible unforeseen issues such as:\n Manufacture Delays \n Shipping Delays \n Story Editing Corrections \n Over-Robust Stretch Goal Fulfillment\n \nGiven this, I am very dedicated and committed to bring you an excellent comic book with quality products to ensure that

John Fleskes answers:\n\nI pride myself on having an 18 year record of publishing over eighty art books. I've run twelve previous Kickstarter campaigns with artists such as Brom, Frank Cho, J.A.W. Cooper, Jeffrey Alan Love, Gary Gianni and Mike Mignola (Hellboy: Into the Silent Sea Studio Edition), Petar Meseldzija, Richard and Wendy Pini (Elfquest), Mark Schultz, and Daren Bader and Lance HaunRogue. Most of these have been on time. We are very open with our backers and communicate through updates often to keep you up to date.\n\nIn some cases, things don't always go exactly as planned in the publishing world. Much of the time they do, but sometimes an unexpected problem or delay arises. In the rare case that this happens, simply put, I deal with it and find a way to get the job done. I am very open about any challenges and like to share in the process so people know what's going on. I don't like surprises, and don't feel anyone else should either. I respect the artist, and our supporters too much to let them down. The good thing is that I've published over eighty books and I know how to get them shipped and delivered, and I know how to manage a schedule and keep projects on track, and I will stay motivated and energized to get the books into your hands when I said I would.\n\nThanks to everyone has supported us.

I get to be an explorer, an inventor, a biologist. An adventurer. Through my years playing D&D, working for TSR, Wizards of the Coast, and then freelancing, I had the privilege of revealing wonders to people who share my love of the fantastic. I dissected dragons to see how they work. I found friends and companions\u2014from spacefarers in distant solar systems, to pirates and thieves and magicians, to a certain dark elf. Whole cultures, entire races, emerged into the light. Along the road I discovered a world of my own, which is still unveiling. Many of you have been with me every step of the way. Your appreciation of my efforts made it all possible.\nUPDATE: Thanks to the overwhelming support, the page count is now 336. Depending on how these last two days go, I may be able to push it to 352! That includes most of the paintings I've done plus some essential process and concept art.\nFound Worlds will be a record of our excavations together, a compilation of every world we\u2019ve uncovered. I want to put it all in this book, and that's why we're here. It\u2019s going to be big, and I want to share art and process for everything from the beginning of my career to all my finished paintings\u2014Dungeons & Dragons, Drizzt, Magic: The Gathering, Warcraft, The Evertide, and countless other realms. I'm asking for your help to make it happen. Are you ready to take another journey with me?\nIntroduction by artist and friend, John Avon, with commentary by Donato Giancola, Mark Nelson, Marie Brennan, R.A. Salvatore, and others.\nSample pages\nFound Worlds will be 9\"x12\", with over 290 pages of illustrations printed at the best quality modern printers can achieve. The time and finances it takes to make a book this size possible can skyrocket quickly, and you know I'm a perfectionist, but I want this to be a beautiful and lasting portfolio of my work. In the meantime, I'm halfway done with my second novel in The Evertide series, but illustration still pays the bills; Found Worlds may give me room to continue building this universe with story and art.\nBesides the book, I'm offering quite a few rewards as a thanks to backers. Some of these are brand new or expanded compilations of my art, while others are discounted or rarely-offered items. Take note below that we'll charge for shipping after the campaign and before the books ship next year. \n THREE 8.5\"x11\" Prints - printed on premium luster photo paper with an archival 8-color process.\n Sketchbook Vols. 1 & 2 - I've done so many black & white drawings and concept pieces over the course of my career that there's no room for all of them in one book, so I'll include them as sketchbooks instead. I'm still finalizing their contents, but one will likely feature my concept work for 3rd Edition D&D. The other will collect finished pen and ink illustrations. Between the two I\u2019ll also share additional process on some of my favorite paintings.\nNo dragons were harmed in the making of this book...\n The Special Edition - Found Worlds, but wrapped in a dragonskin textured leather and stamped with a silver foil title. Each of these books will come signed and numbered. Each edition of this book comes with a hand-drawn sketch, or Remarque, inside\u2014unique to that book.\nPLAY\n\nOur printer showcases the wonderful \u201cDragonskin\u201d leather I\u2019ve picked out for the Limited Edition slipcase and book cover. Dragons have scales in armored areas, but skin more like that of an elephant or rhino over most of their bodies. This was a perfect match. \n The Collector's Portfolio- These 13\"x19\" prints are usually convention-only. For the first time here online I'm offering collections at a reduced price. Choose from Drizzt, Dragons, Magic: the Gathering, Dungeons & Dragons, D&D Monster Manual Dragons, and the Lady Trent Collection.\n\nFor the wyrm that needs everything\n Limited Edition Metal Evertide Print* - Offered only through this Kickstarter as a thank you to my highest backers is this 20\"x20\" Metal print of the iconic Evertide statue. Signed & limited to a number determined by this Kickstarter.\n*The metal print will ship in a separate category from all other tiers.\nI've received the proofs for the metal print in the Dragon's Hoard tier, and they are gorgeous!\nPLAY\n\nOther Limited Edition Prints - I'm only offering the metal print through this Kickstarter, but most all of my paintings are available as limited edition prints through my website toddlockwood.com \nSHIPPING- I\u2019m going to charge for shipping AFTER the campaign when the books are ready to ship. Which means you'll likely receive a survey from our Kickstarter with an opportunity to enter your address and pay for shipping then. I'll keep everyone updated with reminders when that survey is open / emailed. I've done my best to estimate realistic shipping for different countries. Again, these are just estimates, and I've tried to design the rewards so that they will ship to your door easily in one container, all except for the Metal Evertide Print. For this, and thus for the Dragon's Hoard tier, we will have to charge shipping separately from the other tiers. I'm working with some European services to decrease these costs, but please be aware of the shipping before you pledge, and feel free to email or contact with any questions. See \"regular shipping\" for all other tiers besides Dragon's Hoard, below:\nRetailers\u2014If you want to purchase 5 or more books for your own storefront, please email me: todd@toddlockwood.com\nAdd-ons - If you would like to combine tiers or purchase multiple versions of a tier, you can increase your pledge to cover the total amount of them added together. After the campaign ends, we will reach out to anyone with extra funds pledged to survey them about the additional rewards they are interested in.\nThank you so much for taking the time to visit this campaign. Thank you for believing in what I love. Thank you for coming with me on this journey.\nThe best is yet to come!\n\u2014Todd Lockwood", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe've tried our best to talk with the printer in detail and hammer out a deadline for this book. Although I've done my best to estimate exactly when it would be at your door, I've had enough experience to know that there can always be unforeseen challenges. A blizzard may strike for a week, a dragon may burn my house down, or the economy could collapse into ruin taking everything we know with it in a nuclear apocalypse.

This then gives us a real headache when it comes to working out how to charge everything at once!\nYou probably have a limited number of sockets, which means that you are forced to charge different devices in different places around your house.\nIt can be chaos on your table\nSome cables are not compatible with your device\nApple tried to build a better charging platform before, but they failed, dramatically.\nSo, if you can\u2019t get a good charger from Apple, what do you do? Do a search for \u201call-in-one wireless charger\u201d and you will find quite a few out there. However, they all have similar problems, 1) they are not reliable, 2) they do not charge all of your devices and 3) they look cheap and plasticky.\nFor all those Apple family users, we decided to create the ultimate 4-in-1 wireless charger, the only charger you will need.\n\nMFi Certified 4-in-1 Wireless Charger for All Apple Devices & Qi Certification\nWe care about our Apple devices, just like you. \nIncorrectly charging your devices can cause long term damage to its battery life. This is why we designed our wireless chargers in a very specific way. The MFi & Qi certification means that all the electronics are designed and specifically tuned for apple devices. This ensures that you are charging in a safe manner, exactly the same as your Apple original charger.\nDrop and Charge\nCharging Has Never Been so EASY!\nAs the world's first chain-coil wireless charger, both the Air quad and the Air Trio have  high-power wireless charging transmitter chain-coils built within the deck zone, which means you can simply drop your Qi-supported device and it starts charging at up to 10W speed. Life is simple, never again do you need to go looking for the charging spot with a so-called wireless charger.\nYour Life is Free, Don't Be Limited by Devices\nCharge Your Apple Watch Any Way You Like\nLicensed by Apple, the Apple Watch charging module can either flip up or down with a simple click. This allows you to charge your Apple Watch safely horizontally, or vertically when you use it as a night clock.\n18W Super Fast Charging Port\nCharge your phone up to 50% within 30 minutes\nBoth support 18W fast charging and can charge your phone to up to 50% within 30 mins. Saving you time for the more important things in life instead of waiting for your device to be charged.\nCase Friendly Design\nDesigned with an adjustable controller, the lightning/type c terminal can be adjusted to fit your device charging no matter whether it wears a case on or not.\n\nTechnology Should Serve Human, LDR Design Ensures Your Nice Sleep \nWe know you may charge your devices in your bedroom as you go to sleep. With the LDR (light-dependent resistor) sensor, the light goes dark automatically when lights off, so that you can sleep peacefully.\nUsing Whilst Charging\nThe Air Quad is also equipped with a foldable stand, helping you to charge devices upright. So you can keep an eye on incoming messages, weather alerts, scores or what\u2019s playing on Spotify. You can also use it for hands-free FaceTime calls or for watching live videos on Facebook and Instagram.\nSpace-Saving Foldable Design\nWhen there is no need for you to charge the iPad or other devices on the terminal, you can always decide to fold it and save space.\nLiving Organized to Be Successful\nOrganize All Your Apple Devices with A Compact Design\nBeing the ultimate 4-in-1 wireless charging station, the Air Quad charges your iPhone, iPad, AirPods and Apple Watch in one small, simple place and keeps them neat and tidy. Say goodbye to messy cables. Never again will you need to look for your charging cables, now you can live organized.\nNever Settle for Average, We Always Go for Top-Tier Materials.\nBuilt with the premium material combo of aramid fiber & chrome-plated zinc. Both the Air Quad and the Air Trio are designed to be luxurious. The precisely cut aramid fiber face provides an unforgettable, luxurious and sexy smooth touch. The zinc alloy frame provides stability and a high degree of accuracy. Both materials are engineered to dissipate heat effectively whilst still giving that high-end appearance.\n\nCustomize your Air Quad /Air Trio, and make it really unique now.\nAvailable ONLY for Kickstarter, and limited 200pcs ONLY. (Out of stock)\nWith the laser engraving technology, now you can put a few texts on the product in the rear section, like your name or your mottos or anything you would like to say to your friends, etc. By engraving, you really make it unique and memorable.\nIf you want the customization service, please add $15/CAD20 when pledging. We will contact you for confirmation when the campaign is ending.\n\n Optional Silver or Black Color \nAir Quad/Trio comes with two different colors: black and silver. They are both enhanced with genuine aramid fiber and chrome-plated zinc, but the polishing process is a bit different. \nThe classic black version is polished by matte sand paint which offers a smooth texture. The silver version has an extremely dashing look because the entire back area is electroplated with bright chromium, which involves many times of polishing, reshaping and CMC. That means, more techniques and stricter design demand are required for the silver than the black version. \n\nHow to use Air Quad & Air Trio\nAir Quad & Air Trio Voltage Test:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdapters Available in CN, US, AU, EU, UK types.\n Note: Customization is out of stock", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is not our first time explore in the multi-device wireless charging field and we have a pretty good idea of what to expect and how to do things right.

You aren\u2019t likely to carry your grandma\u2019s super comfy quilt on a plane unless you want to look like you\u2019re headed for an adult sleepover. Blankets just aren\u2019t packable!\nYou never know if the plane you are boarding will get drafty, if you will be stuck on a super long layover, or if you'll end up in a window seat up against the cold wall of a bus. We thought there had to be a much better way.\nHere's The Solution: The Layover will change the way you look at travel blankets forever. We incorporated a ton of neat features to keep you comfortable on the go. Here's a quick walkthrough:\nSpace & weight of your luggage on the go is vital.\nDetachable & Hideaway Stuff Sack\nThe attached stuff sack packs into a zippered pocket on the side of the blanket to keep it out of the way when using the blanket.\nEasy Stuffing w/Patent Pending Stuff Sack\nStuffing into stuff sacks is the worst. To solve this, we added 3\u201d of extra material for easy grip & stuffing.\nYou can then use the drawstring to quickly cinch down and convert the material down to its most compact size.\nThe breathable insulation core keeps you feeling just right. Fun fact: Our insulation is 100% recycled PET plastic (i.e. water bottles) & keeps high performance standards.\nMicrofleece Kangaroo Pocket\nWe've lined the inside of the Kangaroo pocket with microfleece for a soft place for your hands.\nInside of the Kangaroo Pocket\nSnap Blankets Together & Increase Blanket Width\nWant a wider blanket size to share with a friend? Compatible snaps line the edge of the blanket to increase width to as many blankets as you want. \nDon't worry, we did the math. It only takes 386,376,478 of our connected blankets to make it to the moon.\nSpill Proof/Water Resistant\nSizing\nTech Specs\n Nylon: 20D\n Insulation: 40 gr/sq m made from PET plastic\n Warmth Rating:  60\u00b0\n Zipper: YKK\n Weight: 11.4 ounces\n Drawstring: Paracord\nAnti-Static + Waterproof Coating\n Machine Washable \nWashing Instructions\nThe blanket is machine washable. Tumble dry it on low or hang dry.\nWhen will it all ship?\nTimeline:\nOur Story\nChris met Lance in 2017 with an idea to design a better toiletry bag for traveling. \nHoly smokes - we\u2019ve shipped 37,000+ products to 108 countries around the world. Because of your incredible support we've been able to continue to design products that make traveling a little easier and better.\nWe have the raddest Kickstarter backers around - we\u2019re so thankful for the bestowed backer trust. We're busy designing a lineup of travel products that solve problems we and other travelers experience.\nLifetime Warranty\nWe are so confident in our product's build that we have added a lifetime warranty - plain and simple. If the blanket doesn't hold up for what it was designed for then let us know and we'll make it right.\nReturn Policy\nWe only used premium materials to ensure years of use. We will repair or replace any blankets that somehow don't hold up to do what the blanket was designed to be used for. We do not offer refunds or returns on blankets that were received as a Kickstarter reward.\nWe\u2019re passionate about creating amazing products and Kickstarter is a way for us to launch our brand. As you've read, Kickstarter isn't a store and rewards are a thanks for supporting the project which is why we cannot offer refunds or returns. Your pledge means so much and we take it very seriously. We will do anything we can to make sure that this exchange leaves with good vibes for everyone involved.\nOutside The USA? International Customs Calculator\nWe are so pumped that we have shipped this product to 108 countries. Backer rewards are merchandise and not gifts. We value your support SO much and want to make every interaction super positive all the way through this process. If you are backing our project outside the USA you will likely have to pay customs. \nShipping fees DO NOT count toward customs fees. Here is a shipping calculator for you to understand what you will be paying your government to import this product. \nhttps://www.simplyduty.com/import-calculator/\nNeed further help?

", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOur manufacturer is world class & extremely experienced. They make some of the world\u2019s most incredible products and even though we have everything in place, there's always a risk working building a new product.\n\nWe've made thousands of products and have hired a experienced manufacturing team to ensure quality and to keep us on our timeline. Our manufacturer will everything possible to make sure we delivered backer rewards promptly.\n\nWe put a lot of processes in place to reduce the chance of errors.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nLong-lasting design\nWe didn't cut any corners with material selection to ensure rips and tears are minimized plus stress points get extra attention. We also designed reinforcements in areas used most. Two examples:\n\n1. Snaps are reinforced with extra material surrounding them to reduce rips\n\n2. Attached stuff sacks can get stress on the connected parts when packing. We added a snap to the piece of material that connects the blanket to the stuff sack. When packing away if the material is getting too much stress, the snap will break loose vs cause threads to take the beating.\nReusability and recyclability\nWith our Lifetime Warranty, we want to make sure that the blanket, as do all our products, gets years of use. Instead of just throwing away a blanket for a warranty claim we want to closely examine and attempt to repair.\n\nIn 2018 we also used only minimal packaging. One cardboard box was designed to serve as packaging and the shipping box (vs a box shipped in a box). We also do not use single use plastic in any packaging. We opted to use tissue paper to protect the product inside.\nSustainable materials\nInsulation: 100% recycled material. Certified free of harmful chemicals and are safe for human use. Organic certification means that textile and fabric products are grown according to strict guidelines on the use of petroleum based fertilizers, pesticides and synthetic products.\nEnvironmentally friendly factories\nEven though with some factories it is a new concept to really reduce waste we are pushing them to be more conservative with waste. It's amazing how much plastic can be used just to ship thousands of products from a factory to a warehouse. We take steps along the way to reduce all waste.\nSustainable Distribution\nWe're very close (as friends and physically) to our fulfillment center. Waste when fulfilling thousands of orders at once also is pretty ridiculous. Giant plastic bags are a standard & used to gather all the products together to take to the distribution center. For this project we are going to work with our warehouse/distribution center to make sure this waste is minimized (hopefully to zero!).", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 99 or more", "title": "Early Bird: 1 Layover Blanket", "descp": "Get The Layover Travel Blanket for $31 off the retail price ($130).\nINCLUDES:\nThe Layover", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["3,223 backers", "Limited (2 left of 3225)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 120 or more", "title": "1 Layover Blanket", "descp": "Get The Layover Travel Blanket for $10 off the retail price ($130).\nINCLUDES:\nThe Layover", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["24 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 190 or more", "title": "Early Bird: 2 Layover Blankets", "descp": "Get TWO of The Layover Travel Blankets for $70 off the retail price ($260).\nINCLUDES:\n2\u00d7 The Layover", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["1,079 backers", "Limited (1 left of 1080)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 240 or more", "title": "2 Layover Blankets", "descp": "Get TWO of The Layover Travel Blankets for $20 off the retail price ($260).\nINCLUDES:\n2\u00d7 The Layover", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["9 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 280 or more", "title": "3 Layover Blankets", "descp": "Get THREE of The Layover Travel Blankets for $110 off the retail price ($390).\nINCLUDES:\n3\u00d7 The Layover", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["79 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 460 or more", "title": "5 Layover Blankets", "descp": "Get FIVE of The Layover Travel Blankets for $190 off the retail price ($650).\nWe can't wait to see you snap all five of these together :D\nINCLUDES:\n5\u00d7 The Layover", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["41 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 84 or more", "title": "SUPER Early Bird: 1 Layover Blanket", "descp": "Get The Layover Travel Blanket for $46 off the retail price ($130).\nINCLUDES:\nThe Layover", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["Reward no longer available", "300 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 168 or more", "title": "SUPER Early Bird: 2 Layover Blankets", "descp": "Get TWO of The Layover Travel Blankets for $92 off the retail price ($260).\nINCLUDES:\n2\u00d7 The Layover", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["Reward no longer available", "200 backers"]}], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #20", "update_userinfo": "Re:Pack // Keychain Face Mask IS LIVE ON KICKSTARTER!", "update_content": "Well hey there,\nSuper psyched to share a sneak peek of our upcoming Kickstarter project!

Poses For Artists Book Series, Volume 5 is happening! If you missed the Kickstarter, don't worry, you can purchase it today on our website PoseMuse.com. \nUPDATE! Stretch reward goal met. Poses for Artists Book Series Volume Five will now have 200 pose references instead of 120!\n\"Drawing believable - as well as interesting - human figures is very important to the work I create. Justin's \"PoseMuse\" material has proven to be an invaluable resource for both inspiration and literal reference. Highly recommended!\" ~Brad Thingvold - Comic Artist\nMy name is Justin Martin. I'm an author and an artist who wants to create the next book in my Poses for Artists series, 'Volume Five - Hands, Skulls, Pin-ups & Various Poses'. The book will include my latest pose resources, available on my pose-blog, PoseReference, that now has over 50,000 followers. Volume five primarily includes poses that have never been made available, along with a compilation of poses that I've put online for free over the past three years.\nThis Kickstarter is essentially an advance pre-sale for 'Poses For Artists Volume 5  . It will help cover the costs of publication, while giving perks and major book discounts that are only available in these Kickstarter rewards. This is my way of offering more to the artist community, and everyone who has supported this passion project over the past few years. \nThe cover, poses and publisher files for Volume Five are almost done, but I need your Kickstarter support to finalize everything and make the project happen. Your support helps  cover the cost of supplies, equipment, book design, publicity, pre-production, acquiring ISBNs, publisher/account fees, shipping, travel, website fees, fulfillment and book printing.\nVolume 5 Hand & Skulls Examples\nMy poses simplify the human form in a way that can sometimes remove the inevitable anxiety that comes with drawing a person, and speed-up your art, over time, increasing your own understanding of human anatomy, proportions and movement.\nMy intention is to share my simplified poses online and in print, so they might inspire everyone to pick up a pencil or stylus and create new art. I understand that sometimes, you just need a creative nudge to help get the pencil moving and break that pesky block. In my heart, I believe that helping to empower artists makes the world a better place. \nVolume 5 Example Poses - Based on photo references from SenshiStock\nTo give you an idea of what I've published in the past, see my previous books on my website PoseMuse.com (all available on Amazon and Gumroad).\nVolume 1 - Dynamic and Sitting Poses | Buy > |  \nVolume 2 - Standing Poses | Buy > |  \nVolume 3 - Fighting & Various Poses | Buy > |  \nVolume 4 - Couples Poses | Buy > |  \nYour support is your invitation to the community, and be an important part of making this next volume happen.

A concentrate of my last years of work.\n  The reason I love monsters and creeps is that they're fun. I've spent the last 30 years with Aliens of all kind around me when I wasn't directly working on them. Not even mentioning the creepy cover art and daily work I design for my fellow colleagues, writers or publishers like Titan Comics, Upper Deck Entertainment, Big Dog Ink...\nThe  reason why I did not add ladies as you can see in the print option, is  that I want to have something special added. Who knows how well all  goes, and I can add prints, trading cards or a limited extra Artbook with only ladies involved!\n  \"Aliens, Heroes and Other Creeps\" is a 48 pages, full color A4 artbook, my very first in that format. Coming with 130gr/m\u00b2 pages with a matte finish, it's printed in France, which professionalism is a given!\n  It  will hold my 2018 work on Aliens, proposals for Blade Runner , Wonder Woman and more in all its beauty and even a cover here and there! \nThe Sisterhood Exclusive Print\nThe author.\nKevin Enhart is born in Belle-Ile en Mer, France. He began writing and drawing as a kid and, as a teen, got awarded for a few short stories, and wins three comic book contests. After studying History of Art and Cinema in High School at Rennes, he writes or directs some few short films.\nIn 2010, he officially becomes a professional illustrator and comic book artist, before colouring some various titles.\nFrom 2013, he\u2019s an illustrator for Upper Deck Entertainment, a comic book colourist and a storyboarder and concept artist for film. He co-writes and provides the art for a web-comics called \u201cThe Heindrich Project\u201d, before writing a one shot that would eventually got published by Hound Comics.\nIn 2015, Kevin joins Titan Comics for colouring various series, from Puss in Boots to Vikings or Warhammer 40.000. He also writes a chronicle about comics and cinema in French cinema magazine l\u2019Ecran Fantastique, and teaches cinema in a high school.\nToday, he works as storyboarder for commercials, and keeps working on comics, while preparing his first professional short film.\nHis first creator own series, \u201cThe Outlaws\u201d is going to be released this year from Markosia.\nHe lives near Paris with his wife Carine, an art teacher, and their two kids.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nSome few risks.

Mutant Mayhem Minis WILL be a reality thanks to all of our early backers. From this point on, we are advancing towards unlocking lots of cool free stuff and new options for all our backers! Scroll down to the Stretch Goals section to see what's coming next...\n The upper tier rewards offer a great deal on per figure cost, that just gets better with each new Free Reward Unlocked. Currently:\nComplete Character Set: 21 figures for $80 = $3.80 per figure\nGM Bad Guy Set: 25 figures for $90 = $3.60 per figure\nGet It All: $40 figures for $160 =$4 per figure\n*All the Mut-O-Rats combined count as just 1 figure for the above calculations.\nThe Story Behind Mutant Mayhem Minis\nThe goal of this kickstarter is to raise funds for mold-making and production costs to create a line of figures specifically for the Mutant Crawl Classics playing game (and of course, also great for any old-school post-apocalyptic game, Gamma World, etc.). If you are awesome enough to give us money to make it happen, the pewter figures themselves will be your reward!\nTo get things started I sculpted 15 detailed player-character pieces, including an array of Pure Strain Humans, Mutants and Manimals. I also created a few different monster pieces, and these figures were used by my wife and myself for the Mutant Crawl Classics games we ran at Gen Con this year. All of the sculpts have already been mastered, and enough pewter castings run to make production molds. We\u2019re partway there already, we just need your help to afford production molds and a pile of metal to get these guys out into the world. And hopefully, this will just be the beginning\u2026we plan to add tons more characters, adversaries, and even terrain bits to the line down the road!\nFor those who haven\u2019t been seen it yet, Mutant Crawl Classics is a role-playing Game of Post-Apocalyptic adventure published by Goodman Games and compatible with the Dungeon Crawl Classics Fantasy game. Humans work alongside mutants and mutated sentient plants and animals to survive a radioactive world of dangers and horrors, and uncover the mysteries of the world that came before. Learn more here. \nA Free Adventure Module\nAt all Reward Levels, all backers are entitled to download our FREE 22-page adventure The Goats Of Travail! This adventure features miniatures already unlocked during the campaign --spider-goats! 4 downloadable full-color battle-maps are also included! It's available right now --if you are already a backer, head on over to Update #18 for download instructions! If you're not a backer yet, as soon as you make that happen, then head over to Update #18 to get your free module!!\nThe Heroes\nBelow are pictures and a brief description of all 15 characters in the initial line. Note that as an added bonus, all pledges will receive access to a free PDF file, with character sheets and backgrounds for all the characters. These are the exact same stats we ran at Gen Con\u2014balanced, playable, and fun!\n  BAM-BEE\nDeer Manimal. Insect-like antenna combine with radar-dish antlers to provide exceptional sensory abilities. \n  BAT GUY\nMutant (mutated human). Recovered an ancient artifact, a \u2018Graphic Novel\u2019, and uses it as an instructional manual for Life. He now considers himself the Wasteland\u2019s Crime Fighter.\n  BELLE\nCow Manimal. Always brings milk and cheese for everyone. Just\u2026don\u2019t ask where she got it.\n  BOB-DAR, The Bob-arian\nPure Strain Human (Sentinel). Wielder of the legendary \u2018Shield of Yield\u2019.\n  CAP\u2019N PLATYPUS\nMutant (mutated human). Quills of a porcupine, bill of a duck, mane of a lion. Heart of a hero.\n  DHAR-RYL\nPure Strain Human Scout. Super-capable redneck with a heart of gold. And a crossbow.\n  DOK-TOR ZAY-ISS\nOrangutan Manimal. Stretchy. Calls himself an \u2018Orangu-twang\u2019. Thinks he\u2019s a genius. If true, he is operating on a whole other level.\n  FLOWER\nPure Strain Human Shaman. The bark-like skin on her limbs marks her as a follower of Gaea, the AI god of Nature, if the plants and flowers growing in her hair weren\u2019t enough of a clue.\n  GUT-FACE.\nMutant (mutated human). Ewww, his mouth is in his belly. But he\u2019s got a cool scorpion-like tail that acts as an extra hand, so that\u2019s cool.\n  HAROLD\nCactus Plantient. A little go-getter. His extra limbs make him extra-fast and extra-stabby.\n  LAHR-REE\nPure Strain Human Shaman. Lahr-Ree is a follower of HALE-E, the AI of video games and pop culture. He doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense in day-to-day conversations, but he can call upon amazing powers in times of need.\n  MISTUR TODE\nToad Manimal. His ability to mesmerize enemies makes him truly formidable. Those who prove resistant to his charms simply get whacked on the melon.\n  PIERCE\nPure Strain Human Healer. Her little mutated friend Brane the Rat might actually have the medical degree, but, if not much of a healer, Pierce sure knows how to hurt people.\n  PLISS-KIN\nMutant (mutated human). His imposing size gives him extra strength, making his stop-sign greataxe even more devastating. Oh, and he shoots lasers from his eyes.\n  TRIBELLA\nMutant (mutated human). Don\u2019t get on her bad side when she\u2019s having a Bad Hair Day.\nA Word about the Gen Con Adventures\nWe ran two different adventures at Gen Con: The Gaea Protocol, and The Temple of ZIhA. They were very well received, and we certainly hope to publish these as 3rd party official MCC adventures. We thought about actually making the modules part of this Kickstarter, but have decided to work on them separately. Minis are what I know, and I know I can get these guys turned around quick for you all. Getting the modules to a polished and shiny state might take a bit more work and is really more of an unknown factor for us. The good news is, when we do get the modules ready, all these miniatures will already be done and waiting for them.\nAdd-ons: The Bad Guys\nI also sculpted a bunch of bad guys for the games, and they\u2019re pretty cool, too! Since they are bad guys, I figured some folks might not need \u2018em at all, and some folks might want multiple copies of some or all of them. Therefore, I have made them available as Add-Ons to the main Pledge Levels. If you want some, simply add up the numbers from the costs below and add that total on to your pledge amount.\nP\u2019lutians\n  These \u2018creatures\u2019 may look like some sort of magical swamp monster, but they are actually more akin to robots. An advanced Gaea Node in the center of each uses tractor beam and force field technology to draw pollution to itself, where it can then be ambulated back to a processing facility for purification. At least, that\u2019s how it was supposed to work. Now, their programming has become corrupted, and they spread pollution and death across the land. \nZihans\n  A race of little mutant iguana-manimals. These guys are none too bright and are generally hostile to other sentients. Recently, they have discovered some ancient \u2018monster movies\u2019 that have led to them displaying some truly odd behavior. They walk with exaggerated stomping motions, like they think they\u2019re really big, and they carry bottles of Inferno Ant Extract, which they chug and then spit at their enemies, making it look like they are breathing fire. Also, they\u2019re little nudists.\nGihans\n  These mutated Gila Monster Manimals have been seen in the company of the Zihans lately, and they may have been watching some of the same movies. They are much bigger than the zihans, and also a little smarter and a lot crueler. \nCult of ZIhA Minions Set\n  This set contains 8 Zihans and 2 Gihans, and is enough minions to run the Temple of ZIhA adventure when we do finally get around to publishing it. Even if you just wanna use them in your own adventures, these are the type of Minion monsters that you\u2019re likely to want in multiples.\nCult of ZIhA Lieutenants\n  The final boss monsters of the Temple of ZIhA, available as a set or individually, and detailed below.\nBob-Ziha\n  A giant extra-mutated Gihan. Bob-Ziha is no genius, but he\u2019s big. Like, real big. His fans among the tribe have dressed him up in special armor so he looks even more like their monster-movie idol. This is a large model that stands on a 2\u201d circular base and is cast in 6 different pieces. \nGig-Ann\n  This female Gihan is a cosplay fanatic, and borrowed props from the movie theater to make her look.\nGlow Dan\n  Dan is heavily mutated from a base Gihan manimal, possessing wings, a beak, and glow-in-the-dark skin. \nAngry Russ\n  Russ is a mutated Zihan with a spiky carapace. His friends noticed he looked a bit like one of the monsters from their movies, and to help further the impression they painted him brown. The brown paint irritates his skin. Thus he is angry. Angry Russ.\nAdd-Ons Cost chart\nBe sure to check back as the Kickstarter progresses\u2026Stretch goals that are met will also become available as Add-Ons.\nStretch Goals\nIf we meet our minimum funding goal, we\u2019ll start throwing free stuff on the pile to entice new backers to jump on board, and to entice all of you to find those new backers and direct them over here. \nWe want very much to give you all great value for your pledges, but it is also important to deliver on time, and not slow the project down. To that end, I\u2019m going to be sculpting like a madman DURING the ks project, and trying to finish the sculpts for the new goals before they are announced. We\u2019re also going to throw in a few goals that are minis I\u2019ve sculpted previously that fit in great with the post-apocalyptic theme. \n The three types of Stretch Goals\nFree Reward: This is something that will be added FREE to your rewards, IF you\u2019ve pledged at the appropriate level. Realistically, I can\u2019t give out lots of free stuff to backers who pledge at all the lower levels\u2026I\u2019ll lose my shirt. Therefore, Free Rewards are only available to backers who pledge at the levels of Complete Character Set, GM\u2019s Bad Guy Set, Get It All, or your own MCC Mini (either one).\nThe exception to this is that if you pledge at a lower level and also throw enough Add-Ons into your pledge to meet or exceed the $80 value, then I will also throw you the free stuff.\nAdd-On: These are new minis that will be added to the Mutant Mayhem line, but that I can\u2019t afford to give out for free. These will be available to all backers to purchase as Add-Ons if we meet the stretch goal.\nOption: This Stretch goal unlocks a new variant or pose for a mini currently in the line-up. You will be able to select either option as your reward (if you are at a reward level that gets the mini) when you fill out your Backer Survey after the kickstarter. You will also have the option of purchasing the new pose as an Add-On, so you get both (or all) varieties.\nBig Spender Alert\nIf you really love our stuff and want to spend as much as two people would, then golly, we really love you too, and want to reward you as much as two people! So if you pledge $240 or more, you will receive DOUBLE the Stretch Goal Free Rewards. If you pledge $320 or more, you will get TRIPLE the Stretch Goal Free Rewards.\nTHE GOALS\nHere\u2019s a few of the first goodies we\u2019ve got lined up: \n  We\u2019ll start things out by adding some FREE minis to your pile that are already available, but nonetheless very cool and appropriate to the post-apocalypse setting. These pieces were called Spawn Rats in my Tentacles & Eyeballs line, but come slinking up here as Mut-o Rats \u2013regular vermin that have been exposed to some bizarre mutagenic compound, and changed into something even grosser! Since we have reached $4,000, all pledges at the $80 level and above will get a full set added to your rewards for FREE: 3 tiny Mut-o rats, one larger Ankle-Biter Mut-o Rat, and one Den Mother Mut-o Rat.  Stats for these beasties will also be added to the Character PDF. \n  Originally marketed as Spawn Fiend Mutants in my Tentacles & Eyeballs line, these guys are a perfect fit for MCC as poor souls who got exposed to some mutagenic toxic waste. Now that we've passed $5,500, each pledge at the $80 level and above will receive a set of all 3 figures as a FREE REWARD! They also come with pewter \u2018mutation sprues\u2019 that allow you to assemble them in many different ways. Mutant Crawl Classics-compatible stats for these guys will also be added to the Character PDF. \n  The Plantivore is a powerful mutated monster that gains its sustenance from consuming other sentient plant life \u2013plantients!! A nightmare for all plant-based player-characters, the Plantivore is now added as a Free Reward for all pledges $80 and up! As always, we will also include a Mutant Crawl Classics compatible stat-block and write-up in the Character PDF as well.\nWhat started as a way to create spider-silk more rapidly through the magic of genetic engineering has gone horribly horribly wrong with the addition of rampant radiation...behold the SPIDER-GOAT! Does whatever a Spider-Goat can! Including adding himself as a FREE REWARD to all pledges $80 and over, and adding himself as a $6.00 Add-On option to all pledges now that we have hit the $9,000 mark. The picture is a high-quality 3D print Erica painted up for us...he doesn't exist in pewter yet, but now he soon will!\nAnother monster from the MCC Bestiary, the Caprapod Warder is actually some strange sort of colony creature that has a kind of symbiotic relationship with Spider-Goats, and basically acts as a Spider-Goat Shepherd. As we have now reached $9,500, the Caprapod Warder Mini is unlocked as a $7 Add-On available to all pledge levels. The SPIDER-GOAT ENCOUNTER PACK is also unlocked!  This Add-On is a convenient way to get 5 more Spider-Goats --all the Spider-Goats you would need to run a challenging encounter, plus the Warder, all for only $28.\nSo our $9,500 Stretch Goal, the Caprapod Warder, is even weirder than most MCC baddies. If it takes too much damage, its body fragments and splits into a bunch of little 'Sap Pod' monsters --and that's what these are! At $10,000, these 6 cute little Sap Pod critters unlock. Each one sits on a \"Tiny\" sized 1/2 base. Get all 6 of them as a $4 Add-On, or get them all as a FREE REWARD with the purchase of a SPIDER-GOAT ENCOUNTER PACK!\nSo we made it all the way to $9,500 and unlocked those stretch goals, then got knocked back down a bit as a few big backers had to leave for real-life reasons. Since that put our next stretch goal a bit farther away, I thought I'd give us some extra incentive to get there.\nWhen we reach $10,000, not only will the Warder Sap Pods unlock, but all Backers at $80 and above will now get a SECOND SPIDER-GOAT added to their rewards for FREE!\nHere's another reward right from the MCC Bestiary...the CROACHLING! Of course mutant cockroaches infest the radioactive wastelands!! They will also infest your rewards...that is, if we can make it to $10,500. When we meet this stretch goal, all backers pledging $80 and above will receive a croachling mini as a FREE REWARD, and he will also be available to all backers as a $5 Add-On. (Picture is a digital rendering of the 3d model...real-world version coming soon!) This croachling's name is Tom, and he shows that even in the post-apocalypse, being a cockroach is still 'Risky Business'.\nSo, here's the thing about Croachlings...there's never gonna be just one. And that includes in your Rewards! If we make it to $11,000, a second pose of this fun monster will be added as a FREE REWARD to all pledges $80+, and will be available as an Add-On for $5. This guy's name is Earl.\nHot on the heels of Earl is Joy, our 3rd Croachling pose. This cockroach gal is ready to join the swarm --and your rewards--if we reach $11,500. She will then be added to all pledges of $80+ as a FREE REWARD, and be available to buy as an Add-On for $5.\nRounding out the croachlings is the fearsome Croach Commander! This boss monster towers over his minions, standing over 30% taller. If we reach $12,000, there will be two ways for all backers to get him. The first is as an a $7 Add-On, easy-peasy. The second is as part of the CROACHLING ENCOUNTER PACK, which also unlocks at the same time.\nThe Croachling Encounter Pack is a pile of croachlings --everything a gm needs to run a challenging encounter. For $28 Add-On, it includes 6 croachlings (2 of each pose) and the Croach Commander. Got a big group? Super-Size it --add 3 more croachlings for just $40 total.\nThe Platco(TM) Security Bot version 1 is one of Platco's most popular models. Highly customizable, it features numerous hard-points to which different gear can easily be attached for different tasks, and is an ideal combination of durability and affordability.  This model, the 1-A, is fitted for Crowd Management, and features high-decibel speakers, flashing light, and easy-to read 'Emoji Screen' that clearly conveys the robot's current operating parameters. When you think Security, think Platco(TM)!\nAt $13,000, the Platco Security Bot can be yours for the low low price of a $7 Add-On. Of course, if you pledge $80 or more, it will be yours for the super-low low price of FREE!\nAt $14k, we unlock a HUGE Add-On --the Yvox! He's a multi-piece model kit, featuring a resin body and pewter wings, legs, tail and face bits. \nD&D has the Bullette, Gamma World Has the Sep, and Kevin Bacon had the Graboids. Now, at $16,000, we welcome to MCC...the UNDER-BITER! I'm really excited about this one: a mutated shark that telekinetically burrows through earth and even concrete to attack unsuspecting PCs anywhere! When we reach this stretch goal, all backers who have pledged $80 or more will get this cool medium-sized (on a 1\" base) Under-Biter for FREE! All backers can also order as many as they like as an $8 Add-On. \nHey! What's this?? Even more stuff unlocks at $16k! Medium land-sharks are cool, but no one is REALLY afraid of a shark unless it is bigger than they are. Enter these 2 ginormous Add-Ons. These large-sized Giant-Underbiters each sit on a 2-inch base, and definitely look like they could swallow a PC whole!\nMORE TO COME\u2026.!!!\nShipping\nShipping is complicated, and I\u2019ve seen way too many Kickstarters get in trouble by not charging enough for it, over-charging for it, communicating it badly, etc. I\u2019m gonna try to make it as simple and painless as possible, therefore.\nShipping will be extra\u2014it is not included with the pledge amounts (all that would really mean is jacking up the pledge values enough so that I think I\u2019ll have enough to cover it). When your order is put together and ready to ship, we will send you an email with the shipping cost, with a link to pay by Paypal. \nIf you would like an estimate on shipping, the weight chart below shows the expected shipping weights of some of the pledge levels at this time (this may change if we unlock a lot of stretch goals\u2026I will try to update these numbers as I am able). You can use the USPS Shipping Calculator to get an idea of the shipment cost from our shipping location (Michigan, ZIP 48183) to your location. Think of this as a ball-park number\u2026I may have to add a bit for packaging material and labor (probably about a dollar) Optionally, you can feel free to message us with your expected pledge and location, and we can provide you with a personalized estimate.\nShipping will be by USPS First Class Package delivery or Priority Mail, whichever is more economical. International orders are welcome, and delivery will be by First Class International Package or Priority Mail International, whichever is more economical.\nWe will be prioritizing keeping shipping costs down in our packaging over \u2018Out-of-Box Experience\u2019. If we can fit all the figures safely in a Small Flat Rate box, we\u2019d rather do that than put everything in a great big box that has individual little pretty boxes for all the figures.\nI know paying for the shipping separately can be a bit of a hassle, but I think it\u2019s the best way to make sure you get your rewards and pay the absolute least amount possible.\nSHIPPING WEIGHTS BY PLEDGE*\n   *Estimates only\u2026actual weight may vary according to Add-Ons and figures selected, and by Stretch Goals included. \nDelivery Times\n20-odd production molds, a pile of casting, and lots of packing and shipping\u2026I estimate I\u2019ll have about a solid month\u2019s worth of work to do to conclude this project, maybe a bit more. Just to give myself some wiggle room, I\u2019m setting the estimated delivery as 4 months from the end of the Kickstarter. I will post weekly updates to keep everyone informed of progress, or any impediments to progress that may arise. \nWho is Dark-Platypus?\nAndrew Barlow\nDark-Platypus Studio is mostly and mainly me, Andrew Barlow. I\u2019m an illustrator, sculptor, game designer, writer, all around creative guy. I\u2019ve been running Dark-Platypus for over a decade now (I lose track of the years), making gaming tokens, life counters, miniatures and artwork. I make molds and do casting for a variety of small game companies, including Microworld, Hydra Miniatures, Firelock Games and others.\nErica Barlow\nMy lovely wife Erica helps out tons around here. She\u2019s a veteran gamer who writes and runs fantastic adventures, she has just as much gaming experience as I do, but unlike me, can also remember stuff, which I think makes her experience actually count a lot more. She also knows her way around a paint brush, and painted most of the pieces photographed here, with only minor touch-ups added by myself.\nAndrew Oswell\nA great friend and a great DM, Andrew is on board to help facilitate all the various logistics involved in running the Kickstarter. Actually born a gamer, I think, Andrew has superior skills in a lot of useful areas. He\u2019s an excellent writer, great at logistics and management, knows tons about game rules (and how to abuse them) and is a master dm. Also, he thinks he\u2019s Batman (he\u2019s not\u2026I\u2019M BATMAN, but we let him dream). You may see Andrew pop up in the comments as he helps me stay communicative here\u2026for future reference and to avoid confusion, HE is Andrew, while I am Andy (that\u2019s how we do it in our own gaming group, and it works pretty well).\nGerald Gentry, Chris Klann\nMy flunky/friends who I have been training in aspects of my work. They can at least usually manage to pour metal without burning themselves. Both work as Security Guards in real life, and are gamers whenever they aren\u2019t doing that. Gerry has vast knowledge of all classic rock and musicians in general, and is a fantastic resource in any trivia challenge. Chris has encyclopedic knowledge of all things Dinosaur and all things Pokemon, which comes in useful\u2026whenever that kind of knowledge is required.\nF.A.Q.\nThis will be added to as people begin to Ask some Questions Frequently.\nCan you do a Painted Set pledge level?\nSadly, neither Erica nor I will have time to paint sets of figures for rewards. The only way we could make this work is by hiring a painting service to do it, and then adding the cost of the service into the pledge amount. We\u2019d be making no money from that (unless we marked it up), so it wouldn\u2019t be helping the project to move forward. I recommend contacting a painting service directly. If you like, you can contact me before shipping and I will drop-ship your rewards to the painting service of your choice for you.\nMutant Crawl Classics and MCC RPG are trademarks of Goodman Games.

Whether you are a casual fan or a rabid one, we've got you covered. \nI loved Lovecraft even before I knew his name. His lore permeated every inch of my childhood. I didn't know, for instance, that H. P. Lovecraft was the mind behind the Necronomicon when I watched Evil Dead. I didn't know he was the grandfather of psychological horror as I binged In the Mouth of Madness, Jacob's Ladder, Aliens, and dozens of other terrifying movies in my youth. \nI didn't even know Lovecraft created Cthulhu until well after I called the Great Old One's name. However, the older I got, the more I grew to appreciate the warped mind behind some of my all-time favorite things, and I wanted to create something that could show that love, with people who loved Lovecraft as much as I did, for people who loved Lovecraft as much as me.\nAnd Cthulhu is Hard to Spell is the result of that process.\nAfter the success of my first anthology, Monsters and Other Scary S^&t, I asked my fans, and fans of the book, what we should cover next, and they told me Lovecraft. \nImmediately, I was like \"YESSSSS!!!!\" \nMonsters and Other Scary S^&t was all about how monsters can represent anything from cute to scary and everything in between, and Cthulhu is Hard to Spell is just like that, but with Lovecraft. It's 35 stories that show just how deeply Lovecraft has permeated the  essence of our culture. \nWhen I create a book, the first thing I sit down to figure out is how my book can be different from everything else on the market. After all, there are HUNDREDS of Lovecraft anthologies out there, both from Lovecraft himself and from loads of authors who have carried the torch for him in the last century. \nAdditionally, there are tons of stories told from a Lovecraftian horror point of view, dealing with the creepy, unsettling nature of humanity. I didn't think we could compete with those, nor did I want to, either. \nThere is one thing I love, though, that I haven't seen a lot previously...a book devoted to the mythology of Lovecraft's universe. \nYou see, I've always been fascinated by the gods and monsters of Lovecraft, and I never seemed to get enough of them in the stories I read. Most Lovecraft stories are filled with the horror aspect of Lovecraft, but low on the mythology. \nBut my favorite part of Lovecraft is the mythology he crafted, the gods he made, and the way that mythology differed from the myths of every other mythology out there. So that's what I set out to create.\nCthulhu is Hard to Spell is a book steeped in the mythology and gods of Lovecraft. The stories inside it's pages follow the spirit of Lovecraft, but often strays from the tone of Lovecraftian horror. \nSure, some of the stories in this book are Lovecraftian in nature down to their very core, but there are also funny stories, cute stories, fantasy stories, sci-fi stories, and much, much more which build on the Lovecraftian mythos. \nIf you love the gods and monsters of Lovecraft, then Cthulhu is Hard to Spell is going to be your jam. \nBest of all, this anthology is ALL AGES APPROPRIATE. These aren't stories made for children necessarily, at least not all of them, but we toned down the cursing (there is none), the violence (there is no blood), and there was never any sex, to make sure you could show it to your child, even if they won't understand it all. \nI've had conversations with many people at shows asking for a book to indoctrinate their children, grandchildren, nieces, nephews, cousins, etc, into loving creepy things, and I think this book is a great primer for that, while being enjoyable to people who already love the creepy, too. \nWe listened to you from the last anthology, and made sure this was: \n-Appropriate for all ages (even though we deal with some very dark topics) \n-Full color\n-Shorter stories (2, 4, 6, or 8 pages) \n-All stories are even numbers, so they begin and end on the same page throughout. \nWe used your feedback to make this anthology even better! You opinions are very important to us, and we appreciate them very much. \nBackers really loved our first anthology\nThe real reason we're doing a second anthology is because Kickstarter backers and fans loved our first anthology so much. I was hesitant to do a second anthology before the Monsters and Other Scary S^&t campaign launched. \nHowever, the response from backers was so positive that I gladly decided to go into the fray a second time. There is nothing like geeking out about something with creators and fans, and that is what our anthologies allow us to do.\nCheck out the reaction to our last anthology. We hope this anthology has an even better reaction! \nWe brought back a bunch of creators from the first book and added a ton of new faces so we can make this book even more amazing! \nWhy do the other creators love Lovecraft so much? \nWe all have our reasons for loving Lovecraft, so listen to some of our creators talk about why they got involved in the project. \nWho am I? \n My name is Russell Nohelty, publisher of Wannabe Press, a small press that creates weird books for weird people, creator of Katrina Hates Dead S%&t, Ichabod Jones: Monster Hunter, and Pixie Dust, along with the editor of both the Monsters and other Scary S^&t, and this anthology.  \nI have raised over $70,000 on Kickstarter from 7 different projects, and have gotten exceedingly good at crafting amazing books which audiences love. My previous two projects, Monsters and Other Scary S^&t and Pixie Dust, both raised north of $25,000 from over 600 backers each. \nI have a simple motto when it comes to Kickstarter. I outlay all the money to get the book print ready, and then I bring it to my audience and ask if they would rather have a cheaply made paperback edition, or a beautiful hard cover edition. \nSee, I can go hit enable distribution on a soft cover edition right now, but luckily Kickstarter backers have again and again wanted the hardcover edition, printed in the most beautiful way possible.\nWhat are some of the stories in this book? \nNora (art and words by Angela Oddling) -- a dejected teenager living in an ice village sets out to find Aphoom-Zhah and thaw his cold heart. \nThe Dunwich Boys (art by Esther Pimentel, words by Eddy Hedington, letters by Nikki Powers) -- Yog-Sothoth has materialized in a house in Dunwich, and the Dunwich boys have to banish it from their neighborhood. \nThe Eternal War (art and words by Eric Young) -- A retelling of the origin story of Lovecraft's universe, translated from the Voynich manuscript. \nCat is Cryptic (art and words by Megan Hutchison) -- a retelling of the Cats of Ulthar, one of Lovecraft's most beloved stories. \nTsathoggua's Triumph (art by John Edingfield II, words by Clay Adams) -- Tsathoggua dreams of his eventual conquest of the universe. \nCleaning the Mess (story and art by Brandon Perlow, words by Paul J. Mendoza, Letters by Wilson Ramos, Jr.) -- Cthulhu has conquered another world, but all he really wants is his master to come find him. \nSong for the Harbinger (art by Brianna Gilmartin, words by Heather Kenealy) -- Ghroth doesn't understand why nobody likes his singing, all he wants to do is harmonize with planets, and they keep blowing up. \nThe Yag-Kosha Mystery (art and words by Kelly Dochy) -- Yag-Kosha, the pacifist alien, has a mysterious koan for you. \nMons (art and words by Matthew Childers) --Explorers on Mars find an ancient tome that could unlock the secrets of the universe, or unleash a Lovecraftian horror. \nThe Summoning of Brkthruslpk (art by Robin Dassen, words by Don Perkins) -- A group of kids works to summon the ancient god Brkthruslpk onto the world. \nNo DQ (art and words by Ryan Fisher) -- A weak, sickly wrestling fan gets to live out his fantasy of being a star after a mysterious stranger endowing him with an enchanted garment. \nSlumber (art by Lloyd Ladera, words by Sarah Anderson) -- After being woken up on a spaceship, a man has to escape the Lovecraftian horror chasing him. \nThat's Cthulhu to You (art by Zac Skellington, words by Leo Baxter Kiker) -- An oddities store gets a new pet: Cthulhu. \nHow to Summon the Dark Lord Hastur (Art by Cara Stemo, words by Johnny C, letters by Travis Duda, logo design by Nathan Burns) -- A card game, a tragic birth, a goverment experiment, and a violent crime all converge to release a deadly horror on the world. \nChurch of Mormo (art by Claire Leslie, words by N.S. Kane) -- Greek spirit Mormo goes door to door trying to recruit Cthulhu worshipers to her cause. \nShe Came Upon a Great Tree (art by Nick Kremenek, words by Mike Speakman, edited by Greg Smith) -- A delivery driver and part-time cultist must find a great tree to unleash Cthulhu and Hastur onto the world. \nFlycatcher (art by Dan Scalisi, words by Frank Martin) -- Even though they have been warned for years, the fly people of Dipterra are not prepared for the wrath of Yba'sokug. \nThe Rally (art and words by Mary Bellamy) -- Lucifer needs new generals, and has decided to recruit Lovecraftian gods to his cause. \nWhy is this book going to be so awesome? \n1. It's 176 pages of glorious comics! - That's a massive amount of awesome comics about monsters! Over 150 pages and 35 stories!\n2. It's gonna be in hardcover! - There are lots of comics, but how many are printed in hardcover? Not many! \n3. All the UV spotting! There's gonna be spot UV all over the cover. I love spot UV and I've gotten exceedingly good at using it over the years. There might even be a little surprise if we can blow past our regular goal on that front. \n4. Glossy art paper - Most books are printed in gloss lamination, trapping all the glorious line work under an ugly, gross, yellow film. This anthology is different. It's printed on glossy art paper, which means the ink shines on top of the paper and looks like it's simmering, just like the any other art book on the market today. After all, we believe that comics are beautiful works of art and should be printed as such. \n5. Our creators have credits from all your favorites companies. Our creators have worked with Marvel, DC, Oni, Tokyopop, Heavy Metal, Fantagraphics, Upper Deck, Sony, and more along with brands like Teen Titans, My Little Pony, Invader Zim, Ghostbusters, Horizon Zero Dawn, and more. We have creators who have been nominated for Eisners, won Glyphs, Silver Eagles, WGA awards, and more! \n6. There are just so many many Lovecraftian gods and monsters. There was only one rule in this anthology; all of the stories needed to contain at least one Lovecraftian god or monster. This book is full of different types gods you know like Cthulhu and Azathoth, and ones you've never heard of as well! \nAnd you can get the whole book, including shipping, plus a pdf copy AND audio commentary for just $40, INCLUDING SHIPPING (in the US, at least)! \nWho drew that dope cover? \n It was drawn by Aaron Alexovich, creator of my favorite indie comic of all time, Serenity Rose, a 500+ page graphic novel about a previously famous witch trying to come to terms with her powers in a very weird town. Read it. Buy it. Love it.   \nIf you've never read that book, you probably know him from his work on Invader Zim, both the television show and more recently on the comic book. \nAaron is a powerhouse in the world of indie books, and Zim is one of my favorite animated shows of all time. He also drew the cover for the Monsters and Other Scary S^&t anthology. I really wanted him to come back for this anthology too, and I was so stoked when he said yes!  \nOn top of it all, Aaron might be one of the few people on earth that loves Lovecraft, especially Cthulhu, even more than me, which I once didn't think possible.\nDid Dirk Manning really write the foreword? \nYes, Dirk Manning, an icon of Lovecraftian horror comics on Kickstarter, wrote the foreword for Cthulhu is Hard to Spell. He didn't have time to contribute, but he asked me if he could do the foreword, and I of course said yes. \nDirk has raised a ton of money for Nightmare World, Tales of Mr. Rhee, and more on Kickstarter, and that he wanted to contribute to this book means the world to me. \nHere is a snippet of what he wrote, which made me smile. \nFor now, take the time to enjoy this book.\nWhile it\u2019s (another) unspoken truth that anthologies are often a hit-and-miss prospect, I can honestly say that there wasn\u2019t a story in this collection that I didn\u2019t enjoy... which shouldn\u2019t be surprising since it\u2019s a reminder that just like you\u2019re not alone in what you know and feel, these stories reminded me I\u2019m not alone either.\nI was honored when I read those words. So yes, file under: Dirk Approved. \nWhat are some other stories in the book? \nAshes to Ashes (art by Laura Neubert, words by Virginia Drohan) --  Quachil Uttaus learns what it means to be human.     \nOne Last Chance (art by Ben Herrera, words by K.J. Kaminski, colors by Emmanuel Torres) -- Humanity has one last chance to save the universe as they fight against the forces of Zathog on the planet Zarr. \nA 10,000 Year Curse (art by Dave Lentz, words by Dave Lentz and Ryan Kroboth, Inks by Rob Simmons, Colors by Ryan Kroboth) -- Even the old gods needs a night off, but it's often impossible to find a reliable babysitter, even for them. \nThe Call of Stone (art and words by Shannon Kirkwood) -- After a woman dies, she finds her true purpose in protecting the Star Mother. \nLove Story (art and words by Christie Shinn) -- A love story about Mnomquah and Oorn's eternal love. \nBasatan vs. Satan (art by Lady Beaver, Words by Steve Waldinger, letters by T. Perran Mitchell) -- Basatan returns to the surface to take his rightful place as ruler of Earth, but Satan has other plans.\nThe Art of Losing (art and words by Nathan Leuth) -- After her family dies and the Apocalypse comes, a young woman finds strength in music. \nSunset at Sarnath (art by Wesley Wong, words by Wesley Sun) -- An old man, a young girl, and a pig discuss who was responsible for the end of the world. \nThe Marriage Counselor (art by Melissa J Massey, words by Madeleine Holly-Rosing) -- Mnomquah and Oorn go to marriage counseling, because even the best marriages fall apart sometimes. \nWhere is the money going? \nGreat question. Here is a pie chart of the distribution of the funds. This is subject to fluctuation based on pledges, but should be a good guide. \nBook production and printing - $9,000 (41.5%)\nShipping - $6,000 (27.7%)\nPins - $334 (1.5%)\nKickstarter fees - $2,166 (10%)\nCreator residuals - $2,166 (10%)\nEmergency - $2,000 (9.3%)\nYou may ask why I have such a high emergency fund, and I would respond that it is why I have been able to successfully deliver 7 campaigns, because stuff always goes wrong, and sometimes in a big way. \nWhat can you get for your pledge? \nI am not the kind of creator who offers a ton of different rewards, but I do want to offer some awesome ones. Here's what you can get for your money. \nBefore I move on, I want to point out a couple of our coolest rewards. First, I want to thank Andrew Pawley for making this awesome paper doll, which EVERYBODY who pledges even for $1 will receive! \nYou have to build it yourself, but it looks just so awesome when it's set up.\nSecond, for the first time ever, I am doing an exclusive PIN designed by Aaron Alexovich specifically for this campaign. I have this pin in hand already, and it is AMAZING. \nAlso, we'll be offering our variant white eye addition of the Monster anthology, instead of the normal yellow eye edition. I only had a couple hundred of these white eye variant Soulless eye editions made, and they are almost gone! \nThe Crush it on Kickstarter course is my introductory course about how to run a Kickstarter campaign. It will show new creators (or ones who want to up their game), how to create, launch, fund, and distribute their campaigns. As a person who has run eight campaigns and successfully filled all but this one (only because it's currently running) without going over budget, and having raised almost $100,000 on Kickstarter, I know a thing or two about this stuff. \nMore importantly, I am a seasoned course creator through my website, The Complete Creative. If you would like to see the course, you can do so by clicking here. \nMy How to Make an Awesome Comics Anthology course is one I made specifically for this Kickstarter. After my previous anthology campaign, people asked me a ton of questions about how to make a comics anthology, but I was too overwhelmed to answer them. This time, I wanted to be prepared, so I laid out my exact strategy for making an awesome comics anthology. \nI'm very proud of this course and think that whether you are a seasoned pro at anthologies or just starting out, you can learn a ton from this course. I take you all the way from finding your theme through running your Kickstarter campaign. \nPlus, if you buy this course you ALSO get my Crush it On Kickstarter course absolutely free. You can check out the course by clicking here.\nWho are the rest of the creators? \nThe Eyes of Yba'Sokug (art by Jonathan Howard, words by Michael R. Martin) -- a poem about the end of the world, which feels eerily relevant in our current times. \nThe Believer (art by Claudio Sanchez Viveros, words by Christian Douglas) -- A Nyarlathotep cultist pontificates over the horribleness of man as he speaks to his daughter. \nRise (art and words by Bradley Sheridan) -- Hastur is frustrated that his minions cannot overtake a town run by a godzilla monster. \nThe Calling (art by Katrina Kunstmann, words by Caleb Thusat) -- An adventurer fights his way through a dungeon in order to take on a Lovecraftian god. \nThe Last Convention (art by Lea Seidman, words by Anne Toole) -- The world is over, and everyone has to choose how they are going to die by going to the last convention and being pitched by different cultists or the various Lovecraft gods. \nThe Crossroads (art by Silvio DB, words by Terrance Grace) -- Lovecraft writes a letter to his ex-wife as he slowly goes mad. \nThe MC (art by Nic Touris, words by Jack Holder, letters by Micah Myers) -- An agent to Lovecraftian gods has to deal with his unruly clients as he tries to get them work. \nAzathoth's Slumber (art by Erik Lervold, words by Russell Nohelty, additional colors by Vlaire Donaghue) -- The outer gods have been playing music to keep Azathoth asleep for millions of years and they are sick of it. \nSneak preview of one of the stories! \nTake a look at one of the stories from the book! This is a story that I created and wrote with my good friend Erik Lervold. We are reprising our team-up from the Monsters and Other Scary S^&t anthology! \nDid you dig it? If you did, then it's time to pledge. \nStill on the fence? No worries. Click here to get a 50+ page preview. \nI hope you believe this is going to be an amazing anthology. If so, pledge to the campaign and make this happen! ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhile I have been able to deliver seven projects, there have been complications with some. I feel as though I have fixed all of those issues at this point with my supply chain, but there are always some more that pop up. \n\nFor instance, with the monster anthology, we had to wait an additional 3 months for the glow-in-the-dark eyes to be applied correctly, and fix errors in the covers. \n\nWith Katrina, we had to wait 8 more weeks in port due to customs than we wanted, delaying our release from July until September. \n\nThese things can and do happen, and I can't say they won't happen again. However, I have done everything possible to ensure that we will have a smooth operation and these books will be in your hand as soon as possible.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Paper toy!", "descp": "Get a downloadable Cthulhu paper toy designed by Andrew Pawley from Galaxafreaks and Cthulhu Kids!\nINCLUDES:\nPaper toy", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2018"}], "stat": ["51 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "Digital Lovecraft", "descp": "Get a digital copy of the anthology in .pdf and .cbz form!\nINCLUDES:\nDigital Lovecraft\nPaper toy", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2018"}], "stat": ["348 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 20 or more", "title": "Audio Commentary", "descp": "Get audio commentary of my thought process about each story, why I placed it in the book, and fun stories about the book's creation.\nINCLUDES:\nDigital Lovecraft\nPaper toy\nAudio Commentary", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2018"}], "stat": ["22 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 40 or more", "title": "Hardcover edition of the book!", "descp": "**NO ADDITIONAL DOMESTIC SHIPPING CHARGES!**\nGet a physical copy of the book in all its hardcover glory!\nINCLUDES:\nDigital Lovecraft\nPaper toy\nHardcover copy of the book\nAudio Commentary", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jan 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["358 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 50 or more", "title": "Special Thanks", "descp": "**NO ADDITIONAL DOMESTIC SHIPPING CHARGES!**\nSpecial thanks in the book!

Please back us!\nThe Al Rio Tribute Art Book Volume Three!\nThis book covers art from the year 2008.\nThis is Terry Maltos. I was Al Rio's business partner and friend for 10 years. He died unexpectedly in 2012 and left us with hundreds of amazing pieces of fantasy art, character art, model sheets, commissions, comic book cover art and sexy pinups to enjoy, appreciate and learn from.\nThis Kickstarter campaign is to raise money to publish Volume Three in a series of books I'm producing to make a historical record of Al Rio's incredible artwork.\nVolume One covered the years 2003 - 2005\nthen...\nVolume 2 covered the years 2006 - 2007\nNow?\nThere's enough artwork, so 2008 will get a book of it's own!\n\u00c1lvaro Ara\u00fajo Louren\u00e7o do Rio \"Al Rio\" was born May 19, 1962, and died January 31, 2012. Volume One of this series contains a nice Biography written by Jerry Whitworth. He was a great man with a beautiful family. \nHe worked with many publishers on many different titles and publishers including Marvel, DC, Wildstorm, Image, Dark Horse, Chaos Comics, Zenescope, and Crossgen.\n\nThis is a REAL BOOK you can hold in your hands! \nHardcover - 80 pages.

It's mostly the shipping and cost of production. Last time, these books were over 3 pounds with packaging and sometimes International orders cost more to ship than the book itself! Since Kickstarter counts the amount collected for shipping in the total, the amount we need to raise is much more (this is a mistake I made in the past which cost me lots of $$).\nAlso, these are amazing full-color, hardcover books. If you participated in my previous Kickstarters you know the books are high quality! Plus the Kickstarter fees, the PayPal fees, design by the incredible Mark McNabb, promotion, packing/shipping materials, taxes, bonus goodies and official licensing from Al Rio's family, who was kind enough to let me make this book to help document Al Rio's life's work.\nPayment Note! If you can't pay through Kickstarter - pre-pay me directly with PayPal, Venmo or however you're used to paying.

They own a gentleman's club called \"Naughty Faeries\", where they work undercover as hired assassins, honing their skills in preparation to take down a demon warlord, who is looking to destroy all the purity and innocence in the universe, through both time and space.\nA Grimdark Fantasy where the assassins are the antihero, or are they?\nIt is for mature audiences.

She is the only one able to train the orphaned dragon that is in the family's care.\nMaeven Brigde\nLiam Brigde is the middle child, and only son. He has struggled with his powers since a battle with Balor, a demon god, responsible for his parents death. Liam was left severely wounded with damaged wings. His confidence and powers have suffered ever since. He is able to control and manipulate time,as well as control protective powers. He no longer is able to fly, however his wings still maintain his regenerative powers.\nLiam Brigde\nAislynn Brigde is the youngest of the family. She is sassy, smart and not afraid to speak her mind. She is rebellious and fearless with a fierce determination for revenge. She has not been able to master her powers. Although her wings are huge, she is unable to fly. However, she is able to change all matter through a partial vapor spell. Her wings have the ability to change colors with her moods and emotions, often leaving her frustrated because everyone knows whats she's feeling and she can't hide it.\nAislynn Brigde\nLittle one is the pint sized baby dragon, who is in training under Maeven. Working besides Maeven, he is learning how to use his powers of teleportation and flight.

It pays for the artists, printers, stretch goals, shipping materials/shipping, as well as taxes and fees. Kickstarter allows Comic Art Groupie to get books directly into your hands without having to hunt for them. They get directly shipped to the backer with potential goodies (by exceeding the funding goal - through stretch goals), not being offered any place else except to you the backer. This platform allows creators to thank you, the backer, for your support. It is a great way to get what you want, directly from the independent publisher and creators.

A few covers are being finished up at the start of the Kickstarter but will be completed by the time the Kickstarter ends. It is ready to go to the printer as soon as it is funded, reducing waiting time for backers. After backing many projects, I have learned that it is important to have everything done and ready before the launch. \n\nAll the rewards have been created and the artwork is uploaded. The goal is 2 weeks after the project is funded, and the money is transferred, the project is sent to the printers. Within 6 weeks, the books and rewards will be shipped. \n\nIf unforeseen issues arise, you, the backers will be the first notified. Without you, this project could not be successful.

Over 1600 rough images and 400 finals will make this book the most complete study of dynamic female action poses ever!\nThe book will be divided into 6 sections:\n1. Hero Poses - 70% of the book! Heroic poses that strike fear into the hearts of enemies!\n2. Sitting/Crouching Poses - If you have trouble drawing foreshortened legs and over-lapping limbs this section is for you!\n3. Flying/Jumping Poses - Raul draws almost every conceivable flying pose/angle you could ever want to draw.\n4. Dynamic Standing Poses - Poses that express action, attitude, swagger and emotion.\n5. Contortion - a small section dedicated to the study of the female body's maximum range of motion. This section will help you learn just how far the human body can realistically bend and twist before it breaks!\n6. Body Types - another small section showing various female body types other than young athletic bodies.\nReady to Use Roughs!\nAll 1600 rough images have been designed from the ground up to be used as a foundation for final images. There are no \"awkward\" or \"useless\" rough poses - every rough you see in the book will be good enough to build into an awesome final image!\neBook Reward\nThere is only 1 eBook reward - all 4 books will be shipped to your home via USB stick. eBooks are DRM-free and can be used on any device (desktop or mobile).\nALL EBOOKS MUST BE SHIPPED TO A PHYSICAL ADDRESS.\nThere are no download links. eBooks are only available within Canada, US, Europe, UK, Australia and New Zealand.

They talk about the process, tips, tricks and art in general.\nReal World Assignments\nWe challenge our artists with assignments that reflect their real world workloads. Our videos focus on large projects like animated feature films or graphic novels. We want to provide you with something close to \u201con the job training\u201d. The images below were designed by Dane Romley for an animated series titled \"The Invincible Sherlock & Watson\". The entire cast took months to get \"right\". That's the kind of quality that goes into our videos!\n Good Isn't Good Enough!\nWhen our artists give us good designs - we push them to make them great! Take a look at the Dane Romley\u2019s design below for Moriary. His beautiful crocodile design in tailored white suit is great took a great deal of effort to get right. But, even with all the hard work and many revisions, we still felt it was too tame. We pushed Dane to reach deep inside his brain to create something more sinister, more evil and more importantly, more unique.\n   Express Yourself!\nEach one of the Design & Expressions tutorials covers the drawing of over 20 facial expressions. Five facial expressions are drawn for each of the 4 main characters!\n We Focus On Exploration!\nCreating fresh designs is hard work - a lot of sketching and dooling goes into the process before even a rough design is created. Sadly most tutorials today skip over this crucial part - all the messy work is done off-camera, before filming, so that the video looks clean, polished and easy to follow. Unfortuantely, this method discourages students who can\u2019t replicate the results in the video as flawlessly. Gone are all the mistakes, dead-ends and redoes that lead up to the first rough draft. The problem is that these early doodles and sketches are the most creative part of the process. Our videos focus on the most creative parts of the process - so you can watch and learn the most important part!\nTo ensure you\u2019re seeing the most creative part of the process we make the artists do all their sketching and doodling on video. Whenever the artist is drawing a new design you can see sure that absolutely no sketching was done off-screen. Take a look at some of the exploration Oscar J. Vargas did on his title character Edward Crow for his tutorial - an animated television show \u201cThe Crow\u2019s Nest\u201d.\n     ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe expect Female Action Poses to be completed and shipping by July 2018 with ebooks going out the same month.

This was when print was king before digital advertising and the internet. These ads were ads I paid for to run in the Creative Illustration Book 1992 and 93. I have kept stored the printed handout of these ads for 24 years. I used these print ads as handouts and mailers. The Creative Illustration book came out of Los Angeles and was the book to advertise in.

I am most notably known for my work in illustration having done a string of classic computer game covers in the 1980's and 90's. You may have seen some of the covers I painted which included Might and Magic Clouds of Xeen and Darkside of Xeen and interior maps, Wing Commander, Solstice, WolfChild and Power Blade to name a few.\nRecently, my work recieved worldwide attention after I self published my book Classic Game Covers about my experiences being an artist. It is a honest and humorous read about the creative process and history behind the cover art I painted. I made the ebook available for free and the response it got was overwhelming. It was written up on websites all over the world and read in over eighty countries.\nMight and Magic, Wing Commander covers\nHere are a few of the responses my ebook received.\n\"Mike Winterbauer is the artist behind some of the most fondly remembered retro box art from gaming's golden age, including covers for classic titles such as Might & Magic, Wing Commander and Spaceward Ho!. Okay, maybe that last one doesn't count. If you ever wanted to know the process behind those classic video game covers, you can download a free .pdf from Winterbauer's website in which the man himself tells us how he did it\nMostly, it involved lots of heroic posing in his underwear. Winterbauer couldn't afford to hire models, so he had to get his friends to photograph him in the pose he wanted to draw. Enough childish giggling, though, the fact is that his work rate, particularly in the early 1990's, was astonishing.\"\nhttp://www.gamewatcher.com/news/2014-21-07-find-out-how-classic-video-game-box-art-was-created\nLand of Xeen map\n\"Veteran game artist Mike Winterbauer is a crazy person. He\u2019s written a book showcasing (and telling the story behind) some classic examples of PC and console cover art, and instead of charging a premium for it, is giving it away for free.\nOK, so it\u2019s not exactly to the design standard we expect from publishers like Titan (he published it himself), but the art and processes we get to see here are just the best.\"\nhttp://www.kotaku.com.au/2014/07/how-awesome-old-box-art-was-made/\nWolfchild, Power Blade and Solstice covers\n\"Artist Michael Winterbauer has self-published a free book with stories about his life in the game cover art business.....You can download the complete \"Confessions of an Art Junkie\" here (90 megabyte PDF). Pages 26-28 on Wing Commander are below. Retro also published an interview with Michael recently.

I am most notably known for my work in illustration having done a string of classic computer game covers in the 1980's and 90's. You may have seen some of the covers I painted which included Might and Magic Clouds of Xeen and Darkside of Xeen and interior maps, Wing Commander, Solstice, WolfChild and Power Blade to name a few.\nRecently, my work recieved worldwide attention after I self published my book Classic Game Covers about my experiences being an artist. It is a honest and humorous read about the creative process and history behind the cover art I painted. I made the ebook available for free and the response it got was overwhelming. It was written up on websites all over the world and read in over eighty countries.\nMight and Magic, Wing Commander covers\nHere are a few of the responses my ebook recieved.\n\"Mike Winterbauer is the artist behind some of the most fondly remembered retro box art from gaming's golden age, including covers for classic titles such as Might & Magic, Wing Commander and Spaceward Ho!. Okay, maybe that last one doesn't count. If you ever wanted to know the process behind those classic video game covers, you can download a free .pdf from Winterbauer's website in which the man himself tells us how he did it\nMostly, it involved lots of heroic posing in his underwear. Winterbauer couldn't afford to hire models, so he had to get his friends to photograph him in the pose he wanted to draw. Enough childish giggling, though, the fact is that his work rate, particularly in the early 1990's, was astonishing.\"\nhttp://www.gamewatcher.com/news/2014-21-07-find-out-how-classic-video-game-box-art-was-created\nLand of Xeen map\n\"Veteran game artist Mike Winterbauer is a crazy person.

This special update is about production design and this one is about the 40k stretch goal.\n \u2018Visions of a Thousand Eyes\u2019 is the most ambitious collection of contemporary fantasy art that you could ever dream of, set in a beautiful 184+ pages artbook. To display this unique gem under the best possible light, the artbook will be printed as limited hardcover deluxe edition, exclusive to Kickstarter.\nSince 2015, the Instagram community of Eclosion has been sharing thousands of epic fantasy art illustrations from all corners of the world. The iconic online community is growing fast and now comprises more than 125,000 highly active fantasy art fans.\nFollowing a popular request from the community, over the past months our team has set itself the herculean task of securing the participation of 43 world renowned fantasy art illustrators. We are passionate about their art and just can\u2019t get enough!\n\u2018Visions of a Thousand Eyes\u2019 will include exclusive insights about each artist\u2019s background, inspirations and advices. These extraordinarily talented men and women have been working as freelancers, owners of creative studios, concept artists, senior artists and/or art directors for some of the biggest entertainment companies in games, video games (Assassin's Creed, The Elder Scrolls, The Witcher, etc.) or cinema. Also, some of their most famous fantasy illustrations have been used for GRR Martin, Patrick Rothfuss, Robin Hobb, Terry Pratchett or Frank Herbert book covers (to name just a few).\nThe above non-exhaustive list of brands are registered trademarks and \u2018Visions of a Thousand Eyes\u2019 is not affiliated with them in any way. Mentions of these brands are only meant to share with backers the range of other works managed by the illustrators of this project.\nContracts with the artists are signed. The best possible collection of contemporary fantasy art has been assembled. Printing and shipping partners are in the starting blocks. All we need now is your support to bring this unique Kickstarter exclusive project to life!\nPlease note that this artbook is a limited edition exclusive to Kickstarter. Remaining stock will be marginal and only available through conventions or special promotions. You will never find 'Visions of a Thousand Eyes' on Amazon.\nHere are the three products that can be backed in addition of the artbook:\nThe 8 prints available will be 22cm x 27cm and the paper quality will be 300gr gloss coated with a little white mount. The Prints Set will be included in the artbook through a folder embedded in the 3rd cover. \nThe Portfolio is a beautiful personalized box with three parts and double lower part that enhances the packaging of the prints. The box will be the same size as the artbook and will include the 44 deluxe prints with a custom ribbon to consult them with delicacy. The cover of the box will feature one of the artists\u2019 illustration with the mention \u201cVisions of a Thousand Eyes - Premium Prints Compendium\u201d.\nThe premium prints included in the Prints Set and Portfolio will simply be perfect for framing, to enlighten your home or office. They\u2019ll be gorgeous pieces of art.\nYou will be able to buy these elements as add-ons in the BackerKit survey system.\nWe have put together a great choice of rewards (called 'Levels' because we are geeks) designed to fit any budget from $1 to $249.\nSupport the project at Levels 7, 9 or 10 to finally become immortal and have your name printed in the artbook in the 'Patrons of the Fantasy Art' page (very limited quantity!)\nStretch goals are simple and straightforward, to make sure that we deliver on time the most premium product to all backers, with the highest level of financial reward for the artists possible. 40% of the book price will be directly redistributed to the digital painters.\nAll stretch goals have been unlocked thanks to your enthousiam!\nFor the 40K\u20ac ($41.766) stretch goal, please have a look at this special update to know more about the \"Faithful Knights of a Thousand Eyes\" free expansion!\nIn addition, everytime you share the project on Twitter or Facebook (or any social media), feel free to use the hashtag #EclosionFantasy in order to spread the word about the project.\n  We are supported by iamag.co, the premium source of inspiration for digital artists and host of Master Classes + Art & Talk special events.\nThe best fantasy communities are also supporting the project: I Love Fantasy Art, Empire of Future, Fantasy Journal, Art Series, Paintings Wow, Art Galleries, Tigrische Art, Mythical Creatures Art and Samurai Concept.\n  Worldwide shipping!\nShipping will be charged after the Kickstarter ends through a pledge manager system. USA/Canada $13 to most states, Europe $15 to most countries and the rest of the world $22 are rough estimates for shipping a standard book package (4lbs). These are just estimates, and costs may rise based on weight increases from unlocked stretch goals and any optional buys you choose.\nPlease note that we will be using a fulfillment software named BackerKit after the Kickstarter campaign for the surveys, add-ons and shipping.\n  Those are some iIllustrations featured in the artbook\n   ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe core content (illustrations, artists biographies, etc.) is almost fully edited and ready to print.

Head over to FantasyArtWorkshop.com and sign up for Jeff Miracola's email newsletter so you will be informed when the Oil Painting Techniques video becomes available for pre-order.\nIf you want to purchase Jeff Miracola's Acrylic Painting Techniques DVD or Digital Download, you can buy that now at Three Points Publishing.\nUPDATES!\nBonus Video Stretch Goal UNLOCKED! (See Stretch Goals section below)\nFREE \"Faun\" art print for physical reward backers!\nWe have removed the \"Faun\" 5\"x7\" art print as a stretch goal and have instead decided to give this exclusive art print to every backer of a physical reward for FREE as a way of saying thanks for backing our project. This means you will have an art print that no one else will be able to get :-)\n A Little Background Info\nJeff Miracola has been working in the fantasy art industry for more than 23 years, most notably on Dungeons & Dragons and Magic: the Gathering. A few years ago, he and his videographer wife created a YouTube channel to share videos of his drawing and painting techniques. The channel has since grown to nearly 30,000 subscribers and more than 1.3 million views.  The short videos on his channel have proven popular, but Jeff and Silvia sensed a growing thirst for more in-depth instruction. So, in 2015, they created a Kickstarter for the creation of Jeff Miracola's Fantasy Art Workshop Acrylic Painting Techniques Video. Our wonderful backers turned out and made it a great success.\nAnd now it's time to do it again - this time for the creation of an Oil Painting DVD/Digital Download.\nJeff's first set of serious paints were oil paints, which he purchased as a high school sophomore. He's since been painting in oils: decades of experimenting, making mistakes (and learning from them), and perfecting his oil painting techniques. With this new Oil Painting DVD, he will finally be able to share all of his knowledge with you.\nWe hope you will consider backing this project. Thank you!\nJust a few of the many videos found on Jeff's YouTube channel:\n   VERY IMPORTANT: Jeff has not yet created the artwork that will be featured in this oil painting techniques video. The oil painting you see on the DVD mockup above (Tiger warrior) is only used to show you an example of what the packaging will look like. This is not the final image. \nOur planned delivery date for this Oil Painting DVD and all other rewards is April 2017.\nThe content of this video will benefit beginners to professionals at any stage of their careers. Our goal is to not only give you the most detailed look at Jeff's oil painting process but also to answer your many questions about creating an oil painting from start to finish. Jeff will focus heavily on creating a professional fantasy painting for a paying client. This video won't just cover the \"how;\" it will also cover the \"why.\"\nHere are some of the topics and techniques that will be demonstrated in this video:\nBrainstorming/Conceptualization \nAnatomy (Creature and Human) \nUsing and Creating Reference Photos\nDrawing from the Imagination\nTools for Sketching (Types and Use)\nThumbnail Sketching\nComposition\nFinal Sketch\nColor Roughs\nColor Theory\nPainting Surfaces (Preparation, Materials, and Tools)\nTransferring the Final Drawing to its Painting Surface\nPlanning the Stages of Painting\nWork Area\nLighting\nPalettes (Types and Use)\nPaints (Types and Use)\nBrushes (Types and Use)\nKnives (Types and Use)\nEasels (types and Use)\nSolvents (Types and Use)\nOils (Types and Use)\nMediums (Types and Use)\nCreating a Colored Ground\nUnderpainting (Process and Purpose)\nGlazing and Scumbling\nWet-on-Wet or Alla Prima\nDry Brushing\nImpasto\nControlling Edges\nUnderstanding the Fat over Lean Rule\nWorking with a Limited Color Palette\nMixing and Blending Colors\nPainting Problematic Subjects (Glass, Metal, Skin Tones)\nPainting Effects (Splatters, Textures, etc.)\nCleaning Brushes and Other Tools\nVarnish (Types and Use)\nVarnishing The Final Painting\nGeneral Safety (Tools and Materials)\nThis Oil Painting video will be packed with a lot of information. It will follow the same format as the Acrylic Painting video we created last year, i.e., a 4-disc DVD set. The Main Feature will be split between the first two DVDs. The other two DVDs will contain Extras featuring more detailed information and demonstrations of any techniques not demonstrated in the Main Feature.\nTechnical Specs for the Oil Painting DVDs:\nNumber of Discs: 4\nFormat: NTSC\nLanguage: English\nRegions: All Regions\nAspect Ratio: 16:9\nAge Range: 14 and up\nClosed Captioning: Yes\nTechnical Specs for the Oil Painting Digital Downloads:\nResolution: 1920x1080\nFormat: MP4\nLanguage: English\n  Let's be clear, this current Kickstarter campaign is not to raise money for an Acrylic Painting DVD. We already ran a successful Kickstarter campaign for the Acrylic Painting DVD last year. But for those of you who are just learning about our Fantasy Art Workshop series, here's your chance to get the Acrylic Painting Techniques DVD or Digital Download at lower than retail prices while also supporting and receiving the upcoming Oil Painting DVD.\nThis four-disc DVD set, with over 6.5 hours of content, gives you the most detailed look at Jeff Miracola\u2019s acrylic painting process and will answer your many questions about creating a fantasy art acrylic painting from start to finish. The focus of the video is on creating a professional fantasy painting.\nDiscs 1 and 2 contain the Main Feature (3hrs, 19mins), where Jeff takes you along as he creates a forest angel painting from the thumbnail sketch stage to the final painting.\nDiscs 3 and 4 (3hrs, 17mins) contain this Extras content:\n20 Questions with Jeff (Jeff answers many common and not-so common questions about acrylic painting techniques and more.)\nAdditional Acrylic Painting Techniques (Jeff shows various techniques that are not featured on disc one content.)\nStudio Walkthrough (Jeff gives you a tour of his painting studio.)\nBuilding an Art Portfolio (Jeff gives you advice on how to build your art portfolio.)\nPainting a Dragon Demo Video (Never before seen video of Jeff painting a dragon)\nColor Mixing Exercise\nOuttakes and Bloopers (You all know Jeff can never say his lines correctly the first time, but it\u2019s always fun seeing him try.)\nYou can view more information about the Acrylic Painting Techniques video, including a full chapter list, here.\n  Something Wicked Volume 2 will be a collection of six signed 5\"x7\" monstrously illustrated, full-color art prints in a folded portfolio by Jeff Miracola.\nRight now, Jeff has sketches completed for all six prints. The final art will be fully painted in oils. The original oil paintings are also available as rewards for you to own (See THE REWARDS section below).\nEvery backer of a physical reward will receive this portfolio for FREE. \"Digital Download Only\" backers will not receive the Something Wicked Volume 2 Portfolio.\nHere's a short one minute snippet of me working on one of the Something Wicked - Volume 2 oil paintings:\nPLAY\n\nThe Something Wicked Volume 1 portfolio is available as an Add-On in this campaign (See ADD-ONS section below).\n  Once our Kickstarter campaign reaches the following stretch goals, backers will be rewarded with FREE STUFF!\nThe Kickstarter campaign has reached it's stretch goal. That means that every backer will now receive a bonus video with additional oil painting demos or other videos I decide to create. It will be filled with all new content never before seen :-)\nPhysical reward backers will receive the bonus video content in the form of a DVD, as well as a hi-definition digital download.\nDigital Download Only backers will receive the bonus video in the form of a hi-definition digital download.\nIn addition to the Rewards, you can also increase your Pledge to purchase the following Add-ons.\nTo include Add-ons in your Pledge, simply select the Reward Level that you desire and then manually increase your Pledge by the cost of your selected Add-ons. You will be able to select your Add-ons after the project ends when we send out the Backer Surveys via Backerkit.\n  Read some of the praise for Fantasy Art Workshop's Acrylic Painting Techniques. As of the launch of this Kickstarter, the DVD has 37 FIVE-STAR REVIEWS on Amazon:\nImagineFX Magazine gives our Acrylic Painting Techniques DVD their highest honor: a five star rating and artist's choice award!\n\u201cJeff Miracola\u2019s epic-length video provides as comprehensive an overview of acrylics as you could wish for. It\u2019s ideal if you fancy dabbling with physical artwork after working digitally for a while, or are new to making art.\u201d - ImagineFX Magazine\n\"Serving up a comprehensive master class taught by an inspiring and knowledgeable teacher, this is highly recommended.\u201d - Video Librarian\n\u201cJeff Miracola\u2019s Fantasy Art Workshop: Acrylic Painting Techniques is an absolute must-have for both hobbyist and aspiring professional acrylic painters! Highly recommended.\u201d - Midwest Book Review\n\"You explained everything in such great detail, it's like you anticipated every question I might have had about every aspect of your painting process. I mean your tutorials on YouTube are really good, but this is absolutely phenomenal. Great production, loved the quick tips and the inspirational quotes. This dvd set would be a bargain at triple the price. Thanks so much for letting us share your insights and talent.\" - Darren H. (Artist)\n\u201cThis goes above and beyond his YouTube channel and completely changes how I\u2019ve thought about painting.\u201d - Cory DeVore (Artist)\n\"The DVD is well produced; this has great information for a beginner and experienced illustrator as well. Interesting to see Jeff's Technique. I really enjoyed the DVD and would definitely recommend to my art friends.\" - angelcomic (Amazon Review)\n\"This is a video I will go back and watch again and again, and recommend to anyone interested in acrylic painting.\" - Mike Hoekstra (Artist)\n\"Astoundingly good instruction. Thorough, high quality, and entertaining, this is an amazing resource for anyone wanting to get into painting.

The new securing clips we are designing and manufacturing for the first time should also be manageable. We have the CAD designs finished and 3D printed samples. We will need to develop steel molds for mass production. This should only take a few weeks to accomplish, then we would want to test the quality of injection molded pieces. We may need to make a few changes or change plastic material, but again, the securing clips are not a very challenging part of the project.\n\nOur first campaign was successful and we delivered our Zubits closures to more than 7,300 backers. The manufacturing took a couple extra months to complete, but a quality product was delivered and almost all Zubits backers were very satisfied.\n\nWe do not perceive significant challenges to delivering this product, but even if we do have major challenges, our existing Zubits closure inventory and formerly used clips could be used to satisfy backers.

Think Curious George with superpowers. If you enjoy Pixar movies like the Incredibles then you will like THUNDER MONKEY. The downside of having exploding skin is constantly having everything blowing up in your face! THUNDER MONKEY lives in Summercity with his adopted family. Doc Phazer - the worrisome and distracted scientist who discovered THUNDER MONKEY, Addison - his trouble seeking daughter and Widget, the robot make up the family cast. The story hops right into an adventure featuring a young THUNDER MONKEY. Events are set into motion that will haunt THUNDER MONKEY'S future. One of THUNDER MONKEY'S unfavorable abilities is to create powerful enemies. Who is the mysterious super villain lurking in the shadows?\nCover THUNDER MONKEY THE YOUNG YEARS #1\n   Thunder Monkey The Young Years #1 page 1\n\n  Thunder Monkey The Young Years #1 Page 2\n     THUNDER MONKEY Facebook page\nThunder Monkey The Young Years #1 Page 3\n   Thunder Monkey The Young Years #1 Page 4\n   Thunder Monkey The Young Years #1 Page 5\nTHUNDER MONKEY has been my baby since high-school. He appeared as a bootleg comic that I printed myself, came along as a college newspaper strip at the Savannah College of Art and Design and has appeared in published comics.  \nWHY KICKSTARTER?\nPublishing comics involves many hurdles. Unless tens of thousands of people order your unknown book from the get go, it will not survive. Kickstarter, however, only requires hundreds of backers instead of tens of thousands. In essence and here's the beauty of it that I love, you - the backer - become the publisher! The people decide themselves to help make a project come to life. You, like the big publishers give me the green light by pre-ordering. And just like a publisher your job is also to help spread the word. I only have one voice, but together the sky is the limit.\nSHARE\nMy goal is for every backer to share the link to this Kickstarter on their Facebook and or Twitter. If you can do more, then you my friend are awesome! Don't hesitate to reach out to me, I'd be happy to have you on my team. That's what it's really about, building a community of people who want to see THUNDER MONKEY. Go to the THUNDER MONKEY Facebook page and share.\nGOAL\nWhy is the goal so low? I am the writer and the artist, so production costs aren't as high. I'm not going to lose money because the rewards are built to cover the costs associated with each reward. I have quotes from $2.17 per book to $3.00 per book based on how many I print. Postage to ship one book costs around $2.60. And then there are envelopes, bags, etc... $5 per book barely covers those costs, that's why I rely on the other items to fund the project. Posters cost the least to produce, so if you're not sure what to order, know that posters will help a lot. I'm looking at 2 to 3 months of work when all is said and done. Above $2,000 and I will start to get \"paid\" for the work with about 10% going to the Kickstarter fees.\nThunder Monkey Poster and Variant Cover\nSTRETCH GOALS \nIf the $4,000 Stretch goal is reached I will reveal the uber secret THUNDER MONKEY HANDSHAKE. This grants entrance to an exclusive elite secret society of fandom. I will also send out a How to Draw THUNDER MONKEY PDF.\nIf the $6,000 Stretch goal is hit I will add an additional comic to all the US rewards at or above the \"Banana Split\" level. International backers will get one also, if it does not increase their shipping amount otherwise they will receive a collector's card.\nIf $9,000 is hit, an additional BRAND NEW second issue of THUNDER MONKEY will be funded and ALL backers will receive the entire second issue in digital form.\nTimeline\nThe script is written, the layouts are done and five of the 24 pages are colored and lettered. The colored sketches are also already in production. I have gathered quotes from printers and prices for shipping materials. Everything is ready to go. I expect to have the book printed by the end of July, but I gave myself a two month cushion.\nSample of Production Art - Layouts\nThis is a Kickstarter exclusive. As of now there are no plans to distribute the book by other means. I'm not going to order hundreds of extra copies.  \nI really wanted to have a local aspect so I have partnered with the following stores located in my area, and will be printing the books locally. If you let me know in the notes WHERE you will be picking up your rewards I will personalize your copy of the book!

Go back to your roots and make your bloody film. You're really good at it.\"  -- Mike Hill\n\"After months of thinking about how to relaunch this campaign and get this movie made, it was fellow artist and friend Mike Hill, who nailed the idea home for me. Many had suggested doing this film as a short, in the hopes of a producer or studio seeing it and perhaps wanting to fund the entire film, which does actually happen from time to time, but in my mind, I was over making short films, felt I'd made enough and wanted to move forward. At that time, making more shorts was a step backwards to me...\"\n\"Batman Dead End\" One of Sandy's first shorts, shot in 2003, which remains to this day, one of the most downloaded and controversial short films ever made.\nBut then Mike continued-- \"You've written so many scripts, Sandy. You have all these designs around your studio from these films that you haven't been able to make yet. If you make shorts of just a few of them, you can make an anthology. There's your feature, mate...\"\nSo, I got to thinking-- The two things I'm most known for, are a short film and a series of creature design books. Ya know what, he's right. It makes perfect sense...\n\"The Circle\", \"Cybertribe\", \"Guardians of Atlantis\" and \"Pollywog Bog\"-- more possible shorts for the anthology.\nThis film was originally written as a feature. Now, it's a smaller part of a much bigger picture, that I'm WAY more excited about!!!\n\"Heavy Metal magazine and the subsequent animated anthology film, were VERY influential and inspirational to me as an artist in my younger years. Using that format as a model, it's my goal over the next year and half, to create separate campaigns for each different short film, raising the funds to create my own anthology feature over time, as opposed to trying to raise all the money at once for a singular feature film.\"\nThe internet pretty much killed the magazine indusrty, but why don't they make movies like this anymore?\n\"Shallow Water\" is an intense, horror film, which will be the first short in this Horror/Science Fiction/Fantasy anthology from Sandy Collora, a longtime special effects artist, designer, sculptor, creature creator, and award winning commercial director and filmmaker.\nThe TIBURONERA-- he who hunts sharks. Our monster!\nIt combines the best of the two worlds with which Collora is so familiar. It is physical horror and psychological horror. It is eerie and intense. With a strong story and script, believable characters, and top flight performances, it strives for quality as a FILM, not just as a horror film. It's the perfect project to open the anthology with.\n\"This project combines so many things that I'm passionate about: classic horror, borne of mood and suspense; a memorable iconic creature; and the ocean environment. \"Shallow Water\" is a perfect storm of sorts, allowing me to combine my love of all these things into one film.\"\nThe SET-UP of the film --\nAn innocent adventure: a fishing trip to a remote and mythical fishing hole goes awry and becomes a terrifying predicament that keeps getting worse. Nestled deep in the Sea of Cortez is a tiny island you won't find on any map. Six fishermen scour the Baja peninsula to find this magical place, but when they finally reach their destination, they encounter some sea life that they did not expect. This puts them all at odds and it quickly becomes every man for himself. Which will prevail, Mother Nature or Human Nature?\nWhat happened to CLASSIC horror movies?\n\"Many horror films today rely on gimmicks. Found footage, shaky camera nonsense and of course, the whole \"Is it real?\" thing. The original masters of horror; F.W. Murnau, James Whale and Tod Browning, never needed those things and paved the way for Hitchcock, Kubrick and others who created true horror through mood and suspense. The 70's and 80's exploded with a whole new crop of scary, iconic horror films like \"The Exorcist\", \"ALIEN\", \"Halloween\", \"A Nightmare on Elm Street\" and \"Predator\". That was 30-40 years ago! Where did films like that go? Why has the horror genre taken such a turn? I'm going to make films that are gritty, real, moody and suspenseful, with new, original creatures. Throwbacks. No shaky cam, no gimmicks...\"\nThe meaning of \"SHALLOW WATER\" --\nSo much of the unique life that comes out of the ocean, dwells in the darkness of the deep. The abyssal plain. Depths of 500 feet or more. There's life in the Mariana Trench, the deepest part of our seas, that is yet undiscovered. Hydrothermal vents over a mile deep, contain life almost alien to our human eyes, but what about the shallows? How hard would it be for something that lives in the deep to swim up into the shallow water? Especially if it was hungry. It's a chilling thought what dangers lurk right under our feet in the murky shallow waters of our shores.\nAbout PRACTICAL EFFECTS --\nPractical Effects are special effects that are produced physically, without the use of post-production techniques like photographic manipulation and computer generation. These effects involve the use of sculpture, prosthetic makeup, animatronics, puppetry, body suits and other techniques that most realistically create the appearance of organic, living creatures. Especially for a film that has a creature with a human form, this is the best and most realistic way to achieve the desired effect.\nThe creature suit on location.\n\"Shallow Water\" will feature Practical Effects of the highest order, designed by Sandy Collora and created by Magee FX and an All-star team of makeup and special effects artists, all with experience on big budget FX films.\nThe TEAM --\n\"I'm incredibly fortunate to have a group around me who are not only enormously talented, but understand me as a creative person and support my vision. Most of them have been with me for quite some time and have worked on several commercial, music video and film projects with me. They are a very special group who have contributed so much.\"\nThe crew on location in Baja.\nClark Bartram-- Not only is he America's most trusted fitness professional, he's an inspiration to such a vast spectrum of people, all over the world. Clark played the titular role in the 2003 short film \"Batman Dead End\" directed by Sandy, that swept San Diego Comic Con. His work ethic and positive attitude is inspirational to the entire cast and crew. Sandy has said he simply could not imagine a production without him on the team.\nEric S. Dow-- An accomplished editor who brings his experience to the team from reality television on shows like Pawn Stars, Counting Cars and American Restoration. Last year, Eric wrote, directed and edited the popular documentary \"Behind the Mask: The Batman Dead End Story\". He was an assistant editor on \"Hunter Prey\" and will cut \"Shallow Water\". He is currently an editor for worldwide creative content at SONY Pictures.\nDale Pearson-- Co-producer, dive master, extreme location specialist and underwater cinematographer, Dale Pearson has been on many dive trips and adventures on the Baja Peninsula and worked on many projects with Sandy. Dale was instrumental in getting the \"Hunter Prey\" production team set up in Mexico. His experience on shows with the History Channel and National Geographic makes him a perfect, hands on producer, especially in extreme shooting locations.\nFelipe Perez Burchard-- One of Mexico's most talented, up and coming cinematographers, Felipe did a phenomenal job as camera operator on \"Hunter Prey\" which earned him the job of cinematographer on \"Shallow Water\". He has worked on many feature films, the most notable being \"Apocalypto\", in the camera department.\nWHY Kickstarter?\n\"Simple. Kickstarter is collaboration and creative freedom. It affords me flexibility I would not have with a publisher or a studio. By funding a project on Kickstarter, it can be collaborative yet still allow me to execute my vision. It really is a wonderful model. I love engaging with my backers, and I enjoy delivering what I've promised. Kickstarter has been a welcome change to the way I do business, and my life.\"\nAbout the REWARDS --\nDELIVERY DATE: The delivery date of November 2016 reflects the outside date when the short film will be available. Looking ahead, I'm hoping to fund and shoot the other shorts to complete the anthology in the next year and a half.\n\nCHOICES: All \"choices\" involved in any Reward tiers (t-shirt style and size, DVD or Blu-Ray, etc.) will be made after the campaign, on the Kickstarter survey form. All designs subject to change.\nCOMBOS: If there are Rewards you'd like that are not available in quite the exact combo you prefer-- send an email to Sandy and team by clicking \"contact me\" on the upper right. We'll be glad to work it out.\nThe Kenner style action figure!\n\"Besides having a really cool project, the rewards are the backbone of any campaign. I know when I back a project, they're the first thing I look at after the video...\"\nThe custom Mego action figure-- in progress.\n  T-shirts! Pick your favorite one!\nWith a film campaign, you've gotta have the basic stuff everyone expects; posters, T-shirts, and course the film itself-- DVDs and Blu-rays, etc... It kinda goes with the territory. But what we've done is come up with some really special rewards that are unique to this campaign. Check out the Art of Shallow Water book, which will have all the storyboards, poster designs and production art!\nThe book, unpainted resin bust and original storyboard!\nThis full figure, painted, resin production maquette (below) was used as reference to create the full body creature suits for the film. It was sculpted by writer/director Sandy Collora and renowned creature creator Jordu Schell. This absolutely stunning piece stands approximately 12 inches tall and will be offered painted, unpainted and unbuilt as well, for all the model kit enthusiasts who want to build and paint it themselves.\nFor the ULTIMATE reward-- a screen used creature head or full suit from the film! There will be a VERY limited number of these available after we finish shooting the movie. This is your chance to own an original screen used piece from \"Shallow Water\". Hey, you never know... if this film becomes a cult classic, you'll own a piece of horror movie history!\nScreen used creature suits and stunt masks.\nA prototype of our poster (below). Sent to you signed by Sandy and the cast and crew (subject to availability) How cool is that?!\nA little bit of that old school graphic design style...\nA FINAL thought --\nEighty five thousand dollars may seem like a lot for a short film, but it really isn't. Every cent will be on the screen. After all the rewards are made, shipped and the fees are paid, this is the bare minimum needed to make this ambitious short film-- if we're fortunate enough to go past the goal, the better we can make the film!\nI grew up on the original Star Wars, Alien and Predator films. I love them, but where are the NEW iconic creatures and characters? How long has it been since we've seen something truly unique and powerful in a genre film? Too long. If Hollywood won't do it, I will. With your help, over time we can raise enough independently to crowd fund a great anthology film.\" -- Sandy Collora\nChange starts with YOU.\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nMaking a film is by its nature, an incredibly complex and challenging endeavor. But this isn't my first barbecue. I've been in and around the industry for almost 30 years and have learned from some of the best in the business.\n\nWe've got a great idea, an excellent script and I've already created the primary creature. A significant portion of the crew is already aboard and they are accomplished veterans, many of whom have worked with me before on my previous films and commercials. The locations for the shoot have been determined and negotiated, and there are a limited number of sets. All these variables increase efficiency and ensure that upon funding, everything promised will be delivered. I understand the film making process; developing a realistic schedule, a scope of work, and a budget. I know how to adhere staunchly and when to adjust. I've asked for the amount of money needed to deliver a supremely high quality product, on schedule.\n\nFinally, I am a veteran project creator on Kickstarter. Backer rewards from my earlier campaigns were not just delivered on time, many were delivered early. For all these reasons, if this Kickstarter campaign succeeds, the film will be made, all rewards will be delivered fully and on a timely basis, and I believe you will be proud to have backed it.\n\nThank you. -- SC\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #23", "update_userinfo": "All I can really say here that would mean anything...", "update_content": "is THANK YOU...\nAs I ship off the remaining few boxes and envelopes to everyone, I feel blessed and so very fortunate to have not only your support, but your incredible patience.

It works with board games, card games, dice games and various other game types. Our system is perfect for game nights with friends, traveling with your games, gaming conventions or tournaments, as well as taking care of your games while at home.\nThis is THE essential tabletop game bag solution and its custom, purpose built design allows it to do things other bags can't. There is no other system like it. Your gaming experience will never be the same!\nWe\u2019ve spent 2 years conceptualizing, designing, redesigning, prototyping and getting this project ready. We are putting the finishing touches on the prototype and are ready for our first production run but need your help to make it a reality and bring the Gamefolio System to life!\nOur Gamefolio bags and cases are made of quality materials that are strong, durable, lightweight, flexible and water resistant. We\u2019ve combined that with additional padding and high quality hardware so that the Gamefolio System takes care of your games like a boss.\nPLAY\n\n  The Vault bag holds up to five Gamefolio cases in the main compartment.\n  Its great with your game boxes too!\n  Each Gamefolio case can hold 1-3 games depending on the size and configuration of each game.\n    The Gamefolio System is totally unique. It\u2019s got that special \u201cone of a kind\u201d quality that makes people take notice. It adapts to your games and your gaming lifestyle.\nGames are different. They use various combinations of boards, tiles, cards, dice, tokens, coins, and other components.\nAdditionally, game play situations are different. They can include game nights at home, out with friends, hanging out with your local guild or hitting up gaming conventions and tournaments. They can also include traveling across town or around the globe.\nThe Gamefolio System has got your back! So Keep Calm and Game On!\n    The Vault bag is versatile. Use it with your Game Boxes and our custom Gamefolios. The side pouches have extra room for more games, snacks and whatever else you need while gaming on the go!\nThe Vault bag can be used in conjunction with Gamefolio cases or directly with your games and boxes. Up to five Gamefolio cases can fit inside the main Vault compartment and 1-3 games can fit inside each Gamefolio case, depending on the size and structure of each game. \nThe side compartments can each hold several smaller games or one standard game box, while the main compartment can hold five standard size game boxes without Gamefolio cases. You can also mix it up and carry Gamefolios and game boxes at the same time.\nAs shown in the renderings on the right, our production model has more open access to the main compartment.\nIt adapts to your carry style and needs. Carry it with the included shoulder strap, the handles or use it like a backpack.\nRemovable shoulder strap included with each Vault bag.\nThe side pouches give you plenty of extra room for additional games, snacks, drinks, a laptop, a tablet, pens, paper or anything else you might need while gaming on the go!\n    The Vault bag and Gamefolio cases are very protective and water resistant by themselves but the Rain Cover add-on is for those who want to add another layer of protection to the system, making it extremely weather proof.\n  Gamefolio cases are your tabletop games new best friend. They allow you to instantly customize your game carrying, organization and storage. The custom design maximizes the number of games and gear you carry in a minimized amount of space. With a variety of pockets, pouches and slots, there is a place for everything!\nA place for all your gaming gear and all your gaming gear is in its place! Game boards fit inside a special protective pocket within each Gamefolio and hold boards that fold down to fit within dimensions measuring about 13.5\" x 11.5\" x 1.25\".\nBy carrying, organizing and storing your games with Gamefolios you get the added benefit of protecting your game boxes and the artwork thereon by leaving them safely at home. \nGamefolio cases keep this from happening to your boxes.\nKeep in mind our Vault bag is designed for use with your game boxes directly as well, with ample protection, should you choose to go that route.\nGamefolio cases are easier and lighter to carry compared to lugging around heavier game boxes and inserts. They also keep your game pieces from getting jumbled like a tossed salad or falling all over the place should you accidentally drop, bump or knock over a Gamefolio case or the bag they are in. Game boxes aren\u2019t so forgiving.\nUp to five Gamefolios fit inside the main Vault compartment. One, two or three games can fit inside each Gamefolio depending on the size and structure of each game. More Gamefolios equals more options for managing your game collection.\nOnly need a game or two for gaming on the go? No problem, just grab the Gamefolio case(s) containing the games you want to bring and you\u2019re out the door! (Either with or without the Vault bag.)\nGamefolios are great for organizing and storing your games at home as well as taking them on the go.\n  To back the Gamefolio System, choose a reward level that contains the specific reward you want in the right side column toward the top of this page. It's that simple! Once you have pledged, sit back and relax... But, only after you've told all your friends. We'll collect your shipping/fulfillment info when this project is complete.\nOnce you pledge, you're in for a fun ride.

How about extra Gamefolio cases or another Vault bag? Adding stuff to your reward is easy:\n1. Choose a reward level: Everybody must choose one (and only one) reward level to back this project. You cannot choose 2 reward levels. You will get all items in that reward level.\n2. Want to add-on something? If (and only if) you want to add something additional to your reward, check out the Add-On Menu above. If it's in the Add-On Menu you can add it to your reward by increasing your pledge by the amount specified in the menu. You can only add things to your reward that are in the Add-On Menu.\nIf you want to add a product that is not in the Add-On menu, don't worry. We will give you a chance to add additional products to your shipment after the campaign is over.\n3. Relax, you're done for now: All details like shipping information and add-on specifics will be collected via our Pledge Manager after this campaign has ended.\n  PLAY\n\n  PLAY\n\n  Nearly two years ago we (Curtis and Josh) were hanging out with our friends at TMG (Tasty Minstrel Games), no stranger to the tabletop gaming world and Kickstarter.\nWe, like you, love our games and want to make sure they are taken care of and protected. We want them easy to organize and to transport. We were tired of subpar non-solutions and thought it absurd that our beloved games were stuck being carried around from place to place in big blue shopping bags, or plastic tote bins, continually scuffing, scratching and damaging the beautiful box art along the way. That's not to mention the inevitable tossed salad effect on the game inside.\nSeriously, that\u2019s just not a solution. It's settling for something that's subpar. None of us should have to settle for subpar when we are so passionate about tabletop gaming.\nAs we discussed our frustrations with one another, we decided something needed to be done and a better solution needed to be created. Curtis and Josh set out to do just that. Over the next two years, with continual feedback, testing and design ideas from the TMG team, Curtis and Josh developed the Gamefolio System to make playing, transporting, storing and protecting your games simple and safe.\nWe are excited to make this dream a reality and for the chance we have to make a small contribution to the amazing world of tabletop gaming that we love so much. We\u2019ve got several additional KeepGear Vault bags, Gamefolio cases and accessories in the works and our Kickstarter backers will always be the first to know about them. Please back this project and join us for an incredible journey. Thanks for your help.\n  We love games and are obsessive about creating systems for organizing, protecting and streamlining the tabletop gaming experience.\nCurtis is a serial entrepreneur and inventor. He has built several successful companies. He knows how to efficiently manage resources and money to make a business or product successful, and deliver quality results to customers. He is continually looking at things from a different perspective, always striving to create something new or improve that which exists. One of his favorite games is Settlers of Catan, although he rarely wins.\nJosh is a highly skilled graphic designer and artist. The incredible artwork, sketches and graphic renderings of The Vault Gamefolio System, bags and cases throughout our Kickstarter campaign are his work. He\u2019s also got several years of experience working with manufacturers, taking ideas from concept, to design, to a finished product produced in high volume. One of his favorite games is Pandemic.\nThis dynamic duo is also backed up by a number of successful Kickstarter creators, other mentors, advisors, family, friends and supporters like you.\nWe understand the critical importance of taking care of our backers. Without you our project would not come to life. We are committed to using our skills, experience, connections, blood, sweat and tears to make sure that your pledges are used wisely to bring The Vault Gamefolio System to life.\nGet Your Project Funded Today!\n  All details like shipping information and add-on specifics will be collected via our Pledge Manager after this campaign has ended.\nUS shipping is shown on each pledge level and collected when you submit your pledge. The Vault bag is $15 shipping. The complete Vault Gamefolio System including the Vault bag with 4 Gamefolios will be $20 shipping. Depending on the additional add-ons you choose there may be other related shipping fees. We work hard to ensure the best pricing and care for your shipments.\nWe will be looking to do the same in other regions as we get a high enough number of backers in each region to make it viable.\nInternational shipping will be managed and collected through our pledge manager after the Kickstarter campaign ends. \nWhere possible we will be shipping your rewards from within your country or region. This is true for the EU, Australia, Canada, China and the US. If you are outside of those areas we will be shipping to you from a fulfillment center as near you as possible to keep shipping as low as possible.\nBelow are estimated international shipping costs. If you don\u2019t see your country below then look for a nearby country and your rates will be similar. If you would like more specifics on your country please message us directly so we can take care of you. These are estimates so if there is opportunity for additional savings we will make that happen for each country/region.\nPlease note that the estimates are for the specific reward listed at the top of each column. Any rewards that you Add-On to your pledge will add to the cost of shipping, but they will be bundled with the overall package so the total shipping will be much less than if the items were to be shipped separately.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe\u2019ve got a ton of business success in our DNA and have teamed up with experienced manufacturers to make this dream a reality. They know how to manufacture high-quality goods at high volume. We are confident that we will deliver what we say we will. Should unforeseen issues come up, we will handle them with the utmost transparency and care for you, our backers.\n\nForecasting Risk \nIf all goes well during our funding campaign, we'll finish up with a lot of backers and demand. Of course we're trying our hardest to predict our future demand and plan accordingly, but it's not an exact science. \n\nSupply Chain Risk \nWe have two separate manufacturing supply chains setup to make sure we can take care of our backers and bring our product to life. However, as prepared as we are it's safe to say that there is still some risk here. If a container shipment is delayed for 2 weeks in customs or a batch of new material doesn't pass QA testing, our fulfillment schedule\u2014even if padded\u2014can start to slip.\n\nActs of God \nHey, stuff happens, but no matter what that stuff may be, we will push through together to make this happen.

The Vault bag exterior has no noticeable smell and the inside only slightly has the smoky/musty smell. The gamefolios definitely have a stronger smell but it's by no means room clearing.

Building on what we learned in testing, we began drafting plans and specifications for the consumer-ready device, which brings us to where we are today.\nWe\u2019ve already done a lot of the legwork. The critical next steps are to finish work on the components and printed circuits for the final prototype, and begin testing the consumer version hardware. We\u2019re packing a lot of technology into HUB\u2019s compact form factor, and getting everything ready for primetime on schedule will require the combined efforts of our entire team. Now we\u2019re turning to Kickstarter to raise the funds needed to finish our consumer-ready prototype and bring HUB to the world.\nWhy Kickstarter?\nWhen we first started developing HUB, we quickly realized that we had something that people were going to love. The Kickstarter community has been responsible for supporting some amazing projects by creators like us, and we felt that they would be equally as excited about HUB. Today, we\u2019re proud to be sharing these exciting next steps with our backers and supporters.\nNext Steps\nBacker Rewards\nAbout the ekko Audio Team\nWe are a small but skilled group of creators and designers with a passion for all things technology + audio. Our diverse backgrounds include experience in project management, finance, various aspects of product design and development, shipping and logistics, UX/UI design, and more. After working together professionally on numerous projects over the last several years, we eventually teamed up to form our own product development startup and selected HUB as our pilot project.\nThe idea for HUB first came about when, over a few cups of coffee, we lamented the quality and selection of wireless audio devices, and resolved to do better. We brainstormed about a user-friendly wireless listening system that could meet the needs of the most discerning high-tech audiophile, while keeping things simple enough for anyone to enjoy. After a few hundred more cups of coffee, HUB began to take shape, and we enlisted the expertise of several other colleagues including product designers, developers and engineers to help us make HUB a reality.\nGet Your Project Funded Today!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are many challenges when it comes to designing and manufacturing a product like HUB.

We\u2019ve got two new volumes here that we think you\u2019ll enjoy. First\u2014and a big thank you for all those who have been waiting so patiently\u2014we offer the oversized Storms at Sea signed deluxe edition, featuring all of Mark\u2019s illustrations displayed exactly as the uncropped, full-board originals, and at a much larger size than the trade edition.\nAnd then we have something completely new\u2014the deluxe edition of Mark\u2019s Carbon2, a collection of his latest works, most of them published here for the first time, in the grand tradition of 2013\u2019s Carbon.\nThis is John\u2019s fifth Kickstarter campaign, and his second with Mark. You know by now the excellent quality you can expect from these two old campaigners, but please take a look below for examples of what you can expect within the covers, and for awards.\nAs always, we appreciate your consideration!\nMark Schultz: Carbon, New Art Book:\nCover to Carbon 2 by Mark Schultz\nCarbon 2 Book Details:\n56 pages for the paperback and 58 pages for the deluxe, 9 x 12 inches. Comes in a paperback trade edition, as well as a Flesk exclusive: a deluxe signed edition, hardcover with jacket, limited to 600 copies.\nSample book spread for Carbon 2\nThe first thing you can count on in any collection from Mark Schultz is a kind of subject matter, featuring outr\u00e9 situations involving daring men and women, and, often, fearsome beasts. The second thing you can count on is his allegiance to certain graphic medium\u2014generally brush and ink, and graphite and charcoal, but sometimes watercolor too. The third thing you can count on is that, although the subject matter and media stay consistent, his design, draftsmanship and control of his presentation are always evolving and growing, Here, in Carbon 2, his work has become noticeably bolder\u2014more viscerally engaging.\nSample book spread for Carbon 2\nCarbon 2 follows its predecessor by three years, and in those years Mark\u2019s work has become something more solid, and at times almost sculptural, as he continues to refine his attempts to put to paper the visions he sees in his head. Featuring conceptual studies as well as finishes, Carbon 2 gives us a look into that process.\nSample book spread for Carbon 2\nOf course there are plenty of lovely warrior women, including more in the Pulpette series, as well as portraits of his Xenozoic characters, Hannah Dundee and Jack Tenrec, negotiating dire straits. There is also sword and sorcery, ancient mythic tableaus, and otherworldly science fiction to satisfy the most diverse tastes. And there are preliminaries and rejected pieces from Storms at Sea, and, (spoiler alert) design work and character studies from Mark\u2019s new in-progress Xenozoic graphic novel. Qua hoon!\nSample book spread for Carbon 2\nThe large-format Carbon 2 features over fifty of Mark\u2019s newest works across its pages.\nThe hardbound deluxe edition is limited to 600 copies.

Ever. In my world, if you need to lie, it\u2019s already too late.\u201d\nA scientist working to develop a new source of limitless energy is dead, and the man who was hired to protect him needs to know why.\nSample book spread for Storms at Sea\nThe dead man\u2019s niece and a mysterious manuscript from his laboratory safe may hold all the answers, or they may lead down an endless rabbit hole ending in madness and cataclysm.\nNow the man named Griff must decide how far he can trust the girl--and how much he is willing to risk--as he stumbles blindly toward the powers that control our fates.\nSample book spread for Storms at Sea\nStorms at Sea is Mark Schultz\u2019s new, heavily illustrated novella that explores the border between what we want to believe is true and the reality that we'd prefer to keep concealed.

What a perfect opportunity to produce the special projects that would never have seen the light of day in the world of traditional publication and distribution. This is all about the hardcore readers and collectors who want an extraordinary experience. With Kickstarter we have the proven path for getting that experience produced and in their hands.\nJohn Fleskes: It's the community aspect that I enjoy the most. Your support allows us to improve upon the quality of the books as we receive more pledges. We conceive of our grandest ideas and with our supporters have a chance to achieve them through stretch goals. It's all a very exciting process.\nMark's thoughts on working with John and Flesk Publications\nWhat more can I say about working with Flesk Publications that hasn\u2019t already been said? I\u2019ll let my 12-year association with them as my primary publisher stand as my testament. They are, simply put, the best at what they do\u2014which is to produce the highest-quality publications in concert with the goals of the artist. It comes down to integrity and the willingness to share a vision. I\u2019m smart enough to know that I\u2019m not going to find better.\nJohn's thoughts on Mark:\nWith Mark, it's like working with family. Here's a guy who I've had the good fortune to become friends with and whose artwork completely captivates me. As I make and publish his books it's my goal to create a lasting quality art object to share with others and to make Mark feel proud.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhy you should trust Flesk Publications? John answers:\n\"I pride myself on having a 14 year record of delivering over seventy books on time and of the highest quality. Of course, things don't always go exactly as planned in the publishing world. Much of the time they do, but sometimes an unexpected problem or delay arises. In the rare case that this happens, simply put, I deal with it and find a way to get the job done. I am very open about any challenges and like to share in the process so people know what's going on. I don't like surprises, and don't feel anyone else should either. I respect the artist, and our supporters too much to let them down. The good thing is that I've published over seventy books, filled thousands of Kickstarter orders and I know how to manage a schedule and keep projects on track, and I will stay motivated and energized to get the books into your hands when I said I would. Bottom line, I would not have been around this long without an excellent track record.\"\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #24", "update_userinfo": "New Mark Schultz Carbon 3 Kickstarter Campaign Launched Today!", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #23", "update_userinfo": "Carbon 3 by Mark Schultz Coming Soon!", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #22", "update_userinfo": "The Latest in Schultz News!

Extra Rules you say? \nYep - and thank to your hard work, here's a video outlining the rules for \nMONSTER LAB LITE\nA simple, kid and casual gamer friendly version of Monster Lab. Enjoy!\nAbout The Game\nThe Basics: Build monsters and use them attack your opponents Labs in order to collect valuable specimens to win the game. Wreak havoc on your opponents with powerful actions and item cards while avoiding the monster hunters that keep reappearing and trying to destroy your Lab. The first Lab to collect 5 Monsters wins! Or claim victory by destroying all your mad scientist rivals and be the last Lab standing!\nIt's ALIVE!\nCreated by Liam McIntyre (from TVs Spartacus and The Flash) and illustrated by Cris Olansamuelle (Draw Them All), Monster Lab is a card game about channeling your inner Mad Scientist to create incredible, wild and crazy creatures out of Spare Parts, and use them to battle your way past rival Labs to victory. It's part Munchkin, part Exploding Kittens and part Epic Spell Wars, but with a Madcap Monster Method all of its own. It's perfect for 2-6 players, and each game lasts about an hour.\nTo play, you draw cards to collect Spare Parts that you then fit together to make one of thousands of weird and wonderful Monster combinations that help you protect your Lab and battle your rivals. You can also draw Lab Cards that give you special bonuses like the Pig O' Nine Tails, a Bat to the Face or a Shiny Monster Butt that help you and hurt your opponents. You attack your Rivals to steal their Monsters and destroy their Defenses, while trying to protect your Lab to make sure you don't get Run Out Of Town (and out of the game) by Monster hating Monster Hunters hiding in the deck or your opponents out for revenge. The game keeps heating up Monster Hunters keep returning to the deck, so the longer you play, the more they'll appear and the more damage they'll do. \nIt looks a bit like this. A LOT like this.\nWe think the combination of trying to build up your army of Monsters, whilst trying to avoid destruction from both Monster Hunters and your Rivals creates an exciting balance between attack and defense, while the huge range of special Lab Card abilities allows you to stay in the game and cause an upset no matter how far behind you think you are. This makes each game of Monster Lab tense and fun, and always different from the last. Add to that our personal favorite - the almost endless combinations of funny and fearsome Monsters you can make and we think you'll find it's a blast for adults and kids alike.\nSo welcome to the Lab! We really want our backers to feel part of the creative process, so we welcome ideas for cards and monsters, and anything else you guys can think of! We hope you're excited as we are and can help us realize our dream of building Fire Breathing Catzillas that can Time Travel in a Hot Tub.\nWith green tubs of ooze and Monstery Love\nLiam and Cris, the Monster Lab Team.\nA Guide!\n OR Watch us play a round on SMOSH GAMES (sorry about Liam's giant head there)...\nStuff You Get.\nThe Team.\nLiam and Cris, working in the Lab.\nMonster Lab was created by Liam McIntyre (from TVs Spartacus and The Flash) and illustrated by Cris Olansamuelle (Draw Them All). Liam has dreamed of making a game since he was about 5 years old, and Cris is an exceptional artist that has worked at conventions and a fantastic online cartoon called 'Draw Them All', among other things.\nThey've collaborated on this project for over 6 months, changing the game from a bare bones idea about making Monsters out of parts to the fun and frantic game you see today.\nIn The Beginning...\nThe origins of Monster Lab start off with Liam sitting next to Nathan Fillion in a Comic Con in Australia. There was a lull in the crowd, and Liam went off to buy yet more board games - his favorite convention past time - as he was sitting at his table looking through some of his new acquisitions, he thought... WAIT! I SHOULD MAKE A CARD GAME!\nHe promptly started making a card game. It was about sword fighting (of course) and he wrote it on the back of card sleeves with a marker. Weeks later, he realized this was a very, very hard card game to make. He's still making it (maybe it'll be the next game he releases!). Then, whilst playing a card game on his computer, he had another Eureka moment. I SHOULD MAKE A DIFFERENT GAME! And so he did.\nHe thought about games that he liked, that were fun and accessible. One that stood out was a card game his wife and her family played in Australia called '31'. Basically you have three cards, the aim of that game is to draw and discard cards until you're close to a total of 31, all in the same suit. Then you knock on the table, everyone has one more go, reveals their cards, and whoever has the highest total, wins. It's bluffing, it's trying not to give the other players good cards to steal, it's simple, it's fun. It seemed like a great place to start. He liked the three card element, so started there - except in this version, the challenge was going to be to build a monster that's broken into three parts. Each monster got a points value, and to simulate the suits, the monsters were of 4 different 'families', Elemental, Mutant, Robotic and Alien. It was pretty cool. But it wasn't...well... Fun. And fun seemed to be important. So with the help of some long suffering friends, he began trialing different approaches. It briefly became about killer penguins (rated high on the wife's 'cute scale') before returning to more cartoon-y monsters.\nRules were changed so the monsters had to fit together in different sizes, because early tests showed that, with good art, this could look endlessly hilarious. Then we worked out there should be some 'Munchkin' style abilities to sabotage your opponents' plans, cause who doesn't like messing up your friends best laid plans!? We also figured you should have to build 5 Monsters, after which everyone counted their score. Shortly after this, we started play testing it.\nThere were...quite a lot of test versions of Monster Lab.\nThere was one infamous game that lasted about 6 hours where no one could build enough monsters to end the game. So we added in the Monster Hunters element which meant there was an added threat to drawing cards, which seemed fun, and, ultimately, a ticking clock on the game that added some urgency to playing and give the game an increasing tension (and an actual ending). Next we figured that the constant 'why can't the Monsters fight each other?' question we'd been asked by, oh, EVERYONE... should be addressed, so completely redesigned it again so that the Monsters could fight - which proved to be AWESOME! Lastly we decided to change the game from being a 'score as many points as you can' system,which was complicated and unwieldy, to a game with a definite goal to reach. It made more sense that the scientists were out to create something phenomenal to beat each other, so we changed it to be about collecting Monsters, where players battled to obtain a certain amount of points in order to win. This proved a good idea as it gave another level of tension - and by including 'Lab Defenses' as a sort of 'Lives' component for players, now we had something that had was feeling like a really engaging game. The Monster Hunters were also a great mechanic as they start appearing more and more frequently and, at some point, it means the game can become a choice between going for the win, and trying to survive longest to win by being the Last Lab Standing, which added a host of great tactical choices to the game play.\nAfter that hard work, there was just the fun part - the naming of the creatures. That's something we're still doing, and really want your feedback on! During the campaign will be asking you to nominate options, and also vote on your favorites.\nFor Liam, the last, and in many ways most important, piece of the puzzle was finding an incredible artist to do the complicated and challenging art for the game. Since the cards were both wild and wacky, but also had to fit together in some interesting, coherent and fun way across three cards, the technical side was very challenging. Also, since the visual side was such a big component to making the monster combinations and the character of the game, you wanted the art to really sell that sense of fun and that 'mad scientist' flavor. So it was with incredibly good fortune that Cris agreed to come on board to help out. Her art is truly out of this world, and the game wouldn't be ANYTHING without it. So with all the pieces in place, all that was left was to plan the Kickstarter campaign and see what you all thought of this crazy game!\nThanks for the support, can't wait to hear from you and answer your questions, and hear your response to our crazy little game!\nSome places to CHECK IT OUT!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe long and the short of it is - it's a card game, not brain surgery (unless for some reason brain surgery gets included as a Monster Lab stretch goal. It probably won't). The game is basically done - we're currently tweaking the rules and finishing the huge amount of art required, and we just want help with the finishing touches, and knowing how many we should be making and making sure the quality is as good as it can be. To that end, there may be changes to cards or to rules that we discover are required as we further balance the game - don't be sad if something changes, we're making the game better, promise!\n\nAll we're interested in doing is getting you the best possible game, as quickly as possible. For that reason, the Rewards are tailored around being simple, satisfying and easy to deliver. We love Swag as much as the next person, but we love the idea of getting you a great game, when we promised, far more than making a cool bumper sticker. You back the project, you get a game. Easy.\n\nThis IS our first Kickstarter campaign. and it's a doozy of a learning curve. However, we've tried to do as much of the hard work as possible before launching the campaign, so already have a supplier (the wonderful people at Ad Magic, who also create some other amazing games like Cards Against Humanity and Exploding Kittens) to make the game for us, done a full budget breakdown on Shipping to ensure that we have a plan to ensure shipping is either free or as low as they can be for you, and with a trusted fulfillment company and a host of other essential 'behind the scenes' activities to ensure that, should we be fully funded, you'll get what you backed.

It's not just any portfolio bag -- It will be your everyday companion from this day, until your last day.\nWith this bag you can carry all of those supplies in a backpack configuration. You don't need to suffer a shoulder bag, or to carry it in your hands.\nLet's be clear: the traditional bag dies today.\nThe backpack straps\nAmbi Bag carries total internal capacity is 18\" by 27\"\nThis bag was made by an artist, for artists. This bag is meant to meet your needs, your daily tribulations, your life!\nLet me be clear: I personally use this bag to carry materials and my 18\" drawing board every time I go to the studio, a few days per week, in all kinds of weather.\nMaterials\n1000D Nylon sample\nExtra strong stitches keep it all together!\nThe bag itself is made from 1000D Nylon, more resistant to abrasions and scrapes. It's a good balance of strength, cost, and weight. \nThe manufacturer added these extra strong stitches to make sure that the bag won't fail on you at the wrong time!\n4-5 mm wooden spine + foam insert for comfort\nThe bag's entire back is made from a wooden spine! Let's see the traditional portfolio bag do that!! This keeps the bag itself rigid, keeping the bag's contents flat, and safe. There's a layer of foam to keep the wearer comfortable. No more tubes, no more warped pads\nThe Ambi Bag also features an internal spine, to keep the bag taut, reducing tension on the insides of the bag itself, taking forces that might other wise crush or warp your artwork inside.\nRobustness\nWith the Ambi Bag you can comfortably walk through virtually all kinds of weather. I personally have tested out the bag in the rainy winter we had in San Francisco recently and it held up just fine in moderate rains, keeping art work and supplies inside dry and secure.\nTestimonials\nSee what these other cool, hip artists have been saying\n\"YES, YES YES\" -- random art student I met at a bar. I just showed her a picture and she didn't even have to hear what I was saying; she knew. She Knew.\n\"Dude, this is awesome!\" -- Dick Blick patron\n\"Please father my children\" -- grateful art student\nLife with out Ambi Bag\nThis person is not fine. He needs Ambi Bag\nCorrect. The most uncomfortable you've ever been is before you had an Ambi Bag\nWhich looks easier to carry? A back pack or a big, maladroit bag that's too big to fit your arms around?\nEvery other portfolio bag is a big, ungainly thing. It hits your legs as you walk. It's an exercise in frustration, designed to maximize inconvenience and discomfort, like a sleeping bag made from paper. \nCost\nWhen will the government stop his sinful hands?\nAnother issue we address with Ambi Bag is cost. Too many art supplies are very expensive. We've tried to keep the price down to be more affordable as we can, to make sure everyone enjoys walking hands free!\nI live in San Francisco and have seen far too many students spend far too much money on bags that don't meet their needs or fall apart after some time.

About a year and a half ago, my then 3-year-old son wouldn't come down to my basement studio. When my wife asked him why not, he said he was scared. And, when she asked what he was scared of, he pointed at all of my zombie artwork hanging from the walls.\nWith this inspiration, I wrote the manuscript for this story over the next hour, and I've been working on tweaking the rhyme and meter, the art, learning about the picture book industry, and publisher and agent submissions ever since.\nWith some very encouraging rejection letters under my belt, I'm happy to announce the self-publication of this book with your help!\nRewards:\n$5 digital copy of the book AND a thank you on my website!\n$10, I'll also send you a signed, limited-edition postcard \nReward #3: Everything in Reward #2 PLUS this limited-edition, signed postcard\n$25 you will receive everything in reward #3 PLUS the signed, limited-edition hardcover of the book (if you want more than one book, add $25 to your pledge for each book.

However, the charging tech still lags far behind. \nUsBidi is created as a charger that is reliable, battery saving, time saving, mess/tangle free, and worthy of our beloved phones and tablets. \nA charger with a mix of great intelligence and beautiful art, will make our daily charging task easier, faster and happier.\nCharging Has Evolved, for Android and iOS Devices\nUsBidi is the most intelligent charger that not only doubles the charging speed on computer USB, but also automatically shuts off power completely once fully charged so you don't have to unplug. It spares your device from battery killers like heat and mini-charging-cycles, extending battery life with healthier battery and longer-lasting charges.\nIt has additional awesome features - LED indicator showing you at-a-glance the charging status, magnetic ends for tidy hold, durable and colorful braided exterior with a variety of lengths (1, 3 or 6 Feet / 0.3, 0.9 or 1.8 Meters) to choose from. \nUsBidi charger is designed to work with both your phones and tablets. It is available in two versions - MFi certified Lightening version for Apple devices and Micro USB version for Android devices.\nKeeps Battery Healthier and Maximizes Its Life\nHow does this work?\nA lot of us leave our phones and tablets plugged in charging for extended periods, such as overnight. When left plugged in after the battery is full, a regular charger will cause elevated temperature and mini-charging-cycles, damaging the battery capacity and shortening its life over time. \nUsBidi is created with an intelligent built-in PCB that shuts off charging circuit completely once battery is full, as though it has been unplugged. And your device will charge again next time when you plug it in. \nThe auto. power shut-off feature is comparable to an \"auto-unplug\" function. No more stressing your precious battery for 8 hours every night, wearing down its capacity.\nThere are billions of devices left plugged in every night wasting a little energy and generating heat. UsBidi's \"auto-unplug\" feature could save considerable energy, if we are lucky enough to reach great number of consumers with your help.\nCharges Your Phones 2 x as Fast\nHow does this work?\nWhen your phone is plugged into a computer's USB port, the regular charger will do data syncing and charging at the same time, which is the reason why the charging speed is so slow. \nUsBidi charger gets a touch switch that stops data syncing once pressed, so that all the power available will be used to boost the charging speed.\nWhen you finish syncing, simply press the button to switch into Smart & Fast mode. UsBidi will double the charging speed and cut your charging time in half.\nMagnetic Ends for Tidy Hold\nStore UsBidi using its magnetic ends anywhere, always mess free. \nLED Indicator Shows You Charging Status at-a-Glance\nYou don't have to pick up the phone to read its charging status any more.\n UsBidi in the News\nWhy Did We Create UsBidi Charger?\nA regular charger gets messy. It breaks, wastes energy and slowly kills the battery with heat and mini-cycles.\nHow often do you have to charge your phone despite being promised 14 hours of battery? With the regular charger causing battery damages, your experience just gets worse!\nExperts warn us, \"Don't leave your fully charged phone plugged in\". It can damage and weaken your battery over time. \nBattery Care Tips\nDo You Find These Familiar?\nApple tells us, \"Remove certain cases during charging\". Samsung says, \"Unplug once fully charged\". \n But it shouldn't be this complicated. That's why we have created UsBidi.\nGreat Features You've Been Looking For\nCompared to Regular Chargers\nWhy Kickstarter - We Need Your Help\nWe've come a long way from where we began. All the obstacles are behind us now, and the top quality manufacturing partner has lined up, but we can't go any further without the support from you!\nWith your help, we will be able to meet the requirement of minimum orders to start production. \nCharging has evolved again! Pledge now and help us spread the words, together we will bring UsBidi to the consumers market and of course your hands!\nSelect Your Rewards\nPick Your Choices at the End of the Campaign\nAvailable in two versions - Micro USB version for Android devices or MFi certified Lightning version for Apple devices. \nChoose your favorite color and preferred length for any one of your charger.\nYou can pick your choices by responding to a survey at the end of the campaign. We will design the survey to be super easy for the combination of your choices. \nProject Timeline\nWe started the idea and feasibility study in May 2014 to safeguard our devices battery by re-engineering the charger. And soon we identified more improvements that can tackle people\u2019s common complaints about charging.\nFollowing over a year of intense work on concepts, detailed design, manufacturer assessment & selection, prototyping, testing and fine-tuning, now we are ready to go into mass production with your help.\nWhere Will Your Pledges Go", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nFrom years of engineering experience with daily cross discipline collaboration, we understand what it takes to bring an innovative product to fruition.\nWe've chosen to spend the whole last year going through all the processes, and refused to start the Kickstarter campaign until now everything was all set and ready to go.\nThe selected manufacturing partner is one of the top charger/cable manufacturers, and has been supplying mobile charging product all over the world along with the 1st-gen smartphones. It has demonstrated its experience, attention to details and effective certified management systems, when producing our working prototypes. \nWe're going to use the same manufacturer for the next mass production, and we will also supervise the manufacturing and QC process.
