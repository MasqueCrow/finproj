[{"backer": "Hrothgar's Hoard", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": " Issue #005 is the Kobold issue of Maximum HP, The old school \u2019zine for a new school world. In this issue we explore the world of the kobolds, their tricks, traps, and treats. Discover the various breeds, skills, magic, lives, and of course, the dastardly kobold traps.\n\nIn this project we are returning to our 1E roots, and releasing this Zine Quest project in the FIRST EDITION of the world's favorite roleplaying game.\nWe're a 'zine for gamers by gamers. Taking submissions from gamers all over and sharing the best with our readers. We intend to enrich the gaming experience of our readers and help them offer new and unique challenges to their table.\nAt Fail Squad Games, we offer rousing content for your tabletop roleplaying games. What follows in this and upcoming issues of Maximum HP are articles, notes, tips, tricks, traps, and treasures for your 1E gaming table. To keep the zines fresh and exciting, we have liberated ourselves from a production deadline to allow us to channel maximum creativity into each issue.\nOur intent is to share the Fail Squad Games style with other gamers to enrich their gaming experience. The zine format presents small, easy to digest articles firmly rooted in the spirit of the older edition games and magazines. Although the content may be informal, we want the physical product and presentation to be the best we can deliver for the cost.\nEach issue is digest-sized 5.5\" wide x 8.5\" tall. This issue is color cardstock cover with black & white interior pages. We expect 40-50 pages of Koboldic content.\nThis is our FIFTH 'zine release. You will be able to get any of the previous issues through your backer pledge level or Backerkit add-ons and extras once the project is underway.\nExpect new adventures, items, and more for your 1E game from various contributors in the RPG field. New Kobolds, new items, new adventure ideas to fuel your table for a long time to come. \nThis year we once again, hop on the Zine Quest train in February for Kickstarter. \nWe are a perfect bound zine and our usual print house is discontinuing saddle stitching anyway. So we are continuing with the same great quality as all our previous releases.\nThis is our 20th kickstarter to date. All our 19 previous projects have been delivered on-time or early. We expect the same with this one since we have this process pretty well figured out now.\nWhile Kickstarter started offering \"Add-ons\" they were a bit confusing on the last project. We are going to give Backerkit another try this round so you all may add on back issues and extra copies if you wish.\nYou can watch us live on Twitch!\nMaximum HP gets circulated to Kickstarter backers, at conventions, in our online store, through Drivethru RPG, and around the world via AMAZON, Barnes & Noble, and Walmart outlets among others.\nYour ad here gets a lot of miles and stays in the publication as long as it's in print and trade.\nFor just a few bucks your ad gets in front of a lot of gamer eyes and helps us manage the cost of production and distribution.

Using its new and improved sensors, Arsenal 2 fine tunes your camera's settings by analyzing 22 different environmental factors. The result is great settings for any shot.  \nArsenal 2\u2019s Deep Color uses a neural network to intelligently develop each photo. Deep Color is not a look or a filter. Instead, it produces a set of adjustments custom to each photo. The results are balanced yet powerful, rendering bold images that flatter every photo without being over the top. See the difference below compared to a camera's built-in colors. \nSee our \u201cHow it works\u201d section below for more details.\nArsenal 2 controls your camera over USB and automates some of the most powerful photography techniques. The onboard GPU automatically stacks photos and sends them to your phone\u2014or saves them to Arsenal 2\u2019s micro SD card slot (See FAQ for details). \nNight photography is notoriously difficult. Arsenal 2\u2019s Night Assist makes it easy. It can focus on the stars with a tap*, then calculate the perfect settings to get sharp, detailed night photos.\n*Night focus times vary by camera and lens. Night focus normally requires between 30 seconds and 2 minutes to get stars in perfect focus. See the FAQ for lens compatibility.\nPanoramas make for powerful photos, but there\u2019s too much guessing involved. With Arsenal 2\u2019s live panorama, you can be sure you didn\u2019t miss anything. The Arsenal Phone Mount accessory (sold separately) holds Arsenal 2 and your phone, so you can watch the panorama build as you shoot. When you\u2019re done, crop the final output and it's ready to share.\nIn some locations, there will always be someone in your photo. By combining multiple shots, Arsenal 2\u2019s new Crowd Control feature can automatically remove people and other moving objects from your photos.\nArsenal 2 ships in Standard and Pro versions. Both have the same software features (and support the same cameras), but Arsenal 2 Pro brings even more performance improvements, added weather resistance, and USB-C connectivity. \n*Micro SD card sold separately, see the \"Accessories\" section below\n\nArsenal 2 automates advanced photo stacking techniques to help you capture scenes with High Dynamic Range (HDR). In seconds, Arsenal 2 takes multiple exposures and blends them into a single shot capturing details in both bright and dark areas of the scene.\nWith Arsenal 2, you can create long exposures that capture rich color and dramatic motion blurs...without buying expensive neutral density filters.\nWith focus stacking, you can get your entire scene in sharp focus. Arsenal 2 calculates the ideal aperture, takes shots at different focus positions, and merges them into one crystal clear image.\nWe love timelapses, so we spent five years designing the ultimate timelapse tool. Start your timelapse with a tap...or set custom parameters. Arsenal 2 will intelligently manage the exposure to create a smooth day-to-night transition. You can even preview your timelapse while it\u2019s being recorded. You (and your phone) can leave. Come back any time to change settings or check progress. Arsenal 2 takes care of the rest. \nArsenal 2's powerful new processors allow for faster intervals, smoother transitions, and higher quality previews.\nCheck out some of our timelapses shot with Arsenal 2.\n\nArsenal 2 lets you control your camera from up to 100 feet away. Tap to focus, set shutter speed, aperture, and ISO; see a live preview; and take the shot\u2014all from your phone.\nSharing photos from your DSLR or mirrorless camera shouldn\u2019t be hard. Use Arsenal 2 to automatically sync full-resolution photos to your phone, or send individual photos to your favorite apps with a tap.\nCheck out our Deep Color gallery for more examples.\nArsenal 2 supports over 100 popular DSLR and mirrorless camera models, 23 of which are new for Arsenal 2. \nClick here to view all supported cameras\nArsenal 2 controls your camera via a USB cable (included), and you control Arsenal 2 wirelessly from your phone. Arsenal 2\u2019s free mobile app is compatible with modern iOS and Android devices. \n Arsenal 2 Pro works with all of the same cameras as Arsenal 2 Standard. \nHi, my name is Ryan. I\u2019m a software developer, photographer, and the creator of Arsenal. I love learning. Photography let me learn something new and experience more of the beauty we have here in Montana. Arsenal started as a way to improve my own photography.\nWhen I launched the original Arsenal campaign on Kickstarter, there was more demand that I ever expected. During the campaign, I was fortunate to be able to hire some of the smartest and most talented people I know. Three years on, we're still a small team. Yet thanks to everyone\u2019s expertise, we\u2019ve been able to do things normally exclusive to much larger companies.\nShipping and Taxes\nPlease be aware that shipping and taxes are not included in the pledge levels. Shortly before Arsenal 2 ships, we will email you a link to our \u201cpledge manager.\u201d In the pledge manager, you can:\nEnter your latest address\nPay Shipping and Tax\nOrder accessories, additional cables, or additional Arsenal 2\u2019s.\nUpgrade to Arsenal 2 Pro\nShipping charges vary based on your country - $10 U.S., and $20 International. There are no additional shipping charges for add-ons, extra USB cables, or multiple Arsenal 2 units.\nTaxes will vary based on where your rewards are shipped (Sorry, I don\u2019t make the rules). For the following countries, we're collecting taxes before shipping, so you won\u2019t have to worry about paying them at the time of delivery, extra fees, or being held up in customs. \n United States: State sales taxes apply in most states.\n European Union, United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia: VAT/GST taxes apply.\n Other Countries: We will not charge any taxes in the pledge manager. However, you may be responsible for sales tax, VAT/GST taxes, duties, import fees, or other taxes/fees when your reward is delivered.  \nWe plan to ship Arsenal 2 units directly to backers within the US, EU, UK, CA, and AU, using existing fulfillment partners with local warehouses. That means your rewards will arrive promptly with no international shipping hassles.\nMedia Inquiries \nPlease send media inquires to press@witharsenal.com\nThis project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 1,100+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $460M raised between them.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our second Kickstarter campaign. After our first campaign we delivered over 100,000 Arsenals to our backers across the globe. And along the way we built up tools, relationships, and expertise that will help us to deliver Arsenal 2. \n\nFrom a technology standpoint, much of the work that went into Arsenal 1 can be reused as a foundation for Arsenal 2 (both Standard and Pro). A lot of the work required to get Arsenal 1 out the door wasn\u2019t feature specific, but involved things like camera integration, mobile app communication and deployment, firmware management, user interface design, bug tracking, etc. Having that foundation means we can spend more time optimizing performance and testing features. \n\nFor Arsenal 2, we\u2019ve completed all of the hardware development, and our manufacturing partners are already established and ready to go to production once parts are in. We\u2019ve also expanded our Support team, hired a Logistics Manager, and upgraded our fulfillment partners so that shipping is quick and easy. \n\nEven with all of the planning we\u2019ve done, issues always come up. COVID-19 adds another layer of challenges, and we've adjusted our schedule to reflect COVID realities. Could COVID-19 or something else throw us a curveball? You bet. With an expanded team of great people to support the launch, I\u2019m confident we can address any complications that come up.

Traditional RPGs are concerned with simulation - whole pages devoted to variations on polearms or travel distances for unladen dwarves in swamps. Cartomancy doesn\u2019t care about that. A halberd and a disintegrator beam can use the same rules as long as they play the same part in the story. Indi RPGs are often concerned with putting rules to narrative. Cartomancy knows that sort of design can trap you into playing one type of story. The system cares about making a fun game that can represent whatever story you want to tell.\nCartomancy will be a digest-sized black and white book accompanied by playing cards. The game can be played using any poker deck but these cards are designed to set your imagination free from whatever preconceived worlds you may have had in mind. If you want to play in a fairly standard fantasy or science fiction setting you can--but you can also play through political conflict in the heart of an ant colony or travel with psychic velociraptor pilgrims (and without much more GM work than modifying hit dice and special templates in rules-heavy systems).\nProve it\nAn RPG system that lets you play in any setting without a pile of supplementary books is a big claim, and that requires some big proof. If you back, even at a dollar, you will get immediate access to a digital beta test copy (look for the link in the first \"Backer Only\" update). You can see for yourself if you think it can do what I claim.\nSecond, go to the comments and make a challenge. Give me an idea (a setting, obstacle, or ability) that you want at your gaming table. I\u2019ll brew something up to do the job if the existing rules don\u2019t already cover it.\nThe Kickstarter\n Book. Cartomancy is a digest-sized black and white book with all the game rules you need to role play in any setting that has big conflicts. \n Cards. All physical level backers will receive two high-quality decks of cards (310 GSM with a black core and linen finish, for those of you who know cards) with fully custom front and back designed by lead artist Kayleigh Shaw.  \n Box Supreme. Elite backers will receive a cherry wood box, hand made by a local artisan, to store both the book and cards in. \n Custom Art. At the highest levels, you can become part of the card art. Each of these rewards is tied to a specific card. At the end of the campaign, the lucky backer will send in a picture along with a list of their favorite things for our artist to draw inspiration from. This will become the basis for the named card in our deck. \nFinal version of the box for the \u201cSupreme\u201d level and custom card levels\nHandcrafted in cherry\nStretch Goals\nWe want to focus on delivering the best possible game without the complexity of dealing with many extras. But there is one thing we are just too excited about to keep under our hats...\n$7,000 Variant Cover. At this funding level, we will commission another artist to design an additional cover. Physical backers (or higher) will be able to add on books with this variant cover for $12 each. \nAdd-Ons\nBackers at the Physical level (or higher) level can add on as many of these extras as they like.

Or a Church! A Thieves\u2019 Guild! A Bard\u2019s College! Whichever you choose, it\u2019s your Domain. Your domain can take actions, raise armies, conduct espionage, and wage war!\nDifferent kinds of Domains have access to different actions. A Thieves\u2019 Guild is quite good at espionage, not so good at raising armies. So you may need allies! Because you will certainly have enemies!\nCharacters are still adventurers! But now the stakes are higher. Now the dragon threatens your people! And the dungeon contains the power you need to stop your enemies\u2019 schemes!\nWhile you\u2019re away; your Lieutenant runs your domain (by your command) allowing you to continue adventuring as normal. Or as normal as anything is in this game. :D\nThese new rules are broken down into three broad categories, described after the graphics below.\nThe Kickstater Exclusive Edition will have gold trim!\nThe text you see here will only be available for the  Kickstarter-exclusive shirt! We may make a future shirt with no back text, but for the Kickstarter, you get the exclusive Tour Shirt.\nAlso available as a $25 add-on in the pledge manager.\nAnd it comes in a red variant!\n Kingdoms, duchies, baronies, earldoms, any territory with people living on it can be your Domain. Domains can be a small province with a single town, or a sprawling kingdom with many cities. This book contains rules for starting with a single province and growing your domain, or starting the game at 1st level by inheriting an entire kingdom!\nThe system assumes that, regardless of how many different domains your campaign world might have, we\u2019re only worried about one Enemy Domain, one Allied Domain, and one Neutral Domain who could go either way. This constrains the number of things the GM needs to worry about so we don\u2019t need a computer to track all the different actors in our play. Of course, an ambitious GM could track more Kingdoms!\nDomain actions allow you to muster new units for your army, develop your land to get more resources out of it, build roads to make it easier to get around for people and armies, spy on your enemies, and ally with your neighbors.\nThe book includes rules and advice for running campaigns where only one player is a regent, all players are regents, or even how to use these rules to track the high-level politics in a game where no players are regents, and you just want the feel of large-scale political powers maneuvering against each other.\nNot every player wants to run a duchy or an earldom, but these rules give you many more kinds of Domains! Existing within, alongside, and sometimes at odds with a Kingdom, are Organizations like Churches, Thieves\u2019 Guilds, Wizard Orders, Bardic Colleges and more. All of them get special Domain Actions that affect the outcome of The Great Game.\nPaladin Order: The Green\nWizard's Order: The Arcanum Camerata\nAssassins College: Nine Silver\nOne player might run a thieves\u2019 guild, but sometimes the entire group wishes they could play a thieves\u2019 guild! Or an order of Monks! But while \u201clet\u2019s all play monks!\u201d sounds cool, once you sit down and think about it you realize that would mean no healing, no tank, no tracker, no one to pick locks or disarm traps or read arcane scrolls unless someone multiclasses, and was not as good at being a monk as everyone else, or played a different class and pretty soon you\u2019re back to playing a normal adventuring partzzzz\u2026..\nMaybe there\u2019s a better way.\nKingdoms and Warfare expands on the rules presented in the Chain of Acheron livestream with Titles for several different organizations.\nTitles give your characters new, limited abilities and proficiencies that let them shore up the deficiencies of a limited-class party.\nA thieves\u2019 guild might have a Godbotherer, a thief who gains proficiency with Religion and limited healing and possibly limited access to prayers. Not as powerful or useful or versatile as a cleric, but it gets the job done.\nAn order of Monks might have an Acolyte of Mystery, who gains proficiency with Arcana and access to limited spells. Or an Acolyte of Stone with increased AC and HP!\nOf course, some titles cannot be conferred during character creation, and must be earned like the Master of Ravens, the Master of Locusts, and the rest of the Monk Masters.\nExpanded rules for Warfare allowing faster, more balanced battles, more and different kinds of units. Pikemen who thwart Cavalry charges! Sappers who undermine fortifications! And more and better rules for Battle Magic; spells that affect units and the entire battlefield.\nNew Maneuvers allow characters to directly command their units, executing daring ploys that can change the course of war!\nNew rules for the Tide of Battle create a connection between the Encounter your characters are fighting and the Battle your units are waging. Doing well in the Encounter gives your army a boost! Doing well in Battle gives your characters an advantage! Of course, doing poorly has similarly predictable results\u2026.\nNew rules for using PCs and monsters as units, as well as more advice for building an army and waging war. The rules for Warfare in Strongholds & Followers are only the beginning of a more robust system.\nStrongholds & Followers  does not require the use of Kingdoms and Warfare; both strongholds and followers give players cool new abilities and allies all by themselves. But combining the two products produces a deeper system for running a world where characters can become Dukes or start their own Church, or run their own Thieves\u2019 Guild.\nWe listened to folks who bought Strongholds & Followers and made sure to put more of what they liked into Kingdoms & Warfare.\nNew Gemstone dragons! New servitors from each of the Courts presented in S&F and three new courts! The Court of Seven Cities (Devils), the Court of Blood (Demons) and the Court of Rot (Undead!) More better things to augment your concordance roll!\nThe monster design from S&F was pretty popular and we\u2019re super excited to do more. \nPLAY\n\nPeople loved the codicies from the first book, so we\u2019re doing more! The Codex Granatine! The Codex Adamant! The Codex Tempestatus! These legendary artifacts will change, or break, your game. Use at your peril!\nIncluding the legendary Codex Bellorum...the BOOK OF WAR.\nAny book of new rules as big as this requires an adventure to show you how to use it. The Regent of Bedegar acts as a sequel to the Siege of Castle Rend and introduces players to Domain Level play. The heroes manage their new domain, putting out fires in Gravesford and other local towns while encountering various organizations in Aendrim, some friendly, some not so much.\nOf course, there will be a battle at the end! Lord Saxton must pay for what he\u2019s done!\nLike Strongholds & Followers, this book uses my setting\u2019s background and lore, so you\u2019ll learn more about the Timescape, the lore of demons, devils, and undead, and more fiction featuring the young adventurers from the first book.\nAnd a Dragon!\nFolks really liked the gemstone dragons from the first kickstarter, so we're doing another one. The Ancient Onyx Dragon Cthrion Uroniziir!\nThis mini is BIG and only available to folks who back this Kickstarter. It will be available as an add-on in our Pledge Manager, but only to folks who pledge!\nIt\u2019s not \u201cCiv.\u201d It doesn\u2019t simulate an elaborate 4X game, it doesn\u2019t worry about stuff like...how much Iron you produce vs how much Wheat you need. Provinces produce \u201cresources.\u201d Alliances just boost those resources.\nIn general these rules focus on high-level play, heavily abstracted, married to crunchy rules that give your characters real mechanical benefits. If you\u2019re looking for a simulation this is not it.\nThe goal is; you\u2019re still playing Fifth Edition, but now your campaign has an extra dimension.\nIf we manage to reach our funding goal, we have a whole bunch of stretch goals planned. The book stays the same, but we unlock new play aids like a GM's Screen and a deck of unique unit cards for your fantasy warfare needs. \n The MCDM Screen\nA 4-panel screen for the discerning game master to fudge die rolls behind. Without a screen, you\u2019re just another random person at the table. With the screen, you become THE MASTER!\nOur screen gives you easy access to tables from Strongholds, Followers, Kingdoms, and Warfare including the list of Domain Actions, Random Domain Events, as well as the full list of actions that adjust your Concordance, making it easier to track.\nThe Unit Deck\nDozens of unique units with custom special abilities to use in your epic battles! Centaur shock troops! Goblin sappers! Beholder units! Dragon units! All printed on high-quality cards ready to be used immediately at your table.\n Dope Minis\nWe have a bunch of new monsters planned for Kingdoms & Warfare and we'd love to make minis out of all of them! Each stretch goal pays for the 3D model and the manufacturing mold. As we unlock new ones...IF we unlock new ones...you'll get to see the art and lore and how big the mini will be an how much it will cost. You'll be able to upgrade your pledge in our pledge manager to add any of the minis you like to your pledge.\nCheck back to see what (if anything!) gets unlocked!\n\nWe\u2019ll charge for shipping after the Kickstarter is over. We will collect this in the pledge manager.\nWe\u2019ll ship your rewards from one of the four Blackbox warehouses we work with. This project is US, Canada, and Australia friendly. Under current trade agreements, we are EU friendly. This may change pending future Brexit negotiations.\nBelow is a list of estimated shipping costs for the K&W Hardcover, PDF + Sticker pledge. Keep in mind that these are estimates and that the accurate costs will be calculated in the pledge manager according to your address, pledge level, and potential add-ons.\nWe don\u2019t ship to the following countries:\nAfghanistan, Brazil, Congo, Cote d\u2019Ivoire (Ivory Coast), Cuba, Democratic Republic of Congo, Eritrea, Guam, Guinea-Bissau, Haiti, Iran, Iraq, Liberia, Libya, Myanmar (Burma), North Korea, Russia, Somalia, South Africa, Sudan, Syria, Ukraine :(", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are many fewer risks associated with this product compared to Strongholds & Followers. We no longer print our books in China, so there\u2019s no danger of tariffs or trade interfering with our production. We have been through the Import Duty gauntlet so we have all the paperwork you need to ship your product around the world. We have good partners now, we know great artists, we have a great relationship with Trenchworx the folks who make our minis. \n\nLike Strongholds & Followers, these rules are based on rules I\u2019ve already designed before, so we\u2019re not creating an entire ruleset from whole cloth.\n\nI think probably the biggest risk is the fact that all of this revolves around me and my writing and design. Something happens to me, there could be a delay. But one of our goals with this project and the Player\u2019s Guide To Capital is finding other freelance writers and designers to work with under my direction so the product isn\u2019t wholly reliant on my labor.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 25 or more", "title": "Kingdoms & Warfare PDF", "descp": "Kingdoms & Warfare in an indexed, searchable PDF.

Wouldn't it be nice if they couldn't wait to play around in your world? If they were pushing you to spend more time in the land you create?\nThat's why I developed these downtime procedures over decades of play and now I can share it with you!\nWhat's in it? \nSystems that motivate players\nSimple usable procedures that work\nCreativity and inspiration for adventure\nNo longer will your players wonder what their characters should do with all their gold. It includes clear, common-sense rules for everything from starting a cult, making sacrifices to gods, to hiring mercenaries and building vehicles and castles.\nGoing to an arena fight? Take seconds to determine the purse, peruse mechanics to handle the arena crowd, pick some ideas for interesting arenas, and select an opponent like the Necrourge: a master of the dark arts of necrourgy, who raises the bodies of traitors or other criminals after they have been forced to fight in the arena and died. \nI've got a vision of usable downtime procedures that motivate players and provide inspiration to Dungeon Masters collected in a published volume. I want one for my table. But I don't have the funds to hire a cover artist. So I'm Kickstarting this to pay Skullfungus (\"I draw dungeons, their inhabitants and everything in between\") to create a beautiful cover. The book is written, layout is effectively complete, and nearly all of the interior art is finished. \nWhat's it for?\nThe downtime goals give agency to players, and let them build a dynasty. Imagine a group eager to explore your world because they have their own plans! These objective procedures give players tools that fire a desire to dive into your creative world, discover its detailed history, and make their mark on it.\nIt gives your players the tools to make their wildest ideas come to life, without breaking your campaign or your suspension of disbelief, all the while driving them to adventure in your world. On Downtime and Demesnes is filled with tools that work. Build a flying ship, enchant it; or build a wizards tower and raise fortifications in the surrounding lands. All with simple, scalable, rules. \nThis is a book used in every game you run. Your next campaign, the one after that, the one after that. . . Not one wasted word. Every page is crammed with content and creativity. No filler. Tools that let players build castles and control land, without disassociated mechanics. This is the stronghold book you've been looking for. \nCurious about the content? Check out the table of contents from the book. Want to see what's written? Back the project and read the art free PDF.\nWhat are the Details?\nThere are two versions, one for basic Dungeons & Dragons, compatible with classic games, and one for 5th edition games. I play both kinds of games, and I needed rules for this while running my megadungeon using Basic and Expert Dungeons & Dragons, as well as world-spanning campaigns using 5th edition Dungeons & Dragons. Both are A5 softcover, designed for portability and quick reference at the table. No one wants to lug around another hardcover to their local game. \nThis Kickstarter is also part of the Break Kickstarter promotion! Instead of providing stretch goals, you'll be going on a \"choose your own adventure\" by selecting different content for gaming creators to add to the book! Once the Kickstarter funds, find out the name of the first creative. At 1,500$, the backers will decide what they will add to the book, and we'll unveil the next creative on the list!\nStretch Goals\nWell that took off! \nEvery day, we are going to vote on new stretch goals. Will we unlock them all?\nWho am I?\nI'm an independent writer and artist, who's been producing gaming and gaming-related products for years. You've likely already read stuff I've written. My free book, Tricks, Traps, and Empty Room Design, has been downloaded hundreds of thousands of times; my blog Hack & Slash has been popular for years; and since I've gone full time, my high-level module Eyrie of the Dread Eye has nothing but five-star reviews.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is my first Kickstarter, but the work is written, the art and layout are mostly complete, and the stretch goals are small pieces (<2000 words) of bonus content. The layout can't be 'completely complete' until the stretch goal content is in, but I've been working with Indesign for over a decade now. I have finished products like this dozens of times, and consistently receive astounding 4.5+ star ratings on my products. \n\nI have a lot of experience working with DriveThruRPG to produce printed copies. I expect all the extra content (the color art for the cover and the articles by guest writers) to be complete within 6 weeks of project completion, and checking the print proofs for sale approval to take 6 weeks. This provides an extra 8 weeks as a buffer for issues and late content. I expect digital copies to be distributed in mid-October, and print copies to be available on DriveThruRPG by the end of November. \n\nI don't suffer from depression, and I am a productive person who is online frequently. I like to work. The fact that the project is nigh complete except for the cover, all bonus content is already planned and accounted for, and the only external systemic reliance is DriveThruRPG give me a great deal of confidence I can complete this project on time.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Peasant", "descp": "Get a digital copy of the draft of the book, vote on stretch goals, and follow the campaign updates!\nINCLUDES:\nAccess to a copy of the art-free draft of the book\nAbility to vote on stretch goals\nFollow comments and backer updates!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2019"}], "stat": ["172 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 15 or more", "title": "Citizen", "descp": "This gives you access to a digital copy of the final book!

We don't want studio execs shaking their heads and looking over our shoulders, we want these stories to come from the heart, a love letter from us to you.

Combining art, Dungeons and Dragons, and commerce, he formed his company Dwarven Forge in 1996, which has since become the gaming industry leader in the creation of miniature terrain and other fantasy sculptures. He has raised millions of dollars on Kickstarter for Dwarven Forge with the help of his legions of fans and is the subject of the documentary The Dwarvenaut, which premiered at SXSW in 2016. As an artist, he believes in travelling the world to see and experience all it has to offer in person.\nSatine Phoenix: \nGaming celebrity and former ambassador for D&D. About to go on a promotional tour of Europe for D&D.\nA consummate storyteller and lifelong creative, Satine Phoenix has always had a passion for building worlds and growing communities. She began filming Dungeons and Dragons games in 2009 which led to the inception of Celebrity Charity D20 with Keith Baker, a livestreamed gaming event benefiting Reach Out and Read. From there, she has worked on hundreds of Dungeons and Dragons events and is often called the \u2018Queen of D&D\u2019. Her impact on the tabletop community has been acknowledged in such publications as Forbes, Time Magazine, io9, and Maxim. Wherever the story leads her, Satine has proven time and again that the language of play is a universal one, bringing people together through the power of imagination.\n Josh Bishop: Award Winning Filmmaker\nAfter years of creating short form fiction and other content, Josh Bishop\u2019s first documentary feature Made In Japan, premiered at SXSW 2015 in Austin, Texas. It took the 2015 festival circuit by storm and won quite a few awards including Best Documentary at the Global Visons Film Festival and the Discovery Award for Best First Feature at the Calgary International Film Festival. Josh\u2019s sophomore documentary feature, The Dwarvenaut, premiered at SXSW 2016 and is available on most streaming platforms. Real stories and real human emotions are the heart of Josh\u2019s work.\nRon Harbin: Award Winning TV Producer\nIn 2000, Ron Harbin, a former Nashville music industry insider, found himself in the television production business. After a move to Santa Monica, he began traveling to exotic places with network specials and a variety of television series. Leading productions around the world for some of today\u2019s biggest shows has made him a highly sought-after producer.  Today, Ron\u2019s work is featured on Discovery, History, A&E, PBS, HGTV, CMT, along with many digital platforms.\nStretch goals\nOnce we lock picture on episode 1, there is only one strategy in mind for Destination Fantastic stretch goals; more episodes!\nThat's right, for every milestone we pass, another episode slides into the pipeline, beginning in New Zealand and continuing onward and outward for as long as your support sustains us. The New Zealand episode has already been prepped and scouted, and merely awaits the presence of our amazing explorers!  \nStefan and Satine will survey some of the key locations of the LOTR films on both the North and South islands, and will seek out the wily Peter Jackson himself to catch a glimpse into the process of fantasy filmmaking! A tour of the special effects studio WETA Workshop is also in store for our intrepid hosts!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe beauty of this project is that we have the first episode practically in the bag, and just need a little support nudging it over the finish line! Any subsequent stretch goal episodes you unlock will be added to the appropriate tiers at no additional cost!\n\nFrom Executive Producer Ron Harbin:\n\n\u2022 How are we going to spend all this money?\n\nI know that is the question on everyone\u2019s mind. 20 years ago, when I saw my first TV production budget, it blew my mind that a few frames of video could cost that much. I just thought you grab a camera and point it at the star and that was it. Boy! Was I ever wrong? After the producer revived me with some smelling salts and started to explain how the world worked, I understood and I think you will, too.\n\n\u2022 The people who are supported by your pledge.\n\nWhether it is the people you see on your screen or the people cleaning up after them, everyone has to get paid. And, more importantly, everyone deserves to get paid. The people who work on television and film productions are some of the hardest working and most dedicated people I know.\n\nThe hours are long and tiring. Riding a plane, bus, van, car, rickshaw, mule or whatever else you can think of, all while carrying enough equipment and tools to whittle a Tesla out of driftwood, takes its toll on the mind and the body. Sleeping in different time zone, every night, will lead to a level of confusion\u2026\u2026.what was I saying?\n\nWe stay gone for long periods of time and miss first days of school and birthday parties and bedtime stories. By the time we get back from one trip, it seems like it is time to leave on the next one. We kiss our kids and get back on the plane and the weird thing is\u2026most of us can\u2019t get enough. We love what we do and that is what keeps us going.\nAnd going. And going. And going.\n\n\u2022 Physical Production\n\nThe process of taking a cast and crew out into the world can get really expensive, really fast. Air travel, hotels, food and everyday expenses really start to add up when you\u2019re trekking across the globe for 2-3 weeks, at a time, especially if you\u2019re in an extreme or remote environment. Think about how much that last trip to Orlando cost you and the family!\n\nThe tools we use to make the show this beautiful do not come cheap, either. A travel based show needs to have equipment that can endure the elements (you may have seen a picture of me floating around where I am carrying a camera in the pouring rain on an Icelandic beach) while producing a high-quality image. Cameras, microphones, drones, hard drives, stabilizers, and more: if any of these items fail on the road, we can quickly find ourselves with no show. We want to show you the best, so we use the best.\n\n\u2022 Editing, Sound Editing, Post Production\n\nAfter we\u2019ve gone out into the world to shoot something amazing, an entirely new group of people gets involved to make sure everything looks and sounds as amazing as it did, in person. They want your experience, at home, to feel like you\u2019re there with us, on location. Not to mention, they usually catch (and fix) a few (*more than a few) mistakes made by yours truly!\n\nThe post production team is critical. We shoot dozens of hours of footage per episode, and believe me, you would tune out pretty quickly if you had to sit through all of it. Our post team works its special kind of magic to make sure that the show we end up with is the snappy, compelling, beautiful, crazy, nerdy, rock \u2018n roll travel adventure that we set out to bring to you.\n\n\u2022 Kickstarter\n\nAnd that\u2019s just the \u2018How to Pay for A Television Series\u2019 part of the story. \n\nThen, there is the \u2018How Much Does Running a Kickstarter Campaign Cost\u2019 part. \n\nWell\u2026let me tell you. That is where it gets really interesting. The short answer, though, is\u2026a lot! Kickstarter is an important platform in the independent business world. They, too, deserve our support. There are fees associated with running a campaign and, combined with credit card fees, total about 8% of the total amount raised. Add that to the cost of producing and sending all of our backers the fantastic rewards we have created and that means about $.35 out of every dollar is already spent the moment our campaign reaches its funding goal.\n\nAdd this all up and I promise you, the money you provide to help this production is well cared for and will be spent as responsibly as possible. Our goal is always to deliver the best product imaginable and as much of it as we possibly can. We appreciate the trust you have placed in us, by pledging your support, and we refuse to let you down.\n\nThank you,\n\nRon Harbin\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 3 or more", "title": "Onlookers", "descp": "You're helping us put art into the world!\nA heartfelt hank you + EXCLUSIVE INFO UPDATES, behind-the-scenes access, videos, and more!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2019"}], "stat": ["82 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "Friends of the Realm", "descp": "An astounding digital postcard of our Iceland adventures!\nPlus a heartfelt thank you + EXCLUSIVE INFO UPDATES, behind-the-scenes access, videos, and more!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2019"}], "stat": ["35 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 15 or more", "title": "Nomad", "descp": "The HD digital edition of Episode One of Destination Fantastic, the Iceland Excursion!

SINGLE. MONTH. In fact...\nIt's not a \"magazine\"... it's a monthly expansion BOOK!\nIf you never experience the old RPG mags, they were more than just a collection of articles. The old magazines were expansion sets and rules supplements and they were PACKED with content.\nEach issue is like getting a NEW jam-packed full-sized Fifth Edition supplement in the mail.\n Full-length adventures. Never run out of campaign material with playtested, full-length adventures for all levels.\n Sub-classes. Add variety to your game with brand new sub-classes for all class levels.\n Monsters. Need more challenges? Look no further than brand new monsters with full stats and ecological notes.\n Spells, Magic Items, Rules Supplement and more! There's so much content that all of it could exist in a book by itself.\nDigital mockup of what the first issue will look like.\nEach dynamic issue of BroadSword Magazine includes four NEW and ORIGINAL Fifth-Edition compatible adventures, plus new monsters, races, subclasses, magic items, and more every month in both print and digital PDF formats.\nBroadsword operates under the Fifth Edition Open License Agreement, meaning that the game is FULLY compatible with modern Fifth Edition rules of \"the world's most popular roleplaying game.\"\nSo expect to see plenty of ancient dragons while you're exploring lots of dungeons!\nHere is the tentative table of contents for BroadSword magazine #1.\nAdventures \nThe Secret of Forsaken Peak Cross Section\nFeature - The Secret of Forsaken Peak Part 1 (The Goblin Mine) by Dave Hamrick and Justin David Russell. The goblins of Forsaken Peak have been acting up lately. You're tasked by your patron (five different options with five different goals) to investigate what they're up to. This is the first part of The Secret of Forsaken Peak megadelve adventure path, set for a group of 5th-level characters.\nBonus - The Secret of Forsaken Peak Castle of Chaos Detail by Dave Hamrick and Justin David Russell. Need a place for your characters to rest in between delves? The Castle of Chaos is the perfect spot. Well, if you ignore the fact that it's managed by a bunch of insane people, that is.\nThe Battle of Dragard Mine by Dave Hamrick and Justin David Russell. The residents of Dragard Mine discovered something important in the old mountain. Whatever it is, the Beastmen of Kalibar want to get their claws on it.  Dragard Mine is an adventure for a group of 11th-level characters and uses Dave Hamrick's original mass combat rules system.\nComes with a double-sided fold out map of Dragard Mine.\nEvadimus's School for Gifted Spellcasters by Dave Hamrick and Justin David Russell. How do wizards learn their first spells? At wizardry school, of course! One of the most famous of these schools is Evadimus' School for Gifted Spellcasters. This adventure is for 0-level characters that takes wizards-to-be from commoner to 1st-level caster over the course of a school year.\nTrial of Heroes by Dave Hamrick. Every year, the lords of South Castle come together to test adventurers all over the land; not for their sheer might and power, but for their ability to think and work as a team. The Trial of Heroes follows the tradition of RPG magazines of offering up level-agnostic challenges for characters of any level.\nOne-Shot Adventure by Dave Hamrick. A one-shot adventure in the vein of the old \"Side Treks\" articles that'll work as a nice little side quest. Theme and plot too-be-determined, although it will be centered around 2nd-level characters.\nArticles\nHow to Keep Your Players Engaged by Dave Hamrick. You know the situation: you're explaining an awesome landscape or a tense battle and for whatever reason you can't seem to get your players' attention. Either they're looking at their phones, chatting it up, or just off in la-la-land. Dave Hamrick explains how he keeps his characters engaged in his games and shares some tips on how you can get your players engaged, too.\nRules Supplements\n10 New Cantrips by Dave Hamrick. Everyone has that one or two favorite cantrip that they love to use frequently. But in the end, there isn't a whole lot of variety when it comes to cantrip. Dave Hamrick offers up 10 more cantrips for characters to use.\nMass Combat Basics by Dave Hamrick. To accompany the Battle of Draggard Mine adventure, Dave Hamrick's crafted a full set of easy-to-use mass combat rules that capture the feel of Fifth Edition and lets characters be heroes on wider level.\nNew Playable Race: Laicosts (Mousefolk) by Dave Hamrick. A DMDave classic, laicosts are scallywag mouselike humanoids that stay in tight knit communities. The article will expand on their world and introduce the playable mousefolk.\nTraps & Puzzles Featurette by Dave Hamrick. Need some non-combat challenges for your dungeon encounters? The Traps & Puzzles featurette helps you do just that. \n3 New Arcane Subclasses by Dave Hamrick. The first stretch goal hit for the project was opening up three new subclasses. These subclasses are Wizard Teacher Arcane Tradition, Madness Sorcererous Origin, and Warlock Patron of Forbidden Lore.\n2 New Subclasses by Dave Hamrick. Another stretch goal opened up two new subclasses. These are as-of-yet undetermined, but will probably be related to Forsaken Peak.\n3 Mass Combat Feats by Dave Hamrick. The second stretch goal hit opens up new feats for mass combat campaigns. These will coincide with the mass combat rules.\nMonsters by Jack by Jack Hamrick & TBD. My son Jack draws a monster and artists bring it to life.\n7 New Uncommon Magic Items by Dave Hamrick. This was a bonus stretch goal--I'll be creating 7 uncommon magic items for you to put into your campaign.\n10 New Monsters by Dave Hamrick. More monsters! Already, I have a library of hundreds of monsters on DMDave. What's 10 more?\nRandom Wilderness Tables by Dave Hamrick. Need some ideas for wilderness dressing? This chart of 100 random wilderness encounter will help spice up your adventures.\nDouble-Sided Poster by Justin David Russell. The front cover art and the map for Dragard Mine will be featured on this amazing, high-quality double-sided poster.\nAnd more...\nWith each stretch goal, more content will be added to this already-awesome list. Keep an eye out here on the Kickstarter page as well as communications to see what's coming down the pipe for the first issue of BroadSword Magazine. \nThe best part? The first adventure is already penned and ready to go and the other three adventures are in final draft stages. You can read the original draft on DMDave's website.\nThe Goblin Mine, the first part of The Secret of Forsaken Peak.\nThat means that as soon as you sign on to this Kickstarter, you can get a digital copy of the first adventure, The Secret of Forsaken Peak: The Goblin Mine by Dave Hamrick and Justin David Russell. It's the first part of a HUGE megadelve adventure path that will be included in the magazine.\nWe're nuts for the classic RPG 'zines of the '80s and '90s. \nHowever,  it costs quite a bit to create a high-quality magazine, thick with original art and solid, playtested rules, all compatible with 5th edition. \nPrinting a magazine like this takes some serious capital. That's why we're Kickstarting it. We want to make sure we have the funding necessary for print runs tiny to gargantuan.\nAnd we don't want to cheapen it. While the magazine will intentionally have an old-school-vibe to it (black-and-white interior, pen/ink illustrations, etc.) it will still be printed on the highest quality paper available with perfect binding. \n\"So what's up with BroadSword magazine beyond the first issue? And why should I be excited about it (aka, why should I pay for 12-months of issues?)\"\nGreat question! Here's what you should look forward to with the magazine:\n1) Issues #2 - #6 are already mostly planned out. While we've still got a few nitty gritty details to plan on, here is the \"themes\" for the issues following #1:\n Issue #2 - Horror. To coincide with Halloween, BroadSword will have adventures, articles, and supplements geared around horror stories and monsters.\n Issue #3 - Science fiction. New rules for science fiction along with an accompanying adventure.\n Issue #4 - Winter. Winter based adventures, holidays, and more.\n Issue #5 - Downtime+. Downtime is a cool feature of Fifth Edition, but kinda falls apart at higher levels. The adventures and articles in this issue will address this problem.\n Issue #6 - Gear. Looking for cool, new items for your characters or NPCs? This issue will feature cool weapons, magic items, and more and adventures to compliment them.\n2) We're taking submissions for issues #2 and up. As much as I love creating content, to ensure that we can work on a tight schedule, we will be taking submissions from other creators in the community. This includes artists, adventure-crafted, article-writers, and even homebrewers. And we're paying for the content!\n3) DMDave has 500,000+ words worth of content to fall back on. Worst case scenario (somehow, no one on earth submits anything), we still have 7 months worth of content to fall back on with DMDave.com. That's nearly 600 articles and 500,000+ words worth of original Fifth Edition content.\n4) Multiple Printer Sources. We have three different printers ready to go (include, two of which are associated directly with the business) to print issues in advance. There will be no logistical snafus to slow down printing. And even if there are, we'll be sure to communicate.\n5) Total transparency. Subscribers of the magazine will have full transparency of all the forthcoming content. You'll be able to see what's going on and even offer input either on DMDave.com, our social media accounts, the official BroadSword discord channel and more.\n6) Experience & Research. I have been in ecommerce for nearly a decade. In addition to experience serving customers online, I have done plenty of research and worked closely with other publishers to ensure that any issue that could come up is addressed ahead of time.\nWe're 100% invested in this project and want to make sure that it succeeds.  \nNow it wouldn't be a fun Kickstarter if we didn't have a whole mess of Stretch Goals to offer, too, now would it?\nHere is what you can expect to get along with the magazine should we match these goals: \nMore to come!\nWe know that not everyone is a \"grognard\" like JD and I. That's why this book is not only available in Print format, but Digital format (PDF) as well.\nAs we noted above, the adventure is already completed and ready as both a FREE \"blog\" version which you can read now and a \"preview\" version which you'll receive after the Kickstarter ends. However, the finalized PDF for the magazine will have all new art, get a thorough playtesting analysis, and come with a lot more bonus content. \nPlus we'll partner with other companies and use their experience in digital production to make sure that the finished products are 100% perfecto.\nOne of the most exciting things about BroadSword magazine is that it features the outstanding art of world-class old-school artist Justin David Russell (Epic Werkes Studio). JD is a traditional illustrator, using pen/ink and oil paints to make his creations. \nCheck out some of his art below:\nThe cover art to BroadSword #1/The Secret of Forsaken Peak\nDid I mention that there might be some DRAGONS in DUNGEONS? ;)\n\"Sorry, laddie, but yeh won't be a-tossin' THIS dwarf!\"\nA recent image by JDR, a warrior stumbles upon something... scaly.\nWhat's this pigman? That's how JDR draws goblins!\nThis time, we're offering both preview and playtest material for those who want to try the content out before its official launch.\n What's the difference between the two? \nA playtest involves running at least one of the adventures. Playtesters are acknowledged in the magazine's credits, and have a real say in the difficulty, balance, and playability of the final creation. We'll send backers information on how to sign up.\nA preview just means an early look, without providing any formal feedback and without a listing in the credits. No signup or reports required.\nEveryone who pledges at the $10 level or more gets a FREE copy of Broadsword Magazine preview.\nHere is what you can expect from each of the pledge levels.\n Supporter - You just love us and want to show your support. Awwwww, thanks! :)\n Broadsword #1 PDF only - You just want to read it and print the magazine at your leisure. This pledge level is only $10 and includes all the cool DMDave/JDRussell content.\n Broadsword #1 Print and PDF - You want to get the first issue of Broadsword in a print-ready PDF format as well as the printed collector's copy. This pledge level is only $15 and will include all stretch goals.\n Broadsword 3-Month Subscription (Print & PDF) - You want to see what's up with the first three issues of Broadsword magazine in both printed and PDF format. This pledge level is only $42 (you save $1 per issue) and includes all stretch goals.\n Broadsword 6-Month Subscription (Print & PDF) - You're down with Broadsword and want to see the first six issues of this milestone series in both printed and PDF format. This pledge level is only $84 and includes all stretch goals (you save $1 per issue).\n Broadsword 12-Month Subscription (Print & PDF) - You're so enthusiastic about Broadsword, you want the first twelve issues of the mag coming straight to your inbox and mailbox. This pledge level is $144 and includes all stretch goals (you save $3 per issue).\nWe're launching Broadsword Magazine with options for advertisers, too!\nJust like the old RPG magazines, we plan on doing some throwback ads both on the rear and interior covers, as well as four pages at the rear of the magazine, and a center insert with smaller ads (kinda like a \"trading post\").\nWhat's a throwback ad?\nBlack-and-white, artwork of questionable integrity, etc. You may even reference your fancy, new fangled world-wide-web webpage on the interwebs. \nEven though these \"website\" things sound like a fad. Obviously.\nWhat do ads cost?\nAd prices are fixed right now, meaning no matter how many people jump on this Kickstarter, we're going to keep the rate the same for the first issue. \nThat means your ad could be seen by thousands of qualified shoppers for an extremely low rate (cheaper than newspaper ads, but with a more targeted marketing).\nFor those who are worried about too many ads, don't worry. These ads are mostly for fun to add to the old school vibe. The kitschier, the better! Plus, we're only giving up 5% of the entire magazine for this ad space.\nHere are the current ad tiers:\n Full-page/full-color advertisement (only 3 available). These advertisements will be printed on the back of the magazine cover and on the interior covers just like in the old school magazines. Starts at $300. Plus, you get one month of advertising on DMDave.com (100,000 impressions per month), newsletter mentions, plus Instagram and Facebook shoutouts.\n Full-page/black-and-white advertisement (only 4 available). These advertisements will appear in the back of the magazine on the last 4 pages. Starts at $225. Plus, you get one month of advertising on DMDave.com (100,000 impressions per month), newsletter mentions, plus Instagram and Facebook shoutouts.\n 2.5\" by 4.75\" advertisement (Black/White) (only 40 available). These small ads will appear throughout the magazine, again adding to the \"old school vibe\" of Broadsword. Starts at $40. Plus, you get 8,000 impressions on DMDave.com.\n\nPlus, all advertisers get a PDF copy and physical of Broadsword #1!\nEven if you don't have a business, you can use the ad to say thanks! Or give a shoutout to somebody you love, or even propose to JD Russell.\nAd-Ons for Additional Issues\nSome of you have expressed interest in getting both an add and the full subscription plan. Here's how you can do it:\n1) Select the advertising plan that you want to do.\n2) Adjust your pledge amount up by one of the following subscription plans (it already includes the first issue):\n3-month subscription: +$36 (includes shipping, US only)\n6-month subscription: +$87 (includes shipping, US only)\n12-month subscription: +$165 (includes shipping, US only)\n3) Email me at hamrickbrands@gmail.com or contact me via Instagram to confirm your intention.\nFor details on how to do all this, here's a guide for add-ons: How to Do Add-Ons\nSo who are the creative nut jobs behind this incredible project? Here are the folks involved in the creation of Broadsword Magazine: \nJustin David Russell (Epic Werkes Studios), Artist and Creator is also a grognard roleplayer, having played just as long (if not longer). He's the creator of the The Forsaken Peak adventure path's setting, the illustrator of all the maps, interior artwork, and cover illustrations for Broadsword magazine. He's one of the hardest working illustrators in the roleplaying world today.  You can see his artwork above.\nDave Hamrick, Designer and Publisher has been a roleplayer and GM for nearly 28 years. He's also a full time writer and author, business owner, and game designer. He's the guy that maintains DMDave.com and writes most of the material for it (over 500 articles with nearly 1,000,000 words of original Fifth Edition content), including all adventures in the first issue of Broadsword magazine. This isn't his first rodeo, either. He's owned an Amazon business for four years as well as multiple digital media sites and has countless contacts in both the game and product fulfillment industry.\nStill not sold? Check out what folks have to say about our content:\n\"Amazing content and takes into careful consideration all mechanics and lore surrounding not just 5e but prior editions.\" - Facebook fan\n\"Great Content. Good ideas and monster creation.\" - Facebook fan\n\"Keep up the great work, DMDave, really enjoy all your creations!\" - Patreon fan\nRegarding the launch of BroadSword magazine:\n\"Cool! This sounds awesome and I\u2019m looking forward to checking it out when it goes live. Always looking for 5e adventures done in the vein of old Dungeon Magazine.\" - Kickstarter Follower\n\"Yes, and yes. Did I say yes? Yes I did.\" - Kickstarter Follower\n\"I\u2019m super pumped for this can\u2019t wait I\u2019ll definitely be get the year subscription on launch.\" - Kickstarter Follower\nFrom Kickstarter Backers:\n\"I have a 0% chance to be able to write/edit/make something like this happen but for the last year or so I have been hoping that SOMEONE would make a magazine similar to Dungeon. I am just a print kind of guy, PDFs don't do it for me.\" - Kickstarter Backer\n\"Thank you and I'm excited about this. I was a very long-time subscriber to Dragon, Dungeon, and Kobold Quarterly so this is exactly what I've been waiting for!\" - Kickstarter Backer\n20,500 + Followers on Instagam (with a 20%+ engagement rate)", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe entire magazine is drafted and ready. We've sourced the costs with manufacturers and they're just waiting for our final art. The only thing missing are the commissions and backer elements as well as any necessary adjustments from playtesting. All of the interior cartography is completed as well as is the cover art and most of the interior art. However, there's still a little work to do in art, adding in any extra details, playtesting, editing, and development, not to mention layouts and final designs.\n\nHowever, Dave Hamrick, the lead designer has been a professional game and product designer and fulfillment specialist for four years. He already owns his own Amazon business and has an extremely popular website with 150,000+ monthly viewers. Plus, he has multiple contacts in the book industry and China and a printer is already lined up with deposits pre-placed. In addition, he's working closely with veterans of Kickstarter projects, with over 5 projects between them. Finally, he writes for a company that specializes in product development and design with over 100 employees. All of these experts are assisting in consultation on the product to ensure success of the Kickstarter itself and its subsequent fulfillment.\n\nFor future issues, submissions will be accepted to ensure regular content and DMDave has nearly 600+ original articles on his site to pull from if need be (including a ton of previously unreleased articles). \n\nPlus, we're giving ourselves 4-5 months before the first issue to create the first six issues' worth of content. Our printers are already prepared for monthly editions and will have proofs/artwork/etc in their hands 2-3 months in advance of printing. Any hiccups in transport, content creation, etc. will be communicated to all subscribers in advance so if there are any problems subscribers will have plenty of advance notice. If the magazine ends for any reason, any outstanding fees will be returned to subscribers in a pro-rated format.\n\nThere are no additional projects on the table. This is it. Nothing to get in the way or screw up logistics.\n\nWe require no external review or approval from other companies to make this magazine happen, and we've been working on it long enough to see it is coming together well.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Support the Project", "descp": "You get the project news and updates, and your name gets mentioned in our acknowledgements section.

Short of a major catastrophe, we expect a very successful Lexicon 2019. The real question is how big will it be? \nAmong the things we have learned is to get the contracts in place as soon as possible to make sure individual events and convention enhancements happen successfully. Of course we have no control over the hotel if they make an error and there is a problem with the space; we apologize if a GM or a special guest does not show up for an event, we will do our best to find someone to take their place. Some events will become full, since we focus so much on having a large variety of events, rather than multiple versions of the same event, if this happens early, we will try to schedule additional sessions, but can not guarantee entry into any events.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "Mike/Eleven Level", "descp": "Kid's Weekend Badge ages 6 to 12 (under 6 is free).

Grimtooth the Troll here. You sorry souls have been dying from my traps for decades. And in all that time, not one of you miniscule mortals has attacked me in my lair! Well, I\u2019ve decided to take pity on you. For the first time ever, I\u2019m going to show you my realm. You\u2019ll finally get to see \u2013 Trapsylvania!\nThis Kickstarter supports the publication of Grimtooth\u2019s Trapsylvania, a 144-page campaign setting and sourcebook! It will be available in print (softcover or hardcover) and electronic (PDF) format. It is fully illustrated, with color cover and B/W interior art. The publisher is Goodman Games, under license from Flying Buffalo. The book is written in a systems-neutral style like all Grimtooth books, with DCC RPG stats compiled in an appendix at the back.\nGrimtooth's Lair\nThis Kickstarter also offers a rare collectible treasure: the \"lost 8th Grimtooth book.\" Flying Buffalo published a total of 7 Grimtooth books. At the Origins Game Convention in 1983, an independent publisher released their own unauthorized bootleg adventure called Grimtooth's Lair. Today, only a single copy of this adventure is known to exist. Thanks to collector Bill Meinhardt, we have been able to scan the adventure for publication. It is being offered as an add-on for this Kickstarter (see below).\nThe only known copy of Grimtooth's Lair - now available as a reprint exclusively through this Kickstarter!\nAt last \u2013 the legendary locations of Grimtooth\u2019s Traps revealed!\nFor over 30 years, Grimtooth\u2019s numerous Traps books have horrified players and inspired game masters with hundreds of dangerous devices, deadly deathtraps and hilarious hijinx! Now Grimtooth (with a little help from kid sister Grimtina) will take you on a personally guided tour of his realm and the central hub of his vast Traps empire.\nRun your own Grimtooth campaign, or pick and choose locations you can use in your own adventures. Explore Grimtooth\u2019s caverns, visit his Inner Sanctum, escape the Deathmaze Testing Center, attend Warthog\u2019s School for Trolls, take a ride on Grimtooth\u2019s Airship, tour Grimtina\u2019s Petting Zoo or get lost in many more gigantic places of doom, like the Infinite Corridor of Hallways. Each of these infamous locations includes maps, descriptions, non-player character details, scenarios, and lots of art. Plus there are more traps (of course) and plenty of things with which to endanger your characters.  \nLike all Grimtooth books, Grimtooth\u2019s Trapsylvania is written in a systems-neutral format, and published in a way that it is fully compatible with the Dungeon Crawl Classics Role Playing Game (DCC RPG). A series of appendices at the back provide quick and easy stats for DCC RPG games, covering all the creatures, characters and items described in the book. It\u2019s very easy to fill a graveyard with the corpses of your DCC player characters! (Because once you enter Trapsylvania \u2013 you won\u2019t leave! Suckers.)  \nTrapsylvania is written and illustrated by S. S. Crompton, the legendary \u201cvoice of Grimtooth\u201d who has been working on Grimtooth products for Flying Buffalo for more than 30 years. We\u2019ve rounded up the entire roster of historical Grimtooth contributors to illustrate the book, so you\u2019ll find art not just by S. S. Crompton, but also by Liz Danforth, Micheal Von Glahn, Scott Jackson Phil Longmeier, and Jeff Dee \u2013 all the artists who have contributed to Grimtooth products over the years! The new traps are written by Grimtooth alumni S. S. Crompton, Ken St. Andre, Bear Peters, Rick Loomis, Paul O'Connor and Debora Kerr. The DCC stats are provided by Terry Olson, with editing by Jen Brinkman.\nTrapsylvania is chock full of useful gaming material! How much is there? Well, here's the exact count!\n1 whole country! (Grimtooth's, that is!)\n15 large locations, all described and mapped\n48 scenario ideas\n60 traps or trapped items\n86 creatures (with DCC stats in the Appendix)\n26 NPCs (with DCC stats in the Appendix)\n23 items (with DCC stats in the Appendix)\nAnd loads of laughs!\nWhat is Grimtooth\u2019s Traps?\nOriginally published by Flying Buffalo, Grimtooth\u2019s Traps is one of the most popular RPG accessories ever produced, with more than 250,000 copies in print since 1981. Flying Buffalo published seven Grimtooth\u2019s books, all of them usable with any RPG. In 2015, Goodman Games compiled all of these into a massive hardcover compilation, and also published two additional DCC-compatible Grimtooth adventures. Grimtooth remains an eternally relevant character and his popularity has only grown since then.\nThe hallmarks of Grimtooth-style traps are wacky humor combined with deadly danger, plus, of course, extremely useful material that can be integrated into any dungeon-crawling RPG!\nWhat\u2019s in the book?\nEverything you need to run a game in Trapsylvania! Whether a single session or an extended campaign, you can give your players a fun time. Here is a preview of the Table of Contents:\nWhat's the Status of the Book?\nTrapsylvania is written, edited, illustrated, and laid out. We are in final proofreading stages at the time of the Kickstarter. It will be ready to go to the printer shortly after this Kickstarter ends.\nPledge Levels and Shipping\nThe basic pledge levels are for a PDF, softcover, or hardcover edition of the 144-page Trapsylvania. \nWe are also offering a leather-bound edition. We have 50 copies that will also include a piece of original art by Steve Crompton. The remainder do not include that original art.\nShipping costs are as follows. International shipping is via Priority Mail International. The good news is this means international packages will arrive very quickly, but due to recent rate changes these charges unfortunately must be more more than we have charged in the past.\nUSA: softcover $6.00, hardcover $7.00, both books $8.00. \nCanada: softcover $15.00, hardcover $20.00, both books $25.00.\nUK and EU: softcover $20.00, hardcover $25.00, both books $30.00.\nAustralia and rest of world: softcover $25.00, hardcover $30.00, both books $35.00.\nIf you add on items, please use the \"both books\" shipping - i.e. add +$5 for additional shipping cost. The additional $5 is a flat fee whether you add one book or many.\nStretch Goals\nThe last time Grimtooth ran a Kickstarter, it took off like wildfire. (I love fire!! \u2013 Grimtooth) This time around, we want to keep the Kickstarter simple and easy to fulfill. But we\u2019re still adding a couple stretch goals in case you humans want to throw even more gold at Grimtooth!\nAt $20,000, the books will have fancy printed endsheets! CLEARED!\nAt $40,000, we will include a poster map of Trapsylvania! CLEARED!\nAt $45,000, we will include a new Grimtooth mini-comic by Steve Crompton! CLEARED!\nAt $50,000 we will include cards featuring NPC portraits and stats! CLEARED!\nAnd above that, we have other ideas. Grimtooth said he wants a sticker with his face on it, and a poster map of his airship, plus scenic postcards that can double as player handouts, an art print, and more!\nAdd-On Items\nGoodman Games has published many RPG products, including quite a few that are perfect additions to this project! You can add on additional funds to include these items.

The adventurers must wend their way through a maze of traps in Grimtooth\u2019s Museum of Death, a curated collection of the deadliest and most devious traps ever assembled in one place. Along the way, they might even cross paths with a few of Grimtooth\u2019s allies: Grimtina, Spike the Grimdog, and Sludgeworth. Tread lightly, delver. There are no refunds for this tour!\nGrimtooth\u2019s Tomb of the Warhammer ($10.00): A level 4 Grimtooth adventure compatible with DCC RPG. Written by Tunnels & Trolls creator Ken St. Andre. Can you go where no troll dares to tread? Long ago, the elves killed Grimtooth\u2019s father in a great battle. They hid the troll leader\u2019s body and his mystic warhammer somewhere in the vast plains beyond Trapsylvania. After years of searching, Grimtooth has finally located his father\u2019s tomb, but the elves have magically rigged it so that no troll can enter. Now Grimtooth is looking for a party of foolhardy adventurers to enter Grimfang\u2019s Tomb and return with the legendary warhammer\u2026 \nDungeon Crawl Classics Role Playing Game: The core rulebook for the most popular old-school RPG on the market today!

Raise armies! Research spells! Spy on your enemies! \nThis is a book!\nWe\u2019re printing a book and we need money for art and layout and printing costs. The core release is 128 pages, hardcover, but the content and page count increase with each stretch goal! \nThat means the book you order just gets more content as more people pledge. It grows! \nA Style Of Play\nMore than just a set of rules and charts, this book also describes a style of play that assumes your character becomes more interested in influencing the world around them. You\u2019ll still adventure and fight monsters, but this supplement gives you tons of fun things to do during your downtime. \nMaybe only one or two players in any group are interested in this sort of thing, but it only takes one character building a stronghold to radically change the nature of a campaign and introduce new narrative opportunities for DM and players alike! Huge new story opportunities arise! This book includes tons of examples for DMs to inspire them. \nIn addition to the pledge level bundles, you will be able to add-on extra goodies in the pledge manager after the Kickstarter!  You want two copies of the book, you got it!  You want to add the littlest dragon, you got it!  Check out the individual prices below.\nThe Kickstarter Exclusive edition will be swanky.\n(this is a mock-up, not final)\n Also the shirt will be swanky. The text you see here will only be available for the Kickstarter-exclusive shirt! We'll make more shirts later with different (and no) text, but for the kickstarter, you get the Earth Elemental.\nThis product will not turn your game into a 4X game, or an RTS. It grants new character options and opens the game up to a more political arena where nearby local powers, both good and evil, take an interest in the PCs and what they\u2019re up to. Nor is this product about buying 10\u2019 squares of wall or individual doors. You don\u2019t create a PC by buying organs! \nKeeps let you raise armies, and the rules include a new, basic version of my forthcoming Warfare rules.  \nTowers let you conduct spell research. \nTemples let you buff armies and towns. \nEstablishments generate revenue and gather intelligence on your neighbors. \nFounding a Stronghold enhances one of your class abilities! A Paladin gets an improved Divine Smite, a Bard gets an improved Inspiration. The improvement is temporary through, requiring the character to return home if they want to refresh their cool new ability. Gives PCs a reason to go home! \nOnce your stronghold is built, you get to roll on the followers chart! Local people hear about your new stronghold and, already impressed by your heroic deeds at lower-level, arrive to pledge service. You might attract\u2026 \nA mercenary company or displaced soldiers from a recently lost battle arrive and pledge service! You\u2019ve got a very tiny army! The book comes with the basic version of my Warfare rules designed to sit on top of normal encounters. \nLower-level heroes who pledge service and can be sent out into the world to do your bidding! Includes a Questing system, and optional rules for taking your adventuring followers with you without slowing everything down because you\u2019re running multiple characters. \nBlacksmiths, farmers, scribes, tailors. All grant you or your stronghold some new ability. And! Many of them can make magic items for you! \nHarvest Monster Bits, Make Magic Items \nBring your scribe the heart of a dragon, and they can make scrolls of protection against dragons! Bring your alchemist the brain of a Mind Flayer, and they can make potions of Mind Flayer control! Your blacksmith (with a wizard\u2019s help) can make Arrows of Slaying! Swords with extra bonuses vs monster types! My group has been using a variation of these rules for over 30 years! \nAn emissary from a nearby Orc tribe arrives to establish an alliance. Now you can buy Orc units! And, of course, an alliance with the Orcs or Elves or Dwarves comes with all sorts of interesting political ramifications. \nPowerful nearby entities like what you\u2019re doing and want to help. Dragons, Giants, even Demons and Angels depending on your character\u2019s alignment! They\u2019re far too powerful and proud to do your bidding, but they might help out at a critical moment or deliver important news and advice about the greater world and other planes of existence! Plus, players think having a Dragon as an Ally is cooool. It might even let you ride it! I mean, probably not, but maybe! \nYou can download an early version of the Paladin's Follower Chart here!\nEvery stretch goal listed below adds content to the hardcover Strongholds & Followers book at no extra charge. Your $30 pledge just gets you more book, as more people pledge. \nBecause the other goal of this kickstarter is to raise money to cover the lease on studio space for us to stream our next game starting with character creation! I\u2019ve already spent several thousand dollars on gear, we just don\u2019t have any space to stream and we have very specific requirements. No, your garage won\u2019t do. No, your living room isn\u2019t big enough. :D We\u2019re basically building a TV Studio. \nSince finding studio space means signing a multi-year lease and being on the hook for a lot of money, it terrifies me. It\u2019s my hope that enough people want this book, or want to support the stream, to cover some or all of that cost. If not, no big deal. You still get a great book! \nThe first stretch goal is the most exciting. We\u2019re going to add a third category of dragon to the game, the neutral Gemstone Dragons. Five new dragon types, Amethyst, Emerald, Topaz, Sapphire, and Ruby. These dragons focus more on lore, knowledge, magic, and even psionics, than their chromatic or metallic counterparts. Depending on your alignment, and how well you roll on your classes\u2019 Follower Chart, you may end up with a Gemstone Dragon Ally! \nThese dragons get complete write-ups across several age categories so you can also use them as monsters if you so wish. \nMinis! \nI started in the tabletop business, producing a book is not an entirely new experience for me, but I\u2019ve never made miniatures before and I\u2019m super excited to give it a shot! We\u2019ve already got artists and modelers and manufacturer\u2019s lined up.  Here's the concept art for an Adult Ruby Dragon from my friend Anthony Sixto;\nGemstone Dragons are born as flesh creatures, but grow more crystalline as they age, until the oldest, the Ancients, which are entirely crystal. \nIf we reach this stretch goal, we unlock new pledge options that let you buy one of the five dragon types, or all five! \nWe\u2019re making; \nA Topaz Dragon Wyrmling - A wee dragon! Great for an special animal companion. \nA Young Emerald Dragon - About as big as a horse. \nAn Adult Amethyst Dragon - Big and impressive! \nAn Adult Ruby Dragon (above) - Equally big! Master of mysticism! \nAn Ancient Sapphire Dragon - Even bigger and fully crystalline in form. \nNote that the minis are normal opaque plastic, just with crystalline shape. \n~20 pages of new items, including several codices, tomes of powerful magic that bend reality and grant those who carry them great power. A Wizard who builds a Tower always knows where the nearest codex is, so we need some codices! \nHere's an early draft of the codex terragnosis. Found and used by Salar Bearmantle in my last game!\nIn addition to codices, new items that affect your stronghold, or require being permanently installed in a stronghold are included. \nExplore the ruins of...either an ancient Keep or an abandoned Wizard\u2019s Tower, I haven\u2019t decided which. Then restore it and make it your base of operations! This adventure presents the clearest, most straightforward way to use this book, it walks both the DM and the players through the process of clearing out an abandoned stronghold, restoring it, and defending it against local enemies. Includes maps of the stronghold, both as a ruin and as a restored base of operations.  ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nCertainly the greatest risk is producing minis.

I love to game and I love cartooning. It turns out that they make a perfect combination. \nThe great thing about a daily webcomic is there is always plenty of new material, and we now have enough for Volume 2 in the series. So let the campaign begin... \nI believe that Kickstarters need to be fun, clean and unpredictable, and that's why we turned ours into a game. The more levels we unlock, the more monsters we defeat, and the better the goodies that the adventurers can bring home.\nSo let's start with the bare-bones.\nThe Book\n Life of the Party Vol 2: Role for Initiative will start as a 90 page soft cover book, with a uv spot cover (this means there is a gloss overlay on the cover to help it stand out). The basic book will feature the comic pages that have already been posted online (including the cameo cartoons from the last Kickstarter), plus all sorts of extra little goodies. Once we hit the goal and begin to \"Level Up!\" I will look at upgrading the cover as well as the page count. The more pages the merrier, in my opinion.\nTo print 2000 books and ship a huge portion of them out, my blacksmith and gnomes will need about 7000 gold pieces, but they also take US Dollars. This will cover production costs, shipping and packaging (which I know, from experience, is a significant expense), Kickstarter fees, and any surprise costs which decide to show up.\nHere's a few of the comics that will be in the book\nHere's where we are at.... \n        Your character sheet (we levels up again)\n    Leveling up...The NEW Dungeon\nGrab your armor and favorite weapon, and join in our quest to level up. Each stretch goal opens a new level for Life of the Party, and each one of those levels is guarded by a fierce monster. On the plus side, where there's a monster, there's always loot! \nWhen we reach the stretch goal - we triumph over the monster, claim their treasure, and then progress on to the new level that appears beneath us. You can track our progress with our LOTP Character sheet. It tells you what level we are and what rewards have become available at a quick glance.\n Into the dungeon\n            Inks for the first folder\n  The colors for the trifold folder \n      Cover to the coloring book-  \n   The pint pledge add-ons. You can choose from one these designs or add-ons or both if you want. These designs are limited to one print run. Meaning that once they are all gone- that will be it. If I do more glasses, they will all be limited to one print run. Also the extra packaging to protect these beautiful glasses has been adjusted for the add-on.  \nFor each additional glass after the $35 add-on is $15.\nThe Thief found something incredible- he found the glasses were upgraded automatically with new designs. \n      What an adventure. Thank you for the support- thank you for being part of the adventure. Now back to the tavern for tales, songs and ale... Thank you again for making this adventure a reality.... :) This has been one incredible ride :)\n On to the Rewards\nRewards come in many different flavors, from the book itself to original, custom illustrations of different sizes and complexity. There is even the opportunity to become a Knight of the Order of the Bunny.\nIf you want to add additional books or add the original Life of the Party Book, just add $20 per book to your pledge-\n                    Shipping and why we have to add international shipping....\n  International Shipping. Due to shipping costs rising all over the world for us, we have to charge extra for shipping. Currently, it costs around $25 USD to ship to Australia. This is actually the norm for most areas - between $15 and $25. If we offered free shipping, it would eat up all the money that will be used for production, and that would make everybody sad. We do NOT want people to be sad. \nAlso if you mistype your address and the book is returned to us, we will ask you to help cover the costs to reship the reward.\nShare the fun.\nHonestly, it's no fun gaming by yourself. So grab some friends, dice, controllers, your incredible imagination, humor and a love for fun and make the experience wonderful for everyone. The bigger the party the more fun the adventures can be. So please invite people to join the fun.\nWho's Trav?\nMy names Trav- and I am an artist, gamer and dreamer. I have been creating books and illustrations for 20 years. Past books and current series that I am working on are Life of the Party: Realities of an RPG'er, Tanner Jones and the Quest for the Monkey Stone, The Bean (an Eisner nominated webcomic series), Adventures for a Lazy Afternoon and many more. I love Kickstarter and how it has been able to help me and other illustrators create some fantastic projects.

After 8 successful projects and one that failed, I have come to realize that as you can hope everything to run smoothly, but that is not always the case. Sometimes, things just happen.\n\nFor instance, shipping can be delayed. The boat could sink. You could miss the e-mail with the survey from Backerkit or Kickstarter (this happens a lot). The computer with all the files could explode... a variety of reasons.\n\nThough I cannot predict all the things that could happen, I know that the most important thing is to keep communication open with my backers. Those who have backed my previous projects know this to be true, you will find I am easy to contact.\n\nAnother issue and we are having a little bit of that with the last one- is people answering the backer kit questionnaire and making sure they are using an accurate credit card as well as putting in the proper address information. If a reward gets shipped back to us because you put in the wrong address, then we will ask you to help cover the shipping to resend it. \n\nMy goal is to make this project run as smoothly as possible. If there is a bump, which happens from time to time, I will let you know about it. I won't keep you in the dark. My goal is to run my projects clean, smoothly and very open.

To add the Scepter as an add-on, add $199 to your pledge.\nThe Dragon Staff \nThe Dragon Staff functions exactly like the Chaos Staff but it has a more ornate head. \n  The Chaos Scepter\nThe Chaos Scepter functions just like the Chaos Staff but it is half the length, which makes it even easier to wield.\n  PLAY\n\nThe Rewards\n  Hi, Dave the Unicorn here. As a mystical creature, I can say with authority that existing wizard staff designs are distinctly nonmagical. They fail at smiting monsters, enchanting brooms, or transforming your foes into frogs. Heck, they can\u2019t even conjure a decent illusion to help you escape the annual holiday dinner shouting match with your in-laws. \n\nAt Magic Wizard Staff, we\u2019ve made it our quest to create wizard staffs that actually do wizard things.\n  Standing over seven spans tall, the Fog Staff is capped with a glowing eldritch orb that billows clouds of mist on command to delight your friends and mystify your foes.\nThe cloud billows thickly from the crown of the staff, and creates beautiful lighting effects as the cloud interacts with the powerful LED lighting.\n  Our second staff is best suited for adventurers of an infernal bent. Topped with horns of mythril aluminum, the Chaos Staff crackles with enough lightning to stun a Balrog and produces 3000 BTUs of fireball-casting fun. \n              Toasting marshmallows just got a lot more satisfying.\n  All of our staffs are constructed from furniture-grade PVC, which makes them lightweight and durable. They also come in one of two color schemes: abyssal black (left) or elvish oak (right).\n                                                       Chief Engineering Wizard Steve (left) and Dave The Unicorn (right) make friends with this guy (middle) at the Minnesota Renaissance Festival.\nWe\u2019ve spent months talking to Ren Festers, dungeon delvers, LARPers, and fantasy enthusiasts of all colors of mana in our effort to make the best wizard staffs possible. Here is what we heard from you and we are happy to say we have been able to deliver!\nReal magical effects (light, fog, sparks, fire) \nLong-lasting and rechargeable effects \nLightweight and durable staff design \nRealistic faux wood finish \nSleek and simple design to allow for personalization \nA \u201csafe\u201d option (The Fog Staff with light, fog, and durable plastic head) \nA \u201cshow\u201d piece (The Chaos Staff with flame, sparks, and a metal head)\nHow did a simple unicorn like me end up as a senior engineer for a wizard staff company? This project started out as an overbuilt Halloween prop and a whimsical weekend project among friends, but we received such a positive response from the wider wizarding community that we felt called to make our staffs available so sorcerers and sorceresses everywhere can share excitement of holding magic in their hands.\nOver time we gathered our team by finding those of us with the skills and motivation to also want to build awesome wizard staffs with mystical powers. Our dedicated team is now 8 strong and continues to grow as needed.\n  ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are risks and challenges to any adventure and making Magic Wizard Staffs a reality is no exception. Our band of skilled and knowledgeable adventures is up to the task. Here are the risks we foresee and what we have done to mitigate them. \n\n1. ) Safety and legal concerns around selling a device that produces flame: \n\n - First, to be clear the Chaos Staff is NOT a flamethrower. The California definition of a flamethrower is \u201cany non-stationary and transportable device designed or intended to emit or propel a burning stream of combustible or flammable liquid a distance of at least 10 feet\" H&W 12750 (a).\u201d The Chaos Staff does not propel liquid fuel and its flame is 3 feet or less. \n\n- You are responsible for using the Chaos Staff in a safe manner. It is an open flame and should be treated with respect. The flame size and intensity is a little more than a tiki torch, so the staff can be handled easily but it must be handled with caution. \n\n- Neither staff is a weapon. They are magical walking sticks.\n\n2.) Manufacturing\n\n- Manufacturing is the biggest risk and challenge faced by kickstarter projects. Our team is comprised of experts in 3D printing, design for manufacturing, and mechanical engineering. We have spent considerable time building and specing our prototypes to reduce overall manufacturing risk. \n\n- If we meet our kickstarter goal we are setup to produce our staffs in-house using small scale additive manufacturing methods. The plastic components will be 3D printed and finished at our facility, we have a contractor to watercut and finish the metal fins, and we will assemble the staffs in-house. If we exceed our kickstarter goal and reach $50k we have manufacturing partners lined up who can produce our plastic parts via injection molding and an another partner to assemble. All of our partners are located in Minnesota, USA and we have established professional relationships with all of them. \n\n3. Shipping\n\n- We have a strong and unique relationship with a fulfillment partner who is located in St. Cloud, Minnesota less than an hour away from the Magic Wizard Staff facility. We have a clear plan and costs for shipping our staffs anywhere in the USA except Maryland. We will not ship to Maryland because of their laws regarding flame producing devices. \n\n- We have included a flat rate shipping price for our kickstarter.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Wizard's Apprentice", "descp": "Welcome apprentice, you will gain access to all of our lore.

Fans of every fantasy game system will now have a common world to share.\nIn the future we hope to support more game systems. Loxley welcomes contact with all fellow creators and publishers.\nWhen you have the same scenery, it's easy to try the Intro version of another game system. It's a big world of tabletop gaming out there\u2014take a look around!\nYou\u2019ve seen the core team of 16 and the amazing list of legendary guests, 11 authors and 9 artists. You\u2019ve heard about the plan to provide game specifics (\u2018crunch\u2019) for 10 game systems. But what IS the Setting really? What\u2019s there now, and what\u2019s happening soon? Good question. It\u2019s complicated. For the long version click HERE; summary below.\nHistory: This continent is the original home of all demi-humans, who know how to get along with each other and with nature. Humans arrived, tried to conquer the place, but were forced to compromise because they didn\u2019t have an edge. Their realm, Empyrea, has evolved for 3 centuries. Their kings followed a three-prong strategy of cooperation: Minimize technology, promote magic (obeying the gods), Work with nature and the planet for long-term stability and health, and Support knowledge, the arts, and quality of life; avoid misuse of wealth and power.\nPlace: Empyrea is a rectangle. The left side is a coast with sea monsters. Mountains north, with giants. East is blocked, impassible terrain. Deepwood south, with creatures, then tribes, then evil armies -- and they\u2019re planning to visit soon.\nBelow is the primitive digital map that has been available to online players since 1992. Darlene is now rendering it in her unique style, Anna is transforming that into 3D imagery, and Alyssa is detailing cities and towns. Guest authors are detailing locations... Inns, ships, shops, and more.\nOnline campaign map 1992-present\nPeople: The dwur claim the land below, but most dislike sunlight, so noniz handle their surface business. The olve claim the woodlands, and many hobniz are in the gourmet trade near towns. Other \u2018niz (brownies and sprites and many more) are about, as are the Others, various odd monstrous races and variations.\nAction: Upcoming issues of the realm will emerge as time passes. The call to arms will sound, and the fate of the realm will be decided \u2013 perhaps by your characters! Will you run and hide, or are you a real Hero?\nHow To Play\n\nStart: Either your characters grew up here, or they popped in from another place. We\u2019ll provide guidelines for both, and three kits for suggested local character backgrounds (urban, farm, borderlands). In a starting adventure the characters meet and head out seeking fame and fortune.\nYour Stuff: You bring your characters, your game system, your style. Magic, monsters, gods? Use whatever you like. Empyrea will be the backdrop to your stories, just some new names at first. More is there when you\u2019re ready for it.  \nYou seem to be a serious hobby gamer. Consider this a useful tool, a 'second home'. This is a complicated fantasy campaign world, and we can only describe a small part of it in advance. So if you have questions, please post them on any of several sites available. We\u2019re still building that part of things, so bear with us, and help us grow!  \nQueen Nuana and King John IV\n  With the Quick Start Guides (presenting character backgrounds from city, farm, and wilderness life) and starter Adventures, you\u2019ll be playing immediately and learning fast. Supporting materials include the Empyrea Core Book, Player\u2019s Handbook, full color Darlene maps, 3 \"Little Brown Books\", and a System Book with your preferred FRP rules.\nImagine a game world that we all share, and one that you can shape. All subscribers can add their own designs to the official Worlds of Empyrea\u2014realms that are mostly empty, waiting for you.\nSee your own inn or tavern come to life! Or is it a shop within a Royal City? Maybe it's an entire dungeon! (Guidelines coming soon.)\nWith names like Darlene, Elmore, Easley, Jaquays, Otus, Dee, and more, you know the artwork will be of the highest caliber with that \"old-school\" feel. Speaking of Darlene, here's the Empyreal Valley, newly rendered in her famous style (caution, flashback to 1983):\n  You will receive at least 350* pages of goodness: \n \nEmpyrea Core Book (perfect bound softback, full color, UV laminated) \nEmpyrea Player\u2019s Guide (perfect bound softback, full color, UV laminated)\nFull Color 2-part Darlene Map detailing the entire Realm of Empyrea\nThree \"Little Brown Books\" with special details for players and game masters\nA System Book** with rules for playing in Empyrea using the RPG of your choice\n* 350 pages or more; we reserve the right to add more cool stuff if we can.

We\u2019ve added over 500 new models to the Bones range, and we\u2019ve discovered that these products are monstrously popular. You wanted more! More Monsters! More Demons! More Dragons! More Characters! More variety and more amazing new models!\n\nYou're in luck! With our last Kickstarter projects we only scratched the surface. We have many more models that we think deserve to be added to Bones both new sculpts and classic favorites. We\u2019d like to see if you think so, too!\nBones are still really expensive to produce, and we still need your help to expand the line. Your support makes the molds that we need to produce the figures, and in exchange you get the first crack at these figures for a fantastic deal!\nWe\u2019ve learned a lot since we fulfilled our first Bones Kickstarter project, so you won\u2019t find as many pledge levels or confusing options. Turns out that most of you just want the Core Set with its potential to expand over time. What this Kickstarter Core Set does is start with Gauth (a huge 275mm tall dragon) plus an additional 43 more models: character models, new sculpts, monsters and goblins. After we hit our goal, we have plans to make the value of your pledge grow. All we need is your support!!!\nWhat Are Bones Gaming Miniatures?\nBones are only the best high-quality plastic gaming models to hit the industry in the last decade. Inexpensive, high quality, soft gaming models that are easy and fun to paint and won't break when you actually use them for games! \n  All Backers must use the Reaper Pledge Manager to select their rewards and provide shipping information\n          ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhat are the risks and challenges that come with completing your project, and how are you qualified to overcome them?\n\nPRODUCTION AND FULFILLMENT\n\nFor a project like ours, the risks and challenges fall into three categories: \n1) Overall Non-completion \n2) Delays in meeting our estimated delivery dates \n3) We do not produce a specific model or change a specific model\n\nConcerning the risk of Overall Non-completion: we've already completed several massive Kickstarters and are fully aware of the pitfalls. Two things that could cause the non-completion of this Kickstarter are either the loss of our inbound shipments (due to an act of God, pirates or war), or a massive disaster (fire, flood) that levels our facility. Either of those events might be disastrous, however we carry full insurance on our facility and insure every shipment, no matter the size, against loss and damage.\n\nObviously either of the above tragic events would create delays in meeting our estimated delivery dates, and that brings us to the second category: delays. We have learned a lot from our Kickstarters. However, delays are simply part of the cycle of business and it is our wisdom, training, and experience that would help us mitigate and work through any delay. Some delays, like ones we have control or exercise input over, are easy to solve. Other delays are out of our control, such as US Customs and Border Protection and Consumer Product Safety Commission inspections and delays. In the end we do everything possible to avoid any delay and will always update you as soon as possible.\n\nLastly there is the risk we will not produce a specific model shown. This will only occur if there is not enough interest in a specific model measured by the number of backers that actually pledge for to buy it verses the cost to produce it. This event has never occurred in any of our previous Kickstarters, but is nonetheless still a risk. In the event this situation develops you will have plenty of time to adjust your Pledge Manager.\n\nWe reserve the right to modify pieces shown to meet production requirements.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nIf it is with within 14 days of the closing of this Kickstarter we will refund your entire pledge amount. After 14 days, but before the closing of this Kickstarter\u2019s Reaper Pledge Manager, we will refund your entire pledge minus the 10% Kickstarter and Processing Fees we incur. Once the Reaper Pledge Manager closes, refund requests are subject to review and not all requests may be honored. \n \nYOUR BACKER RESPONSIBILITY IN THIS KICKSTARTER\n\nIf you do not log in and confirm your pledge in the Reaper Pledge Manager by July 31 2018 you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received. However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your pledge if you contact us and confirm your pledge after July 31, 2018. \n\nUnconfirmed pledges make it difficult for us to plan production and logistics. If you confirm your pledge late (after July 31, 2018) some items may not still be available. This means that part, if not all, of your rewards may not be available and/or your pledge may be forfeit. \n\nYou are responsible for all fees associated with the transit and acceptance by you to complete delivery. These include, but are not limited to: import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant and taxing authorities, VAT and GST due and delivery acceptance, brokerage and collection charges. \n\nYou are required to provide correct address information and ensure this address is deliverable by normal methods before your rewards are shipped.\n\nYou must have your address correct and up to date in the Reaper Pledge Manager when we announce shipping is beginning. You may change it at any time until then. There may be a shipping surcharge associated with changing countries.\n\nRewards returned to us as undeliverable will be shipped again postage prepaid by the Backer. \n\nALL OFFICIAL COMMUNICATIONS FOR THIS KICKSTARTER WILL BE VIA KICKSTARTER UPDATES ONLY.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Europe, Africa, Middle East, Russia", "descp": "2017 Bones 4 PLEDGE LEVEL This reward level pledges enough to get you into this Bones 4 Kickstarter.

The most common advice received was: \"Don\u2019t publish adventure modules. They don\u2019t sell.\"\nWhat we have learned since then is that advice is largely true. Poorly written, uninteresting, uninspired adventure modules do not sell.\nBut the good adventure modules \u2013 the exciting ones \u2013 that ones that read well and play well at the table \u2013 they become treasured memories for us all. They become legends. These adventures are the shared experience that builds our community. We remember our exploits, ask each other how a different group handled that encounter, and lament the secret doors we may have missed. We tell our friends about the climactic finale; we are in turns surprised and devastated and thrilled as we navigate the encounters. And most importantly, if an adventure is fun to play \u2013 if the game master and the players both have a blast \u2013 then we tell our friends, and they play, and they tell their friends, and that adventure becomes a community builder. It is played thousands and thousands of times. It becomes a legend.\nThis book is about how to create tabletop RPG adventures that become those legends. This book is about how to write great adventure modules \u2013 the ones that gamers can\u2019t stop talking about.\nWhat Is This Kickstarter For?\nThis Kickstarter funds the creation of a printed book called How To Write Adventure Modules That Don\u2019t Suck. Depending on stretch goals, it will be published in either softcover or hardcover format, possibly with other stretch goals as well. The estimated length is 160 pages. In addition, another book called The Adventurers Almanac is funded by this Kickstarter. The Adventurers Almanac, by Michael Curtis, provides a wealth of additional material to inspire a gamemaster in the direction of their campaign.\nGoodman Games has published more than 200 adventures and built an institutional knowledge on how to write adventure modules that don\u2019t suck. Many of our adventures are \u201cmodern classics\u201d that have been in print for many years, in some cases earning a 2nd, 3rd, or even 4th printing as they continue to sell year after year. For years we have run seminars at Gen Con and other conventions by this same name, How to Write Adventure Modules That Don\u2019t Suck.\nThe book How to Write Adventure Modules that Don\u2019t Suck consolidates all that institutional advice, all those great seminar discussions, all of our hard-earned lessons and experience, into an easy-to-digest format. Twenty five authors, all of them with impressive credits in RPG adventure design, have written themed articles addressing a wide variety of topics. Along with each article, each author has provided a fantasy RPG encounter that demonstrates the concepts they address.\nThe book is designed to be usable with any RPG, in any genre, under any rules set. Developer James M. Ward has hand-selected the authors and managed the topics to maximize the utility of the book. You can read the book straight through, or flip to the section that addresses your specific concerns. By the time you\u2019re done reading the book, your own adventure-writing efforts will improve. Mr. Ward says it best in his introduction:\nThis is the primer that every game designer needs to have on his bookshelf. I\u2019ve been in the role-playing game design industry for more than forty years. In many of those years my products were the best selling products out that year. I learned many new things from this set of articles. I have learned things that have improved my design skills, so I know they will improve yours as well.\n Not Just Essays: Adventure Starters, Too\nAs part of the writing process, we asked each contributor to write an essay with adventure-design advice. We also asked each contributor to write a short encounter that put their advice to use. These encounters are \"adventure starters\" - ready-to-go material for you as the game master to use! If you're stuck on while writing your own adventure, you can use the essays of advice, or utilize these \"adventure starters\" to build out your own scenario.\nAbout the Contributors\nHow to Write Adventure Modules that Don\u2019t Suck represents the distilled wisdom of a pool of great adventure writers. Fans of Goodman Games and TSR will recognize many of the names and backgrounds. This is certainly not every great adventure writer in the business, but it\u2019s a darn good cross-section. Here is the list of contributors in alphabetical order:\nJobe Bittman has worked as a freelance RPG writer and game designer for nearly a decade. His writing has appeared in publications by Wizards of the Coast, Goodman Games, Lamentations of the Flame Princess, and Kobold Press. Jobe has been privileged with the opportunity to work on professional projects with such gaming legends as James Ward (Metamorphosis Alpha) and Steve Crompton (Grimtooth\u2019s Traps). Goodman Games recently announced Jobe\u2019s latest project, a new RPG adaption of Jack Vance\u2019s Dying Earth.\nMike Breault began working on RPGs in 1984 when he was hired at TSR. Over the next eight years, he contributed to more than 80 games, modules, and hardback rules books published by TSR and Milton Bradley (HeroQuest).

Most known for his work with Goodman Games, Michael is the brilliant mind behind such Dungeon Crawl Classics adventures as Frozen in Time, Intrigue at the Court of Chaos, The Chained Coffin, and the award-winning Dungeon Alphabet. He is currently the lead writer for the DCC Lankhmar line of game supplements based on the works of acclaimed author Fritz Leiber. Michael lives in Long Island, NY, with the requisite number of cats for a writer and far too many books.\nChris Doyle began freelance writing in the game industry in the early 1990\u2019s through volunteer efforts with the Role Playing Game Association (RPGA). He has since freelanced for several companies such as TSR, West End Games, Wizards of the Coast, Atlas Games, and Goodman Games. Although he has designed and contributed to RPG source material, the majority of his projects have been the design of adventure modules. He has penned adventures for the 2nd edition, the 3rd edition, 3.5, 4E and 5E for the world\u2019s first fantasy RPG game.\nJoseph Goodman owns Goodman Games.

He wrote three books on mythology in RPGs for Mayfair Games (Fantastic Treasures I and II, and Monsters of Myth & Legend III).\nJon Hook suspects that most of today\u2019s game authors, like himself, have been creating fantasy, sci-fi, and horror adventures since they were a kid. The only difference now is the paycheck. Jon is very passionate about the people who comprise the role-playing and tabletop game community, and they have been very kind and supportive of the work he has created. Jon is by far a Call of Cthulhu guy, and has been fortunate enough to have work published by a variety of Call of Cthulhu publishers, including Goodman Games. His most recent Cthulhu adventure is Age of Cthulhu 9: The Lost Expedition.\nKevin Melka was hired as the RPGA Network\u2019s Tournament Coordinator after a decade of writing and running adventures .

He also has design credits in the Forgotten Realms, Dark Sun, and several d20 worlds. Kevin is writing adventures and participating in organized play events today, and still enjoys role-playing games with the friends he met in the basement of a hobby shop in 1983. \nBrendan J. LaSalle is a writer, game designer, and odd-job man who had the good fortune to discover his true calling in 1977 when he was introduced to AD&D. He is the author of several DCC adventures and supplements for Goodman Games, Fat Dragon, Savage Mojo, Hand Made Games, Pandahead Publishing, Troll Lord Games, and others. He is best known as the creator of Xcrawl, the dungeon-adventure-cum-alternative-modern-death-sport he has published since 2012. He lives in Salem, MA, with his wife, cat, and puggle.\nLloyd Metcalf began gaming in the early eighties when he and his friends all pitched in for the Basic Red box D&D. From then on, he was always dreaming of other worlds, heroes and spells. Now as an adult, he can hardly believe it is his work to create, illustrate, and produce RPG supplements. It has been just over 30 years of immersion into the game and in the last few, he has been humbled and honored to have worked with many of the people who created and illustrated the game that changed his life. Lloyd\u2019s website is at http://FailSquadGames.com \nBill Olmesdahl has been a DM and player for almost 40 years. He started writing for West End Games in the 90\u2019s on Star Wars, Torg, and Paranoia before moving to TSR and working on Forgotten Realms, Dark Sun, Spellfire and Dragon Dice.

She\u2019s enjoyed RPGs ever since\u2026AD&D, Star Wars, Champions, and 77 Lost Worlds. Once upon a time she worked at TSR, Inc. in Lake Geneva, running the Role-Playing Games Association (RPGA); she designed scenarios, monsters, and big robots for TSR and other game companies.\nMerle M.

Since then he has written nearly 50 adventures, sourcebooks and short stories, but remains hopeful the next one that will finally be good. He is grateful to every judge that has ever run one of his adventures; you guys are the ones that make these words alive. \nJim Wampler is currently a writer, editor, and occasional art director and layout monkey for Goodman Games. In addition to the forthcoming Mutant Crawl Classics RPG, Jim has written several Metamorphosis Alpha adventures and two sequel adventures for the DCC RPG Purple Planet series for Goodman Games. As overlord of the Dungeon Crawl Cabal, Jim has also overseen a secret cabal of talented writers and artists who have created three DCC RPG tournament funnels for use by the Goodman Games Road Crew.\nJames M. Ward on James M. Ward: I had the distinct pleasure of learning how to play D&D on Gary Gygax\u2019s side porch in 1974. Gary must have seen some spark in me because he allowed me to try my hand at writing Metamorphosis Alpha, the first science fiction role-playing game. I went from writing MA to writing Gamma World, the first apocalypse role-playing game. Over the last forty years or so I\u2019ve written many RPG things with my latest being the 77 Lost Worlds RPG campaign setting. Goodman Games has been kind enough to revive the MA intellectual property and now there are lots of MA adventures and accessories to enjoy; and I thank them for that.\nSkip Williams started running role-playing games in 1975, shortly after meeting a fellow named Gary Gygax. Before long, Skip joined the original TSR, Inc. as a part-time employee and later full time as director of the Gen Con game fair.

Steve\u2019s shorter ramblings can be found at www.HowlingTower.com, or @StvWinter on Twitter.\nThe Adventurer's Almanac\nThis fantasy sourcebook, estimated at 112 pages when published, is structured around a fantasy calendar. Written like a fantasy version of the Farmer's Almanac, it provides hundreds of adventure seeds, organized around the passing of the seasons, fantastic holidays, and the movement of the calendar.

See the original promo below:\nTrueTiles is a 2.5\" modular dungeon tile system for your home 3D printer which stand apart from all other dungeon tile options in that they solve several gameplay issues that have long plagued tabletop gamers.  As a GM, you have enough to worry about without the added concerns that monsters wont fit in the corridors or that you cant replicate the dungeons exactly how they are drawn.  You shouldn't work for your dungeon tiles, your dungeon tiles should work for you!  The 2.5 inch tile system allows you to place any 2 tiles next to each other without creating an offset due to wall thickness, and finally gives you back a playable area next to walls! Get back in the driver seat and enjoy the added playability that TrueTiles bring to your gaming table!\nIf you missed the initial release, don't worry.  \nNow is is a great time to pick up the Base Dungeon Set!\nThe TrueTiles Base Dungeon Set includes everything pictured above and will allow you to construct dungeons with limitless configurations.  \nWith low walls, TrueTiles print faster and cheaper than other printable tiles on the market.   This means you can create larger dungeons more quickly for the same price in material as competitors!\nLow walls mean you no longer have to stand to see the action. It also means you can use those large miniatures that wouldn't fit with the 'other' dungeon tiles\n  Want to speed up your printing even more? It's not a problem for TrueTiles, they look great printed at .2mm too!\n  Create the dungeon you want. Place the doors where ever you need them. Special door tiles? Not any more!\n  Design the compact dungeons from classic modules. That \"shared wall\" problem is a thing of the past!\n  No need for a special Secret Door tile that crafty players have learned to identify long before it is searched for. Place Secret Doors where ever you want.... but only after they have been found!\n  We have spent hundreds of hours designing all of the models. We crammed as much detail as the pieces will hold, even the locks have key holes!\nAnd now, the time has come to expand the base set!\nThe first expansion set for TrueTiles is the Chasm Set\nThe chasm Set includes everything pictured above.  Now you can add cracks, fissures, holes, and chasms to your dungeons.  There are also several bridge options to span the chasms.  Don't look down!\nHere are a few printed and painted chasm pieces.\nWith all of the Chasm Set pieces available, you can create the dungeon obstacles right for you.\nMaybe it is just a small crack with a rickety plank bridge.\n  Maybe it is a larger crack with a rope bridge.\n  With just a little household string, you can make rope bridges as short or as long as you like!\n  A large chasm spanned by a crumbling stone bridge guarded by orcs.\n.\n\"Rumor has it that an ancient and terrible earthquake ravaged even the lowest reaches of the dungeon.\"\nObviously, we could go on and on giving you examples of what these tiles can do, but the truth is, as you already know, there are limitless possibilities! \nOur second expansion set is the Water Set.\nThe Water Set includes everything pictured above.   Add water hazards to your dungeons in the form of large lakes, small pools, or winding rivers.  The set also comes with a few bridge options, a dock, several boats, and a waterfall.  Polish those 'rings of swimming', because you know that that plate armor you're wearing is no longer your friend!\nHere are a few of the water tiles printed and painted.\n  Just like the Chasm Set, you can create the water features that you want.  Its high tide...er...time that your dungeon tiles worked for you!\nThe old worn broken bridge adds some character to this dungeon.\n  Both wooden bridges also contain grid lines to make counting spaces easier.\n  Drop small or large islands in with ease!\n  \"We're taking on water, Cap'n!\"\n  There is no limit to the different configurations you can make using these modular tiles!\nAnd of course, you can put them all together to create whatever you can dream up.\nWith TrueTiles, you can finally create all of those dungeons you've been drawing on graph paper since you were a kid with dungeon tiles.    There is no limit to the creativity or fun you can have with TrueTiles.\nEven if you don't play RPG games like Dungeons and Dragons, or Pathfinder, you can still use TrueTiles to jazz up your favorite dungeon style board games!\nWith this Kickstarter, we plan to bring you some great new tiles in the form of Stretch Goals, to add even more advanced options to your dungeons!  We have some awesome ideas in store for you, but you can certainly offer ideas in the comments section.  Who knows, we might just drop some of your ideas as Stretch goals or even as bonus models!

Forged in Magic: REFORGED doesn\u2019t just provide a list of items and their properties, but many also have a backstory on its creation or history. While these stories are set in the Arcanis: World of Shattered Empires campaign setting, the rich detail can help you place these in any published setting or your own home made campaign.\nBack Forged in Magic: REFORGED today and recapture that wonder from even veteran players with magic items they\u2019ve never heard of.\n Forged in Magic: REFORGED begins as a 160-page softback with color illustrations. As we meet Stretch Goals, we\u2019ll increase the size of the book, add more art and unlock the HARDBACK upgrade as well. The book is beautifully illustrated by talented artists, such as Pat Loboyko and Ricardo German Ponce Torres and filled with a wealth of information. Forged in Magic: REFORGED will also include new types of magic items, such as Weapons of War and Fetishes to every DMs favorite, the Cursed item. We\u2019ll even shoe horn a new Archetype to make use of those fetishes, the mystical and mysterious Ehtzara.\nTo increase the book's utility, magic items will be tagged with their land of origin, such as Yahssremoran Empire (serpent empire), Eloran Empire (elven empire), the Imperium of Man (ancient human empire), Yhing Hir tribes (nomadic people), etc. An appendix with charts sorting the magic items by the land of origin will allow DMs to quickly sift through the hundreds of items in the book and select the proper treasure for the adventure. For example, if your players are adventuring in half-sunken ruins in the swamps, then an item from the Yahssremoran Empire (serpent empire) might be appropriate.\nBelow are a few samples pages (layout is not final)  to give you an idea of what you can expect to find within Forged in Magic: REFORGED.\nSample Layout - Not Final\nSample Layout - Not Final\nWhile the manuscript is done, we would like to lavishly illustrate the book with work from some of the top artists in the RPG Fantasy industry, as well as print enough copies to offer it to gaming stores worldwide.

We do not expect to make a profit from the shipping charges, but by the same token, we also cannot afford to lose money on it either.\nAfter the Kickstarter campaign ends, we will send out a backer survey to collect your mailing addresses. Using this information, we will get the most accurate shipping pricing we can based on our actual cost to ship your reward level to your home and then charge you that amount.\nShipping a book of this size to Europe, the UK and Australia is around $24.00 to $26.00, Canada a bit less and to anywhere in the US, about $5.00. We'll continue to explore other methods to decrease the cost as much as possible. \nPLEASE DO NOT ADD THESE ESTIMATED COSTS TO YOUR PLEDGE! Once the final book is done and the surveys received, we will let you know the actual cost. We will also group orders together at your request to save on shipping costs. \nOnce we reach the main goal of publishing the book, we'll add Stretch Goals to enhance the book by adding more material ($9,000) and more art work ($11,000). Further Stretch Goals will see the book published as a hardback at no additional cost to you!\nAnother future Stretch Goal that I'm very excited to offer is a twist on the \"Lairs\u201d encounter.

You decide!\nGP Adventures LLC is game company created by partners Ernest Gary Gygax Jr. and Benoist Poir\u00e9.\nERNEST GARY GYGAX JR.: First son of E. Gary Gygax of Dungeons & Dragons fame, Ernie the Barbarian has been a gamer nearly as long as he lived. He literally cut his first tooth on an Avalon Hill Panzer division, and went on from there to play many games, from board games to miniatures war games to, ultimately, role-playing games with his father and their many friends. One of the very first players, along with Robert J. Kuntz and his sister Elise, of the Dungeons & Dragons role-playing game, Ernest is better known as the player behind the very first magic-user, Tenser. As such, his collaborations to the game include the play testing of any material penned by his father during his time at TSR. You can blame Ernie for such game features as: Cone of Cold being 5th, not 3rd level, Haste spells aging their targets, different hit dice for different character types and classes, as well as multiple attacks for fighters in order to keep Tenser focused on his proper spell-slinging role in the game. Ernest was also the player of such reknown characters as Erac's Cousin, who ventured into the lands of Mars, and Burne, the magic-user of Hommlet that made it as an NPC in module T1-4 Temple of Elemental Evil.\n\nErnest Gary Gygax Jr. became part of the TSR company, participated to the creation of such game products as the Dungeon Geomorphs, the Monster & Treasure Assortment, created the Water Weird and even gave the young company a slogan to fit its new image: \u201cThe Game Wizards\u201d, for which he was handsomely rewarded by his father with a large glass of single malt and a cigar in his private office at age 16. Ernie wore many hats at TSR, from shipping clerk to EVP of Consumer Services in charge of 22 employees broken down into the Dungeon hobby shop, the mail order catalog services, Gen Con and the RPGA. He later was VP Creative for Dungeons & Dragons Entertainment, and Associate Editor of the Strategy & Tactics magazine in 1986. He is the co-author with his brother Lucion and David Moore of Troll Lord Games\u2019s The Lost City of Gaxmoor, and more recently the co-author of the Marmoreal Tomb of Garn Pat'uul (the first level of the Marmoreal Tomb Main Module below) in Gygax Magazine Issue 3 and the Stone Alignments of Kor Nak (available for free from our website, see link below) with partner-in-crime Benoist Poir\u00e9.\nBENOIST POIRE: Frenchman and mapper extraordinaire, Benoist lives in British Columbia, Canada. Though relatively new to game design, he has been part of various gaming communities on the internet for the better part of the last fifteen years. He started playing at age 11 with the first edition of Advanced Dungeons & Dragons and later experimented with a great variety of games and play styles. Growing up, Benoist was tremendously inspired by his parents: Some of his most personal pencil techniques were directly handed down from mother to son, while his maps\u2019 general structures owe a lot to his father\u2019s analytical skills. Benoist soon became part of different gaming clubs, helped organize local conventions and wrote multiple amateur game modules.\n\nBenoist ended up running the Original game of 1974 and became a contributor to Robert J. Kuntz\u2019s blog, Lord of the Green Dragons. He later authored a critically acclaimed series of Advice to Build A Megadungeon and the Campaign Around It, and contributed to the development of the Astonishing Swordsmen & Sorcerers of Hyperborea role-playing game. Benoist published his first adventure module in AFS Magazine Issue 3. He since co-authored the Marmoreal Tomb of Garn Pat'uul and the Stone Alignments of Kor Nak with Ernest Gary Gygax, Jr.\nFor more information about GP Adventures, visit our website at gp-adventures.com.\nThe Marmoreal Tomb Campaign Starter is a completely self-contained sandbox module introducing Ernest Gary Gygax Jr.'s setting, The Hobby Shop Dungeon, and the lands of the Duinnsmere around it, to the gaming masses. The Marmoreal Tomb can be played entirely on its own, in whole or in parts, or used at the game table in conjunction with other GP Adventures offerings. It can be used with its own default setting of The Duinnsmere, and/or in conjunction to other settings, published and home-brewed. Its design seeks to reflect both the way Ernest Gary Gygax Jr. runs the game, and to be amenable to one's own preferences and play styles.\nTHE HOBBY SHOP DUNGEON is an adventure game setting originally created by Ernest Gary Gygax Jr. in 1978 while working as a clerk for the fondly-remembered Dungeon Hobby Shop of Lake Geneva, WI. Inspired by the many games and campaigns he played with his father and many friends, and aided by incomplete maps initially drawn by Terry Kuntz, Ernest came up with a large sprawling dungeon complex that could be used to run games at the store. Since then, more than a thousand players have explored its depths, as remembered by Ernest, including TSR alumni, family members, customers and gamer friends, up to 22 players per sitting! It has been played in a variety of venues including Margaret Weis\u2019s and Don Perrin\u2019s Game Guild, in California\u2019s Dungeons & Dragons Entertainment division, as a special event for game conventions and many more besides.\nThis is this entire dungeon and setting around it that GP Adventures wants to bring to publication via its Hobby Shop Dungeon game line, starting now with the Marmoreal Tomb Campaign Starter.\nEpic battle between the Stone-Cutter dwarves and Young Krassus the Cambion. Art Mark Allen, 2014.\nTHE MARMOREAL TOMB\nThe Marmoreal Tomb is an entirely self-contained module that ties into the greater campaign of The Hobby Shop Dungeon. It is meant to present the Lake Geneva Gygaxian play style in its original form, using first edition compatible rules, and to be able to be used with different versions of the game as well, including its more recent variants, 5th edition included.\nIN-GAME PREMISE: Nester's Folly, as the dwarves call it, is the underground maze under Castle Celadon created by the Archmage and \u201cEurthwright\u201d Nester De Guyx, a personage who, despite some mentions in the Annals of the Duinnsmere, is shrouded in relative mystery. Tales abound about the magic-user and his many eccentricities, but little is known for sure. Nester in fact built the first levels of his dungeons with the help of a group of dwarves who would become the founders of the Stone-Cutter clan. They worked with Nester on the completion of the upper levels for many years, diligently so.\nWhen their work was completed, the dwarves were rewarded by Nester who revealed to them the location of long-abandoned caves they could call home and use to quarry marble for themselves. The dwarves just had to be careful not to dig too deep within the mountain, and it would be alright. The Stone-Cutter clan moved to the mountain, built a settlement, and prospected around the place to find new marble veins to quarry.\nThe temptation was too much for them: soon enough, they found the sealed tomb of a Stone Giant under the settlement, and their greed got the better of them. They plundered it, and triggered tremors that would be felt by evil giants far away. Young Krassus, a Stone Giant Cambion, roused his brothers to arms, and together they attacked and utterly destroyed the dwarven hold, reclaiming those artifacts that were found in the tomb for themselves. Those few dwarves who survived the attack would ultimately find refuge back within Nester's Folly. The giants ultimately moved, and abandoned the place once again.\nYears have gone by since the attack of Young Krassus. The ruined corridors of the Marmoreal Tomb are home to a variety of monsters who may one day grow and unite to become a threat to the lands south of the river Maeve. Now, the location of the Tomb has been found by a new generation of adventurers, and it is up to them to deal with this state of affairs and explore the Tomb. Unbeknownst to them, there are still burial vaults lying under the settlement, many of them undisturbed. Beyond the vaults, deep under the surface, lies an even greater threat, the Hearth of Chaos, cradle of the giants since time immemorial, a maze imbued by the ever-changing forces once unleashed by the lords of entropy upon the material plane. Will the player characters be able to avoid them entirely, or contain them if need be? That remains to be seen.\nOgre of the Marmoreal Tomb. Art Mark Allen, 2014.\nStarting work on The Hobby Shop Dungeon and the Marmoreal Tomb thereafter, we had three very clear and interconnected design goals we tried to address throughout the early phases of the project, and will continue to elaborate on as we produce the physical products and bring them all to the gaming table.\nDESIGN GOAL #1: THE GYGAXIAN GAME. The Marmoreal Tomb has to present an authentic Gygaxian game play experience and present it in an original, unaltered format for those that want it. As such, the module is described by default using first-edition compatible rules, which allow game masters and players to experience the module the way it was played at Ernest Gary Gygax Jr.'s game table. This play style is directly inspired by the games Ernest played with his father, obviously, and we couldn't pass on the opportunity to bring about the publication of an entire castle and campaign that would honor and address this play style in an authentic fashion today.\nSince the first advanced rules of the game are readily available for anyone to peruse today, whether in their original or free OGL formats, this default presentation will also be useful to those who use different editions and variants of the game, as they will be able to get access to the original format, use the material and tweak it in a manner significant to their own game and campaigns, whatever play style that implies.\nThe Main Module and two Expansion Packs include guidelines for use with other editions of the game by default, including its current Fifth Edition. If we make our funding goal, stretch goals include add-ons for full conversions to both Fifth Edition and Pathfinder game systems.\nThe Hunting Party. A new threat for the players exploring the first level of the Tomb. Art Mark Allen, 2014.\nDESIGN GOAL #2: A MODULAR, NON-LINEAR GAME SETTING. Modularity and non-linearity are key to our offerings. While working on certain sets of premises (like a band of dwarves building a settlement or the presence of a Hearth of Chaos in your world), our modules are designed in a way that is reflective of the early design ethic of TSR offerings. This approach implies a description of open-ended locales of adventure which can be played straight, for exploration or \u201cdungeon crawling\u201d games using the original and advanced games, or inserted into different campaign structures using different rules sets with different play styles in mind.\nWe are not about to just redo or copy what has been done before. The Giants series, the Temple of Elemental Evil and Keep on the Borderlands are great modules because they do what they do best. We do not intend to \u201cfix\u201d or \u201creplace\u201d them. Not only are they not our properties to deal with, they are what they are for a reason. The Marmoreal Tomb is meant to take a place next to these classics as a broad, epic adventure gaming offering of its own.\nThis implies some new, fresh takes on the design conceits that made these classics great. In the Marmoreal Tomb's case, it comes from its modularity. As presented, the Marmoreal Tomb module can be used on its own, or in conjunction with one or two of its expansion packs, the \u201cWilderness\u201d and the \u201cUnderworld\u201d, built to reflect the game structure of the original game of 1974.\nMushroom Cave, Art by Mark Allen, 2014.\nALL THE MAPS included in this module and its expansion packs come along with map keys detailing the various features, locales and encounter areas on the maps for play. These descriptions make up the meat of the game module and expansions, just like classic TSR modules. The module and its expansion packs are each detailed using first edition compatible rules when relevant, and are accompanied with advice and guidelines explaining how to rescale the whole, use it with a different edition or variant of the game, and/or shift genres, play styles and/or role-playing games entirely.\nTHE MARMOREAL TOMB Main Module presents the first two levels of the complex and can be used entirely on their own, for starting character levels (1-3) with guidelines to rescale threats throughout. They form a complete unit of game play together, from the exploration of the dwarven settlement to the discovery through the PCs own actions of the burial vaults of the stone giants below, facing the threats that were lying dormant there until they were disturbed by their exploration.\nMaps included in the Main Module, along with keys and all relevant information. Cartography Benoist Poir\u00e9.\nTHE WILDERNESS Expansion Pack describes the lands around the Hobby Shop Dungeon and Marmoreal Tomb, along with a description of various regions, landmarks, adventure locations, people and customs ripe for adventure around them. The village of Crom Caemloch is fully described, with NPCs, relationships, role-playing opportunities and the like. This village is meant to act as the home base of a group of adventurers exploring the Lower Midlands, The Marmoreal Tomb and The Hobby Shop Dungeon proper. Both elements, hex map and/or village, can be used on their own, with or without the Marmoreal Tomb. The map of the Lower Midlands can be used for an hex-crawling campaign, and the village dropped into one's home-brewed game setting. Given the open environment the hex map represents, threats can be lethal or benign for varying character levels throughout the campaign.\nMaps included in the Wilderness Expansion pack. Cartography Benoist Poir\u00e9.\nTHE UNDERWORLD Expansion Pack can be used as its own separate adventuring location (with suggestions on how and where to place it on the Wilderness hex map), or as an extension of the Marmoreal Tomb proper. The Extended Burial Vaults expand on the second level described in the main module, include an alternate key for the central areas if used as a completely separate place as the Main Module's burial vaults, and alter the feel of the whole from the ruined vaults of the Stone Giants of the Main Module to a haunted place coming back alive under the influence of the living Chaos below. The source of this evil lies in the Hearth of Chaos, an enormous and complex level that is the cherry on the top of this Campaign Starter, a truly dangerous place where magic, evil and madness rule unchecked. While the Extended Burial Vaults are meant to be a challenge for heroic characters (levels 4-6), the Hearth of Chaos could challenge super-heroic characters (level 8+). The Hearth is meant to be a lingering adventuring location throughout the campaign.\nMaps included in the Underworld Expansion pack. Cartography Benoist Poir\u00e9.\nTo these three main modular parts of the Marmoreal Tomb, we added a Player's Guide to the Marmoreal Tomb, a softcover book that will present the basic setting information to new players of the game, including a version of our hand-drawn GP Adventure Character Record Sheet, information about the people and classes of the Duinnsmere, rumors about the Marmoreal Tomb the characters might have heard before they set out to find it, and more. We didn't want the players of the game to feel left out of this opportunity and wanted them to be able to own something that enhances the game from their standpoint as well.\nFirst page of the GP Character Record Sheet. Art Mark Allen, on a design by E. Gygax and B Poir\u00e9.\nTHE PRISMATIC MAZE of Orum Heb. The SUPERHERO pledge level and beyond include an exclusive, one time deal to get the Prismatic Maze of Orum Heb in addition to the different moving parts of the Marmoreal Tomb Campaign Starter. The Prismatic Maze is a rotating dungeon level that can be used along with the Marmoreal Tomb itself, within the Hearth of Chaos included in the Underworld Expansion pack, or as an entirely different adventuring location of its own. It is the resting place of an ancient Liege of Chaos who created a magical prism and broke the light to separate the essences of the world and use them for his own devices in times immemorial. It is a dungeon level rife with both treasure and danger, an original design all of its own, as this prototype (the final map would be colored and more detailed) can attest:\nPrismatic Maze, assembled prototype. Cartography Benoist Poir\u00e9.\nOUR GOALS ARE EMBRACED AT EVERY LEVEL OF DESIGN. The main design goals for the Marmoreal Tomb are reflected not only in the form the Main Module and Expansion Packs take, but in every aspect of their design as well. Whether you would like to rescale the strength of the various opponents for different character levels in your game, whether two GMs run two different versions of the setting and the PCs from one campaign transition to the next, whether you want to use the design as part of a story arc rather than an exploration game, whether you would like to shift genres and run the Marmoreal Tomb in a Science-fiction or modern Horror setting, the form, substance of the Tomb and advice included with the Tomb will help you do just that.\nBelenor wall painting and the ghost of his wife. Art Mark Allen, 2014.\nDESIGN GOAL #3: CRAFTSMANSHIP. Every step of the way, we have been very careful to maintain an authentic gaming feel to this setting. We have drawn on our creative experiences in order to make the look of the setting reflect the game design ethics we feel we can best bring to the table. This implies products that feel and are professionally realized, well organized, with clean layouts and so on, but also communicate that feeling that this is indeed a setting created by gamers at an actual game table, for gamers far and wide, because that's who we are, first and foremost. The Hobby Shop Dungeon is a setting and product line that was born through actual play and campaigning. Its feel is built to reflect that, with entirely hand-drawn maps, pencilled artwork, the works, as if coming straight out of our own campaign journals onto your game table. We want that slightly rough, organic style that lets the imagination of gamers get into the material and do with it as they please. This is how gaming works best for us, and this is the type of game material we intend to bring to the hobby.\nWe are extremely excited at the idea of bringing the first complete piece of The Hobby Shop Dungeon to life with you all. In itself, the Marmoreal Tomb could support an entire campaign, as it did during some of our playtests, much like its classic forebearers did before it. The Marmoreal Tomb is ideal to introduce an entirely new generation of players to the feel and vibe of the original game. It is a project that means a lot to us. We see it as an occasion to make good on the promise to deliver a Gygaxian castle and campaign over the long run. It is our ultimate goal, and we are dedicated to it entirely. We hope you see it as a great opportunity to get some good, solid and fun gaming out of it all, and join us on this journey.\nAltar of Evil, Art by Mark Allen, 2014.\nThe game design phase is complete. The Main Module is entirely written and the two Expansion Packs entirely outlined. All the maps are done, and we have some entirely new art from fantasy artist Mark Allen as you can see here. We will soon move into production and will need professional editing, layout, as well as additional art to make this whole Marmoreal Tomb Campaign Starter all it can be for your game table. This is where we need your help. We invested a lot of time and money into this project already, and we are not about to quit \u2013 we will see it through. We have gone as far as we could carry it with that thought in mind, and now is the time make the product all it was meant to be.\nIf you decide to back this project, you will get the following rewards, depending on your pledge level (plus \"+\" indicate rewards automatically added via stretch goals):\nREWARDS IN ADDITION TO THOSE INDICATED ON THE TABLE: The following table was last updated when the Players' Handouts were unlocked at the $74K mark. To these rewards now also add: \n+ River System around level 1 to all pledges including the Main Module\n+ GM Screen in Print for all pledges of HERO ($60) and over.\n+ Sammi-Zowa versus the Dueling Dragons and Young Ernie's Life Story in digital format for all pledges of SELLSWORD ($40), HERO ($60) and above.\n+ GM Cheat Sheets for all pledges including the Main Module and Underworld Expansion.\n+ Wilderness Encounters and Hexes of the Midlands for all pledges including the Wilderness Expansion.\n+ Miniatures-scaled Dungeon Tiles for all pledges including the Main Module and Underworld Expansion.\n+ Twin Tankard AND Hireling Extravaganza for all pledges including the Wilderness Expansion.\n+ Cyberpunk Customization Pack for the BARON ($150) plege level and over.\n+ Mellifluous Shrine map for all pledges including the Underworld expansion.\nADD-ONS\nIn addition to the rewards you get for your pledge level, we have assembled an array of different products which can add value to your gaming experience. More add-ons will be unlocked if we make it past our main funding goal.\nTo include add-ons, just add their combined value to your pledge, and you are all set! You can change your pledge at any moment during the campaign to add any new add-ons that would be unlocked via stretch goals. We will confirm your pledge with you once the campaign is over with backerkit or similar services (see Shipping below).\nNOTES ABOUT ADD-ONS\nPAPER MINIATURES PACKS: Eric Chaussin is designing some paper miniatures to use in games using the Marmoreal Tomb Main Module and its Expansion packs. These are digital (PDF) documents requiring printing and attachment to miniatures bases as commonly sold online and in local game stores. Both Color and Black & White versions of the miniatures are included in each pack, whether one prefers a certain feel over the other, or one wants to distinguish different creatures at the game table, uses rules for such critters as \u201cminions\u201d and the like.\nSample Paper miniatures, black and white on one side, color on the other. Layout is not final.

Backers will be charged for shipping at that moment, which represents an opportunity to space out payments and not choke on international charges, especially for those who are living overseas and not from the continental US.\nWe will assess the best way to fulfill (we have multiple options already on the table and have alternate plans in case something happens). We will ask everyone to confirm their orders, choose for a shipment method and be charged for it then and there, and fulfill from there.\nBackers of this Kickstarter will be getting their copies first, including retailers. Any copies that make it into distribution channels will be available after we fulfill with the people and businesses who pledged and trusted us to deliver to them first.\nQueen of the Stone Giants. Art Mark Allen, 2014.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe (Ernest Gary Gygax Jr. and Benoist Poir\u00e9) have worked on the Hobby Shop Dungeon project for more than two years, patiently updating and renovating the dungeon, developing the world around it, putting the pieces together so we would know exactly what we want, how we want it, and present the project to the wider gaming community knowing we have what it takes to complete it in a timely manner. \n\nThe Hobby Shop Dungeon and the Marmoreal Tomb Campaign Starter of which this is but the first salvo is our dream project, our masterpiece, and we've worked very hard to ensure this would be a premium product that would fulfill our common vision. We will not quit until that vision comes to life. \n\nWe have developed a reputation of diligence and trustworthiness in the gaming community: we might be delayed, we might encounter obstacles along the way, but we do what we say, and we say what we do. This is simply who we are. \n\nThis is our first Kickstarter campaign. We expect complications, and we are ready for them. We have the support of many friends and professionals in the gaming industry, many of whom have offered their time and advice to us along the way. If something goes wrong, we know we have a whole community around us to help us find an alternative. \n\nWe intend to add to the Gygaxian legacy of the game and build on it forward, towards the future, with our hard work and dedication to this project.

Two things that could cause the non-completion of this Kickstarter are either the loss of our inbound shipments (due to an act of God, pirates or war), or a massive disaster (fire, flood) that levels our facility. Either of those events might be disastrous, however we carry full insurance on our facility and insure every shipment, no matter the size, against loss and damage.\n\nObviously either of the above tragic events would create delays in meeting our estimated delivery dates, and that brings us to the second category: delays. We learned a lot during our two Kickstarters. However, delays are simply part of the cycle of business and it is our wisdom, training, and experience that would help us mitigate and work through any delay. Some delays are easy to solve, such as replacing a printer that is creating barcodes that a particular USPS hub is having a problem reading. Other delays are out of our hands, such as the 2014-2015 longshoreman west coast work slow down that delayed all of our overseas containers. We have even intentionally created delays when we chose to change models already in production to make them better.\n\nLastly there is the risk we will not produce a specific model shown. This will only occur if there is not enough interest in a specific model measured by the number of backers that actually pledge for to buy it verses the cost to produce it. This event did not occur in either of our previous Kickstarters, but is nonetheless still a risk. In the event this situation develops we will issue a refund or credit depending on your desire for the buy in pledge amount of the model.\n\nWe reserve the right to modify pieces shown to meet production requirements.\n\nIn summary we have the knowledge, wisdom and know how to prevent, solve, and work through just about any problem that we will face and will do everything possible to make this an exciting and enjoyable event.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #110", "update_userinfo": "Kickstarter 5 starts in 20 minutes.

Gary not only has a Master\u2019s degree in IT, he also taught English as a professor at a Korean University for ten years and is currently writing his own series of fantasy books\u2026 all of which makes him a great editor.\nThe leatherback edition of this book is limited to 500 and is only going to be available through this Kickstarter. The standard hardcover edition of the book is being made available at a special Kickstarter price, but after the Kickstarter will be made available through my website (larryelmore.com) and conventions for the retail price of $75.\nI want to say one more thing, and this is very important to me. YOU are helping me realize my dream of bringing this collection of almost all my artwork, throughout my career, to you, my fans. You guys have been instrumental in my long successful career as an illustrator. Without your appreciation and support I probably couldn\u2019t hold a job as a Wal-Mart greeter\u2026 \u2018cause I\u2019d be drawing all the time! J\nThank you in advance for your pledge!\nCover Drawing \"Rough\"\n This is the \"rough\" (sketch) drawing of the front cover for this book. The final, finished drawing will appear on both the standard and leatherback versions of the book. High-quality offset prints of this drawing at full, one-to-one ratio size are available with certain packages.\n What does the book contain?\n336 pages of EVERYTHING ink or pencil that I can still reproduce, from my TSR days through last week! Here's some \"layout spread\" sample pages. We're busily putting the book together to be ready to print as soon as funding comes in. The guidelines that you see in these images will not be in the printed book.\nIf we achieve a funding level in excess of $40K, I want to give all backer levels a set of five 8\" x 10\" black and white prints selected from among my favorite drawings.\nIf we achieve a funding level in excess of $75K, I can expand the book to the same size as the Complete Elmore color book, 336 pages! All books, both standard and leatherback editions, will be expanded to this larger size.\n If we achieve a funding level in excess of $90K, I will add an ADDITIONAL set of five prints (for a total of 10) to all backer tiers. Included will be the rarely-seen preliminary sketch for my very popular \"Avalyne the Life-Giver\" painting.\nIf we achieve a funding level in excess of $110K, I will invite all backers to come visit my studio in Leitchfield, KY, on a day TBA in 2016.\n If we achieve a funding level in excess of $125K, I will add an ADDITIONAL set of five prints (for a total of 15!) to all backer tiers, selected from among my favorite drawings. One drawing TBA if we near the goal!\nALL Original Drawing Packages include \"The Works\"--Leatherbound B&W book, standard edition B&W book, slipcase and print.\n\"LIGHTLY-COMMISSIONED\" ORIGINAL DRAWING\"\nFor these five packages (only) Larry will accept a simple fantasy or sci-fi suggestion from the backer, such as \"sexy elf girl\" or \"dragon in flight\" or \"plate-armored cleric guy\" or \"Shadowrun guy with dual pistols\" but not complex character descriptions, specific or especially copyrighted characters. For example, he will not accept \"Everquest girl\" or \"Sturm from Dragonlance\" or \"Zelda\". As these will be a large part of his new work into next year, Larry wants these to be drawings he can make prints of to sell at conventions. The lighter the suggestion the better. Ideally, tell him, \"Do something cool.\"\nIMPORTANT!!! --THIS DRAWING WILL NOT BE STARTED UNTIL 2016--\nThe other package rewards will ship in October like everyone else's, but the drawing will be completed and shipped separately sometime next year. International backers at this level will not be asked to pay additional postage for this separate 2016 mailing of the drawing, only the amount for shipping the books and print.\nSMALL \"NON-COMMISSION\" DRAWING PACKAGE\nThese ten packages include \"pot-luck\" original Elmore drawing. It will be whatever comes out of Larry's brain when he sits down to do it. It may be pencil, ink or a combination. It may be a girl, a guy, a dragon head, a critter, etc. Some samples of drawings Larry did as part of the color art book campaign are included below. Larry intends to include the drawing with the book shipped in October, but as October is on the tail end of convention season he may have to mail it separate if they don't get done in time.\nSAMPLES from first project--these are not the drawings included\nOTHER ORIGINAL DRAWING PACKAGES\nNOTE: Many of these drawings are completed on tracing paper (or vellum, a thick, high-quality tracing paper) as part of Larry's creative process.

On this project we decided to offer a sleek, clean set of packages that will cut down on the complications that caused so many delays in the other projects. We also will have the book laid out and ready to go to press the instant the Kickstarter ends. This is not to say that we can eliminate EVERY possible problem or delay, but we have certainly minimized them and anticipate a fast fulfillment.\n\nSCHEDULE\nThis book will ship to Kickstarter supporters in October 2015.\n\nDOMESTIC SHIPPING \nAll pledge amounts include USPS Media Mail shipping within the United States.\n\nINTERNATIONAL SHIPPING\n- There are limited ways for us to ship internationally. Because these are heavy books, we are unable to ship using the cheaper first-class mail option which has size restrictions and a four pound limit. International orders have to be shipped using International Priority Mail, which is, unfortunately, expensive. Additionally, the large cover print included with certain packages has to be shipped in a separate, heavy-duty tube, which is not a standard container size and costs as much to ship as the book. I truly value my international fans and I apologize that we have to pass this expense along to you. \n- Please do not provide P.O. Box addresses. We cannot ship to international post office boxes, only street addresses.\n- Taxes and fees vary by country.

Take away all the trappings that we think of as essential for RPGs because of tradition: dice, statistics, equipment, even in some cases the GM. From the pure core of fantasy that remains, tempered by game rules, create something new with completely new assumptions: that is the process that created Cartomancy.\nCartomancy is a card-based roleplaying game. This doesn\u2019t mean that you simply substitute cards for dice in resolving mechanics\u2014although that is true, so far as it goes. More importantly, the conventions of card games\u2014hand management, straights, kitties, trumps, window cards, widows and all the rest\u2014form some of the most basic conventions of Cartomancy. \nThis means that it it plays differently than a dice-based game. A die can be rolled an infinite number of times, whereas a card can be played but once, making every action a sacrifice. You never know what a die will show before it is cast, but when the cards are dealt at the beginning of a Cartomancy scene all of the luck is in place and it is up to the players to see if their hands will win or lose. As cards are fundamentally different than dice, so is Cartomancy fundamentally different from other RPGs. \nThe Game\n\u201c[Cartomancy is] a card-based roleplaying game that's awesome and exciting\u2026\u201d \u2014Cameron Miller, Game Designer\nCartomancy is a 200+ page, digest-sized, black and white game book written by Daniel Warmke and illustrated by Jessie Parrotti and Emily Vitori. It creates fast, focused game sessions using a couple decks of cards, some poker chips, and your friends. It is universal in that you can play any setting you like, from love stories between gods played out over eons, to scientists trying to stop a deadly disease from sweeping the world, to adventurers planning on kicking in dungeon doors for gold and thrills. There are 3 included playsets that modify the rules to particular settings and play styles, but the system is extraordinarily malleable. \nIt is not a universal system in that it cannot do things in a small way. Characters have defining powers that make big things happen in the world, and stories are painted with a broad brush of conflict. For those looking for subtlety and minutia, there are a hundred excellent games that focus on details on the market; Cartomancy is not one of them. \nCover art by Jesse Parrotti\nThe Playsets\n\u201cThe base Cartomancy guidelines are exciting, but I get positively giddy over Toytastrophe\u201d \u2014James Bulls, Playtester and card based game enthusiast\nIt is one thing to say \u201cuniversal toolbox\u201d and call it a day, but another to produce setting to go with system. Cartomancy has three different playsets (you could call them \u201cmod\u2019s,\u201d \u201csettings\u201d or \u201cadventures\u201d) packaged in and already available in our playtest hideout. There are more waiting in the wings for stretch goals to be unlocked. \nYou want a game with radical mechanics but a conservative setting? Play Four Kings, an adventure and setting that should feel comfortable to most fantasy game alumni. Want to get crazy and play without a Game Master? Play Consoles & Cards where you can play solitaire or co-op in a JRPG inspired setting. What you really want is a war-game where you empty a chest of kid\u2019s toys on to a table and fight it out with cards? Toytastrophey mods the RPG rules to allow for two or more player tactical games. All are included in Cartomancy and use the same rules.\nThe Jack of Spades and and the friend you wish was imaginary\nThe Kickstarter\nThis game is coming out. It has been play-tested and modded to dozens of settings and has produced fun in every one. But if it is sent into the world without a proper sendoff, it is fated to a lonely existence where only a handful of players have seen its spark. What this Kickstarter campaign allows us to do is give it some adventuring companions to make Cartomancy's journey epic:\nCard decks: Even though you can play with any deck of cards, we want to introduce a deck of cards that is evocative of the concept of adventure in a roleplaying game rather than any specific setting: savage spacemen, cybernetic mages, kodiak bear ninjas\u2014whatever the fevered mind of our artist brings forth. \nA players\u2019 guide: We have all been at the first session with a new game system where everything bottlenecks at a single copy of the book. We aim to eliminate that problem for Kickstarter backers by including a staple-bound (note: see stretch goals below!) copy of the most essential rules as an additional play reference. \nA free for commercial and noncommercial use online system reference document. We want to give these rules over to the gaming community as a whole so that the unique pieces of this game can be incorporated into other games without restriction.\nA hardback cover: If you didn't know, distributers and retailers take a massive cut out of the price of RPGs you buy online or at brick and mortar stores (not complaining\u2014something has to pay the bills at my Friendly Neighborhood Gaming Store), and that cut makes it impractical for us to print a hardback version of Cartomancy for retailers at a reasonable cost. However, the magic of Kickstarter allows us to offer a limited-edition hardback to you and make this the sort of book that we ourselves want to own. \nA community: YOU are the most important adventurer to add to the Cartomancy party. If you are there to play the game, mod the game, and tell others about it, then Cartomancy will succeed. If we don\u2019t have players like you, it will fail regardless of stretch goals and funding levels. Simple as that. \nCard art and interiors by Emily Vitori\nStretch goals:\nMany backers think that their individual contributions don\u2019t matter very much in the grand scheme of things. After all, it would take 700 PDF backers to make this project a reality\u2026 so who cares about a drop in a bucket that large? Such backers don\u2019t understand how important one enthusiastic person is. We have decided to give more ways than money to show your support and have three different stretch goal tracks. Help out with as many or as few as you are willing and able to. Let\u2019s make this the best possible game when it ships!\nFund the project to make the game! Obviously we can\u2019t make games without funds coming in!\n7K Green light and publish. With three playsets: 3 Kings, Toytastrophe, and Console & Cards. We will be offering cards, a Kickstarter-exclusive hardback edition, and soft-backs. The base game is licensed under noncommercial creative commons. \n10K Double card packs (two per order) for all Awesome and above backers and introduce a second card back (red and blue deck).\n15K Free bonus book for all Awesomest and above backers: a staple-bound Player\u2019s Guide containing the player\u2019s guide section of the rulebook and the power guide. More copies of the player\u2019s guide will make character creation a breeze! \n25K Toytastrophe rules will be included in the bonus player\u2019s guide so that you don\u2019t have to let your vile opponent touch your copy of the main game. \nFree tee shirts and more\nIf you post a link to smokeandmirrorsgames.com/cartomancy or to this Kickstarter and back at the Awesomest level (or above) we will send you a tee shirt with your rewards. Tell us in the comments section of this page where we can find your link.\nAlternatively, if you post substantive content in our Google+ Community you will get a tee shirt. Send in a play report, host a hangouts game, or put up a rules hack; you will go on the list.\nHere's the fine print. Some restrictions/limitations apply: there are only 50 shirts supporting both giveaways, only to Awesomest (or higher) backers, and only one bonus shirt per customer. Sorry about requiring the $50 backer level; shipping would kill us otherwise.\nIn addition to scoring a tee shirt for yourself, you will also benefit the community. For every ten links and/or community posts, we will add more content to the Cartomancy ruleset. (Note that, although each individual is limited to one tee shirt, by both linking and posting you can add two points to the added-content tally!)\n10 links/posts: Add one additional dungeon, The Water Temple, on to the Consoles & Cards playset.\n20 links/posts: Add Space Marshals, an additional full playset hailing from the golden age of adventure science fiction to all books (4 total playsets).\n30 links/posts: Add a running battle on the rapids after the adventure at The Water Temple to C&C.\n40 links/posts: The System Reference Document containing all of the Cartomancy rules will be posted on our website under a full Creative Commons Attribution license. This means that you will be able to use those rules in any way that you like, commercial or non-commercial, just so long as you say where you got it. We think this will really let the community grow, but it will require a significant amount of labor to make happen, which is why we need to know that you are enthusiastic before we take the plunge.

The end result: you'll be able to build an infinite number of highly detailed, incredibly sculpted settings for nearly any adventure.\nDawn on the High St.\nRuins!\nProtecting the Keep\nSearching the sewers for Ratmen\n\nOne of the key things to keep in mind: you are the master builder, and what's shown here is just an example of what's possible. The floors, walls, posts and roofs can be reconstructed in many different ways. You can build a single story 4\"x4\" house. You can build multiple stories. You can increase the floor plan and build wider, deeper, or both. You can use Tudor or stone walls, wood or stone floors, slate or terracotta roofs. \nAnd that\u2019s just to start. Imagine an assortment of new rooftops, chimneys, different walls, shutters, interior accessories. Now add streets and sidewalks, townspeople, signs, lights, underground sewer pieces. With even a modest assortment, you can play for years and never build the same setup twice.\nThe sketch below shows how the basic building easily fits together.\nHow do you get in on the action? \n1) Select a main pledge level (e.g. Tourist, Cottage, Book, Hamlet, Undercity, Village, Overcity, Capital City, Empire). These are shown in the right hand column and illustrated in the graphics below.  Please note that Tourist, Cottage, Book, Undercity and Overcity DO NOT come with Free Stretch Goals; For qualifying pledge levels -- Hamlet, Village, Capital City and Empire -- the higher the pledge level, the more of each free stretch goal you receive.\n2) Decide which \u2013 if any \u2013 Add-On Sets you want to include. (All pledge levels except Tourist may purchase Add-On sets.)  Click here to see the Add-On Sets. \n3) Visit our Pledge Calculator to add up the total pledge required for the items you want, or add them up on your own. \n4) Go to the green \u201cBack This Project\u201d button at the top right of this page. Enter to the total for the Main Pledge + all Add_on sets you wish.  Also be sure to select your Main Pledge Level (e.g. Hamlet, Village, etc), so Kickstarter registers your pledge. (Please note that Kickstarter does not capture specific Add-On selections; we will confirm this directly with you after the Kickstarter closes.) Kickstarter will then take you through the remaining steps. \nClick here to see a variety of sample set-ups showing various pledge levels with selected add-on sets are outlined in our photo gallery.\nIf you have trouble seeing the pledge level graphics, please click here. \nDungeon Gray or Completely Hand Painted Dwarvenite\nAll of the pieces in this Kickstarter will be made of genuine Dwarvenite. You choose between unpainted sets infused with \"Dungeon Gray,\" or sets that are completely painted by hand in intricate, exacting detail. The difference between these choices is highlighted below. \nStretch Goals!!!\nAs our overall pledge total grows, so will the size and variety of your sets! When the campaign hits key pledge levels, we unlock Stretch Goals. Some of these are completely free pieces that we add automatically to your base pledge. Others are larger, paid Add-On sets that will add a vast amount of variety to the world you create. \nThe higher your pledge level, the more of each free stretch goal you receive. Here are the details:\nTourists And Book backers do not qualify for Stretch Goals or the purchase of Paid Add-on sets. \nCottage, Undercity and Overcity backers may purchase paid Add-On Sets, but do not receive free Stretch Goal pieces. \nHamlet backers will receive 2X every unlocked free stretch goal (sometimes a mix of Stone and Tudor). \nVillage backers will receive 3X every unlocked free stretch goal (sometimes a mix of Stone and Tudor). \nCapital City backers will receive 5X every unlocked free stretch goal (sometimes a mix of Stone and Tudor). \nEmpire backers will receive 10X every unlocked free stretch goal (sometimes a mix of Stone and Tudor). \nIf you pledge for unpainted sets, your free stretch goal pieces will also be unpainted. If you pledge for painted sets, your free stretch goal pieces will come hand painted. \nOne other important point: just like our previous 2 campaigns, free stretch goals are exclusive to Kickstarter. After the campaign ends, free additions will no longer be available.\n  How do I figure out how much to pledge? \nUse our Pledge Calculator. It lists all currently available items (with photos) and will calculate the total pledge required for your choice of Main Pledge, Add-On sets (and any non-US shipping). Then -- and this is important -- go to the upper right of the Kickstarter page and enter your pledge amount (you also have to select a base pledge level).\nPlease note: if you want Add-On Sets, all you need to do is add the amount of your main pledge and all additional pledges or Add-On Sets together. Then submit this total pledge amount on Kickstarter.  You do not need to tell Kickstarter your Add-On Set selections; we will obtain these from you using our pledge manager software after the Kickstarter campaign closes.\nShipping and Delivery\nAs with our previous campaigns, US ground shipping (probably ground FedEx or UPS) is included. \nShipping outside the US requires an additional payment per base pledge and per Add-On set.  All these charges are displayed on our pledge calculator. While we will make every practical effort to smooth your delivery through Customs, all backers are responsible for any applicable import fees. We deeply appreciate the interest of backers from all over the world, and we apologize that we aren\u2019t able to make any exceptions to these charges.\nWe expect to deliver your Kickstarter product by January, 2016.  While we're working toward an earlier date, we need to budget a little more time this year to test the fit of the vertical pieces, just in case.\nIf you like what you see, please spread the word and join the conversation in the Comments section.  And if you have a chance, download our specially created avatars and downloadable posters, one of which we were honored to receive from artist and backer, Justin Martin.\nBefore closing, a few words from our founder, Stefan:\n\u201cThis year\u2019s Kickstarter is very special to me. While we actually decided to do a city years ago and are now able (with your help) to make it happen, you could say that this project has been a lifetime in the making. I grew up around architects and city planners in the greatest city in the world, NYC. \nMy father ran a small architecture firm right out of our 4 story Manhattan townhouse. His office and drafting studio were on the top and bottom floors \u2013 and we lived in the middle, with architects walking through our house from dawn to midnight. During the day they built miniature balsa wood models (I helped arrange the trees and the tiny people), and by night they drafted beautiful drawings. It fascinated my eager young mind and fueled my creativity. \nMy parents were European, and every summer they took me to Europe to visit relatives. From a young age I was deeply influenced by the ruins in Rome and Athens, and the storybook architecture of Prague, my father\u2019s hometown.\nSo it\u2019s only natural that when I started building my own RPG world, that all those projects and the magical places we visited came alive in my own work. I have never been so consumed by a project, or more proud of its result. This fully modular Old World city is an extension of my soul, in many ways crafted from the love that my parents gave to me when they adopted me so many decades ago. I present it to you with all my heart, and I ask you to have fun, and be the Architects of your own kingdom! \nThank you all so much. Now let the games begin!\u201d", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have been the in the terrain business for nearly 20 years, with a constant dedication to quality and service.

Players take turns drawing cards until someone draws an exploding kitten and loses the game. The deck is made up of cards that let you avoid exploding by peeking at cards before you draw, forcing your opponent to draw multiple cards, or shuffling the deck.\n\nThe game gets more and more intense with each card you draw because fewer cards left in the deck means a greater chance of drawing the kitten and exploding in a fiery ball of feline hyperbole.\nThe game was created by Elan Lee (Xbox, ARGs), Matthew Inman (The Oatmeal), and Shane Small (Xbox, Marvel).  We think this game combines all the things we're best at creating, and and put together this Kickstarter campaign because we can't build this without you.\nSo if you're into card games or laser beams or weaponized enchiladas, please help us make this game a reality.  We think you'll love it as much as we do.\nHugs and enchilada kisses, \n-Elan, Matt, and Shane.\nThe Origin Story\nExploding Kittens started when Shane Small proposed a game to Elan Lee where a joker was inserted into a deck of cards and they took turns picking cards until the joker came up. It was called \u201cBomb Squad\u201d and it wasn\u2019t any fun at all.\nOver the next few weeks, two important things happened: First, after neglecting work, family, and a social life, Shane and Elan developed a rule-set that started working and brought the game to life. Second, Matt Inman saw the game, thought it was super fun, and asked to join the team. (btw, if Matthew Inman ever asks you if he can join your team, the answer is \u201cHELL YES\u201d.)\nWe changed the name to \"Exploding Kittens\" and our little team was born.\nBUT YOU'RE BLOWING UP KITTENS! NOT COOL, BUDDY.\nWe struggled with this a lot. We love the name Exploding Kittens, but we don't want to hurt kittens. We also don't want the kittens to be hurt by anyone else. Eventually we decided to explore the concept of the kittens blowing themselves up.\nFirst, Matt tried drawing the kittens as the actual bombs:\nBut that felt too Angry Birds\u2019ish.\nNext, we tried making the kittens suicidal, but that felt terrible.\nIn the end, we realized that everyone understands feline shenanigans, and that could be our solution.  Our kitties would not blow up out of malicious intent or negligence, but by doing the things that kittens do, like running across keyboards or chewing on things they shouldn't be chewing on.\nFrom there, the rest of the cards fell into place, and the cards used to defuse the exploding kittens were items you'd use to defuse regular kittens.\nHELP US BUILD THIS GAME\nWe wanted to put this project on Kickstarter because it's the fastest way for us to get the game into your hands and make improvements as a community.  We think this game is great, but we need your help making it even better.\nSo, if a world full of weaponized pork missiles is a world you want to live in, please back this project and help us build this game. \n\nWith love and pork missiles,\n-The Exploding Kittens Team  (Matt, Elan, and Shane)\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nFor more information about the game: http://www.explodingkittens.com\n\nFollow us:  Facebook  Twitter\n\nMusic: Royalty-free music from Bensound.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nProduction of the game is simple: it's just a card game, so other than building the box it's a relatively straightforward product to make.

Do anything and everything to entertain your players. Stop at nothing. Pay any price.\nThe advice was both the highest and lowest rated column in the magazine's history, creating division among its readership. But most importantly, it made everyone think about how they ran their games.\nI collected those articles in a book and it has simultaneously become one of the most famous and notorious GM advice books in gaming history. Now, fifteen years later, it's time for a sequel.\nPlay Dirty 2: Even Dirtier continues the trend its predecessor began. PD2 presents even more nasty, underhanded and deceitful tricks to get your players emotionally involved in your characters and your world. John pulls no punches, using everything from new technologies and old conman tricks to give you all the tools you need to get your players to care.\nExamples\nIf you're unfamiliar with the Play Dirty philosophy, let me sum it up in one sentence:\nYou should stop at nothing to make sure your players are having fun.\nI advocated cheating. Misreading dice. Taking away character sheets. Conspiring with players to act against other players. In short, taking the old advice of \"be fair and arbitrary\" and throwing it out the window.\nDire Peril Jessica\nIn the chapter Killing Characters, I talk about the example of \"Dire Peril,\" a mechanic I use in most of my games, introduced to me by the amazing Jess Heinig. The idea is simple: in my games, player characters cannot die unless their death is meaningful. It's just that simple. Conan doesn't get killed by a stray slingshot bolt from a kobold. That's the very definition of absurd. So, generally, I say characters can't die without their players' consent.\nBut if I invoke \"DIre Peril,\" that means \"Your character is about to take an action that can kill her without your consent.\"\nAt my local Houses of the Blooded live action event, Jessica Kauspedas decided she was going for revenge against another. So, when she showed up, I walked behind her with a \"Dire Peril!\" sign held over her head. Everyone knew that if they messed with Jessica's character, there was a chance their own character would die without permission.\nJessica told me she had no intention of killing anyone at the game, but the other players didn't know that. Adding the threat added a unique tension to the game. The threat was all she needed.\nIf you want to see more examples of what Play Dirty looks like, check out the Play Dirty playlist on my Youtube channel. Here are a couple of examples.\nIn the chapter The Kobold and the Beautiful, I took a standard dungeon adventure published by my friends at Super Genius Games and turned it on its head. Instead of playing the adventurers, I had my players take the roles of the kobolds in the \"dungeon.\" They knew the adventurers were coming and had to figure out a way to stop the dirty humans, dwarves and elves from stealing their well-earned goods.\nIn The Dirty Dungeon, I introduced the idea that the players can make their own adventures, complete with a map, history and everything else. It's a system that rewards their creativity and takes all the work off the GM's hands. Its a system that works with any game.\nChapters!\nIntroduction: The Magician\nThe GM and the magician have the same goal: getting people to believe in things they know aren't real. Can we GMs learn from the skills and tricks magicians use? Of course we can!\n\nThe Friendly Game\nMy friend Matt introduced the concept of the \"friendly game\" to me as a rule for table top strategy and board games. I've brought it into RPGs and it has since changed everything about how I GM.\n\nThe Social Meat Grinder\nA phrase coined by Jess Heinig (\"John's games are social meat grinders\"), I show you how to apply social pressures to characters that attack them in ways that have nothing to do with their armor class, hit points or saving throws.\n\nPower to the Players\nA response to the question, \"How do I keep my characters from becoming too powerful?\" The answer: Let them be as powerful as they want.\n\nExploitation for Fun and Profit\nRunning a Mage: the Ascension game gave me an opportunity to turn the whole world against one character. Literally.\n\nKilling Characters\nDon't. But if you have to, do it with style and purpose.\n\nHappy Halloween\nA revamp of an old essay I wrote for Flames Rising website about how to use haunted house techniques to scare the living lights out of your players.\n\nSylvie Hates the Bye-Bye Box (including a Follow-Up with Chris Colbath) \nWhen my friend Chris asked my advice on how to write a story that would challenge his young daughter's \"attack first, never ask questions\" behavior, I came up with a scenario that was one of the meanest things I've ever thought up for a character. This version of the essay includes a \"follow up\" with Chris, how he used the advice, what he changed and how it all worked out.\n\nThe Kobold and the Beautiful\nTake any published dungeon crawl. Any dungeon crawl. Then, have your players take the roles of the monsters while you take the roles of their characters, hacking their way through the dungeon. See what happens.\n\nKick in Your Heels\nYou don't want villains, you want antagonists. An essay on how professional wrestling bad guys (\"heels\") are the perfect model for antagonists in your favorite game.\n\nCon Games\nWant to spice up that one-shot you're planning for the next game convention?

You pick a d-type, flip to a page and you've got a roll.\nAlso, in each margin, we'll have an adjective: \"loyal,\" \"friendly,\" \"deceitful,\" \"envious,\" \"courageous,\" etc. When your players meet an NPC, just flip to three random pages and you've got three adjectives to describe that NPC.\nRandom dice rolls and an NPC generator RIGHT AT YOUR FINGERTIPS.\nWhat's more, WE'RE DOING IT FOR BOTH BOOKS!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe risks for this Kickstarter are simple: writing the book, printing the book and shipping the book.\n\nThe book has already been written, so we have that covered.
