The game last 4 rounds, each round being divided into 3 phases:\n\n Split & Trap: collect cards and try to trap your opponent.\n Planification: choose the cards you want to build and the ones to recycle in order to develop faster.\n Production: produce resources in a sequential order.\n First, both players draw 7 cards from the Development Deck. The cards are divided into 4 categories:\n Structures (Farm, Outpost, ...)\n Specialists (Scientist, Great Army, ...)\n Monuments (Great Lighthouse, Botanical Gardens, ....)\n Discoveries (Moonbramble forest, Subterranean crystals...)\nThese cards are the means to develop your Duchy, enhance its production and earn victory points.\nIn addition to the 7 cards, you'll add a Calamity card to your hand. It's a strictly negative card that reduces your score at the end of the game.\n\nThen, the Split & Trap phase begins. The active player chooses 2 cards from their hand and place them in the offering areas for their opponent.\n\nEach player has 2 Trap tokens, allowing them to place some cards face down. It gives the opportunity to trick the opponent into taking a calamity. It can also be used to protect important cards the player would like to retrieve.\nThat\u2019s the important guessing part of It's a Wonderful Kingdom. Will you outsmart the opponent and read into their actions so you don\u2019t fall into any trap?\nOnce a player placed 2 cards from his hand on the table, the opponent chooses one of the two offering areas, and collect all the cards there, placing them in their Selection Area.\nThe face down cards must stay face down once collected. Choose wisely! When both players\u2019 hands are empty, they move on to the Planning phase.\n\nDuring this phase, players may recycle some of their collected cards to immediately gain the corresponding resources, and keep other cards to build them for victory points or to enhance the production of the Duchy.\nChoosing which card to keep, and which card to recycle will be key to seize the throne!\nLast, comes the Production phase. \nUnlike in other games, resources will be produced in a precise order in It's a Wonderful Kingdom:\nMaterials (grey)\nPopulation (purple)\nGold (Yellow)\nExploration (blue)\nIf you anticipated this phase well during the Planning phase, you will construct cards in chain. With the right timing, some cards can produce during the very same phase in which they were constructed, hence speeding your development up!\nIt's a Wonderful Kingdom is a Modular game. Several modules are modifying the rules, the interaction, and even the difficulty of your games.\n\nDuring setup, choose one of the available modules. There are 3 standard modules, and 1 additional module in the Legends box:\n Quest: complete tasks to earn rewards.\n Advisors: use unique and powerful abilities to change the course of the game\n Menaces: asymmetrical confrontation using the Menace cards to slow your opponent down.\n Conquest (Legends box only): conquer enemy territories to develop your production and earn additional abilities or bonuses.\nIf you want more details about the gameplay, please download the rulebook hereunder (beta version). \nTaxes will be charged to you by your country if you wish to have your rewards delivered outside of the US, Canada, the EU, the UK, China, Hong-Kong, Macao, Australia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, Vietnam, India, Indonesia and New Zealand,   \nLa boite de jeu is a company founded in 2013.

The estimated delivery date for this project is February 2022, though delays are always a possibility. Due to the logistics of international shipping, some backers may receive their rewards sooner than others.\n\nLOST SHIPMENTS, LATE SURVEYS & REFUND POLICY\nIf your order is lost or returned due to unforeseen circumstances, we will attempt to reship your game one time, free of charge. If you provided incorrect shipping information, you will be responsible for the reshipment fee. If your order cannot be delivered, we will refund your order completely, including fees.\n\nReshipments and late survey shipments will all be sent out at the same time, about 3 months after the start of fulfillment to simplify the logistics and avoid errors resulting from sending numerous single orders.\n\nThis campaign will close 3 months after the start of fulfillment. If you do not provide shipping information by that time, we can not fulfill your order and your pledge will be kept as a donation to the campaign.\n\nFINAL PRODUCT\nThe final look, materials and content of the rewards are subject to change and may differ from what is presented while the Kickstarter project was active.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nLong-lasting design\nCanvas: Reflections will be printed on high quality, durable components. The sleeves that come with the game are not only essential for gameplay, they also help increase the lifespan of the cards. Canvas was designed with expansions in mind, so that Canvas: Reflections and future expansions will not require unnecessary duplicate printing of base game components.\nReusability and recyclability\nOur manufacturer, PandaGM, will produce replacement components so that damaged or missing pieces can be replaced with a small shipment instead of a second copy of the game, saving gas and materials. Canvas components are stored in reusable storage bags. The box efficiently holds all game pieces and add-ons without wasted space from a plastic insert.\nSustainable materials\nThe box and punchboard are made from 30% recycled materials for the ideal blend of durability and sustainability. The cards are made with materials from FSC certified sources. Components are printed with eco-friendly water-based ink and varnish. Our premium components are made from wood instead of plastic. The packing cartons are 100% recycled paper pulp.\nEnvironmentally friendly factories\nPandaGM recycles all plastic and paper waste. The factory is fully air-conditioned for worker comfort and has passed ISO worker health and safety standards, is BSCI social compliance certified, and follows the OHSAS requirements for occupational health and safety.

After two or three plays, you will even find players overlapping turns for increased efficiency.\nThe game is also highly interactive meaning you are never left disengaged, even in a 4-player game. Plan your next turn, keep an eye on who is close to completing orders or goals or plan the best use of the Exchange Student you have in your hand.\n\n\nAn elegantly integrated upgrade system where each order you complete with a vendor permits you to upgrade one of the 11 upgrade locations on your storehouse/orchard.\nUpgrades increase the efficiency of your owner actions, allow you to plant more trees and increase your resource production efficiency.\nCURRENT STRETCH GOAL \nOne of the more unique elements of our stretch goals we can reveal now is the Artist Boost. As you can find out in the Scrumpy Team section, our extremely talented artist Bernie Todd, who was only 13 when she started this project is still a college student and we want to help her out. Alongside game upgrades and stretch goals for backers we also will be hoping to unlock artist boost levels to provide an additional financial bonus on top of the money she has already been paid, to help her with further education.\n SOCIAL GOALS\n\nThanks to the social efforts of many Scrumpy: Card Cider backers, the game will be coming with Storehouses that are dual-layered with recessed spaces for upgrade cubes and gaps for sliding the cards underneath.\n\nWe completed the 7 social challenges below to unlock this exciting component upgrade FOR FREE.\n(we will not increase the cost of the game on Kickstarter by adding this deluxe component to the base game)\n Click here to go straight to our Facebook launch post \n Click here to go straight to our Facebook page\n  Click here to visit our Instagram page\n  Click here to follow our Kickstarter profile\nClick here to retweet our Twitter Launch tweet.\n Click here and click the \u2764\ufe0f to become a fan of the game\nClick here to subscribe to the Youtube channel\nPLAY\n\nScrumpy is a strategic card game for 1-4 players. The game is played over a maximum of 6 rounds, sometimes fewer. Each round has 2 phases: Actions and Refresh.\nIn the Actions phase, players take turns to perform four Core Actions and optional Auxiliary Actions.\nIn the Refresh phase, the game is reset for the next round unless an End Game Condition has been achieved.\nYour objective is to gain the most Prestige from actions like selling cider, achieving Goals, and recruiting a highly-skilled workforce.\nAUXILIARY ACTION (Optional)\nAt the start of your turn you may perform one of the following auxiliary actions, or pass and move onto your core action:\n Sell cider to a vendor: If you have, in your storehouse, the required bottles or barrels, you may sell to one of the available vendors and also remove an upgrade cube from your storehouse or orchard, placing it on that vendor and receiving coins or prestige.\n Secondary action: all the basic workers in your deck (the cards you start with) have a secondary action - depicted in the top right-hand corner - and they can be converted directly into the resource shown: apple, wood or coin. Simple flip and tuck the card as the resource in question (or discard if gaining a coin from the supply)\n Sell one resource: you can sell one resource by discarding the card and gaining coins equal to its value\nCORE ACTION (Worker)\nAs your core action, you may perform one of the follow three actions:\n Worker Action: play one card from your hand face-up into the first available of the three slots in your storehouse, and perform it's action:\n Recruit: You may recruit one available skilled/master worker from the roster by paying the cost. Play that card into the first available of the three slots in your storehouse, and perform its action.\n Gain Idle Layabout: Gain a grey idle layabout card from the supply for free and play that card into the first available of the three slots in your storehouse. You do not perform an action but you gain a coin.\nCORE ACTION (Owner)\nOnce per round, instead of playing a card, you may move your owner meeple and perform the action selected from the owner's office in your storehouse:\nREFRESH PHASE\nOnce all players have played four actions (3 workers and 1 owner), refresh for the next round:\n Remove your Owner meeple from the Owner Action space it used this round, placing it back on the seat. \nDiscard all Worker cards from the Worker spaces in your Storehouse.\n Refresh your hand according to the hand limits shown on your Storehouse:\n  GAME END\nAfter 6 rounds have been completed, or one player has upgraded all locations on their storehouse (whichever occurs first), the game ends.\nThen, use the Scorepad to calculate final scores by adding up:\nThe value of all Prestige tokens collected during the game.\nThe Prestige of Private and Public Goals achieved.\nThe Prestige of Deliveries to Vendors.\nOne Prestige for each Skilled and Master Worker card in players\u2019 decks.\nOne Prestige for every 8 coins. (Retain any leftover coins in case of a tie break.)\nThe player with the most prestige is the winner.\n*rulebook subject to changes\nNow live on Steam Workshop\n Invincible games have been fortunate enough to have a solo Automa designed by David Digby who also designed Eternal Palace, Tinner's trail and Chocolate Factory solo modes and others. In the Scrumpy: Card Cider solo mode setup is similar to that of a 2-player game but you must make cider as efficiently as possible to avoid the best spots being taken by the solo cidery owner, Anna Vaperson\nDue to ongoing developments of the core game, the solo mode is still in playtesting and development but an early draft rulebook can be downloaded here\nEarly version of Solo rules - subject to change - Requires SOLO AUTOMA cards\n As we transition from hopeful campaign funding to manufacture and fulfilment, there are various tasks that need to be undertaken.\nWe will endeavour to maintain semi-regular updates without you growing fatigued by a full inbox and aiming towards the following targets.\nObviously, with Ships' potential to fail to negotiate canals and global carboard shortages, we cannot anticipate all eventualities but will do our utmost to keep you informed and aware should any delays occur. Any timeline is an estimate only.\nIf they are happening, we reserve the right to sell some copies of the game at UK conventions. We will endeavour to fulfil all copies before this. If there are any delays we may need to begin selling slightly before one or two copies are fulfilled to assist with cash flow. Should you wish to you can always pick up from these conventions if you are yet to receive your copy.\nThe last year has not been kind to board game retailers and we have been hugely supported by a variety of FLGS as we developed Scrumpy. We are happy to offer a Kickstarter retail pledge to any bricks and mortar stores and independent game retailers. Please back at the retail pledge and contact us where we will be happy to share with you our retail rates and see what other things we can do to support you with being able to stock the game. \nWe request: \nyour store's email address and store address\nwhich country you are based in\nyour store's website (if applicable)\nWe reserve the rights to place order limits on Kickstarter copies of games. We are also unwilling to provide copies to anyone offering pre-orders while the campaign is live. \n\nGroup Pledges\nWe want to help as many of you to enjoy Scrumpy as we can. Global shipping can be an issue on this front and so, we are happy for groups of 6 or more people who wish to have the games sent to one location to contact us for a group pledge rate. \nUnfortunately, due to weights and taxes, different locations will have different prices so please contact us to find out how we can work together.\nEstimated shipping cost only\nActual shipping costs may be different from estimates, we will endeavour to secure the best rates possible as close to fulfilment as possible and to pass any savings directly on to backers.\nIn very rare cases the shipping price can be significantly higher than the early estimates. We reserve the right to cancel any order and will offer a full refund in these cases.\n Unfortunately, the law also requires us to pay tax in some countries and we will need to charge VAT or similar taxes at the end of the campaign. For example: In the UK you will need to pay an additional tax of \u00a36.60 VAT. The easiest way to look at this is that MRSP is \u00a340 so the lower pledge will still be below this once you pay VAT. In the US there will be no such tax to pay in many states.\nInvincible Games is a new small independent UK-based publisher that has been formed to produce Scrumpy: Card Cider and - hopefully - many more games to come. We are a small team of only 2 permanent staff members and a handful of freelancers. We have spent the past 4 years developing Scrumpy, investing our own time and money into the project, to get to this point. We're super proud of what we've achieved and sincerely hope you share our love for Scrumpy and join our family as a backer today.\n\nIf you want to find out more about us, check out our team biographies below:\n\nPublisher and Game Designer\nFrom an early age, Paul would often be found immersed in the land of board games, whether he was insisting his mother serve him from a kerplunk tube or taking an age to walk to school as he could only move forward when he rolled a 4 or better.\n  Since Paul first started to develop his ideas for Scrumpy, he has been blessed with a young daughter who takes up a lot of his time in the best ways imaginable. Who wouldn't prefer to be crawling through canvas tunnels with an eleven-month-old than working? \n  Scrumpy has taken 4 years, a pandemic, a daughter and the setting up of a maths teaching Youtube channel to fully develop but Paul is excited to be finally at the stage where is ready to be released into the wild.\n  This is Paul's first global release but he hopes it will not be his last with prototypes about smuggling in Cornwall, a dice school, a floristry game and a Euro game set inside the Hippo Falls safari park just some of the prototypes on his development list.  \n\nPublisher and Head of Art & Graphics\nDenholm began his career in board-gaming working as a general assistant for Stuff By Bez in 2019. He worked extensively on the Kickstarter campaigns for Wibbell++ & Kittycataclysm, whilst also entertaining a successful acting and theatre-producing career. He is also a self-taught graphic designer; board games have been an excellent way for Denholm to hone his skills in an applied setting.  \nDenholm met Paul Frohnsdorff-Harris at HandyCon - a board gaming convention that Paul founded and runs - and their professional relationship grew from there. Initially Denholm came on board as a graphic designer but eventually, the partnership grew and he has since been integral in the development and delivery of this project. \nDenholm also works as a junior developer for Alley Cat Games, leading the development of Paper Dungeons, and assisting on Tinners' Trail and Eternal Palace. His first independent game Dice Cruise being released by Talon Strikes Studios in 2022.\n  Despite her burgeoning talent as an artist. Bernie is still a college student. She first started this project at the age of 13 under the watchful guise and support of her father, himself an artist in the RPG world. \n  Understandably, this is Bernie's first major board game project having only provided support with RPG illustrations. Recently she also got a commission for Typhon, a game setting for a book.\n  Bernie also streams some of her art and gaming on Twitch under the username Jozebean. She would appreciate any increase in followers that she receives.\nPrototype playtesting\nChoosing from a hand of cards\nMid-game prototype play\n Replayability, Global Impact and Sustainability", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have a good working relationship with our manufacturers in China who will be working with us through a company in the UK to assist with a punctual and high-quality response.\n\nAs with any Kickstarter project, unpredictable events can take place. Global events such as the pandemic have affected everything from Manufacture and Shipping to the availability of cardboard. The estimated delivery date allows some extra time to account for delays, but it can only ever be an estimate.\n\nWhatever happens, we will keep backers in the loop via project updates, and rewards will be delivered, as soon as we are able.\n\nAbove all we are human and while the best attempt will be made to deliver a wonderful product to you promptly and of the best quality, mistakes may happen.

Not anymore! We are presenting new collaborative and peaceful competitive expansions that will add a new meaning to survival.\nBoard Royale is about to become a truly sandbox game that can be played by all types of players and playstyles!\nYES, we are talking about wild beasts, the army of the dead, and secret agendas.\nLet\u2019s get to know the Board Royale base game and our new expansions!\nWhat did we change?\nWe're excited to announce that we have updated our base game with several changes. Thanks to our previous backers and all players around the world for their amazing feedback. With their guidance, we've added new items to increase our base game item count from 80 to 100. New weapons, fun disguise items, and a more balanced Board Royale Experience for all. If you already have a base game please check out the returning backer section for the included base game update package.\n\nBoard Royale became an adventure beyond our imaginations.  Another shout out to our all previous backers and players around the world! Thank you, for constantly reminding us to add a collaborative gameplay experience. We've heard your call. We waited until we're completely satisfied with the expansion tests.\nClick to download on the App Store\nClick to download on the Google Play\nSurvival 101: This pack is perfect if you want to have a taste of the original Board Royale before you commit to the expansions.

If you have the base game in your hands and want to add our new expansions, this pack is made for you. They will all fit in our Kickstarter exclusive box.

Our new base game, four previous expansions, five new expansions plus a mini travel backpack. All inside one giant box that can store all cards sleeved!\nCollector's Edition: Our Collector\u2019s Edition is truly a piece of craftsmanship. The box is huge and covered with vegan leather. Inside, there is a soft velvety texture housing our new base game and our four previous and five new expansions. There were only 250 Collector\u2019s Editions declared for Board Royale - The Island. 150 of them were given previously. In this campaign, the last 100 are available for you to grab. All serial numbers are individually engraved on the boxes.\n We have created all our offerings as add-ons so that you can customize your pledge as you please. You can add these now on Kickstarter after selecting your reward or just after the campaign from our pledge manager BackerKit.\nUpgrade your box to Survival Crate: One of the most requested items has been a box that can easily store all our cards sleeved!

The Sunset Over Water stretch goals & campaign maintained that bar. For Floriferous we've decided to simply build the game we hope / believe should be delivered from the get go. All of the \"Stretch Goals\" are already unlocked and included upon funding.\nInternational shipping has been increasingly complicated and expensive year after year, including additional requirements to deliver EU, UK, and CA Friendly service.  We fully expect to see additional increases to shipping. If you are able to purchase an additional copy or copies with some friends, you'll have a better price per copy on shipping.

Get Me Off This Planet!\", \"The Siblings Trouble\", \"GemPacked Cards\", \"Heroes and Tricks\", \"Herbaceous\", \"Legendary Creatures\", \"Sunset Over Water\", \"Herbaceous Sprouts\", \"Heroes Welcome, \"Skulk Hollow,\" \"The One Hundred Torii,\" and \"The Whatnot Cabinet\" all successfully funded and shipped to backers. \"Herbaceous: Pocket Edition\" is shipping to backers in April. We strive to run excellent Kickstarters and deliver fantastic products.\n\n\"Floriferous\" is well-tested and balanced. The graphic design is complete and the card art is final. Box and instructions are near final and we have been working closely with our printer. Limited amounts of work will remain based on how the KS unfolds.\n\nThere are inherent risks whenever undertaking a project as complex and large as producing and distributing a board game, but we have over 6 years of experience dealing with these. We've gone out of our way to surround ourselves with experienced board game developers, distributors, and people who have run and launched successful Kickstarters. This team of friends has been exceedingly supportive and we're sure will help as we hit any upcoming bumps in the road. And there are bumps. Strikes, shortages, and shipping delays are all hard to predict.\n\nMost importantly, if something does go wrong, we will keep everyone in the loop as the project moves forward and comes to market. This game will exist because you all will have made it happen.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 20 or more", "title": "Floriferous", "descp": "Receive one copy of this relaxing game & the mini-expansion.\nShip: US $8, CA/EU/UK $12, AU/NZ $16, WW $18\nINCLUDES:\nFloriferous\nEarly Spring Mini-Expansion", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2022"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["1,367 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 40 or more", "title": "Floriferous Duo", "descp": "Receive two copies of this relaxing game & two mini-expansions.\nShip: US $10, CA/EU/UK $14, AU/NZ $20, WW $30\nINCLUDES:\n2\u00d7 Floriferous\n2\u00d7 Early Spring Mini-Expansion", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2022"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["85 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 40 or more", "title": "Flowers & Herbs", "descp": "Receive one copy of Floriferous & Herbaceous with their mini-expansions.\nShip: US $10, CA/EU/UK $14, AU/NZ $20, WW $30\nINCLUDES:\nFloriferous\nEarly Spring Mini-Expansion\nHerbaceous\nFlavor Pack Mini-Expansion", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2022"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["148 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 40 or more", "title": "Flowers & Sunrises", "descp": "Receive one copy of Floriferous & Sunset Over Water with their mini-expansions.\nShip: US $10, CA/EU/UK $14, AU/NZ $20, WW $30\nINCLUDES:\nFloriferous\nEarly Spring Mini-Expansion\nSunset Over Water\nNature's Muse Mini-Expansion", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2022"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["204 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 60 or more", "title": "Nature's Bounty: Flor, Herb, Sunset", "descp": "Receive one copy of Floriferous, Herbaceous, & Sunset Over Water with their mini-expansions.\nShip: US $12, CA/EU/UK $18, AU/NZ $24, WW $36\nINCLUDES:\nFloriferous\nEarly Spring Mini-Expansion\nHerbaceous\nFlavor Pack Mini-Expansion\nSunset Over Water\nNature's Muse Mini-Expansion", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2022"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["261 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 60 or more", "title": "Floriferous Trio", "descp": "Receive three copies of Floriferous & three mini-expansions.\nShip: US $12, CA/EU/UK $18, AU/NZ $24, WW $36\nINCLUDES:\n3\u00d7 Floriferous\n3\u00d7 Early Spring Mini-Expansion", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2022"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["21 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 80 or more", "title": "Floriferous Quadro", "descp": "Receive four copies of Floriferous & four mini-expansions.\nShip: US $14, CA/EU/UK $20, AU/NZ $28, WW $40\nINCLUDES:\n4\u00d7 Floriferous\n4\u00d7 Early Spring Mini-Expansion", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2022"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["3 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 120 or more", "title": "Nature's Bounty: Flor, Herb, Sunset Duo", "descp": "Receive two copies each of Floriferous, Herbaceous, & Sunset Over Water with their mini-expansions.\nShip: US $18, CA/EU/UK $30, AU/NZ $42, WW $60\nINCLUDES:\n2\u00d7 Floriferous\n2\u00d7 Early Spring Mini-Expansion\n2\u00d7 Herbaceous\n2\u00d7 Flavor Pack Mini-Expansion\n2\u00d7 Sunset Over Water\n2\u00d7 Nature's Muse Mini-Expansion", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2022"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["6 backers"]}], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #7", "update_userinfo": "June Update: Manufacturing Underway!", "update_content": "Team Awesome,\nAs always, I hope everyone is well!\n   "}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #6", "update_userinfo": "May Update: Files Prepped & Ready", "update_content": "Team Awesome,\nI hope everyone is having a chance to start enjoying the spring!

You will find that materialization engaging, and even delightful.\nDoce is a unique abstract strategy game. It's a turn-based, two-player game. And now you can play it anywhere in the world, with an Internet connection.\nTake turns placing dice on the playing grid with the goal of making a line of 4 dice that add up to 12, but you have to follow some unique rules that will definitely pose a challenge to even the most astute among you. It's a game of simple rules and at the same time very challenging and fun to play. The complexity, possibilities, and strategies can run very deep.

We believe this is of great advantage for everybody, especially for people who want to get a mental power up! \nThis is one of our Doce Digital designs\nDoce Classic has been played by enthusiasts since its successful Kickstarter campaign at the end of 2019.

For us, we've decided to bring forward the development of DOCE Digital, the perfect complement of Doce Classic.\nWe, the Smart Iguana Games Team, have been working tirelessly on the Doce Digital Beta version of our DOCE Classic board game. We hope it becomes a wonderful resource for people all over the world: a fun, challenging, and engaging game that can be played with the safest of social distances.\nWe believe in the importance of giving our backers the opportunity to try the game with friends before committing to a pledge. The BETA version represents an essential piece on the road towards our goal and it's 100% operational for you to play and enjoy (check the link to the game right after the How-to-play video section).

Some mind-blowing challenges to power up your neurons. The program will verify your answer and tell you the solution. Want to test your move? Play it against the AI.\n[VOICE-ACTIVATED PLAY MODE]\nThough this can be used by any player, this feature will be specially developed and implemented for the vision impaired. They will be able to speak out loud their command and move and hear back a synthesized voice with the move played by the opponent, like the computer. The contender will have the option to play normally or using this feature. Languages will be added progressively. A very good friend motivated us to include this feature.\n[TIMERS]\nNot enough time to wait for an eternity for your opponent to make their move? These timers will do the job. As with chess clocks, you will be able to set and limit the playing time for each player. \n[GAME NOTATIONS]\nThis option will allow you to save your games and replay them or any other game in the database. You will be able to analyze your games and improve your skills.\n[PRACTICE MODE]\nIn this mode, you'll be able to analyze variations of the gameplay and test them against the computer.\n[ADVANCED ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE]\nWe'll take the computer AI to the next level with a self-learning algorithm to improve single-player gameplay.\n[TOURNAMENT MODE]\nThis feature will make Doce Digital an App. Here you will be able to create different types of tournaments, the program will take care of the matching, positions, scoring, and more. It may include prizes, tournament subscriptions, and/or purchases if applicable. You will enjoy this feature with your friends, family, and whoever you want to invite.\n[NEW GAME MECHANICS]\nFor those who like to have different options for gameplay, and like a little bit of luck, we will add new ways of playing. Like Dice Luck, where the player must roll a set of dice during their turn, let's say three, and they have to play one of those rolled dice.\nNote: remember that with the Doce Digital All-inclusive reward you will have access to all these features as they get developed and implemented, even if their stretch goal is not reached in this campaign.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2665 REVIEWS \u2665 \nGAMETYRANT:\n Devon Norris written review \n\nThe Meeple Guild - Yorkton this week\n\n\nSmart Iguana Games is a start-up, family-owned, and operated business in Ocala, Florida, and all around the world.

See below for detailed information about shipping.\nCrafting Arzium is a new documentary feature film about board game designer Ryan Laukat and his wife Malorie Laukat (the core team behind Red Raven Games). Follow the two creators as they attempt to bring their latest game called Now or Never to life!\nWhat is Arzium? Arzium is the world setting of many of Red Raven\u2019s games, including Near and Far, Above and Below, and Roam\u2013among others. Arzium is a fantastical world filled with desert oases, lush pastures, turnip farms, amber mines, jagged mountains, glogos caverns, iron cities, and exotic flying continents! It is a world which has entertained and inspired thousands of gamers and which captures the imagination.\nThe idea for Crafting Arzium came about after the completion of The Game Designers documentary (our first project) and was directly inspired by that movie.\n\nIn The Game Designers we set out to capture as much as we possibly could about the world of modern board game design and we traveled near and far to collect numerous stories and interviews. We followed five main designers and interviewed over 70+ people in total. The result of that effort was a film that was far-reaching and touched on a lot of points regarding the subject.\n\nFor Crafting Arzium we thought that it would be fun to delve into the same topic, however, instead of casting a really wide net like we did last time, we wondered how \u201cdeep\u201d we could go with just one individual. So we set out in our early pre-production stage and made a long list of designers who we potentially thought could work for the film. Over time the list got shorter and shorter (for different reasons) and we eventually decided to team up with Ryan and Malorie Laukat!\nCollaborating with Ryan and Malorie was great from the start and has continued to be a great experience. For this film we wanted to find the right individuals who were willing to be open and honest about their challenges\u2013both in regards to the games they made and also in real life matters. Ryan and Malorie were up to the task and have opened up and shared a lot of great information\u2013which really shines through in the film.\n\nRyan and Malorie are also super talented. They bring a great passion and sensibility to every project they create and have inspired gamers for nearly a decade. It was for this reason that we also decided to make a film about them!\n\"Working with Eric on Crafting Arzium has been an exciting adventure, and it's been very gratifying to be involved. Eric puts so much heart and effort into the work he does. It's thrilling to see what he can create from the simple story of making board games. He has really captured the passion we feel about our work, and the challenges of our everyday life. We are so pleased to support Eric and hope you will too!\"\n\n- Ryan and Malorie Laukat\nCrafting Arzium began filming in June of 2020 and we hope to complete all of the filming by summer 2021. We have edited approximately one hour of the movie thus far (February 2021) and hope to have the film completed shortly after our last day of filming. The film is currently in a rough-cut status and needs to address some outstanding items, including:\n\nFilming the last few scenes\nEditing the last few scenes\nRevising the rough cut for optimal character/plot development\nRefining the rough cut and locking in the final edit\nAdding in more graphics from the world of Arzium\nAdding in more animations from the world of Arzium\nAdding in more music to nail the tone of the film\nAdding opening and closing sequences\nAdding \"lower-thirds\" (text to the film)\nBalancing audio and building a clean aural experience\nPurchasing music licenses\nColor Correction\nImage stabilization\nQuality Control\n\nWith the funds raised from this Kickstarter, we can finish off these outstanding items for the movie and also complete all of the stretch goals. This has been a great project to work on and we want to deliver an awesome experience for all backers--with your help we can do just that!\nAll shipping to the US is free of charge.\n\nInternational shipping for physical reward tiers ($33 and up): We ship to European Union, United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia ONLY.  It is a $30 USD flat fee for shipping to these locations and this shipping charge includes all charges (no additional charges will be added for things such as customs, duties, and taxes per region and/or country). Shipping for physical tiers ($33 and up) is not available for anywhere outside of US, EU, UK, Canada, and Australia, at present time.\n\nShipping for ALL add-ons is free of charge regardless of where you live. And we will ship add-ons to anywhere in the world (for digital reward tiers).\nATTENTION! For shares to count toward the share goals above, you must share this post here: Click here to visit the Official Facebook post!\nThe Game Designers was our first documentary project and was successfully funded on Kickstarter in March 2018 (view the Kickstarter here). We had a lot of great support from the community and we unlocked nearly all of the stretch goals. The Game Designers went on to be released on iTunes, Google Play, Amazon, and Vimeo.\nThe Game Designers followed the stories of five board game designers as they worked to develop their latest games. Numerous other designers were interviewed for the project as well and they informed and highlighted specific things about the journeys of the main characters. In total, over 70+ game designers, industry professionals, and other media personalities were interviewed for the project.\nYou can learn more about the The Game Designers at the official website or check out the official trailer.  The Game Designers was a huge passionate project--just like Crafting Arzium--and we really appreciated the help and support of the community to help bring it to life. We hope that you will enjoy it should you get a reward or add-on that includes the movie!\nHi, my name is Eric Rayl. I am the founder of Zoom Out Media and also the writer/director of Crafting Arzium (and The Game Designers). As you might have noticed, I am passionate about board games and movies! I like to tell fun and entertaining stories about different types of creative people and to share their journeys. And so I am super excited to bring Crafting Arzium to the world and to show the awesome talent of Ryan & Malorie Laukat.\nDirector Eric Rayl filming a greenscreen shot with Ryan.\nYou can learn more about Zoom Out Media at our website or visit us on YouTube, Facebook, or Instagram!\nWe would love to have your support in helping us to spread the word about Crafting Arzium! We can only reach so many people by ourselves and we need YOU to help us get the word out there. We don't want anyone who plays tabletop games, or anyone who loves documentaries such as this, to miss out on this Kickstarter simply because they weren't aware of it. Can we count on you in helping us to share the project with your friends and family--and also on social media? Would you share the project so that more people can learn about the movie? Thank you so much!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe believe that the risks for this project are relatively low. About 90% of the footage for the project has already been shot and we are on target to get the rest of the film shot by the end of summer 2021. However, with all things related to film production, there are always surprises that can pop up at any time, so we will try to work through anything like that if it shall so arise.

However, battery capacity is not keeping pace with the power demands of gaming, apps and advanced technologies like 5G. Unfortunately for users, this means carrying more chargers and backup batteries while on the go.\nLow-battery anxiety is real and it keeps getting worse every day!\nThe only real solution is to have a compact, portable fast-charging power bank to reliably power up all the devices you use daily. It has to work fast, travel light, and fit seamlessly into your lifestyle!\n\nSTORM 2 provides a whole new charging experience unlike any other power bank.\nIts Cyberpunk style transparent case marks the new era of power banks.

It is compact, cost-efficient, and the perfect battery station to take anywhere in the world.\n Adjustable DC Output \nA dedicated 3.3-25.2V adjustable & customizable DC barrel port output meets all your specific device charging needs.

Take STORM 2 with you and leave all your other chargers at home.\nFully Recharge STORM 2 in Just 1.5 Hours\nLarger battery capacity doesn\u2019t mean a longer recharge time. With its 100W PD fast-charging DC input, there is no need to panic when your STORM 2 needs to recharge. Just 1.5 hours is enough to fully charge its 27600mAh/99.36Wh capacity.\n\nUse It While Charging\nThe pass-through capability provides users with more charging convenience.

You'll play tricks to each time period as you try to outwit your fellow travelers and collect enough wreaths to decorate all the holiday doors.\n\nGhosts of Christmas is a new version of the acclaimed hard-to-find Japanese game \"Time Palatrix\" by Taiki Shinzawa. Have you ever played \"spades\" or \"hearts\" and thought \"I wish this game had time travel?\"\nAll in a small 5 x 5 x 2 inch box\n\nGhosts of Christmas is a trick taking game where you play cards into three separate tricks: past, present, and future. You visit all three locations in a single round, and winning tricks in one time period could help you win more in the future!\n\nThe gameplay remains the same, but with a new optional variant for a more relaxed game.\nTwelve colorful characters inspired by A Christmas Carol by Charles Dickens.\n\nClick to view pdf. (This is a draft, not a final version.)\nTaylor is an avid player of trick taking games and has a YouTube channel dedicated to them. Ghosts of Christmas can sound confusing at first, but Taylor does a great job explaining how it all works.\nPlease Note: Prototype components are shown in the video. The final version will have some minor changes.\n\nAlso please note: This is one of the most creative Kickstarter preview videos we've ever seen. Give it a chance. You won't be disappointed.\n#1 Meeeaty - Some trick taking games are relaxing affairs. Play your highest card and hope for the best. In Ghosts of Christmas, there are multiple ways to approach each round and use brain cells.\n#2 Ripple Effects - When you don't have the cards to win in a straightforward way, sometimes you can engineer a change in who wins the \"Past\" trick in order to make the \"Present\" and \"Future\" trick work out better for you.\n#3 Dials - They're both fun and informative. A great visual way for everyone to keep track of which suit they can play to each ghost.\n#4 Different Variants/Difficulty Levels - If you want a more low stress evening (or you are just learning), play the variant without bidding. If you think you've mastered the game, try playing one of the TWO variants with the \"Beyond\" ghost that add even more options.\n#5 Bidding Options - Speaking of bidding, the ability to place an \"exact bid\" or a \"wiggle room bid\" gives you the option to play it safe or really go for that high score each round. \n#6 Small Box - It's a fact. Games in smaller boxes take up less room on your shelf, get taken to more game nights, and get played more. This is a small box game. (We work to keep even our \"big boxes\" pretty small.)\n\nPut on your hard hat and install factory tiles in this fast, furious and fun game of factory planning. Connect your tiles to build the best possible production chains. Whoever makes the most profitable factory wins!\nEfficiently packed into our 10.8 x 6.8 x 2.75 inch box\nLike Ghosts of Christmas, we're republishing this cult-classic by Corn\u00e9 van Moorsel because it deserves a wider audience. The gameplay will stay the same (if it ain't broke...), but it has brand new art.\n\nOur Touch:\n1. Added a sixth player\n2. Official variant to play without the quick grab element. Details TBD but will definitely be a part of the game.\n3. Added unique names and logos to each of the six company boards and score tokens to make the game more thematic and improve accessibility for color blind players.\n\nPlay solo, with a full table of six players, or anywhere in between.\nWhat's your favorite machine name?\n\nIt's a puzzle, but not a jigsaw puzzle. Like a \"How am I going to connect all of these? Did you just take the machine I wanted? I have no use for blue! Let's play again. I think I get it now.\" kind of puzzle.\nUnique names improve theming and accessibility\nClick to view pdf. (This is a draft, not a final version.)\nPlease Note: The game shown in this review is the original Factory Funner. Our version has the same gameplay, but all new artwork, and support for a 6th player.\n#1 Quick grabbing is rewarded - This game doesn't have analysis paralysis. When the machines are flipped over at the start of the turn, you have to decide which one you want. Too slow and someone will take your machine. Too fast and you will grab one that you thought would work ... but didn't.\n#2 Non-real-time variant - What about groups who don't like that real-time part of the game? We really think that is the best way to play, but we realize it isn't a fun or even possible option for everyone. We're including an alternative rule that removes all the speed elements and is still fun (in a different way).\n#3 Making it work - At some point during your game, someone at the table will be quiet for 30 seconds. Then they will announce, \"I think I can make it work.\" Pipes start getting laid. Reservoirs are moved around. The table will laugh at how ridiculous their factory looks. And in a few turns you will know if what they did was smart or short sighted.\n#4 You Will Improve - You might not be good at this game the first time you play it. You will get better. You will learn. You will overcome. And it will be rewarding.\n#5 Bad Grammar - Factory FunNER is the sequel and a very solid improvement to Factory Fun. It uses hexes instead of squares to allow more creative building, and some subtle improvements to scoring, length, and machine placement rules really improve things.\n#6 Solo Mode - You can play this game by yourself. Never know when that might come in handy.\n#7 On Tour - Factory Funner has a lot of similarities to our other game \"On Tour\".  It shares the roller coaster emotions and intuitive gameplay.  Whether you're building an optimized route, or installing the most efficient machines, you'll feel the same tension and joy of making it all work out.\n\nNote: Our game will NOT be an exact duplicate from these reviews, but the core gameplay will stay the same.\nZee Garcia's Kickstarter Pick of the Week | Dice Tower\nTurn into a high-flying stock trader as you work against the other players to control the market, buy and short stock, and make the most money.\nHave you been pumping cash into GameStop? Want to have the fun of making big bets without risking real cash?\nYou're going to thoroughly enjoy this brand new game that will bring you into the exciting and crazy world of buying and shorting stocks.\n*No financial knowledge required\n** Really does play within 60 minutes \nOur standard box size: 10.8 x 6.8 x 2 inch\nBear Raid is designed by Ryan Courtney, the same mind behind two other mind-bending games, Pipeline and Curious Cargo.\nThese are four of the character you can play as. What should the other two be? Leave your ideas in the comments.\nFor those who are wondering about the name, Bear Raid is a real phrase used to describe when a stock price is intentionally lowered through short selling and rumors.\nClick to view pdf. (This is a draft, not a final version.)\nPlease Note: The game in this video is a prototype and the final version will have some adjustments.\n\nAlso Please Note: We're super excited that Jac, who does not normally make board game videos, agreed to do one for Bear Raid since she's the most passionate person in the world about this game. She is responsible for getting Chad (Owner of BoardGameTables.com) to play Bear Raid and ultimately publish it. Part of Kickstarter is authenticity, so we wanted you to hear from a real fan.\nLater during the campaign, Chad will be interviewing Ryan Courtney about some of the different strategies in Bear Raid. We will post that here after the interview.\nSubmit a fake news headline and win a copy of the game!\nWe're hosting a contest over on Reddit.com/r/BoardGames where you can submit some ideas for a fake headline that will be used for one of the forecast cards in the game!\nEnter today! \u2192\n#1 Shorting Stock - Not many games let you do this. It is so much fun to short stock and then drive the stock down.\n#2 42 Dice & Event Interaction - Not a lot of luck (but some luck). 48 dice. It is a lot. It's not just a matter of chucking dice and moving the prices. Each company has dice, and they interact with different \"event cards\" every turn. It's a cool mechanic that lets you get a glimpse of what might happen next turn, but not a perfect picture.\n#3 Controlling What's Rolled - Not all the dice are rolled. You can influence what gets rolled. Leave dice on a company or take them back. Leave dice behind your screen or add them to the bag. These decisions are just as important as buying or shorting the stock.\n#4 Unspoken Alliances - There's not negotiation. But sometimes you will find you can go further if you and a \"partner\" work together. Maybe one person can't bankrupt a company by themselves, but two people working together can. Just watch out. Most partners want to do about 40% of the work and leave the other 60% for you.\n#5 Quick - Many financial/economic games are long, but Bear Raid packs all that action into 60 minutes.\n#6 Q.E. - Although our other financial game QE is certainly a different game, we really enjoy the genre. We think great financial board games are really under-the-radar. Wouldn't you agree?\n#7 Surprisingly Funny - You expect silly games to be funny. You don't expect a stock market game to have humor in both the gameplay and player's reactions to it. You could almost call it a party game.\n#7 Bears - Bears. Beets. Battlestar Galactica.\nSave 25% off the future MSRP!\nFor the gamers who want the absolute best from every game, you're in luck!\nWood components for the most handled pieces of Ghosts of Christmas and Bear Raid feel better in your hand.

Clash of Deck is a card game which has been played and tested by hundreds of players throughout its first year of existence, as a French version. The game was published in 2020 in an atypical form: cards you cut yourself from a folded sheet of cardboard. A new standalone expansion was published each month. \nToday, thanks to the feedback and support of its community of players, Clash of Deck takes off with a new edition, available in English. The game will have more conventional components, such as \"real\" cards, larger and of better quality, with a tuck box. \nThe game will be fully translated in English and French!

We recommend the Draft format for your first plays. Each turn, the players draft cards from a common deck to build themselves an efficient deck. For the Draft format, you only need one copy of the Starter Kit. The Constructed format is destined for experts who've mastered the game's mechanisms and the synergies brought by special abilities. Players build their own decks by choosing 10 cards among all the cards from the game. Their opponent will banish two of those cards at the beginning of the game, to form the final 8-cards deck. For the Constructed format, each player must have a copy of the Starter Kit.\nEach player receives a \u201cWatchtower/Stronghold\u201d card. \nPlace the 2 \u201cBridge\u201d cards in the play area. \nShuffle all the other cards into a draw pile. \nThen, reveal the top 4 cards of the draw pile. First, player A chooses 1 of the 4 available cards. Then, player B chooses 2 of the 3 remaining cards. Finally, player A takes the last remaining card. Repeat the operation, but this time, player B chooses the first card. Repeat until each player has 8 cards. Each player shuffles their cards, constituting their hand. They then place their \u201cWatchtower\u201d card in the leftmost place in their hand.\nThe player who crossed a bridge last becomes the first player. For their first turn, they begin the game with only 6 Mana.\nPlayers play their turn one after another. A turn consists of 3 phases:\nPhase 1 \u2013 Mana Regeneration:\nThe player gains as much Mana as the number of cards in their hand (including the \u201cWatchtower/Stronghold\u201d card). Mana is used to pay cards costs. The player can use it during phase 2.\nPhase 2 \u2013 Summoning:\nThe player can spend the Mana gained during phase 1 to play cards from their hand. A player can only play the 4 leftmost cards in their hand (ignoring the \u201cWatchtower / Stronghold\u201d card). \nA card\u2019s Mana cost is indicated in their upper left corner. Mana that isn\u2019t spent during a turn is lost. A player cannot spend more Mana than they gained during their previous phase 1. The play area consists of two lanes. When playing a card, the player chooses in which lane to place it. \nPlayers only summon units in their respective Realm: player A places their card on the left of the \u201cBridge\u201d cards and player B places their cards on the right of the \u201cBridge\u201d cards. There is no limit to the number of cards in a lane. A summoned unit is placed from the player\u2019s hand in the play area, face up, in the lane of their choice, behind their other units already in play. The card remains in play as long as it isn\u2019t destroyed.\nPhase 3 \u2013 Assault:\nA unit has Health Points (HP), and an Attack Value (ATK). A unit cannot attack the turn it enters play. Each unit a player controls inflicts their ATK value to an opposing unit. Units automatically activate in a predetermined order: first the upper lane, from the unit further away from to the unit closest to the \u201cBridge\u201d; then, the lower lane, from the unit further away from to the unit closest to the \u201cBridge\u201d. \nWhen a unit suffers at least as much damage as its HP value, the unit is destroyed. It suffers the entirety of the damage caused by the attack and the card returns to its owner\u2019s hand, in the rightmost place.\nThen, move all the units on the lane closer to the \u201cBridge\u201d so they fill the gap. Units regenerate their HP at the end of the turn. During an assault, a unit inflicts its ATK value to the closest opposing unit on the same lane. If no opposing unit can be attacked, the unit then inflicts its damage directly to the opponent\u2019s \u201cWatchtower/Stronghold\u201d.\nWhen a \u201cWatchtower/Stronghold\u201d suffers damage, shift it that many places to the right in the player\u2019s hand. \nWhen a \u201cWatchtower\u201d reaches the rightmost place in a player hand, it is destroyed: flip it to its \u201cStronghold\u201d side and return it to the leftmost place in the player\u2019s hand. Excess damage inflicted to the \u201cWatchtower\u201d does not carry over to the \u201cStronghold\u201d. When a \u201cStronghold\u201d card reaches the rightmost place in a player\u2019s hand, that player loses the game.\nEnd of the game\nThe game ends as soon as a \u201cStronghold\u201d card reaches the rightmost place in a player\u2019s hand. Their opponent then wins the game.\nThe Solo Mode allows you to play Clash of Deck alone, through a Quick play or a Custom play.  Before playing custom games, we recommend you practice with a few Quick games to learn and discover the rules and the peculiarities of Clash of Deck\u2019s solo mode.

The game evokes the feeling of visiting Amsterdam with friends and experiencing the Dutch culture. Gift of Tulips features artwork inspired by the blue and white delftware pattern that is unique to the Netherlands, the windmills and waterways of the countryside, the flower fields of Keukenhof, and the buildings of Amsterdam.  \nWhen I visited Amsterdam and the Netherlands, I really felt like I was coming home for the first time in my life.  With Gift of Tulips, I wanted to create a game that exemplified my wonderful experience.\nBuild your bouquet, gift tulips to your friends, and create a beautiful Festival display in this gorgeous card game for 2-6 players.\nRead the review https://www.pudgycatgames.com/post/gift-of-tulips\nGift of Tulips Overview\nIn Gift of Tulips, tulip enthusiasts explore Amsterdam\u2019s Tulip Festival to build colorful bouquets and give tulips to their friends.\nPlayers choose between building up their bouquet to try to score major points in the end game Tulip Festival, giving tulips to other players' bouquets for immediate points, and placing tulips in the Tulip Festival to adjust each type's ranking. Each turn, players draw one Tulip card, take an action, then draw another Tulip card and take a different action.\nGame Setup\nGift of Tulips starts with two tulips in the Festival, then players are each dealt two Tulip cards.  Players choose which will start their bouquet and which to place into the Hidden Showcase that may affect the end game Tulip Festival. \nGifting Tulips\nYou can choose to gift a tulip to another player. You gain the value of the tulip given, plus additional points based on the type's current rank in the Festival.\nKeeping Tulips\nYou can choose to keep a tulip for your own bouquet. If you keep a tulip that is ranked 3, 4, or is currently unranked, you will also gain points.\nAdding to the Festival\nThe last choice is to add the Tulip to the Festival.  You can change how the Tulips are currently ranked by adding the Tulip straight to the Festival OR choose to add it to the Hidden Showcase for a chance to influence the ranks at the end of the game.\nGame End\nAt the end of the game, up to 5 Tulips from the Hidden Showcase are added to the Tulip Festival, adjusting the final ranking. Points are awarded to the players that have the most cards of each Tulip type. The player with the most points wins! \nRules and Print and Play\nThe rules are here:  Rules Link (the rules are not final)\nA low-res print and play is here:  Print and Play Link  (this does not feature final artwork, graphic design, or balancing)\nYou can also try the game out on TTS: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2405647152&result=1\nAnd Tabletopia:  https://tabletopia.com/games/gift_of_tulips\nWatch the video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpiM2HzDZMQ&feature=youtu.be\nRead the Review: https://thecardboardcantina.com/gift-of-tulips/\nRead the review https://whatsericplaying.com/2021/03/01/gift-of-tulips/\nWatch the video below\nWatch the review: https://youtu.be/TxoPTIRtQDU\nRead the Review: http://www.purplephoenixgames.com/gift-of-tulips-preview/\nWatch the video below\nWatch the review below!\nRead the review: https://www.meeplemountain.com/reviews/gift-of-tulips-review-a-beautiful-bouquet-give-or-take-a-tulip/\nWatch the Video Here https://youtu.be/qcW9Wh9RscM\nWatch the video below!\nPeople sometimes wonder why they should back a Kickstarter campaign instead of waiting to get the game later in retail. The most important reason not to wait with Gift of Tulips is that even if Gift of Tulips funds, we currently don't know if Gift of Tulips will go into distribution. If you wait, you may end up missing out, as we won\u2019t have many extra copies to sell and unless your local store backs the campaign, they won\u2019t be carrying it either.\n Kickstarter Limited \u2013 Gift of Tulips might be very hard to find after the campaign, outside of select conventions. \n Help Us Improve Gift of Tulips \u2013 We have a ton of stretch goals planned to help improve the game for everyone!\nMost importantly, without you, Gift of Tulips would not get created.\nGift of Tulips is a game we truly love and want to share with the world. We've worked on this game for years to make it perfect for you. Gift of Tulips has definitely been a labor of love, as we tried to recreate the experience of visiting Amsterdam and finding a place to belong. We love playing and know you will, as well.\nWe really appreciate your support in making our dream a reality.\nWe would love to support game stores by offering the Kickstarter versions of Gift of Tulips to retailers during the campaign. Back the project at the retailer level for $45, and we'll contact you closer to when we ship out rewards to get a count of games that you wish to get! An invoice will be sent to you before we ship your rewards.\nShipping is estimated to be $10 for retailers in the US, $15 for retailers in the EU, $25 for retailers outside the US and EU.\n\nSocial Goals\nHelp us reach six out of the eight social goals, and we'll add a Best Friend (name subject to change) card to the game! If we meet all eight goals, we'll include a special surprise, as well!\nHere's the links: BGG Page (Sign in to your account, then click the heart button), Facebook, Facebook post, Twitter, Twitter tweet, Instagram, Subreddit, Youtube Channel, and Facebook Group.\nWe will be charging shipping after the campaign ends and subsidizing some of the cost. This ensures you get charged the shipping you deserve. No more, no less.\nBy doing this, we are able to factor in your pledge tier, add-ons, and all fancy things that may occur during the campaign. However, we can offer estimated shipping costs. Below is estimated pricing for one copy of the game.\nPlease keep in mind these are estimates and there can be slight variations from country to country. Also, the more items you purchase, the more shipping will cost. If you have any questions, please email us at contact@weirdgiraffegames.com.\n*We are currently not planning to ship to the following areas: Mexico, Brazil, and Russia.\nTo order a second copy of Gift of Tulips, add an additional $15 to your pledge with no additional shipping cost.\nWe are happy to discuss group orders, but these need to be handled on a country-by-country basis. Please send us a direct message including country and number of copies to discuss.\nGift of Tulips is the eighth project by Weird Giraffe Games.\nWeird Giraffe Games was founded to create games that are easy to learn and play, but layered with strategy.\nThe Gift of Tulips team is made of the following people:\nWe're looking forward to talking to you throughout this Kickstarter and after!

There was something about the place that just felt like home, even though I\u2019d never been there before. It reminded me of visiting my Dutch grandparents, with the blue and white delftware patterns, wooden clogs, tulips, and windmills. I remember growing up and knowing that if someone had a windmill in their yard, they were family, and going to Amsterdam definitely left its mark on me. \nIt wasn\u2019t just the objects I remembered from my childhood, but all the sights as well. From the canals to the fascinating, detailed, and sometimes outlandish architecture, there was something that caught your eye wherever you went. But going even further, the culture also greatly resonated with me. Most people in the Netherlands speak at least Dutch and English, but a good amount of them also speak French, German, and/or Spanish, as well. Historically, a lot of the Dutch people were traders and wanted to speak to you in the language that you were familiar with. It\u2019s that sort of attention to detail and empathy that made me think I was finally somewhere I belonged. \nWith Gift of Tulips, I wanted to create a game that really exemplified that experience in the form of a game. The player that wins will most likely be the one that gives out the most tulips and gives them to a variety of players. If a player simply hoards what they have, they may not get far. \nThe artwork of Gift of Tulips is reminiscent of the flower fields of Keukenhof, the blue and white delftware pattern that is unique to the Netherlands, the windmills and waterways of the countryside, and the buildings of Amsterdam.\nESTIMATED TIMELINE\nBelow is what we think the timeline for Gift of Tulips will be. It's an estimate and we have a buffer, as things can always happen that we don't anticipate. We always hope to deliver early, but we do know the reality of life means that surprises can happen.  \nTHANK YOU SO MUCH!\nWe'd also like to thank the following people for all of their help:\nZach from Board with Friends for making the How to Play video. \nEric from What's Eric Playing, Aaron from Game Enthus, 90 Second Nerd, Open Seat Gaming, Edo from Gaming with Edo, Travis from Purple Phoenix Games, BJ from Board Game Gumbo, Kurt and Traci from MFGCast, Krista from the Board Game Cantina,  Jacqueline from Pudgy Cat Games, and David from Meeple Mountain for reviewing/previewing Gift of Tulips.\nJack from Cardboard Herald, BJ from Board Game Gumbo, Traci and Kurt from MFGCast,  and Zach from Board with Friends for helping raise awareness of Gift of Tulips", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIf you've gotten this far, you are seriously considering supporting us and we really appreciate that.

Your favorite songs blasting through the speakers. Candy bar wrappers piled next to a warm drink in the cheap plastic cupholder. Your companion riding in the passenger seat, snapping pictures of landmarks as you settle into the hypnotic rhythm of the road. But be careful: this fun road trip could get dangerous as you drive through Death Valley.\n\nDeath Valley is a pocket-sized, push-your-luck, tableau building game for 1-2 players, with each traveler striving to assemble the best mix of cards in their Journey and Scrapbook in order to win the game.\nDeath Valley is 18 cards, packaged in a portable and durable wallet.\n\nEach turn, players will choose whether to assign a card to their Journey, or move cards from their Journey to their Scrapbook. Cards feature stars (points), special abilities (affect the value and position of cards), and some interesting facts about Death Valley.\n\nEach card also has a hazard (Heat, Terrain, Flood or Animals) listed. Having 3 of the same Hazard visible in their tableau will cause the player to bust and lose all the progress in their Journey.\nAll 4 hazards and their card distribution within the game.\nAt the end of the game the player with the most stars in their Journey, plus any additional points from card abilities, is the winner.\nTo set up the game, shuffle all 18 cards and place 1 face-up between the players. On a player\u2019s turn they have 3 choices: add the face-up or face-down card from the top of the deck to their own Journey, or Rest. When a player Rests, they move at least one card from their Journey to their Scrapbook (stacking them into a single pile if they select multiple cards) and shuffle as many of their remaining Journey cards into the deck as they choose.\nAfter the player takes their action for the turn, they check for Hazards among the visible cards in their Journey and Scrapbook. If they have 3 of the same Hazard type showing (3 Flood cards, for example) the player busts: 1 of the Hazard cards is removed from the game and the rest of the player\u2019s Journey cards get shuffled back into the deck.\nOnce there is only one card remaining in the center area, the game ends. Each player counts up the stars showing in their Journey row. Visible cards in the Journey and Scrapbook might have abilities that adjust that score. Once all effects have been applied, the player with the highest star count is the winner.\nBackseat Driver Variant\nIf you want to really press your luck and give up a little control, try out the Backseat Driver Variant. In this variant players may choose to play the face-up card on their opponent\u2019s journey as well as their own. At the end of each turn you will check to see if either player busts.\nSolo Mode - Designed by Kevin Ellenburg and Mike Mullins\nThe game will come with rules for solo play. Here you will face an AI explorer that thinks through its action each turn similarly to a player (playing the more intense Backseat Driver Variant). This explorer never rests in its pursuit of adventure.\nIf you would like to try the game yourself, the mostly black and white preview PNP is available at PNP Arcade now!\nhttps://www.pnparcade.com/products/death-valley-kickstarter-preview\nIn previous campaigns we created expansion material and used it as stretch goals. Since 2018, we've just given it away from the start. So no worries on whether we'll hit it or not, you are getting bonus content if you pledge here. The free expansion for this campaign is Death Valley: Panamint City.\nThis expansion consists of 6 more cards, letting you customize the deck before playing Death Valley. Before play, organize all the base game and expansion cards by hazard type. Then select 3 Animal, 4 Flood, 5 Terrain, and 6 Heat cards to shuffle into the deck. Unselected cards will not be used. Includes Vultures, Panamint City, Red Cathedral, Ubehebe Crater, Zabriskie Point, and Panamint Dunes.\nHere are the rewards available during this campaign.\n\nTo add more games to your order, you can do one of a few things:\nUS Backers only - to order games that ship now - go to our website http://www.buttonshygames.com and place an order using the coupon code \"0321us\" to get 15% off  of your order. Your website order will ship now, as long as you don't  order any pre-order items, otherwise the entire order will ship as  soon as everything comes in. As always, if you reach $25.00, you will  also receive free shipping. (NOTE: We previously offered a US Backer  code to combine games to save on shipping, but in most cases this was a  much better deal of free shipping AND 15% off.)\nInternational Backers only - go to our website http://www.buttonshygames.com and place an order using the coupon code \"0321international\" (REPEAT: THIS IS FOR BACKERS ONLY) to get free shipping on your extra game(s). Note: The limit on this  offer is 3 wallet games (and up to 3 expansions) total, including  anything that you order at Kickstarter. Anything above 3 wallet games  (and 3  expansions)  will end up bumping into the next shipping tier,  which can be as much as  $10 on international orders. These games will  all ship together with your Kickstarter rewards.\nThere are many notable games and we'll be featuring those throughout the campaign.\nWhile the game includes lots of great little historical facts about Death Valley, here's a little history about the game itself.\nDeath Valley was originally Kevin Ellenburg's entry to the 18 Card Challenge: Design A Game About A Real Life Location, and we\u2019re happy to see it coming to life. It has a unique take on the familiar push-your-luck mechanic where players have to think about managing their hazards as well as the card abilities, making each choice matter beyond the immediate threat of busting. On top of that, the gorgeous art from Fachri Maulana perfectly captures the lonely beauty of Death Valley National Park.\nFirst up is Kevin's initial pitch video in it's entirety (note some changes were made to the gameplay and cards throughout development):\nAnd here is the 18 Card Challenge video where it was a finalist, along with two other games that we eventually published, Skulls of Sedlec and Horreos. All 3 of which are available here. \n\n\nWe have an awesome following of repeat customers. As a result, we've built the Board Game of the Month Club.\nIt's a subscription service where you receive unreleased microgames,   promo cards, expansion content, and Kickstarter discounts ... every   month! Supporters also receive from $1 to $10 off EVERY WALLET GAME  that  we make. (Members back our Kickstarter projects at the $1 pledge  level  above.)\nOur 2021 $5+ packages include an episode of The Final Lightyear.\nGather your crew and gear and launch into a  fringe section of space where the law teeters over the edge and a good  captain can earn a living. There's no shortage of threats that endanger  the goodfolk of deep space, but luckily your torpedo bay is full and  lasers are hot.\nIn Lightyear you'll play solo or cooperative with a friend, as the  captain of a so-called starship, in hopes of earning some rewards and a  decent rep. Using tactical maneuvering and dice-based action selection,  you'll work through the sector's small, medium and large enemies trying  to gain rewards and ultimately live to see another day. Customizable  episodes will challenge you with variable enemies and threats while  offering powerful new gear and talented crew to help you in your  adventures.\nOur $10 packages include all of the above and something   extra. Generally it's a tiny game (up to 9 cards), or some expansion  / promo cards for our existing games.\nAnd our $20 package includes all of the above and a copy of   the featured wallet game (or the wallet game of your choice).   The featured wallet games also come with any expansion material that  is given away in the Kickstarter campaigns (like the Panamint City expansion  here).\nIf that sounds cool to you, check out the Board Game of the Month Club on Patreon!\nhttp://www.patreon.com/buttonshy\nThank you for checking out Death Valley!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWith our method of publishing and using multiple manufacturers, there's always a chance that one part of the game could come in with an error, leading to delays.

Final version subject to updates.\n\nNew to Everdell?\nCheck out this great How to Play video from Watch it Played!\nWithin the charming valley of Everdell, beneath the boughs of towering trees, among meandering streams and mossy hollows, a civilization of forest critters is thriving and expanding... Everdell is a game of dynamic tableau building and worker placement played over four seasons. Whoever makes the most impressive city wins! \n\nOn your turn, you can take one of three actions:\na) Place a Meeple: You have a collection of wooden Critter meeples. You can place these on the board locations, events, and on Destination cards. Critter meeples allow you to perform various actions to develop your city: gathering resources, drawing cards, and taking other special actions.\nb) Play a Card: Each player is building and populating a city; a tableau of up to 15 Construction and Critter cards. There are five types of cards: Travelers, Production, Destination, Governance, and Prosperity. Cards generate resources (twigs, resin, pebbles, and berries), grant abilities, and ultimately score points. The interactions of the cards reveal numerous strategies and a near infinite variety of working cities.\nc) Prepare for the next Season: Critter meeples are returned to your supply and you gain bonuses depending on the season. The game is played from one year\u2019s winter through to the end of autumn. Players add up the points from their cards and other bonuses and whoever has the highest total wins!\nNew content that will delight and surprise you for many more seasons to come!\nGolden Occupied Tokens\nThe new Critter and Construction cards in Newleaf are played like normal Critter and Construction cards from the base game, except that you use Golden Occupied tokens instead of normal occupied tokens. These Golden Occupied tokens are limited -- a player can never use more than 3 in a game! These new cards are very powerful, so choose wisely which you'll spend your Golden Occupied tokens on! \n\nThrough Every Season Cards\nSince the beginning of Everdell\u2019s history, farming has been a vital part of the valley\u2019s way of life. Farmers face a number of challenges through the four distinct seasons of the year and must adapt as the weather changes. Experience the story of an Everdell farm throughout the year!\nThe 8 new special Farm cards in Mistwood replace the basic Farms in your Everdell game. These often give you the choice of two abilities, and you choose which of these abilities to use each time the card activates.\n\nMore Legends\nLegendary cards represent unique Critters and Constructions that are powerful upgrades of other Critters and Constructions. Use them when you are familiar with the base game, and are looking forward to a twist on a regular game! The More Legends cards in Mistwood are added into a game of Everdell in the same manner as the Legends from Everdell: Collector's Edition.\nNew ideas are arriving every day!\nStation Cards\nFaceup Critter and Construction cards on the Station board work like Meadow cards and may be played on your turn, but whenever you play a card from the Station, also gain the reward listed on the Train Car tile beside the card! This reward is gained after you have fully resolved the played card and any additional cards that may have activated as a result. After you've gained the reward, replenish both the Train Car tile and the card played.\nRemember: cards on the Station board are not Meadow cards, and therefore any abilities that affect Meadow cards (such as the Inn) do not apply to Station cards!\n\nVisitors\nNewleaf is a bustling and growing city in Everdell, and now that the railway system is in full operation, many new critters and big ideas are coming into the Emerald Valley. The Visitor cards that come into play on the Station Board offer players a new end game scoring opportunity!\nTo gain a Visitor card on your turn:\nPlace a worker on the Station. The Station is a shared location, allowing several workers at once, but you may only have 1 of your workers on this location at a time.\nChoose 1 of the faceup Visitor cards and discard it facedown on the Visitor discard pile.\nReveal 1 new Visitor card and choose 1 of the 2 faceup Visitor cards to take and place by your city. If you do not want either of the faceup Visitors, you may draw 1 from the top of the Visitor deck instead. If you selected one of the faceup Visitors, replace its card with another one from the Visitor deck.\nGain the reward shown on 1 of the Train Car tiles by the Station; set that tile aside and draw a replacement tile.\nVisitor cards will score their listed point values, if your city contains their requirements at the end of the game. Visitor cards that you have obtained and failed to please (by not meeting their requirements) are not worth any points at the end of the game.\n\nThe Knoll\nYou may place a worker on the Knoll to choose any 3 cards from the Meadow and/or the Station to discard. Replenish the discarded cards from the main deck, and draw any 3 cards into your hand from the Meadow and/or the Station. After drawing your cards, you may then gain the reward shown on 1 of the Train Car tiles. Set that Train Car tile aside and draw a replacement tile from the bag. Finally, replenish the 3 cards you drew into your hand.\nThe Knoll is a shared location, allowing several workers at once, but you may only have 1 of your workers on this location at a time.\nEverdell has a brand new villainess!\nNow while playing Everdell, you can pit your wits against Nightweave, our newest automated player for solitaire and two-player games. Nightweave is designed to function like a real player at your table: she has her own hand of cards, Prepares for Seasons on her own schedule, and, most importantly, she has her own agenda!\n\nNightweave has her own Big Critter meeple along with 8 spider meeples (not just 6!) that will move about the board to do her bidding -- blocking exclusive Locations, taking events away before you can get them, and even enacting Plots and Plans that will interfere with your options as a player, reminiscent of the Weather cards from Spirecrest.  She has eight different personalities that influence what she targets and focuses on, so there's lots of variety in gameplay!\n\nWhat Happens on Nightweave's Turn?\nTurn over the top card of Nightweave's Activity deck. These cards are the heart of her decision-making during the game, instructing her to play cards into her city, place spider meeples on previous, exclusive Locations, take a Basic or Special event, etc.\nNightweave will perform the first action listed for her current season, if possible. If she cannot perform this action for any reason, she will take the second action for her current season. If she cannot take that action either, she will perform as much of the Default action at the bottom of the card as she can. This could include discarding cards, collecting point tokens (yes, really!), and/or a number of other actions.\nIf Nightweave herself is in the Meadow and there are no spiderlings left in her lair when she draws an Activity card with a Spider or Nightweave icon, she will Prepare for Season. \nThe game ends when you run out of actions and when Nightwave Prepares for Season at the end of Autumn.\n\nCan you stop Nightweave from taking over Everdell? Check out the Rulebook for more in-depth information about this automated player! \nhttps://static1.squarespace.com/static/5eefaf5a2819042bf0d4099b/t/6047b72c79a2da41d1f2a50c/1615312716704/Prototype+Rulebook+%281%29.pdf\nAll items shown are available as add-ons in Kickstarter and will also be available to add to your pledge in the Pledge Manager after the campaign.

Based on previous campaigns, we anticipate that you should not have any additional fees associated with receiving your reward package (customs, clearance, etc.) if you\u2019re in one of these regions. If you\u2019re outside of one of these regions, you may need to pay customs fees, specific taxes, and/or other local fees. Please see the FAQ and check with your local authorities for more details. \nIf your reward is shipping to one of the destinations shown on this More Shipping Destinations chart, we are not collecting taxes or customs fees, but it may ship from a local hub. The Destinations Summary below details which countries are in which regions. \nIf you're outside of the countries included in this Destination Summary, please reference the Expanded Worldwide Shipping details below. \nWe originally did not offer shipping to destinations outside of those listed in our Destination Summary due to cost and reliability concerns. We are now able to offer shipping to all destinations outside of those listed above only if the backer accepts that we are unable to provide free reshipments for any packages lost in transit (We typically offer one reshipment at no additional shipping cost for areas listed on our Destination Summary.) \nWe plan to ship these packages worldwide from our fulfillment center in Germany (for best cost), so please take that into account when considering your import costs. Due to the reliability challenges for destinations not listed specifically in our destinations graphic above, if your package is lost in transit, we will only be able to provide you with a reshipment if you pay the shipping cost again.\n\nBy backing this campaign and asking us to ship your rewards to an address outside of the locations listed on our Destination Summary, you understand and agree that you are responsible for paying the cost for a reshipment in the event that your initial shipment is lost in transit. The reshipment cost for lost packages is the same cost as listed on the shipping table here. You also agree that you are responsible for paying any taxes, customs, and other local fees or charges associated with receiving your rewards. \nWe collect and remit taxes for each of these regions described below, as required by local law and our scope of business. Some regions do require that taxes are remitted based on both the product cost and shipping cost, so keep that in mind as you plan for these costs. Taxes will be collected in the pledge manager after the campaign along with shipping. Remember, we are a US company registered in these territories, so rates may be different than you\u2019re used to seeing for local companies! Please see below for more information about the tax rates to be collected for each destination. The pledge manager will calculate and collect the appropriate tax based on the many requirements in place at the time the pledge manager runs. For all destinations outside of these specifically listed below, you may be required to remit local taxes yourself.\nClick here to see local tax rates in the U.S.\nWe collect and remit sales tax in all US states where we\u2019re required to by our scope of business and local laws.

Three different crops\u2014in this case, pumpkins, corn, and beans\u2014are planted close together. Corn provides a lattice for beans to climb. The beans bring in nitrogen from the air into the soil, and the pumpkins provide a natural mulch ground cover helping to reduce weeds and keep pests away. \nAll the crops, fruits, flowers, and hives are represented by mini-tracks. The areas are interconnected to other elements in the game, giving you bonuses along the way. Many crops generate goods that are used to unlock bonus actions. Advancing on all of these tracks offers various amounts of points, advancements, and bonuses.\nThree Sisters is the brand new loaded roll-and-write game from the designers of Fleet: The Dice Game, Wasteland Express Delivery Service, Piepmatz, Stellar, and more. Three Sisters packs all the decisions and fun of a full gaming experience into an efficient and innovative package. \n The Tractor Meeple is an alternative meeple to Farmer Edith for those extra busy days in the yard!\nPreview Video from Tantrum House \nThree Sisters is played over 8 rounds. Each round, dice are rolled based on the number of players, grouped by number, and each group is placed on a section of the action rondel. Then players take turns drafting one die and using it. When everyone is done, everyone gets another action based on the die that is remaining.\nThe die you take lets you do two things: Work your farm based on the value of the die and then take the action of the section you took it from.  When you work on your farm, you are focused on the zone matching the die value. You may either Plant or Water. The actions on the rondel let you interact with other areas of your yard like your shed, fruit,  or apiary. \nThe player sheets have several areas: Your field, divided into six zones, each containing the three crop types, and various other areas related to additional actions you can take: Fruits, perennial flowers, your apiary, and a shed with tools that have special abilities.\nHow to Play Video from All You Can Board \n Three Sisters has a fully developed solo mode sure to satisfy solo gamers of all types.

This means that while the first round of the game will play normally, every subsequent round will have a weather effect that will provide emergent tactical decisions and opportunities for you as you farm.\nThe weather expansion board sites above the game board and the cloud meeple is used to mark the weather condition that is in play for the round.\n We appreciate SO MUCH that you have considered supporting Three Sisters on  Kickstarter. Shipping is expensive and difficult. Motor City Gameworks understands that you have many choices on how to spend your hard-earned gaming dollar. \nWe would like to help with some of the cost of shipping to make it as bearable as possible. Please see the shipping estimates below. \n All estimates include a significant discount! \nWhile the shipping could change, we have worked very hard to provide the best possible value by setting up partnerships all over the world.  This allows us to provide customs-friendly shipping to the USA, Canada, the EU, Australia, and parts of Asia. If you reside anywhere not listed, please contact us through Kickstarter and we can provide a shipping estimate.  Shipping will be charged post-campaign in the pledge manager. You will be able to confirm your reward, updated total with shipping, and your address.\n *Rest of Asia includes Japan, Korea, South, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, Vietnam, Hong Kong, Macao\n\nAdditional Copies\nAdditional copies will be available in the pledge manager after the campaign for $29/ea. Those extra copies will include all Kickstarter exclusive content.\n\nShipping Estimates for Additional Copies\nThe current shipping estimates are based on one copy, weighing near 1.5lbs. The shipping with additional copies will be calculated based on weight and the shipping discount will come off the top of the total.  The estimates below are for planning purposes,  it may come in less or more.\n\nIn most non-US regions, each additional copy would be $5 additional shipping, up to 3 three add-on copies (4 total copies on an order).\n\nFor US backers,  each additional copy would be $2 additional shipping, up to 9 add-on copies (10 total copies on an order).\n\nAgain, do not add these to your order on Kickstarter, back for one copy and additional copies can be added during the pledge manager.

Before the plane crashes, players must agree by majority vote to Hit the Silk!\nThe plane height is tracked by the Altimeter, which also indicates when you will cast a vote - is it time to Hit the Silk!?

From these, they must choose to keep 4 and openly discard the other 2. \nHere are the cards you might find:\nASSETS\nBriefcases - stashed with loot (at values of \u00a310k, \u00a320k, \u00a330k, \u00a340k)\nParachutes - to save your life\nKnives - to defend against theft\nSelection of Cards from the Game\nACTIONS (when played, these cause the plane to lose altitude)\nSpy - looks at another players' hand\nHandcuffs - attach yourself to another player to prevent them jumping without you\nKey - unlock handcuffs OR open the lockbox\nSteal - speculatively steal from another player \nKung Fu - defend an attempt to rob you\nRevolver - threaten a player with your gun to demand items\nBullet - combine with a revolver to take matters into your own hands and gain loot\nPoison - poison another player to accelerate negotiations\nAntidote - save a player from death by poison\nSUNDRY\nPilot's Licence - gives you an advantage if you're the last man standing and need to land the plane - see section below!\nFlannels - just a pile of laundry, unless you're swindling someone in a trade\nOn your turn card - reference card for game play\nON YOUR TURN\nThe starting player (selected at random) begins her turn by taking as many of the following actions as she wishes:\nPlay Reference Card\nChange Cards (once only per turn) - trade out unwanted items from your hand for new ones. Players will see what you discard. As the plane descends, you'll get more choice in the card draw. \nPerform actions - use as many action cards from your hand as you want. Remember each action causes the plane to drop lower!\nOffer trades - make deals with other players and exchange cards face down. No one said you had to be truthful in the trade right?\n...or do nothing. There's a cost to doing nothing though - the plane drops another 500ft before the next player begins their turn, with one eye on their hand and the other on the Altimeter. \nHIT THE SILK!\nWhen the opportunity arises to jump out of the plane (as indicated on the Altimeter), the players vote to wait or Hit the Silk! If there's no majority decision to Hit the Silk! then players return to the plane and continue negotiating and seeking out the items and loot they need. \nIf there's a majority vote to Hit the Silk! everyone jumps out of the plane. Then players reveal all of their cards and find out whether the team has sufficient cash to pay off the casino (and hopefully some surplus!).\nAnyone handcuffed to someone wearing a parachute gets dragged off the plane and the fates of the two are entwined. Two parachutes will save them, one will not.\nSTRATEGY\nBe careful what you reveal! In collaborating with others, you will need to convince them you have a parachute and sufficient cash. Here's the catch - in doing so, you make yourself vulnerable to theft or attack from the desperate. \nYou have a number of tactics at your disposal: trades (you can cross someone or trade honestly), bluff about your hand, defend your assets with a weapon, or go after a parachute by theft or force. Be warned - alliances can be fragile and you definitely can't rest on your laurels. Fortunes can change in the turn of a hand. \nWAYS TO WIN\nYou land safely as part of a group with enough cash to pay off the casino\nIf left on the plane without a parachute, you skilfully land the falling plane (see below)\nWAYS TO LOSE\nYou land safely, but without enough cash between you. Without the casino's money, you're as good as dead\nYou're killed (shot, poisoned or handcuffed to someone without enough parachutes between you)\nYou're left on the plane without a parachute and it crashed into a lake, mountain or runway\nLAND THE PLANE!\nWithout a 'chute, left high and dry, any stragglers get a last ditch attempt to land the plane. Flying isn't exactly your forte, so don't expect good odds. Maybe lady luck will be on your side though. \nThe Card Organiser is flipped to play the Finale Ending\nPlayers flip the board over and navigate the mini game with two dice that determine the direction and distance of plane movement. Luck interweaves strategy as your decisions and dice rolls guide the plane closer to the ground. It's a frantic attempt to dodge the lake, land and screech to a halt before the aircraft hits the mountainside. \nRULEBOOK\nAbove, we've tried to introduce the game in a story telling way, but if you're looking for a deeper understanding of the rules,  here's our draft gameplay guide.\nYou can also get an idea of how to play from this video put together by Lance of Love2Hate Board Games:\nNORTHERN DICE\n\"It\u2019s nail biting stuff, and it\u2019s that captivating theme and engagement that we loved.\" Read Northern Dice's excellent preview: A 5000ft Leap Of Faith\n\nBOARD GAME REVIEW\n\"There is a lot of mayhem, amusement and take that packed into the deck of cards.

Don\u2019t miss out!\" \nWatch below: Jim.Gamer of What Board Game conducted an interview with Brendan Mills, designer of Hit the Silk!\nOur prototype went out to a number of other previewers and we've collected some of the great feedback for the game here: \nHere are the pledges offered in our Kickstarter. \nIf you are a retailer and interested in further details, please visit the FAQ section or email orders@escapeplanboardgames.com\nAs if the base game wasn't thrilling enough, we're hoping to unlock some additional, exciting stretch goals during the campaign.\nThere's a mix of component upgrades and brilliant, new game features.

At the end of the campaign, we'll wait a few weeks for pledges to be sent through to us by Kickstarter and begin using that time to finalise the artwork - and make any adjust if we reach stretch goals that require us to modify anything. \nIn the mean time, we will open up a system to allow backers to pay for shipping and manage their pledge. We'll then provide a cut off date for getting that detail to us and lokck in the final numbers of production and finalise the specifications. \nFrom there, we'll send the files over to LudoFact and they will pass through data control. We know from experience of working with them that they are reliable and communicative. We anticipate that production will finish in the Autumn and we will then move into fulfilment in the early Winter. \nAny questions, do drop us a note! \nShipping Costs will be collected after the campaign ends. We anticipate the following prices and will do our very best to keep to these estimates. \nPlease note these shipping costs reflect the postage for a single unit of Hit the Silk!\nIf you need a quote for multiple items, please send us a direct message and we will do our best to assist you with a more accurate idea of price. \nShipping Estimates\nGermany \u00a35\nUK, Belgium, Netherlands, Luxembourg \u00a36\nSwitzerland, Czech Republic, Denmark, Liechtenstein, Austria, Italy, Vatican City \u00a37\nFrance, Monaco \u00a39\nHungary, Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia \u00a310\nSpain, Ireland, Portugal, Sweden \u00a312\nRest of Europe \u00a315-20\nUSA/Canada \u00a315\nRest of the World \u00a320-25\nCustoms-friendly shipping will be offered to UK, EU, US & Canadian backers.\nHit the Silk! brings a lot of fun to the table.

In early 2020, it was re-imagined during lockdown as a semi-cooperative, social game.  We hope you will help us bring it to life. \n\nThanks for reading about our project! Do message or email us if you have any questions. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nSECOND KICKSTARTER PROJECT\n\nWe're still fairly new to the board game category, but we do have the experience of running a successful campaign the first time around, delivering 75% of orders ahead of schedule. We also many years experience in delivering successful games in a parallel industry: escape rooms. There's a lot of transferred knowledge we bring with us. Whilst we are reaching a new audience for board games, we do have an established following of gamers and marketing experience in the team to extend our reach.\n\nPRODUCTION VALUE\n\nOur default is to always aspire to the highest quality available; the challenge is that this needs balancing with affordability. We're asking for backing for a new project and are aiming for a price point that is attractive to supporters without compromising on component quality. We're working with industry experts to find this balance.\n\nMANUFACTURING & SHIPPING DURING COVID-19\n\nAs with any large volume order, there is an inherent risk of delay to project delivery. Experience shows us to manage this risk best, we need to work with reputable suppliers who have a track record of delivery high quality projects to an agreed timescale. The COVID-19 pandemic presents many unknowns and may delay the production a little, but happily, we are sourcing from European suppliers so we are unlikely to see significant delays. We have had their assurances that the impact is minimal at this time.\n\nWe have developed the product as far as possible (manufactured prototypes; fully tested game play; artwork design signed off; marketing plan devised) prior to manufacture. Therefore, we do not foresee any delays from our end. We're excited by the prospect of Kickstarter support bringing this game to market.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nReusability and recyclability\nWe are working with eco-conscious European suppliers that have a green promise. It is intended that we will make the product fully from recyclable materials to avoid any landfill increase.\nSustainable materials\nCardboard: the paper industry is very energy-intensive, however most of the required energy can be produced in-house via renewable energy sources such as wind and solar. We will seek out the cardboard with the highest possible percentage of recycled material saving resources and consuming the least energy. Where wooden pieces are used (minimal), sustainable forestry will supply. We aspire to avoid plastic.\nEnvironmentally friendly factories\nWe insist on working with a factory that has an eco-conscious policy that invest in renewable energy and use local/regional sources to avoid unnecessary long distance haulage.", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a31 or more", "title": "Strapped in!", "descp": "Access to all project updates and a chance to buy anything advertised in the campaign (although at a higher price after the campaign closes) or pick up any other products you may have missed from previous campaigns.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2021"}], "stat": ["35 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a322 or more", "title": "Hit the Silk!", "descp": "Hit the Silk! board game, available at \u00a322 (discounted from the retail price)\nPledge for the game now and shipping costs are collected after the campaign ends.

Beyond that, we'll be commissioning other freelancers to work with us. Beyond that... who knows? How exciting is that? \n\nRewards \nWe're keeping it simple. The rewards are where you can buy issues of the magazine. This Kickstarter will establish a product/market fit for the mag before we go to print and make more issues. We're inviting retailers and advertisers to be part of this from day one via this Kickstarter. \nThe Kickstarter platform doesn't let you choose more than one reward, so please email editor@freelancermagazine.co.uk if you are interested in more than one reward and I can sort it out for you. \n\nThe Team \nSophie Cross (it's me!) is the founder and editor of Freelancer Magazine.

And to filmmaker, Jesse Roth, for shooting and producing the Kickstarter video.

As the leader of a noble house seeking the favour of the Emperor you plan to aid in its reconstruction. Collect the materials you need to contribute to rebuilding the Palace monuments, and commemorate the restoration by creating a beautiful painting of his beloved gardens.\nWill your efforts catch the eye of the Emperor, or will your rival nobles be honoured instead? Only one house will win the Emperor\u2019s ultimate recognition.\nEternal Palace is a highly interactive dice-placement Euro game for 1-5 players. Players assign workers, represented by dice, to locations based on their combined value. You'll visit locations to gain resources, rebuild monuments, and gather painting pieces for your masterpiece. \nDice placement\nThe way dice are played in Eternal Palace is unlike any other game. You'll roll dice and secretly group them behind a screen. Your opponents will know what dice you have but not how you'll use them. Will you use the 3/4/5 to visit locations 3, 4, and 5 or will you group them to visit location 12? Or maybe something in between? Predicting your opponents moves and making a surprise move yourself really elevates Eternal Palace to a game that is truly great! Once the dice are locked in, you can either stick to your decision or use some wisdom to manipulate your dice and go somewhere completely different!\nInteractive and positive gameplay\nUnlike other worker/dice placement games that focus on blocking opponents, the interaction in Eternal Palace is focused around mini races at each location. Get to the top of a location's track first and you'll get a bonus point. The race at each location means you'll always be interested in what your opponents are doing. Should you try to catch up or will you focus your efforts elsewhere?\nGreat table presence\nGaining points has never been so beautiful. Each painting layer you gather in Eternal Palace is layered onto your canvas to create a unique painting, which scores you points at the end of the game. If you win one of the race tracks, you'll gain a unique feature piece and a bonus point.\nHand- cut prototype of the painting pieces in action - the cut will be much more accurate in the production version!\nGather painting pieces throughout the game to paint your masterpiece\n\n*All photographs on this Kickstarter page are photos of the prototype, not a pre-production copy of the games, so dimensions, components and colours are subject to minor changes.\n\n- Rahdo\nThe rulebook will be translated into these languages and will be available as a free download from Board Game Geek by the time the game is fulfilled\n\n\nWe're currently working on a storage solution option for the painting pieces and we're hoping to update everyone on the progress of this by the end of the campaign. \nThe Deluxe Edition is limited edition which is unlikely to ever come into retail stores or mass distribution. If it does, it will be at least 3 months after the base game.\nThe miniatures from the deluxe edition come in grey, but they look great when painted!\nKickstarter pack - Fully unlocked\n\n\n\nFor this Kickstarter campaign we have chosen to focus our stretch goals on making the Kickstarter pack even better to reward our Kickstarter backers even more! They will be revealed below once the campaign is funded.\n\nAll stretch goals now unlocked\n\n\nWant to make Eternal Palace even better? In addition to stretch goals that are focusing on the Kickstarter pack, these social goals will improve the game quality for all versions of Eternal Palace.\nFollow the instructions below to unlock some great component quality upgrades \n\nThe image now has over 75 Thumbs so the box will now be upgraded with a spot UV! Click this image to go to the image on Board Game Geek and boost it even more if you haven't already!\nThis Instagram post now has over 300 likes so we've upgraded the rulebook with a linen finish. Click this image to go to the Instagram post.\nThis Facebook post has now been shared over 100 times so all cardboard tokens have been upgraded to 2mm thickness.\nWe now have over 150 retweets, so we've unlocked linen finish on all cards!\nWe now have 300 more Kickstarter followers so all card stock has been upgraded to 330 gsm\nThe deluxe edition will be exclusive to Kickstarter backers and direct orders for at least a 3 month period. It may never enter distribution!\n- Slickerdrips\nGather resources,  recruit advisors, rebuild monuments, and create your masterpiece to gain the favour of the Emperor.\nRoll your dice to see what values you have to play with this round. The player with the lowest total goes first. You'll be able to see each others dice rolls but you'll secretly group them behind a screen, so you won't always be able to predict what other players will do this round\nGroup your dice to visit higher value locations  or keep them separate to visit multiple locations. You'll even be able to manipulate your dice and change your strategy based on the other players' actions.\nVisit locations to gather resources. Visit with more workers to gain bonus resources. Resource gathering spots (and some other spots in the game) are also a race to the top: be the first up the track to gain a unique feature piece for your painting and an extra point for the end of the game\nPlacing a die here, the blue player gains 1 wood. The yellow player placed 2 dice here so gains 3 wood\nAdvisors give ongoing benefits or powerful one-time bonuses. You'll be able to recruit them at spots 1 & 2 in slightly different ways. At spot 1, draw 3 face down cards and choose from them, at spot 2, choose from the face up cards before your opponents hire them.\nPlacing a die here, the blue player recruits an Advisor\nContributing to rebuilding will gain you favour with the Emperor, and an art piece towards your masterpiece. You'll also claim the monument to take credit for your contribution but timing is important and these monuments will change hands throughout the game so only one person can ultimately take the credit. \nPlacing a die here, the blue player pays 1 wood and gains 1 favour. They also gain the painting piece and monument\nCreating your masterpiece is key to being honoured by the Emperor. The locations you visit will gain you a painting piece, which scores points and brings the game closer to an end. You might even get a unique feature piece to add to your painting if you're the first to 'complete' a location. \nFinishing your painting first and getting the longest 'run' of painting pieces will gain bonus points at the end of the game.\n2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 12 - a run of 7 painting pieces!\n- Rahdo\nThe solo mode is included in all versions of Eternal Palace\nIn the Solo Mode, you'll play against the Master, an AI opponent. The Solo mode plays similarly to a 2 player game but after you've grouped your dice the Master's dice groups are determined by the flip of a card. \nWhen it's the master's turn he will decide where to go, first checking if any of his dice values are the same as yours (in which case he'll try to beat you there) then checking which dice spots gain him a benefit (like going up a track or taking a monument)\nThe master is a worthy opponent, with 3 difficulty levels to suit all player skill levels. \nThe solo mode also has different sets of cards that can be used, which gives the master a different feel every time. This makes the solo mode very variable and offers a lot of replayability!\nThe solo mode is compatible with all expansions, except the turn order expansion\nThe solo mode is included in all versions of Eternal Palace.\nFull solo rules are in the print and play folder\n\nThe Turn order tokens (included in the base game) give advanced players a way to alter their turn order and perhaps gain an advantage at a pivotal moment in the game! They can be played after dice are grouped but before they are revealed.\nEach expansion adds a unique twist to Eternal Palace.\nLabyrinth\nRace through the labyrinth to gain bonuses. Will you take the longer path to gain additional favour from the Emperor or will you race to the centre?\nExports\nIn the Exports expansion complete export requests at the market by trading goods and you'll gain the benefit of the export. \nYou'll gain the bonus when he export is complete and you'll even be able to visit the fulfil the export request more than once to gain the benefit multiple times\nComposition\nIf you complete specific painting combinations first you'll gain a bonus. Some combination are harder to complete but you'll get better bonuses\n\nThe Labyrinth and Exports expansions are only included in the deluxe edition of Eternal Palace. The Composition expansion is included in the Kickstarter pack (free to all Kickstarter backers)\nThe Labyrinth, Exports, and Composition expansions are also compatible with the solo mode.\n- We're Not Wizards\n Help us make games - We're a small company and we rely on Kickstarter income to survive.

Prices listed below are indicative and may change slightly in the pledge manager.\nYou can pledge at the \u00a31 level now to gain access to the pledge manager.\nWe always offer excellent rates for retailers around the world. If you are a retailer, please send us a message with your store's email address and/or physical address and we will send you our rates!\nFor groups of 6 or more people, we are happy to provide group pledge discounts, as long as the games are sent to a single location. Prices will vary between location (due to shipping and customs) so please message us for rates.\nUnfortunately, we won't be able to offer group pledges for some countries in Asia, so please message us beforehand so we can check.\nWe are subsidising shipping and absorbing some of the cost of each shipment. Costs are shown in the approximate local currency. To double-check the pricing to your region or for more accurate pricing, please go to to the pledge tier and select your country.\nEU2: Italy, Sweden, Greece, Cyprus, Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Slovakia, Turkey, Romania.\nAll other EU countries are EU1\n\nActual shipping charges will be charged in the pledge manager and may be cheaper than the amount stated.\nDue to previous shipping issues, we do not ship to South America, Mexico, Russia, India and all of the Middle East (in particular UAE, or Saudi Arabia).\nAn optimistic prediction of the timeline:\n April: KS completes. We finish all remaining graphic design and development.\n June: Submit Files to manufacturer\n  July & August: Manufacturing\n September: Shipping from China to the UK begins\n October: Arrives in ports\n  November: Fulfilment commences\n  December Fulfilment completed. \n January: Most backers have their copies.\n  PLEASE NOTE: If there are any delays it could push this back farther for completing fulfilment. The above is an optimistic prediction. We always add extra time to our tiers' estimated delivery dates - as delays can happen. Therefore a realistic prediction is that people's games arrive in January/February - as we have indicated in the tiers themselves.\nCONVENTION SALES: We will be taking some copies to sell at conventions. However, by backing the KS, you are: guaranteeing yourself a copy, getting cheap delivery, and helping us continue making games. We will guarantee IF your copy cannot arrive before these conventions, but you or a friend are attending the convention, you/they can pick it up from that convention. Conventions we may be attending before fulfilment include UK Games Expo, Origins & Gen Con.\n\nAt Alley Cat Games we're a multicultural team so we're acutely aware of the importance of appropriate research when representing a culture that doesn't reflect our own heritage, even when the setting is fictional like in Eternal Palace. That's why we paid a cultural advisor and involved them in our research on Eternal Palace at an early stage. We made a lot of changes to the game and took on advice for things such as representation, thematic choices and even colour options. \nIt's also important to point out the one aspect of the game that we didn't change, the easels. These were not commonly used in China during the time period, but we felt that they added a table presence and beauty to the game that would not have been as striking had we meticulously represented painting styles in an accurate way.

Visit CaperEurope.com to join the heist.\nStay Connected with Keymaster by Joining our mailing list.\nFollow us on Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook.\nJoin the Caper: Europe Card Game Group on Facebook!\nIn Caper: Europe, turns follow a simple structure. On your turn, you will take pick a card from your hand and play it on your side of the board. Your opponent will do the same. Then swap hands. Follow this pattern until you only have one card left in hand, which you will discard. This happens over six rounds for two types of cards: Thieves and Gear.\nYou will also need to keep their eyes on the loot. Each location rewards points for the Mastermind (that's you!) who controls it at game end. Controlling locations require Capers. Each time you gain a Caper, move the location's Thiefle one space toward yourself on the Caper track. If the Thiefle is closer to you than your opponent at the end of the game, you win the location and gain it's benefits. \nAn experienced Mastermind (that'll be you one day) knows it takes a team to win. Each of the target locations has room for three Thieves and each thief has space for three pieces of Gear. Thieves and Gear work together to provide you points and give you control of locations. And despite common misconception, the Thieves of your crew are not selfish! Every gear card at a location counts toward all Thief abilities at that location. Strive to assemble crews whose abilities complement one another and assigns gear that provides bonuses to multiple thieves.\nCaper: Europe include everything you need to plan heists across four major European cities. Each city sets the stage for a unique heist experience each time you sit down at the table.\nWhat better way to celebrate our journey through the cities of Europe than with some postcards commemorating our favorite stops? For this campaign, you can participate in a series of challenges to unlock sets of vacation postcards from the Caper Universe. Each set you unlock will be added to your pledge for free! Reconnect with old game night rivals you\u2019ve been missing. Maybe pick out a couple favorites and use them as mini-prints in your hideout. And when it\u2019s safe to do so, challenge friends to a game of Caper: Europe.\nYou may be the type of Mastermind that wants to know every detail of the heist before it takes place. Which probably means you want to read the rules or take Caper for a spin on a virtual table. Our working draft of the Rules is available for you to peruse at the link below. Plus, check out the working draft of Old Bill while you're here!\nIf you own Tabletop Simulator (or want to purchase it) you can give Caper: Europe a try today!

Mattox in particular was enamored with bringing it to the US and so we obtained the US and Canadian rights with the understanding that Keymaster would rebrand the game and work with Josh Emrich to build out the world of the game through new illustrations. We released Caper in the fall of 2018, but by the time we needed to reprint the game in mid 2019, we didn't have capital to do so (we'd spent all our money printing PARKS).\nSo, we took the opportunity to dive into development with designer Unai Rubio (something we didn't have the opportunity to do when we originally localized the game). You can read about Unai's journey on BGG. We started by addressing community feedback around usability and learning the game, added some diversity to the cast of characters, then focused on redesigning the game around the best parts of the original.\nWe are so glad to be able to bring you this iteration of Unai's vision and are especially excited to have the worldwide rights to selling and distributing the game. Caper: Europe is truly a passion project and we hope the redesign feels that way to you.\nAll add-ons will be available in the pledge manager. You can purchase them after the campaign.\nThe full Keymaster Catalog (including our other decks of playing cards) can be purchased in the pledge manager to be shipped with you pledge.\nIf you are in the US or Canada and don't want to wait for the pledge, you can order all our games and merch available on our website - KeymasterGames.com.\nFlat Rate Shipping: You will only be charged the applicable rate above no matter how much you order. So, find (or make) some friends that want to split the cost of shipping with you! Once the campaign is completed, you will be given the opportunity to add additional copies to your order without increasing the cost of shipping.\nInternational VAT: We will be collecting VAT in the pledge manager and remitting it on your behalf. Your pledge will ship DDP (Delivery Duties Prepaid) to the US, Canada, EU, UK, Australia, and New Zealand. Those VAT rates are as follows: Canada 5%, Australia 10%, New Zealand 10%, United Kingdom 20%, EU 20% (we ship from France and pay at the French rate).\nUS Sales Tax: US residents, we will be collecting sales tax in the pledge manager for the following states: California, Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, Washington\n\nAlternate Shipping Options: Paying for shipping is a drag. We get it! If the shipping prices above give you pause, there are several other paths to getting your hands on the Mastermind Edition.\n1) Join the Caper Facebook group or BGG Forums and organize a group pledge!\n2) Reach out to a FRIENDLY LOCAL game store in your area to ask if they are joining the retailer pre-order. (See retailer information below.)\nKeymaster is here to inspire you to explore life together. We think board games are a perfect avenue to create that joy and deep connection with each other, especially when they are beautiful and immersive experiences. Caper is particular is a chance to explore our quirky sides and share an engaging head to head game that should remind you of your favorite heist movie and quirky comedy all at once. We hope you love it!\nKeymaster Games is a very small company. Until last year, we only had 1 full time employee. And with the success of PARKS, almost all of our capital is devoted to trying to catch up with it's demand. Without your help, we wouldn't be able to bring Caper back to market this year. Additionally, Kickstarter is an incredible way to engage with you and share our passion for this game!

Until you confirm you pledge, we have no way of identifying which rewards you desire to receive or where you wish to receive them. If you do not confirm your rewards in the Pledge Manager within 6 weeks of the conclusion of the campaign, you agree that Keymaster will have fulfilled its obligations to you in full for payment received. We may, at our discretion, offer a refund or choose to ship your rewards if you contact us and confirm your pledge after the 6 week window has elapsed.\nWe work with world class shipping partners, but they are only as good as the information they are provided. It is your responsibility to monitor the project's status and update your address as needed prior to fulfillment. The best way to monitor the project's status is to read our Kickstarter Updates. Should you provide an incorrect or out of date address, you will be responsible for costs incurred if a reshipment or reroute is need.\nThat said, even with world class partners and correct addresses, shipments are sometimes damaged or lost. If any part of your order, other than a game box, is damaged upon opening, we will provide free replacement parts for as long as we have them available.\nIf ever a shipment is not marked as delivered, we will cover the cost of reshipment. Additionally, we will cover the cost of 1 re-shipment for any lost or stolen package within 2 weeks of the package being marked as delivered and after our shipping partners conduct an investigation with the carrier.\nOur Goal is for you to be the first in the world to play our games. As such, we will not sell and deliver Caper: Europe at any convention or on our webstore until we have delivered games to a majority of our Backers.

You can go to our Discord channel to find scheduled events and ask questions!\nFor this campaign we will be releasing new Myth cards and other surprises on a regular basis and may also have funding goal stretch goals as well.\nCost:  Shipping is really expensive (almost as much as making the actual game) and we have tried to come up with pricing that accurately reflects our cost to get the game into your hands without creating a logistical nightmare on our side.  Your shipping will be added in the pledge manager.  We expect that we'll have to come out of pocket a bit based on what we are charging and we are ok with that.\nTracking: We will also be using non-trackable shipments in some cases in order to save on cost as tracking can add 30-50% or more in some cases. So please understand if we do not have tracking with your package we did so knowingly. Rest assured, that we will get you your game and any risk associated with a package not being trackable is on us.\nDelivery time: While we would love to get everyone their games at the same time, it is just not possible. There is a high likelihood that some areas of the world will get their games before others. Our commitment is to get the games ready and printed as fast as possible (we've already done a ton of the prep work).\nAt the factory we will break out the shipments to each fulfillment company with instructions to them that they should begin shipping as soon as possible upon receipt. In addition, because we have complete control over the U.S. shipments, you will not be able to order and receive the game on Amazon (or from any other US retailer) before our backers have it.\nPlease note: Because of unexpected delays and other unforseen issues, we reserve the right to sell the game at major conventions, even if they have not been delivered yet.  The reason for this is that conventions are among the best form of marketing and therefore necessary to give the game the best chance for success.\nOne guarantee we will give is that if we do release the KS exclusive version anywhere before the backers receive theirs it will be at a price that is higher (usually significantly) than what was offered in the campaign.\n\nRussian version will be made and fulfilled by Lavka Games", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs a publisher that has brought more than 20 games to market thus far, we feel confident in our ability to get this done.

Around every corner goblins and ferocious minions seek to block the Heroes\u2019 path.  Where there isn\u2019t an enemy, traps are set, ready to spring on even the most prepared Hero.\nTiny Epic Dungeons features a modular dungeon that is unique with each play.\nThe game is played over 2 ACTS: the Dungeon and the Dungeon Boss. In both acts the players are constantly struggling against the waning firelight of their torch which decreases each turn. When the torch goes out, the Heroes are forever lost in the darkness.\nAfter clearing the dungeon of all its minions and finding the entrance to the lair, players must engage in an epic battle against the Boss. Each boss has unique abilities and a lair with a unique environment that gives various advantages and disadvantages depending on the skill used and where the Hero attacks from.\nThese Epic Monsters cannot be slain by mere swords, axes, arrows, and the occasional spell. Ritual Rooms around the dungeon must be used to lower their magical bond to the dungeon. The Dungeon boss must be lured to these rooms to lower their defenses and allow the Heroes to strike the final blow!\nVictory in Tiny Epic Dungeons is achieved by defeating the Dungeon Boss!\nIn order to do that, the Heroes will need to collect Legendary Loot, and Supreme Spells. \nHeroes of old crafted loot to honor the ways of their clans. Bear, Lion, Phoenix, and Panther. Heroes can discover pieces from these ancient sets that grow more powerful the more you collect. \nWill you be the greatest warrior the Bear clan has ever seen?

Except, they are not like normal goblins.  When you defeat a Mixy Goblin, something explodes! You'll draw a Potion Card to see what the effect is. Each Potion Card will describe a peril that occurs when you kill a Mixy Goblin and will also leave you with a handy potion for use later!\nAdditionally,  the mini expansion brings new Dungeon Bosses, Minions and Goblins to the game. Each presenting a unique challenge that will test even the best players! \n***Kickstarter-Limited Exclusivity - Deluxe content will not enter regular distribution.

It can be prone to many mistakes and delays, even for experienced publishers.\n\nWe are proud to say that we're prepared for the task at hand and have years of experience in successfully producing board games and fulfilling Kickstarter projects.\n\nHere are the steps we take to prepare and reduce the likelihood of mistakes and delays:\n\n1. We have done significant pre-production. This includes having all the illustrations for the game complete and the graphic art over 95% complete. The production quote is in hand and ready to be initiated.\n\n2. We are working with an experienced manufacturing partner. We are familiar with their production requirements, timelines, payment schedules, communication methods and Chinese freight arrangements and costs for when it comes time for shipping. We will provide tracking information for the boat when the games leave China.\n\n3. We are working with an experienced fulfillment partner. We are confident that they can handle any amount of work we send their way. They have fulfilled many projects and have proven to be communicative, punctual and respectful when dealing with our customers.\n\nAbove all, I am 100% dedicated to backer communication. I will be transparent with our process and involve our backers as much as possible. I will be present daily during the project to answer any questions and I read every comment. I will provide regular updates and supply photos of the progress.\n\nThank you for your trust in us!

City of Crowns and the Collector's Box will be coming to retail in various languages. There are no exclusive items in this Kickstarter campaign. If you'd prefer to wait for the items to become available in retail, we are 100% okay with that. Please just choose whichever option works best for you.\nIn Paladins of the West Kingdom: City of Crowns, noble allies have responded to the recent attacks against our borders. Only through careful negotiation and diplomacy will these dukes, barons, counts and margraves offer the aid we so desperately need. Will you be able to muster enough support to once again defend this great city, or will you crumble beneath the weight of indecision and apathy?\nKey Changes:\nBoard extensions for each player, providing a way to take the new Muster and Negotiate actions\nBoard extensions at either end of the Main Board, housing the new Muster and Negotiate cards, plus revealing more Townsfolk and Outsiders each round\nEach player has a new Diplomacy attribute to manage\nNew Townsfolk, Outsiders, Paladins, King's Orders and King's Favours\nUpdated rules for solo play, with an added difficulty level\nComponents\nThis deluxe Collector's Box is designed to fit Paladins, City of Crowns, and all additional content, such as promos and metal coins. And yes, it fits sleeved cards. See the photos below. All boards sit together over the wooden components and smaller cards, keeping everything in its place. The box is the same size as the Collector's Box for Raiders of the North Sea (295x295x69mm).\nThe Vassals Mini-Expansion\nIncluded inside every copy of the Collector's Box is a mini expansion, which adds new yellow workers to the game. These new Yellow Workers can be placed onto any Worker spot, regardless of its required colour. In addition to this, they also discount actions where they\u2019re placed by either 1 Silver or 1 Provision.\nFor those not interested in getting the Collector's Box, we should have a small amount of the Vassals Mini-Expansion available in our Promo Store later in the year. It is not available separately for this Kickstarter campaign.\n\n\nPreview from Meeple University\n Review from AllAboard Gamer\n2-Player Playthrough with designers, Sam and Shem\nSolo Playthrough with designer, Shem Phillips \n2-Player Playthrough from MvM\n 2-Player Playthroughs from The Brothers Murph\n2-Player online Playthrough from To Die For Games\n2-Player Playthrough from Meeple University\nTo add-on additional copies of of any product, first select the pledge level that best suits what you are wanting. All shipping fees will be added at this point. Then simply add the cost of any extra items to your pledge level. This will need to be done during the campaign, as there will not be a pledge manager. All pledges are in NZD. There are no additional shipping costs for add-on items.\nYou cannot have multiple languages as part of the same pledge.\nTwo weeks after the campaign ends, we will send out surveys where you will have the chance to confirm what add-ons you included in your pledge.\nEach copy of Architects will include the 2018 KS Promos (excluding the tax stand), provided in a separate bag.\nEach copy of Paladins will include the 2019 KS Promos inside the box (in a separate bag of French/Portuguese).\nEach copy of Tomesaga will include the 2020 KS Promos inside the box.\nGroups:  Over the past 7 years we have always looked to improve how we handle larger group pledges. We want to offer the best prices, while keeping everything running smoothly for fulfillment. Therefore, we have set a lower price for all add-on items, regardless of the total quantity. There are no extra shipping fees for add-ons. There will not be any further discounts beyond this.\n\nRetailers: We will not be taking orders for retailers in this campaign. We recommend going through normal distribution channels. If this is not possible for your store, feel free to contact us after the campaign has ended for a price list.\nAll shipping rates are automatically added as you select your Reward Level.\nGarphill Games will handle production and fulfillment of all English versions.\nPixie Games will handle production and fulfillment of all French versions. The French edition is only available in France, Belgium, Luxembourg and Switzerland.\nMosaico Jogos will handle production and fulfillment of all Portuguese versions. The Portuguese edition is only available in Brazil and Portugal. All Portuguese copies will be sent using a tax-friendly shipping option.\nOther Languages\nOther language versions will also be produced on a similar schedule, but are not available through this Kickstarter campaign. This includes German, Italian, Spanish, Polish, Hungarian, Czech, Dutch, Chinese, Thai, Japanese, and more. If you would prefer one of these languages, you will need to wait for the retail release in your country.\n\nNo Stretch Goals?\nFor this Kickstarter we have decided not to offer any stretch goals. Instead, all components will be upgraded from day one!

At the webcam on the edge of my screen? Or at the people/notes on the screen, which makes me look like I'm looking down to anyone in the meeting? But most importantly, when you look AWAY from the people in your meeting, you can't see the other 90% of human communication which comes from  the NON-verbal!\n\n Center Cam changes the angle of your webcam, from the periphery of the screen, to the middle of the screen where the action is. Center Cam allows you to look at the people you're talking to and have them FEEL like you're looking at them- BECAUSE YOU ARE! \n   Now you can read the notes on your screen without looking like you're reading the notes on your screen! Teleprompter presentation? No problem! Live-streaming, sales, tele-therapy, tele-health, tele-whatever... Center Cam is the tool. \n\n The purpose of this tool is to facilitate better connections- and connection is what life is all about. Center Cam- A Better Connection. \n   We've conducted R&D with a partner manufacturer, and have operational models already. The unit is already in use with all of our product testers. We have the full package of camera, clip, light ring ready to rock. \n Update 1/28/21- We have completed 3D modeling for a custom hook that is attached to the clip as shown below. This will be 3D printed within the week!

We modified existing tech that already works, which eliminates HUGE costs/time from the process. Because of its new application and design, it is currently patent pending. We've also partnered with a European distribution company, which will save our EU backers time and money when they get involved in this campaign. It also increases our market to almost 1Billion people. \nWhat you'll get with every standard Center Cam order.\n   Various people have asked us what \"the plan\" is. And the plan is extremely simple- Help as many people improve their video-conference experience with Center Cam as fast as we can scale. Ian has run multiple businesses before, and we have scaling and transition plans in place. \n   We're excited to partner with Kickstarter and our backers to get this product launched and to change video-conferencing as we know it. Our backers are going to get rewarded with an a discount of 24% off of our projected retail price. THANK YOU!!!! We have great public rewards- however, we have some secret rewards built in if we hit some major milestones: $15k, $25K, $50k, $100k, etc. Show love and we'll return it.  \n\n\n We want our backers to know we're building a business, not just a gadget.

IN 24 HOURS!\nSTRETCH GOALS ARE NOW LISTED BELOW!)\n\nOur second ever Kickstarter, to make a new, wonderful album for 2021!!\nHello dear friends, fans and family,\n\nTwo years ago we asked for your help to support us making a new album, \"Jonny & The Baptists Love You & Hate Bastards\". And you were brilliant. We raised \u00a35380; made an album we're immensely proud of, and we able to pay everyone who worked on it a fair wage. We were able to pay for the producer, the engineers, all the equipment we needed to hire and the production work; and then the costs of pressing the CDs and their cases to a very high-quality. Thank you for this: you guys rock.\n\nWell, we're ready to make another album and we're asking for your help again. As you may know, we have always avoided getting a recording deal that would almost certainly demand a higher-percentage of our frugal earnings and, worse, limit our freedom to write and perform whatever we want. And, in this climate of no gigs and almost no income for us two, there's no way we could afford to pay costs and fees upfront and wait to recoup from sales in the autumn. \n\nSo - if you can help in any way, we'd be honoured. If you think you'd like to buy our album anyway, then please do so upfront and in so doing you'll also be a part of making it happen. And if you're feeling OK for money why not get a souvenir too - a lyric sheet and photo from the album recording, all signed and framed. A personal hand-written thank you card to accompany your new CD? Or maybe have your name in the album liner notes forever - or even get your very own zoom preview in April or May (where we'll do the new show for you, and any three songs from our back catalogue as the encore).\n\nIf you can't afford to help we still love you very much, and we understand how hard it is right now (hence why we're doing this again!). \n\nWith all our love,\nJonny & Paddy \n(Jonny & the Baptists)\nx x x x x x x x x x x x \n\n UPDATE: Woah, Nelly! (I think a. still a phrase and b. I also think it means what I think it means)\nSTRETCH GOALS.\nAs of right now, we are on \u00a39814 which is truly wonderful. Thank you all so much, from the bottom of our hearts. It's overwhelmingly kind and we're smiley and will keep doing our best to make this all super rewarding and joyful for everyone involved (especially all of you lovely lot).\nWe've had a bit of time to run the numbers and work out some more official budgets for proper stretch goals, make a few more reward tiers and fine tune how all this is going to work in a beautiful way. Here we go!\n STRETCH GOAL ONE - \u00a35000 - HIT!\nInstruments, Equipment & Fees\nThis stretch goal has already been met, and has given us the ability to repair our instruments and get the gear together to record the album to higher standard (not to mention it'll help us be brilliantly equipped to also tour the show with these instruments). It also covers the Kickstarter commission fee which we MAY OR MAY NOT WHO IS TO SAY initially not taken into account. THIS IS NOW SORTED HOORAY AND THANK CHRIST!\n STRETCH GOAL TWO - \u00a36500 - NO PROBLEM MATE!\nPay Paddy (blonde one, tall, wonky charm)\nThis stretch goals ain't far off, and (this is going to initially sound really silly but bear with us) gives us the ability to PAY PADDY. In the costing of the album we decided not to include paying ourselves as we know money is tight for everyone and we just wanted to make something uplifting without putting too much pressure on whether or not our time and work was budgeted for. This still makes total sense to us, however getting paid would make a huge difference to our lives and help with things like rent, bills, food, and self-esteem. The next stretch goal after this is Pay Jonny, but we're obviously going to split whatever we get to down the middle as we do that with everything. It felt odd writing this slightly personal money bit but hey we would rather be honest with you.\nSTRETCH GOAL THREE - \u00a38000 - DONEZO!\nPay Jonny (big beard, stout, youthful curmudgeon)\nMuch like the last goal, this goal allows us to PAY JONNY. I said it before but just to say it again, we will split this between us but anything towards our day-to-day costs of trying to make a record whilst the world (and the rather large prices therein) continues to spin around us would make a huge difference to our fears, concerns and money deadlines during the actual making of the album. We might even get to tick the box marked 'actually paid work' this year - who knows!\n STRETCH GOAL FOUR - \u00a39000 - SORTED MATE.\nProfessional Mastering & an Extra Track on the Album\nThis one's obviously a bit of a pipe dream, but usually the two of us and Rob have stabbed our way through mastering with no real idea of what we're doing, and each time we always get to six months after release and say \"Hey wouldn't it have been cool if this was professionally mastered? Oh well\" and in a magical idealistic world this could actually be possible this time. It would sound killer, and make us feel like real big time music boys. As a big thank you we'd even use the remaining money to book in extra studio time to record an extra track for the album. Wouldn't that be rad?\nSTRETCH GOAL FIVE - \u00a310000 - WE CAN ACTUALLY DO IT.\nProfessional Music Video for the Lead Single & an Extra Track on the Album\nNow this would clearly be a wild amount of money to be donated, but we think it's possible so here goes. If we hit 'the big 10 Kay-bos' (correct?) then we could make an actual professional music video that has things like a budget, a director and a camera person who isn't a phone balanced precariously on a brimmed hat. We'd love to do something like this to release online and promote the album and the tour, and if you help us make it a reality we promise we'll put our all into making it excellent. We'll even try once again to throw ANOTHER extra track on the record as a double thank you.\nTHERE'S ALWAYS ROOM FOR MORE!\nI'm going to stop writing now as these are numbers I feel uncomfortable imagining being able to wield in my actual hands in the name of creating something, but we have big plans and big ideas and if there's ever a world in which I need to write new stretch goals then I'm ready for it.

Cora, my eight-year-old daughter, and I both agreed that we were fed up of doing the same old maths worksheets. We decided we wanted to do something more exciting with our time instead - like design our own board game!  \nCora and I spent many enjoyable days working side by side on our game. Cora was having so much fun she never noticed me sneaking school work like maths, creative writing, art and computing into the project (shhh, don't tell her). As CoraQuest developed we both felt so pleased with it that we wanted to share it with other people too.\nWhile it started as a homemade project, CoraQuest has had massive amounts of support from a whole legion of playtesters. Although its roots are still true to the game Cora and I made together on our kitchen table, our playtesters have helped us develop CoraQuest from its rough and ready origins to a smooth-running, polished, and above all very fun game.\nThere's enough content in the CoraQuest box to keep you going for a very very long time. However, Cora and I had so much fun with the creative process of making the game that we wanted to provide the same exciting experience to others too. \n\n\nThe rulebook for CoraQuest includes guidance and encouragement on how to create and draw your own heroes, characters and adventures - making the game fully customisable.  \nWhat's more, we've even made a fantastic free web-based app that you can use to create your own heroes and print them out on \"official\" cards and matching standees. Just draw and upload your picture, choose your hero's stats and special abilities, and then print them out - it's as easy as that!\nCoraQuest is designed to be as accessible to children as possible without diluting any of the fun for adults. Here are three of the key features of the game:\nYou explore the dungeon by drawing cards from the dungeon deck and placing each card out into the layout.  This means every game you play will have its own unique dungeon map - providing a different experience each time. \nWhenever you venture into the dungeon there is a chance you will encounter some of the fearsome creatures that lurk there. Orcs, goblins and gremlins emerge from the shadows whenever a card with their symbol is added to the dungeon.  \nWhimsical and family-friendly narrative emerges during the game via the \"quest cards\" that are spaced out within the dungeon deck.  When a quest card is placed in the dungeon you read a short passage from the quest book and carry out any special instructions it gives you.   \nThe quest cards' illustrations include multiple elements that are open to interpretation, allowing you to use them as inspiration to design your own adventures.\nCombat is exciting, fun, and simple for even young children to understand. It's resolved using custom red and white dice. Your hero card and your weapon tell you what colour dice you need to roll, then you inflict one damage to your target for each success you get.  \nIf you're in combat and you completely miss your target your hero flips over to their \"determined\" side. This means you will get even more dice to roll for your next attack. This helps take the sting out of rolling badly for younger children (and for adults too).\nThe countdown track adds another level of decision making and tactical thinking to the game.\n\nEach hero has a special ability that is activated by putting a token on the countdown track. At the end of each round the tokens will move down one space on the track. You're unable to use your special ability again until your token has moved off the bottom of the track and has come back to you, so you need to think very carefully about when is the best time to use it. \nThe countdown track also has a second use - to add the threat of a spider attack! \nThis mechanism has received some of the highest praise from our playtesters, as it creates tension and ensures the game moves along at an exciting pace.\nEach time you complete a round without having explored further into the dungeon, the \"threat token\" moves down one space on the countdown track. If it ever moves off the bottom of the track then a swarm of spiders appear in the dungeon and start attacking the heroes. The ever-present threat of being swarmed by spiders really moves the action along! \nSharing creativity and fun is at the very heart of CoraQuest, and that is why we not only encourage you to make your own content for the game, but we also encourage you to share it with others too! \n\nWe have a special section on our website where we host community-created adventures, heroes and enemies that people can download and use for free. We already have lots of things on there. For example, acclaimed board game designer Jerry Hawthorne (Mice and Mystics, Stuffed Fables) stumbled across the print and play version of CoraQuest and liked the idea so much that he sent us this awesome band of brave rodent adventurers that he designed and drew.\nJerry's characters will not be included in the CoraQuest box, but they can be downloaded to print and play from the CoraQuest website.\n\nJerry isn't the only one who has sent in their work for us to share on the website though! Look at these fantastic adventurers from six-year-old Enydd Chadwick.\nBe aware that these are the prototype versions of the game. They do not feature the finished artwork and there may also be some small changes made to the rules before final production.\nWhy should I back CoraQuest on Kickstarter?\nIf CoraQuest doesn't get funded on Kickstarter it won't ever be made. This is very much a passion project for all involved and we do not have the resources to make and distribute the game without your support.\nWill CoraQuest be available at retail?\nWe don't have any plans at this time to put CoraQuest into retail distribution, however if the opportunity arises we would consider it.  \nIf the Kickstarter doesn't reach its target will I still be charged?\nNo. You will only be charged if we reach our target.\nWhen will I get my game?\nWe are aiming to deliver the game in late November 2021. We will keep all the backers regularly updated on each stage of the process until everyone gets their games.\nHow long after the campaign ends will you be charging for postage? \nWe will be sending out an email via our pledge manager (Gamefound) around two to three months after the campaign has ended. This is so we can minimise the risk of us charging either too much or too little for postage, as the rates for this can fluctuate.\nWill I have to pay customs charges or tax on my game?\nWe will absorb the costs of customs charges and taxes (including VAT) for games delivered to the US, Canada, UK, Australia, New Zealand and the EU so you should not have to pay any additional fees in these areas. Other regions may have additional customs charges as per local regulations.\nHow thick are the Dungeon Cards?\nThe Dungeon Cards are made out of 310gsm card (the same material that high quality playing cards are made out of).  We have found in our playtesting that using cards as opposed to \u201ctiles\u201d makes very little difference to the game, and it also enables us to keep manufacturing and shipping costs as low as possible as they are both cheaper and less heavy - allowing us to pass those savings onto the backers.\nShipping for CoraQuest will be charged after the campaign has ended in order to minimise any fluctuations in the cost of this between the campaign close and the date of delivery.\nThese are the current estimated charges based on quotes provided to us by our shipping partners. However these may be subject to change due to unforeseen international events or changes in law between now (February 1st, 2021) and the time of shipping.\n*There are a number of countries that we are unfortunately unable to deliver to.

You want your wagons to travel as long a distance as possible, because you receive victory points for every section of a track tile they pass. But be careful! Because the common rail network is built by all players in turn, your fellow players could also try to let your metro line run into a destination station on as short a route is possible.\n\nAt the start of the, a frame is placed around the board to indicate where each player's metro line starts. In the center of the board is a central station, and metro lines can terminate here or at the end of the map. \n\nEach tile in Metro shows metro lines going in different directions. On their turn, a player will either place the tile they have in their hand, or they may draw a tile and must place this one. Tiles may not be rotated, and must be placed adjacent to a previously placed tile. \n\nAs soon as a Metro line has connected to an edge station or the central station, a scoring takes place. The owner of that line gains 1 victory point for every tile track it passes. If it passes multiple sections of the same track tile, it generates 1 victory point for each of those sections per track tile. If the line terminates in the central station, the points for that line is double\n\nThe game ends when the tracks of all players are completed which will be at the latest after the last tile is placed. The player with the most points is the winner.\n\nFor more information go to see the game page on Board Game Geek\n\n\nProduction and Delivery\nThe production of Metro - The City Edition and the Deluxe Big Box is planned for Q3  2021.

We guarantee that the product you receive will be complete and all internal components in perfect condition. We will do our best to ensure that your package arrives in good condition, but all decisions on box replacements will be made on a case by case basis.

Become a Good Citizen and defend the public order of your village \u2013 or destroy it with cruel lies and accusations!\nCovid Deniers offers an exciting political spin to award winning games like Werewolf or Mafia. Intense debates, dramatic tension and fun for you and your friends are guaranteed.\nCovid Deniers is designed and illustrated by Pasqual Schillberg (Akademie der Bildenden K\u00fcnste Stuttgart). Video by Kolja Haaf (Filmmaker and Journalist, S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung). Voice by Azeret Koua (Theater Dortmund).\nInfections are spiking out of control, your village is in chaos. The Good Citizens are all worried and follow the government's instructions. Only some Deniers don't believe in the pandemic at all. They keep their infection a secret and try to stay undercover.\nTo start playing Covid Deniers, every player draws a secret role card. The game begins at night. All players are asleep. Only the Deniers are free to open their eyes. Now it\u2018s time for conspiracy. Each night, they can put one Good Citizen into quarantine. One round at night is followed a daytime round.\nAt daytime, the Good Citizens try to find out who among them is a Covid Denier. Within an open group discussion, they decide on one player to be tested for his or her true identity. In the end, either the Good Citizens keep their majority in the group \u2014 or the Deniers take over.\nAdditional roles, such as the Superspreader or the Virologist, come with special abilities and turn Covid Deniers into a viral experience! Our full guide including all rules can be found here.\nThe final game will include additional characters. Beyond that, we have many ideas for even more roles (e.g. \"Q\", \"Hypochondriac\", \"The Donald\") and hope to realize them with your support. Please also feel free to share your own ideas about exciting characters - we might add them during the campaign! \nCovid Deniers is influenced by social deduction games like Werewolf or Mafia. However, it is much more than that:\nBeyond being an outrageously thrilling game, Covid Deniers seeks to be an immersive experience of contemporary politics at heart. You and your friends take part in what is actually happening out there: A fight about truth and trust that trickles down to individual groups of our society.\n   Box items such as the branded masks, wipes and the inch ruler add a unique atmosphere to the game. They also serve a real function throughout the game and contribute to the storytelling power of the players. For details, see our \u201cHow does it work\u201d section.\n  While the basic rules are easy to comprehend for beginners, the various special roles add complexity and depth to the game. Each of the special roles like the Superspreader, the Tester or the Virologist, represent different stakeholders of the pandemic's universe. In the end, we tried to create a well-balanced system of complexity and fun that unites the best aspects of different social deduction games we love.\nCovid Deniers is made for unique and very individual gameplay experiences. You can play it over and over again - tension and fun are guaranteed!\nWe will start the production of the game immediately after the campaign. We plan to ship the final product (box + playing cards) starting February/ March 2021. We don't seek to earn a single buck by shipping the cards and the box. Instead, we will offer the delivery as cheap as possible. We did some research and attached the probable costs. We are confident we can lower these numbers.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have a finished prototype and an agreement with our manufacturer for all details of the product.

The source of inspiration was my father, who was always writing calligraphy in a dimly lit corner to avoid disturbance to others.\nMy job nature requires frequent travelling. There is a need to draw and take product photoshoots on the go. With the advancement of battery technology, I aspired to improve the light and coupled it with more functions.\nDESIGN\nWe have upgraded the CARD Light with functional enhancements and design improvements. The specific features are as follows:\n1. Small & Bright\nWith the dimensions of  86 x 55.8 x 24.5 mm, it's the size of a credit card. The maximum brightness is 2300 lux (@ 23cm.) With 2 brightness for 3 colors, there is a total of 6 modes. 45 degree convergent light caters to personal use without bothering others.\n2.Max & Fast\nBuilt-in 5200mAh lithium polymer battery supports the light to run continuously over 10 hours*. Battery can be fully charged in 2 hours with TYPE-C port, and supports dual USB output port (share 15W PD.)\n3.Easy & Versatile\nBuilt-in Hall sensor switches the light on automatically when unfolding CARD Light. With a single button, you can easily switch the light modes. Flexible structure design allows you to adjust the angles for any purpose. Multifunctional clip is assembled with neodymium magnet and flippable nano-suction Pad. Sturdy base of CARD Light can be fixed anywhere you want.\nSwitch Operation\n Glue Dots Pad\nThe Glue Dots Pad is waterproof, it can be used indoor and outdoor. Consists of a durable acrylic adhesive with viscoelastic properties, make the adhesive tape suitable for most surfaces. Simple peel, and No wall damage. \nWash it with water and dry it to regain its stickiness when the Washable Adhesive Tape gets dirty. The removable double-sided tape is very easy to remove and will not damage your walls or surfaces.\nUsing the Glue Dots Pad \nFeature \nWith that, this is the retrofits of CARD Light that we strive to improve. I have carried DVT sample with me for over a year, and it has become an essential part of my life. If you travel alone and study over night just like me, I would like to share, the best partner, CARD Light with you.\n What Is KableCARD ?\nIn 2018, we successfully launched KableCARD with your support and love. It is as small, light, and multifunctional as a Swiss army knife. People love it! Therefore, we kept the original functions, and upgraded them. Now, KableCARD is not just the same but better.\nWhat Is New\n1. 7.5W Wireless Charging\nWe upgraded the wireless charger output from 5W to 7.5W. With a faster charging speed, more time is saved.\n2. Magnetic Locator\nNew design of magnetic locator for iphone 12 accurately aligns the phone on the charging spot. It supports all iphone 12 series(mini/Pro/Max.)\n3. Silicone Cable + Enhanced Adapter\nWe replaced the cable material with environmentally friendly silicone. It is more flexible and durable than previous version. Being resistant to deformation, you can flex the cable freely to adjust it for different purposes. The adapters are made from upgraded parts (Soldered PCB >>Insert PCB) to enhance the durability.\n4. More Color Options\nIn addition to black and white, we are also introducing new colors, Ruby and Sapphire. The translucent design conveys functionality clearly. Various options to meet your need! \n5. Green Package\nContinuing our practice of green packaging through multifuncional usage, we designed the packaging into a A8 size organizer. Besides storing the KableCARD, it can also be used as a memo book.\nWe appreciate your support for KableCARD. We hope these improvements will bring more convenience and efficiency to your life, and get through this tough year with you.\nREWARDS \n\nSCHEDULE", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nDue to the COVID 19, the delivery may not on schedule if shipping problem.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge S$ 2 or more", "title": "Big thanks and stay with CARD", "descp": "Will get update and news from CARD", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2021"}], "stat": ["9 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge S$ 39 or more", "title": "new KableCARD", "descp": "Get a new KableCARD ( 4 color options)", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["272 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge S$ 66 or more", "title": "CARD Light", "descp": "Get a new CARD Light( black or white 2 options)", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["127 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge S$ 99 or more", "title": "new KableCARD+ CARD Light", "descp": "Get a new KableCARD(4 color options) & CARD Light( black or white 2 options)", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jul 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["271 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge S$ 144 or more", "title": "EarlyBird of CA4 PRO + CARD Light", "descp": "Get a CARD adapter 4 PRO( 45W TYPE-C(PD)+3 USB A) & CARD Light ( black or white 2 options)", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jul 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["20 backers", "Limited (80 left of 100)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge S$ 150 or more", "title": "CA4 PRO + CARD Light", "descp": "Get a CARD adapter 4PRO ( 45W TYPE-C(PD)+3 USB A) & CARD Light ( black or white 2 options)", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jul 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["2 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge S$ 177 or more", "title": "FULL SET", "descp": "CARD Adapter 4 + new KableCARD +CARDlight", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["99 backers", "Limited (1 left of 100)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge S$ 33 or more", "title": "EarlyBird of new KableCARD", "descp": "Get a new KableCARD ( 4 color options)", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["Reward no longer available", "100 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge S$ 60 or more", "title": "EarlyBird of CARD Light", "descp": "Get a new CARD Light( black or white 2 options)", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["Reward no longer available", "100 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge S$ 93 or more", "title": "EarlyBird of new KableCARD+ CARD Light", "descp": "Get a new KableCARD(4 color options) & CARD Light( black or white 2 options)", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jul 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["Reward no longer available", "100 backers"]}], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #8", "update_userinfo": "We are still in the midst of shipping~ \ud83d\udea2", "update_content": "Hello our dear backers!\nWe are glad that some backers have received their parcel! :) Do leave us some reviews on the comment page :)\nSlow but steady shipment\nMeanwhile, for the others, we are still in the midst of shipping out the rest.

TVs aren\u2019t always convenient so we made a way to take console gaming with you wherever you are without the need of an internet connection.       \n\n\n\nAs lifelong console gamers, we know there may be some PC master race gamers who gawk at the idea of playing Mario on their powerful gaming computer.  But we say the more games we can play, on even more platforms, the better! \nSeamless console docking to your laptop. It's that simple!\nLaptops are Really Versatile Screens\nThe biggest benefit of course is to take advantage of the screen you\u2019re always carrying already.  Not one of those additional portable monitors but a laptop that we use daily for like\u2026 school, work, shopping and creative stuff. \nShadowCast completely hides in the shadows of the original Switch dock!\nLet's imagine a time before 2020... and you were waiting at an airport for a flight to board and you wanted to get a couple rounds of Smash Bros in with a friend\u2026 or two\u2026 or three. Tabletop mode is nice\u2026 but let\u2019s just say it\u2019s not the most ergonomic. With ShadowCast you can easily plug your Nintendo Switch to your laptop and play on a screen over 4x the size.\nNot quite as easy as adjusting the viewing angle of a laptop, is it?\nYou Could Always use Another TV\nThere's also many situations where there just isn\u2019t a HDMI display available - many of us are happy with our laptops and integrated desktop computers. I think back to the times when I lived in a dorm room or even living abroad for brief periods where having my laptop, a PS5, and a ShadowCast would\u2019ve been amazing. \nWorks with current-gen and next-gen with up to 4K input\nAnd then there\u2019s always competing for the living room television - whether it\u2019s someone in your household streaming a whole season of the latest Netflix series or just having another gamer in the household. Oh and it also makes having a second television for multiplayer that much more convenient to set up. \nPS5 on an iMac - when a TV just simply isn't available\nOur App Makes the Difference\nAccompanying the ShadowCast is our new Genki Arcade app. We literally have made it easier than reaching for the TV remote and hitting the \"input\" button. We've designed Genki Arcade from the ground up to minimize computing resources and prioritize latency for gaming performance. Just open the app, and it'll auto detect ShadowCast and you'll be playing immediately without any settings to fiddle with.\nTV vs. ShadowCast - HDMI splitter shows a 0-0.02s difference in Smash Bros.\nGenki Arcade (left) is 50ms faster than OBS (right) and uses less than 1/3 of the CPU\nWe've developed a native Mac OS app that's optimized for both Apple Silicon and Intel processors as well as a dedicated app for Windows. Additionally, we're in the process of making a web browser version that allows you to play on shared/public computers and other systems without installing any software (compatibility will vary, for example iPadOS currently doesn\u2019t detect external video devices but we\u2019re confident it will someday!).\nWindows or Mac, we got your Animal Crossing addiction covered\n The beauty of being able to connect your gaming console to your computer means you can actually record, edit, and stream your gameplay. While it may not be at the same level as a professional grade capture card that costs 5-10x more, it\u2019s more than capable for most gameplay capturing needs while being much more flexible and easy to use across multiple platforms. \nWe're making last year's best capture cards feel a bit outdated.\nRecord To Your Heart\u2019s Content\nSure you can use the built-in video recording feature on the Nintendo Switch but that\u2019s limited to 30 seconds - that mean you'll have to rush that epic boss fight or finish that speed-run extra fast.  It's is also a pain to export and you\u2019re limited by an already small internal storage and expensive memory cards. With ShadowCast you don't have to worry about recording length and can rewatch your whole session of Among Us, add your commentary, and refine your strategy.\nWith a 30 second limit everyone is sus!\nWe\u2019ve actually created what we believe is the most simple to use, not just for playing but also to record gameplay videos.  Here\u2019s a sample of a recording of us playing on various consoles with the ShadowCast: \nThese videos are screen recordings of gameplay played off an early build of our dedicated Genki Arcade app.\nPlays Nice with Others \nWe made the Genki Arcade app to be truly simple to use, but for those that need more complexity you\u2019ll be happy to know that ShadowCast is compatible with popular professional capture card applications such as Open Broadcaster Software (OBS), Streamlabs OBS, XSplit, and much more. This will allow you to capture video with detailed customizations and even overlay various webcam feeds, graphics, and animations.\nIt's pretty much compatible with everything you throw at it\n\nBegin Your Career as an Influencer\nUltimately the main reason for anyone to capture video is so that they can share it with the world. ShadowCast can easily upload your previously recorded or edited videos and even stream live to your favorite platform - whether your team Twitch, YouTube, or FaceBook, we got you covered.  \nTo maximize compatibility across as many platforms as possible, we\u2019ve disguised ShadowCast as a webcam so that it can do a few more party tricks. This means it can actually be selected as a webcam under many typical apps popular today thanks to all the remote working, including Zoom, Google Meet, Microsoft Teams, and FaceTime - and further even supports video players like QuickTime and VLC if you don\u2019t have our app installed.\nVideo Chat Your Gameplay\nThis allows you to not only share your gameplay live with anyone, but you can actually play with your friends and see them on split screen just as if you were playing in couch co-op mode in-person.\nYou can play any of your favorite games in split-screen even without being on a couch\nDon\u2019t Settle for a Weak Webcam\nAs an additional benefit, ShadowCast works with all HDMI output devices beyond gaming consoles, including better cameras.  This means you can upgrade your video conference by swapping out your poor built-in webcam for most digital cameras, including DSLRs, camcorders, and action cameras - as long as it supports HDMI out (some cameras require a HDMI-mini/micro converter).  No more grainy, low resolution videos with poor lighting. \nKickstarter compresses these images, but hopefully you get the idea!\nThe Perfect Stay-at-Home Camera Assistant\nIt\u2019s also quite useful for situations where you just need to see what you're photographing or recording on a bigger laptop screen - no need for expensive wireless monitors! \nA better view of your DSLR in real-time so you can skip the expensive screen monitor\nWe actually had the idea of ShadowCast back in 2019 and started to collaborate with  manufacturers of the top video streaming and capture card brands. The timing was a bit too early as the components needed were overly expensive and had originally intended to make a Super Dock. Since then, we've refined the idea, dived into software and made something that we're quite excited to share here.\nMight as well make it as small as possible right?\nHere's also a video showcasing the latency between a TV and ShadowCast. We setup a powered HDMI splitter to show the screens simultaneously with the same baseline:\nPLAY\n\nSetup ShadowCast in 3 simple steps!\nIf you need a more visual adventure we've prepared a short video showing the 3 simple steps in real-time to setup ShadowCast.\nPLAY\n\nThis is really, really small\nDimensions are 25 x 52 x 9mm or 0.98\" x 2.1\" x 0.35\"\nWeighs just 10 grams (latest prototype)\nHDMI 2.0 input brings in 4K video from the latest game consoles, including the Nintendo Switch, Playstation 4/5, and XBox Series S/X\nUSB-C output transfers to computer up to 1920x1080 @ 60fps\nGenki Arcade app requires macOS 10.12+ or Windows 7+\nIncludes USB-C 2.0 Cable 1.8m long cable\n\n\n Get more ShadowCasts if you wanted various colors or one for every console:\nGet a Covert Dock, a pocketable dock and GaN charger for the Switch and more:\nGet a Genki Audio, connects 2 Bluetooth headphones to your Switch (and other consoles) works docked, and has a port to charge your Switch:\nGet a Genki Audio Lite, a slimmer portable Bluetooth audio adapter that is optimized for the Switch and Switch Lite (does not fit PS5): \nGet a Force Field Lite, a dual magnetic enclosure grip case with vegan leather to protect your Switch Lite with compatibility for both Genki Audio and Audio Lite: \nIf you're in need of a flexible HDMI, premium USB-C 3.1 cable, or portable metal stand: \nGenki was a brand founded by three guys with a dream to challenge the gaming accessory industry to make more compelling hardware.

This time, we\u2019ve actually gotten a lot of the work done before launching the project which means greater financial risk for us but a lot less timeline uncertainty for our backers.

With each new game, we will add a new reward level allowing backers to get all of the games at these Kickstarter discounted prices.\n\nTHE FOLLOWING GAMES ARE AVAILABLE AS OF NOW:\nAhead In The Clouds by Daniel Newman\nAnthelion: Conclave of Power by Daniel Solis\nAntinomy by John Baluci\nArcane Bakery Clash by Robin Gibson\nHandsome by TC Petty III\nHierarchy by Hugo Kawamata\nLiberation by Jon Simantov\nRagemore by Bojan Prakljacic\nSeasons of Rice by Corry Damey\nSmoke & Mirrors by Chip Beauvais\nSupertall by Nat Levan\nWhy I Otter by Aaron Andrew Wilson\nEach of the games below has some video content, but this amazing video covers both Antinomy (24:05) and Liberation (26:40), so instead of repeating it we'll just show it here. Although, with the number of views on it, I can only imagine you've already seen it. :)\n\nLet's jump into the available games!\n\n\n/an-tin-uh-mee/ noun\n(A contradiction between two beliefs or conclusions that are in themselves reasonable; a paradox)\nAs a Sorcerer, you have long sought ancient relics, imbued with  magic. What unspeakable power can you unleash when you collect relics  from anywhere in the spacetime continuum?\nAntinomy is a head to head battle of wits as 2 competing sorcerers in search of powerful Paradox Crystals. Play a single card from your hand using the color or symbol to dive into the  past, or use the number to fly into the future. The card you land on gets swapped with the card you played allowing you to build up a winning hand. Wherever you go, clever card play and a set of 3-of-a-kind cause paradoxes forming crystals of your own. Or confront your opponent in a clash to wrest control of their crystals. Collecting 5 of these crystals will ensure your control over space and time. Do you have what it takes to wield the power of Antinomy?\nEXPANSION AVAILABLE: Solo Flare (solo play) - Add it during checkout for just $2 (normally $4).\n\n\nIt's been a long time coming. You and a particular co-worker at  the Arcane Bakery simply cannot work together anymore. In a moment of frustration, you challenge them to a duel: After close, no holds barred. The loser resigns... and cleans up the mess.\nArcane Bakery Clash is a resource management game, where your resource is time. Specifically, time to cook the magical treats that you will use against your co-worker. You can choose 2 actions per turn, and you will either put a recipe card in the oven, peek into an oven (in case you forgot what you started cooking), turn up the heat (and advance the track on the back of a recipe card), or take a recipe out of the oven (putting the card into play). With these actions you will bake new treats that are used to either reduce your opponent\u2019s health, heal yourself, or allow special actions. When a  player\u2019s health is reduced to zero, they lose the game, and their opponent wins!\nEXPANSIONS AVAILABLE: Mystery Ingredients (more cards) and Boss Bake-Off 1, 2 and 3 (solo play) - Add them during checkout for just $1 each (normally $3)\n\n\nFor  hundreds of generations, the tyrannical Intercosmic Dynasty has ruled  the galaxy with a titanium fist. Their power and reach is spreading, but  so is word of their misdeeds. A band of resistance fighters known as  the Liberation has begun striking at the Dynasty from a hidden base.  Will you help the Liberation gain enough support before their secret  base is discovered, or will the you wield the awesome power of the  Dynasty to hunt down these traitors and bring them to heel?\nUsing a tiny deck of only 18 cards, Liberation plays out a miniature rebellion of galactic scale on your tabletop. An  asymmetrical game of cat and mouse, the Dynasty player expands their web  of power, occupying and exploiting planet cards, while the Liberation  player strikes from the shadows, sabotaging the Dynasty\u2019s hand and  performing daring missions. The odds are long and the stakes are high.  Can you stall long enough to cycle through the deck 3 times, earning  enough support to topple the Dynasty, or will you scour the galactic  map, tightening the noose around the secret base of the Liberation to  attack and destroy them? The future of the galaxy is at stake!\nEXPANSIONS AVAILABLE: Warped World and Moon of Mystery (more locations and new abilities) - Add them during checkout for just $2 and $1 (normally $4 and $3)\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n$20,000 Stretch Goal - UNLOCKED! Ahead In The Clouds\nThe  citizens of the Empacta skies long for  the days where everyone, not  just the wealthy, can ditch their masks  and breathe the precious air  that they call their home.\nAs an industrialist, you will collect dust  particles from the air  and water vapor from the clouds to convert to  hydrogen and oxygen.\nBy collecting, converting and selling these  precious resources,  you can provide your family with the breathing  room that you need to  keep your business afloat and go home at night  knowing you made a  difference to the world with fresh air.\nIn Ahead in the Clouds,  each player can  take three actions each turn. Options are either  taking/converting  resources via connected buildings or Cloudbursting,  which is breaking up  the established network of buildings. Players can  also take free  actions during their turn to claim contracts to gain  victory points, or  connect their habitat to other buildings. Players  must also be ready for  the blimp from below, which comes every couple  of rounds to take  resources back down to the land dwellers.\nAfter 8 rounds, the player with the most contracts wins.\nEXPANSIONS AVAILABLE: Tents Trackers and Contracts (more variety) - Add it during checkout for just $1 (normally $3).\n$25,000 Stretch Goal - UNLOCKED! Supertall\nIn the heart of the city, steel beams race skyward. While other cities sprawl endlessly outwards, these city  planners are looking up -  up - UP! Real estate prices are skyrocketing, and it\u2019s time for a new class of skyscraper, the \u201cSupertall\u201d, to reshape the skyline.\nIn Supertall,  2-3 players are competing  developers, presenting their plans for new  skyscrapers. Featuring 18  Plan cards with various amenities, players  draw 1 card each turn and  must choose to add it to their skyscrapers,  pass it to their rivals, or  leverage it for special abilities. Once all  the plans have been built, players score points based on the mix of  Residential, Business,  Entertainment, and Green Space amenities in  their skyscrapers. However,  due to constant lobbying, City Hall will  heavily tax one of those types  making it worth 0 points, so be sure to  plan ahead. The player with the  most points using hard work and good  planning will rise to the top, in Supertall!\nEXPANSIONS AVAILABLE: Municipal Buildings (variety and 4th player) and Spires if Supertall (new scoring) - Add them during checkout for just $2 each (normally $4 each).\n$30,000 Stretch Goal - UNLOCKED! Seasons of Rice\nIn Seasons of Rice, Corry Damey\u2019s 18-card   tribute to his Cambodian  heritage, players are  farmers puzzling  together paddy cards to expand  their family\u2019s  \u201clandscape\u201d of rice  paddies and ensure the most  bountiful of harvests.\nPlayers will be drafting cards and placing them into their expanding   landscape area to close off paddies in order to score the most points  by  the end of the game.\nEXPANSIONS AVAILABLE: Jasmine & Ginger and The Water Festival (adds new setup and goals). Add them during checkout for just $2 (normally $4 ).\n$35,000 Stretch Goal - UNLOCKED! Smoke & Mirrors\nSmoke & Mirrors is a bluffing game for  2-5 players. As the  greatest magicians in the world, players  will  compete for the top spot by trying to go bigger and better than the  previous magician using a limited number of tricks. But the players need  to watch how much they share, because once their secrets are revealed, they are out!\nPlayers each get 3 trick cards, from 3 different decks. They must use these cards to create a magic act that has a trick value of one  number higher than the player to their left using any amount of their cards. If successful, the players continue, building more and more dangerous magic acts. The winner is the last player standing.\nEXPANSION AVAILABLE: Smoke and Mirrors: Deduction (adds a 4th suit and new elements). Add it during checkout for just $2 (normally $4).\n$40,000 Stretch Goal - UNLOCKED! Why I Otter\nThe river is filled with otters of all  shapes and sizes. Decide which otter should jump into the river at the  right time to maximize  your score. Having the winning otter gets you  more cards, but losing lets you pick the scoring conditions.\nWhy I otter.....\n $45,000 Stretch Goal - UNLOCKED! Hierarchy\nIn the Kingdom of Darkhill, order and  power mean everything. The royalty reign supreme, but alongside of  their control are the plotting  citizens, planning to get ahead using  any means possible.\nHierarchy is an abstract game of order and power where players each  take a random set of 7 cards and play them openly, until they cannot  play any more. Cards must be played atop a card of a lesser value, unless either the last card - or the currently played card change those rules. When the active player can no longer play a card, their  opponent has won the game and has taken the seat of power away from their opponent.\nEXPANSION AVAILABLE: Emissary (adds solo play). Add it during checkout for just $2 (normally $4).\n$50,000 Stretch Goal - UNLOCKED! Ragemore\nEvil had beset the village, and we were  their last hope. We could not ignore our duty, so we set out on one last  quest. We fell one by one, until I was the last survivor. Holding  steadfast, I swung my axe one last time. As I crashed to the ground, I  knew I had found, at last, peace.\nRagemore is an 18 card solo game where you will complete quests, while managing  your hand and resources as you delve though the dark, fighting demons,  all in a span of 10-15 minutes.\nEach card is two sided; a demon and a hero. In the beginning of the  game, the player will set up 2 piles of demon-sided quests and a party  of 3 hero-sided cards. Then an immediate threat is revealed from the draw deck as the current demon card that may or may not be dealt with.  If it is not killed, the demon card will go to one of the quests piles   and an event written on that card will take effect. If it is killed,  the  demon card is flipped to the hero side and becomes one of the  party. The player can also ignore the immediate demon threat and goes on  a quest to obtain the win condition, or parlay with some of the demons  to turn them into heroes but with the cost of the hero's morality: the  hero  is flipped to the demon side and joins the draw deck of demons.\n$55,000 Stretch Goal - UNLOCKED! Handsome\nYou are invited to an evening of wordplay.\nIn Handsome, you will create words using a common pool of letters and personal letter cards from your hand.\nHowever, to score points, you're not only trying to create the longest word, you're trying to create words using the most cards of a single suit. With three suits available to score, every round you will see multiple opportunities for each player to score. The game ends when a player reaches 9 points.\nEXPANSION AVAILABLE: The Brilliant Expansion (adds word types and a tiebreaker card). Add it during checkout for just $2 (normally $4).\n$60,000 Stretch Goal - UNLOCKED! Anthelion: Conclave of Power\nThe sun is setting on one of the most devastating battles the Pocket Universe has ever seen. After years of fighting, it is becoming clear that this war will not be won on the strength of military victories alone. The leaders of the Dynasty and the Liberation turn their attention to some of the most influential figures in the galaxy to strengthen their  cause.\nWho will be able to consolidate their power, gain new allies, and turn old foes to their side? Who can form a Conclave powerful enough to gain control of the Universe?\nAnthelion: Conclave of Power is a game for 2  players who choose two unique special character abilities on their turn to manipulate the locations of the characters in play. Players seek to pull characters from all factions, good, evil and neutral to their side  of  the table (their Conclave), or push unwanted characters to their   opponent. The player that can amass ten  points of influence by  getting enough characters to cross all the way to their side of the table will be declared the winner.\nAnthelion: Conclave of Power builds on the foundation of the two-player influence manipulation game Avignon: A Clash of Popes.\nEXPANSIONS AVAILABLE: The Androids and The Folk (both add a new faction and planet). Add it during checkout for just $2 (normally $4).\n\nStretch Goals\nWe normally don't do stretch goals, but it's the entire point of this campaign! Each stretch goal will unlock a new game, which backers will vote for in the comments. When a new game is unlocked it becomes part of the pool of games you can choose from at the end of the campaign. Keep an eye on the updates to vote for your favorites! Here are some potential stretch goal games (and even more that aren't shown here).\nWe will pick about 3 at a time and ask you to vote for your favorite through the updates here.

Feel free to ask in the comments about others experiences, as we rarely hear of fees on the recipient end. But with the changes in the UK, it's hard to tell what to expect. \nAdd-Ons\nWe usually offer a range of Add-Ons through our website, but these reprint campaigns can become very complex. Every single order is unique, and it makes fulfillment quite a beast. \nSo in order to keep things simple, we are offering two featured add-ons, Sprawlopolis and Tussie Mussie. We will add them into the mix of games at the end of the campaign and you would just choose them in your survey. Since both of those games are in stock now, you may prefer to order them at our website and receive them sooner. To do so visit http://www.buttonshygames.com and use coupon code 0121backer to receive 15% off of your entire order wther you get those games or not. :)\n\nBoard Game of the Month Club\nWe have an awesome following of repeat customers. As a result, we've built the Board Game of the Month Club. \nIt's a subscription service where you receive unreleased microgames,  promo cards, expansion content, and Kickstarter discounts ... every  month! Supporters also receive from $1 to $10 off EVERY WALLET GAME that we make. (Members back our Kickstarter projects at the $1 pledge level above and see the recent Patreon post for your specific discount.)\nOur 2020 $5 packages include an episode of Personal Space, a solo game that has multiplayer interactions. It's part roll and write, part campaign, part digital, part real life, part fantasy. There are stickers and everyone receives some unique cards and unique combinations of cards. It's been live for a few months now, and it's our most  ambitious project yet and it will emerge until Feb 2021.\nThen, we are starting up a new year long game in March. It's called The Final Lightyear.\nIn The Final Lightyear you'll play solo or cooperative with a friend, as the  captain of a so-called starship, in hopes of earning some rewards and a decent rep. Using tactical maneuvering and dice-based action selection, you'll work through the sector's small, medium and large enemies trying to gain rewards and ultimately live to see another day. Customizable episodes will challenge you with variable enemies and threats while  offering powerful new gear and talented crew to help you in your adventures.\nOur $10 packages include all of the above and something extra.

We've been able to minimize these errors in recent years, but they can happen from time to time. We've also upped our pre-press staff internally to make sure we can hit intended deadlines.\n\nWith COVID-19 some of our suppliers have been delayed, so we've been allowing additional time in our estimations and setting up backup suppliers as well. Our local staff is working while socially distancing, so we are allowing additional time for a smaller staff to assemble and ship games. \n\nOur two unfulfilled projects are moving along according to schedule. Our Agropolis Campaign is scheduled to be fulfilled in March and backers are up to date with the progress.

Only GHOST, a special government unit, can oppose the machine revolution, but it seems the whole city is conspiring against them.\nBecome a part of GHOST and fight for the survival of your kind... no matter which one it may be!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPLAY\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlways in the majority at the beginning of the game. They want to protect the network with blue firewall data chips and finish their mech \"Apex\". Sometimes they lose their advantage by other factions secretly recruiting humans.\n\nAlmost always present, just in small numbers. They want to contaminate the network with red virus data chips, as well as destroy all resources in the warehouse of the humans. At the same time, they want to build their secret weapon \"Deus\", which can carry the 'Human Punishment' virus directly into the network, if nobody should stop it. During the game, the Machines get information about who the Humans are and can even recruit 1 human if they are understaffed.\n\nIf the Legion is in the game, they start alone, but they have several ways to infect 1-2 players. Secretly, the Legion is working on lowering the city's security level as low as possible or raising the enemy threat level as high as possible. To accomplish this, they use their emerging followers called Crawlers, while also using some other sneaky tricks.\n\n\nSometimes 1 character is secretly Fallen. Through wrong tracing and misinformation, they try to send grey spam data chips to the junkyard or into the network. The Fallen character is always alone in his team, but their victory conditions overwrite those of all other factions and therefore make them unpredictable!\n\n\nOutlaws suddenly appear out of all corners of the city. Coordinated attacks are very untypical for them. Due to their massive presence they significantly reduce the city's most important assets and increase the danger on the streets. Who controls them from the shadows?\n\n\nEven though the government has always been breathing down our necks since GHOST SQUAD was founded, and would have loved to take the project to the moon, they are now very grateful that we exist. We worked hard to put together the perfect team, and it was anything but easy. Everyone on the team has exceptional talents, and they have mastered all the tasks we set them with bravura. Everything was demanded of them, both physically and mentally, so that they are ready for the worst-case scenario.\n\n\n\nThe Beginning is a complete and independent gaming experience. However, there is the option to combine it as a full-length campaign with Human Punishment - Social Deduction 2.0. The concept of combining two independent games from different genres is new. We call this a 'Connecting World System', or CWS for short. Through CWS, you will experience the beginning of the Human Punishment story with The Beginning. Throughout this journey, your decisions and actions will create specialized conditions and unlock unique outcomes, which then affect how the next game in the campaign is played: Human Punishment - Social Deduction 2.0. Here, you play the big final battle and write your own story, which thanks to all the variables, will be different every night!\nKeep in mind that your loyalty is also maintained from Game 1 to Game 2, so between the games you will not be able to avoid trash talk. A unique evening awaits you!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe welcome verified retailers to carry Human Punishment - The Beginning.\nFor more info on bulk pricing and shipping discounts, please contact us at sales@godot-boardgames.com", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nProduct design\nAesthetics are important to us, but usability is paramount.

Cooperating with Ortholite\u00ae, the world-renowned insole manufacturer, we designed a dual-layer insole - The top side that touches your feet is Merino wool and the bottom layer is full of air pockets that support your feet with a lightweight structure.\n2. Talent Jogger uses ultra-lightweight, rubberized EVA for its outsole compound. \nA unibody construction such as this, provides both excellent abrasion performance and running-shoe elasticity.\n3. Our original Hive-Impact\u2122 outsole construction is the core innovation occupying the rear 2/3rds of the outsoles. \nWith hexagon cavities, this design reduces even more weight from our insoles.\nWhen combined, these innovations greatly reduce the weight of the overall shoe while still providing comfortable, all-day support. A pair of Talent Joggers is on average, 15% lighter than a typical pair of wool sneakers.\nA pair of Talent Joggers is on average, 15% lighter than a typical pair of wool sneakers.\nAccording to our ergonomics research, the proprietary Hive-Impact\u2122 technology makes the rear 2/3rds of the outsole considerably more stable and structurally more rigid, while retaining the flexibility of the forefoot section.\nThe hexagon structure also supports your feet better than a traditional solid outsole when you walk, or even during jogging. \nIn general, with our cutting-edge technologies, Talent Jogger can keep strong support for at least 18 months.\nMerino wool is prized for footwear because it naturally wicks away moisture while remaining breathable. It continuously absorbs small amounts of liquid into its fibers, then wicking moisture away through small openings in the woven fabric.\n This results in a shoe that is never too hot, eliminating perspiration build up and leaving your feet dry and comfortable.\n\nThe unique open-cell structure of Ortholite\u00ae foam creates a moisture management system, helping to remove moisture and provide a cooler, drier, healthier environment. It also contains active anti-microbial agents to prevent fungi from growing inside your shoes.\nTalent Jogger are the ultimate in comfort for bare feet.\nMerino wool is easy to care for. Talent Joggers may be cleaned in your washing machine and air dried.  (Shoelaces and insoles are still recommended to wash by hand separately)\nSustainability is part of our mission.\n1. Merino wool can be fully recycled and is often reused as material for carpets.\n2.

The EyeQue VisionCheck 2 is the most convenient way to check your vision anytime, anywhere with real-time results. Use the personalized results to order new glasses online and track vision changes over time. This powerful smartphone attachment uses MIT-patented technology to measure your refractive error and provide EyeGlass Numbers - the lens power needed to correct nearsightedness, farsightedness, and astigmatism. The VisionCheck 2 comes with the PDCheck pupillary distance measurement tool so you can quickly and accurately capture your PD and order glasses with ease.\n*NEW! Now the VisionCheck 2 can test for reading vision, commonly know as near-vision ADD (NV ADD). This ADD number can be used for reading glasses, bifocals, or progressive lenses.\nVisionCheck 2 is the world\u2019s only do-it-yourself smartphone-powered refractive error test. Some claim to have online or app-based refraction tests, but they are merely prescription verification services based on visual acuity estimates. EyeQue users are actually performing a self-refraction test while proprietary algorithms process, personalize, and store results. Leveraging the power and ubiquity of smartphones, the mobility of VisionCheck 2 brings accurate vision correction to billions of people, many of whom lack access to traditional vision care.\nSound too good to be true? Here's how to use it:\n1. Download the iOS or Android app and sign up for an account.\n2. Slip the VisionCheck 2 device onto your smartphone and follow simple on-screen instructions to start a test.\n3. Look into the soft eyecup. Look for the red and green lines. Use the buttons on the device to move them and overlap into one solid yellow line. \n4. Once you are satisfied that the lines are fully overlapped, click on the \"enter\" button and gently rotate the thumb wheel to the next position. Overlap the lines again and repeat. The test consists of 8 measurements per eye.\n5. See your results- EyeQue EyeGlass Numbers\u00ae (EGNs). \nHere's an example of what your EyeQue EyeGlass Numbers\u00ae (EGNs) will look like:\nWe are delighted to show you a proof of concept prototype video of the VisionCheck 2:\nPLAY\n\nOnce you have your EyeGlass Numbers, the next step is to measure your pupillary distance using EyeQue\u2019s PDCheck.\nPDCheck\nVisionCheck 2 includes another product called PDCheck. An accurate measurement of pupillary distance (PD) is necessary to order eyeglasses. If the measured PD is wrong, you will find the glasses uncomfortable and it will make you feel dizzy, it can sometimes even lead to headaches. Our patented PDCheck technology uses the smartphone camera to take a \u201cselfie\u201d and extracts the PD to an accuracy of +/- 1 mm.\nHow do you use PDCheck?\n1. Download the iOS or Android app and sign up for an account then start a new test. Next, you should put on the PDCheck frames.\n2. Center your face inside the oval and take a picture. \n3. Adjust the markers to the center of your pupils and T marks (if needed) to get the most accurate PD. Receive your pupillary distance measurement instantly! \nOnce you have your EyeGlass Numbers and your pupillary distance, you can get Try-On Glasses or get new glasses online using your EGNs!\n\nOur Try-On Glasses are custom made in California. \nAt only $19 (shipping included), they are a low-cost, super-fast way to experience how well your EGNs and PD will work for you.\nSubscription\nEyeQue smartphone-vision tests require an annual membership subscription. Your active subscription provides unlimited vision testing, unlimited access to your vision data, and exclusive access to other EyeQue products and services. An All Access membership for our VisionCheck (1st generation) and Personal Vision Tracker devices is currently $4.99 per year.

As promised, you are grandfathered into membership for life with your existing account.\nFor our many existing EyeQue customers, including those who have the VisionCheck (1st generation) with an active recurring All Access membership of $4.99 a year, we\u2019ll have special options for you to extend your current membership rate for years to come. Stay tuned for more updates.\nYes, yes it does! Here's how the technology works, in a nutshell. \nThe VisionCheck 2 is based on an MIT patented technology licensed exclusively to EyeQue. This technology has been extensively tested in previous generations of our products and uses a variant of the inverse Shack-Hartmann optical method.\nThe original Shack-Hartmann method is used in an optical device called \"autorefractor\" and trusted by eye doctors around the world. The autorefractor, short for \"automated refractometer, is used to give a quick estimation of vision correction. You may recognize it by its iconic \"hot air balloon\" or \"barn house\" image. Many of the optical principles and components used in the autorefractor are also used in the creation of the VisionCheck 2.\nThe device projects two beams of light that comes from the smartphone display into your eyes and onto your retina. Using an interactive interface, the user overlaps the two lines to form what looks like one yellow line.\nBased on the amount of pixel movement made to fully overlap the two lines into one yellow line, EyeQue calculates the user's refractive error. Proprietary algorithms then process results once a full test is completed. After three or more consistent tests are taken, EyeGlass Numbers\u00ae are calculated and presented in the same format as a traditional prescription with the spherical, cylindrical, and axis powers needed to correct nearsightedness, farsightedness, and astigmatism.\nUsers have performed approximately 150,000 tests using this proprietary technology. Hundreds of testimonials and thousands of surveys from VisionCheck customers helped inform product updates to VisionCheck 2. We set out to create a refraction device that's easier to use, with more accurate results, and better optics.\nBased on the feedback of our members, \u202fwe came up with a brand new form factor, app design, and test screens \u2013 nearly every aspect of the user experience has been reimagined.\nWe're proud to announce that the VisionCheck 2 was named a CES\u00ae 2021 Innovation Awards Honoree in two categories\u2013\u202fHealth & Wellness, and Mobile Devices & Accessories\n\n A more interesting test taking experience with new backgrounds: A new background channel features a variety of customizable animated images that help you get more accurate results. \n Larger, brighter, easier-to-see lines: A better optical system allows the display lines to appear larger and crisper than the lines in the previous device, making them easier to see, therefore improving test efficiency and accuracy. \n Easier to attach clip system: A convenient clip that's compatible with most phone cases allows the VisionCheck 2 to easily attach to any phone without interfering with any buttons or Popsockets.\n Easy to rotate thumb wheel design: A new, purely mechanical, easy-to-rotate thumb wheel design allows you to proceed to the next test without having to take your eyes off the device, so you can maintain focus and complete the test faster. Plus, testing has been reduced from 9 meridians down to 8 meridians, making for a faster testing process.\n Upgraded eye cup design: A redesigned, ergonomic eye cup helps filter more light for an easier test taking experience. \n Tactile buttons: Redesigned test buttons on the VisionCheck 2 improve the ergonomics of the test taking experience. The new buttons also eliminate the need to connect your device to your phone via Bluetooth - this also eliminates the need for batteries, so you don't need to charge the VisionCheck 2.\n Brand new app: A reimagined app design maximizes usability. The new app includes educational elements and makes it easier to reach support.\nThe MIT-patented technology powering the VisionCheck 2 has been extensively tested with over 150,000 tests over the past 3 years and has been optimized to give excellent refraction values for ordering eyeglasses.\nMoreover, at-home vision test results can be more accurate than a single point-in-time refraction test. Since your vision fluctuates throughout the day, taking multiple tests at different times of the day gives a better average refraction than a one-time refraction test during an office visit. Especially if someone is having a bad day!\nReal VisionCheck and Try-On Glasses users share their stories. \nDan:\nPLAY\n\nMichael:\nPLAY\n\nEyeQue has a family of vision testing products that work together to equip you with everything you need to order eyeglasses.\nWe cannot explain the science without explaining the human eye first. Nearsightedness, farsightedness and astigmatism occur when the eye lens and eye distance are \u201cout of sync\". Normal distance vision is the result of the light entering the eye and focusing exactly on the retina, where the brain interprets sharp images. Common deviations from normal vision include nearsightedness, farsightedness, and astigmatism. Nearsightedness, or myopia, occurs when the lens focuses the light before your retina. Farsightedness, or hyperopia, occurs when the lens focuses the light past your retina, both causing the brain to interpret \"blurry\" images. Almost 50% of the human population has some degree of nearsightedness, farsightedness, or astigmatism. These conditions are also known as \"refractive errors\".\nThe EyeQue VisionCheck 2 is an optical device that achieves the effect of a variable corrective lens as it translates pixel spacing on the smartphone screen to corrective powers. To simulate the effect of converging or diverging rays into your eye that a correction lens would provide, you simply move the pixels on the screen closer or further, emulating the effect of a corrective lens. The goal is to overlap the red and green lines and create a single yellow line. Think of the VisionCheck 2 as a custom converter of pixel spacing to optical power. Using that conversion, VisionCheck can determine corrections from + 8 D to \u2013 10 D.\nVisionCheck 2 uses your smartphone's display to work. A pixel spacing on the order of .07 mm (70 microns) or better is needed \u2013 the diameter of a human hair. VisionCheck 2 works well for phones down to 326 Pixels Per Inch (PPI). Any PPI below 326 means that the resolution is too low for it to be optometrically accurate.\nThe iPhone 6S, for example, has an adjacent pixel spacing of 21 microns, and about 63 microns between same color pixels. With this small pixel spacing, VisionCheck 2 exceeds 0.25 Diopter resolution. As a reference, 0.25 Diopter accuracy is the level typically achieved by Optometrists.\nWhile it is easy to understand how EyeQue can measure the overall optical power for nearsightedness and farsightedness, VisionCheck 2 also gets an accurate measurement of astigmatism by sampling over different angles. To measure astigmatism, a complete set of power measurements is comprised of 8 measurements for your right eye and 8 measurements for your left eye. Measurements are made at increments of 45 degrees and with these measurements, the astigmatism is computed.\nYes, that\u2019s a lot of measurements, but the device is making measurements of tiny differences that reflect the shape of the eye lens and cornea. About 1 diopter of astigmatism, a typical value, implies that the non-spherical component of the eye is about 0.25 mm. 0.25mm is thinner than your average ball-point pen point.\nAll computations are carried out in the EyeQue cloud as it takes a substantial amount of computation that is dependent on many different parameters including the smartphone you are using. As you take more tests, the results are aggregated together through averaging and removing bad data points. Each test is scored based on the goodness of the computed fit to the measurements. An example of test results is shown below.\nAlong with your test results, we also provide you with a measure of the consistency. The plot on the right also shows how other users have performed as shown by the relative size of the blue dots; most but not all users fall into the \"good\" category. Our personalized vision report is a great way to stay in touch with your test results and vision changes.\nSeveral EyeQue products, including the first-generation VisionCheck, have undergone clinical studies regarding their accuracy. We are in the process of publishing our findings (spoiler: they work extremely well) and will share them with our backers as soon as we can.\nIt all started with two friends who shared a vision.\nToday, EyeQue has a team of dedicated scientists, engineers, marketers, designers, and support professionals helping advance vision care, one pair of eyes at a time. \nEyeQue\u2019s Medical Advisory Board provides guidance on the Company\u2019s services, products, and programs with a particular focus on identifying opportunities for EyeQue to serve and partner with the medical community.\nThe board provides insight into the current and evolving vision healthcare environment, helping EyeQue to pinpoint the specific needs of healthcare providers, serving patients from within and outside of the doctor\u2019s office, where EyeQue technologies could be used to serve those needs in a meaningful way. The board is comprised of distinguished Ophthalmologists and will expand to include additional representatives as EyeQue\u2019s business evolves.\nA Mission to Bring Affordable Eye Care to Everyone\nWe\u2019re putting accurate vision tests directly into the hands of people around the world. Our patented technology makes self-administered eye tests available to billions of people \u2013 many of whom may not have had the ability to test their eyes and correct their vision without access to low cost, convenient solutions.\nA Global Need to Raise Our EyeQue\nIt is estimated that more than sixty percent of the world\u2019s population are vision impaired. Hundreds of millions of people, adults and children, are challenged daily by the discomfort and struggle of normal tasks like reading, studying, working and caring for their family. In fact, the global economic cost of lost work productivity due to people with poor vision has been estimated at 700 billion dollars per year.\nRefractive error, which eyeglasses correct, is the number one cause of vision impairment in the world. Yet for many families in many countries, access to an optometrist is limited or even non-existent, and the costs associated with obtaining corrective eyeglasses are not affordable. Sometimes corrective eyeglasses are not even available. Our goal is to enable anyone, anywhere in the world to self-administer an accurate refractive measurement test. With our advancements in technology, the mobility of the testing platform, and the commitment to affordable vision solutions, EyeQue will empower people all over the world to easily access and inexpensively correct their vision and improve their daily lives.\nMyopia (or nearsightedness) is the most common cause of blurry distance vision. If uncorrected, myopia can increase the risk of developing more serious vision problems including cataracts, glaucoma, retinal detachment, and macular degeneration - all of which threaten sight. Yet this condition is easily corrected, and progression can be slowed with corrective glasses.\nA closer look at this myopia epidemic:\nUncorrected refractive error has been steadily climbing and is now the second most common cause for blindness (~20%), with the first being cataracts (~35%).\nWe\u2019re taking the growing myopia epidemic head-on by rapidly developing and distributing innovative at-home vision tests and devices.\nOur Road is Long and Unpaved\nWe introduced the first at-home smartphone-powered refractometer in October 2016. With our continuous customer feedback in mind (primed by our Kickstarter backers!), we're on schedule to deliver our third generation refractometer in a few months.\nEyeQue's Goals\nEmpowering people to test their vision as often as they like in the convenience of their home.\nArming the optometry, ophthalmology, and optician industries with technological advancements to improve patient care by enabling remote vision monitoring.\nBringing vision testing to areas of the world that lack standard eye care and allowing people to correct their vision with eyeglasses.\nEyeQue is also actively seeking non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to use our technology to expand their reach and enhance their services, particularly in areas lacking eye care professionals.\n This project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 1,100+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $460M raised between them.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere is minimal risk to this project.

Over the course of three ages, each composed of a variable number of rounds of play, you will choose one of six possible actions to take. \n Simultaneous Action Selection: All players choose their action and reveal at the same time; if any player is the only one to choose a specific action, they get a bonus! See if you can anticipate what other players are doing so you can gain an advantage that will allow you to take over the Kingdoms! \n Escalating Shark Attacks: All players can control the shark's actions so you want to make sure that the shark is close enough to take out your opponents but far enough away that your creatures are safe! As the game goes on, more sharks are added to the game and the waters become increasingly dangerous! \n Variable Scoring Conditions: Each age, there's a different way to gain points and the goals change at three times in the game. There are goals that are based on being on the board in specific spatial patterns, for specific types of terrain, and for having specific actions of your species upgraded, among other things! There are three goals per game and every game is very different based on which goals come up. \nCan you outthink your opponents to seize the Kingdom?\n And Add-on your custom water Animeeples!\nIn English: \n\nIn Spanish:\nKingdoms of the Deep Overview\nEach player controls one of the undersea factions and starts with control of one type of terrain. \nEach turn, players simultaneously select from 6 possible actions to play. \nPlayers reveal their actions at the same time. Anyone who was the only player to choose that action will get a bonus, which depends on the specific action. \n\nPlayable actions are:\nMove:  Move any of your own creatures, your opponent's creatures, or even the shark! If you choose to move a creature into Atlantis, you get a bonus point.\nDeploy:  Place a creature onto a tile that either has at least 1 of your creatures on them or is adjacent to a hex with your creatures on them. \n- Creatures are placed one at a time, so you can travel across the ocean kingdoms quickly with this action.\n\n Bolster: Place cubes onto tiles that are your terrain focus. This allows you to place a lot of creatures out quickly.\nUpgrade: You may upgrade one action (move, bolster, deploy, etc) on your player board. This will allow you to do more the next time you select that action AND can grant you extra bonuses as well. \nShark: Take control of the shark! Use shark actions to move the shark or have the shark eat up creatures! These can be  (yours or your opponent's)! \nReset: Take all your played cards back into your hand! Previously played cards cannot be reused until you reset! \n- Depending on how the player has upgraded their Reset action, they might also get to do a variety of things when they reset.\nEvery turn a reset is played,  the Age marker is moved on the game board. Once the age marker is moved three times, the age ends! \nAt the end of an age, players gain points if they control capital cities and from Goal cards. Goal cards can award points or actions, then the next age begins! \nAfter three ages, the game is over. \nScore the final round and reward bonus points to whoever has the most creatures in Atlantis.\n\nThe player with the most points is crowned Monarch of the Undersea Kingdoms! \nRulebook\nYou can check out the (not finalized) rulebook here https://www.dropbox.com/s/ox5om7oxr56567w/Kingdoms%20of%20the%20Deep%20Rulebook%202020-11-26.pdf?dl=0\nhttps://www.gameosity.com/2021/01/21/kingdoms-of-the-deep-kickstarter-preview/\nWatch the video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW-w1788w8U\nRead the Review http://www.purplephoenixgames.com/kingdoms-of-the-deep-preview/\nWatch the Video https://youtu.be/DtqjcTgCsvU?t=402\nWatch the review below!\nWatch the review below!\n\n\nReviews coming soon! \n Lost Kingdoms: Pangea in Pieces \n200 million years ago, dinosaurs roamed the massive supercontinent of Pangea. But the Earth slowly began to break apart. As the lands shifted, these great beasts moved across the globe, seeking new homes to ensure the survival of their species.\nLost Kingdoms: Pangea in Pieces is a game of tile laying, tile shifting, and area control. Each player directs a different species of dinosaur, competing to have the most dinosaurs on each of the ever-changing landmasses.\nRoar and Write! \n It\u2019s time for the Selection Committee of the Animal Kingdom to choose the new monarch to rule over all. Now it\u2019s up to you to appease the five council members on the Selection Committee to win the Regency. The catch...each Committee member is appeased in a different way, so you must choose wisely as you can only appeal to one each Age.\nRoar and Write is a competitive press-your-luck game about impressing different council members on the selection committee, garnering favor throughout the five kingdoms, and completing your own personal objectives to rise to the top of the selection committee's choices for the new ruler of the Animal Kingdoms.\nPeople sometimes wonder why they should back a Kickstarter campaign instead of waiting to get the game later in retail. The most important reason not to wait with Kingdoms of the Deep is that even if Kingdoms of the Deep funds, we currently don't know if Kingdoms of the Deep will go into distribution. If you wait, you may end up missing out, as we won\u2019t have many extra copies to sell and unless your local store backs the campaign, they won\u2019t be carrying it either.\n Kickstarter Limited \u2013 Kingdoms of the Deep might be very hard to find after the campaign, outside of select conventions. \n Help Us Improve Kingdoms of the Deep \u2013 We have a ton of stretch goals planned to help improve the game for everyone!\n Discounted \u2013 After the campaign, we will sell the extra copies at a higher cost.\nMost importantly, without you, Kingdoms of the Deep would not get created.\nKingdoms of the Deep is a game we love and want to share with the world. We have been working on this game for several years to make it the best it can be. Kingdoms of the Deep brings together the things you loved from Animal Kingdoms and adds on a depth that we know you'll enjoy. We love playing and know you will, as well.\nWe really appreciate your support in making our dream a reality.\nWe would love to support game stores by offering the Kickstarter versions of Kingdoms of the Deep to retailers during the campaign. Back the project at the retailer level for $50, and we'll contact you closer to when we ship out rewards to get a count of games that you wish to get! An invoice will be sent to you before we ship your rewards.\nWe will be charging shipping after the campaign ends. This ensures you get charged the shipping you deserve. No more, no less.\nBy doing this, we are able to factor in your pledge tier, add-ons, and all fancy things that may occur during the campaign. However, we can offer estimated shipping costs. Below is estimated pricing for one copy of the game.\nPlease keep in mind these are estimates and there can be slight variations from country to country. Also, the more items you purchase, the more shipping will cost. If you have any questions, please email us at support@galacticraptorgames.com.\n*We are currently not planning to ship to the following areas: Mexico, Brazil, and Russia.\nTo order a second copy of Kingdoms of the Deep, add an additional $39 to your pledge with no additional shipping cost.\nWe are happy to discuss group orders, but these need to be handled on a country-by-country basis. Please send us a direct message including country and number of copies to discuss.\nWhat do you get when two board game publishers who love outer space and dinosaurs join forces? Galactic Raptor Games! That\u2019s right, Carla Kopp of Weird Giraffe Games (Tumble Town, Fire in the Library, Stellar Leap, Dreams of Tomorrow) and Dan Letzring of Letiman Games (Adventure Tactics, Groves, Neverland Rescue, Dino Dude Ranch) have joined forces to publish under their joint venture Galactic Raptor Games.\nOn top of our already successfully fulfilled game, Animal Kingdoms, we have both been in the industry for years and have delivered a combined total of 18 Kickstarter campaigns between the two of us. Combining our strengths will lead to a bigger and better future for our companies and for more fun games getting to your tables!\nWe love getting to know our community better, so be sure to connect with us on social media and say hi!\nKingdoms of the Deep is the third project by Galactic Raptor Games.\nThe Kingdoms of the Deep team is made of the following people:\nSTAY UP TO DATE ON KINGDOMS OF THE DEEP\nCheck out Kingdoms of the Deep on Board Game Geek  \nJoin our discord server \nFollow Galactic Raptor Games on Twitter \nLike Galactic Raptor Games on Facebook  \nFollow Galactic Raptor Games on Instagram \nJoin the Weird Raptor Discord Server ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAlthough Dan and Carla individually have already successfully funded and delivered 18 projects on Kickstarter, Kingdoms of the Deep will have it's own unique issues.

All card counts are subject to change. All card and component names are subject to change. All packaging is subject to change. Rules are subject to change. \n\nAs the game has not been manufactured yet, all images and descriptions are what we are aiming to create. It is possible during the production process that some items might change in appearance, functionality, size, or quantity. We will attempt to keep such changes to a minimum. \n\nFULFILLMENT \nBezier Games, Inc. has been publishing boardgames for more than 10 years. Several factors can cause delays that are beyond our control, including manufacturing issues and shipping delays. The COVID-19 pandemic could be a factor in possible delays; in all cases, we've tried to incorporate a reasonable level of padding into shipping estimates. \n\nThe estimated fulfillment is December 2021, but keep in mind that this is just an estimate, this year more than ever before. Also, due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others. \n\nRESTRICTED DELIVERY \nDue to increased frequency in Kickstarters failing to deliver to certain locations, Bezier Games, Inc. has decreased the amount of locations Kickstarter rewards may ship to. This is because of several reasons - the majority being issues of reward packages getting lost, stolen, being unable to clear customs. In addition to this, some countries have been removed due to heavily increased accounts of piracy. \n\nBezier Games, Inc. will only be shipping to the following locations: United States of America, Puerto Rico, Canada, United Kingdom, Europe (European Union, Albania, Andorra, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Bosnia & Herzegovina, Georgia, Iceland, Kosovo, Liechtenstein, Macao, Moldova, Monaco, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Norway, San Marino, Serbia, Switzerland, Turkey, Ukraine, Vatican City), Australia, New Zealand, China, Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore, Malaysia, South Korea, Taiwan, Philippines, and Military (APO)\n\nSHIPPING\nShipping is charged after the KS campaign concludes, based on the actual costs Bezier Games incurs to ship from distribution centers to your delivery address. All shipping & handling costs will be paid by backers through our BackerKit Pledge Manager. Links to this pledge manager will be sent roughly two weeks after the campaign ends. The BackerKit pledge manager is a 3rd party used to finalize orders and shipping outside of Kickstarter, Kickstarter has no responsibility in this regard. Shipping costs vary based on where you will have your reward delivered; we always do our very best to ensure backers the best price possible. \n\nAt the start of this campaign, we expect the box included with the Collector level and Royal level to be about 300 x 300 x 160mm (similar to the Suburbia Collector\u2019s Edition \u201cregular\u201d box) and weigh about 11 pounds. The Colossal level includes the same box, PLUS an additional box which we expect to be about 300 x 300 x 148mm, shipped together in a single carton weighing about 26 pounds. The shipping estimates below reflect these calculations.\n \nRegional applicable taxes will be calculated in the Pledge Manager as well. Our shipping is US, CA, EU, UK, AU friendly meaning rewards will ship from within these regions. Any VAT for EU and UK will be collected in the pledge manager.\n\nREFUNDS \nBezier Games, Inc. will do whatever they can to minimize the risks but, should a backer become uphappy, we are willing to refund pledges if issues should arise while the Pledge Manager is open. Refunds of 100% of collected funds are available within the first 14 days of a campaign's end. Past that, Kickstarter still needs to collect their portion of the pledge which we do not cover. This results in a 90% refund given if it is requested after the 14 day period. Once the Pledge Manager closes, refund requests will be reviewed on a case by case basis. \n\nThis project is being funded in USD and any refunds processed will be in USD for the exact amount received in USD, excluding any applicable fees depending on the time of the refund being processed. Bezier Games, Inc. is not responsible for changes in the rate of foreign exchange. \n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS \nBy pledging to this project, you agree to conduct all public interactions via Kickstarter's communications channels with this project and our team and other backers in a positive manner. Harassment, name-calling, or attempts to inject inappropriate content into the public communications channels will not be tolerated. Bezier Games, Inc. reserves the right to cancel any pledge. \n\nIf we ship to the address that you provided in our Pledge Manager and the package is returned to us as undeliverable you may be required to pay the full cost to ship your reward again to a revised address. \n\nIf we ship your reward to the address you provided in our Pledge Manager and the package tracking status shows as delivered to that address, but you are unable to receive it, or you have moved and are no longer the occupant of that address and cannot otherwise retrieve the package, or if the package is lost or stolen after delivery, and you wish to have the order fulfilled again, you may be required to pay the full cost to ship the order to a revised address in addition to the amount of the original reward including any add-ons and other upgrades on your order. \n\nIf we ship the reward to the address you provided in our Pledge Manager and the package is held in customs or by any other government agency, our ability to help may be limited. You may be required to contact your customs agency or government and arrange for the package to be cleared and released at your expense. We are not responsible for any fees levied against your pledge by customs or any government agency. We are not responsible for any refunds or re-shipments for packages held by customs or a government agency. \n\nOther than as noted elsewhere in these terms & conditions, if any part of your order cannot be fulfilled for any reason Bezier Games, Inc. will provide you with a pro-rated refund for that portion of your order. \n\nIf you do not log in to our Pledge Manager and confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email to confirm your pledge, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received. Bezier Games, Inc. reserves the right to deny or fulfill orders beyond these 8 weeks under our discretion.

We have seven full-time employees and four part-time employees. Like so many of you, we had various plans last year which were disrupted.  We pivoted into a ton of live coverage instead.  This year our goals are to:\n Continue to produce regular live content on a set schedule \nIncrease interaction with our listeners\n Continue to increase the quality of our current YouTube shows \n Produce more top ten lists with special guests \n Upgrade our equipment \nYou might notice that these are very similar to our goals in 2020, and that's because I want to focus even more on the quality of our streaming.  The Winter Spectacular was something we worked hard on, and we believe we can bring ALL of our content up to that level.  In this campaign, we have a myriad of cool rewards but we hope that your main goal in supporting this campaign is keeping the Dice Tower on the air.\nWe are dedicated to keeping the show and our videos free for download and viewing, and we appreciate you helping us in reaching that goal.  We ask you to consider giving above and beyond the cost of the rewards to maximize what we can do this year!\nPLAY\n\nGoing beyond our goal will allow us to do more for you on the channel!  Here are some of our stretch goals!\n\nWe have a pile of wonderful rewards to send out to you as a gift for backing our campaign.  We know the value of these rewards does not come close to the amount you are donating to the show but they are simply a small \"thank you\" gift that we are sending as a token of our appreciation.  We also ask that you look at them that way - to donate money to the show is the main goal of this campaign.\nThe following promos each have their own pledge level, but also can be added to a regular pledge.  Simply add the amount to your pledge and you can choose which ones you want at the end of the campaign.  Realize that some add-ons will accrue more international shipping at the end of the campaign.\nThere will also be some add-ons that are only added on in the pledge manager.  These will include (but are not limited to) promos from last year, and more!\nWe can only fit in a limited number of these rewards, so they are unlikely to be available in the pledge manager after the Kickstarter.\nEach Thursday, we do a live show of Boardgame Breakfast!  Want to show us up in the trivia section?  Backers will show up live in one of our Thursday Breakfasts for the game show section!\nWant your own Dice person?  Tina will draw you (based on a picture you send in) in the color die of your choice.  This is for non-commercial use, although the Dice Person may show up in a future Dice Tower video!\n\nPLAY\n\nA set of four (4) custom card trays.  These will hold at least 45 sleeved (American sized) cards and 60 unsleeved cards. Design isn't final - they will be clear plastic (same material as our component bins).  You will be able to push down on the cards to easily pull out the top card.  \nA custom monster for use in both King of Tokyo and King of New York!\n A new scenario designed for Gloomhaven: Jaws of the Lion!

This set will be available this year only.\nTina also created custom art for Werewolf cards!

Tom's favorite roles are included, as well as one or two new ones!\nGet our new 2021 Playmat!  (Dimensions - 23.75\" x 14\")   \nGet our larger new 2021 Playmat!  (Dimensions - 25\" x 20\").

You step up as the new ruler of your kingdom. Everything seems quiet at the beginning. You want to be a good ruler and do your best for your kingdom.  But you are surrounded by neighbors, and each of them wants to be the most powerful king in the region. They attack you, try to rob you by unfair trades, and crush your kingdom down. You need to fight back or your kingdom will fall down ingloriously.\nEach player controls a kingdom which is represented by the state of four resources - Influence, Wealth, Citizens, Military. The goal is really simple - either develop all your resources to their maximum or destroy your opponents by decreasing one of their resources below the minimum. But they are trying to do exactly the same.\nThe main mechanic is around collecting and playing the right cards at the right moment, complete successful trades with the other players, and prepare your defense wisely. Sounds simple enough, right?\nThere are several advanced rules which can be mixed up together and play the game the way you like it. There's also a special section about role-playing which can be included as well if you feel so.\n\nGameplay\nThe players take turns in which they can perform one action:\ndevelop the resources of their kingdom\nattack one opponent and harm their resources\ntrade with an opponent\ndo nothing and draw a card\nThey can play a combination of up to 4 cards. The more cards played the greater the effect of the cards is. However, each development or attack can be blocked by any other player.\nTrading is tricky. It can either help you collect the cards you need or you can be looted by your opponents.\nThe aim of the game is to become the king of the most powerful kingdom. So you need to increase all your resources to the maximum or slay your opponents by lowering one of their resources below the minimum.\nGameplay\n\nAdvanced rules\nThere are six advanced rules which can be mixed with the core game:\n Leader \u2013 include Jokers to help you build card combinations.\n Change in seasons \u2013 the weather can sometimes be unpredictable and either helps your kingdom or put it to test.\n Act of God \u2013 once in a while you experience an event so strong that you can\u2019t blame anybody but the gods. Their will can bless you or crush you down.\n Time shift \u2013 the deck you play with never runs out of cards until there\u2019s one clear winner.\n Kingdom party \u2013 bring up to four players to the table.\n Tell the story \u2013 describe what happens with your kingdom during each turn. This one is for the role-playing fans.\n\n  How does it stand from the crowd?\nRise: A tale of kingdoms uses something which probably we all have at home \u2013 a deck of standard playing cards. The cards offer incredibly high replay value and unlimited possibilities. What the game does is to translate a deck of standard playing cards into a board game. There are only two assets you need \u2013 a scoreboard for each player and a table to translate the cards. The rest is left for your imagination.\nThe core idea of the game is to present you with something so simple that you don\u2019t need to wait to be manufactured, delivered to your door, or even printed(if you don\u2019t have a printer you can literally draw what you need in 5 minutes on a piece of paper and reuse it for all your games). The game finds a balance between simplicity and challenge. Each game is different than the previous one and the setup takes less than a minute.\n\nWho is this game suitable for?\nRise: A tale of kingdoms is a game that can attract any player. It can be played by 2-4 players. The sessions are between 5-30 minutes. The game has the benefits of the games with standard playing cards \u2013 high replay value and super easy setup. You can start a session immediately after the previous one. Probably it\u2019s not a game that you will spend a whole weekend with your friends. But it\u2019s a game that you can play every day on and on. The advanced rules can add a unique taste to each game. You can use none, any, or all of them and play the game the way you like it.\nDon\u2019t forget the optional role-playing. Then tell the story of your kingdom and how it went through days of glory and how it slayed the opponent\u2019s armies.\n\nThe idea\nI created this game during the long periods of staying at home during 2020 (you all know what I\u2019m talking about). I was bored and I wanted to have a game which is simple and I can play with my wife in short sessions. I\u2019ve got inspired by the role-playing zine Beak, Feather, & Bone. It presented me with the idea of using standard playing cards mixed with board game elements. It just opened a whole new world for me.\nEvent though Rise: A tale of kingdoms is not a complicated game, it took significantly more time to develop it than I expected. I was naive to think that it\u2019s something which can be done in a weekend. Actually, it took me several months (of course I was doing that in my free time). But I really like what I did in the end. I hope you\u2019ll like it, too.\nRewards\nThere are 3 options for the bakers.

He also loves to 3D print and paint miniatures, most of which can be found on his Instagram @paintman_journeying.\n\nTabletop Simulator Adaptation\nPedro Feijao is a Mathematician turned Computer Scientist turned Bioinformatician, with a passion for video and board games. Originally from Brazil, after living in Germany for a while he settled in Vancouver, with his wife and 10-year-old son. Now working on a DNA-based Cancer diagnostics company called Canexia Health. In his spare time, he likes to play board games with my family, play basketball and program TTS mods for great board games!\nWhile there's a long way to go with the project still, I want to take a moment to thank all the people who have helped me get this far, from playtesters to enthusiastic fans. From people who played the game at virtual conventions this year, to people who have followed along on my newsletter. \nBut there are a few people I want to take an extra moment to give a shout-out to. \nThe Calgary playtesting community! Everyone who (pre-pandemic times) would come down to Sentry Box for playtesting nights and lend their time to playtesting The Transcontinental. But in particular, Paul Saxberg, Orin Bishop, Keith Donaldson, and Joseph McDaid (who also put together the trailer video here), put in countless hours and sessions on this game. I couldn't have done it without all their input. \nDuring this pandemic time, I've also helped out tremendously by having an online game design group to not only playtest but to act as a sounding board for ideas and to keep me accountable: Mark Yuasa of Test Coast Games, Marc Bennett, and Russel Fleming.\nA special shoutout as well to Chris Ewington, who, in addition to playtesting, helped out with working through some of the logistics of the Kickstarter campaign. \nThanks to Pedro Feijao for rescuing me from doing my own Tabletop Simulator scripting, and doing such a fantastic job with it. \nAnd lastly my wife and son, for their support and inspiration. I consider myself fortunate to live in a home with so much creativity. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhile this is my first Kickstarter, my background includes some time in logistics and fulfillment, so I'm familiar with a lot of the challenges that could come up, and I'm partnering with companies experienced with board game kickstarters for every step of the process, from manufacturing to shipping to fulfillment. \n\nWith the help of my partners, I've priced out both our base version as well as all stretch goals, freight and end-shipping. I'll have some artwork to finish up based on campaign input for cards, but proofing of other components (wood, boards, tiles) will begin immediately after the Kickstarter. Final proofing and manufacturing will begin after the Chinese holiday break, with delivery set for summer of 2021.

Meet, \nSmall, Fun, and Functional!\nNoise Machine is a super-duper teeny tiny wireless Midi Controller that doesn't compromise functionality for portability.\nThe main idea of Noise Machine was to create a portable instrument that had the same functionality as a keyboard in a package that you could easily take with you. Something fun to play, compact and functional that could accompany you on the bus, out for a walk, on a road trip, in a tree, you name it! Noise Machine works by wirelessly connecting to software on your smartphone, laptop, or PC/MAC. Consisting of 12 buttons, a knob, and a slider, Noise Machine allows you to choose from 12 different midi channels and offers 3 different modes of use...  All in a case that's smaller than your wallet!\n  Noise Machine was inspired by the need to have a tactile instrument outside of the studio without limitations!\n\nSpecial Offer,\nRecieve 7 Free Sample Packs from Pyro Audios Library for all New & Existing backers! \u2728\nAll you have to do is back, and you'll get a download code on Friday December 4th for 500+ samples that you can experiment with Noise Machine!\n- - -\n\"Pyro Audio is proud to offer a powerfully inspiring collection of sounds for backers of the Noise Machine ultra-portable wireless MIDI controller.

Plus, more surprises! \ud83d\ude09\n\n\nThe Hardware, \nGeneral\nConsisting of 12 buttons, a midi expression knob, and a slider, Noise Machine packs a lot of punch in an insanely small size! Utilizing ultra low latency BLE MIDI and entirely self contained, Noise Machine offers 100% wireless freedom to connect to major DAWs on a variety of different devices!\n12 Buttons \nNoise Machine comes equipped with 12 quiet, comfortable, and tactile buttons that will make you find any excuse to start mashing & making NOISE wherever you are!\nMIDI Expression Knob\nNoise Machines MIDI Expression Knob controls modulation by default, however you can reprogram it to do whatever you like! Cutoffs, filters, or even something as simple as volume. Twist away!\nOctave Slider\nUtilize Noise Machines Octave Slider to explore 7 different octaves across 12 notes in default mode. Stay in one octave, or jump between a few to open up even more possibilities!\nNoise Machine comes equipped with 3 integrated midi modes to choose from out of the box! Consisting of DEFAULT MODE, SPLIT MODE & LOOP MODE. \n\nDEFAULT\nDefault mode turns the 12 buttons included with Noise Machine into the 12 octaves of music theory (C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, A#, B). \nThe octave of the 12 notes can be changed with the octave slider, allowing 7 different octaves to be enabled on the fly.\nThe midi expression knob is set to modulation by default, but can be changed via software to control any Midi CC information.\n\nSPLIT MODE & LOOP MODE\nSPLIT MODE,\nSplit Mode is very similar to default mode. The key difference? The first 6 buttons are hooked to channel 1 and the last 6 buttons are hooked to channel 2. This change in layout allows you to play two different instruments at the same time, completely seperate from each other!\n\nLOOP MODE,\nOur take on a midi sequencer. Loop mode allows you to play any sequence of notes and have them played back to you at varying BPM (controlled by the midi CC knob).\nThe Octave Slider turns into a Midi Expression Slider while the loop is being played, letting you modulate the loop in real time!\nLoop Mode lets you add up to 16 notes/pauses and is perfect for a live environment.\n\nThe Nitty Gritty,\nUses form of low latency BLE MIDI (7.5 ms - 10 ms latency).\nChargeable via USB TYPE C, with charging indicator.\nCompatible with IOS, ANDROID, PC, MAC and synthesizers through MAC/PC Software.\nPower, Connect, and Channel LED's.\nOpen Sourced -- Through Arduino IDE.\nDimensions*: 54.3 x 60.3 x 11.4.\n* in Millimeters...yes!

The idea of having a portable midi machine that you could create, engage, and bring with you anywhere was the spark to the eventual creation of Noise Machine itself.\nGetting this far was not easy...\nThe countless hours spent hunched over our desks tinkering, building, and coding are testaments to how passionate we are about this project.\nWe went through six or seven different prototypes in the year and a half that elapsed from the first conceived thought of Noise Machine. These prototypes varied in size, functionality, and features (some were pretty wacky...), all of which culminated in the Noise Machine that you see today!\n  Noise Machine was unveiled back in May of 2020. In September of 2020 THIS.IS.NOISE Inc was founded as a vessel to carry Noise Machine towards its Kickstarter goal.\n\nWhy THIS.IS.NOISE Inc exists,\nUltimately, we come from a world of tangled wires, complex ecosystems, and bulky hardware. We realized that sometimes it's nice to have a break from that world and be able to simply, effectively, and creatively convey our musical abilities... not confined to one space.\nWe hope to pass on this feeling of creative freedom to our fans, and hear all the amazing things they can create wherever they may be.\n\nNoise Machine will be shipped worldwide,\nShipping will be charged after the campaign, where you can also confirm your rewards, address, and choose any add-ons. \nPlease note, that our prices do not include local taxes, duties, etc. that will be subject to the laws and regulations of each individual country/area. \nWhat is the shipping costs?\nShipping costs will be paid separately closer to the date of the shipping on our e-commerce platform. Due to the coronavirus, shipping prices are uncertain as of right now, so we cannot predict the exact cost in regards to shipping.\nWe currently expect the prices to be between$10-50 depending on the shipping area. We will do our best to streamline the shipping process, so you get the lowest prices and fastest delivery times!\n\nA HUGE thanks to our community, fans, and supporters who submitted art, graphic design, and video art during our call to action back in September. \ud83d\ude4c\nWe've attached the community fan art gallery below with props to the talented creators... You guys rock! \u270a\n@dangertapesky\n@yellow_salamandr\n@Anonymous\n@m.ssing_no\nPLAY\n\n^ And this awesome vid by @animoscillator! ^\n\nWe'd like to take a second to thank everyone that has decided to join us on this exciting journey! \nWhether you have just joined us for the first time, or you've been with us since the start, we have a deep appreciation for you helping us bring the music industry into the Portable Revolution...

Your objective as a deep-sea researcher is to guide your sub through fathoms of water, descending to the Trench floor, to find mysterious and amazing sea creatures.\nWill you become a renowned research scientist, or will you fall victim to the creatures that lurk beneath the surface?\nINTRODUCTION\nThe goal of The Mariana Trench is to score the most research points by researching deep-sea creatures and the floor of the trench. The game is played in alternating turns until your submarines run out of oxygen. \nMOVEMENT\nMovement from one card to the next represents a distance of 1000 Fathoms. At launch your sub can move up to 2000 fathoms (2 cards) on your turn. \nCOLLECTING RESEARCH AND UPGRADES\nWhen researching the water column, reveal the (research) card next to your sub. Each card displays a deep-sea creature and a submarine upgrade. \nYou may:\n\u2022 Collect the deep-sea creature, or\n\u2022 Upgrade your Submarine\nIf you do not collect the creature or upgrade your sub then leave the card face-up, where either player may collect it on a future turn.\nIf you have hold capacity you may tuck the research card under your sub (to the right), so that the class and size of the creature shows.\nIf you do not collect the sea creature then you can upgrade your sub. Tuck the card under your sub (to the left) so that the upgrade is showing. You cannot take the same upgrade twice.\nYour sub starts with a small hold, which can carry one small creature. To collect large creatures you must upgrade your hold first.  \n\nTHE TRENCH FLOOR\nEach time your sub reaches the trench floor you can conduct valuable scientific research. Take 1 research token from the supply and place it on your submarine. Your sub can only carry one research token at a time. The token is offloaded as soon as you surface beside the research vessel.  Research tokens are worth 2RP at the end of the game.\nRETURNING TO THE RESEARCH SHIP\nWhen your sub surfaces, all the creatures and tokens are offloaded to the research vessel. At the end of the game points are scored for different sets of creatures\nAnd there is more\u2026.\nOK, so we have the game, the expansion, and the play mat, we have a few awesome stretch goals to come too\u2026. But what else?\nOver the past three years I have been hugely fortunate to work in the board game industry, I\u2019ve had games published, I\u2019ve worked as an illustrator and designer on many fantastic and exciting games. \nBut now is the time, the time for me to develop the games I\u2019d like to play, the games I think you would like, games I'm passionate about which I'm itching to throw my creativity and time into. By backing this project, you are giving me the opportunity to exclusively make the absolute best games I can for you.\nWith two more amazing games in the pipeline for next year, I am massively excited for the future, I've got some amazing stuff to share. So, it\u2019s not all about buying this game, it\u2019s about investing in creative freedom and being part of an exciting journey and some amazing new games.\nTris Rossin.\nOwner of Bright Light Games.\n The cost of shipping will be charged after the campaign has ended in the pledge manager.

You can back from anywhere in the world at any tier\nThe House Doesn't Always Win - Front Cover (Design by @minus_tom)\nWhat is The House Doesn't Always Win?\nReclaim your lands, bring down oppressors, topple empires...\nThe House Doesn't Always Win is a zero-prep, tabletop role playing game about those who have been left with nothing fighting against those that hold everything. It runs entirely on a standard deck of playing cards and a single 10-sided die, can be run in any setting or theme and uses a unique, poker-like system to drive its game-play. The House Doesn't Always Win will transform your deck of cards into a high stakes game of pushing your luck and fighting against your oppressors. Sessions are full of heist-like plans gone awry, fragile allegiances between allies around the table beginning to crack under pressure, and constant morbid curiosity for exactly what card is currently sitting on top of the deck.\nA completely unique set of mechanics designed from the ground up to fit your characters' struggles... \nThe House Doesn't Always Win is built on a unique set of mechanics that bring your deck of cards to life. The diamonds are your targets, those you need to destroy to remake the world in your favour. The Kings, Queens, and Jacks are your characters, those fighting to change what keeps them down. Everything else is all the influence, allies, favours, equipment, and luck you've managed to scrape together to attempt this paradigm shift. Once the game starts, it's not just how the cards are dealt, but how you play them that will ultimately decide your fate. \nDefy the odds or die trying in a world where the slightest mistake can cost you everything...\nWhat you're attempting is not going to be easy, in fact, it's an enormous gamble, but if you liked the odds you wouldn't be here in the first place. The House Doesn't Always Win is a game of high tensions and situations that exist on a knife-edge - where failure is always avoidable but takes no prisoners. The odds are always changing as cards are discarded and removed from the deck and with everyone sharing the deck between them, every action is important, not just your own.\nA spade, heart and club come together to burn down the heraldry of their oppressors. (Art by @riotbones)\nHow does it play?\nFast setup and easy to understand rules remove the barriers between the players and the game...\nThe House Doesn't Always Win strips away the need for pages and pages of rules that most games require you to learn without sacrificing interesting moment to moment decisions. Suitable for advanced TTRPG players looking for something different as well as new players looking for a fast and easy to learn system - It's fast to pick up and set up and is infinitely repayable in whatever setting you choose, suitable for quick and deadly one-shots or multi-session narratively linked campaigns. \nA series of interlocking mechanics, all hiding within a simple deck of cards...\nEverything in The House Doesn't Always Win will have you keeping your attention on the deck of cards in the centre of the table:\nThe diamonds are removed from the deck at the start and all the picture cards of that suit will represent the targets you'll need to take down in your campaign; the head of the snake must be removed to kill the constricting body. \nNumbered diamond cards are laid out on the table and represent important pieces of information, contacts, and assets that the diamonds covet; find and claim them during play to manipulate the odds in your favour. \nCharacter creation is as simple as choosing a card to play as; Jack, Queens, and Kings all have their own unique powers and your chosen suit will aid you in challenges to come and inform how your character plays.\nAttempt risky and dangerous actions by drawing from the deck one card at a time, looking to draw a certain amount of cards in one of three suits. Draw too many of the wrong suit and you risk going bust and losing every card you've drawn for the rest of the game, permanently weakening your chances and possibly even removing characters from play. \nAn innovative 'folding' mechanic allows you to pull away from potentially devastating actions when the risk becomes too great - swapping boring, single chance dice rolls for a nail-biting, push-your-luck, extended draw that could see glory or tragedy with every card taken from the deck. Actions have consequences, not just in the narrative, but in the mechanics themselves. \nThe House Doesn't Always Win feels like...\nA hitman level run by a croupier, a high stakes game of poker mixed with Russian roulette, classic heist movies, David taking down Goliath, putting everything on black, knowing you stand to gain or lose everything, knowing you have no other choice. \nYou'll shout in triumph and cry out in agony from merely turning over a card. Your characters will suffer hardships and if they're lucky, narrowly escape with their lives, but should they succeed against all odds; their names will go down in history.\nA spade looks ahead at the gauntlet that awaits them before the King of Diamond's tower.

It\u2019s only a matter of time until the allure of Corruption becomes unstoppable, in all its devastating effects.\n\nStrategic choices will be crucial for the destiny of Faeriell and for your Tribe of Weybits. Will you cooperate with other players or part ways?\nThese are photorealistic renders. Please take into consideration that the final product may differ.\nFor an extended and detailed explanation of the rules, check this video:\nWatch below an English Playthrough of the game:\nInspired by the lush nature of Faeriell, we will involve our supporters in the Tree-Nation project, aimed to reforest areas of the world in need. The Tree-Nation Add-on gives us the opportunity to plant new trees and see how our efforts will improve the environment. Everyone involved will be able to see how much the CO2 levels will decrease in the new forest region.\n  By choosing the Tree-Nation Add-On, you will receive a certificate that proves your contribution for planting a tree, with its geo-localization. Our partner, Tree-Nation, will provide additional information about the results of the overall project. Let's plant a forest together!\nSons of Faeriell is Dice Tower's Peek of the Week!\nCooperation against Corruption \nDoom is the inevitable outcome of Corruption, and its rise during the game represents a threat to all players. If they don't team up and direct their choices to constrain Corruption, they all risk to lose together against the game. Corruption Events are specific situations in which a player has to decide whether to intervene for the sake of the group, or put their individual goals before everything else.\nControlled randomness \nGame events happen during the production phases, which are resolved at every player\u2019s turn. First, the active player decides which regions or areas will produce, then they have to draw a limited number of tokens from a bag, to determine the status of the Great Guardians in that turn. At every draft, the probability of certain events to happen narrows further and further and players are able to adjust their strategy accordingly.\nAsymmetric characters abilities and development\nWeybits are characters guided by players, represented by highly detailed miniatures. Putting on their Tribe Masks, each Weybit becomes a specific Hero with asymmetric starting abilities, related to the color of each resource. Heroes can level up and acquire new Perks of different kinds, which grant all sorts of additional powers and combo triggers.\nAlternate phase resolution \nEvery phase of the game offers many possible courses of action in a short span of playing time, allowing players to perform tactical moves with high flexibility. This removes the problem of downtime between the players' turns. Moreover, the phases are resolved in the order chosen by each player at every turn, causing difficulties to the opponents in full competitive mode, or following the interests of the group for cooperative purposes.\nCorruption Sower \nPlayers can aim to different winning conditions, thanks to a mechanic designed to prevent runaway leader or stall situations. The Corruption Sower is a new kind of character that enters in play as a consequence of the player\u2019s choices, which flips the competitive side of the game to a run to make all other players lose to the Doom.\nIn the verdant regions of Faeriell, the Great Guardians were living peacefully since the dawn of time, protecting the balance of nature with their majestic presence.\n\nWhen the first Weybit explorers started to appear and decided to settle, it was a joyful surprise. The Great Guardians observed with interest how quickly these tiny and industrious humanoids learned to live in harmony with the environment. An alliance was forged, and it turned out to be a blessing, for the harsh times that were about to come.\n  Lately, the Weybits are getting greedy and competitive like never before, and most of them don\u2019t even know why. In this unsettling scenario, a new menace is rising and some are already whispering its name, calling it Corruption. This luring shadow is causing plants, animals and even the Great Guardians to suffer devastating effects, and patches of darkness are devouring the bright colors of nature all over Faeriell.\n  Weybits are the only inhabitants of Faeriell able to constrain Corruption, though they are also the most likely to fall for its bait. Weybit Tribes are encouraging their most talented Heroes to prove themselves, help the Great Guardians in need and give a hope to the lush land they just started to call home. \nThe Essence of Faeriell is a force that pervades all life, from the smaller grain of sand to the majestic Great Guardians. Each environment is tuned to a different domain of the Essence, and Weybits have learned to retrieve inspiration and resources from the land to express their extraordinary abilities to their fullest.\nThe gigantic and peaceful Great Guardians are as ancient as the land itself. They are an emanation of the essence of Faeriell, one with the nature they protect. \n\nThroughout years of spontaneous friendship and mutual curiosity, Weybits have learned a lot about these incredible creatures, so much that they are the only ones able to help them against Corruption.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our eighth Kickstarter campaign, during these years we\u2019ve gained the expertise and know-how to confidently produce high quality games the way we envision them.\nNonetheless we\u2019ve also learned production, quality control and shipping are delicate phases that can bring unexpected issues that may take some time to solve. For this reason the delivery date, October 2021, is an estimate. While we will do everything in our power to meet this date or even anticipate it, we are aware that slight delays are possible for reasons outside of our control. Also, exact delivery dates could vary depending on where you live.\nIf you have any question, concern or issue write to support@tabula.games and we will be happy to assist you.\nBy pledging for this project you accept the following terms:\nGeneral Terms:\n- This is not a pre-order and the final product may be subject to changes and improvements from what is presented here to ensure smoother production and logistics. This includes every aspect of the game, from miniature design to artworks and layouts.\n- We will only answer to support requests from our backers. If you got the game somewhere else (reseller, friend, group pledge, etc.) you will have to contact us through them.\n- After 30 days from the delivery date to your door, we will not accept complaints related to the game box contents of this campaign (missing components, damaged components, etc.).\n- After 6 months from the shipment date, we will not accept complaints related to the shipment of items of this campaign (damaged package, lost or missing contents, etc.).\n- After 12 months from the shipment date, we will not accept any complaints related to this campaign.\nRefunds:\n- An order can be canceled and fully refunded before the end of the campaign by clicking on the applicable button on Kickstarter.\nAfter the end of the campaign, the order can still be canceled within 14 days by sending us an email with your cancellation request. Please note that in this case the refund will not include the processing costs and Kickstarter fees, which will be deducted from your total. Apart from the cases specified here, the order is considered valid and is not refundable.\nShipping:\n- It\u2019s ultimately your responsibility to respond to our post-campaign survey to claim your rewards and to give us information about your shipping address and add-on choices. If you ignore our Last Call notification for more than 4 weeks we will consider your pledge a donation and we won\u2019t be able to ship you a reward.\n- One week after our Address Lockdown notification we will lock all your address and forward all delivery information to our fulfillment partners and this mean we will be unable to make any kind of change to your address. If you think your address might change during the delivery period we advise you to have the game shipped at another address you trust (friend, relative, workplace, etc.).\n- If the game fails to arrive because of your mistake (wrong address, recipient absent, failure to pick up at courier/postal warehouse, etc.), any additional shipping/warehousing cost for us to re-send/re-deliver your game will be your responsibility. This also includes the costs associated with returning the game. If after investigation it becomes clear that the error was on our part, we will resend your package at our expense.\n- If the package is lost, destroyed or damaged, the carrier will be held solely responsible. Any customer claim to the carrier needs to be made at the time of delivery, not later. If the package seems damaged, please ask the postal carrier to make you a receipt \"accepted with reserve\".\n- Please note that we will not reship any game without first investigating what happened to the first shipment.\n- If your game arrives with missing or damaged components, provide us with proof and we will substitute them once we have verified the damage.\n- We currently have agreements with our fulfillment partners to ensure that no custom taxes will be charged for shipments in USA, EU, CA, AU. However if between the end of our campaign and the start of fulfillment governments decide to impose new tariffs or taxes about imports we might be forced to adjust to the new policies.\n- If you live outside of the USA, EU, CA, AU customs taxes may be added.

The biggest foreseeable risks we currently face are COVID delays, manufacturing in China, and shipping issues from China to our warehouse here in the US.\n\nEach of these risks is greatly minimized with Calliope Games. Our factories have been with us for many years. They know how we work and the quality we expect. In addition, our freight forwarder and fulfillment teams are world class and have over 30 years of expertise to rely upon. If any issues arise, we will know of them far in advance and will be able to overcome them.\n\nNew tariffs may influence costs as well. Typically these are 10%-25% of our total manufacturing cost.

All card counts are approximate and are subject to change. All card and component names are subject to change. All packaging is subject to change and is not finalized. Rules are subject to change.\n\nThere are always risks associated with manufacturing and logistics, especially when working with international partners. Problems can delay or otherwise impact our ability to meet our commitments to our backers.\n\nThese issues include (but are not limited to):\n\n* Production delays\n* Shipping delays\n* Customs delays\n\nThe estimated delivery date is June 2021, but keep in mind this is only an estimate. Due to the logistics of international shipping in this unpredictable time, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others.\n\nWe've done our best to minimize these risks as much as possible, and we are happy to refund pledges if for some reason the game can't be delivered at all.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nAt your request we can give you a full refund within 14 days of the campaign\u2019s end, fees included. After that we will subtract Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we can\u2019t get back from Kickstarter after 14 days). Those fees usually equal 8% of the total pledge.\n\nRefunds will be processed through Kickstarter and will be applied to whatever payment method you provided to Kickstarter. In the event that is impossible we will work with you to arrange a refund through other channels.\n\nOnce we have shipped your Reward our refund policy will depend on the circumstances and will be at our discretion.\n\nThis project is being funded in USD and any refunds processed will be in USD for the exact amount received in USD, excluding any applicable fees depending on the time of the refund being processed.

We want the communications channels for this campaign to be a friendly, positive place for our community to gather and discuss the campaign, ask questions, and provide input.\n\nSly Game Design (henceforth referred to as SGD) reserves the right to cancel any pledge (with a full refund) at any time, for any reason. If your pledge is cancelled while the campaign is ongoing you agree not to re-pledge either under your original account or under any other account you control. Violations of this policy will be reported to Kickstarter.\n\nMinor cosmetic damage to the box or other packaging can occur during shipping. SGD makes reasonable efforts to ensure that the shipping containers it uses are suitable for the safe delivery of rewards. If you believe that your reward has suffered more than minor cosmetic damage please contact us immediately. Keep all packaging including outer cartons for our inspection. SGD will at its sole discretion determine if the damage constitutes other than minor cosmetic damage and/or was the result of insufficient packaging.\n\nIf we ship to the address that you provided in our Pledge Manager and the package is returned to us as undeliverable you will pay the full cost to ship the Reward again to a revised address.\n\nIf we ship the Reward to the address you provided in our Pledge Manager and the package is delivered to that address but you are unable to receive it, or you have moved and are no longer the occupant of that address and cannot otherwise retrieve the package, or if the package is lost or stolen after delivery, and you wish to have the order fulfilled again you will pay the full cost to ship the order to a revised address plus the amount of the original Reward.\n\nIf we ship the Reward to the address you provided in our Pledge Manager and the package is held in customs or by any other government agency, our ability to help may be limited. You may be required to contact your customs agency or government and arrange for the package to be cleared and released at your expense.

My name is Marsio Salcuni, and I am a lover of Music, Physics and Magnetism, and one day, I got the idea of combining these three things in my own way! ... And I must admit that it didn't go badly ... That idea gave me the opportunity to build my first X-PICK, and start having fun experimenting and playing ... As you can see from the videos, however, I started to understand that it was much more important than just having fun ... Starting to know how to use it, I discovered that it is a set of everything a guitarist or bassist should have always with him ... All enclosed in a little gem! ...\nI apologize for the guitar or Bass performances, but in my defense, I delight more in singing, and this strengthens my desire to see my X-PICK in the hands of REAL GUITARISTS or BASS PLAYERS, to see the thousand other facets that they are able to discover (moreover because each of you has different instruments, amplifiers, settings, etc ... and being Magnetic Fields, they will always be different, with different results, different sounds etc ...)\nEach of you will contribute to the growth of the X-Pick's capabilities, and yours! Because you will have 1000 more ways to MAKE MUSIC!\n\n\nThe X-PICK has a size of 24 mm x 25 mm.\nIt has a thickness of 4 mm and has a well-defined tip, but with a very wide angle, such as to facilitate simple picking or normal fast picking.\nThe DESIGN, combined with the type of MAGNETIZATION, never creates problems of too much attraction towards the strings ... The maximum magnetic degree, is poured only on the faces of the magnet as Physics teaches us, and strong enough, but calculated, on the back of the X-Pick to use magnetic field modulation techniques! ... It is obvious, for example, that the bass strings suffer more attraction, given their thickness, but this in no way prevents the fast and precise picking, as you have seen from the videos because you can take advantage also of a Magnetic Trick, to improve Normal Picking and Fast Picking:\nExactly at the tip, at the union between the North and South magnetic fields, there is no attraction with the iron strings, but an imperceptible, but decisive repulsive force is felt, which facilitates the Picking, as if the string were thrown.\nThe reason is that the iron atoms of the string, being close to both polarities almost simultaneously (i.e. picking) do not have time to reorient themselves for the attraction, and combined with the fact that the power of magnetism always focuses on the faces of a magnet, I opted for axial magnetization that collides the opposite magnetic fields, right in the tip, and I created this kind of magnetism game to facilitate and speed up the movement of the pick ...\nThe rear corners are cut in order to facilitate the use of some particular techniques, and ensure the right degree of magnetism in the interaction between magnetic fields with the Pickups.\nIt has very smooth lateral surfaces to slide on the strings like a slide would and the back is the one that has the most magnetic degree, because it is the widest, suitable for all the innovative techniques that require magnetic field modulations of the pick-ups of the instruments\nThe direction of magnetization of the pick is AXIAL, in such a way as to adapt to any type of polarity of the pick ups on the market:\n\nPOLARITY (with a compass):\nPLAY\n\nMAGNETIC FIELDS (with iron powder):\nPLAY\n\nSo, when you hold the X-Pick in your hand, it will be a normal pick size for you, while the PickUps of the instrument, thanks to the high degree of magnetism N52 of the Neodymium, they will see the equivalent of a magnetic soccer ball moving over them.\nAnd this will give you a lot of leeway in the distance with which to interact on the pick ups, adjust the Gain, the Tones and the Volume of the amplifier, to have a personalized sound so in detail, that you will be truly amazed! ...\n\n\n\nROUND PLASTIC CASE, TO PROTECT THE X-PICK AND ALWAYS CARRY IT WITH YOU !!\nCASE TO SHOW IT IN ALL ITS SPLENDOR AT YOUR HOME, \nWHERE YOU PLAY WITH YOUR BAND, \nOR IN THE SHOWCASE OF YOUR SHOP, \nOR FOR A PHANTASMAGORIC GIFT TO GIVE TO A MUSICIAN !!\n IT IS COMPOSED BY: \n- A WOODEN BOX,\n- VELVET BEARING E\n- NON-SLIP MAGNET,\nWHICH ALLOWS THE X-PICK TO REMAIN ERECTED FOR EXPOSURE, IN FRONT OF THE LOGO THAT IS ALSO PRESENT INSIDE ...\n- AND IN ADDITION WITH THE CHOICE \"EXPO\" YOU WILL ALSO HAVE THE \"TACTICAL\" CASE TO PROTECT THE X-PICK AND TAKE IT WITH YOU ...\nPs. The X-Pick packages may vary a little, but only BETTER than those shown! Because if I find them more beautiful and in recyclable material, if I can have the logo engraved on the box directly, at a decent cost, I want my customers and my planet to be happier and happier!\n\n\nAnd therefore, describing what happens, when I bring the X-Pick closer and away from the pick up of the instrument, there is a field modulation of the electromagnetic coils, with consequent change of shape, direction and intensity of the magnetic field between the X-Pick and the pick ups, to produce a different sound than usual ...\nUsing the X-Pick, you can change - IN REAL TIME - THE POSITION, THE SHAPE, THE POWER, THE INTENSITY, etc ... of the PICK UP, which will have their fixed magnetic field, modulated by a magnetic brother who moves on them!\nAS IF YOU CREATED A DIFFERENT PICK UP FOR EVERY PICK POSITION, ADAPTABLE TO EVERY KIND OF NEED ...\n\n\n\nPLECTRUM:\nNew approach in the use of the Pick, with the use of the Magnetic Trick explained above, to improve control and speed up the Pick;\n\n\nBODY & CRISTALLINITY OF SOUND:\nCrystallinity and Body of Sound thanks to this innovative material, the Neodymium, which makes it seem to ALWAYS PLAY WITH NEW STRINGS!\n\n\nSLIDE:\nA Wonderfull Slide, again thanks to Neodymium, which guarantees a Great Sustain! ... but also under another aspect: Finally you will use the Slide with the right hand in an agile way, leaving the left free to put chords, managing to act even only on the single note !! ...\n\n\nPICK \u2013 TAPPING or \"TAPPICK\":\nThe Pick that will allow you to give a brilliant and perfect note just to contact, without having to press the string on the fret like a Viking, like with normal picks! In fact, it makes the notes shine even where there is no guitar fretboard, so much that you will use it for magnificent and wild tapping, where no one has gone before!\n\n\nBRUSHES EFFECT:\nSound produced only by the magnetic fields, bringing the pick closer to the Pick Up, and making them pass the strings, one by one or all together to create the rolls;\n\n\nMAGNETIC FIELDS DELAY:\nDelay of any kind of sound you want; Just one touch on the note or chords, like the classic pedalboards, and then you have Total Control over the Delay ... You'll be able to slow down or speed up the delay, accentuate it, change the sound in real time ... A simple delay pedal, to do this, IT SHOULD READ IN YOUR MIND!\n\n\nPOWER & ETERNAL SUSTAIN or ELECTRIC VIOLIN:\nOnly sliding on the string gently, with the back or side of the X-Pick; HOW MANY TIMES HAVE YOU HOPED THAT YOUR BENDING WILL LAST IN ETERNAL GARY MOORE STYLE ???? ... NOW YOU CAN DO IT TOO !!! ALSO RECOMMENDED FOR LESS EXPENSIVE AND PERFORMING GUITARS !!\nOCTAVER:\nJust slipping on the string with the back of the pick, adds more than an octave to the traditional guitar fretboard with a bright and powerful sound!\n\n\nHYPER PICKING:\nTHE TECHNIQUE BORN WITH THE X-PICK, that will allow you to play without touching the strings, and to interact only through magnetic fields! In this case the change in polarity of the magnetic field acts (Attraction/Repulsion), because the movement of the pick is right - left with respect to the string ...\n\n\nMAGNETIC FIELDS TREMOLO:\nOTHER X-PICK TECHNIQUE, which differs from Hyper Picking, because the movement of the Pick with respect to the strings is up and down, that is, close to and away from the string quickly ... In this case there is Compression of Magnetic Fields (Only Repulsion) ... TECHNIQUE THAT FINALLY WILL MAKES TREMOLO POSSIBLE EVEN ON LEVER-LESS GUITARS!\n\n\nREVERSE / ROTARY:\nTechnique that thanks to the magnetic fields, will gives us the possibility of having these effects even without a pedal board ... And then ... How many times have you brought the effects pedals to an evening of the band, to use them in a single song?\n\n\n EPIC ATTACK: \"THE GOD OF ROCK\" \nVersatile and Innovative Pick Attack thanks to Neodymium, and speaking personally, it is one of the most exciting things this little treasure will makes with your support!\n\n\nULTRA MAGNETIC CONVENIENCE:\nYou will be able to magnetically attach your X-Pick wherever you want thanks to the high magnetic degree: to an iron necklace, a bracelet, a belt, a ring, near any small iron part or small part of the same guitar as I did in the video , and speed up your changes from accompaniment to solo! ...\n\n\nMANY EFFECTS TO BE DISCOVERED:\nIn addition to the one shown above, and that you could see from the videos, you must keep in mind that the combinations of use of the X-Pick are infinite ... I am talking about the all different instruments we have, and therefore with different magnetic fields, completely new results , or used together with different pedals, amplifiers of various brands and powers, and I could go on forever as you well know\u2026 SO IT'S A NEW WORLD TO BE COMPLETELY DISCOVERED BY EACH OF YOU !!!\n\n\nATTACH OBJECTS WHERE YOU WANT:\nHang a sheet on the refrigerator, Hang a screwdriver or hammer, Hang up the cell phone, ...\n\n\nLEARN SCIENCE OF MAGNETISM:\nWith a Magnet so strong, it will be easier to learn the rules of magnetism at school, at home, anywhere ...\n\n\nMAGNETIZE OBJECTS:\nSuch as Screwdrivers, screws, Knives, paper clips, etc .\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, let's get to the description of the object; this magnetic pick is made with material named Neodymium, from the category of rare earth permanent magnets, is chemically composed with NdFeB (Neodymium-Iron-Boron) and will have a coating that can be of different types ...\nLet's do some clarity ... Why are neodymium magnets so strong?\nNeodymium magnets are often referred to as super magnets. They are, compared to ferrite, much more attractive. Some of them are six hundred times their weight. Energy density is expressed in kilo joules per cubic meter (kJ / m3). To illustrate the difference between ferrite and neodymium magnets, there is a numerical example: ferrite magnets usually have an energy density of around 30 kJ / m3. Neodymium magnets, on the other hand, have a maximum energy density almost 20 times higher, i.e. around 500 kJ / m3. Most of these are not used in the private sector, but are preferred in industry or similar work areas. The reason for their enormous adhesive power is in the chemical compound and crystal structure. This has great anisotropy and extremely high coercive field strengths. This summary table is only demonstrative, but it is very close to the actual one of our Magnetic Pick:\nCOATING OF THE MAGNETS IN GENERAL AND THE ONE CHOSEN FOR THE X-PICK\nThe surfaces must be sealed with a protective layer. For this step, the material must be thoroughly clean and dry. There are many different magnetic coatings for the production of neodymium magnets. The most commonly used coating is a Ni-Cu-Ni coating, that is, a nickel-copper-nickel composition. Other possible coatings are:\nGold plating (Ni-Cu-Ni-Au) Chromium (Ni-Cu-Ni-Cr) Copper (Ni-Cu)Zinc (Zn)\nEpoxy resin (Ni-Cu-Ni- Epoxy)\n... and I chose Epoxy Resin so as to give more grip in contact with the fingers ...\n\u2026 as well as for protection from wear \u2026\n\n\nI tried to make the X-Pick by myself, like the ones you see in the videos\u2026 I made them all by hand with the cutter; but there is a problem ... If magnets reach a critical heat point, they lose a lot of their magnetism, and with the cutter or any other tool, that point is far surpassed! ... And it is for this reason that I am collaborating with a magnet manufacturers, to have my custom patent (pending) made ... It is the only way for the moment, at least until I can afford to open a business independently ...\nUnfortunately, this company need a substantial amount of X-PICK to give me an advantageous quote, for various reasons:\nThe first is the cost of the material, the more it is, the less they pay for it too;\nThe Second is for all instruments and processes for magnetization to grade N52;\nThe third and most expensive is the mold created specifically for this patent (pending); of which they asked me to contribute with the cost of the realization, because the company cannot use it for any other purpose ... \nIn fact, the products that I will ship, will be produced with:\nMAGNETIC CERTIFICATION,\nALL THE SAME AND PERFECT, THANKS TO THE MOLD OF MY PATENT (Pending),\nWITH A COATING AGAINST WEAR, AND TO IMPROVE THE GRIP BETWEEN THE FINGERS,\nWITHOUT THE MINIMAL DEFECT OR IMPERFECTION!\nBut all this has a cost, namely the amount of the loan, structured to fall within the minimum order possible to make this company accept to make the aforementioned mold for my X-PICK.\nI am doing my best to make my little dream come true but I would need some of your help ... \nAnd to thank you, I show you the birth of the X-Pick!\nPLAY\n\n\n\nOn a technical level:\nWhen you'll playing with the X-Pick, you will not hear those annoying hums due to too high gain or too open tones or exaggerated volumes ... This happens because the X-Pick, being made of ferrous material and magnetic, in contact with the strings, IMPROVE THE GROUNDING SYSTEM OF THE INSTRUMENT, closing better the mass that makes the usual turn in your body only from the left hand; a round of Grounding that is usually stopped by the normal picks of non-conducting material ...\nDemostration:\nPLAY\n\nAlso, again in relation to grounding, IT HELPS TO CONTROL AND DISSIPATE THE EDGE CURRENTS that accumulate from time to time on strings, making you even get shocked! And I bet you all know what I'm talking about! ...\n\nAnd then on a philosophical level:\nAnd for this I have to go a little personal ... Well, I'm one of those who sweated with work and the few savings his GIBSON LES PAUL STUDIO, and this desire to have it, created a bond ... let's say I'm one of those who believe that every instrument has a SOUL, a CONSCIENCE, and an OPINION to express\u2026 And when I play, I speak to her! SHE TALK TO ME! ...\nSo why not give maximum voice to this essence? ...\nLET YOUR GUITAR OR BASS EXPRESS, IN NEW WAYS, WITH SOUNDS THAT HAVE NEVER HEARD OR PRODUCED, WITH NEW TECHNIQUES ... NEW VIBRATIONS !! ...\nMY GUITAR WILL ALWAYS BE GRATEFUL FOR THE X-PICK ... IT FEELS ...\n\nAh, I just wanted to show you who I am ... \nPleased to meet you ...", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs I said before, I managed to create my first X-Pick by myself, but with consequent loss of magnetism ... In fact, to work the so-called permanent rare earth magnets with high magnetic potential, you need a lot of machinery, expensive machinery, that only a company already started and that does only this can have.\n\nI do not have the presumption of wanting to open a magnet company immediately, but simply to collaborate with one of these companies, so that they develop a special mold of my patent and provide to magnetization and coating. By proceeding in this way, I will be able to start creating a way forward, because Rome wasn't built in a day! And I tell you as an Italian! That's it! \u2026 \n\nThings start small, and if you've read this far, I'm sure you'll help me take a small step !!
