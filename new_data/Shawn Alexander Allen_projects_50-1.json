Subscribe to our newsletter!\nWant to Wishlist the game on Steam? Do that here!\nYou can also Follow us on Twitter or join our Discord.\n\nABOUT THE GAME\nWhisker Squadron is our fresh take on forward scrolling aerial combat, featuring feline heroes, dynamic missions, and procedurally generated bosses and worlds!\nComing to PC and consoles in 2022\n Wishlist on Steam | Website | Twitter | Facebook | \n\nHey everyone! \nWe are Flippfly, the team behind 2013's Race The Sun. We are so excited to let you know about our new project, Whisker Squadron!\nClick banner to wishlist Whisker Squadron right now!\nWhisker Squadron is the culmination of a creative spark that was lit over 20 years ago, and that has burned in us through our careers, and strengthened by modern indie games. When we created Race The Sun in 2013, we took aesthetic cues from classic low-poly games like Star Fox for the Super Nintendo, and created something with a uniquely minimalist feeling that was loved by our fans. Ever since that project shipped, we\u2019ve talked about creating a follow up that was more combat-focused, and that pushed the procedurally-generated elements even further.\n\nWhisker Squadron is that game.\n\nChoose your pilot and fight your way through procedurally-generated worlds and epic, procedurally-generated boss fights. You've got one life, and your tactical upgrade choices will be crucial to your success in this aerial roguelike.\n\nEngage in epic aerial combat with your feline pilot of choice\nTake on a series of epic, procedurally-generated boss fights\nFight your way through dynamic worlds in a mission that's unique every time you play it\nAnd there's more:\nProcedurally generated, rogue-like mission structure that's unique every time you play\nIncredibly dynamic procedurally-generated bosses that make for intense climax to every act\nChoose your pilots from a cast of 3 feline heroes\nDaily challenges and leaderboards\nDon't just take our word for it! Here is what the games press is saying about Whisker Squadron:\n\u201cSome of the bosses look downright inspired\u201d - PC Gamer \n\u201cIf this is where the game is starting in the public eye, I can\u2019t wait to see where it ends up.\u201d - Polygon \n\u201cIt's early days yet, but yeah, I'd play this\u201d - Rock Paper Shotgun \n\u201cWhile on the surface Whisker Squadron looks like Starfox with cats, the addition of Race the Sun\u2019s elements make it a very different game.\u201d - Hardcore Gamer \n\u201cThe foundation of a tried and true rail shooter mixed with procedurally-generated level design, roguelike gameplay, and striking art design is a solid one for Flippfly.\u201d - Shacknews \nWhisker Squadron is a corridor shooter with procedurally generated worlds, some light roguelike elements, and a cast of cats! Pilot your ship, avoiding obstacles and blasting the autonomous bots built by the sinister PAW Technologies corporation in an effort to save the galaxy from out of control algorithms bent on planetary destruction.\n\nThe game follows an action rogue-like formula: You get a single life to play through a 3-act campaign through several worlds and random space encounters, each with their own looks and threats. Challenge yourself to acquire higher rankings by avoiding damage, blasting all the bots, and keeping your multiplier high to earn the most rewards for beating each world.\nChallenge isn't everything, so we also offer a set of customizable gameplay settings instead of traditional difficulty settings. Start with more shields on your ship? Encounter less enemies? Get health pickups at the end of each world? Go for it!\nAnd if you want a nightmare, the settings will be there for you masochist-cats as well...mewhahaha\nDynamic mission map\n\nPlay as multiple characters, each with their own unique special weapon. Along the way you'll encounter shops and events to acquire a choice of new weapons and items to powerup as you make your way across the galaxy to stop the bots. Each play-through is unique, with each world being procedurally generated from a set of 'pattern' chunks, and a map that presents different connections and choices.\nAnd it's not just the worlds which are generated: each act culminates with an epic battle against a large enemy bot, and the bots are always looking for improvements so you'll have to keep on your toes each play-through because this bot is procedurally generated for a unique battle each time!\nJin is our character artist, and has drawn our wonderful cast of cats. Here's a few of them:\nSean is leading the way on the visual development for the game, using the custom world editor that we\u2019ve built for this game. We\u2019re evolving the minimalist style we developed with Race The Sun, and adding layers of visual flair on top. What you see on this Kickstarter page is a work-in-progress. We\u2019re improving the visuals more every week, and we\u2019re confident that the final look will blow you away.\nWe\u2019re also super excited to be working with Chel Wong on the game\u2019s original soundtrack. Chel has an amazing range of styles and really nailed the feeling that we\u2019re going for with this game. You can hear her work in the trailer above!\n\nHere\u2019s what Chel has to say about working on the Soundtrack:\n\u201cFor the soundtrack I have so many ideas I'm excited to work on! I plan on taking some influence from predecessors in the genre but also going to be putting my own spin on things. And as is my specialty, I can't wait to see what kind of adaptive layers I can put into this soundtrack to react to gameplay!\n\nSOUNDTRACK PREVIEW\nhere's a little preview of what Chel's cooking up for the soundtrack. This is the track for Lunar Canyon, along with the \"boss variant\" that will play at the end level boss fight.\n(Note: this is a work-in progress, Chel is still in the process of adding some sweet guitars!)\nHere are a few of the more unique Kickstarter-exclusive rewards we're offering!\n\nPUT YOURSELF IN THE GAME ($200 and above)\nYou'll send us a photo of yourself, your pet or anything that's age-appropriate, and we'll add it to an object in a special \"Easter egg\" level that players can access in the game itself!\nPut yourself in the secret level, rough concept\nADD YOUR FURRY FRIEND ($500 and above) \nYou'll send us a picture of your pet, or some artwork of your personal animal persona, and we'll add it to the game as a secret playable character, unlocked with a unique cheat code.\nYour furry friend in the game, rough concept\nCUSTOM SHOUT OUT $1000 and above)\nWe'll send you a survey and code up a special conversation with the characters in the game, who will give you a shout-out by name, activated by a special personal cheat code. We'll work with you to make it special!\nCustom shout-out, rough concept\nAaron San Filippo is a co-founder of Flippfly and the company\u2019s lead programmer. He\u2019s overseeing production and code, building new tools to support the design of the game, and coordinating the team. He also built the prototype for the game and helps out with design.\n\nSean Campbell is the designer and creative director. Sean helped Flippfly build Race The Sun\u2019s portal worlds, and has returned as the world creator and Whisker Squadron\u2019s creative director. He\u2019s also leading the efforts on the game\u2019s 3D art. \nAaron, Sean, Chel, Jin, Chris, and Zaire\n\nChel Wong is a seasoned composer with multiple game soundtracks to her name. Chel works in a variety of styles with an incredible range, and she\u2019s creating an awesome original soundtrack for Whisker Squadron.\n\nChris Atkins joined Flippfly recently as a programmer, and is helping flesh out Whisker Squadron\u2019s gameplay.\n\nJin Li is a concept artist and animator from Sydney, Australia. She created and drew all of the characters for Whisker Squadron and contributed concept design.\n\nZaire Lanier is a writer and narrative designer from the Midwestern US. She's creating a comic called The Bone Herder, and will be helping create the WS universe, characters, and in-game dialog.\nJune 2021: beta-level backers and above get early access to the beta on PC\nDecember 2021: game is content-complete and enters final phase of testing\nMay 2022: The game launches and all backers get a PC copy\nJuly 2022: All physical and digital rewards are delivered.\nMost of the funding for Whisker Squadron comes directly from Flippfly. We have been working on this game for about a year, and we are in a fortunate situation where Race The Sun and our other games are providing a steady income stream that\u2019s allowed us to work on the game. However, this Kickstarter will be essential for getting us over the finish line, and if we reach our stretch goals, will allow us to create an even better game, and guarantee an on-time delivery.\n\nWe\u2019ve invested a lot of Flippfly funds in Whisker Squadron already, supporting a small core team to build about 1/3rd of the game so far. We are on Kickstarter to raise funds to help finish the game and expand our team. This money will help us create an original soundtrack, add additional features, and finish the game sooner.\nYour support means the world to us! Our fans have always been central to Flippfly\u2019s success, and you are quite literally making this project possible. Thanks for coming along for the ride and being a part of our dream project!\n\n* Platforms:\nAt this time, we are planning for Steam, Epic Games Store on PC. We're also looking into PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch We will finalize these plans in the coming months and keep you updated! Backers will get a key on their choice of PC stores. \n\nWe are planning on supporting Windows, Mac, and Linux on PC.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRunning a videogame business always carries a certain amount of risk.

Depending on who you visit and when, you\u2019ll be able to develop a deeper relationship; plan a pizza party together, go to a concert\u2026 maybe even smooch! \nAs Samar\u2019s bonds with her friends grow deeper you\u2019ll unlock unique dialogue, spells, and items. You\u2019ll also be able to decorate Samar\u2019s bedroom using those trinkets and keepsakes, and each of these will provide different boons to your match-3 strategy, in addition to making Samar\u2019s room feel like home!\nSpirit Swap\u2019s world is inspired by the devs\u2019 love for their Lebanese roots, lo-fi and wired technology, and the 90\u2019s colorful aesthetic with a sprinkle of demonic vaporwave.\nSamar is a young witch working the spirit-swapping night shift in the eastern outskirts of Demashq. A recent spike in spirits crossing over from another dimension breaks the chill atmosphere of their night shift. With her trusty FamiliarZ by her side, she sets off into the city to find out what\u2019s happened. With the popular band, 5SOME, scheduled to kick off their big comeback tour in Demashq, Samar needs to work quickly before the city is overrun with stans and spirits alike....not to mention, they've got a pizza party to plan, and romance to pursue!\nSpirit Swap takes place in Demashq, a coastal city inspired by the Levantine cities of our own world, Damascus and Beirut.\nThe game follows Samar as they make their way from their home right outside the city, by the nearby forest, into the sprawling coastal city of Demashq where they meet their friends.\none of Samar's possible paths through Demashq\nIt reflects the Levant\u2019s general topography, nature, architecture and climate (middle eastern Mediterranean) as well as cultural references, vibrancy, and visual cues.\nA setting seldom explored in games outside the lens of orientalism, and almost never by people from that part of the world themselves.\nSpirit Swap\u2019s in-world magic draws on two main things: plants and community. Plants and nature are the source of all magic and humans when banded together act as amplifiers and users. The world is one parallel to ours where plant magic was democratized around the turn of the millenia instead of wireless communication. Magic and tech have become deeply intertwined.\nIn a world where magic is at everyone\u2019s fingertips, everyone needs a helping hand. For witches and demons alike, Familiars serve that purpose.\nIn the past, summoning a Familiar was a lengthy process.  Charting the constellations, preparing the ritual, and massive energy drain directly following the manifestation of an individual\u2019s soul became less popular in modern times.  Yet, the need for a Familiar\u2019s assistance and companionship did not.\nFamiliarZ Concept Art\nFamiliarZ were created to solve the problem; tech-assisted miniature devices that allow anyone to manifest a Familiar without the expense of magical energy required to sustain it.  With casings ranging from fashionable keychains to portable cassette players, witches and demons choose personalized ways to interact with their Familiar without having to reveal to the public any aspect of their inner selves.\nFamiliarZ Concept Art\nFor press interested in covering our Kickstarter, here are some screenshots and promo material to get you started!\nOur soundtrack and sound design are created by Meltycanon and eyelovebrandon.

Cover design not finalized.\nCoyote and Crow is a tabletop role playing game set in an alternate future of the Americas where colonization never occurred. Instead, advanced civilizations arose over hundreds of years after a massive climate disaster changed the history of the planet. You'll play as adventurers starting out in the city of Cahokia, a bustling, diverse metropolis along the Mississippi River. It's a world of science and spirituality where the future of technology and legends of the past will collide.\n\nThe game is created and led by a team of Native Americans representing more than a dozen tribes and we've built a game that both Natives and non-Natives will thrill to explore and build upon.\nMore than 700 years ago, a bright purple streak shot across the night sky. Over the coming weeks, the Earth fell into a deep winter, the seas raged and ash rained from the sky. The event became known as the Awis. As resources dwindled, winter became longer and summer shorter, people struggled to survive. Wars erupted, people starved, some fleeing their ancestral homes before creeping ice sheets. \nBut people survived. Tribes adapted. And in the wake, people began to notice a strange purple mark appearing on people, plants and animals alike. It became known as the Adahnehdi, the Gift, and many took it as a sign that the Great Spirit had not given up on them. \nEventually, the weather began to ease, the Earth began to heal, and new nations arose. New sciences and technologies, born out of necessity, led to a discovery about the Adahnehdi. It wasn't just a mark, it was a path to abilities and powers, beyond normal human limits. \nThe long walk home. Art by Jennifer Lange\nNow, 700 years after the world was brought to the brink, a new chapter has begun. Your characters enter a world that is healing but is no less dangerous. The ice sheets are retreating and the seas are calming, but what lay out beyond your borders? The treaties and alliances that made so much sense during the long winters are now eroding and old grudges between nations are not so easily forgotten. New technologies arise almost every day and the rate of change is frightening for some. And then there are the stories. Talk of spirits, monsters, beings of legend. For so many they were just tales to be told around the fire. But now there is talk that these legends may be far more literal than you may have previously believed. Has something awakened them?\nthe northern continent of Makasing.\nCoyote and Crow is an original role playing system built around the exclusive use of D12 dice. Outside of the core rule book, all you'll need to play the game is some pencil and paper and some twelve-sided dice. While there is some complexity to the game, we are striving to present a system that will allow players to refer to the rule book during play as little as possible, keeping most or all of the critical information on your character sheet.\nMock up of the front of a character sheet. Design not finalized.\nThe basic rule system is centered around collecting a Dice Pool, usually around 5-7 D12s and rolling them to determine either Success or Failure and degree of effect. For example \"8\" might be the number your Character needs to attempt to do something and every 8 or higher they rolled would be a Success. The more 8's, the more successful they are. \nWhile combat is a part of Coyote and Crow, the game is actually built around the idea of fighting being only one road to story resolution. The game encourages dialogue, building bridges and finding unique solutions to problems that are not always clearly defined by good and evil. \nYour Characters have Stats like Strength and Spirit and Skills like Investigation and Charm that are modified by their Stats. In addition, when you create your Character, you choose a Path. That Path determines both certain Stat bonuses you receive as well as which Abilities you have access to. Abilities are powers beyond normal human capability, but not at a level where characters would be comparable to superheroes. There are 15 Paths in the core rule book available. In addition, you'll choose an Archetype (Whisperer, Healer, Scout, among others) that will give you Stat and Skill bonuses and a general idea of your character's profession, but will not force your Character too deeply down a specific progression.\nThen you'll choose Gifts and Burdens. These allow you to give your Characters specific bonuses or drawbacks and will help you flesh them out in a way that is flavorful and realistic. It's important to note that the rulebook does not dictate whether something is a burden or a gift for a Player. For example, a Player might choose to give their Character a sister. That might be a Burden or a Gift (or both!) depending on how the Player wants their Character to see that relationship.\n\nSample pages from the equipment chapter. Layouts and content not finalized.\n\nThere are no experience points in Coyote and Crow. Instead, it is built on the Legends system. Your Character will have Short Term Goals, which will increase various numbers on your Character sheets or give them new Skills. But you and your group will also have Long Term Goals. When those are completed your legend will grow. You'll write a short story about your adventures, the kind that can be told around the fire for generations to come. These can change your Gifts and Burdens, give you access to new Abilities and more. As you complete more Long Term Goals, your Character's legend will precede them and your stories will spread.\n\nARCHETYPES\nThere are six Archetypes in the game, each acting as a starting point for Character development but not constricting their possibilities. Each Archetype has its own symbol. Here are a few of them.\nThe icons for Warrior, Tinkerer, and Scout (not finalized)\n\n\nPATHS\nIn addition to Archetypes, Players choose Paths for their Characters, which are permanent associations they make with an animal and help define what extra human Abilities they'll be able to choose from, among other effects. There are fifteen basic Paths in the core rulebook.\nThe Path of the Beaver, the Stag and the Spider\n(See our Update for more on this)\nWhile this game was created by a Native-led team, this game is for everyone. We've taken great care to craft a game that Natives and non-Natives alike will be able to engage in and find themselves immersed in. \nFor Natives, we've crafted both story and game mechanics that will allow you to integrate your own tribal customs into your play. For those who aren't Native, you'll have a wealth of options to choose from as well as clear guidelines for understanding the differences between this world and our real one. \nThe game is designed to be your first role playing game or your latest. The core rule book will walk players through every step of how to play Coyote and Crow, but also how to play role playing games in general, including advice on safety and inclusion as well as suggestions on where to find tools outside of the rule book to make your game both easier and more enjoyable.\nEveryone involved in Coyote and Crow is deeply passionate about our game and we felt that it was time for Indigenous folks to have a game that didn't see them as secondary, as adversaries, or intertwined with colonialism.\nCoyote and Crow is not set in a dystopia. The world went through a dark chapter, but the people of these nations rose to the challenge. There's good food and water, education and meaningful work for almost everyone in Makasing. \nBut this world isn't a utopia either. It's place that's growing, where old alliances are strained and past slights are not always forgotten. New technology is putting pressure on old traditions. And with the climate becoming milder, there is a whole world of unknowns out there. On top of all of that, there are rumors that some of the old stories about monsters and spirits might just be a little more real than some originally believed. This is a game where science and the unexplained live side by side and sometimes clash.\nThe Wanderer. Art by Kyle Charles.\n\nTHE CORE RULE BOOK\nWe are producing a beautiful 300+ page hardbound book, loaded with illustrations and containing all of the rules you'll need to play Coyote and Crow. Included in the book (and PDF) will be:\nDetailed history of this alternate world\nDescriptions of daily life and culture in Cahokia, the capital of the Free Lands\nRules for creating and advancing your characters, including 6 Archetypes, 15 Paths and 27 Abilities for a massive variety of options\nDescriptions and stats for mythical creatures, infamous spirits, shadowy organizations and dangerous cults that can challenge players endlessly\nA group of pre-generated characters if you want to jump right into playing the game\nA starter adventure, Encounter at Station 54, that can act as a stand alone adventure or as the start of a larger campaign\nSo much more!\nSHIPPING\nWe will be shipping only to the US and Canada during this Kickstarter. In addition, we will be subsidizing a portion of the shipping costs within the Kickstarter itself to help keep costs down. If you are not in the US or Canada, not to worry. We have already partnered with traditional hobby distribution and the game will be available through your local hobby partners shortly after Kickstarter fulfillment. \nYOUR PLEDGE\n Whisperer: $5  This pledge shows your support for the project and allows you to keep abreast of all the future news about Coyote and Crow. We'll also notify you when late pledges are available after the campaign.\n Tinkerer: $20 With this pledge you get everything the Whisperer gets, plus a full color PDF version of the physical game, including all of the art. This version will be released shortly after we have sent our files to the printer and you'll have access to it before the physical copies have been delivered.\n Warrior: $50 (plus shipping)All of the benefits of both the Whisperer and the Tinkerer plus you'll get one full color hard cover edition and access to all Stretch Goals.

You'll receive these at the same time as other Kickstarter backers, in advance of the general release.\n Seeker: $400 (plus shipping) (ALL GONE) For those that really want to support Coyote and Crow!

You'll also receive three high quality art prints of art used in the book (which ones, to be determined). This level is limited to 50 backers.\nIt still hungers. Art by Jeffrey Veregge\nWe have a diverse team of folks working on this game, most of whom are Native. Additionally, we are striving to bring in other marginalized voices whenever possible. Our team features people from across the LGBTQIA spectrum, including two spirit folks. It's not even a question that this game is political. If you have a problem with a game where there are no people of European descent represented, than this game is probably not for you. That said, we've truly built this game to be played by everyone. It might seem like a big leap, but don't worry, we're going to hold your hand the whole way through and you'll be so happy you stepped off the edge into this vibrant fresh world.\nOUR TEAM:\nCreator, Designer and Taker of Responsibility in the End: Connor Alexander (Cherokee Nation)\nNative Writers and Developers:\nDerek Pounds (Samish)\nWilliam McKay (Manitoba Metis Federation)\nWeyodi Oldbear (Numunu)\nAdditional Native Writers:\nNico Alberts (Cherokee Nation)\nRiana Elliott (Cherokee Nation)\nNative Graphic Artists:\nAl Harris (Lumbee)\nBarbara Schelling (Assiniboine)\nNative Artists:\nElijah Forbes ( Waganakising Odawak)\nJeffery Veregge (S'Klallam)\nKyle Charles (Whitefish Lake First Nation) \nBrian Roanhorse (Navajo)\nJillian Dolan (Metis/Cree)\nKeith Jim (Navajo)\nEmma Flowers (Crow)\nNative Playtest Leader and Consultant:\nShay Snow (Caddo and Plains Cree)\nNon-Native Team Members:\nJade Wesley (Editing)\nJennifer Lange (art)\nAmelie Hutt (art)\nJanice Sheen (cartography)\nChris Likins (website design)\nHeather O'Neill (Kickstarter Management)\n*We are continuing to add Native contributors throughout this project's development, so this list is not final.\n\nI'd also like to add that this is a very personal project for me. While it's the first project I've created, I've been working in the games industry for 7 years and I've been a role player since 1978. For a long time I've wanted to create a game that speaks to my Native heritage in a way that's hopeful and positive. I'm proud of the team I've assembled (and am still adding to) and I'm confident that we have the experience, talent and determination to not only complete this project and deliver, but to bring you a truly memorable role playing experience.   - Connor Alexander, creator\n$20,000   \u2714\ufe0fACHIEVED\nWe'll make every copy of Coyote and Crow with a gorgeous spot UV cover!\n$25,000  \u2714\ufe0fACHIEVED   \nWe'll include a massive 11\" x 17\" detailed and annotated map of the city of Cahokia in the core rule book. \n$55,000  \u2714\ufe0fACHIEVED   \nWe'll make a character name generator, true to the in game language, Kag Chahi, developed by William McKay.

A very kind person pointed out that our icon for the Warrior was almost identical to the modern icon used in Black Power messaging. This was entirely an error on my part. I used a placeholder mock-up instead of our final icon and we've since remedied that. You can see the actual icon for the Warrior in the current image on the Campaign page. The icon that was there previously was an internal use only illustration that was meant as a developmental reference and was never intended for print.  I apologize to anyone who was confused or concerned, and I truly hope there was no offense caused.  We have the deepest respect for our Black allies and our icon was always meant as a nod to them.

Nevertheless, you will still find pure indigenous tribes in every Latin American country who continue to practice their traditions; I'm not just referring to uncontacted Amazonian tribes! In Nicaragua alone, there are 7 indigenous groups recognized by the government with populations ranging from 2,000 to 200,000+. And even with groups like the Taino, who experienced a more complete genocide, and more than 80% of the Taino were killed, there still remain Taino people and historians who are practicing and preserving their heritage.

It requires strategic decision making as you move your players around the court and manage your team's energy with the unique JUICE system. Actions on the court lead to real-time dice battles to determine who comes out on top. \nApproachable mechanics for non-basketball and b-ball fans alike\nNon-stop action from start to finish in under 45 minutes per game\nCombines strategy and intensity in a highly thematic experience\nLots of replay value with 12 fierce ballers with unique skills \nAccessible game variant for players unable to roll dice in real-time \nHoop Godz is available to play free during the campaign on Tabletopia.com\nNote: Component count and component art is subject to change.\n Printable PDF Rulebook v0.8\nIn a standard game of HOOP GODZ, you win by being the first player to score 7 points.  Players will take turns, moving, passing, playing action cards, and facing off in real-time dice battle to see who rules the court. \nHere's an overview of the games main mechanics:\n Choose Your Ballers!  \nThe JUICE System\nUsing JUICE - You will need to take JUICE from the \"Available JUICE\" box and place it into the JUICE bar (filling the bar from left to right) for everything you want to do on the court. At the end of a turn, all JUICE in the bar moves down into the boxes below. \n G.O.A.T. Cards - Whenever you end your turn and place JUICE in the red box, you can draw one rule-breaking game-changing G.O.A.T. Card from the deck.\nRecovering JUICE - Ending your turn without placing any JUICE to the right of the \"Rest\" icon will let you recover 4 JUICE from the yellow box and move it to \"Available\".\nActions and Reactions\nBasic Actions - MOVE, PASS, and BOOST. These cost 1 JUICE each and can be done on your turn or as a reaction to your opponent playing an Action Card.\nAction Cards (Green) - Play these cards whenever you want to STEAL, CROSSOVER, SHOOT, or DUNK on your turn...but only if you have the JUICE!\nReaction Cards (Orange) - Play these cards in response to your opponent playing an Action Card. Whenever a Reaction Card is played it's time for a DICE BATTLE!\n\nDice Battles \n Once both players have played Action and Reaction Cards and collected the appropriate number of dice based on their Ballers and Boosts...\nREADY....SET....ROLL! \nThe first player to roll their dice and match the set of icons on the card they played is the winner of the dice battle and only their card goes into effect. \n...and that's all for the major mechanics in Hoop Godz!\nBlog Previews\nWhat's Eric Playing Blog Preview - \"If you\u2019re looking for a strategic sports game, you\u2019re a huge basketball fan, or you enjoy some real-time dice battles, Hoop Godz may end up being a slam dunk for you!

We are consulting with our manufacturer to determine the best possible options for the custom dice, standees/bases, and sets of gameplay tokens. We set our funding goal at a level where we can deliver fantastic components. This also means that we don't include component upgrade Stretch Goals, but there will be some Stretch Goals for additional components or add-ons once our original funding goal is met.\n\n\nMany of you have asked if we would have a BALLERIFIC 3D Mini Figure Add-On in Hoop Godz. I'll give you a HINT that it's may be possible via stretch goals. We have already been working with a 3D artist just in case. We are REALLY going to need your help to be able to manufacture high quality minis...so here's a little preview...\nSHARE THE HOOP GODZ CAMPAIGN ON SOCIAL TO HELP US REACH THIS GOAL!\nArtist: H. D. Harris (@Hdharris_irl)\nRap Godz Reprint!\nAs a part of this campaign you can also order a copy of Rap Godz, released by Board Game Brothas in January 2020 - Rating: 7.6/10 on BoardGameGeek\nRap Godz is a 2-4 player, 30-60 minute board game that puts you in the role of an up and coming hip-hop artist on your path to greatness.\nThe gameplay is a mix of strategy and storytelling as you play cards that represent events in your emcee's career and life. Your goal is to earn the most record sales plaques by the end of your third album. Along the way you will have to boost your swag, build up your street cred, and improve your rap skillz. Starting beef with players might put you on top but can also knock you out when you least expect it. \nPhoto Credit: Scott King\nPhoto Credit: Scott King\nPhoto Credit: Scott King\nShipping will be calculated and charged after the campaign is over.

I have Rap Godz and think the game is brilliant. That being said I too am finding the SG's to be somewhat lacking although a good solo mode would up the value of the game. What the game desperately needs is some new ballers (pfonstad on BGG recently shared some great ideas for some new ones). So ultimately I'm hoping that you give some serious consideration to having a stretch goal of additional ballers. As far as the solo mode goes you definitely have to reach out to Morgan Monrad Pederson (morganmdk on BGG). He as you may already know is one of the premium solo designers. He came up with a variant to the Solo Mode in Baseball Highlights 2045 - a GREAT game btw - that took it to another level. Good luck with the campaign and with getting Morgan on board.

You have allowed us to make The Wagadu Chronicles even better that we thought it ever could be.\nThank you SO MUCH!\nYou can continue following the development of the game and books through our website and our social media: twitter, instagram & youtube.\nAnd you are most welcome to join our lovely discord!\nSee you in-game <3 !\n We believe that role-playing isn't always just about about grinding and growing stats. It's the embodying of a role; the presence of a backstory and all of the quirks and details that define your unique character.\nMany of us have experienced old-school role-play around a table with pencils and a bunch of dice. We know how immersive it is to speak like our characters and to be surrounded by other players who are making decisions based on their characters profiles. Role-play truly submerses you in another world, more powerfully than any NPC  quest could.\nImagine a videogame where everyone around you is role-playing. The noble Emere with whom you are travelling does not want to desecrate any tombs and ignores the loot; the Swala hunter you just met chants a ritual prayer before every hunt and the Asiman merchant never attacks or kills anyone because she believes her goddess wants peace to rule in Wagadu.\n\n\n For the first time in gaming history we are building an online game 100% tailored to role-players, from lore to mechanics.\nThese are some of the community features that we are implementing to create this unique environment:\nContinuous releases of free lore material.\n In-character role-play as a default for all players when in Wagadu's servers.\nOff-world lobbies where players can get technical support or any role-playing tips on how to act out their character before returning to the actual game world.\nRewards for groups of players that engage in interesting and well thought role-playing.\nWe intend to keep the space safe from harassment and trolls who want to disrupt other people's story and the role-play environment - we are spending a lot of energy on this and will have a number of moderation tools that we and the community can use.\n We have already started building our community on Discord! We chat about the setting, role-playing games and even have a Wagadu role-play coffee-house channel <3 Join our Discord!\npre-alpha footage\n\n The tabletop RPG books of Wagadu are crucial to this project because they flesh out the lore in a way that a videogame can't. If you want to truly experience and understand role-play in Wagadu, you'll have to take a look at the lore that is in the books. If you decide to focus only on tabletop role-play, your input and user generated content will affect the development of the MMO.\nWagadu is an ecosystem of tabletop and videogame, which can be experienced in different ways depending on personal taste.\nExcerpts from our free teaser 5E lore book\nWagadu is a strange place where different types of people fall from another world and have to fight to adapt and survive. Behind the scenes a lot has been done to create this world. We believe that role-playing thrives when the setting is well fleshed out and interesting.\nThe approach taken to create this fantasy world was: \"What if Tolkien were black?\". Just as Tolkien did, a lot of time was spent researching the mythologies and traditions of people, but in this case across the African continent. The result is seven \"lineages\", which are similar to fantasy \"races\" but more nuanced, with overlapping cultures and more fluid identities.\n\nMany of the lore elements, including some crucial elements of the setting such as the conflict of lineages with slavery or the \"Dwen\" spirit-children, are inspired by diasporic experiences of black people both in the Americas and in Europe.\nTo make this fantasy world more authentic we have been in contact with experts such an Africa biologists for the various biomes and  African elders for village lore.\nWe are sharing a free 300 page guide to the world of Wagadu, that be can directly downloaded here: \n\nWagadu's role-play and immersion are so important for us that we built the MMORPG mechanics in tandem with the lore. In the Wagadu Chronicles, world-building and gameplay strengthen each other.\n We are building something that has never been seen before in any MMO, a special cinematic mode called \"Dialogue Mode\". This is a mode that can be triggered when two or more people chat with each other. It allows for close ups and the use of many animations (from emotions to little show-off spells) you can basically create your own little live show with friends or strangers as you explore and role-play your character's story.\npre-alpha footage\n The 5E setting adapts the usual class system to Wagadu, the MMO takes a freer approach.  You have skill \"presets\" that look like traditional \"classes\" but you can freely break away from that and build your own warrior-oracle or farmer-chef, nothing stops you.\nYour character is made up of skills that go from 1 (beginner) to 5 (master), every level unlocks more advanced uses of that skill.\nThere are dozens of skills to choose from, we have many of them nailed down already but we will be looking for feedback (especially from our backers) on what additional skills to add during alpha and beta. Some examples from the current skill set are cartography, divination, archery and animal husbandry.\nEvery day, every player receives a free bundle of experience points (called \"Memories\") to invest in skills. No grind required, so you're not penalised if you decide to become a travelling merchant, a coffee-brewer or a tailor: you'll level up just like your mercenary friend.\nA special feature of The Wagadu Chronicles are \"ancestral blessings\". Throughout Wagadu, Ancestors leave skills for players to pick them up, these skills last from a few minutes to an hour and unlock some random power anywhere in the skill tree (and sometimes even completely unique powers that belong to NPC Ancestors). So your Daa'ima bodyguard character may well be able to breathe underwater for an hour or to heal everyone for 15 minutes!\npre-alpha footage\n Just as in other sandbox MMOs, we will leave the economy in the hands of the players. If there are only a few Fire Asimans in the game who can craft fire potions, these will become rare and expensive and people will have to travel more to find where to buy them.\nMost items in the game can only be crafted by other players, loot and NPCs will provide only a few basics.\nMany items, from pots to clothes, to weapons, can be customized by in-game editors if you have the right skills. No two robes are the same in The Wagadu Chronicles! You can sign your creations and even become a famous in-game designer (and ask higher prices). \nAdditionally, every item can be lost or stolen when you get slain - be careful!\n\n\n\n Surviving Wagadu requires interaction with Spirits and Ancestors of all types. Obtaining wood in Wagadu for instance, usually requires interaction with a Tree Spirit. You can convince it to give you some wood by making the right offering but also by behaving in ways the Spirit likes: if in the last few days you have planted and watered seeds in the farm, the Tree Spirit might be more generous to you. If instead you are holding an axe, the outcome might even be a battle. Navigating Spirit requests is made even trickier by the fact that different resource Spirits have conflicting requests and things that they love/hate.\nIn Wagadu, NPCs remember what you do and act accordingly. Your actions matter.\nAnother little peculiarity of The Wagadu Chronicles is that your character has a couple of \"hidden background\" traits: these are features that you inherited from an ancestor (such as descending from an Elephant-Spirit) and that are hiddenly assigned randomly at character creation. Spirits might react upon them, and discovering your hidden backgrounds can be an exciting role-play story and create unexpected bounds with other players.\npre-alpha footage\n\nTotems are central to every player's game, since they:\nact as spawn point.\nprovide healing & safety.\nbestow perks (e.g. farming bonus).\nallow to place player housing.\n  Groups of players can turn an unclaimed  wilderness Totem into a Village Totem by giving it recurrent offerings. This allows players to place housing around it. The type of offerings the Totem asks for varies based on its personality: one might request  30 calves to be born, another Totem might just ask for money.\nThe Totem requests vary slightly every week and a Totem's personality affects the village's players' gameplay and goals.\nPlayers can make offerings to additional wilderness Totems to add them to their \"Totem Pantheon\" and get their perks. When two different villages compete for the same Totem, a \"Spiritual Challenge\" ensues in which the highest bidder wins.\nSheer strength does not always mean victory. A Totem might request that the whole village never goes hunting, so that Lionblood village might give it a pass and let it be claimed by the peaceful clan of farming players that live in the next island.\n\n The Music of Wagadu is heavily inspired by a combination of African traditional instruments and with western RPG tunes. We aren't just building a refreshingly new soundtrack, we are also creating new associations based on African traditions, such as playing Ghana's bamboo-flute funeral dirge for death-related gameplay and Mali's Dogon bull-roarer for spiritual and ancestral summoning.\n We are collaborating with established traditional Ghanaian musicians such as Dela Botri and professors of the Department of Music of the University of Accra in order to make Wagadu sound truly authentic.\nFor the voiced parts of the game, we will be collaborating with black voice-actors, such as the iconic, Abubakar Salim (\"Bayek\" in Assassin's creed Origins) whose amazing voice features in our Kickstarter trailer.\nRecording sessions at Kay Boni's Cafe Abajo in Accra, Ghana\n\nTwin Drums is made up of a team of established game developers. We have worked for some of the biggest franchises and gaming companies out there. We have experience of working on different platforms and we are bringing all of these different perspectives into our game development. And yes, we are half black and a third queer: that\u2019s our secret super-power.\nTo make sure that The Wagadu Chronicles gets all the support it needs, we have partnered with League of Legends developer Riot Games - they have been amazing with us and we are very excited about this collaboration.\n\n We have some funding and support from a big developer. The Wagadu Chronicles is happening. The reason why we are here is because your support can help us improve the game by increasing our development budget and by joining us in this development journey with your feedback and participation.\nBeing able to see how many of you care about role-playing and afrofantasy and getting your support will help us make The Wagadu Chronicles the best game that it can possibly be!\n Please note that the price in USD is an approximation based on the original price in Euros since Twin Drums is based in Europe. Prices in USD may vary depending on the USD to EUR exchange rate.\nBear in mind that shipping costs have not been included in the pledges and will have to be paid subsequently. \nWe are currently collecting data and negotiating with our suppliers in order to get the best deal for most countries and we will be able to provide exact shipping charges closer to shipment!\nSome pledges provide multiple versions of  in-game items as a rewards. This is very special because all items in Wagadu can normally be lost or stolen at death (\"full loot\") but these backer reward items are \"bound to your soul\", they cannot be looted. Since we will not be producing them anymore by game release, their value will constantly increase and they will become very rare, expensive and recognisable in the game. It's your choice if to keep them, sell them or gift them to your closest friend.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe main risk is that we are a small team making a relatively big game.

Many are scared, many refuse to back down, and many have no clue what will come next. Hope is like a candlelight striving to stay bright among all of the darkness. In Cede, are you this candlelight fighting a famine similar to the global impact of a pandemic as well as a worldwide power imbalance among billions of lifeforms. There are ways of the world that are holding us back from experiencing ultimate glory, freedom, and love. We are not just physical beings, we are spiritual and mental beings as well. So let's go beyond surface level into the soul and spirit to understand how we must move on the surface. Join the movement of our project game Cede and tell the world how we can unlock from whats holding us back and put actions into place with these words. \n ADD ONS:\nYou can add rewards to your current tier. Just change your pledge amount to add the additional amount from your add-on(s) and we will see this addition along with a note from you during surveys.\n Combat Farming - upon defeating a lifeform will transform them into environment changers (plants) that assist you through combat in various ways. Dropping health, increasing stats, help fighting against opposing lifeforms, and more. The power of your squad is primarily based off how many plants you have grown. \n Cede is a 3D action packed combat farming game that focuses heavily on combat enhanced by changing the environment around you. The more you grow the stronger your squad becomes. \n 4 Player Co-op Campaign - When we originally started Cede, we only planned for a single player experience. We took Cede to many conventions like PAX, DreamHack, and GDC. Many of our fans deeply expressed their desire for a cooperative experience. We grew up on 4 Co-op games which brought us together for many great experiences. Cede will have a 4 player Co-op campaign. One player will play with Seph while the remaining three players will choose different characters to join the venture. \n  Powerful story and Replayability - Every playthrough of Cede will provide a unique experience through how you grow environment changers in hundreds of combat scenarios. In just one area you may have grown a bunch of trees based on random large lifeforms who will enter the environment versus another player who entered the same area and grown small flowers from random small lifeforms.  The story is intertwined with what and how you are growing around the world. \n Swarm combat = More Growth + More Loot - Yep! Combat will be crazy hectic with swarms of opposing lifeforms attempting to overthrow you and accomplish their goals. This means upon defeating them more beautiful plant life will fill the environment and these plants will drop loot for you to take back to your hub farm. \n Hub Farm - Bring back loot you've found while combat farming in different areas to your own personal hub farm to grow and harvest crops. Use these crops to get stronger and build custom loadouts. Cede will also have an exchange ecosystem between players.\nWe are updating Seph design to the coolness you see above. The old design we felt did not translate well in 3D, primarily his legs were really short. We extended his legs and giving him some cool clothes so that he's not nakey lol. \nSeph, Lil Boi's, and other unannounced playable characters will all have a full on set of abilities/skills for a more dynamic action rpg combat style. These abilities will still effect environment changers in various ways. \nThe planet's state before the chaotic conflict and after.\nSeph and Lil Bush in the wilderness\nEnvironment changer concepts\nOur game won't be a Pay to Win type of game, I've been asked that by some of you. I will clarify these items with you all on our youtube channel and email list. \nInitial Release\nCede will release on windows first. We haven't finalized which platform we will release on (steam, itch, epic, website), but we will keep you all updated on through the campaign. Just know that whatever we move forward with, it will be compatible with the ecosystems we are pushing for while ensuring a smooth gaming experience. We have plans for console release in the future after our windows release. \nCheckout some of our contributors and we are currently looking for more talent to join our amazing squad. \n\nDespite not reaching the funding goal in our last kickstarter campaign we gained something really powerful, a connection with many of you. It really boosted our morale to see new people who believed in Cede. Kickstarter is a platform which helps us make the connection with you and reach new souls. I firmly believe in connecting with the soul and spirit first then the funding and resources will come along. We are on a mission and want to invite those who align with that mission to join our family.  Together we shall win and shift energy to bring balance in areas of need. \nLet me quote a point from our last campaign at the bottom of the page \"Again we DO NOT want to go to a publisher for the capital to finish this game. If we reach the initial funding goal and nothing more, then we will have to resort to additional funding from a publisher or investor to finish. Our game is currently in the prototype phase and $40K would get our game to a fully fleshed out alpha to secure a publisher. \" Despite not reaching the funding goal in our last campaign, I did not let that stop us from creating the a demo to pitch to publishers. At this point I feel like we have nothing to prove that we have the capacity to make an amazing game based on what we've been able to pull off with little to no money. We have a demo and many of you have played it at PAX, GDC, and other events. The demo just doesn't do the final vision justice, but know that we have one.

We will post an update when we select new dates.\nGOAL UNLOCKED: Join us for our Developer Retrospective Livestream (Before/After, Alpha to Release). (Date postponed, TBA)\n GOAL UNLOCKED: Join us for our We should talk. Seminar by Carol & Jordan. (Date postponed, TBA)\nIt's not what you say, it's how you say it. We should talk is a short-form narrative game that will make you think carefully about the words you choose, coming Summer 2020 to Windows, Mac, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch. \nIn We should talk, you'll use the sentence spinner to piece together modular sentences in response to the in-game characters. Choose your words carefully to express yourself as you discuss ongoing problems about life and romance with Sam, your in-game partner, over text messages, while also chatting with friends and strangers at your favorite local bar.\nThe combination of words you choose impacts the conversations you have, how genuinely you can connect with your partner, and whether your relationship can survive the night. It's up to you how to respond\u2014depending on how you communicate, you'll see one of 9 possible endings. \nPersonalized Choices: Using the sentence spinner, make choices that connect with you. Countless options abound\u2014be yourself, or role play someone you never thought you could be.\nUnique Characters: Your night at the bar is more interesting thanks to all the unique people you encounter. Find your healthy balance between chatting with your friends and keeping up with the texts from your partner at home. \nDifferent Paths: Your choices drastically affect the way folks respond to you, leading to one of many different paths in each conversation. Will you be accommodating, flirty, stand-offish, or somewhere in-between?\nMultiple endings: Play again and again to find all 9 possible endings. Conclusions aren't based on a specific path or route the way many traditional narrative games branch, but instead the endings are based on the tone your responses express throughout the game. What do your relationships look like at the end of the night?\nRealistic conversations: Experience the emotions that come with real conversations, whether it\u2019s the the joy that comes with teasing a friend, the anxiety that comes with a heavy text message, or the frustration of navigating a touchy conversation with a creep. Express yourself as clearly as you can and hope that your conversational partner understands, though there's always a risk they might interpret your words differently than you intended.\nThe development of We should talk is close to completion, so we're turning to Kickstarter to help our launch be as strong as possible. Our team hoped to present We should talk at a number of global events this spring and summer as we near the game's release, but the pandemic threw a wrench in our plans. We're raising money to help us pay for marketing and promotional efforts post-launch so that we can try to reach more people through digital media. We know this project is important and deserves to be seen by folks who would benefit from its message, and we feel that Kickstarter is the best way to help us make that happen. We plan to use the money we raise to help us advertise through social media, sponsorship, and other available marketing avenues. \nFrancesca, Carol, Jordan & Nobonita\nWe should talk was created by Nobonita Bhowmik, Francesca Carletto-Leon, Jordan Jones-Brewster, Carol Mertz, Kat Aguiar, and Jack Schlesinger\u2014six developers that met as MFA students at the NYU Game Center. Our team came together with the goal of creating a game that challenges traditional transactional romance in games, and collaborated to push relationship-building games forward by expanding the realm of player choice. While the game started with all of us together in Brooklyn, NY, our team members now span as far globally as Bangladesh, Japan, St. Louis, MO, and Madison, WI.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe development of We should talk is finished!

That said, there are very few risks at this point in development, other than a potential delay in our release due to COVID-19 and other economic and industry roadblocks.\n\nWe are offering some Kickstarter tiers that allow Backers to contribute content to the game, and do know that can often be a source of delay. We won't allow backer-written content and credits to delay us unnecessarily, and plan to enforce strict deadlines on reward surveys so that we can get credits and content in the Steam version of the game in time for our anticipated summer launch.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 7 or more", "title": "The Game", "descp": "Get a Steam key to download the digital game\nINCLUDES:\nSteam Key", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jul 2020"}], "stat": ["486 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 25 or more", "title": "Pin, Digital Art, & Credit", "descp": "Get the credit you deserve!

Read more here!\nOnsen Master is a single-player hot spring customer management game coming to PC, Mac, Linux and now console, late 2020. Players must revitalize various onsens across the fantasy island of Izajima! Create ingredients to match the various customer ailments, reconnect the communities that surround the onsens and discover the supernatural world that they've long since been disconnected from.\nShort and sweet single-player story across 6 hot spring levels\nVisual novel style dialogue with a cute anime aesthetic \nArcade mode to skip the story and dive right in\nAn original soundtrack\nInspired Hayao Miyazaki's Spirited Away and great game titles like Overcooked and Diner Dash, Onsen Master matches a colorful fantasy world with frantic customer and hot spring management. \nAs Mu, players will travel to various hot springs across Izajima to manage onsens populated by unique customers and Japanese spirits, called yokai. As patrons queue within the onsen, your goal is to create ingredients that will solve a variety of ailments within the time limit. \nOnsen Master consists of three main tasks: Greet the customer, Mix your ingredients and Heal their ailments! \nCustomers will queue at the entrance of each onsen and wait for you to guide them to a bath. Be sure to assist them quickly, as each customer has a timer and depending on your speed of service you can receive a nice chunk of change to influence your final score, but if the timer runs out they will leave the onsen!\nOnce you've sorted your customer, it's time to select an ingredient that matches their needs and head to the mixing station! There you will turn your ingredient into its final solution and dump it into the customer's bath to heal them. \nBut that's not all you'll be managing; unruly customers and Japanese spirits called \"yokai\" have come to the onsen as well and with them they bring unique ailments and behaviors to throw you off of your routine. Keep a keen eye for these characters and help them efficiently, or else they may cause quite the ruckus! \n Onsen Master is a story about healing, set in fantasy feudal Japan. As Mu, you've been tasked with filling the shoes of your missing sensei, the great \"Onsen Master\". Since their disappearance, onsens across the island of Izajima as well as the harmony between its peoples has fallen into shambles. It is now up to you to restore the balance and uncover what happened to the previous master. \nThe towns in Onsen Master are home to a variety of people with unique moods and behaviors. While most customers are pretty easy going, others will need special attention as they might cut in line or roughhouse with other patrons!\nThe people of Izajima aren't the only ones interested in attending the local hot springs. Yokai (Japanese spirits) are also about and will be making their way into the various onsen. They are sure to bring with them their unique habits like licking customers, creating slippery puddle, and chasing Mu!\nOnsen Master takes place on the island of Izajima. Apart from restoring your own onsen, you'll visit the islands varied locations and the inhabitants that reside within them.\nDon't let the cozy simplicity of Nakatsukuni Onsen from the prototype fool you! Izajima Island's other onsens each come with a variety of unique challenges for prospective Onsen Master's to overcome! From Umiguchi's bustling restaurant patrons stumbling directly into the nearest bath to Furuki's living tree picking up and moving baths, the challenges will be sure to provide a surprising variety!\nWant to know more?

We have been supporting Onsen Master with much smaller wallets and now turn to Kickstarter in hopes to build a community interested in supporting our development and eventual launch. We also hope of launching Onsen Master to console and bringing local multiplayer, but we need your help!\nDerrick Fields (@wakingoni) is the lead designer, 3D artist, and general \"many job doer\" on Onsen Master. He loves to create art derived from African American and Japanese media and culture. One can usually find him spending time with his family or playing a great deal of Sea of Thieves. \nTim Robinson (@lightshaper_) is the other lead designer, producer, project manager, and wearer of an indeterminate amount of development hats. Who knows what he\u2019s actually like beneath all of those hats. He can usually be found near coffee and some say that if he strays too far from it that he will age instantly into dust.\nLeo Riveron (@leolicos) leads all of programming and technology on Onsen Master.  He is a Game Developer by day, cosplayer and ninja warrior by night, and loves to make music in his free time.  Out in the wild, he can usually be found climbing on something he probably shouldn't.\nSarah Gavagan (@gavagan_sarah) works on character and level concepts for Onsen Master. Her work plays with nature and mythology, and draws a lot of inspiration from printmaking and the natural world. If you don't run into her making sushi part-time at her local izakaya, she's escaped yet again to volunteer on farms catching bees, picking weeds and following cats she finds on the street. \nDorrell Ettienne (@dorrellettienne) is the Composer for Onsen Master but could be better referred to as a sound wizard who creates imaginative music for media. He maintains a large interest in Japanese culture and the arts.\nWe love what we have created for Onsen Master so far and hope that we can go on to develop more. All of the team members have been contributing to this project part-time, with any availability made from their jobs and personal lives. Any expenses revolving this project has been paid for out of pocket, so developing a supportive community through Kickstarter would enable us to deliver a game directly to an audience that is as passionate as we are. \nIn short, a couple friendly devs have told us of their even friendlier audiences and we hope Onsen Master can be apart of that. Thanks!\nLet's be real, completing a game on $10k is a tight budget. That is why we feel that scaling down on our first game  is an honest approach to ensuring that we are not biting off more than we can chew and still be able to provide our audience with a fun experience. We have a few stretch goals, but created them in a way that we feel keeps us right on target for our release of late Q4 2020. Should we greatly exceed those goals, it is very important to us to not expand our scope any larger for our own mental health and you getting exactly the game you came for.

Each episode is written by a different author as they give their own take on the bizarre and bloody landscape and the people who live there, from the surreal bloodswamps of the Fleshlands, to the ghostlands of Tornado Valley, to the sentient hateful forests of the Pacific Northeast.\nYou play as Sam, Cass, Brad, and Lianna, four antifascist mech pilots on the move. After a disastrous event which cost the lives of thousands, your small group is hurled directly into the middle of a massive conspiracy where even the sky isn't the limit. \nWith the clock ticking before the next disaster, you must band together and fight, sweet-talk, and jam your way across the treacherous Rozarx, piloting mechs, killing fascists, and hunting cryptids to pull off the greatest heist of all time.\nWe're gonna steal the motherfucking sun.\nThe combat in Meatpunks is kinetic, gnarly, and bloody. In each combat scenario, you play as one of the four main characters, each with their own specific abilities, moves, and animations, as you scratch, juke, and teleport through endless hordes of fascists.\nAdditionally, we're implementing a new HEART CHANGE system -- when a character has an especially big moment of growth in the story, it comes with a completely new move set for the combat sections! A character who's weak now may have a breakthrough that changes them to the strongest character in the game, or a strong character could become weak.\nSAMAEL GODKILLER (he/him): An absolute sweetheart hiding a terrible secret, Sam used to be a farmer before being run out of town and finding solace in the Meatpunks. He tries his best to appear normal to not worry his friends, but if you look closely... He has two shadows.\n\nCASSANDRA TRANG (they/them): The group's reluctant leader, Cass puts most of their effort into just trying to get through the day. At night, eerily prescient nightmares give them a glimpse of the horrible future. They're almost certain their guidance has gotten good people killed. \n\nBRADLEY ULTRABRAD (he/him): Always quick with a joke or an inscrutable reference, Brad is the group's resident mech engineer. He's got a heart made of meat, and he's always willing to talk about his newest mech designs! He's been a little quiet lately, though... I wonder what's up with that.\n\nLIANNA CARNAGE (she/her): Lianna made her first kill when she was twelve, and has caused a lot of damage to a lot of bad people since. She's pretty cheerful about it, too. Now that she's back in her home state, though, it looks like that first kill is coming back to haunt her.\n\nTHE TRUCKER (she/her): A new friend and potential tagalong for the group, The Trucker is looking to make one last delivery. She's quick with sarcasm and quicker with a right hook. She and Lianna seem to be getting along suspiciously well...\n\nTH\u2591 \u2591\u2591\u2591 \u2591\u2591 \u2591\u2591\u2591 \u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591 (\u2591E/\u2591\u2591\u2591) \u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591 \u2591\u2591\u2591 \u2591\u2591 \u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591 \u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591 \u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591 \u2591\u2591\u2591 \u2591\u2591\u2591 \u2591\u2591\u2591 \u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591 \u2591\u2591\u2591 \u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591  \u2591\u2591 \u2591\u2591\u2591 \u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591 \u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591 \u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591 \u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591 \u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591 \u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591 \u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591 \u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591 \u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591 \u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591 E\u2591\u2591 N\u2591 \u2591\u2591\u2591D \u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591 \u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591 \u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591 \u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591 \u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591 \u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591 \u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591 \u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591 \u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591 \u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591 \u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591 \u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591 \u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591 \u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591 \u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591 \u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591 \u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591 \u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591 \u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591 \u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591 \u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591 \u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591 C\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591O\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591 M\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591E \u2591S \u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\n\nHeather Flowers (she/her) - Designer, writer, producer \nHeather is an independent developer with dozens of games under her belt.

Notably, she was the designer for the colorful MEATPUNKS postcards, as you can see below! You can find her Twitter here, and her website here.\nEXTREME MEATPUNKS FOREVER: Bound By Ash is currently in a pre-alpha state. Think of it as a game with all of its bones but none of the meat yet: all the mechanics are implemented, all the aesthetic decisions have been made, all the story's been outlined. \nThe primary thing we're missing is content, the meat to put on those bones. On the occasion that we succeed with this Kickstarter, we will spend the next year writing dialog, composing music, drawing character art, designing levels, and all the other little things that make a game like this shine. \nIn order to create that content, we need funding. Funding through Kickstarter allows us to make this dream game, without forcing us to compromise our vision for publishers. MEATPUNKS is loudly queer, proudly antifascist, and strongly anti-authoritarian. With your help, we can keep it that way, while continuing the story in a new and bold direction.\nHere's a rough estimate of where your money will be going, by percentage! The reason we call it \"rough\" is because certain parts can only be estimated at present; it's impossible for us to know how many rewards we'll be filling until y'all give us that number!\nStill, we're very confident we'll be able to complete the game with this budget.\nFor your convenience, here's a table of every reward tier, and what you get along with each tier!\nLet's talk a little more about those physical rewards, since we're personally VERY excited about them!\nAt the $40 level, in addition to previous rewards, you get a sick MEATPUNKS patch! Here's the design for it:\nAt the $50 level, in addition to previous rewards, you get a set of postcards of different locations in the world of EXTREME MEATPUNKS FOREVER!\nAt the $75 level, you get the 16-page minicomic EXTREME MEATPUNKS FOREVER: GHOSTS. Here's a preview page to pique your interest!\nAt the $100 level, you get a signed postcard of your choice from the previous set...\nAnd at the $150 level, you get a signed cassette tape containing the original soundtracks to EXTREME MEATPUNKS FOREVER: Powered By Blood AND EXTREME MEATPUNKS FOREVER: Bound By Ash! It's a two-for-one special! Here's a sneak peek at the concept art for it:\nThen, we move on to the custom reward tiers!\nAt the $500 level, you get a Meatpunks-style character portrait based on yourself, a loved one, or an original character!\nAt the $1000 level, you get your very own MEATPUNKS-style custom fight theme in any genre of your choice (within reason)! The song will be 1.5 minutes long, you will get one round of revisions, and the composer will retain the right to distribute the final song.\nBeyond that point, we have two tiers for people who want to give us several thousand dollars, which is kinda buck wild but we sure aren't disputing the idea.\nAt the $3,000 tier, we will work with you to design a character to be put in the game! This character will show up, have one or two lines, and then instantly die. Maybe a chandelier will fall on them. We'll work with you to give them a fitting death!\nAnd finally, at the $10,000 tier, we will allow your in-game character to actually live throughout the main story! Many writers would say that inserting a complete unknown into an already-plotted story is a terrible idea, but we here are agents of chaos who don't know the meaning of fear.\nEXTREME MEATPUNKS FOREVER: Bound By Ash is a hugely personal project, and by supporting it you help us bring it to life. For supporting the project, or even sharing it, let us say from the bottom of our hearts: thank you so, so much.\n<3", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nEXTREME MEATPUNKS FOREVER: Bound By Ash is a game with a small, dedicated team. We fully plan on fulfilling our promise to the community and delivering a game experience that lives up to your expectations, but the nature of independent game development is sometimes chaotic, with unexpected pitfalls. With such a small team, were something bad to happen to one of the members, it could easily delay the release.\n\nThat said, one of the benefits of this being a sequel is that we've basically already made a game exactly like this, and we already know all of the challenges ahead of us. Additionally, much of the game's framework already exists from the first season, and while we plan on improving on nearly every aspect of the original game, doing so with an established framework is much easier and less risky.\n\nEach person on the team is among the best at what they do, and the worst that could happen to the project (outside a serious emergency) is the project being delayed by a few months. We're a hardy team, and we are confident we will bring the game to completion in a timely manner.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Mech Pilot", "descp": "YOUR NAME IN CREDITS\nThank you for pledging!

THE NEW YORKER called it \"the hottest publication at recent comic conventions.\" Jeet Heer (THE NEW REPUBLIC) writes that it's \"the most mind-boggling comics artifact since the early issues of Acme Novelty Library.\" It's currently nominated for a 2019 Eisner Award, the highest prize in the American comics industry.\n Here's a peek inside:\nPLAY\n\nNow we're back with LAAB #4: THIS WAS YOUR LIFE! (LAAB numbering is non-sequential.) \nIt's even bigger and bolder, and full to the broadsheet brim with brilliant contributors, astonishing artwork and original thinking. \nRon has assembled a remarkable team of audacious thinkers, writers, artists, musicians, theorists, cartoonists and genre-defiers to mine this rich territory. LAAB is a long-overdue soapbox, stage, megaphone, bullpen, and launching pad \u2013 all in a mass-produced, widely accessible newspaper format that everyone can enjoy. \nAnd we need your help to make it happen.\nImage by Richie Pope\nIn our new issue, we confront mortality itself. LAAB #4: THIS WAS YOUR LIFE concerns themes of death and environmental devastation, horror, hauntology, necropolitics, and the anthropocene. We ask what it means to die, and what it means to live -- and what might have to die for a future to be born.\nImage by Hellen Jo\nLAAB #4: THIS IS YOUR LIFE is a big 48 page 16x21\" broadsheet newspaper printed on bright white heavy 50# paper stock. It's a high end art newspaper with top production values and gorgeously printed images.\nLAAB #4 features:\nComics by an absolute murderer's row of contributors, including Emily Carroll, Ben Passmore, Hellen Jo, Jonathan Djob Nkondo, Nishat Akhtar, Josiah Files, Freddie  Carrasco, Richie Pope, Tanna Tucker, Gymah Gariba, and more.\nAn interview with Sandy & John Carpenter on the meaning of horror and the arc of history.\nA piece by Sarah Jaffe exploring the connection between the ALIEN franchise and reproductive freedom\nAn original twelve-page comic from Ronald Wimberly\nKim Jooha on ugly comics\nElizabeth Young on Frankenstein's monster as a metaphor for Blackness\nA Michael Horse spread on the battle over the waters at Standing Rock\nHorrorscopes! by Nicole Hamilton. What's your monster?\n...and much, much more.\nThis magazine is providing a paying forum for a lot of deep-dive, longform writing, artwork, thinking and discussion by some of the most brilliant and singular writers, artists and storytellers working today. We believe in this ongoing mission and experiment-in-progress. Every backer is our collaborator in the construction of what we hope will be sustainable venue for the kinds of art and prose that can't be found anywhere else.\nImage by Sloane Leong\n Here are some excerpts from the comics we've already commissioned for LAAB #4:\nExcerpt by Yvan Alagbe\nExcerpt by Freddie Carrasco\nExcerpt by Sloane Leong\nExcerpt by Hellen Jo\nExcerpt by Emily Carroll\nWe recognize that LAAB is not a low-cost publication, and that to have $20 to spend on a small press publication is a luxury. In the interest of making a magazine that's accessible to everyone, for every two copies sold via this campaign we will donate one additional copy to a library, public school, prison, or streetcorner free-newspaper box where it will be accessible at no cost.\nWe donated over 500 copies of LAAB #0 to many organizations and institutions, including Books Through Bars, The Austin Justice Coalition and The A-Space. We hope to double that number with LAAB #4.\nWe also have a sliding scale on digital editions. If you can't afford the $7 that we're charging for the PDF, simply message us, and we'll make sure to send you a copy for a price of your choosing, or for free. \nImage by Freddie Carrasco\nWe have a number of pieces of original art for sale through this campaign.

Included!*\n  *ALL tiers at $50 and above, will receive the fully upgraded books! No extra charge!*\nSwordsfall isn't just a story, it's a world. It's a dive into pre-colonial Africa for all the rich lore you've never heard of. It's an exploration into a world where the majority of the faces are dark, yet isn't constrained to one corner. It's a world where women hold power equal to men and the merit of ones soul is what propels them through life. It's a world where spirits aren't to be feared, they are to be embraced. In a time where we know that representation matters, this project is an effort to add to that spirit in the way I know best. Narrative fiction in the nerdiest of flavors. \nSwordsfall is made up of three key parts; World Anvil, Tabletop RPG and Stories/Novels. Each of them telling a different part in the lore that is the world of Tikor. This Setting and Artbook is part of that synergy and the first step toward realizing the Tabletop RPG.\n For the Full Plan - Check out the Swordsfall Patreon\n Read our Feature in Kotaku!\nFinal Concept Piece for the Minos - Art by T'umo Mere\nThe Story So Far...\nIn the beginning... Tikor is a world where deities and spirits are as real as the nature that surrounds them. Since the earliest writings of mankind, the gods have been there with them. They are a vital part of the makeup of human societies across the globe. This is in a way to be expected. Humans were in fact, created by the gods. Various great deities created cultures of their design and ethos. As time marched forward, these various cultures and groups co-existed. Sometimes contentiously, sometimes harmoniously, but always striving to co-exist. \nConcept Art for the Dihoma - Artwork by Tumo Mere\n\nHistory, however, would change over the course of a tragic day and its horrific night. Mime, the Garuda deity of Wisdom, is assassinated at the hands of an alleged Vinyatian assassin. Mortal hands had never slain a deity. As tensions between the rival nations of Garuda and Vinyata soared under a long Tikor night, a bloody battle erupted between the two sides. A truce was called once the truth was revealed, but not before irreversible damage to both sides was done. \nDespite the armistice between bitter enemies, the wounds of that day will forever linger. The world heaves as the one constant, the gods themselves, waver and a new struggle begins.\nSwordsfall Logo Designed by Taylor Ruddle\nTHE YEAR 10 A.R\nAs the world still recovers, ten years after the bloody events that ended the Era, its fallout begins to appear. Rumors begin to give rise around the world of the arrival of a new kind of weapon. Instruments capable of killing gods, Grim Arms. Could this be related to the unsolved assassination of Mime? \nIn Garuda, a power struggle is in full effect as the current ruler of The Divine Order of the Phoenix, Amma Zencora, vies to hold onto his ill-gotten throne. How far will the ruler go to defend the throne he so desperately wants to hold on to? \nKevin Hou has allowed his art be used in Swordsfall\nVinyata is adjusting to a world with one less major city and cultural hub. The Eastern Node having been destroyed during the bloody war at the End of the Era. An unpleasant surprise emerges as they rebuild and a rash of malevolent spirits now roam the region. The souls of those lost 10 years still attached to the mortal plane, hungry for vengeance and retribution.\nHawklore's neutrality during The Longest Night has finally paid dividends. Literally. The God King, Hawken, basks in the increasing wealth of his nation. On the outside, it seems like a rich paradise where any want can be attained. Yet below, in the dingy streets of the capital city, High Perch, dissension stirs.\nAn early concept sketch of the Minos - Art by T'umo Mere\nRumors abound that the desolate stretch of land known as the Ebon Cascade has stirred with a new form of horror. Something cunning. And it's uniting the monstrous beings that call it home. Whispers say a Raksha is on Tikor, hiding away, building an army. None want to believe the horrifying rumor, yet none dare to confirm it either.\nIn the boundless waters of The Grand Divide, new forces stir as the largest pirate fleet of them all, Heaven's Fall, begins to marshal. With the cold genius of Nubia leading them, her power has begun to make those on land to take notice. The law of the sea changes as rumors of an alliance between her and the tech genius, Ken Musa begin to stir.\nIn all corners of the world, events are in motion.\n Visit the website - Official Swordsfall Website\nThe Book\nWelcome to Tikor will be an 8.5\" x 11\" hardcover book, printed on premium color for the richest and vivid colors. With this being an artbook, the quality and feel of the book is important.\n*Update* Due to the overwhelming support of our backers, we hit the goal for OFFSET PRINTING! The book will be printed by PrintNinja, with the solid binding and paper quality you wanted!\nThe main point of this Kickstarter is to raise money for the art. Being able to see the dynamic characters and unique setting with your own eyes is something that can't be replaced. The goal represents the minimum needed to make that happen.\nAs for the book, the length will be around 150 pages, though it could be longer depending on the amount of money raised. The max page count will be around 200 pages no matter what. \nNot the Final Version - Design by Taylor Ruddle\n\nThe Setting and Art Book will be a combination of T'umo's art, and Brandon's lore. Each piece of detailed full-color art will be accompanied by information about the person, place or thing it depicts For those only interested in the art, this lore will help bring the art to life and give it meaning. The kind of book you can sit down and just read.\nHowever, for those interested in the setting for their own games of the future Swordsfall RPG, then this serves as your window to the Afropunk setting. Throughout the pages, you will find a living world that easily makes the backdrop the right Tabletop System. However, this Setting and Artbook contains NO RULES. Just pure, sweet narrative world-building and fantastic art.\nSwordsfall itself has its own custom system that is deep into development.  Much of the art from the artbook will be used in the Corebook itself. Supporting this Kickstarter makes the Corebook's development even faster.\nAn early concept sketch of the Minos - Art by T'umo Mere\nThe Wallpapers\nAs a bonus to our backers all of T'umo's gorgeous work will be turned into amazing high-quality Wallpapers for your PC and phone. While the art will be used in both the Art Book and Corebook, I also want to share it with you the fans. And nothing is better than a gorgeous wallpaper on your home screen.\nThe World Map of Tikor makes for a sexy wallpaper\nAlmost every piece of art that is generated through this Kickstarter will be turned into a vivid piece of wallpaper. As well, there will be multiple resolutions available so you can always have the right size for your screen. We'll be conducting a poll after the Kickstarter to find out what the most used resolutions are. (I doubt we'll be able to do 15 resolutions for all the art)\nThat means you're not just getting the World Map as a wallpaper, but a ton of different ones with different art on it. Do you have a favorite profession? Or a favorite city in Swordsfall? Well, I'm sure there will be a wallpaper with it on it. We plan to have over 50 wallpapers in the bundle. \nA big ol fat zip of Wallpaper goodness.\nA Work in Progress shot of the Griot Wallpaper - Art by T'umo Mere, Design by Taylor Ruddle\nThe Poster\nFor the Kickstarter there will be a Limited Edition run of a full-color Poster of the final book cover. The final art cover hasn't been finalized yet, but watch for updates on Kickstarter or the Swordsfall Patreon to see what the final image is. As well, a digital version will be included with all Kickstarter PDF's as part of the Digital Stretch Goals!\nThe Poster of the Minos, currently available on Redbubble!\nIf you like the art, like the poster, then check out our shop! We already have shirts, stickers, and more already available. Buying Swordsfall swag also supports the artists! All our artists receive royalties on shirts their art is featured on.\nCheck out our Official Merchandise: The Swordsfall Shop\nSo, what exactly is the world within the pages of this book? Well, Tikor is a world divided, both in idea and land. Yet, hope remains as the two halves are only divided, not separated. The Northern Hemisphere of Tikor sports much more moderate temperatures and expansive grasslands in the center. The tip of the northern region is snow-capped, with the furthest tips permanently covered in ice.\nThe Southern Hemisphere of Tikor, on the other hand, is essentially a desert wasteland. Or at least that's what some will say. Despite the harsh conditions and cunning predators, various cultures have made a home among the barren sand and oppressive heat. With dunes that sing hypnotic lullabies, mammoth beasts and a second sun that relentlessly bakes the land, the southern half is worlds different from the North.\nThe World of Tikor\n Garuda - The largest nation in the Northwestern Hemisphere of Tikor. A land of green and grasslands, it's headed by the Order of the Divine Phoenix. The organization itself was created by the deities of the land, The Divinity.\n Vinyata - The eternal rival to Garuda and the largest nation in the Southern Hemisphere of Tikor. The desert land is home to the Dracon, a culture descended from the only heroic dragon in history, Ryuu-jin. Despite the unforgiving landscape, the people of the desert have found solace underneath enormous domed cities.\n Hawklore - On the eastern edge of the Northern half of Tikor, lies a nation sitting singular. The country is embroiled in no battles, sieges or upsets to the throne. Instead, it's been lead by one single man, a god in fact. Hawken. And within his cool and steady grip, the nation has remained at the forefront of Azurean mining and economics.\n Grimnest -The living mountain, Enkai, separates Garuda from the western portion of the Northern Hemisphere.  The wrathful deity hasn't allowed a single person to cross his crags in a millennia. It's in this isolation that the rule less land of Grimnest sits. With no official government or ruler, its a land truly free. And also home to pirates, raiders and the spirit powered bounty hunters to reign them in.\n Ramnos - Nestled in the southernmost part of the Southern Hemisphere, this reclusive nation avoids attention at almost all cost. For them, being forgotten is the best thing they could do. Trade in and out of their nation is limited, and trust is a temporary arrangement in Ramnos. And with it being located between the horrors that wait in Ebon Cascade and the Outskirts of Vinyata on the other side, most who are born there stay there.\nSecond set of concept art for the Dihoma - Art by T'umo Mere\n\n Independent Freeland of Teslan - A small island located off of Grimnest. Tucked away in the turbulent ocean, Crystal Priest train to control their gift, all while studying the secrets to Hekan itself. The school for these Azurean molders, Druse Academy, rarely allows visitors into its halls. And the ring of Sentrylocks guarding the island makes it a place people only come to by invitation.\n The Grand Divide -The vast ocean that almost splits the land in two has its own personality. Its sparkling blue and green seas can turn harsh at any given moment. With hellish winds and torrential rain coming on seemingly at its whim. And if the weather doesn't get you, the pirates may. Yet millions flock to the sea everywhere. In search of glory, freedom, and prizes on its sea.\n Ebon Cascade - This perilous zone has swallowed up a chunk of the western part of the Southern Hemisphere. The air near the plagued lands seem to make every pore cry out, threatening to vomit. The waters run yellow with poison and the air feels stiff with suffering. Yet throughout the harshness, humans continue to visit the lands. Pushing their luck, and eventually their lives.\n The Canopy -  Located on the very western quarter of the Northern Hemisphere, this mountain region is unlike anything on Tikor. The peaks of the half a dozen mountains can't be seen from the ground level. Even if you could see them, these majestic peaks are not safe for visiting or habitation. Tales float around about mysterious creatures that whisk away anyone that dares venture into these lands.\nMinos Concept Bust - Art by Tumo Mere\n For More Lore: The Swordsfall World Anvil\n $4,000 \nMoar art from T'umo Mere\nA Deadquiver in action - T'umo Mere\nAt this Pledge level we'll be able to add more fantastic artwork to the Welcome to Tikor. Drawn by Swordsfall team member, T'umo Mere. We'll be adding in more characters to help further illustrate Tikor's diversity with more their detailed illustrations.\n\n $7,000 \nLandscapes and Cities from Sabina Lewis\nSphaerum (Previous Work) - Art by Sabina Lewis\nA world simply isn't complete without vivid scenery to immerse yourself in. To accomplish that, we've enlisted the help of a master in landscape design. The amazing Sabina Lewis! She's agreed to be a guest member on the Swordsfall to help bring the luscious world to life. When we hit this pledge level she'll be able to bring Tikor's incredible world to life.\n\n $10,000 \n Second PDF \"Tikor: The Professionals\"\nNot the Final Version - Design by Taylor Ruddle\nWith your continued support we will be able to release a SECOND PDF as part of the Kickstarter. In the future this will be sold separately, but this and any other unlocked PDF's will be included as part of your Kickstarter!\nTikor: The Professionals will detail the 34 unique professions used in the Swordsfall Corebook. However, they are not classes, they truly are Professions. They are a symbol of not what someone is, but truly what they accomplish in life. The Professionals will talk about these professions in detail including history, location and important figures within each. Each Profession will be accompanied with full page art from T'umo Mere.\n\n $12,000 \nChibi Profession Art and Pins\nA Chibi Celestial Shield in the middle along side two other examples\nSwordsfall team member Taylor Ruddle has long had a love for Chibi art, even studying in Japan to hone his art. He's bring those skills to Tikor by designing Chibi versions of all 34 of Swordsfall's Professions. \nThen we're going to take those adorable creations and craft quality pins from them. They're cute, and fiercely adorable.\n\n $15,000 \n10 page Comic \"The Rise of Nubia\" Prologue\nThe story of Tikor's most famous and powerful pirate is one that needs more than just words. To describe the true depth of the character, only a comic can suffice. And so if we hit this goal Brandon and T'umo will credit a comic of Nubia, leader of Heaven's Fall.\nNubia has become a fan favorite among those who have read the Swordsfall World Anvil. Her strong spirit and fire has made her a often talked about character. The story of her rise may be known by some already, but it's never been shown in this kind of detail or color. \n $20,000 \nThird PDF - \"Pantheons of Tikor\"\nNot the Final Version - Art by T'umo Mere | Design by Taylor Ruddle\nThe world of Tikor would not be where it is without the help of its divine beings. Almost the entire world is covered in various spirits and deities. Some influencing the people, and some hindering them.\nIf we reach this goal another PDF will be produced. This one all about the Pantheons that exist on Tikor. From the The Divinity in Garuda to the Orisha in the Outskirts of Vinyata, each pantheon will be detailed. Each pantheon will have gorgeous art alongside of it to show you the lives the divine live.\n$26,000 \nTop Notch Editing and Formatting\nAt this point with now three books in the lineup, we've more than maxed our ability to edit in house or within our circles. It's official become time to bring in the experts.\nIf we hit this tier we'll be able to commission the help of a number of freelance editors to help make the books truly shine. And most importantly, be effortlessly readable (because sometimes English is hard).\n $35,000 \nDragons and Creatures from Jonah Lobe\nDragons from Elder Scrolls: Skyrim - Designed by Jonah Lobe\nA true legendary figure has joined the Swordsfall team for a limited engagement. His creatures are ones you've certainly seen before. Jonah was the genius behind many of the Tamriel's most famous creatures such as the Dragons, Giants, and Draugr. He was also the whiz behind the grotesque Deathclaw and freakish Super Mutants from Fallout 4.\nIf we reach $35,000 the master Jonah himself will apply his dragon scales to the Afropunk style of The Wretched Ones. Swordsfall's own winged horrors. As well, he'll also draw other varied creatures from Tikor's wildlife.\n\n$50,000\nCharacter Design From Venus Bambisa\nTitan Slayer: Tinishi (Previous Work) - Art by Venus Bambisa\nThe look and feel of characters is important to Swordsfall, we want to create truly something unique. To help make the Tikor as rich as possible, we're bringing one of South Africa's most talented Character Concept artist, Venus Bambisa.\nHer design's are just jaw dropping in the way they same to flow an anime style with black faces. Her Artstation has character designs of all sorts, each of them elegant, sleek and badass. I especially love how she shows a characters increase in power. Who doesn't love transforming heroes?\n\n $70,000 \nFourth PDF - \"The Animalists' Guide to Creatures\" - Art by Jonah Lobe and T'umo Mere\nNot the Final Version - Design by Taylor Ruddle\nThe final and ultimate goal. A FOURTH book through this kickstarter, and the most expensive. That's because this book will be the most art heavy of them all, featuring art from both Jonah Lobe and T'umo Mere.\nAt this final amount we'll craft a trip through the wildlife across Tikor. From the monstrous Nandi Bear to the adorable and house trained Aardwolf. Each animal will be drawn by one of these dynamic pair. This is not a Monster Manual however, this, like the other books, will be narrative journey through the world. Instead focusing on the the animals and how they fit into the world. Their tales and even their bestial gods.\n\n$100,000\nThe Azurean Finish\nArtist Rendering of the Boxset, not ANYWHERE close to the final design. (The final version will be way cooler, and full of T'umo art)\nWhen we hit the $100,000 goal, I can do what people have wanted for over a week, ALL of the books printed. However, I'm going to do one better and not just print all four books, but print them in stupid high quality. And put in a few little extras. Lets see what your getting!\nThe Details\nAll four books printed\nTwo Variant covers for the Setting and Artbook\nEmbossed covers on all books\nSilk Ribbon bookmark on all books\nAll tucked in a Custom Slipcase with special art\n\n$130,000\nUnleash the Beast\nSwordsfall Studios can come to life\nWhen we hit $130,000 the Formation of Swordsfall Studios will begin! This will allow the core team to work full-time on future projects! Brandon and T'umo will be able to devote their full time and energy to the world!\nThat means more content, the RPG sooner and more! We have so much stuff planned, short run comics, adventures and even modules. All together with a part-time editor, we can bring the project to the NEXT LEVEL!\nWant to change your order to include more extra items? No worries, you can increase your pledge reward to include them! You can even add multiple of the same item, including the book.\n Books:\nWelcome to Tikor | A Swordsfall Setting and Art Book PDF - $30\nWelcome to Tikor | A Swordsfall Setting and Art Book Hardcover- $50\nOther:\nLimited Edition \"Welcome to Tikor\" Poster - $5\nChibi Pin - $5\nDon't worry, it's cool to have to this stuff at work now.

Just add on the extra cost of the Add-ons onto of your level when you pledge.\nThe Griot Profession - Art by T'umo Mere\nPrint\nWe are now doing our Printing through PrintNinja! It'll be Offset printing and all sorts of extra goodies are going to be in it. Thanks to our backers we were able to bump up the quality!\n\nShipping\nFor this Kickstarter we will not be paying for your shipping. However, since we are going through Magpie Games, the shipping cost are fairly standard.

Thanks to you we\u2019re funded and Brooklyn is getting a new arcade bar! We can\u2019t wait to have all of you at Wonderville!\nNow the fun stuff! If we clear our goal by an additional $15,000 ($85,000 total), we\u2019ll celebrate by building a two-player PICO-8 arcade machine. It will be hand-made and painted by a local artist!\nFor those not familiar with it, PICO-8 is a fantasy, retro console in the style of the Commodore 64. It\u2019s a lot of fun to make small games in, and a lot of our community has done just that! With this arcade we\u2019ll be able to rotate what\u2019s on display, showcasing different locally-made PICO-8 games in all of their 128x128 glory! \nIf we clear our goal by $30,00 ($100,000 total), we'll be redoing the backyard to make it look amazing. Secret Project Robot has a great outdoor space, and with a little love we can get it (and the cabana!) looking better than ever!\nWonderville will be a brand new arcade, event space and bar in Brooklyn specializing in independent video games, created by a growing and vibrant community of game developers in New York City and beyond. \nWe're not talking about retro arcade games from the 80s and 90s or just arcade versions of mobile games; these games are brand new, unique and ridiculously original experiences created by designers and artists today. Ever played games using only LED strips? Or door stops? Or juicers? At Wonderville you will! \nUp to this point, these games have only shown up at festivals and short-term pop-ups as physical installations meant to be played by a group of people in a public space, and then they disappear. But no more! Wonderville will house independent games as a permanent home for these modern treasures. The space will also host tournaments, playtest nights, board games, comedy, live music and rotating art installations and exhibits.\nWe have an amazing opportunity to inherit one of our favorite spaces, and transform it into a new celebration of independent games and interactive art, but we need your support to make it happen. Join us, and help make this venture a reality, and you can also receive amazing Kickstarter exclusive games, art and handmade arcade cabinets from independent game developers and artists!\nWe've got a lot of great game developers on board who are volunteering to make an exclusive game for this campaign! And we're combining it all to create:\nAt $20 ($15 for the limited EARLY BIRD), you'll get new games from some of the most innovative video game developers working today! A slew of devs are donating a brand new, exclusive game for the WONDERBUNDLE! This is an exclusive collection that you'll only find as part of this Kickstarter and nowhere else! \nYou'll get 10+ new games by:\n BumbleBear Games (Killer Queen)\n Ramiro Corbetta (Hokra/Sports Friends)\n snowhydra games (Zarvot)\n Robert Yang + Eddie Cameron (Radiator 2 & Queer Space)\n Catt Small  (Breakup Squad)\n Stephen Clark (Witch Ball)\n Fernando Ramallo (PANORAMICAL)\n Nick Fortugno (Diner Dash)\n Ayla Myers (Just One Boss)\n Ramsey Nasser (Dialog 3-D)\n Andy Wallace (PARTICLE MACE)\n Nick Santaniello (VOLLEYGON)\n Paolo Pedercini/Molleindustria (Every Day the Same Dream)\nMany of these games are being made especially for this event and none of them have been released anywhere else! These game makers have agreed to have these games be completely exclusive to this backer reward for one year after delivery (some time before September), so this is your chance to play them anytime soon!\n\nFor the past few years, we've been selling DBA Arcade Snackpack volumes filled with assorted games from the developers in our collective. For $40, you'll get the Wonderbundle, as well as both Snackpacks, with modern classics such as PARTICLE MACE, VOLLEYGON, Slam City Oracles, POWERBOAT Italia '88 and more! That's 20+ games and art from DBA Arcade to you!\n\nFor $45 you'll get an exclusive T-shirt ONLY available through the Kickstarter campaign. There are three designs by artists Marlowe Dobbe, Preston Spurlock, and Tim Fite. These will be available in all sizes and in both straight and fitted cuts! Pledge three times to score all three Kickstarter exclusive designs! Then come visit us at Wonderville in your shirt and prepare for lots and lots of high fives and nods of admiration.\n\nPin your indie arcade pride on your chest (or backpack, hat or your dog's collar) with a set of four premium custom designed limited edition enamel pins featuring Wonderville and other arcade designs. For $60 you'll get both games bundles, plus this set of exclusive Wonderville enamel pins designed by Chris Hernandez. Dreamboxx and Videofreak will use glitter enamel for their reflective and shiny bits, and Dreamboxxx will also be rainbow plated metal. These are limited edition, and will only be available through the Kickstarter campaign!\n\n\n\nAlt.Ctrl Workshop hosted by Death By Audio Arcade and Brooklyn Research\nOn the weekends at Wonderville, we plan to host classes and workshops taught by game design instructors, fabricators, and designers from the community in Brooklyn and beyond. Pledge to one of our workshop tiers and you can choose to learn about game design in Unity, physical computing with Arduino, modular synthesizer design and/or animations in Processing. A laptop is the only required material for the workshops, no need to have any existing knowledge to take part, we'll get you all set! \nIf you select one of these tiers, we'll coordinate to host the class on a date that works best for all students. If you cannot attend for some reason, we will give you a voucher for a future Wonderville class.\nFor our top tiers, we'll send you a custom-made bartop arcade cabinet or a full size arcade cabinet that includes all of the games in our collection: PARTICLE MACE, VOLLEYGON, KungFu Kickball, Slam City Oracles, Nothing Good Can Come of This, Powerboat Italia '88, F\u00fatbol Forever and Crystal Brawl. \nWe've built over 25 custom cabinets and we're confident these will be the best yet! The marquee and side art will be custom-painted by an artist from New York City - each one will be unique - and we can ship via freight anywhere in the lower 48 states. \nThrough our five years on the road, Death By Audio Arcade has been showcased at many venues and festivals. Here's a small sampling of the press we've received during that time:\n\nKotaku: Meet The Guy Making Arcade Cabinets For Indie Games\nWall Street Journal: Nostalgic for the Atari-Era Arcade? Millennial Gamers Are Reinventing It\nGothamist : Step Into the Dreamhouse, Where DIY Arcade Games Meet Queer Culture\nBedford+Bowery : An Indie Game Arcade Has Opened at Elsewhere\nThe Fader: Meet Mark Kleback, The Technologist Bringing Old-School Arcade Games Into The Future\nWonderville, the brainchild of Mark Kleback, was born out of his work as a creative technologist and founder of Death By Audio Arcade.\nDeath By Audio Arcade is a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in New York City, founded in 2013 in the back of the punk warehouse, Death By Audio, in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. In addition to a music venue, Death By Audio was a loft space occupied by Mark and 12 other artists, musicians and DIY-enthusiasts. With access to a wood shop, Mark built his first arcade cabinet and started reaching out to local game developers to find games for his handmade arcade builds. Since independent musicians had dedicated spaces to showcase their art, why not indie game devs? \nWonderville builds on the foundation of Death By Audio Arcade, which collaborates with game developers and teaches them how to cut and paint wood, solder electronics and assemble physical installations for video games. Most game designers are used to making games to be played at home on a computer, but by showing games in public spaces, these designers also learn how to make great social arcade games. \nWe also host talks and panels and invite local artists to showcase games at public events. Since 2013, we've built over 20 custom arcade cabinets and we've been featured at the Smithsonian American Art Museum, MAGFest, World Maker Faire New York, South By Southwest, PlayNYC and Low-Level Festival. We've been a transformative organization for people looking to learn more about doing hands-on projects in an increasingly digital world.\nDeath By Audio Arcade at Elsewhere\nWhen Death By Audio closed in 2014, Death By Audio Arcade was left homeless and shifted focus to partnerships with other local New York venues for months at a time. Over the past five years, we've had residencies at Elsewhere, Superchief Gallery,  Babycastles, Caveat, Our Wicked Lady, Flattopps, Flux Factory, Silent Barn, Dreamhouse, H0L0, Brooklyn Research, Flowers For All Occasions, and Secret Project Robot.\nStephanie Gross is co-founder of Wonderville and has a decades long history of helping artists and organizations become non-profits and leverage their talents to achieve their dreams. As a NY city employee, Stephanie is a valuable resource for former residents of the DIY underground art world looking to navigate the bureaucracy of licenses, permits, and city departments. \nNew Year's Eve 2010\nSteph and Mark met at a show in 2010 at Death By Audio, one of her first clients. They're now engaged to be married later this year! \u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\udc8d\u2728\n In late 2018, Rachel Nelson and Erik Zajaceskowski, the owners of Secret Project Robot, approached Mark and Stephanie about taking over their space. Secret Project Robot has been an artist-run venue in New York City for over fifteen years, hosting art installations, performance art, live music and community meetings. The opportunity was too good to be true. Not only would this space provide a home for the nomadic Death By Audio Arcade collection, but it would be a hub for the entire New York City indie game community. Not to mention it's 100% legal with a bar and liquor license!\n With your pledge, we'll have the funds to buy the business, with all of the necessary permits, licenses, inventory, and machinery. There are eight years remaining on the lease, and with your help, we'll be able to start with enough capital to run for the first 6-12 months. \nPaper Gardens Festival at Secret Project Robot\nAnd Wonderville isn't just for DBAA games, we have plans to collaborate with our friends in New York (and eventually the world)! While we spent time as nomads, we met a lot of like-minded developers: we've done collaborative events with Babycastles and The Sheep's Meow and continue to discuss setting up a rotating gallery space. We've shown work by Bumblebear and Videogamo and many many more. We plan to have a Killer Queen Machine, a Black Emperor machine, and a Line Wobbler. We'll work with the NYU Game Center and host playtest nights and panel discussions. On the weekends, we will host workshops based around game design, electronics, and fabrication. \nAllen Riley of Death By Audio Arcade showing video game art at Superchief Gallery\n\nWe want to make sure Wonderville is a home for everyone doing or interested in indie arcade work! \nWe'll also host live music! Secret Project Robot has an amazing stage and sound system that we plan to keep: DJs, musicians, bands, comedy shows, and other events are all on deck! We want to create a community space that bridges the gap between the games community and the wider New York arts and music community.\nWith your help, we can make all of this happen, buckle up and join us! ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe rent is too damn high! It's really hard to keep a venue open in New York City. We've already been pushed out of one underground space due to rising rents, and this time we want to make sure we have enough of a savings to get it off the ground. We have a solid business plan vetted by Stephanie\u2019s non-profit background and informed by both Mark and Steph's years of living and working in music venues. We've also got many people volunteering their time to help with the success of Wonderville, but your contribution goes a long way!\n\nDeath by Audio Arcade will continue to operate as a 501(c)3 not-for-profit organization inside of Wonderville.

Someone who can guide the magical community into the next age of sorcery, enchantment, and magical drama. How to decide who could possibly carry such a burden? The way witches have for millennia: throw a ridiculous party and show off your very best outfit.\nBe Witching is a tabletop story game for four or more players. Each player represents one of the esteemed Witch Houses competing for favor at the millennial Witches' Prom. They'll do this by drawing rad witches and playing mini-games that let them show off their witch's outfit, magical powers, and sparkling personality.\nIt's a role-playing game for kids, adults, or both at the same time that celebrates the magic of femme expression and the power in being your most authentic self.\nSlumber party witches!\nNOTE: Images are of the original version of the game. This Kickstarter is for a total revamp of the rules and game content!\nHow it works\nBe Witching is made up of bunch of smaller mini-games. Players will play mini-games to create Witch Houses, to compete in magical duels, and to draw beautiful outfits.\nOnce players decide on a theme for the prom, each player picks one of eight witch character templates to start with. Then they get drawing! Players grab markers or crayons (or magazines and scissors??) and draw their witches' amazing prom outfits. Each player will get a chance to introduce their witch by narrating her dramatic entrance to the prom.\nOver several rounds, players will make their claim to witchqueendom by showing off their magical abilities, asking each other interview questions, and winning fantastic awards. And at the end, someone (or someones) will give an acceptance speech and rule the prom.\nIt is a magical game packed with fun little ideas I can't wait to share.\nInclusion and representation\nThe original Be Witching included six character templates by artist Solomon Fletcher that serve as starting points for players' drawings. The new version of the game will include two completely new character templates.\nWe're queer creators and we've tried to create body- and size-positive art that celebrates all kinds of femme bodies, including disabled, trans, non-binary and male witches.\n(There's even a furry template!)\nThe six witch templates already designed.\nWhy Kickstarter?\nBe Witching was one of the first games I made when I was starting to work on tabletop story games. When I first made it in 2015, it ended up a little bit closer to a board game than to the amazing imaginative story game it was meant to be.\nNow that I've gained confidence as a story game designer through a bunch more role-playing projects, I feel ready to revisit my earlier creation and update it into something really special.\nThis Kickstarter will fund:\nThe design and playtesting of completely revamped rules and content.\nTwo new character templates by Solomon.\nLayout, design and printing for a brand new zine of the game.\nThe zine\nBe Witching is a game about being arty, beautiful and DIY, so it's always been designed with the zine format in mind! When the staples are removed from your Be Witching zine, you're left with four sheets of character templates (two per sheet) and a neat four-page rulebook.\n(You'll be able to print out more templates via free online pdfs -- or draw your own!)\nImage by Curi Lagann (@hedgemom on twitter!)\nWho am I anyway?\nHi! I'm Anna Anthropy. I've made a whole bunch of games, both analog and digital. I've also written books -- my newest is Make Your Own Twine Games, which will be out in March 2019. It's the first in a series of books for kids about how to make video games with free software! My day job is teaching game design at DePaul University in Chicago. I am a powerful femme witch, and my familiar is a little black cat named Encyclopedia Frown.\nThe character templates are by Solomon Fletcher (possible NSFW content!) and the cover art is by Pseudonym Jones!\nThank you for supporting magical games!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe biggest risk is...I've never run a Kickstarter before!

What's that? Your new coworkers are office supplies that came to life? How silly! These are real people who would love to get to know you! As our newest intern, it\u2019s crucial that you get to know your new coworkers. After all, you\u2019re going to be spending a lot of time together!\nPlay the demo/see more info here: https://www.heavythoughtstudios.com/devblog/\nWe at Heavy Thought Studios are excited to bring you The Office Type, a comedy dating sim game where group interaction takes center stage. Pick your roster of eight characters, choose your ideal relationship path with each of them (relationship, intimacy, or friendship), and get to know their friend groups to uncover deep storylines. After months of hard work and preparation, we\u2019re ready to get things rolling in order to bring our unique cast of characters to you. See below for details on our goal, our reward tiers, and our stretch goals. We have the inventory list, so to speak, but we need your help!\n In the world of The Office Type, you, a new intern at the computer company CompCorp, have been seemingly forgotten by your coworkers on your birthday. After a wish on a stale birthday cupcake's candle, an online quiz magically fills the company with individuals who strangely resemble everyday office supplies. The last month of your internship is packed with countless adventures to flesh out each character\u2019s story, and it\u2019s entirely up to you who you decide to get to know.\nThree character options within each character set allow players to express their interest in whatever ways they please, while still making any roster combination cohesive through the different types of eight different office supplies. The world has so much to explore, so why can\u2019t your office be the same? Twenty-four possible characters means several different personality types, ranging from stiff upper-management to the playful HR department and everything in between. \n Talk with three characters per day, navigating their stories and gaining experience. Knowing them well will create a bond more quickly, but you'll also be learning to love yourself along the way!\n Mid-date minigames test your ability to make a connection with specific characters, with varying levels of success available. Click and drag to chain together same-color sticky notes and create the biggest combos possible! You can also gain bonus points with certain characters by scoring with their favorite color.\n Your time in the office is yours to enjoy again and again, with buddy characters granting you insight into characters in their friend circles. Different character rosters create different friend groups, allowing for a wide variety of gameplay experiences.\nIt\u2019s a truly unique office environment. What will your internship be like?\n Where did this idea come from? Who even thinks of dating office supplies? Surely the designers didn't pick up a pencil and a pen and imagine them as siblings and then look around to see what other office supplies looked like they'd turn into attractive people to date. Uhhh, yeah... That's... totally not what happened...\nThe idea popped up as a funny concept in the midst of several fun and interesting dating games. The game is a blend of the premise of Boyfriend Dungeon, the story depth of Dream Daddy, the wacky antics of Hatoful Boyfriend, and basic mechanics from various other games, with our own special twist on the classic match-three minigame. Our inspirations have done so much to pave the way for games like this, and we're eternally grateful for the experiences their teams have created.\nAnd they're not the only ones making an impact on The Office Type! Our team is a perfect mixture of talented, thought-provoking ideas, and memes. Our brains tell us to make meaningful stories about these characters and the world they live in, but our hearts tell us that we also need more nods to Homestar Runner and Vine references. See our Twitter for a thread of our inspirations!\n The characters in The Office Type were a big undertaking. 24 unique characters? That's so many! But we spent a ton of time designing them, their personalities, their occupations, how they interact within their friend groups, and so much more. We wanted a large cast of characters that were grouped within sets for a huge variety of game options while still being cohesive.\nKeeping track of 24 completely different characters could be a bit much. But eight sets of three? That's a little more manageable! Grouping the characters like this allows players to choose their preferred roster the first time, basing their choices off of which type of each office supply fits them best. Do you want the simple ballpoint pen? Or maybe the elegance of the brush pen? Perhaps you like to put in the hard work and keep up with the fountain pen! These choices create the eight characters you'll get to know, and new choices in a second playthrough will still keep you in the mindset of the eight object types.\nAnd who the player character becomes is up to each individual player. The story may follow a shy summer intern, but who you are is as flexible as you want it to be! In addition, we felt that it was important to highlight the range of people you see in real life. Male, female, and a variety of non-binary characters make up the roster options, with each non-binary individual having their own identity.\nFor example:\nMeet Cyril, the charcoal pencil! He's a little goofy and could use some grounding in his life, but he's a talented client recruiter for CompCorp.\nOr maybe you'll take an interest in Cyril's sibling, Benny, the fountain pen! Benny is pretty rude, but you can dig under their talents as a corporate architect to reveal the heart of their passion to improve the company.\nPerhaps Cal, the graphing calculator, is more your style. A little timid, this marketing photographer just wants to fit in and express their interests like they've never been able to.\nOr Trey, the briefcase three-ring binder! There's more than meets the eye with him. His role as the head lawyer keeps him busy, and only you can help him connect with the past he's pushed away.\nEach of our 24 characters have deep and interwoven stories to explore in the full game. To see more detailed descriptions of each of the characters, visit our website's project page!\n But enough about CompCorp! Enough about what the game is about! Who is making the world of The Office Type? Who are we? Well, that's a bit of a story.\nWe'll give you the office memo version. Heavy Thought Studios is a team of independent game developers, writers, artists, programmers, and more who are dedicated to making impactful experiences. In short, we create ideas, build them up, and redefine what an indie studio can do.\nWe have many talented people involved in this project! Our character artist has worked on big projects like Dream Daddy. Our composer has made music for various clients, games, and independent films. Our voice actors have been heard in everything from SMITE to Five Nights at Freddy's to Aphmau videos to Dark Souls Twitch streams. Plus many more! All of these people come together to make a stellar team that is creating a huge and detailed world for people to dive into.\nBut if you want to know more about all of the wonderful people involved, check out our team page!\nYou can also find us on Twitter @muchtooheavy! We post updates, news, fan art, and more on there!\nAre you a member of the press? See our contact page for answers to F.A.Q.s and our press kit!\n And we've already come a long way because of our fans. We really appreciate everything the community has done so far, and The Office Type wouldn't be what it is without it. And we're so excited to bring you an amazing collection of stories that anyone can explore, so thank you for any support you can give! Can't pledge right now? Share the campaign with a friend or two! Have enough to pledge extra? Get an extra copy to share with someone you know! Or it could be for someone you don't know, I'm not your boss.\n Credit (from top to bottom, left to right): @whiskyarts, @alarnia, @frozenflights, Cheerio Keiichiro, @FibiDraws\n We're asking for $20,000 to keep working on expanding the world of The Office Type. But most of that cost is the art! Our main focus is paying our artists to complete what we envisioned: an office dating sim with at least 30 locations to visit, with favorite and least favorite locations for each character! This level of variety will help show how deep our characters' stories go, as well as will help round our characters' personalities.\nHere's how it breaks down: \n  \"But wait!\" you say. \"Something must be wrong in the accounting department! You're an office, you should be good at pie charts!\" But the chart is correct, we double-checked! The majority of the new content we need is art-based, with our writers, designers, and programmers putting the rest together behind the scenes. Our team is dedicated to finishing this game, with most of us working overtime on this alongside our normal lives. The core team is working on this project part time without up front payment, but we've all been putting our heart and souls into this and we're not stopping now! We believe in this game and ourselves, and reaching our goal will allow us to finish the art on our projected schedule. And this breakdown can be updated if we exceed our goal, so please help us get there!\nWe have several reward tiers for you to get your ideal office romance experience! Each reward tier has all of the rewards of the previous tiers, including limited tiers! (This doesn't include combining the early bird game copy tier with the regular game copy tier, or the Employee of the Month tier.)\nSummer Intern - $5\nGet your own piece of The Office Type world with a special PDF art book! This art book will be packed with behind-the-scenes information about our characters and the world they inhabit. Anything from last names to favorite locations to backstory will be included, plus exclusive sketches and early looks at the final art. It's labeled with the same release date as the game itself, but you might see it earlier than that!  In addition, you'll have the option to put your name or pseudonym in the game's credits. Every little bit helps!\nSales Rep (plus Early Bird version!) - $15\nThis reward tier adds a copy of the game when it's complete, as either a Steam key or DRM-Free copy for PC, Mac, or Linux. Get your early bird copy before they run out!\nEmployee of the Month - $20 (CLOSED)\nIn this special reward tier, backers who selected or upgraded to Employee of the Month will get several exclusive rewards! Not only will you have your own name plaque on our custom Employee of the Month board, you'll be included in special perks! Anytime we use a large list of people in relation to the game's content (Antonella's art followers, Bee's music patrons, etc.), your name will be incorporated into the list! You'll also get behind-the-scenes updates from the team on the game's progress. We'll be sharing regular updates for everyone, but these backers will get exclusive info and extra looks at what we're working on!\nAnd we wanted this reward tier to be truly special. You showed that you care about this game, so these backers will get an alternate version of our art book. This special version will have all of the content from the regular art book, plus extra team commentary about characters, concept art, behind-the-scenes details of how we made some decisions, and more!\nIf you already pledged more than this tier, first of all, thank you! If you already pledged at least $100, you'll automatically be included in this tier! You can also join this tier by backing at the CEO tier or higher, even after the limited time period has closed!\nBreak Room Buddy - $25\nWhat's better than a copy of the game? How about TWO copies of the game?\nClient Recruiter - $50\nIf you're reaching for a higher position in the company, maybe consider joining our sponsor tier! These backers will have their name, pseudonym, or company name displayed in a prominent special thanks area of BOTH the game's credits AND the art book. Get yourself up on that Employee of the Month wall!\nCopywriter - $75\nThe Office Type has 30 dates for each character. You can help us design one of them! Leave your mark on an integral part of a character's storyline, plus get all of the previous rewards!\nCEO - $100\nYou did it. You made it up there with the rest of the big dogs. Thank you so much! This tier will get you a special message, joke, or reference in a notable place in the game AND an Easter egg in the game's artwork! Want to design a character's catchphrase? Want to see a statue of yourself in the game? Want your band to be on stage at a concert? Work with us to leave a lasting impression in The Office Type!\nAngel Investor - $200\nEvery office has its secrets. That's why the team put theirs into these little paper shredders! Wait a minute... Most of the secrets didn't get shredded! Oh no! Now each person who gets one of these mini paper shredders will find behind-the-scenes photos, exclusive artwork from the team, and more, all customized for each individual backer! Good thing we shredded a piece of the biggest secret and put one into each shredder. There's no way that people will work together to see what the whole thing reveals once it's put together!\nChair of the Board - $500\nYou must be really interested in The Office Type! We don't blame you, there's a lot to explore in the world we're making. But it all started somewhere, and the person who takes this reward tier will receive the one and only notebook with the first handwritten notes about the game! You'll see initial thoughts, exclusive designs, and bad jokes from the mind of the creator. This tier includes the paper shredder collectible!\nWE'VE REACHED OUR FUNDING GOAL! Thank you so much to everyone who contributed! And now we have some exciting stretch goals to reach for in the last 24 hours! \nOur project is already heavily focused on the artwork, with more than 30 locations to visit. But what if those locations included more specific additions? Spending time in the office? Why not in the break room, or the server room? Going to the beach? Why not take a ride on a boat? Reaching this goal will mean a more detailed world in which to get to know these characters.\nWe have more exciting stretch goals to reveal, but one step at a time! We're so grateful to people who can contribute to the campaign, and we'd love to reach the secrets we have planned!\nWhile we'd like to see this game on consoles, this campaign will focus on PC, Mac, and Linux builds to start. See our FAQ section for more details!\nThank you so much for your support! It means the world to us, and we're so excited to bring this brand new dating experience to you. We want to make the most varied, most replayable, most enjoyable dating sim game out there, and we're well on our way with your help.

(Wikipedia)\nPocket says: \"Meow! Mew meow meow. PRR!\" Then he curled up in a ball and fell asleep. When we tried to reach him for further comment, he growled and hissed at us! It seems he's not a lapcat by nature.. and certainly not a romantic partner. Platonic love can be fulfilling, too!\nRowan says: \"Hi? This is sudden for me. I'm going to need some time. I'm - never mind. I don't want to bother you. I'll call you, but... please be patient.\" \nThrough your support, we've funded Rowan the Scythe, our second dateable non-binary weapon! They're being designed by Hato Moa, creator of Hatoful Boyfriend.\nLeah says: \u201cHey, cutie. Thanks for including me. I usually like to train alone, but maybe we can try the dunj as a team sport. It\u2019ll be an adventure. Just promise you\u2019ll try your best\u2026 and play fair.\u201d\nYou've manged to fund Leah the Hammer as another stretch goal, our second dateable female weapon!\nAxe says: \"It's a beautiful day, so... what do you say we leave these computers behind and just go hang out on the beach? Feel free to come surf with me, but... I might not talk much. I hope that's okay. I'd still like your company.\"  \nYou funded the Axe! His name will be voted on in our exclusive Discord server (any reward tier at VIP/$35 or above). Invites will be sent out for it soon after the Kickstarter ends, so hold on tight!\nYou\u2019re free to date only one weapon if you are the monoblade-ous type of person, but nobody minds if you favor grabbing multiple hilts. As you level up your love with them, each Love Rank lets you proceed further with that character\u2019s plot line(s), and also offers combat bonuses.\nYou\u2019ve been unlucky in love, but you came to Verona Beach to learn from your Cousin Jesse, who\u2019s promised to help you out. Who are you exactly? You choose! You can customize your character, and choose from him, her, or them as pronouns. This doesn\u2019t affect who you can date or what options you have.\nFair Verona Beach, where we lay our scene, is in many ways a typical southern California town. The weather\u2019s great, the surf is high, and the slang 'dunj' is dangerous. In this gig economy, some people turn to killing monsters for a quick buck\u2026 while others discover they can transform into weapons.  \nVerona Beach is populated by various other people (baristas, security guards, shop keepers, etc). They\u2019re mostly pretty nice, and some of them even care about you!  \nBut something darker lurks in Verona Beach\u2026\nUnfortunately, kissing can\u2019t solve all of your problems. Sometimes, you need a sword. Wait, stop kissing the sword. Wield it instead!\nThese days, kids get money and meet people by killing monsters in the dunj, making the world a safer place in the process. Be brave -- local authorities are willing to give you basic medical attention afterwards. Clearing local infestations is a group effort!    \nThe first dunj is the Verona Beach Center, a mall overrun by creatures most hideous. We have two more dunjs in progress, the Nightclub and something secret! Each dunj features different monster types, challenges, music, potential romantic spots to find, and secrets to discover.    \nBoss monsters may also interrupt your dunj flow, so train up and make sure you and your weapon are both ready for a tough fight!  \nBoss concepts\nSometimes there are enemies that swarm; sometimes you need to focus your attacks; sometimes you need to move around to avoid an onslaught! Some weapons will be better-suited to some dunjs and enemy encounters than others.  \nIt\u2019s up to you to find the best tactics in each situation\u2026 or you could just get more experience and level up until you one-shot them, if you prefer. A general idea of how each weapon plays: \nLeft: Talwar | Right: Dagger\nTalwar attacks and combos tend to cover a wider area, while Dagger attacks and combos tend to be quick and focus on a narrower area. \nLeft: Epee | Right: Lasersaber\nEpee attacks and combos tend to require precision but have the capability to stun, while Lasersaber attacks and combos can be upgraded to reflect projectiles and do ranged attacks! \nAll of these (plus the development of Glaive and Brass Knuckles) are likely to evolve as we continue to work on the game. We\u2019ve made good progress, but our Kickstarter backers will help us nail down many of the details in the coming months. \nWhat if it\u2019s too easy or too hard? We\u2019ll have difficulty modes, but we\u2019d also like to offer special challenges and opt-in modifiers for folks that want to, for example, make enemies have more health, or want to fight optional bosses, in exchange for more loot. This means the game will be complete-able at a basic level even by folks who normally stick to dating sims, while also offering some \"fun\" to those poor masochists who have been damaged by Dark Souls (you know who you are). \nA good relationship with your weapon starts with a romantic date. Luckily for you, Verona Beach is filled with dreamy date spots like the local museum, sunny beach, or flashy nightclub. Make the right choices and you might find your weapons warming up to you!\nAs you date each weapon, you\u2019ll learn more about them and earn their trust, making you a more effective team in combat. \nBut, in this game as in real life, every relationship is a little bit different in its benefits and demands. Some partners will teach you how to do more damage, while others will help you use skills more effectively.\nEven when you're busy slaying monsters, the dunj will feature spots for some mini-dates, because love knows no bounds. Above all, you'll be able to cultivate meaningful relationships full of supportive and inviting weapon babes... it just might take a bit of charm to get them out of their sheathes. \nYou\u2019re probably wondering what you\u2019re going to get from backing! Well, I mean, other than the eternal love and gratitude of the Kitfox team, of course.\nReceive a dev-signed postcard from Verona Beach! Available in the Long Distance Relationship tier and above.\nThe Kickstarter-exclusive enamel pin, available in the Bae Box Set tier and above.\nThe Bae Box Set includes an elegant rose USB key, in which to hide your heart's secrets.\n  Everything in the Bae Box tier. Includes: the game, soundtrack, rose USB key, enamel pin, and sticker sheet, all in a beautiful box for your shelf.\nTemperature changing Boyfriend Dungeonmaster mugs of infinite thirst. Included in the Ultimate Collector's Edition.\nTransform Talwar OR Dagger at will from their human form (front) to weapon form (back). One of your choice is included in the Ultimate Collector's Edition.\nThis super-soft, high-quality cotton blend Sword Smoocher shirt color combo (white on black) is only available via the Ultimate Collector's Edition tier!\nEverything in the Ultimate Collector's Edition tier. Includes: T-Shirt, Messenger Bag, Stickers, Soundtrack CD, Mug, Pin, USB Rose game copy, Collector's Edition Box Set, and a Body Pillowcase of your choosing\nThe music, sound effects and audio design overall will be managed by Omar Dabbous, audio designer of GNOG by KO_OP.  \nThe soundtrack of Boyfriend Dungeon is an hour of all-original summery weapon-pop from the master composer Marskye (also of GNOG), often featuring the vocals of Madeleine McQueen.    \nTheir collaboration has already produced a few amazing tracks, including the main theme song you hear in the trailer, \u201cWithout a Weapon\u201d (Soundcloud link):   \n  And, presented here for the first time, a preview of the new soon-to-be-hit single, Spellbound:\n If you back the project now, you\u2019re sure to get notified when we post more songs and track previews in the future, during and after the campaign.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Background Illustration: Jessica Mao is creating most of the game\u2019s background illustrations! They're an illustrator from Toronto, currently working as a Jr. Art Director for mobile games in the San Francisco Bay Area. Their past work includes animations and illustrations for Titmouse, Studio Yotta, Konami and Penguin Random House. Jessica would transform into a Shield in the dunj.\nAnimation: Sunder Raj from Particle Beam made the beautiful animation of Talwar's transformation! We'd love to hire Particle Beam to make transformation sequences for the rest of the weapons, but we'll see what we can afford... Sunder from Particle Beam would transform into a Durian in the dunj.\nJapanese Localization & Publishing: We loved working with Kakehashi Games to bring the best version of Moon Hunters and The Shrouded Isle to Japan, so we'll be working with them again for Boyfriend Dungeon. The lead of Kakehashi, Zach, would transform into a Kusarigama in the dunj.\nMerch Design & Manufacturing: We were really impressed by the Moon Hunters indiebox, so we decided to work with them to create the Boyfriend Dungeon merch, which resulted in the luscious tiers of rewards here. If you're looking to make money from shirts & pins, we recommend Indiebox, so hit up James at ConferenceMerch.com (tell him Tanya sent ya)! The lead of Indiebox, James, would transform into Nunchucks in the dunj.\nHey, we're Kitfox Games! We're an independent Montreal-based games studio with a soft spot for exploring and discovering new, dangerous worlds. Previously, we made Shattered Planet, Moon Hunters, The Shrouded Isle, and in addition to making Boyfriend Dungeon we're publishing Six Ages.\nThe Boyfriend Dungeon team\nTanya X. Short (@tanyaxshort): Captain, Lead Designer. Led Kitfox in creating Moon Hunters and Shattered Planet, and wrote for and published The Shrouded Isle. Previously was a senior designer on The Secret World and Age of Conan. Tanya has never said she didn't date a weapon, so you could probably say this game is based on a true story. Nobody can prove otherwise. Tanya would transform into a Sabre in the dunj.\nXin Ran Liu (@xinranliu): Art Director. Previously art directed Moon Hunters and Shattered Planet, and illustrated tons of different things, from book covers to band posters to game concept art. Xin would transform into a Chakram in the dunj.  \nMarcelo Perez (@scientistsloth): Lead Programmer. Marcelo (almost) single-handedly coded the Moon Hunters cooking system and also ported Moon Hunters to all the consoles! Now that he\u2019s almost recovered from such a feat, he\u2019s making sure Boyfriend Dungeon is better-structured for porting. Marcelo would transform into a Meteor Hammer in the dunj.\nKira Boom (@snowkittykira): Dungeon Programmer. Kira was the primary combat programmer for Moon Hunters, and previously did lots of programming on FRACT OSC. She\u2019s also part of Mindfungus, which released the adorable Cityglitch! Kira is a wielder, not a weapon.\nVictoria Tran (@thevtran): Community Manager & Public Relations. Victoria has been managing the Kitfox events, community, press, and social media for over a year now, so if you\u2019ve fallen in love with silly Boyfriend Dungeon gifs, that\u2019s her genius. Victoria would transform into a Bread Knife in the dunj.  \nHey, I Remember Moon Hunters!\nThank you to everyone who backed our first Kickstarter in 2014! Because of their help, and other funding sources, we were able to create our first big game, Moon Hunters! Moon Hunters sold decently well and won some awards, so, it\u2019s hard to complain. Plus we released it with only a few months of delay -- not bad.\nWe learned a few lessons along the way, which we\u2019re applying to Boyfriend Dungeon, like to carefully structure support for potential future DLC. There was also Shattered Planet and the Shrouded Isle, but we didn\u2019t Kickstart them. I hope you still bought them. We sure learned a lot from those, too.\nThere are also a few Kitfoxes working on a different game (you might wonder where Jongwoo went, for example), but they are using a different source of funding, and none of the Kickstarter money will go to them. Speaking of which... \nWithout your help, we don't know when Boyfriend Dungeon will happen or when we can finish the game as it demands. Plus, with this campaign, we can add the cat as a weapon and make all of the dates, dungeons, and everything in between as polished, beautiful, and amazing as they can be. \nWe loved the input we got from Moon Hunters backers, but we felt like we didn't use it enough because we weren't ready for all of your ideas! So we want your feedback to help us shape the game in the years to come.\nWe\u2019re going to be especially interested in feedback on:  \nBalancing and pacing  \nCharacter story arcs & tone/content \nNew item/equipment ideas\nAlthough early beta-testers (from CAD$35+) will have the opportunity to give the most hands-on feedback experience with us, we will post regular updates to Kickstarter, and all backers\u2019 comments will be welcomed and shared among the team.  \nPLUS we wanted to make some unique limited-edition merch and pre-ordering those mugs and t-shirts and pillow cases makes it easier for us to see how many to make. :)  \nPlease back us so that we can get your input, and also deliver sweet merch to sweet people.\nWe\u2019ve already been working on Boyfriend Dungeon for over a year! But this Kickstarter helps us understand how many fans are out there, and how much we can afford to keep pouring our hearts (and wallets) into it.  \nThis is roughly how we will split up the funds:\nAnd, with your help, we not only reached our goal... we reached all of our stretch goals! So we decided to stop scoping up, past $200k, and make the game the best it can be, with the features and content we are already planning. Thank you so much for believing in us!\nOur current language support plans include only English, French, and Japanese, due to the amount of words. We may consider others, depending on community involvement.\nAs for the development schedule, we\u2019re currently in the midst of production that we hope will finish next year, but we will work with Indiebox to mail your physical rewards as soon as we can, even before the game releases.\nThanks for all of your excitement, enthusiasm, and support. If you can't afford to buy the game, we understand.. but please tell any friends or acquaintances you might have that CAN -- every dollar and/or wishlist helps.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nKitfox Games is an award-winning studio that has released multiple games, including successfully releasing a Kickstarted game previously (Moon Hunters).

You can still preorder some of the physical rewards in my shop for a limited time!\nClick here to visit the shop!\nThe crystal Kingdom of Chalcedonia was once a beautiful place, under the rule of the Princess Rosalia, they lived happy peaceful lives. Until one day, monsters called Nightmares destroyed the kingdom. Princess Rosalia and her fairy knight, Diana hid deep in the castle. Praying that their last hope, the magical Rose Crystal Mirror would produce a miracle and save their home. However, they were attacked by the leader of the Nightmare Agency, Druzy. Diana fought helplessly before finding herself transported Earth, but her Princess was no where to be seen.  \nUnfortunately the nightmares began to attack this new world too. Valerie Amaranth, an ordinary 16 year old, has her world changed forever when she receives the powers of the Legendary Crystal Warrior Diamond Heart. Now with the help of Diana, she must find her allies, defeat the Nightmares, and rescue the missing princess Rosalia.   \nGenre: Romance, Fantasy, Magical Girl, Comedy, Action\nMagical Warrior Diamond Heart is an in-progress otome visual novel created by Pyonkotchi. This game is inspired by magical girl anime and The full game will contain 14 episodes for the common route. The game features a diverse cast of characters from varying racial and ethnic backgrounds and LGBT dating options.   \nScreenshots from the demo. Click to enlarge!\nPlay as Valerie Amaranth and decide the fate of the world, eat delicious donuts, and even smooch lots of cuties! Will Val defeat the Nightmares, make new friends, and perhaps find the love of her life along the way? Or will she meet her tragic end? Your choices decide her fate and the fate of humanity in this magical visual novel!\nThe free-to-play version of the game will have\nFOUR adorable and distinct characters to smooch (Sophie, Ethan, Zacharie, and Opal)\nA friendship route with the fairy Amber if you'd rather not smooch anyone at all!\nMale, female, and a nonbinary love interest to pursue.\nDozens of beautifully illustrated original artworks\n200k+ words of content!\nThe Deluxe version of the game will have all of that and \nEven more adorable characters to smooch! (Alex, Liam, Clover, Chandra, and Diana) for a total of nine romance routes\nEven more artwork!\nExtra content for the F2P routes!\nUp to 400k words of content!\nPartial english voice acting from a very talented voice cast!\nhttps://pyonkotchi.itch.io/mwdh-demo\nClick here to view full profiles!\n                     CV: Anairis Quinones\n     CV: Sarah Ruth Thomas\nCV: Dani Chambers\nCV: Penelope Sophia Smith\nCV: Sandra Espinoza\nCV: Stephen J.

Gomez, Onyx - Joshua Galvan, Labra - Marissa Lenti, Chrys - Adoxographyst\nAnd More!!\nBy crowdfunding MWDH, I will be able to afford additional assets and partial voice acting for the game! \nI will also be able to dedicate more time toward art and writing for the game and hire assistants to speed up the process! Hopefully leading to a much more polished game in a shorter amount of time. Because this project has become so big, crowdfunding the game will also make it possible for a F2P version to exist so that everyone can experience a full playthrough of the game.\nWhere is my money going?\n\u2764 Art Assets and Writing: A large chunk of the funding is going toward Art creation. Background commissions, and hiring assistants to help with artwork. \nDespite being a one man team, I will be paying myself for writing. Why? Paying myself fairly as well ensures that I can spend more time on the project without worry. this money will also count as contingency/safety net money. if something goes wrong or if I need extra for certain assets, this money can help pay for it.\n\u2764 Voice Acting: another chunk of the games funding is going toward voice talent! Hiring talented voice acting costs a lot of money! This game will be partially voiced. Why only partial? It would be extremely irresponsible and unwise to fund voice acting without a complete wordcount of the game!\n\u2764 Programming: a lot of the basic programming has already been done for the demo! But since i am not a coder i will be hiring an experienced programmer in order to make the game more polished, run smoothly, and help me out with the work that has already been completed.\n\u2764 Music: Several tracks will be commissioned by a talented composer to make the sound of the game just as magical as the story! \n\u2764 Kickstarter Rewards and Goodies: Unfortunatley merch doesn't grow on trees! In order to pay for the rewards some money would need to go toward it as well!\n\u2764 Kickstarter fees: Kickstarter takes about 8-10% of the money earners for processing fees! \n6400 USD [REACHED!!!]\nAs of right now everyone has one basic pose with multiple outfits, If I meet this stretch goal I will add a second pose to the heroes and villains.\n 6900 USD [REACHED!!!]\nThis stretch goal adds additional musical tracks to the game! The main heroes will get battle versions of their leitmotifs to make the game more rich!\n7900 USD [REACHED!!!]\nIf this goal is met I will add a romantic route for the nightmare agent, Opal to the Deluxe version of the game. The money will go toward additional art, writing, and voiced lines for Opal! \n\n 9100 USD [REACHED!!!]\nIn order to reduce the cost of the game, I prioritized the fantastical magical background art of Chalcedonia and related areas. If this goal is met, I'll be able to commission more original background art!\n\n 10,000 USD [REACHED!!!]\nRight now the fairies share a joint friendship route, but if this goal is met, I'll add in separate romance route in the DX version for Valerie's fairy partner, Diana! The money will go toward additional writing, art, and voiced lines for Diana! Opal's route will also become free-to-play if this goal is reached!\n\n\nI love goodies and so do you, there are 11 reward tiers to choose from! but be fast, because some of them are limited! \n\n\n2 USD\n\nThank you for pledging to the game!

I am the main writer for the game, the lead artist, character designer, and I also made the logo and GUI. I'm a full-time college student and a freelance artist, as you can imagine that makes me quite a bit busy! Despite this I'm pretty much hopelessly devoted to this project <3 You can find me on Twitter and Tumblr, and email me at XereghaL@gmail.com for general inquiries and DiamondHeartVN@gmail.com for MWDH related questions!\n\nI came up with the concept in 2014, back then it was a smaller scale project meant to be a NaNoRenO game, but it has grown far beyond my imagination since then <3 I have dabbled in Ren'Py before but this will be my first full fledged release (Liam goes to snurch doesn't count!). \n\nI have been working on the game alone for the past few years, but now there are many talented people who help and support me make the game become much more magical than it ever was before! \nSome of the people who help with the project are:\n\nDiamond - Co-Writer, Idea bouncer\nRenaHeart - Art Assistant\nMochiskii - Art Assistant\nRaka - Background Artist\nTea Marie - Music\nTellerFarsight - Programming\nAnd the incredibly talented cast of voice actors <3", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe initial demo for Magical Warrior Diamond Heart was released in 2014 by a single person team, since then there has been many updates to the game, story, and character design and artwork, since then there has been many bumps in the road toward its development.\n\nThe biggest challenge that will come from development is that the game is being made by one person who is a full time college student. While many friends and generous people help out with the project, the writing is being done by a single person which will and has made progress a bit slow.\n\nHowever, Magical Warrior Diamond Heart is a passion project to the core. Despite hardships, family emergencies and tragedies, and college stress, work on the game has never stopped. I have never once considered dropping it, and I am confident that the game will be finished, and if any complications arise, all backers and supporters will be informed ASAP.\n\nIf unfortunately, the game does not receive funding, this will not stop the game from being made, however it will be a smaller scale project and wont fully reflect the true vision of the story.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 2 or more", "title": "\u2764 Fairy Knight \u2764", "descp": "Thank you for your support!

This is the home of the world\u2019s most subversive hacking collective inventively exposing the gluttonous feast on natural resources from belly of the beast using the gutsiest platform takeovers in the history of a mystery: Who is the MartyrLoserKing? \nMorgan Sorne for MartyrLoserKing (:01 2019)\nWhile Western intelligence looks to the usual suspects, a Dogon avatar whispers through a dream to reveal the coded mysteries of Sirius and the stars to an escaped coltan miner and an intersex runaway seeking refuge from a binary norm, revealing her divine circuitry as the eye of the storm. When their connection sparks the MartyrLoserKing is born.\nEric OneKey as Potolo & Kaya Free as Matalusa\nMartyrLoserKing, the elusive African hacker whose team of \u201closers\u201d and outcasts ignite the imagination of the world\u2019s most \u201cconnected\u201d generation through deep space, deep web penetration. A virtual hero for a world caught in perpetual analogue exploitation. Neptune Frost is the MartyrLoserKing.\nCheryl Isheja as Neptune Frost\nThe pitch\nWe put our energy into everything we touch, everything we focus on, and maybe even into the things we ignore, but conscious energy is an investment. It's what some mean when they type \u201cthoughts and prayers\u201d. Many artists embed and charge their creations with \"thoughts and prayers\", an energy you feel when it reaches you. Maybe it unlocks something. Perhaps it's the sincerity of the artist emitting a frequency that couples with our own to heal or release the moment. Maybe the beat or melody offers something unsaid, a sensation we never knew we had or needed touched. Maybe it does nothing, just like typing \u201cthoughts and prayers,\" but that data holds space. It holds the space for us to be moved beyond convention, to experience and explore new stories, maybe even other forms of storytelling.\nI wrote a story that I think demystifies the connection, that highlights technology as awareness, that shatters convention and honors the means through which this conversation is taking place. And for me, you are the most precious of resources. You hold the power to fuel a dream and a transformation. You can shake the industry of imagination with a thought (and a prayer). You have masterminded revolutions and shifts in power with more than weapons. You have eulogized tyrants with self-satisfied smirks. Try something that works.\nHelp me fuck shit up. With beauty.\nClub Himbaza- Burundian refugee drummers\nKaya Free as Matalusa\nCheryl Isheja & Eric Onekey/Neptune & Potolo\nHow many longwinded pitches would it take to convince large-scale investors that a story that takes place in a little-known country, with rebellious and anti-establishment themes, that draws inspiration from many socio-political movements happening today, should be left in the hands of a poet, who isn't interested in making films by committee, who has more critical acclaim than sales, who has never directed a film, who dreams to \u201cspark the brain that will change the world\u201d, who thinks the formulaic aesthetic that births reality stars and super-heroes alike takes it's cues from a cultural mythos that is more invested in the bottom line than illuminating the rut at the bottom, who thinks the bottom is the top, who sees each high-priced tick in the stock market in association with the African country where the commodity is sourced then marks its ranking on the list of poorest nations, who thinks \u201cWait a minute. If it's that rich in resources, then how...\u201d but knows the answer, who sees how power corrupts and obstructs, who isn't interested in disaster and poverty porn, who thinks it's a kind of colonial projection when dreams of distant galaxies are embedded with fears of being colonized by aliens, who thinks the internet, like poetry, is undefeated, who thinks the job of the poet is to decode, who calculates algorithmic swagger by those who don't follow, who knows the connection was there before the machine, who has never truly danced in a movie theater and thinks it's a shame, who knows each rhythm tells a story, who has a story to tell... How many longwinded pitches would it take? Asking for a friend.\nRonald Wimberly for MartyrLoserKing\nI began working on this project as a graphic novel and a musical. I wanted to center my writing around the social and global issues flooding my actual and virtual timelines and their countless intersections through a story, character, and project that would allow me to focus all of my observations, insights, rants, and talents under one heading. \nI pitched the graphic novel to Mark Seigel at :01First Second Books and he jumped on board immediately along with illustrator, Ronald Wimberly and illustrator/visual artist/musician Morgan Sorne. I played the first musical ideas for my ally Jon Cohen at Fader and had no problem garnering support. I pitched the play and got help from Anisia Uzeyman and the BANFF Centre in Canada to write it and then Kamilah Forbes at HI-ARTS (NYC) to workshop it. From there, after speaking with a few producers, the idea slowly evolved into a film. Sol Guy and Tribeca Films offered a small team for me to experiment with some ideas on camera. Stephen Hendel, producer of Fela!, offered his support for us to shoot this trailer, which we filmed in Rwanda with an entirely Rwandan and Burundian cast and crew. \nPLAY\n\nNow I'm turning to you.\non set: Lake Muhazi, Rwanda\nAll funds will go to the filming of Neptune Frost.\nAs a way of thanking you for your support here's a new song!The Flaw You Worship (prod. by Orko Eloheim)\nTEAM", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis project wouldn't be shit without the music. Music is the door hidden within each door. It's how I met Stephen Hendel, the producer I've teamed with to make sure this film gets made. Essentially, he'll raise what I don't. I'm asking for a fraction of the budget to get the ball rolling, because it's time. In these days it's a strange experience to build up loads of content and not share it. Writing the graphic novel has been that experience. I'm excited to finally be at the point of sharing more of the story with you. Writing the music has written the story. My love of music and theater are as separate as they are together, but musical theater in film and on stage has left it's mark on me. I went to see Sarafina on Broadway seven times. The mix of raw politics, story-telling and music was everything, Those actors risked being exiled from their country and separated from their families for daring to perform truth to power. I was transfixed. I began writing my first musical for film when I was sixteen and living in Brazil as an exchange student. It was actually a mix-tape musical, 'though I referred to it as a \"hipopera\". Corny, I know, but I was sixteen. The MartyrLoserKing project has three albums (MartyrLoserKing : Neptune Frost : Unanimous Goldmine). Each album contains songs from and inspired by the musical. The graphic novel is from the perspective of the coltan miner, The film is from the perspective of Neptune. Ok, enough already. What's the risk? Maya Angelou once said that anything an artist writes should be written with the urgency of what they would write if someone were holding a gun in their mouth. The state of this country and the world has my mouth propped open enough to swallow whole timelines. We need art that is unafraid to challenge the narrative structure of our programming. Computational propaganda circulates at the speed of colonial diseases through indigenous populations. Music is a time-machine. What's the risk? Ask Carlo Rovelli.\n\nShout out Indigo Impact for helping us bring this campaign to life!\n\nAnd I'd like to thank my wonderful cast & crew for the trailer.\n\nCheryl Isheja\nKaya Free\nEric OneKey\nNatacha Muziramakenga\nGael Faye\nTresor Niyongabo\nClub Himbaza\n\nDirector : Saul Williams Director of photography : Anisia Uzeyman\nAssistant DP : Fabrice Mugisha\nCostume Design : Cedric Mizero \nProducer : Jean Maurice Kabuguza\nRwanda Coordinator : Florentine Kabasinga\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Choo Choo Bird", "descp": "An invisible North African kitten named Choo Choo Bird who will visit you in your dreams once every blue moon.

They are experiments only brought to completion through the act of deciding to share them with you. From my hard drive to yours.

Not in The Good Life! This game is made for you!\nPlay as Naomi, a journalist from New York who moves to a backwoods British town called Rainy Woods in order to pay off her massive debt.\nThe only way for her to escape from debt hell is to take pictures of happenings in the town and report on them. Of course, 'the happiest town in the world' is not your average town...  \nThe inhabitants of the happiest town in the world are some of the most bizarre people you'll ever come across. You'll live alongside them as you solve mysteries and experience a hearty helping of craziness. We're sure that you'll eventually come to love all the mystery, horror, and good old charm that this town has to offer.\n\nDownload from the link below\n\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1wkbB1bNsht-EVkiyvfxdYumbZGIwmuTW/view?usp=sharing\n\nThe Good Life Prototype Demo, Available Now!\nRead Update 24 for all the instructions\nThe main character of this game is a female New Yorker named Naomi. In order to pay off her debt, she took a job from a newspaper company in NY and moved to the 'happiest town in the world.' This game chronicles all the bizarre things she experiences during her time in the town.\n A completely new 'daily life action-adventure game' with a slow life that isn't actually slow!\n In this game, the player has two main goals: \n1. Pay off your debt with money you earn from doing photography jobs in the town.\n\n2. Solve the mystery of the murder that took place in the 'happiest town in the world.'\nThe townspeople are also hiding a big secret...\n In the moonlight, all the townspeople suddenly transform... And suddenly, the town is filled with cats and dogs!\nOnce a month, everyone who lives there transforms into either a cat or a dog.\nNaturally, Naomi and the player will also turn into a cat or a dog.\nYou'll be able to select whether you want to transform into a cat or a dog at the very beginning. But if you get far enough in the story, you may reach a point where you can freely switch between them...?\nWhat happens in the town depends entirely on you!\nHow the townspeople behave, how their lives play out, and how the story ends... It'll all change based on your decisions.\n(How you interact with the townspeople and make friends with them will change how they think and behave.)\nThe townspeople's relationships will change based on how you play. In one town, you may see a surprising couple start dating... Or a normal character in your town may become the mayor of your friend's town...\nYou may even be able to influence how the story in your town plays out!\nThe story will eventually lead its main character (you) to a shocking truth...\nAs a journalist, your job is to take photographs as you live out your life in the town.\nYou can take photos of anyone, anywhere, then later post those photos on a photo app or sell them to a newspaper company for money.\nAll you need to do is frame your subjects! The abilities of your equipment will determine the overall quality.\nThis means that in order to take good pictures, you'll need to acquire a lot of different tools!\nBut first, you'll need to make a lot of money...  \nIn order to pay off your debt, in order to buy good equipment, in order to enjoy yourself, in order to quench your thirst for fashion...\nIn order to enjoy your life in Rainy Woods to the fullest, you'll need to take every chance you can to earn some extra cash!\nMake money with your photos!\n There are two ways for you to turn your photographs into money.\nThe first is to use the in-game SNS photo app \"Flamingo.\"\nUnlike Instagram, you can earn advertising profits for each \"Like\" your photos get.\nAll you need to do is upload them!\nChoose photos that best capture the seasons, add fun filters to your animal shots, or create a charming portrait.\nChoose photos that you think will get the most buzz on Flamingo and rack up the Likes!\nThe other way is to sell your photos to Morningvale, a newspaper company.\nPhotographs connected to the town's secrets will yield great rewards. What are the townspeople hiding...?\nSince Naomi's debt is connected to Morningvale, all the money you earn through them will only be used to pay it off.\nMake even more money with various part-time jobs!\n What do you think of when you hear the word 'countryside?' Gathering bugs and fruit? No, we're tired of all that! Shear sheep, deliver milk, make jam and hay, do some gardening, or work as a bartender, a casino dealer, a miner, or even mine for cryptocurrency if you want to! Enjoy some part-time jobs that are really 'out there' and give your country life a little mature flavor!\nBlow all the money you've earned on whatever you want!\n You can use the money you earn to pay off your debt and buy new camera equipment, but sometimes, it's good just to blow it on something fun!\nGo out for a drink, buy an expensive brand item, enjoy some afternoon tea, start an antique furniture collection...\nDon't forget to reward yourself for working hard!\nEnjoy the changes in time and season!\nThis is an open-world game centered around a rural English town. Naturally, the time and seasons will run on their own in-game clock. There will be special photos that you can only take in certain seasons which can be sold for lots of money, and we want traditional English events to appear in their proper seasons. Of course, classic events such as Halloween, Christmas, Valentine's Day, and Easter are also being considered! Aside from events, you can test your luck in other ways such as journeying into mines to discover valuable ore veins, fishing your heart out, or harvesting a field of crops.\nEnjoy fashion!\n You can use money to give Naomi some style! Try on different outfits and pick the look you like best. Some clothes might even boost Naomi's parameters...\nYou need to take good care of yourself!\nThis game contains various parameters. For example, life, stamina, hunger, sleepiness, inebriation, beauty care... And for Naomi, a native to one of the world's most cutting edge cities, beauty care is super important!\nMake sure you don't forget to give yourself some special care every morning and every evening. Otherwise, you'll lose your feminine charm and end up as a filthy flytrap!\nOnce per month, you can enjoy the limitless freedom that only cats and dogs get to experience.\nTurn into a cat and climb up to high places, scratch walls, and steal fish and chips from kitchens... Or turn into a dog and dig holes, follow scents, and swim in rivers and lakes... It only happens once a month, so make sure you enjoy it to your heart's content!\nCat/dog mystery solving image\nUse your telescope lens to snap shots of targets in areas you can reach as a cat, or get up close to them as a dog and try to acquire the perfect scoop for a scandal photograph. There are some mysteries that only animals can solve! When you turn into one, you'll be able to do new things and adventure into new places.\nFrom the very beginning, we have been very careful about focusing on the one goal that really matters, and that\u2019s getting the campaign funded.\nWe had made plans for Stretch Goals, though. We put together two plans, one in case the campaign was incredibly successful very fast, and another plan in case the campaign got funded a few weeks in. We also knew there was a chance the campaign would only get funded at the last minute, which ended up the case. We didn\u2019t talk about the other alternative, because we believe in the campaign.\nAnyhow, we want to address Stretch Goals in case we do get funded and you want to know what the extra funds will go towards.\nWe had a long meeting today about this, and we kept coming back to the one thing that we have been asked the most throughout the campaign: bringing The Good Life to the Nintendo Switch.\n\nEven though, as you know, our lead programmer has started to play with the console devkit, we know that this will be a costly endeavour and we don\u2019t want to mess up our budget.\n\nWe have set a unique Stretch Goal at JPY 88,000,000 - bringing The Good Life to the Nintendo Switch\n\nOf course, we know this is a very high Stretch Goal, and considering the way the campaign is going, it is very much possible we are not going to reach it, so let me explain our reasoning.\nWe could have set up more stretch goals, adding content to the game, and help them build up towards the Switch Stretch Goal. However, as each of this smaller goal comes with a cost, they would have set the Switch Stretch Goal even further, making it meaningless, and upsetting the numerous fans who have been asking for the Switch port.\nWe could have set up those smaller game content stretch goals, and not mention the Switch Stretch Goal, but as I mentioned, this is by far the number one request I have received during the campaign, and not addressing it seems bad.\n\nSo, we decided to aim high - go for one single ambitious stretch goal, the most requested addition to the campaign.\n\nBUT.\n\nIf we do get funded and we miss the Stretch Goal, we will use the extra funds towards additional content for the game and we will share what these are with you in a post campaign update. To give you an idea, we are considering things like adding more music tracks, adding more seasonal events to Rainy Woods, creating more part time jobs/revenue generating activities for Naomi to repay her crippling debt, more outfits for our intrepid photographer, and so on.\nThis way you know that whatever happens, you are building towards a better game.\n\nWhat happens to the Nintendo Switch version if we miss the Stretch Goal?\nWe really, really want to make a Switch version. Any game developer these days is excited about this console. I would love to see fans playing The Good Life on the go, on the train. However, I also want to make The Good Life, and for this, we need to be very careful with our budget, and have a clear focus.\nIf we miss the Stretch Goal, I will work very hard to find an alternative way to get the Nintendo Switch version to happen, but we are not making it a promise to you. And the moment we know we can make it, you will be the first to be informed.\n\nWhat about collecting funds after the campaign to go toward the Switch Stretch Goal?\n\nWe discussed this, and as you will see in the next part of the update, we are planning for a way to collect some extra funds after the campaign. However, I know other Kickstarter campaigns have run late backers campaigns in a way where they have set those extra funds to complete more Stretch Goals.\nI think this is admirable and brave, but for The Good Life, we want to be able to really focus on our initial game, and work really hard towards it as soon as possible. The idea of having Stretch Goals indefinitely opened after the end of the campaign is quite scary, it gives us a moving target, harder to hit.\nFor this reason, we are only looking at the funds gathered during the campaign for the Stretch Goals. I believe it will lead to a better focus on our part, and a better game in the end for you all, and I hope you can support that decision and that philosophy.\n \u201cDEADLY PREMONITION DEVELOPER ANNOUNCES NEW GAME, THE GOOD LIFE \u201d\n- IGN  \n \u201cDeadly Premonition creator\u2019s next game is a cat RPG\u201d\n- Polygon  \n \u201cDeadly Premonition director Swery announces RPG about people who turn into cats\u201d\n- Eurogamer\nShipping Information\nIn order to keep costs as fair as possible and to avoid those costs to count towards our goals, we are planning to use a pledge manager (like BackerKit) to handle the shipping costs. Shipping costs will reflect the actual cost to ship your pledge. They will be charged to you when the items are ready to be sent, after the game has launched.\nBackerKit confirmed for our pledge manager\nWe are very happy to be able to confirm that we will use BackerKit to manage the pledges after the campaign. If you are not familiar with BackerKit, they are a company specialised in supporting the logistical side of crowdfunding campaigns.\nIt will allow us to more efficiently manage the surveys, and make sure we collect the right amount for the shipping costs if you have a physical reward that needs to be sent to you.\nNow, BackerKit also allows us to do a few extra things that are interesting. We can run a late backers campaign with them - we are still figuring things out about this and we might do one. But more importantly, we do know that we will allow our Kickstarter backers to purchase additional items from the campaign. In order for you to be able to plan which tier is best to pledge for, we want to let you know now about items that we have confirmed will be accessible to our backers on BackerKit, and their prices.\nPlease note that the listed prices (just like the campaign rewards) do not include the shipping costs:\n\u30fbThe Good Life T-Shirt. $40\n\u30fbThe Good Life Hoodie. $95\n\u30fbThe Good Life Mug. $20\n\u30fbDigital Copy of the game on PC. $30\n\u30fbDigital Copy of the game on PS4. $40\nWe haven\u2019t confirmed the other items - especially the Collector\u2019s Edition box. The current CE box has an exclusive design for the Kickstarter campaign, but we know that there will be a Limited Run version available at some point as well, and it might mean we won\u2019t offer the Kickstarter exclusive box on BackerKit.\nIf you have already backed The Good Life and put money beyond the reward tier that you have selected, please note that you will be able to use those extra funds towards these extra items.\nAnd if you already know you want one those items, of course, you can increase your pledge accordingly, just make sure you stay at the reward tier that you want. For instance, if you want the Joyful Life Tier (about $50), but are interested in getting the T-Shirt, you can pledge $90, and keep your pledge at the Joyful Life Tier.\nThe Good Life - Physical Collector's Edition\nHere are the contents of the Physical Collector's Edition.\nIt's going to be filled with a lot of high quality items produced by Limited Run, a company known for its great work on countless physical editions so far! Here is a list of everything that will be a part of the set!\nThe Good Life Physical Collector's Edition Contents:\n- Kickstarter Exclusive Box (Embossed, with a completely unique design)\n- Physical Game Disc (your choice of a PS4 or a PC version; PC version comes with a Steam key)\n- Post Card (Scenery of Rainy Woods)\n- Post Card (Letter from Team With SWERY's & Mr. Futatsugi's Signatures)\n- Rainy Woods Tourist Guide Leaflet (A4 size, tri-fold)\n- Artbook (A bit smaller than A5)\n- Trading Cards (Characters / Dogs / Cats)\n- Soundtrack CD\n\nRewards description and USD prices\nBelow you can find a summary of all the rewards, along an estimate of their price in US Dollars. The campaign is in Japanese Yen, those prices below are purely a guideline for the price range. As currency exchange rates can vary, we recommend you check on a dedicated website to have an up-to-date price of the rewards.\n I'm SWERY, the director of The Good Life.\nThe Good Life is my \"dream game\". I've been thinking about it for a very long time, and was finally blessed with a chance to develop it thanks to my powerful partners - and you, of course. Please join in on our project and help us make my dream game into EVERYONE'S dream game! I Love You All!\n I'm Futatsugi, from G-rounding. A long time ago, I used to believe that games had magic in them. A new game always brought me a brand new experience, and excitement as to what would happen next. Crazy things would happen, and it felt really like I had fallen under some sort of spell. But lately, the risks involved in creating new games have gotten more and more extreme, and it's becoming harder and harder to make magic games. SWERY and I want to bring that magic back - but we need to borrow a little mana from you in order to summon it. We want to show the world a kind of magic it's never seen.\n I'm Hotta, the art director. When I first heard about The Good Life, I was deeply drawn in by atmosphere (a personal favorite style of mine) and the direction its art style was heading in. I'm so excited to start working on it. After working hard on the art direction, we've finally arrived at the style that I always hoped we would eventually reach! I'm going to put 120% of all I've got into this, while enjoying the chemical reactions that ensue between the art style, the atmosphere, and SWERY!\nI first met Swery in 2013, I think. We immediately hit it off, and always met up whenever I went to Japan and whenever he came to America. We quickly became good enough friends to have long, deep talks about the future together. When he released the amazing D4, we collaborated with him and performed the soundtrack live, but this time with The Good Life, we've received the chance to work with him on an even deeper level - actually creating the music itself. Orchestral music, band rock, and excellent singing are all important elements of the VGO, so we intend to supply you all with some Sweryism music that only we can create. We'll be posting some demos later, so please check them out!\nUnity\nWhite Owls has an idea for a fun game. G-rounding has the skill and the experience to create it. However, we don't possess the funds to push this project forward.\nSince 2010, the methods by which games are created have been changing rapidly. Through the proliferation of various game engines, virtually anyone can make their own game now as long as they set up the proper environment for it. Indie games have risen, multiple digital distribution platforms have become well-established, and new platforms such as VR have entered the fray. Due to these reasons and more, we game creators must adapt to many changes in order to survive. \nThis is especially true when it comes to gathering funds. The method to gather funds known as crowdfunding is now available to us. We no longer have to narrow in on our target and pitch an idea to a single investor in the hopes of possibly receiving a large amount of funds. Instead, it's becoming more and more common for game creators to pitch their ideas directly to their audience and gather funds that way.\nThe truth is that even in this day and age, most Japanese game creators still gather funds using the traditional method. But this method will never allow a creator to truly own their work and let it be their identity while also knowing that it will be able to support them their future -- two things that Western creators adopting newer methods have managed to achieve. In Japan, copyrights always belong to the investors, which includes not only the profits from those rights, but also the rights to create continuations using the same IPs.\nThat's why we want to take the awesome concept behind The Good Life and use our skill to build it on equal footing with our investors. After thinking long and hard about what our best course of action would be, we decided to adopt a hybrid model that allows us to push forth the project with both funds from partners and crowdfunding together.\nOur plan is to gather a portion of the necessary funds for our project from this campaign. Currently, we're already negotiating with several partners about this project, and we hope that successfully completing this campaign will bring The Good Life closer to perfection in the end.\nMany game creators narrow in on their target, alter their project scope and change their game ideas in order to gain a large amount of funds from a single investor. But what if all those game creators could take their awesome ideas as-is and simply propose them straight to their players?\nCrowdfunding makes this possible.We think The Good Life is an amazing idea, and will lead to a game that will be wholeheartedly accepted once it's completed. We want to prove this, with help from our supporters.\n*We created a pie chart that exhibits the funding ratio between crowdfunding and partners.\nUNTIES\n Limited Run\n Video Game Orchestra\nMEGA64 \nWe may add more allies in the future, so keep your eyes peeled in the updates!\nLast Autumn, we learned a lot thanks to our first campaign. We feel our biggest shortcoming was our inability to provide to our supporters a solid guarantee that we would complete the game no matter what.\nTherefore, we decided to reboot our project only after finding a powerful partner and getting proper guarantees in order to ensure that we would be able to deliver The Good Life to you all.\nBy teaming up with UNTIES, the new indie game label from Sony Music Entertainment, we will now be able to plan everything from the very beginning. The schedule up to the delivery of the product, localization, quality control, and making sure everyone around the world gets to join in.\nWe believe that this partnership guarantees that The Good Life project will reach completion.\nWhile The Good Life now has strong partners associated with it, the project still has a long way to go and has to prove itself in many ways.\nIn the same manner, White Owls is a young company, even though I, SWERY, have been making games for a while. The crowdfunding campaign is a good way for us to start relationships with our partners on a strong foot, where they feel confident that the game will be great, and my team and I have a strong understanding of what will make the game amazing for our fans.\nG-rounding has the history and more than enough power to develop the game, and partners have the marketing networks and the funds to release our game on a worldwide scale, but White Owls only has SWERY and the original idea for the project.\nThat's why I (SWERY) want to invite all our supporters to help us show the world the value of White Owls and The Good Life. If we can gather a part of the funds through crowdfunding and prove that White Owls and The Good Life has a strong appeal, we feel we will truly be able to push this project forward with far more power than we'd otherwise have on our own.\nIn other words, in order to create the best project centered around SWERY, we need much more than funds from a partner - we need to gather support (financial but also moral) through a crowdfunding campaign as well.\n\"But White Owls has SWERY. Isn't that enough?\" To all my fans and supporters out there who may be thinking something like this, I'm truly grateful. But the hard truth is that those feelings alone are not enough to create an entire game. We want to prove that White Owls is a development studio worth supporting, so please, lend us your help!\nWe want all our supporters to join this project from the very beginning so that everyone can carry an equal voice and equal responsibility. Let's work together to build The Good Life into the best game it can possibly be!!\nI Love You All!!  \nSWERY \n SWERY/WhiteOwls.inc                                     Twitter - Facebook - Instagrm - Webpage\nG-rounding.inc                                                                        Twitter - Facebook - Webpage\nCopyright \u00a9 2018 White Owls Inc. All rights reserved.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\n\u25bcHigh volume\nSince this game is based around a rural town in England, we\u2019re going to need to make different environments and build events into them. With games like The Good Life, the fun factor is proportionate to the number of different events, so we need to try and put in as many events as we can and also create a variety of areas for them to happen in. This will cost us, and depending on how things go, we may not be able to include all the events we want to.\n\n[Solution]\nWe\u2019ve decided to create multiple plans for the game volume based on how much funding we end up getting. With the lowest volume plan, players will still be able to enjoy a mysterious story, take pictures and earn money, communicate with villagers, and enjoy life in a rural town. On top of that, we\u2019ll also create a schedule for building peripheral elements such as decorations so that the game development will never come to a standstill due to monetary problems. Our staff members have been in the game industry for over 20 years, so we know how to strictly control our schedules.\n\n\u25bcControlling a large number of characters is difficult\nIn this game, we\u2019ll turn characters\u2019 desires, habits, goals, preferences, and invitations to one another into parameters for an autonomous system that controls their actions within the game. This is the first time we\u2019ve tried something like this, but if we manage to complete it, we\u2019ll be able to freely add a ton of variety to the game. The risk is that we won\u2019t know whether or not we can really pull this off until we give it a try.\n\n[Solution]\nIn the end, if we can\u2019t figure out a way to pull it off, we\u2019ll control the NPCs using the same method we used in Deadly Premonition. We can create an enhanced version of that system, which has already been successful once, in order to greatly lower our risk of failure.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a5100 or more", "title": "Moral Support Tier", "descp": "INCLUDES:\nFollow THE GOOD LIFE campaign and receive updates!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2019"}], "stat": ["388 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a51,500 or more", "title": "The Good Music Tier", "descp": "INCLUDES:\nFollow THE GOOD LIFE campaign and receive updates!\nDigital OST (lossless format)\n4 Digital Desktop Wallpapers of various resolutions", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2019"}], "stat": ["167 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a53,000 or more", "title": "The Good Life on PC Tier", "descp": "INCLUDES:\nFollow THE GOOD LIFE campaign and receive updates!\nThe game on PC (digital version).\nNamed in the credits in the \u201cGood Person\u201d list.\n4 Digital Desktop Wallpapers of various resolutions\nNaomi alternative outfit (Good Life outfit)", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2019"}], "stat": ["4,157 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a53,500 or more", "title": "EARLY BIRD The Good Life on PS4 Tier", "descp": "INCLUDES:\nFollow THE GOOD LIFE campaign and receive updates!\nThe game on PS4 (digital version).\nNamed in the credits in the \u201cGood Person\u201d list.\n4 Digital Desktop Wallpapers of various resolutions\nNaomi alternative outfit (Good Life outfit)", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2019"}], "stat": ["799 backers", "Limited (1 left of 800)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a54,000 or more", "title": "The Good Life on PS4 Tier", "descp": "INCLUDES:\nFollow THE GOOD LIFE campaign and receive updates!\nThe game on PS4 (digital version).\nNamed in the credits in the \u201cGood Person\u201d list.\n4 Digital Desktop Wallpapers of various resolutions\nNaomi alternative outfit (Good Life outfit)", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2019"}], "stat": ["1,307 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a55,000 or more", "title": "The Joyful Life Tier", "descp": "INCLUDES:\nFollow THE GOOD LIFE campaign and receive updates!\nThe game on PC or PS4 (digital version)\nNamed in the credits in the \u201cJoyful Person\u201d list\nDigital OST (lossless format)\nDigital Storyline Overview (PDF)\nDigital concept art portfolio (PDF)\n4 Digital Desktop Wallpapers of various resolutions\nNaomi alternative outfit (Good Life outfit)", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2019"}], "stat": ["1,783 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a58,000 or more", "title": "The Double Life Tier", "descp": "INCLUDES:\nFollow THE GOOD LIFE campaign and receive updates!\nTwo copies of the game (PC or PS4; digital versions)\nNamed in the credits in the \u201cJoyful Person\u201d list\nDigital OST (lossless format)\nDigital Storyline Overview (PDF)\nDigital concept art portfolio (PDF)\n4 Digital Desktop Wallpapers of various resolutions\nNaomi alternative outfit (Good Life outfit)", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2019"}], "stat": ["240 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a513,000 or more", "title": "The Awesome Life Tier", "descp": "Shipping not included.

Help us create a powerful venue in which to explore them.\nLAAB #0: DARK MATTER will concern itself with mythological blackness, and black bodies in science fiction.  \nRon has recruited a cadre of bold thinkers, writers, artists, musicians, and genre-defiers to mine this rich territory. LAAB is their long-overdue soapbox, their stage, their megaphone, their clubhouse, and their launching pad \u2013 all in a mass-produced, widely accessible newspaper format that everyone can enjoy.\n The debut issue will be jam-packed with:  \nAn interview with musician and actor Saul Williams  \nA conversation with graphic artist Trenton Doyle Hancock \nJames Romberger on Jean-Michel Basquiat \nA discussion with the poster artist Alexandra Bell\nA critical analysis of George Lucas's THX 1138 \nRonald Wimberly's visual tribute to Sun Ra \nA review of BLACK, the new comic from Black Mask Studios  \nOver a dozen pages of comics and illustration by Ronald Wimberly\n...and much more!\nThis Kickstarter isn't just about making this first issue happen. A community forum deserves to be heard by every member of the community, and so part of our funding goal goes towards donating a minimum of 200 copies of LAAB to free public libraries around the country. For every $5,000 we raise above our funding goal of $30,000, we will increase that amount of freely donated copies by 100. That's about one donated copy for every two and a half copies sold.  \nWe're also offering a LOCAL HERO reward tier, which would enable a generous backer to donate 50 or more copies to an institution of their choosing.\nThis isn't just because we love libraries (though we certainly do). It's because LAAB's vision is incomplete if its ideas can't travel into every nook and cranny of our culture, and into every member of our community's hands.\nSTRETCH GOALS!\n$35,000: We will donate a total of 300 copies of LAAB to various free public libraries across the country.\n$40,000: CUSTOM BAGS!\nEvery copy of LAAB #0 will come in a custom made plastic bag, designed by Ronald Wimberly and Ma\u00eblle Doliveux.\n$45,000: We will donate a total of 500 copies of LAAB to free public libraries across the country.\n$50,000: LAAB PATCHES!\n2\" embroidered patches featuring the LAAB logo. Will look very slick on a hat, bag, jacket, or literally anywhere else.\n$60,000: FOUR NEW PAGES!\nWe will add FOUR piping hot pages of brand new content, bringing the length of the mag to 36 pages. \n$70,000: We will donate a total of 1,000 copies of LAAB to free public libraries across the country.\n$95,000: We will donate a total of 1,500 copies of LAAB to free public libraries across the country.\n$100,000: EIGHT NEW PAGES! \nWe will add EIGHT pages of fresh new content, increasing the total length of the mag to 40 full broadsheet pages.\nAnd so on.\nWe can't make this happen without you. \nOur mission at Beehive Books is to enable unusual projects by artists and thinkers we admire -- unique delivery systems for vital ideas and aesthetics. Ronald Wimberly and the diverse cast of talents he's assembled for this issue are the kinds of voices we need tackling the complex and charged issues the magazine will address. We need your help amplifying their signal, and broadcasting it all over the world. \nPlease become part of this campaign, and make LAAB MAGAZINE a reality.\nORIGINAL ART\nIn order to raise funds for LAAB MAGAZINE, Ronald is making a number of pieces of original artwork available for sale exclusively through this campaign.\nThis is a rare opportunity to own a handmade, one-of-a-kind piece of Wimberly artwork.

Along with his partners at Locust Moon, Josh published the Kickstarter-funded projects THE LOST WORK OF WILL EISNER and the Eisner and Harvey Award-winning anthology LITTLE NEMO: DREAM ANOTHER DREAM.

In this post apocalyptic world, your objective is to liberate creatures and wastelands through combat farming.\n      Your Own Farm! - Bring materials that you've found in worlds back to your own personal hub farm to grow crops.

There will be a DRM-Free download as well. \nPossible Platforms \n We grew up on bowls of cinnamon toast crunch, with a gaming console and CRT television in front of us. We still play my games like this and would love for others to enjoy this experience on more platforms. Mac, Linux, PS4, and Nintendo Switch are stretch goals we hope to reach as it takes time and resources to port them over correctly. \n                                                                                   No Limitations \nA few months before starting this game, I had been laid off from my industry gig. I moved out of my apartment into a room in an unfinished basement and I thought to myself \"What do I do now\"? I could get another gig, but why and what guarantee's my security there? It was that moment when God mentioned to me that I should develop a game with \"purpose\" that is edifying for the mind, body, and soul. A game that will inspire people like me to have hope when all odds are against them. My question to God was: How am I going to start a game company with only $200 to my name? My family is nowhere near wealthy, I have no type of inheritance, house I could sell or anything. God then advised me to start working on it and have faith that He would provide what was needed. So I did just that. I've been introduced to my teammates, granted with teaching gigs, and blessed with grant money up to about $10K to get the game to the point where it is now. \nIt took over 2 years to get the game to this point because I have been limited financially to finish it. I do not want to go to a publisher because I know a publisher will want us to release the game early on to rack in some profit from it. While getting profit is nice that is not why I am making this game. Money will do nothing for my spirit when I am dead. I believe our game has an impacting vision that I would love for you to experience. In order for this to happen I need to buy time and resources\nWe need your help in generating funds for this game to buy time for our team as we have already spent countless hours of free time working on this project. We have already made sacrifices while living on the bare minimum, but we do have living costs and can't starve while developing this game. We also need funds for operational costs as well as other important things needed to develop a video game. We believe in power in numbers and that this project can expand with no limitation through the gaming community itself. \n          Our studio is apart of The Maker Innovation Lab Lawrence which is a MakerSpace combining many disciplines for the ultimate collaboration. Developing our game within this community, we manage the game development/motion capture space in which The MILL is currently seeking equipment that will be available to businesses and anyone with a vision!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nDELAYS\n\nWhile developing the prototype of this game, three of my family members died within the course of less than three months. It was a tough time for me especially being the pallbearer at all three funerals. I didn't expect something like this to happen, but it did and I had no control over it. \n\nOn the journey to finishing this game we are sure that there will be plenty of unexpected punches in development and/or life that are going to hit really hard. You can't really plan for these type of punches, but when they did hit we've been able to get up every single time. I mean the game made it this far right? \n\nThat being said there are possibilities of delaying our release date. If we are baking a cake for you and the power shuts off ten minutes after putting it in the oven, we are not going to take out that undone cake, slap icing on it, and feed it to you. \n\nFINANCES\n\nAgain we DO NOT want to go to a publisher for the capital to finish this game. If we reach the initial funding goal and nothing more, then we will have to resort to additional funding from a publisher or investor to finish. Our game is currently in the prototype phase and $40K would get our game to a fully fleshed out alpha to secure a publisher. If we reach our higher stretch goals, this would enable us to fully develop Cede without any shackles attached like publishers controlling our vision.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "BareHand\n2 created \u00b7 9 backed\nOur philosophy is that no matter who you are, everyone has come to a point in life where a person must BareHand.

The game doesn't limit your play with goals or objectives; you're free to have open-ended fun while you play with your food, without the mess to clean up afterwards. You are presented with scenes full of ramen noodles, boba tea, popcorn, and you mash buttons at will to interact with the food in curious and unconventional ways.\n  \"I'm hungry\" - Most people who play this game\nIn addition to foods, the game will also feature food related contraptions, such as the MEAT GRINDER, toaster, and more to be revealed. \nNour is the only game on the market that will find you questioning the ethics of putting a hoverboard in a meat grinder.\nThe controls in Nour vary from scene to scene. How do you find out what each button does? Experiment! Mash any key on your keyboard during the game and you'll get immediate feedback, which you can use to discover combinations of interactions throughout each scene. \nThe game features the Razer Chroma SDK, so if you have one of those fancy Razer Keyboards, the LEDs on the device will respond to the game! \nNour can also be played with the Midi Fighter 3D by DJTechTools! The kinetically satisfying buttons on the controller will make for a very tactile experience. \nHave a midi controller sitting around? Nour will respond to just about any USB midi controller that sends note signals! \nFeatured on Polygon and DR\u00d8ME magazine \u2727\uff65\uff9f: *\u2727\uff65\uff9f:*\n\"Ah yes, I like my toast extra burnt.\" - Pixelpop 2017 player\n  \"Hey wanna get some boba tea after this?\" - Pixelpop 2017 player\n   Many more scenes for the game are in the works!\nBento Box\nSushi\ndog food\nBlender\nAvocado Toast\nboneless pizza\nDonuts (this scene is going to be very dramatic)\nmore to be announced!\nI've been working on this project off and on for the past couple years. The idea has changed quite a bit from the first time I started modeling food. \nIn retrospect, boba tea was the real catalyst for the project. After trying it for the first time, I was so inspired by the flavors and various colors that I decided to 3d model it, just as an interesting art challenge. \nA lot of my influence happens to come from Asian foods. After creating boba tea art I followed up to it after having a real nice steamy bowl of ramen. After showing the ramen scene to friends both in real life and on Twitter, the response was unanimous; about everyone I showed the scene to said the same thing: \"I'm hungry now.\" So I decided to explore this idea: \nWhat are the exact colors that elicit the response of hunger? \nAnd that set me on the mission to create high-fidelity, interactive food art. The first time I made an interactive version of the game, it was controlled completely by keyboard: \n  Around that time, my pal Keiko introduced me to the work of Shawn Wasabi. I was completely entranced by the colors of the Midi Fighter, and knew I had to use it to control Nour. \nThanks to the kindness of Shawn and DJTechTools, they sent me a prototype of the Midi Fighter 64, and I hooked it up to Nour immediately! \nPLAY\n\n    I'm Tj Hughes. I like bright, saturated colors, bassy electronic music, and absurdist humor. Born and raised in St. Louis, and I grew up playing Sega Genesis and Gamecube. Sonic the Hedgehog 2 and Mortal Kombat II were the first games I remember playing, and since then, games have captured my interest as one of the most incredible, and widely unexplored creative mediums. I started making games when I was 13, after discovering the Unity game engine. After teaching myself through YouTube and Google, I started work on this really dumb FPS project that was gonna have multiplayer and zombies and RPG elements and all this other stupid stuff I honestly was never gonna finish. But it was a really great way to learn game design nonetheless! I used the knowledge I had gained to release my first complete game ever, Feesh. That was the first game I released under the name Terrifying Jellyfish.\nTerrifying Jellyfish is a solo Independent Games/Interactive company started in 2014! Based in St. Louis, I made it my goal to create subversive games, interactive experiences, live visuals, and merchandise, all based around aesthetics and color theory.

The alpha build of the game will be available as soon as it hits Steam! \nThe game shall be released on both Steam and Itch.io for PC and Mac!\nBefore this Kickstarter, I had committed to releasing this game no matter what, but this campaign will make the difference between Nour being just a fun demo, or a fully realized experience.\nMy goals with this campaign are to acquire the resources I need to realize this project to its fullest potential, spread the word about this niche & experimental game, and to put a ceiling over my head long enough to bring this project to completion. \nHaving been part of a successful Kickstarter in the past, I am confident that this campaign is what I need to make this game look and sound as delicious as possible. \nNOTE: All tiers above alpha takoyaki gets alpha access! \n  If you would like more than one of any of these add-ons, just add the total amount to your pledge! \n> 30k = Twitch Plays Nour\nExactly what it sounds like. If the campaign suprasses 30K, I'll use the power of the Twitch API to make a version of the game that'll be controlled via Twitch.tv chat. So viewers will be able to control the game by typing in commands like \"add noodle\" or \"fling chopstick\" or \"pop popcorn\". \n...\"add hoverboard\"\n> 65k = ???\nThis tier will be revealed once 30K is passed! \n- \nNour received the Pixelpop Select award this year at Pixelpop 2017!\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs for the game being released, it's not really a matter of *if*, it's more about *when*. Because of how many different elements go into game development, unforeseen circumstances (like life) may cause the game's launch to be delayed. Though there are no technical hurdles, that is the main potential hitch. However, I plan on releasing the game no matter what. \n\nI have been doing game dev for about 8 years now, and I have been a part of two game releases, two Kickstarters, and one interactive museum installation. Which is to say, I know what goes into releasing a game, and I can be counted on to deliver everything I mention in this campaign. \n\nI am developing this project solo (aside from the music and sound), so it's on me to make the game as great as I can, and I believe the $25,000 goal will really allow me to do so. It'll buy me enough time to finish the game, and also hire the help I may need to make the best possible version of the game that I can. \n\nWith that said, thank you for your support. <3\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 12 or more", "title": "Steamy Ramen", "descp": "A digital copy of the game upon release, + Your name in the credits!

You'll need to divine the other's desires in order to build trust, play your cards right, and transform mutual trust into starry satisfaction. How tingly will your interplanetary liaison feel in the end? Will your encounter leave one party sweaty and exhausted, the other hungering for more? It's up to the two of you to find out... together!\nUPDATE: Check out the replay of our latest livestream of Consentacle play, featuring Frank Lantz and Eric Zimmerman. Can two \"senior statesmen\" of game design find intimacy by tangling through cards? What do they even think of this game... at the formal or narrative level?\nWe've blown past our first two stretch goals, described below... and much faster than anticipated! So we've been making plans and measuring feasibility for further goals that won't compromise the quality of gameplay just for an overstuffed box. (OK, we know some of you like overstuffed boxes and excess libidinal energy, but we tried to pack a lot into Consentacle in the first place!) Here's the deal:\nIf we reach $135,000 in pledges (it can be done!) then every backer will get a free download of a 12-page Consentacle comic book.  On top of that, every box of Consentacle will come with the first two pages as a preview in the back of the manual--that way, you'll get some nicely printed comic art as well. This comic will tell a brief story of how Kit and Dup met, and what stood in the way. Most of all, it'll be full of more great artwork by James Harvey! Here's a collage of multiple comic-book pages by James from Batgirl and We Are Robin (for DC Comics... yep, that Robin -- but also very different Robins than the shopworn ones):\n  If you'd like to see more of James's range, check out stopjamesharvey.com or heck, check out them search results! I'm likely to help some with plotting and dialogue, but I'm keen on visual storytelling first without over-prescribing. (If you're really curious, you can check out my speech-bubbly writing work in games like Egg vs Chicken and Miss Management.\nConsentacle was originally produced as a showcase prototype for the No Quarter exhibition of games, with only a few sets in existence. We're bringing it to Kickstarter to fund mass production because so many people have asked if they can have a copy. To get it out to as many people as possible, Consentacle is priced to fund a single run, not additional printings! But what about a publisher? Well, given how unusual and suggestive Consentacle is, we've heard from more than one experienced source that it's unlikely to be widely published without some significant changes that we wouldn't want to make. There's always a possibility, but this may be the only time you can purchase a copy of Consentacle, ever. We're not guaranteeing that any stock will be left over!\nIMPORTANT: if you've played Consentacle at an event, or stared closely at photos and videos, that's the prototype version! We're making some changes in order to be able to mass-produce the game, and because we've found some problems with our pretty \"made for a gallery opening, but not for long use\" prototype materials.\nFirst of all, the cards will be smaller, but easier to shuffle, deal, and hold. If we raise a little more than our base funding level, we'll be able to upgrade the quality to an even nicer ivorycore cardstock! UPDATE: Done! Ivorycore is in.\nThe tokens in the box will either be chipboard (the kind you punch out from a sheet) or\u2014if this campaign gathers enough backers for it to be feasible\u2014injection-molded acrylic (more similar to the tokens you see in photos and videos of Consentacle, although slightly different as those are laser-cut). UPDATE: Done! We're definitely going with acrylic tokens!\nWe know many of you who've played or seen Consentacle are big fans of the colorful acrylic tokens, so we're hoping we can make them available for everyone! To make the game accessible to the maximum number of potential players, we didn't want to jack up the price to include acrylic tokens unless there's enough interest to make it less expensive for everyone! (Plastic pieces get a lot more affordable once you're making thousands of copies.)\nFor manufacturing and shipping, we're working with a number of experienced partners including Panda Game Manufacturing, who've helped produce and create many Kickstarted board and card games. Check out their showcase of successfully shipped games! We're also pleased to be able to offer \"shipping included\" prices worldwide.\nOK, settle down! We have even more ways that you can enthusiastically stuff more Consentacle into your life!\nLove the artwork on Consentacle's cards? If you back at the $58 level, you'll receive a print of the artwork from Consentacle's box cover (without labels) in full color on A3 photo-quality paper. Right now that's the piece below (Lick), but if we exceed our base funding goal we'll  commission a new original piece of artwork. Prints are limited to 100 backers!\n\"Lick.\"\nWe're also offering very limited amounts for two higher reward levels where you can commission artwork by James Harvey. Want to envision yourself in the world of Consentacle, whether as a tentacled alien or a curious human? Backers at the $235 level can specify how they want to be portrayed in a limited-color portrait, while one backer at the $750 level can request details for a full-color commission of a scene that can potentially have multiple characters! Check out James Harvey's website for more examples of what he can do. Backers at these two levels will also get a copy of James' latest book, Mouth Baby, from Black Hook press, and the $750 backer will receive a copy of James' out-of-print comic Masterplasty, Image comics edition.\n  Consentacle comes with what Naomi's decided are the most essential cards for a balanced mix. If we reach the quality-improving stretch goals described above, we may consider adding some optional extra cards! Stay tuned for more.\nYou're in luck! We have some of those left from Consentacle's debut exhibition, where players were provided with rubber tentacles to wear on their fingers. If you back at the $200 level, you'll not only get a signed copy of Consentacle, but two tentacles from the exhibition set.\nFor an overview, watch the video at the top of this page! You can also download a PDF of the rules or read on for a detailed breakdown.\n1. To begin, you'll need a partner who consents to playing with you, of course! Decide who'll play the Alien and who'll play the Human; you each get a deck, tokens in your color (red for the Human, blue for the Alien) and five cards for your starting hand.\nSome cards are more useful than others at the start of the game! If you don't like your hand, you have one chance to re-draw at the start of the game (a \"mulligan.\")\nEach turn, you and your partner will choose and simultaneously reveal a card. But first, you'll need to decide what difficulty mode you're playing on!\nIn PRACTICE CONSENT mode, you're allowed to talk out loud about your cards and strategize with each other about what to play next.\nIn CONSENT CHALLENGE mode, you can't discuss your cards at all, or make suggestions; you may only communicate non-verbally about the game. (Exception: you can remind your partner to draw a card, move tokens, etc.)\nSOUL WINDOWS mode is similar, but you may only express yourself with your eyes: no sounds or gestures, just a telepathic gaze.\nAGENTS OF CONSENT involves wearing sunglasses and staring impassively at your partner's blank visage.\nPlaying cards in Consentacle lets you perform various actions with your Trust Tokens. Some cards let you earn more Trust Tokens, while others let you move some of your Trust Tokens to a central pool:\nOnce you have some Tokens of each color in the central pool, you can effectively play cards that let you create purple Satisfaction Tokens by swapping out pairs of red and blue Trust Tokens:\n Each matched pair of Trust Tokens (one red, one blue) has the possibility of becoming one Satisfaction Token.\nSatisfaction Tokens determine the outcome of the game: was it good for you? Both of you? Play a Release card to boldly claim Satisfaction for yourself:\nThe secret to a more satisfying intimate encounter lies in playing combos. If the card you play creates a combo with your partner's card, the effect of your card may be boosted, taking you to new heights of mutual trust or satisfaction:\nBut be careful: you can't just try to match your partner's card, you've also got to think about what you're doing. Some combos are just awkward; when you both try to slyly wink at each other, you'll earn a little Trust, but not as much as you would have otherwise:\nThe last turn of the game happens after you draw the final card from your deck (you won't have a chance to play every single card, time being the enemy of every dalliance). So who won? Nobody\u2014sex is only a competition if you want it to be! To find out how the encounter was, the Consentacle rules have a chart to consult for an evaluation of your intimate encounter (click the little image below to check out the chart on the last page of our rules PDF!)\n  The full game adds a number of advanced cards as well, giving you more ways to mix it up, enhance your passionate skills, coordinate complexly with each other, and boost yourself to new heights of satisfaction!\nIt depends on what you mean! Not safe for... weddings? Walmart? Wee little kids? Women's music festivals? Witch covens? Water? Work? The answer is yes, no, that's a parenting decision, probably not, yes, the cards are not waterproof, and depends. Consentacle and all the artwork in it are designed to be suggestive, not explicit; my goal was to create a game that could be played in public without undue embarrassment and furtiveness, but with due blushing and giggling. The most explicit thing in the game is probably the fact that one card is called \"PENETRATE.\" If you're looking for more nudity and overt, sexually arousing material, we hear that \"consentacle\" as a genre has become an increasingly popular search term on some websites and forums that serve up explicit artwork!\nSpecial Thanks and Credit to: Shuangshuang Huo (video shooting/editing), Melanie Bossert (prototype token fabrication), Sarah Elmaleh (video narration), Anna Anthropy, Lauren Naturale, and Zoe Harvey.  \nThanks to many playtesters and video stars including Ben Norskov, Mohini Dutta, Robert Yang, Eddie Cameron, Eric Zimmerman, Nathalie Pozzi, Josh DeBonis, Amanda DeBonis, Colleen Macklin, Renee Zalles, Scott Price, Toni Pizza, Bennett Foddy, Doug Wilson, Jesse Fuchs, merritt k, and many more players.\nExtra Special Thanks: Charles Pratt & the NYU Game Center, without whose support the original game wouldn't have been made.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nConsentacle will be Naomi's second successful Kickstarter, following Sissyfight Returns in 2013: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1805029723/sissyfight-2000-returns\nThe team on that Kickstarter started the work of porting Sissyfight to a new platform and creating new artwork as soon as the Kickstarter finished; the team finished development and delivered all rewards to backers over the course of 2014.\n\nThis time around, Consentacle is a nearly complete project already; our team is seeking Kickstarter support to fund two things only: a completed set of illustrations for cards (80% done at time of writing, 20% to go) and the manufacturing and shipping of the actual games! New rules and cards have been tested over a period of months, and we've identified and started planning with some great, experienced manufacturing and fulfillment partners.\n\nMore details about what Kickstarter funds will be used for: James Harvey will be creating over 20 new illustrations for cards, and Naomi will do layout of a new card design with those illustrations. We'll be designing the box and laying out the rules again, with the new rules for the advanced game and cards in the mix. After that, it's off to manufacturing and finally shipping to our backers: if we reach our funding goal, those last stages will account for almost 90% of the funds we raise!\n\nThings that could go wrong: James or Naomi could get sick or injured (cross your tentacles against that risk!) Delays in manufacturing, ocean freight, customs or shipping to backers could crop up -- they often do, and sometimes it's beyond a Kickstarter creator's control. To reduce that risk, we are working with a very experienced group of game manufacturing experts (Panda Game Manufacturing, pandagm.com) who've helped turn numerous successfully-funded Kickstarter campaigns into real games in backers' hands.\n\nBecause this is our team's first non-digital Kickstarter game project, we're also getting lots of advice from close friends and colleagues who've done it before, like the folks at Local No. 12 (the Metagame, https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2093152267/the-metagame-discuss) and Resonym (Monarch, https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/maryflanagan/monarch-board-game-vie-for-the-crown?ref=profile_created and Visitor in Blackwood Grove, https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/maryflanagan/visitor-in-blackwood-grove?ref=profile_created).\n\nFinally, we've already lined up a set of regional distributors who also have plenty of experience in shipping Kickstarter board and card games to backers, quickly and intact.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "Print & Play version of Consentacle only", "descp": "Access to the downloadable print & play edition of Consentacle, which includes printable versions of cards, tokens, rules, and playmat.

The more we raise, the better quality film we can deliver. A budget breakdown is included at the bottom this post.\nHair Love, is a 5 minute animated short film that centers around the relationship between an African-American father, Stephen, his daughter, Zuri and her hair. Despite having long locks, Stephen has been used to his wife doing his daughter's hair, so when she is unavailable right before a big event, Stephen will have to figure it out on his own. This sounds simple enough, but we soon come to find that Zuri's hair has a mind of its own. \nThis story was born out of seeing a lack of representation in mainstream animated projects, and also wanting to promote hair love amongst young men and women of color. It is our hope that this project will inspire.\nI've had the idea for this project for a couple of years now, but it wasn't until I recently started coming across a lot of viral videos of black fathers interacting with their sons and daughters online that I finally had the confidence to try and make this a real thing. Below are great examples of some of the great viral videos I have come across in the past year:\nThrough this project, it is my hope that we can show a positive image of black fathers and their daughters, while encouraging natural hair and self-love throughout the world through the animated space.\nCHARACTERS:\nZURI (Daughter)\n STEPHEN (DAD)\nANGELA (Natural Hair Vlogger)\nROCKY (Pet Cat)\nMeet the crew:\nMATTHEW A. CHERRY (WRITER/CO-DIRECTOR)\nThis will be my first attempt at an animated project, but my 3rd Kickstarter campaign and I am super excited about this project. Previously, I directed two Live-action feature films: The Last Fall and 9 Rides, both of which premiered at SXSW, as well as, two Live-action short films: This Time and Forward, in addition to many music videos.\nJASON MARINO (CO-DIRECTOR)\nI will be co-directing this short film with the incredible 3D artist, Jason Marino. I came across his short film, Tamara on Twitter a few months ago and tracked him down so we could collaborate on this project. Check out his short film, Tamara below.\nVASHTI HARRISON (CHARACTER DESIGNER)\nVashti Harrison is a remarkable artist and filmmaker in her own right. Vashti illustrated all of the 2D character designs featured in our Kickstarter campaign. Vashti is also ramping up to release her first children's book Little Leaders: Bold Women in Black History, which you can pre-order right here: https://t.co/m554qLrvi4. You can also check out some more of her work below\n PETER RAMSEY (Executive Producer)\nPeter Ramsey is a legend in the animation game, and we are so fortunate to have him be a part of this project as an Executive Producer. Peter was the first African American director to direct a big studio, feature-length, animated film, Rise of The Guardians, and he is currently co-directing Sony's new animated Spider Man film that will feature, Miles Morales for Sony. Peter, is also an accomplished story board artist.\nFRANK ABNEY (Executive Producer)\nFrank Abney is another legend in the animation game that we are super excited to have as a part of this project. Frank was named one of Variety's, 10 Animators to Watch in 2016. Frank has worked on projects such as, Big Hero 6, Frozen, Kung Fu Panda 3, The Boss Baby, and Coco and is currently working on the upcoming Incredibles 2, while continuing to develop his own projects and short films. Frank is a valuable asset to the team. He likes to work on projects that spotlight strong African-American characters and illuminate key events from African-American history. \nMONICA A. YOUNG  (Producer)\nMonica Young has worked with me on all of my projects on the producing side and is another invaluable resource to the team. Emerging from the music industry, she has recently added film and TV producing to her repertoire. Monica is a super knowledgeable and experienced producer that will be helping to coordinate all of the music on the film, ranging from helping with composer selection to curating all other necessary music.\nJEROME CALDWELL (Producer)\nJerome Caldwell was a producer on my latest feature film, 9 Rides and has been a resource on a lot of my prior projects. He is a great partner when it comes to producing and getting films done, and more than that he is a great person whose knowledge and expertise will be invaluable in getting this project completed, especially in the post-production phase.\nVAUGHN GILL (Producer)\nVaughn Gill initially worked with me as the attorney for my first feature \"The Last Fall.\" He served as one of the Executive Producers on my webseries \"Almost 30\" as well as my second feature \"9 Rides.\" As a Producer, Attorney and a Father who has had the \"Hair Love\" experience his expertise will be tremendously helpful in completing this project.\nBUDGET BREAKDOWN - 200k Stretch Goal\nStoryboarding - 5k\n3D Character Designs - 10k\nEnvironment Design - 10k\nVisual Development On Characters & Environments (Plus Color Script) - 10k\nCharacter Modeling, Texturing, and Rigging - 10k\nEnvironment Modeling & Texturing - 10k\nHair, Fur, and Clothes animation - 15k\nLighting/Rendering/Compositing - 10k\nAnimation - 15k\nEditing - 10k\nSound Design & Music Composition - 10k\nAnimation Producer - 10K\nVFX - 5K\nBusiness & Legal Expenses - 25k\nKickstarter Gifts & Shipping - 25k\nKickstarter Fees - 20k\nCONCLUSION\nWe have our goal set for $75k, but we are now trying to raise $200K or more to make this project at the highest quality level we can make it. The more we raise, the more people we can hire to work on it. We are aiming to do it in the same vein as other Pixar animated, short films, and as we all know animation is more costly than traditional Live-action projects and every little bit helps. Thanks so much for checking this project out, and I hope you'll help to support it. Sincerely, thank you. \n-Matthew A. Cherry", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe biggest challenge with the project is going to be managing the pipeline of the animation work. As you all know animation is a huge undertaking and most animated hollywood films cost around a million dollars a minute to produce. We are confident that with our partner's at Nimble Collective that we will be able to manage the work flow and hire some great animators to get this project done in a fairly short period of time.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Thank You", "descp": "Thank you from director @MatthewACherry's twitter account", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Aug 2017"}], "stat": ["739 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "Hair Love Key Chain", "descp": "A key chain with our Hair Love logo plus all of the above", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["494 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 15 or more", "title": "Hair Love Pin", "descp": "A key chain with our Hair Love logo on a special pin plus all of the above", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["209 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 20 or more", "title": "Digital Download ONLY", "descp": "A digital download of our animated short film Hair Love but with no other physical gifts.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2018"}], "stat": ["472 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 25 or more", "title": "Digital Download", "descp": "A digital download of our animated short film Hair Love plus all of the above", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["1,018 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 40 or more", "title": "Hair Love Children's Book ONLY", "descp": "You get our Hair Love Children's book which is based on the plot of our short film.

Also lastly about the digital download; now that we're Oscar nominated we're going to be hitting theaters in select cities on a tour with all the shorts through Shorts International and there are a lot of tricky eligibility issues that we have to navigate with the film. With that said to be safe we won't be sending out the digital download link until after the Oscars on February 9th. I hope you all understand. Now that we're with Sony Animation it's a bigger conversation and we're trying to be smart about maintaining our eligibility throughout this month long window we have before Oscar night.

But things start to sour on his first day as he involuntarily becomes a spectator to a terrifying mutiny. When Danny unexpectedly stumbles upon Sri, one of the last surviving members of the Moura race, he begins to uncover a plot that runs all the way through the fractured society of Tierrania. Through Sol Binding, Danny is able to harbor Sri inside of him and utilize her impressive abilities as the two explore the outdoors for the first time in their lives.\nAlthough he\u2019s only spoken to his long-time friends The Radioactives via his self-made radio Survival Watch, Danny knows he can count on them. Journeying to their isolated shelters, interacting with unique communities and finally meeting The Radioactives, Danny and Sri seek their invaluable expertise to help save the people of Tierrania and Moura alike.\n                    Sol Bound is a 2D pixel action-adventure game. As Danny, you fuse together with Sri to access an array of unique powers to solve puzzles and fight dangerous Desvario - the monsters that thrive on Tierrania\u2019s spoiled land. With Sri inside of you, you\u2019re able to manipulate an invisible current called Sol, an energy which pulses through all living creatures.\nHaving sol at your disposal allows you to shoot electricity from you hand, leap high in the air, even transfer Sri to other lifeforms. Along your journey, explore a whole new world, meet a recovering society full of quirky characters and work with your network to unravel the sinister past that lead to Tierrania\u2019s decline. \nLike most action adventure games, you\u2019ll encounter the story driven puzzles, enemies and dungeons you\u2019ve come to expect - but aside from our fun game mechanics and unique storyline what exactly makes Sol Bound stand out from other action-adventure games?\nBeing the diverse Latin team we are, meant that we wanted to infuse our culture, our customs and especially our food into Tierrania. While you won't need to be reaching for a Spanish dictionary to play Sol Bound, you\u2019re sure to experience a world you\u2019ve never encountered before!\n  Have you ever wanted to be in a video game? How about your pet? With Sol Bound Rewards you can even become an honorary Junior Game Designer and help us create a quest! For those backers with tighter budgets, spending at least $50 will give you Sol Bound the Game, Exclusive Sol Bound Wallpapers, Javs\u2019 Adventuring Mix \u266a and Lazaro's Digital Art Book! And if you spend just $25 more you can get our new Kickstarter Exclusive Graphic Novel Sombra, which also comes with all the previous mentioned goodies!  \n\nIt doesn't end there though, because every week we will release a brand new \u2728 MYSTERY REWARD\u2728 !! Backers can unlock these rewards even faster by reaching the monetary goal listed above each item - Are you all up for the challenge?   \nEngaging with our backers is important to us, so for the duration of our Kickstarter campaign we will provide backers updates twice a week, and upon success, monthly development updates! Our campaign updates will reveal more about Sol Bound, like audio samples from Jav's Adventuring Mix, visual samples from Lazaro's Art Book, and an in-depth dive into our game mechanics! \n  Reaching $160k would be this little studio's dream come true! Our current goal is just enough to keep the core team afloat for the duration of the project. $160k would empower us to rent out an affordable office space, allow us to ditch Skype and finally gather the team together to work on this project full time. Over all, having more people on the team means less delays, higher quality work and happy devs!  \n\nAdditionally Crowquetica (Crow-keh-tee-kah) Games is dedicated to giving back to our local community. Upon success of our first release, our mission is to not only continue making ridiculously fun games, but to provide opportunities to students and graduates in New York City who have passion and talent for game development but lack the resources or opportunities to follow their dream. \nReaching 200k or more means that Crowquetica Games can dedicate more time to making the world of Tierrania even more complex, beautiful and fun! Depending on how much we raise past $200k, here are our goals for a better funded Sol Bound.  \nA \"Crafting System\" wherein Danny can cook all sorts of dishes, including some real life recipes you can try at home - Many from our Mamis, Tias and Abuelas!\nEnhanced Cutscene Animations\nConsole release\nVoice Acting for Main Characters  \nVinyl Record Soundtrack \n   \nFounded by the tenacious married dev duo Veronica and Sergio Nizama, Crowquetica Games Inc. is a bootstrap startup that has dedicated itself to creating fun, unique, story-driven games that challenge you and invite you to worlds you've never experienced before.

Investing in a Kickstarter is like investing in a small business: it takes risk on our part as well as yours. Most of our team has worked at small studios, startups, even kickstarted ventures so we're well aware of what can go wrong. We've gone through the growing pains of freshly hatched studios first hand, countless times being victims of that very inexperience. \n\nCrowquetica Games was built because we love working in small teams, but were tired of the inefficiency, lack of organization and lack of stability found at many startups. We've already taken these hard lessons to heart with our approach to project management, team building, and how to manage our resources. \n\nOne of Crowquetica's biggest assets is our network of allies. Working in game and tech spaces in New York City means that some of our teammates have had the chance to work with or learn from veterans from Microsoft, Avalanche Studios, Zynga and much more! Additionally, thanks to the many local resources available to us, like a bustling developer community, Unity workshops, and frequent game developer events being hosted across the city, it's not too difficult for us to get the help, advice or feedback we need to make Sol Bound a solid, fun game!\n\nIf you feel as passionate as we do about Sol Bound, make sure to let your friends, family and followers know about our game!

There's no traditional battling or dungeons, but there are boardwalk games and funnel cake.\nBUT WHO ARE YOU?\nI'm Christine! I'm currently a Master's candidate in the Interaction Design program at School of Visual Arts. I have a background in graphic and web design, and have always loved writing stories. Cape Luna is my first real game. \nWhere I started\u2014my pixel art skills a few months ago\nI've always loved community simulation games: Animal Crossing, Harvest Moon, and the Sims were games I've happily sunk hundreds (thousands?) of hours into, but I'd never seriously considered making my own game.\nThe more popular indie devs became, the more I thought about some of my own projects: half-written, character-rich stories without plots, experiments with pixel art, world-building research and brand guidelines for made-up companies. I loved working on all of these things, but I never saw them all working together.. \nFinding the queer game movement sealed the deal. I could make my own game. I had all of the pieces, I just didn't know how to put them together before. I've loved the process so far, and although I'm making the game by myself, I can't actually do it alone. To make Cape Luna the best it can be, I need your help.\nThis game is built for LGBT gamers who want more games where they can see characters who are like them. \nIt's not a teaching tool, or a chance to 'walk a mile in someone else's shoes'. Cape Luna is a bit of escapism for people who feel like they can't always be themselves.\nFortunately, more and more games today are adding options for their players. This article describes the queer game movement and it's creators much better than I could, and also highlights many of the games that have come out of it. This movement is what's giving me the opportunity to even present this game at all, and I'm so grateful and humbled by the courageous and hard-working artists who made it happen in the first place.     \n MEET JAMIE\nJamie is like most kids. They are kind and creative, an excellent listener, and can even be pretty funny sometimes. They also happen to be non-binary. Jamie has a lot of great qualities, yet some people fixate solely on their gender\u2014usually not in a good way.\nAfter a few bullying incidents at school, Jamie's parents decided to move the family to a new town. Jamie's family had spent a few summers in the small beach town of Cape Luna and it seemed like the perfect place for a fresh start. Jamie is excited to explore a new place, but is nervous that they won't fit in here, either.\nYou can help Jamie find their place in the Cape Luna community, or spend your days playing ring toss at the boardwalk. It's up to you.\nHERE'S WHERE I'M AT\nMy work on Cape Luna so far has been focused on character development, storylines, and artwork. Here's a bit of what you'll find in Cape Luna:\nThe beach\n  The boadwalk: Wonder Fun Land!\n  A boardwalk minigame prototype: ring toss!\n  A conversation with Alice\n  Part of Cape Luna's town center\n  Cape Luna's town park: the future site of the late mayor's statue\n  A conversation with Chey, and a prototype of Jamie's decision-making options\n  The residential part of Cape Luna\nHere are just a few of the characters you'll meet:\n  A potential friendship level screen\nAnd that's just the beginning! There are plenty more features I'd like to add, and some I haven't even thought of yet! That's where you come in. Contributing to Cape Luna gets you access to an open alpha where your opinion gets heard! Cape Luna is all about community: both in the game and out.\nTHE REWARDS\nAll rewards are digital, with the exception of the Beach Access Kit. The Kit includes an enamel pin, approximately .75\" in diameter, and a traditional beach badge, approximately 1\". They will look about like this, although colors may look different when they're printed:\nAs long as printing runs smoothly, the pins and badges will be shipped and delivered before the open alpha!\nCurrently, the open alpha will be available for Windows only. As this is my first game, I wanted to keep things simple so as to have a better handle on things when bugs arise. \nI settled on an open alpha instead of a full release or a demo because I want the process of creating Cape Luna to be similar to Jamie's story in the game. It's all about finding and joining a community, and I want that community involved in my process. Whether it's offering real-life experiences that make the characters more realistic or avoiding stereotypes, I seriously value input from people who want to play this game. Supporting Cape Luna means that you get to be involved in the process.\nThe alpha won't be polished. It'll break and glitch and look funky in lots of places, but that's what open alphas are for. As I've learned just throughout the process of creating this Kickstarter: people are more likely to give you advice and ways to improve if you give them sketches, as opposed to shiny, polished prototypes. This will give me a greater chance for improvement, and a truly wonderful game at the end of the road.\nTHE BUDGET\n Because I'm only creating an open alpha, and not a full-fledged game, your donations are really helping me get this game off of the ground. Basically, the more money this Kickstarter makes, the more time I can spend creating art, writing code, and debugging.\nProduction and shipping of the pins and badges will take up about a quarter of the budget, and Kickstarter takes out a small portion of whatever money is made.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe biggest risks for making and shipping pins and badges are that the pin-making factories all over the world shut down. Barring that, the pins and beach badges should be delivered right on schedule.\n\nThis is my first computer game, so I'm anticipating running into production issues\u2014it just comes with the territory. I\u2019m currently using RPG Maker MV to create the Cape Luna, which gives me access to lots of resources and aid in debugging. I've set a decently long timeline for this project so I can ensure that it's the best it can be when the open alpha is released, but I know that because of potential development issues, this timeline could be extended.\n\nI've loved working on Cape Luna so far, and I'll continue to work hard to make sure it's the very best it can be.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Thank You!", "descp": "Thank you for your support!

The 120 card deck of one, two, and three letter sequences has been carefully crafted through language analysis techniques to encourage the creation of longer, more common words.\nHow do you play?\nRewordable is a game for 2-8 players. Each game uses a variable subset of 60 cards from the 120 card game deck to provide a unique language experience every time. The goal is to build up the biggest lexicon of words. Players take turns making words, using at least one card from their hand. Players may also use cards from the center pool, add onto their own already constructed words, or steal words from other players. 16 Rewardable reward tokens give players a changing set of goals, potential strategies, and bonuses every turn. (See the rules.)\n    How is it different?\nMost word-building games use individual letters as their game pieces, and assign a value to letters based on how common they are in the English language. Makes sense, right? But there\u2019s a frustrating side effect to this design: the highest-scoring words tend to be the shortest and most obscure. (Think of someone scoring 50 points for playing \u201cXU\u201d in Scrabble.) We think that word games are more fun when you don\u2019t have to memorize a dictionary just to be competitive. So when we made Rewordable, we carefully engineered the cards to facilitate the construction of longer, more common, more satisfying words, leading to an inclusive and engaging experience for players of all skill levels.\n  How did we make it?\nRewordable is the result of a computer-aided game design process, using both computational analysis and extensive in-person playtesting. We made a computer simulation capable of playing thousands of Rewordable rounds in seconds, and then fed it a variety of decks based on the most common and most widely distributed one-, two- and three-letter sequences in English. The simulation told us how often each sequence was used across the simulated rounds \u2013 which helped us to reason about which cards worked well with each other and which were less useful.\nUsing results from these simulations, we created prototype decks with the best combinations of letter sequences and test them out with our (human) playtesters. After incorporating player feedback, we fed the deck back into the simulation, allowing us to quickly understand how the changes affected the overall balance and tempo of the game.\nThis iterative process helped us build a deck not just of common letter sequences, but of letter sequences that uniquely work together to create balanced gameplay. For example, TIO is a very common letter sequence in English, but because it almost always needs an N card to be useful, it\u2019s very difficult to use in a game of Rewordable. Our playtesters told us that TIO was useless, and the simulation confirmed it \u2013 so we dropped it. We brought this same critical process to all 120 cards in the deck.\nAdditionally, we made careful adjustments to the Rewordable deck to balance the ratio of single-letter cards (blue), two-letter cards (pink), and three-letter cards (yellow) and to keep the representation of single letters across the deck consistent with their general frequency in English. You can see aspects of this iterative process visualized in the GIF below.\n  We\u2019ve tested Rewordable on kitchen tables, coffee tables, and carpet, and at bars, cafes, local meet-ups, and most regularly the NYU Game Center\u2019s invaluable Playtest Thursdays. We\u2019re so grateful to our many fantastic playtesters who played our game through months of rule changes, new game mechanics, and drastic shifts in deck composition. We wouldn\u2019t have made it this far without their insight.\n  What do people think? \nThis summer we were the first non-digital game to be accepted as part of the NYU Game Center\u2019s Incubator program. We\u2019ve also shown at the Revolutionary Learning Conference\u2019s Arcade event and will be part of the NYC Media Lab 2016 Summit at Columbia University this September.\nWe\u2019ve played this game a lot over the past few months (and years) and by far our favorite reaction is when someone sits down to play and after a while says, \u201cThis game is incredibly frustrating. I think it broke my brain. Where can I buy a copy?\u201d If you\u2019re curious and want to see what actual games of Rewordable look like, visit our Instagram and Twitter accounts.\nWhy Kickstarter?\nWe want to get the game to as many people as we can reach. To everyone that loves word games and to everyone that hates word games \u2013 but might just love Rewordable.\nTo do a large print run though, we need a minimum number of copies. 1500 to be exact.

Backing the Kickstarter will secure you one of these first print run copies of the game and help us get the game to lots of other people (and earn you some high energy thanks from us).\n  What\u2019s in the box?\nEvery copy of the game includes 120 cards, 16 reward tokens, and an 8-page full color rule booklet \u2013 all nestled inside a cozy Rewordable box.\n  What do you get? \nRE\u2022W\u2022OR\u2022D\u2022A\u2022BLE ($20 and up) \nGet a copy of the first print run of Rewordable!

I would like to suggest that you include some blank cards with each game so that if a card or two are lost, one could replace them. I am nervous about this, so would you consider selling blank cards for such a purpose? Also, to address an earlier comment about the difficulty of shuffling, I also found that to be the case, but for the initial shuffling, I found it easier to just slide a big pile of them around on a table for a while. I'd say the card size is optimal for ease of play, and the shuffling process just requires some patience and care. I think this game would be fun as a digital game as well, where the shuffling process could be automated. One rule question: did you play around with any consequences for a failed challenge?

You can sign up for our mailing list if you want to be notified of major new projects from Arcen in general.  We expect to re-launch the project, in a revised and slimmed-down form, about one week from today.\nNow back to the original message:\nAI War 2 is the sequel to 2009's AI War Fleet Command. Like the original, AI War 2 is a real-time strategy game with elements of tower defense and grand strategy that pits you against a smart and deadly AI.\nAlso like the original, AI War 2 is an asymmetric game. The AI does not play by your rules: it is much more powerful than you, has no supplies you can disrupt, and its resources are literally infinite. Your successes strengthen the AI's focus on you, requiring you to balance immediate needs against long term costs.\nWe\u2019ve made a massive 160+ page design document, because we feel it\u2019s important for backers to know exactly what they\u2019re getting. The big barriers to entry with the first game were an incredibly-steep learning curve, a clunky interface, and outdated graphics.  Those are the first things we\u2019ve addressed,  but we're also bringing a lot of other new things to the table for people who already loved the first game.\nNow we need your help to fund the game. [Here's the plan for if we don't.]\n Quick bits:\nWe did a massive reddit AMA -- more than 50 pages of responses, good grief!\nChris returned to Three Moves Ahead for the third time, this time in Episode 372.  It's more industry-focused than we meant it to be.\nChris returned to the Quarter to Three podcast with Tom Chick, where they focused on the gameplay as well as Chris's earlier inspirations.\nWe really need your help spreading the word, no joke.\nA (much) lesser way of helping out is via our Headtalker campaign, which is still a big deal and is even easier.\nWe collected a lot of fun and awesome story snippets about the AI from the first game.\nWe also collected some of the best After Action Reports people wrote for the first game.\nChat with us and other backers on our Discord server?\nWe intended to make AI War 2 a straightforward sequel. New graphics, port the gameplay, trim some fat, and iterate from there after 1.0. Then we had an idea. And then another. Then we asked our amazing fan community for their ideas, and now we have a design document longer than some novels. AI War 2 will be complete when we have implemented every mechanic in the document, preferably exactly as described. Some highlights include:\nKeeping the best parts of AI War Classic: the focus on strategy over tactics, the ability to granularly customize your campaign, massive space battles, and an AI that can surprise you.\nOver one hundred types of ships ranging from fighters to capital ships to massive superweapons.\nExpanding the AI's toolbox of tricks and strategies -- the AI will recapture lost ground and press the advantage when your losses mount up.\nLetting you decide your army\u2019s strengths and capabilities via a new Science system.\nExpanding battlefields from individual single planets to entire solar systems.\nReplacing the original game\u2019s ship triangle with more nuanced categories.\nLetting you play as humans, the incredibly powerful Spire, or the long dead but mysteriously revived Zenith. Wait, what?\nYes you read that right. Our biggest, most exciting new feature in AI War 2 is selectable player factions, based on the aliens from AI War Classic's 1st and 3rd expansions. Both newcomers have unique units and skills that set them apart from humanity and one another, and unique relationships with the other factions in the galaxy including the AI.\n        AI War 2 is an opportunity to rectify the first game's biggest flaw: usability. More than half a decade of work went into Classic and it shows. There are so many mechanics to the game that even veteran players spend game time parsing through tooltips. Sub-screens are densely packed and poorly marked. Presentation-wise AI War Classic is utilitarian at best, cluttered at worst.\nCleaning the mechanics up for AI War 2 was a joint project between us and our community, who helped by identifying too-similar mechanics for merger, and time sinks ripe for elimination.\n  Take the proposed UI changes. Tooltips are now much shorter but can be locked in place. Mouse over a locked tooltip and another tooltip pops out! By folding less immediately relevant information under information that is more relevant, we can clear up screen space and still provide you with the information you need.\nOur efficiency improvements aren\u2019t limited to the interface -- we dissected and rebuilt unit control, resource generation, building structures and defenses, connecting to multiplayer sessions and empire management, looking for ways to ensure players spend less time fiddling and more time commanding fleets.\n  Thanks to fixing up the above usability issues, AI War 2 is well placed to deal with Classic\u2019s second major issue: the killer learning curve. AI War is meant to be a hard but fair game, and the start menu should not be enough to defeat new players.\nWe\u2019re coming at the problem from a few different angles. The usability changes will help smooth the difficulty curve once they\u2019re in-game, as will the improved ship classification system. We\u2019re going to include quickstart options in AIW2 so players can jump into the game without fiddling with settings. Veteran players should enjoy these preset games as well.\nOne thing we will not be doing is dumbing the game down. We shudder at the very thought and it isn\u2019t necessary.\nThe most immediately apparent change between Classic and this sequel is the move from sprites to 3D. By moving to 3D we're able to better use the capabilities of even lower-end video cards to provide clearer, crisper, more scalable resolution-independent graphics. We're pushing more geometry, which your GPU is awesome at handling, instead of relying on lots of 2D textures, which your GPU can handle but not so well. This helps with everything from immersion, to a sense of scale, to performance. Yes, really!\n    Originally AI War's story was confined to its opening crawl: the AI rose up, ending an 800 year long human civil war and nearly driving humanity to extinction, before turning their attention to other matters. The expansion packs added aliens, lore and a story campaign (Fallen Spire), as well as a few alternate ways to win the AI War. But questions remain about the AI\u2019s goals and motivation, and about the recent and ancient history of the setting.\nWe're excited to finally start answering these questions, some of which have gone unanswered since 2009. We are also preparing to link AI War up with other Arcen titles. This will be the first time many of the connections will be laid out or explained!\nDuring your fight against the AI you\u2019ll discover floating derelicts that provide you with material for the war effort and occasionally lore about the setting. The playable factions each have their own perspective on the war and the AI, while minor factions have their own stories to share. Your discoveries will be kept in a logbook that persists across campaigns so you can peruse it at your leisure.\nIt doesn\u2019t stop there: all new factions, entities and mysteries are showing up in the Milky Way Galaxy. How they\u2019ll affect you and the ongoing war has yet to be revealed.\nWe are pleased to announce that AI War 2 will be open and easy to modify, while still maintaining sim-concurrence. Players will be able to modify ships and structures, the design of AI personalities, and create tutorials, scenarios, and vignettes of their own. The design document has a long (LONG) list of modifiable components that we identified before we even started making the game. \nArcen (that\u2019s Ar-KEN) Games started in 2009 with a lone programmer on a mission (Hi everyone! - Chris). Most real time strategy games at the time lacked artificial intelligence worthy of the name. Once you understood how the AI worked, the challenge, and most of the fun, disappeared.  So Chris decided to make his own. \nIt would promote strategy over tactics, reward players for experimenting, and constantly surprise them. The game needed to be fun for Chris even if he knew the game backwards and forwards.\nThrough his sister he found a composer (Hi Pablo!) and the pair released AI War through their website in 2009 before expanding to the usual digital distribution platforms. AI War was one of the first titles in the \u201cmodern wave\u201d of indies.\nSeven years, ten games, ten expansions to those games, and hundreds of patches to those games later Arcen Games is a proud independent game studio with fans all over the world.\nFrom its origins as a one man product, AI War Classic morphed into a community driven cult classic. Critical praise for the original is glowing, as our website can attest. Some highlights include:\n\"It\u2019s a Sins of the Solar Empire meets Supreme Commander meets Simply Nothing Else, and I think a lot of you will find this very intriguing.\" \u2013 Kieron Gillen, Rock Paper Shotgun August 2009\n\"...I\u2019ll be surprised if anyone else twists the RTS formula this dramatically and this effectively. And I\u2019m hoping it\u2019ll be the Next Big Thing, because it\u2019s big, different, entirely unprecedented and an exciting way to play an RTS.\" \u2013 Tom Chick, Crispy Gamer, August 2009\n\"...as much heart and soul as Dune 2, Total Annihilation, Homeworld, Galactic Civilizations and Desktop Tower Defense rolled into one.\" - Alec Meer, PC Gamer October 2009\nThese 2009 reviews all predate AI War's first expansion pack, and all the updates since then. It's on the strength of those updates that AI War Classic made Rock Paper Shotgun's list of the best strategy games of all time.\nThe icing on the cake is that Classic still reaches new fans every day!\nSmall problem: we've made games since AI War Classic that taught us some really cool tricks, but we can't bring those lessons back into Classic. Keith LaMothe -- the lead programmer for AI War since 2013 or so -- described AI War's code as \"...a lot like a lumber mill built by two guys with nearly 0% concern for safety. 5-foot-radius sawblades spinning at maximum speed hanging from minimum-strength supports in the middle of an empty room with no safety shields and raw wood being thrown at them by various devices. You could call it 'efficient', you could call it 'horrifying'.\"\nThis was three years ago and the problem's gotten worse since then (if it helps, imagine the mill is now on fire). At this point there\u2019s no way to to implement all the tasty technical things we want to in the old engine. It\u2019s time to start anew.\nHere's the trailer for version 8.0 of AI War Classic: \nAnd if you think the design document for AI War II (this project) is long, then you should see the incredible insanity that are the release notes for the original AI War.\nKeith's been prepping for AI War 2 since 2015. He's built a new lumber mill so efficient at multi-threading it can just about travel through time. He's also responsible for ensuring the game will be moddable, something that just isn\u2019t possible in AI War Classic\u2019s code\nChris has come a long way since the days we coded everything to DirectX. Several years ago we ported AI War Classic to Unity, and at the time the only part of Unity 3D we had use for was the cross-platform shader pipeline. Since 2013, Chris has expanded outward into increasingly advanced Unity tricks and the 3D graphics pipeline. The recently-released Unity 5.4 build adds even more tools we needed.\n  We plan to stick to our design document until 1.0. That means that any stretch goals that happen (thanks ahead of time if we get there!) will not impact the schedule we laid out above... even though we already have a few ideas on how to make the game bigger and better. Every theoretical stretch goal will have its own budget and schedule\nWhat might those be? We'll talk about them should we pass our initial funding goals. In the meantime please see the \u201cNot For 1.0\u201d Limbo section of the design document. It talks about some of the things we wanted to do in the first build but wound up out of scope -- great material for stretch content.\nBut that\u2019s for the future. Right now we're focused on reaching our initial funding goals.\n    (Please excuse our dust!  We're currently updating this section.)\nDesign and name an AI personality: Please see the design document for an explanation of AI personalities and their traits. You can go as nuts as you like with the settings you choose for the traits, and we\u2019ll include it in the game. That said, be warned that we will put exceedingly hard or easy ones into relevant categories denoting them as such, which may make them not show up in most people\u2019s games. If you would like for us to keep them in the \u201cgeneral pool\u201d that is within a standard deviation of balance, we\u2019ll be happy to do that for you. Please keep the name of the AI thematic and clear as to what the AI actually acts like, but we\u2019ll include a special note that says it was created by you (your name or handle).\nName a satellite human faction: Backers at the Mark V/Mysterious Human and above may name one of AI War 2\u2019s new \u201csatellite factions\u201d. Satellite factions have no presence in your part of the galaxy but nevertheless play a vital role in the war: AI bait. Discover this faction\u2019s location and the AI will send forces to investigate, reducing the heat on you. Satellite factions may show up in other contexts as well. Stay tuned!\nWrite a Player-triggerable taunt: To be voiced by the awesome Ben McAuley, who you can hear in the kickstarter trailer. No profanity, and this is subject to approval, but you don\u2019t have to keep with the lore of the game. No copyright infringement on other franchises, but quotes and parodies are fine. The design document explains them in more detail.\nName a satellite alien faction: As above, but with aliens. We separated these out because aliens are much more entertaining. Should you prefer to name a human faction instead, just let us know.\nDesign a minor faction's lore: Returning from AI War Classic, minor factions represent human, Zenith, Neinzul and Spire factors in the war (and active in the galaxy) that aren\u2019t the player. Backers at the Neinzul/Faction Scribe level get to develop the lore for one of these groups. Working with our loremaster and other Arcen staff, you may choose to expand a planned minor faction or design one yourself.\nIMPORTANT, PLEASE READ: Designing a minor faction\u2019s lore does not mean you are designing their mechanics. Please be thematic and appropriate when you develop your faction.\nNEW REWARD! One copy of Stars Beyond Reach: By popular request!  We hope to one day finish this game -- we've invested almost half a million dollars into R&D on it, after all -- but can in no way guarantee that.  We have no immediate plans to resume work on it.  However, a lot of our testers greatly enjoyed various iterations of it.  In Steam (this is only via Steam), there are various beta builds you can choose from: 0.771 is a super old one from April 15, 2015.  0.840 is the last multi-city build, from May 22.  0.854 is the last build before the \"industrial and commercial overhaul,\" from May 28.  0.877 is the last version with districts, from June 8th.  The default build is 0.918, with territories.  There is a \"limitedbeta\" version that is for internal use only, and this reward does not grant access to that.\nDesign custom space station: Collaborating with Blue, Neinzul/Station Architect backers will design a custom space station for the minor faction of their choice. The nature of your collaboration will depend on how much of a direct role you want in the art design, within the boundaries of the game\u2019s artstyle and technical limitations.\nWrite an AI taunt: To be voiced by the awesome Ben McAuley, who you can hear in the kickstarter trailer. He\u2019ll be done up nice and evil and robotic, rather like you can hear Chris Park in the AI War 8.0 trailer, although with more clarity. No profanity, and this is subject to approval in terms of broadly fitting with the lore of the game, but we hope you have some fun with it. Chris will work with you to make sure that we\u2019re able to use your taunt in the best possible trigger points, although be aware that because of the dynamic nature of the game there\u2019s a limit on how tightly we can control that. We\u2019ll also work with you on wording if there\u2019s something that doesn\u2019t quite flow right in Ben\u2019s accent, while trying to keep as close to your original as possible.\nDesign an alien artifact: The design document explains alien artifacts.  Work with Blue to pick out a theme for their structures, and with Jack to write a short lore piece explaining one thing about the artifact.\nDesign a rare alien artifact: Same as the above, except even more awesome. Rare artifacts are something game-changing indeed. Note that they will need to pass muster balance-wise, and use existing tech mechanics.\nDesign a mystery faction's lore: A number of satellite factions will receive further lore development. Backers at the Zenith/Fleet Engineer level and above will get to choose a faction to develop themselves. You may choose to expand your own satellite faction, or with permission, that of another backer. We will coordinate with you as needed.\nDesign custom fleet ship: Collaborating with with Blue and Chris, you will design a fleetship, artistically and mechanically. While new mechanics are out of scope, Fleet Engineers will be decide what abilities their ship has and what its combat role is. Especially powerful craft could turn into prizes given for dealing with minor factions or elite AI ships. Ships that break the difficulty curve entirely will not be allowed in the regular game\u2026 but if you really want, it might become a \u201ccheat ship\u201d.\nLearn the AI's secret: Why did the AI turn on mankind? Why did it fail to destroy humanity when it had the chance? And why did the AI leave itself vulnerable during the First AI War? The answers remain secrets, one that we\u2019re preparing now to reveal to the AI War superfans at the Spire tiers. If you want to know, then please keep it to yourself! If you\u2019d prefer not to know, we\u2019ll happily keep this secret a while longer. Still, one cool turn deserves another, and this is the coolest thing we could think to do.\nDesign new canon alien race: Working with Chris, you\u2019ll come up with the 4th and 5th alien species in the Arcenverse\u2019s Milky Way. Your race may be newcomers to the galactic stage in 1.0, but they will go on to join the Zenith, Spire, and Neinzul in future AI War & Arcenverse media. We\u2019ll do our best to accommodate your ideas for your creation\u2019s characteristics, history and name, but may veto or change elements to better mesh with our setting.\nHelp create a music track: For the music loving superfan: you will work with Pablo Vega to develop an all new song for AI War 2\u2019s soundtrack! The nature of the collaboration depends on you. If you are musically inclined we invite you to contribute a tune you\u2019d like to see worked into a larger piece. Otherwise, please suggest a genre you think meshes with AI War\u2019s soundtrack, or a tone or mood you\u2019d like to evoke, or\u2026 something. It\u2019s up to you!\nThis will be added to the 1.0 soundtrack, so you\u2019re actually making the soundtrack bigger by choosing this tier.\nSkyward Collapse Source Code: For the aspiring indie developer, or the Arcen (or Skyward Collapse) superfan.  You'll get full access to the code for Skyward Collapse, with the ability to inspect, modify, compile, and use it as you desire.  This will be under an NDA that prevents you from sharing the code with parties outside your team, but you can make commercial works based on it.  Please note that this code is completely programmer-oriented and not for anyone who wants to work in a visual editor.  Please message us for any questions you have before selecting this reward.\nThis pie chart shows how we\u2019ll be spending the money from this Kickstarter if we hit our initial funding goal and nothing more. The amount of money budgeted for design and simulation work is lower than one might expect. We've spent our own money on design and programming in advance of this Kickstarter. That money is not included in this budget and will not be reimbursed by the funds we raise here.\nStretch goals are not covered in the general budget. They will have their own budgets, with costs divided between the cost of fulfillment and Kickstarter's take. Example: a music stretch goal would be about 88% music cost and 12% kickstarter cost.\nOne last note about the budget: the time it takes to make each part of a game is unequal. Design and art get done before programming, which gets done before balance and QA. In this budget, Chris and Blue will only work full-time on AI War 2 until the design work and art assets are done, after which they will move to another Arcen project. Funds from the AI War 2 Kickstarter will not be used to fund their activity on other projects.\nThis changes if we hit a dozen stretch goals or if the game sells extraordinarily well in Early Access/after release. In either case Chris and Blue will move back to full-time work on AI War 2's post-release content, and will draw pay from the new funds. Our hope is that we'll get to keep the whole team together making AI War 2 for a long time to come!\nThe design document is huge, and the below charts don\u2019t remotely cover every feature in detail. However, they do give a pretty good overview of the status as of the start of the kickstarter.  Further updates can't be reflected here, but you'll be able to see that on our site and in update messages.\n   ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThanks for reading this far! In exchange we\u2019ll let you in on a secret: the biggest threat to AI War 2 is this Kickstarter failing. Arcen has spent over seven years making AI War Classic. We\u2019ve patched it, improved it and expanded on it enough that, short of the AI rising up and destroying humanity, if we get our funding we can all but guarantee we'll release AI War 2.\n\nThat said, things change during development. Ideas can need more time, or not work at all. Miss a milestone and the game gets delayed. Programming challenges could push features intended for 1.0 into the post-release period. And this is before getting into acts of god and personal tragedies.\n\nAI War II is set to avoid issues common to Kickstarted videogame projects. Our finished design document is huge and hugely specific, we've never had a game planned out in as much detail as AI War 2 is in every area. The funding we need for the project has been carefully considered, and we're being utterly ruthless with the scope of the 1.0 build.\n\nWe have two more secret weapons: AI War Classic and our community. Almost everything in AI War 2 has an equivalent in AI War Classic. If we run into issues implementing a feature we can look back to the original version. For everything past that point, we rely on our fans, always a source of ideas and creative solutions to problems. We have a reputation for speaking with our fans and listening to them in return. You\u2019ll know what we\u2019re doing, what our challenges are, and what we\u2019re doing to overcome them. We\u2019ll go into excruciating detail (after telling you to expect \"a brief update\" or \"a quick video,\"), just like always. It\u2019ll be great.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Chris McElligott Park/Arcen Games\n2 created \u00b7 26 backed\nSmall indie studio founded in 2009 by Chris Park.

While still in its early stages, gamers who love crafting and exploration should keep an eye on this game.\"  - SIX Judge\n\n\u201cWhat struck me most about Potions: A Curious Tale is the beauty of the sprites used throughout it.\u201d -  Spong\n\u201cPotions: A Curious Tale makes players re-think the standard hack-n-slash, kill-the-monster gameplay.\u201d - MMORPG\n \"It brought back a sense of nostalgia -- it reminded me of a cross-breed of old school games.\" - SIX Judge\n\"Something wicked, this way. Fun!\"\nCombat is fast-paced, non-linear, and highly customizable. Set your own play style with the potions you use and the way you choose to face threats. Go full-throttle with an arsenal of deadly potions that burn enemies to ashes, or drop a confetti bomb and escape before they can blink. \nPotions\u2019 effects can work together, allowing for powerful combinations of different attacks. They can also trigger helpful and deadly reactions in the environment. \nTiming is key, any pause taken in battle to throw one of your potions leaves you vulnerable as your enemies barrel down upon you. You\u2019ll have to time attacks just right to take down tougher enemies. All potions are friendly-fire, so be careful where you point that incendiary vial! \nSome creatures will even need to be coaxed by other methods to share their goods. You must think carefully about which monsters to engage with and which to avoid or trick. Sometimes, using your enemies against each other is the most efficient solution. \nGet too carried away fighting and you\u2019ll use up your precious potions and have to re-arm before your next adventure. \n\"Every problem... has a solution.\"\nOn Luna\u2019s path to master potion brewing, she must gather rare ingredients to craft new potions. While her grandmother will teach her some potion recipes, most recipes must be discovered through experimentation with ingredients. \nEach ingredient has descriptive text that hints towards its potential use. These descriptions, along with additional hints from characters in the game, can lead Luna to craft undiscovered recipes. \nLuckily, Luna also learns from her failures. So, while an unsuccessful experiment may ruin her ingredients, it also provides her insight that will lead to the discovery of new recipes as her skills grow.\nIf she\u2019s just refilling her potion satchel, Luna can use her trusty recipe book, where she records all of her previous concoctions. \nLuna must manage her potion supplies by avoiding unwanted trouble and exploring to find ingredients for recipes, or go out and hunt exotic monsters to gather rare ingredients for experimentation! \nEnchanted creatures, large and small, dwell in the forests, caves and mountains around Old Haven. Some are harmless or even benevolent. Others are licking their chops at the prospect of having a lovely young witch for supper.\nEach creature in the Deep Dark Forest has its own strengths and weaknesses. While your potions of flame may burn spiders to ash, they\u2019ll have little impact on the lava-loving salamander. Think of each creature you encounter as a tiny puzzle, with abilities, vulnerabilities, and behaviors you can exploit to your strategic advantage (and monetary gain).\nAlthough many monsters hold the ingredients you need to brew more powerful potions, most will be reluctant to part with them. Some may be persuaded by force, others by charm, still others by guile. It\u2019s up to you to brave the wilderness while using tricks, cunning, and an arsenal of arcane connections to win the components you\u2019ll need to become a potions master.\nA good witch chooses her battles wisely! Remember, not every creature needs to be defeated, and picking the wrong fight may be the difference between being the cook and being the meal.\n\"Go stir crazy!\"\nNot only will your wits and potions help you with the monsters you encounter on your adventures, they will also be key to solving the countless puzzles strewn across the lands. Some obstacles will need a special potion to pass, while others will require creative problem solving to unlock their secrets! \nHidden items are scattered all over this mystical land, so don\u2019t be surprised if any rock or thicket conceals a hidden artifact or ancient potion recipe forgotten over the ages. Even your talks with characters can unveil important pearls of wisdom. \nLuna lives in a world inspired by fairy tales and folklore from around the globe, from African folklore to Western nursery rhymes. Luna's wit and intellect help her overcome challenges posed by these enchanted lands. However, in her quest to become a Potions Master, she also learns important coming-of-age lessons in the tongue-in-cheek story line. Respect is earned, advice can be deceiving, and adults aren't always right. \nLuna never quite fit in with her peers as she was always off exploring and experimenting. When one of her experiments explodes spectacularly, Luna learns that she has an aptitude for brewing magical potions. Unable to train Luna herself and desiring to keep the young girl out of further trouble, Luna\u2019s mother sends her to live with her grandmother to learn potion crafting. \nGranny lives in a small village to the north on the edge of the Deep Dark Forest. Her little town, Old Haven, is the last stop for adventurers on their way to find fame, fortune, and glory in the enchanted lands beyond. A respected Potions Master, Granny has more than enough business selling potions and remedies to the townsfolk and travelers. However, with her advanced age, she is happy to take on an apprentice who can venture into the enchanted forests, mountains, deltas, and grasslands on her behalf. \nWhether it\u2019s helping Mary Muffet with a spider problem or assisting the monk, Tripitaka, and his unlikely crew of disciples on their pilgrimage, Luna finds a way to lend a hand with her cunning wit and, of course, her potions. \nFull Release \nThe full release will be available for Windows, Mac, and Linux via direct download (DRM-free) and Steam.\nAlpha/Beta Access \nAccess to the alpha and beta will be granted on Steam for Windows initially, with Mac to follow.

Two generations? Five?\nIt's a tale told over and over--echoes of the same people, the same stories, across time.\nThe choices, the context, and the consequences change with history.\nThe experience doesn't.\nMeet war, death, famine, and pestilence--themes in an eternal fugue.\nThis is a game about lived experience.\nIt's about the experience all immigrant communities share, and eventually forget.\nIt's about what is different, on each turn of history's wheel, that takes the world by surprise.\nAny two playthroughs may be resonant with one another, but will never be alike.\nWhat will your story be?\nFEATURES\nA microcosm of real immigrant communities and the legacy of borders. \nInspired by history and firsthand accounts from post-WWII immigrant communities around the world, from Soviet Poland to American-occupied Okinawa to the contemporary exodus out of Syria.\nThe countries are fictional, the people are familiar, the world is our own.\nGameplay influenced by our favorite narrative-heavy Japanese SLGs and visual novels--but with a distinctive Western style.\nIn developing the game's unique mechanics, we closely studied Persona 4, Phoenix Wright, Fate stay/night, and Tsukihime--but also Western socially conscious sim games like This War of Mine and Molleindustria's McVideogame.\nLots of little surprises will keep you on your toes.\nNot just black and white.\nYour characters belong to one of ten fictional races, none of them real, all of them familiar.\nThis affects their appearance everywhere in the game--even in CGs!\nYou get to choose what race your characters are exactly once. \nEvery playthrough after that, the game chooses for you.\nThis is no hold-hands-sing-kumbaya, America-centric moral tirade about how racism would magically go away if white people would just be a little more polite to brown people. \nWe aspire to explore the subtleties and complexities of racism and international race relations more deeply than any other game you've played.\nThere is no \"lawful/chaotic\" binary, there is no moral alignment gauge. Faction loyalties are not quantified as stats.\nYour characters will struggle against not only the racism of their new homeland but the racism within themselves, and among each other. \nWe want to move the conversation around racism away from \"you can't say that\" and more towards \"this is what it feels like.\" \nIn service to this concept, we took great care to make identification with each race feel convincing without pandering to stereotype. \nA few of our playtesters--no strangers to narrative-heavy video games--told us this was the first game that made them feel truly represented.\nPlay once, then play again from the perspective of your adversaries.\nOver ten different countries, with several completely different main arcs and an astounding number of side stories. No two countries play alike--like a real-life immigrant, you must learn your new culture and use that knowledge to adapt.\nDo you assimilate, and aspire to be treated as countrymen by your new neighbors?\nOr do you preserve what you can of your parents' heritage and strive to be respected for being different?\nAn SLG unlike any other.\nTriumph against destiny in a deliberately unfair world. Use your wits to beat the system--or work around it.\nOr overthrow it.\nOr cast it aside and try to make your way with nothing.\nFour Horsemen observes how you try to live within a hostile society, and your choice of strategy, not what items you get or quests you complete, drives the story. \nHow the local people perceive your race affects everything, from the prices in the shop to the options you have available in dialogue. \nNo two races solve any storyline the same way, and some stories only belong to certain races.\nA deliberately impossible economy loop.\nYour knowledge of other video game stories will betray you!\nStats, gear, and grinding will not deliver victory.\nNegotiation is never as easy as always flattering people bigger than you and making grand speeches for people smaller than you.\nFishing for the best possible reward can bring dire consequences.\nYou will have to use your brain--and your heart.\nThe most sophisticated profanity system in the history of video games.\nWe're not even fuckin' kidding!\nMeticulous linguistics research, cross-checked against native speakers, ensure that characters swear convincingly (and hilariously) in any of the game's languages.\nYour protagonists sound like real teenagers, not what adults want teenagers to sound like.\nTense, exciting microaggression system (instead of combat). \nWith fancy Phoenix Wright-like animations!\nTalk your way out of any situation, or resort to your fists!\nBut beware, any choice in a difficult situation comes with consequences...\nHow will you get out of this one?\nCHARACTER ARCHETYPES\nAsk any schoolteacher, bartender, or flight attendant: there are only so many different kinds of people.\nDifferent names, same personalities.\nThis game is about four of them.\nFour teenaged immigrants, one born in the old country, three born in the new, who find something everyone wants: a place to call their own.\nThey may find their heritage--or their heritage may find them...\nWAR!\nThe leader of the Riders and the only first-generation immigrant of the group, War's haunted eyes and tough demeanor belie the playfulness of a girl who struggles to balance between growing up too soon and catching up too late on her lost childhood. A bit of a jock.\nShe has a secret fondness for lurid poetry.\nLIKES: playfighting, woooo partay, slashfic, cigarettes\nHATES: actual fighting, solitude, thinking about the past, thinking about the future\nTHEMES: personal identity, security, armed conflict, heritage, nation-building\nDEATH!\nA free spirit and incorrigible smartass who spends way too much time hanging out with college kids from the old country on the Internet, War's younger sister Death couldn't care less about politics or identity. She lives for one thing and one thing only: making herself all the cool stuff she's not allowed to have. Unfortunately, she's not very good at it yet...\nEveryone thinks she's going to grow up to be the next Steve Jobs. She doesn't know who that is.\n\nLIKES: breadboards, bright pink, social media, yolo as a way of life\nDISLIKES: stupid boys they're so dumb like she could go on forever about how dumb they are\nTHEMES: lived experience, erasure, self-determination, industry, the meaning of labor\nFAMINE!\nFamine has it pretty good compared to War and Death--he's a naturalized citizen who grew up in his new country, speaks with the local accent, and could almost pass for a native if given the chance. But this \"almost\" is what torments him: he's the only child of a single dad, he's an unremarkable student, he's just a little too awkward to be well liked at school, and there's always just barely not enough money to get by without cutting corners.\nThat's not going to stop him, though! Oh no. Just you wait. He's got big dreams, and he's going to make them happen--just as soon as he figures out what they are.\n\nLIKES: gumption, giant robot anime, cooking poorly, wearing French maid outfits (shut up bro it was just that one time and also that other time and the time after that), Death\nDISLIKES: his dad, being made fun of, being broke, himself \nTHEMES: opportunity, entrepreneurship, gender roles, equality, respectability, institutional privilege\nPESTILENCE!\nPesty is an enigma wrapped in a shroud of pot smoke. The son of two unremarkable, well-off parents from the old country, Pestilence has spent his entire life in his new homeland. A gentle giant, he is unflinchingly upbeat, slow to anger, and fond of platitudes from hospital anti-depression brochures. He is often high.\nDespite his unaggressive personality, he is widely reviled at school for reasons no one seems willing to explain. Strangers recognize him on sight, and find him immediately unsettling. He seems pretty chill about it, and cultivates his aura of unease into a morbid sense of humor.\n\nLIKES: friendship, chilling, posi vibes, deep thoughts, plants\nDISLIKES: shouting, negative feelings, toxic people, bureaucracy\nTHEMES: faith, conquest, demography, social justice, the spread of ideas\nTHE TEAM\nNuclear Fishin' Software is a tiny studio with a exceptionally diverse team, representing extraordinary talent across the underground comics, music, and independent games scenes in New York City.\nWe are based in Brooklyn, we are professionals with years of game industry experience, we are all immigrants, and we love SLGs. This game is very close to our hearts.\nOur core creative team consists of:\nKevin Chen -- writing, programming, direction, design\nNYC game industry veteran and Nuclear Fishin's founder.\nHas worked in games for just under seven years, in both AAA and indie, and has been making games for much longer than that.\nFormer Gameloft NYC programming lead.\nIasmin Omar Ata -- character design, CG illustration \nProfessional comics artist and curator at the Babycastles video game art gallery in NYC. \nCreator of Mis(h)adra, the celebrated webcomic about epilepsy.\nOlga Andreyeva -- background and item illustration\nFreelance comics artist and illustrator.\nCreator of the phenomenal transmedia comic Xantara.\nAlyssa Menes -- music and sfx\nProfessional composer and video game sound designer.\nHas done audio work for over 20 game projects, including Blackwell: Epiphany and Hiveswap.\n(Our Kickstarter video was shot and edited by the talented Caroline Voagen Nelson.) \nWe've licensed music from exceptionally talented musicians in a variety of genres. Have a listen!\nOut of System Transfer's \"Fear Jelly\":\nOur day phase BGM by Alyssa Menes:\n Sky Flying By's \"The Last Place You Looked\":\n  THE DREAM\nWe've been plugging away at this game for about half a year now, and it's really shaping up! All of the game's important systems are implemented and ready to scale, and we've already finished one of the main storylines, a variety of side quests, all the art for the protagonists, and most of the NPCs. Given the ambitious nature of the game's narrative and our eventual emphasis on replayability, we estimate it will take about another half year to deliver on its full potential. This timeframe includes at least two more main storylines, a complete UI overhaul, and enough new content to make multiple playthroughs fun and meaningful.\nAlas, only Kevin is working on Four Horsemen full time, and he doesn't believe in asking people other than himself to work for free. This project is not going to fund itself. That's where you come in!\nWe think a game can communicate the immigrant experience in ways that a book or film can't. This game puts you directly in the shoes of young people in a new land, trying to find their place in society and piece together who they are. You are the one who navigates the rules of a foreign society, figuring out its values as you go along. You are the one who sets precedents, on purpose or by accident, for a new community that may last generations. You are the one who confronts blistering racism, both overt and subtle, and decides how to respond. It's one thing to read or hear about such things, and another to have to answer the question: What would I do?\nFor those of you who are descendants of immigrants, we hope this game will lend you some insight to how your ancestors thought and felt. And for those of you who are not, we hope it will instill some empathy and understanding for strangers who arrive on your shores. Given the terrifying wave of xenophobia that sweeps every country once a generation, it's no hyperbole for us to say we think this game has the potential to make the world a more compassionate, understanding place. \nHelp us make this happen!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nBacking any crowdfunded game project is a risk. We've all backed exciting projects that went south because the developers got excited and scaled up to the point where it became more than they could handle, or because they so overcommitted on their backer rewards that they didn't have the time or money to complete the actual game. We've also heard horror stories about teams that promised the moon and ended up delivering very little. We don't want to be your next cautionary tale--our ambition is bounded by a careful, hard-won pragmatism, and a deep understanding of what we can realistically accomplish with our time, team, and budget.\n\nAll of us have worked in games before, some of us on projects much larger than this--we've already learned the hardest lessons through experience. We know how to carefully plan projects to scale (both up and down--what's best for a team of 50 doesn't necessarily work for a team of four) and save a little in our budget for unexpected contingencies, and we've done that with Four Horsemen since before we began. \n\nBut you shouldn't take our word for it! That's why we're releasing a huge, free playable demo, with an entire main arc, the mechanics of nearly every system in the game, and more gameplay than some entire finished visual novels. We don't want to tell you what we're capable of in half a year, we want to show you. If we can do all this on a shoestring budget before our first dollar of outside funding, through all the usual surprises and disasters that harry any development cycle, imagine what we can accomplish with your support, with all the foundations already laid and in place.\n\nWe can't promise that nothing will go wrong during development. What we can promise is that this team is experienced enough to adapt to trouble. This game isn't merely a learning experience or a resume padder--we know what we're doing, and we're serious about making Four Horsemen a game you'll be telling your friends about for years to come.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #12", "update_userinfo": "*WHUMP* what's that sound?", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #11", "update_userinfo": "v1.1 free update: MIGRANT SPRING", "update_content": "Hi everyone!

You know this would look great in your home.\nOur Paper Chase family\nHi we're Angela Tucker and Lauren Domino. Together we wrote this film PAPER CHASE inspired by teen comedies from our youth. We are planning to shoot this feature film in New Orleans in early summer 2016 and we need your help!\nWhat do you do when you\u2019ve alienated your entire graduating class and have a week to pay for college? Throw the ultimate house party. PAPER CHASE is a teen comedy that follows Alicia, an ideal driven, well-meaning if somewhat pretentious New Orleans teenager ready to reinvent herself at Kensington University in Atlanta.\nWhen her college dormitory balance is discovered unpaid, Alicia and her hardworking but cash-strapped, single mom Valerie must find a way to procure the funds. Completely unpopular, she turns to her best friend, Jamila, an outspoken, charismatic fashionista who steps in to throw the affair and mend Alicia\u2019s relationships before they leave for college.\nWhile Alicia\u2019s mom, Valerie, makes the rounds asking various family members and friends for monetary assistance, the girls must hatch a plan to get 100 people to attend while battling new friends, future ex-boyfriends and the hipster art collective across the street.\nWHY PAPER CHASE/ WHAT\u2019S THE INSPIRATION\nWe\u2019ve looked at the statistics regarding women in film, particularly women of color working in the film industry and the abysmal rate in which our projects get financed and made. Instead of getting depressed by these figures we got inspired and decided to create a project by black women; focusing on black female friendships. PAPER CHASE is the result of this inspiration.\nOwning that the black experience isn\u2019t monolithic this project speaks to black life we haven\u2019t seen on camera before. The film\u2019s lead characters are all women of color, actively working to take control of their lives and sexuality. It\u2019s important to us to show the experience of black women on screen not of suffering but of comedic joy and agency. PAPER CHASE is a film in which women of color can identify and see themselves fully represented on screen. New Orleans and it\u2019s influences also bring a lot to the story, and while our city is getting some media attention, the story is never told by people from the city. Though many film productions utilize the city, New Orleans appears to be little more than a backdrop. Rarely do films depict the city in all of its complexities. Filmed in locations all over the city, PAPER CHASE touches upon issues like race, gentrification and class through a comedic lens.\nCREATIVE INFLUENCES\nLike many socially awkward young people, we were obsessed with teen films. Here are some of our biggest influences when writing our film.\nBut what are all of these films missing ...\nCreated by our incredible intern!\nSO we decided to make a film featuring girls like us!\nThrough our company, TuckerGurl we've made some other great projects:\nOur webseries about to begin it's fourth season\nFeature length documentary available on Netflix, Hulu, iTunes\n                   The cast and crew photo from our most recent short, Just The Three Of Us\nNow we can't wait to get started on our newest adventure!\n#CREATE IN COLOR\nWe\u2019ve created the hashtag, #createincolor to build an online community and champion the work of other creative of color. We\u2019ve even emblazoned our tote bag with this call action to show we\u2019re here making dope ass content that people want to see. Join the movement! \nYou can purchase this with the $30 reward\nREWARDS\nWe have many great rewards names after the streets of our story. They include a streaming link of the completed film, a DJ mix made by our Music Supervisor, Rusty Lazer and our Paper Chase Zine including behind the scenes images, thoughts short stories from cast and crew and other creatives of color, and the struggle to make money as an art includes stories on the craziest thing we've done for money to fund a project. Some people contributing to the zine are Baratunde Thurston, Stephanie McKay and more artists to come!\nWHAT IS THIS MONEY FOR?\nWe need this money to go into production for our film. It will be used to pay crew, to feed crew, to secure locations, all the things needed to produce a film. Filmmaking isn't cheap and believe us, we are making this film for as little as possible. These funds partnered with some additional funding from outside sources will help us to our shoot this summer.\nHOW YOU CAN HELP\n1) BACK THE PROJECT at whatever level you can. Every contribution counts!\n2) SPREAD THE WORD! Crowdfunding is about lots of people getting together to donate modest amounts of money. So, please, share our page on Twitter and Facebook.

It's an incredible story about a troubled teenage girl who runs into someone that changes her life forever. The events that take place not only changes her outlook on life but also gives her the inner strength she never knew she had.\nThe main protagonist is 14 year old Inez Jozlyn. She was born and raised out in Queensbridge, a rough housing project in the New York City borough of Queens. The title \"Tephlon Funk!\" means in order to overcome obstacles in life, you need to be strong and stand out among the crowd.\nIllustrated By David Tako\nI'm a huge fan of Hip Hop & Anime. I always felt that there weren't enough stories out there that were able to successfully mix the two mediums seamlessly. Bring the best of both worlds into one dope project. \nAnimatic by Adam Temple\nI wanted the story to take place in New York City. Specifically Queensbridge since this was heavily inspired by \"Illmatic.\" I've never seen an NYC based cartoon that really captured the true essence of living in this big city.\nI thought \"Why not have the lead character be someone down to earth that's believable and people care about?\" which is what influenced me to put together \"Tephlon Funk!\"\nIllustrated by David Tako\nIllustrated by David Tako\nAn Artist and Writer from New York City. His inspirations include Akira Toriyama, Osamu Tezuka, Katsuhiro Otomo, Bengus, Akiman, Kentaro Miura & Hayao Miyazaki.  \nStephane\u2019s biggest influence would have to be Nas. Specifically his 1994 debut album \"Illmatic\" which finally pushed him to create \"Tephlon Funk!\u201d\nThis is his 1st project which he hopes to help inspire and influence others. A true fan of both Hip Hop and Anime. Over 10 years later, he\u2019s now ready to take the next step.\nA French Artist from Paris, France born and raised loving animated movies, comics, mangas and video games. He's always had a great passion for Japan and Japanese culture. \nHis favorite inspirations are Satoshi Kon, Naoki Urasawa, Hayao Miyazaki, Yoshiyuki Sadamoto and Toshihiro Kawamoto.\nAfter animation school, he's worked on mobile video games and several animation projects. Now he\u2019s Illustrating and doing character design for \"Tephlon Funk!\" along with his personal French comic influenced by manga called \"Lapsis\"\nA French Graffiti Artist from Paris who grew up with Franco-Belgian traditional comics \u2018till he discovered mangas and American comics strips. A true slap.\nHis inspirations come from Hip Hop culture, especially the 90\u2019s, along with Katsuhiro Otomo, Humberto Ramos, William Vance, Masamune Shirow, Yoshiaki Kawajiri, Fransisco Herrera, Uderzo and many others!\nSince animation school, he\u2019s working with a collective of Artists teaching graffiti and drawing to kids in Youth Centers, doing canvas, walls frescoes for City Halls, associations, or himself. He\u2019s also working with his bro\u2019 Tako on a \u201cfew things\u201d you probably heard about now!\nAll in all, we're just artists who have a huge passion in Anime, Manga, and great music. Which is what makes this project so important to us.\nThrough Kickstarter, I wish to self publish this 130 page book and show that people are looking for a great story which not only they can relate to, but one that has a diverse set of characters. \nThere are not enough cartoons out there that are really pushing the envelope.

The dynamic gameplay partly inspired by the old school \u2018Tales of\u2019 series, focuses on 2D real-time combat sequences while the narration and its environment both draw deeply from African culture, myths and lores.\nIt should have been a perfect day for Enzo Kori-Odan, Prince of Zama. He was scheduled to marry his lifelong love Erine Evou and be crowned the new King. Little did he know that Ngarba Evou, his new brother-in-law, plotted to overthrow him.\nThrough thrillingly executed, combo-heavy action sequences, Erine and Enzo will redefine their bond, rescue the land from its villains, and restore their legacy. Luckily, Enzo can call on the Aurion, a powerful collective energy channelled from past ancestors that can unlock devastating fighting abilities and combos to help him beat his foes.\nJoin the world of Auriona that stands apart from most any other video game universe. The adventure awaits you.  \nEnzo is the only remaining heir of the Kori-Odan family, which ruled over the city of Zama for generations. Enzo inherited his battle gears from former Zama\u2019s kings. He can modify its gear\u2019s properties by drawing on ancestral energy, the Aurion, which can also be used to put Enzo into a fierce Aurionic state, allowing him to take on even the deadliest of foes. Luckily for Enzo, his spear, Urithi, also has a power of its own. It is strong and equipped with its own special Aurionite, which is linked to the Legacy of the Kori-Odan.\n\"Protect your Legacy Bravely\"\n\nErine is the young spouse of Enzo Kori-Odan, and fights alongside him in his quest to restore his legacy. Erine is a support character, she can heal her husband and launch special attack to combo with. Her primary piece of equipment is called \"Moyoni Ukuta\" which means \"The wall of the heart\". It is an Aurionic shield that can absorb physical AND magical damage.  \nAlthough Erine cannot enter an Aurionic state, she is equipped with a chest harness and a loin cloth with interchangeable Aurionites. She can mix the Aurionites to modify her abilities.\n\"Wall of The Heart\"\nThere are various enemies and bosses in Aurion. Enzo and Erine will face them throughout the adventure, more powerful and skilled as the couple advance in their quest.\nThe Bestiary\nSome Bosses!\nAurion's gameplay combines African legends and lore with fast-paced real-time combat.\nGather your legacy, unlock devastating strikes to combo with, and mix aurions to create new ones.\n Confront enemies as Enzo, with Erine\u2019s assistance and make the best out of the couple in combat.\nPowerful duels with fascinating and immersive dialogues.\nJoin a spiritual quest that takes our heroes to journey across a wonderful world of African fantasy.\nAuriona is a rich and dynamic planet made of six continents. The world\u2019s population regroups six main ethnic groups which are connected by an exciting common history line. Travel around to discover the wealth of the Kiro\u2019o Tales throughout many side quests.\nArtwork\nThe Aurion is at the same time a mystery and an evidence in Auriona. The Aurion is based on the energetic waves of the world's memory, in other words it channels the energy of the past. With the Aurion, Enzo and other Aurionic people can enter aurionic states to unlock thier fighting potential together with devastating abilities related to ancestors.\nAurionites are objects in which there is the Aurion in the likes of Urithi, Enzo's spear. They allow their possessors to boost their abilities. Originally, the Aurionites constitute rich and complex energy sources used mainly for domestic purposes. But the situation on Auriona saw the Aurion and its Aurionites being used as military weapons. Due to the Aurionites, non-Aurionics people can now build their capacities, and even use the power of the elements.\n                                                                   You can also fin us here: Facebook KIRO'O  -  Google+\nKotaku \"Not every \"Fantasy\" World has to be European\" http://kotaku.com/not-every-fantasy-world-has-to-be-european-1685083542 \nPolygon \"A game that speaks of Africa\" http://www.polygon.com/2015/3/30/8297515/africa-draft \nSiliconera \"Action-RPG Aurion, Legacy of The Kori-Odan is Set in an African Fantasy World\" http://www.siliconera.com/2015/03/06/action-rpg-aurion-legacy-of-the-kori-odan-is-set-in-an-african-fantasy-world/ \nIndiemag.fr \"Aurion, d\u00e9couverte d'un A-RPG ambitieux en provenance du Cameroun !\" http://www.indiemag.fr/articles/aurion-decouverte-dun-arpg-ambitieux-provenance-du-cameroun \nRPG FRANCE \"Aurion trouve la lumi\u00e8re verte\" en r\u00e9f\u00e9rence au Greenlight obtenu sur Steam le 02 Mars 2015 http://www.rpgfrance.com/actu-13860-1-aurion-trouve-lumiere-verte-maj#post9\nThe Kiro'o Team\nWe are twenty young Cameroonians working on the project, one the few, if not the only, game developer in Cameroon.

Choose one of the PS4 reward tiers to reserve your copy!\n***\nFULLY FUNDED IN 5 DAYS! THANK YOU, BACKERS!\nWe still have plenty of fun stretch goals to reach. Please keep spreading the word!\nYou are a dog, lost in a sprawling and unfamiliar city. You wander the streets, searching for scraps, for shelter, for a friendly face. Slowly, you overcome some of your fears. You learn where you can snag a meaty bone, where you can sleep warm and safe at night. Strange streets become familiar territory. One by one, the streets become yours. You find friends. Eventually, maybe, home.\nProjected Release: Fall 2016 on Mac, Windows and PS4\nHome Free is an open-world action-RPG starring a dog lost in a sprawling, randomly generated city. Use your canine abilities to explore this strange, sometimes hostile environment and find your place in the world.\nI've been working on Home Free for about two years now, and I'm very excited to show you where I've taken it so far. This project is the culmination of a lot of work and a bunch of crazy interests: procedural content, urbanism, quadrupedal locomotion, and dogs -- how they play, the stories we tell about them, and what makes them tick.\nFeatures\nBe a dog in an unexplored city!\nPlay as any of over a dozen breeds (plus many more color and marking variations). Maybe even more, depending on stretch goals and rewards!\nExplore a dense, procedurally-generated city unique to your game. Every street, alleyway, building, nook and cranny was generated just for your game. No one has been here before, so you better start marking your territory.\nPlayer-driven narrative. Shape the story of one dog's survival through your choices and actions. Experience the the world from the perspective a creature who will never quite understand why that world acts the way it does.\nWrestle, wriggle, and pounce. Home Free features a full range of canine moves to master, whether you're playing with friendly dogs in a local park or escaping the aggressions of territorial dogs in a dark alley.\nLearn the unique rhythms of your city. Which neighborhood has the tastiest garbage just after sunset? What park empties at mid-day so you and your dog friends can have a fun romp when no one's around?\nDecide how to survive. Will you be a bandit, stealing food from unsuspecting humans when you can? A performer, trying to earn treats and sympathy from dog-friendly citizens? Or a scavenger, sticking to the margins and following your nose?\nDog it up with your friends in real life! Home Free comes bundled with my local multiplayer dog wrasslin' game, Dog Park, included at all backer levels!\nA dog is always hungry. To survive in the big city, you'll need to decide how best to satisfy your doggy hunger.\nA World Made For Humans...\nThe city is noisy, crowded and surprising, built for two-legged creatures whose ways are hard to understand. Some seem friendly. Can you get them to share their food? Others run screaming when they see you. Maybe they want you to chase them? Some attack on sight, with hands and sticks and boots. What\u2019s your best escape route? Noisy metal boxes fly by in unpredictable patterns. Are you fast enough to dodge them? It\u2019s their city, but you can still master its streets.\nA time lapse of the city generator at work. Every game gets its own unique city. No strategy guides or FAQs will help you here. You are truly lost.\n...A World Full of Dogs\nYou're far from the only one of your kind in this place. Other dogs prowl the streets. Some protect their territory and won't let you pass without a fight. Some are wary and keep their distance. Some could be friends. A sniff, a chase, and a romp through a park is all it takes to seal a friendship. And who knows, maybe one friendship can lead to another\u2026\nAll trailer footage was captured in-game from a pre-alpha build of Home Free.\nHome Free is a beautiful, heartbreaking single player experience, but it also comes bundled with a raucous multiplayer mode: DOG PARK!\nDog Park is a 4-player, local multiplayer dog wrasslin' game, and it comes with Home Free! Become a dog as you chase, wrestle, cavort and gambol with other players in a chaotic struggle to have as much fun as you can.  \nThe new, improved version of Dog Park included with Home Free will feature a bunch of new game modes, improved controls and physics, as well as all the new dog breeds added to Home Free.\nDog Park installed at No Quarter 2014 in New York.\nI created Dog Park for the NYU Game Center's yearly No Quarter show, and debuted it there in September 2014. Dog Park is a game about my fascination with the dynamics of dog play.\nDogs are possibly the world's best game players: they have a huge appetite for play, they manage to negotiate new games with each other without using language, and they seem to play games for the sheer joy of it, not really caring who wins or who loses. Dog Park is my attempt to recreate some of that experience for four humans at a time, in videogame form.\nThe version of Dog Park shown at No Quarter (and at the IndieCade 2014 E-Sports Showcase) was an experimental game about canine play. The \"winner\" of the game is the dog who had the most fun, and fun comes in many forms: chasing and being chased, wrestling with other dogs, playing king of the hill on a picnic table.\nThe final version of Dog Park, included as part of Home Free, will feature several new game modes that offer new goals and new reasons to unleash your furry fury with three other friends.\nHome Free features a brand new, original soundtrack composed by Mark Robinson!\nMark founded the Teen-Beat record label and has been a member of the bands Unrest, Air Miami, Flin Flon, Cotton Candy, and Fang Wizard. \nMark's music is what this game has sounded like in my head since I first started prototyping it over two years ago. If it ever turned into a real game, I knew I'd have to ask him to work on the soundtrack. I had no plan B. It's an amazing feeling to have one of my favorite artists making music for my game, and I'm very, very excited about it.\nThe music in the trailer is a track Mark made just for this Kickstarter campaign. He's already shared some early sketches for songs that will become part of the final soundtrack, and there's so much good stuff in there.\nDo dogs even like music? I don't know. But I know I already can't imagine Home Free without it.\nThe Game\nA DRM-Free digital copy of Home Free (including Dog Park), on Mac or PC.\nDigital Wallpapers\nA collection of high-res wallpapers featuring cute digital dogs for your computer or phone. (Image for illustration purposes only -- there will be more, and different!)\nStickers\nA set of 5 full-color, die-cut vinyl stickers of sweet low-poly dogs. Stick 'em on your laptop or wherever else people stick sticky things.(Image for illustration purposes only)\nT-Shirt\nChoose one of two designs (or pick the $95 tier for both) of cool polygonal dogs doing cool polygonal dog things!\nBe In the Game\nSend me a photo and I'll use magic to digitize you into an abstract, low-poly human NPC who will play an important role in the city. Includes a few high res screenshots of your digital doppelganger in various poses so you can show off to your friends.\nYour Dog In The Game\nI create a fully customized, stylized low-poly playable version of your dog in the game! Just send me some photos, a couple measurements, and a quick description, and I'll interpret your dog as a cartoony, low-poly playable character. Comes with a collection of high res images of your dog in action and in funny poses.\nPlease note the some dogs are more compatible with Home Free's art style than others. If you're wondering whether your dog would be a good choice, message me!\nThe Full Digital Best Friend Experience\nI create a custom, playable version of your dog and a custom, NPC version of you. I also create an ultra-exclusive, fully customized ambient minigame experience featuring digital you and your digital companion spending some quality time relaxing alone in the park together.\nI've been working on this project for approximately two years. Dog Park debuted in September, 2014 at No Quarter in New York City, and was shown again at IndieCade 2014 in the E-Sports Showcase.\nAbout a year before work began on Dog Park, I started experimenting with building a procedural city engine. Walking around in this dense, twisty, mysterious place felt great almost immediately, and I kept experimenting even though I didn't really know what I was going to do with it.\nHome Free is the combination of these two projects: Dog Park provides the dogs, and the city project provides the world you'll explore.\nAt this point, all of that is working well; the trailer was made entirely from in-game footage captured from a pre-alpha build. I've spent my time so far building out the skeleton for Home Free -- an engine that creates vibrant procedurally-generated open world city environments and a system for dog movement, interaction, and control.\nThe fundamentals are now in place, and with your help, I'll spend the next year building out more content, deepening single player gameplay, and tuning controls.\nWhat's Next?\nGameplay programming. Flesh out and add content to the game's core systems of exploration, hunger management, and character development.\nScenario design. Create semi-scripted situations for the player character to encounter in the world: patrolling aggressive dogs, friendly humans with specific requirements, unfriendly humans, NPC-to-NPC interactions that create opportunities for food and advancement.\nCity content and generator refinement. Create a bunch more city assets to avoid randomly-generated \"sameness\" problem. Define larger number of \"neighborhood\" types (currently there are only two) to create more variation and local flavor (similar to \"biomes\" in Minecraft).\nDog modeling and animation. Create at least 5 additional dog body types (maybe more depending on stretch goals and rewards!). Continue building out library of dog behaviors, interactions, and movements.\nI've brought this project pretty far over the past couple years. I've laid the groundwork for a game I'm excited to play, a world I want to spend time in, and a chance to see that world from my favorite animal's perspective. \nWhat I need now is the ability to focus entirely on this crazy idea to see it through to conclusion. So far, all the code, art, animation, and game design has been done by me, on my own. The funds from Kickstarter will allow me to get help on the things I'm not so good at, like music and sound, will enable me to invest in the tools and software I need to make this thing shine, and give me the opportunity to work full-time on Home Free until it's done.\nKevin Cancienne @potatojin\nGame Design, Art, Animation & Programming\nKevin is an independent game developer based in New York.

Mark's latest project is a film series of interesting retail spaces called STO.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAll projects come with risks, and videogames have a unique way of combining all the risks of a creative endeavor with all the risks of software engineering. Home Free is no different.\n\nThe biggest risk to Home Free, as described here, is to its schedule. Software projects sometimes take longer than anticipated, and I want to be honest about that possibility here. I'm helped by the fact that I'm not starting from scratch -- there's over two years' worth of groundwork already laid here. I estimate honestly that another year of steady work fleshing out gameplay, adding content, testing and prepping for release will get me to the finish line. But things go wrong, and I'm only human, so it might all take longer than I want.\n\nAnother \"risk\" that's inherent to all game projects is the risk that elements of the design will change and evolve over the course of the project. Game design is an iterative process, and the process of building, testing, playing, re-building, and re-playing has a way of overturning your early assumptions. This is the beauty of game design, but I also want to be clear with you, my backers, that Home Free is a work in progress, and as it gets better and more complete, it will also evolve. I hope you'll want to join me on that journey.\n\nI've been making games for more than 15 years. In that time, I've shipped nearly 30 of them. I've applied that experience to the planning that's gone into this project, and I'm going to continue to apply it overcome any of the obstacles I'm sure to face in bringing this project to life. I'm also extremely fortunate to be surrounded by an incredible community of talented game developers here in New York.

The fighting mechanics focus on fast-paced combat, strategic use of your environment, and weapons in the arena. Here are the key features (more depending on stretch goals!):\nHigh-Powered Combat from 1v1 to 4 player battle royale or team modes\nPhysics-based environment destruction and interactive ragdolls\nOriginal Characters with fun, unique movesets and strengths\nCombat Cores can boost fighter stats and grant special attacks to fit your play style!\nLocal Multiplayer + Online Multiplayer using Exit Game's Photon Networking Framework\nInteractive Arenas with a variety of mechanics and hazards\nWeapon Pickups ranging from lazer swords to energy grenade launchers, with multiple attacks and uses\nFull Character Editor to create custom fighters with different gear, stats, and skills\nOculus Rift Compatible - The first fighting game with native Oculus Rift support!\nCombat Core's fighting system is influenced by a myriad of classic brawlers from the 90's and early 2000's:\nThe free roaming 3D movement, pickups, and interactive arenas of Power Stone and 4-player free-for-all brawling from Power Stone 2.\nHit, grab, block, parry system and easy combo mixups similar to Dead or Alive and Soul Calibur 2.\nFull custom character editor w/ a slew of abilities and stats similar to Custom Robo and classic AKI wrestling games like Wrestlemania 2000 and No Mercy.\nEnergy-based attacks and lightning quick combat influenced by  Dragon Ball Z.\nFull 3D Player Movement \nUnlike most conventional fighting games, Combat Core's battles take place in a 3-Dimensional arena where players can move and jump in any direction at any time.\nThe game supports both a gamepad and keyboard/mouse setup.\nAttacks are executed by tapping or long pressing (hold for .5 seconds and release) the attack buttons.\nSelect from a cast of 8 original characters or your own custom-created characters.\nThe basic battle uses a 3-stock setup per battle, and when a fighter has been knocked out 3 times, they are eliminated from the fight. The last man/team standing wins!\nUtilize light, heavy, core attacks, weapons, and even the environment to damage your foes and obtain victory!\nPicking up energy orbs will increase your meter regeneration! Shield guards and evasion rolls can be used for defensive tactics. Using your guard uses energy meter and will break quickly!\nIf the timer reaches zero, the death lazers will spawn and slowly force players to move to the center of the stage, or die instantly!\nThe world of Combat Core is a colorful mix of modern aesthetics and futuristic cyberpunk. Fighters from across the galaxy have gathered to compete in the ARENA Combat League to prove their skills and strength!\nIn addition to their combat prowess, fighters are equipped with special energy cores to boost their fighting abilities and grant them special skills. In the arcade/campaign modes, players will learn the history of every fighter and their motives for competing!\nUse the character editor to create your own characters!\nIn addition to the core roster, players will be able to create their own custom characters and compete! Select from a wide variety of accessories and skills to fit your playstyle, and prove your strength!\n4 new characters designed by Alex Ahad will be added to the game if the stretch goal is met!\nThe scope of Combat Core has always been focused and within reasonable limits of the team's available resources, but there are a handful of great new ideas that we want to develop! With these stretch goals, there is a variety of new content we can commit to completing!\nHere are some of the talented voice actors that were casted for Combat Core, courtesy of our casting director Chris Niosi. More announcements for the remaining roster will come in the future!\nCurtis Arnott (Bruizer) - Widely known online as \"Takahata101\" and his work for the DBZ and Hellsing Abridged series as Creative Director of Team Four Star. Also, he recently did voices for Dragonball Xenoverse.\nMichele Knotz (Pugi) - Michele has an extensive resume of voicing a multitude of Pok\u00e9mon characters for Nintendo, and voiced in various anime such as To Heart and Genshiken. She also voiced Alisa in Street Fighter X Tekken.\nChris Guerrero (Jondo) - Featured in the \"Death Battle\" Youtube series, Chris has also done voices for One Piece, the TOME animated series and DBZ Abridged.\nBrittany Lauda (Skatie) - Brittany was recently featured in HuniePop as Audrey, and other games including Strife (Blazer) and Heroes of Newerth (URSA Magmus, Grizzington)\n\nSandra Espinoza (Ember) - Sandra voiced the popular female class mods for Team Fortress 2 and has been featured in other games including Apotheon and Supreme League of Patriots.\nMusic in Combat Core will feature an electric blend of hand-selected tracks and original new tracks from a variety of outstanding artists! With funding, we are in line to license tracks from several artists including Falcon Funk, DJ Butcher, and Panda Eyes.\nHere are a few tracks that will be featured if the game is funded!\nIn addition to hand-picked licensed tracks, Yoav Landau \"The Living Tombstone\" and Bad Catholics will also be producing some new original tracks!\nThe track used in the Kickstarter trailer is Yoav's instrumental for \"Quarter Master\":\nCombat Core has been in development since 2013, and most of the combat mechanics are implemented and working. The game has already been greenlit on Steam, and approved for the developer programs for Microsoft's Xbox One and the Nintendo Wii U. The game is progressing very well, but will need several more months in development to make it a complete product. This Kickstarter campaign is to help get the game to the finish line!\nVisual improvements from the January 2015 build (left) and January 2014 build (right)\nCombat Core has been completely self-funded so far, but extra funding is needed to cover cost of several things:\nMore Art Assets and Game Features - There are still a lot of art assets needed to finish the game! There are several more character models, weapons, and environments still being created. The kickstarter will cover the cost of creating and improving 2D illustration/concepts , environment and character models, animations, and special effects.\nMusic and Sound Production/Licensing - Combat Core will feature a fantastic EDM-heavy soundtrack produced by a variety of contributing artists. Funding will cover the cost for music licenses and production.\nVoice Casting/Directing - We need to cover the costs for casting and recording voices for all the characters and other voice clips like the announcer(s)\nLiving Expenses - Without funding, Combat Core will be shifted to a part-time project and I will need to focus on other jobs to make a living and to pay my partners for their work, and completing the project will take much longer.\n ***INFO ON CONSOLE ADD-ON PLEDGING***\nWe plan to distribute alpha builds to backers and utilize Steam Early Access in the future, but these avenues are not available for console releases. For this reason, ALL backers will receive the PC/Mac version rewards. If the console port stretch goals are reached, we will allow $5 add-on pledges (per key) to receive keys for the console of your choice when it releases.\nRewards are detailed in each pledge description, here's a chart to easily compare them!\nAlso, Alex Ahad \u201co_8\u201d (Character Design) is an amazing artist and the creative director of the smash-hit indie fighting game Skullgirls. If the $60k stretch goal is met, he's contributing 4 additional character designs in Combat Core! You can view more of his work on his Twitter, Tumblr, and Deviantart.\nI started full-time development of Combat Core in Summer 2013. Most of the gameplay systems are in place and the game is playable. Most of the development moving forward will be for adding/producing new art assets, attacks, music, bugfixing, balancing, and polishing the presentation to the existing framework. Barring any significant setback, here is the projected roadmap for the release of the game:\nQ2-3 2015 - Immediately after the Kickstarter, a private, DRM-free pre-release build will be released to $25-tier and higher backers. The current build has 5 original characters, 4 stages, 4 weapon types and several custom character options. Expect new builds to be released about every 2-6 weeks with new content.\nQ4 2015 - The game will be publicly released on Steam and other available digital storefronts, and backers at the $13-tier and above will receive their keys. This will be the \"early access\" release, and the game will continue to be updated regularly. Minimum features targeted for this release are:\n8 original characters playable (possibly more)\n6 arenas (possibly more)\nOnline multiplayer\nMore weapons and custom character assets\nQ1 2016 - The game and content (all characters, weapons, modes, arenas) are complete, and bugs/presentation have been polished as much as reasonably possible. The PDF guide and soundtrack should be complete, and the game will be \"released\" as version 1.0. Some stretch goals such as Extra Modes may be completed post-1.0 release, and the game will be ported to consoles.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nMost of the groundwork for Combat Core is already in place. The game is playable and we have an efficient pipeline to continue to add new content.\n\nHowever we understand that game development will always have unique hurdles, so there is always the possibilities of production delays due to all kinds of life situations. There may be technical hurdles but we are certain we will have the resources to deliver on all promised features.\n\nWe have a clear roadmap to delivery. An early access build should be released in 2015 and the full-featured release in early 2016.

It has a branching story path and several endings. Each ending illuminates different parts of Wendy\u2019s history, rather than having a \u201cwin\u201d or \u201close\u201d condition. The game is designed so a single story path can be completed from start-to-finish in one sitting, depending on your reading speed.\nThe completed game will be sold on itch.io for $5. We will go through the Greenlight process to potentially get the game onto Steam. All backers that give $5 or more will receive a DRM-free copy of the game upon release.\nIf you want to mention this campaign on your website, you can make use of our press kit. Send us a message too and let us know!\nTrigger is built in Ren'Py, which has cross-platform support for Windows, Mac, and Linux. Update! If we get at least $800 above our original funding goal, we will release the game on Android and iOS. $800 is the bare minimum we can squeak by with extra dev time and app store fees.\n You can download a demo of the game here.\nAmy Dentata is a writer, game designer, and performer who has released a number of notable free indie games, including A Night in the Woods (here's a great writeup, archived for now), 10 Seconds in Hell, and Rock Bottom.\nStolencomputer is an artist that loves working on arty, story-driven games, and painting in a colorful, illustrative style.\nWendy is a 30-something housewife struggling to pull her life together. Due to financial troubles, she just lost the house she grew up in. Although she feels depressed and listless most of the time, she remembers being edgy and carefree as a teen and wonders what happened. \nRick is a military vet who somewhat regrets his time in the service. He was looking forward to a peaceful, predictable life of work, love, and videogames right before they lost the house. He's not sure Wendy is the same person he married.\n\"I was blown away by the craft and nuance of each storyline. None felt 'better' or more 'complete' than the others, but each revealed just enough of Wendy's trauma to feel resolved by the end.\"\n\"It's really good. I don't think I'll be sleeping anymore tonight.\"\n\"You're really good at ripping feelings out of people.\"\nThe story and story scripting are completed, and most of the music and sound effects are done. Stolencomputer is working on gorgeous 720p graphics for the game. Meanwhile, I will finish composing and mixing music and sound effects, incorporate the graphics into the existing script, polish the final experience, and test the game to make sure it runs on all platforms.\nHere's an outline of what's completed and what remains:\nFunding from Kickstarter will allow Stolencomputer and myself to dedicate ourselves to the game without worrying about bills. This game has been an off-hours \"passion project\" up until now, but I want to pay my artist a fair rate for his work, and allow myself to finish the game without taking contract work on the side.\nThe funds from this campaign will be divided between myself and Stolencomputer, to pay for living expenses while working on the game. My artist will take approximately three months to get the rest of the graphics finished. After that I will work for a month to add final polish, put the art assets into the game, and publish.\nThe soundtrack (a backer reward) will take a month longer for me to finish and release after the game is released. I will do that work pro-bono (it's not included in this budget). Since these are digital releases, they will not incur shipping or materials costs.\nHere's a breakdown of our funding allocation:\nI believe in visual novels as a potent storytelling medium and I'd love to see their audience and range of expression expand.

It combines elements of action role playing games such as the Zelda series (picking up objects) with battle scenes that any Final Fantasy fan will be familiar with (turn based, similar layout, etc) and rounding out the visuals is a great comic book style of artwork..\u201d\nCyber from Death by Beta, October 10, 2014\n\u201cCelestial Tear: Demon\u2019s Revenge is a throw back to the old JRPGs of the earlier 16-bit console era that were so well loved.\u201d\nMy name is Tyrell White and with the help of my wife, Whitney, we are the co-founders of the indie development team known as White Guardian Studios. We are game enthusiasts who love making games even more than we love playing them. We have three kids who love the idea of making games as much as we do, probably because that is what they have seen us do since they were born. \nMaking games has become a lifestyle for us. It is what we do for fun and what we have always envisioned ourselves doing as a career ever since we met at the Art Institute of Pittsburgh. \nWe have been developing Demon's Revenge off and on for about 4 years now. We have taken time to hone our skills in developing the exact project we have always envisioned from the beginning. Now we are ready to get this game done! As much as a love letter this game is to the classics we respect and enjoy, it is also one for the relationship my wife and I have. We are gamers and we love games. It is a passion that we want to share with the world.\nWe are determined to make this game a reality. Since we are a much smaller developer than most others who launch kickstarter campaigns, we feel that we do not have a large fan base to raise a lot of money. Our solution is to make the game into chapters releasing each new part in a bi-monthly portion of the game. Each part will have a satisfying conclusion and end with a motion comic. We plan to spread the game out in 5 parts and the 1st chapter will be released 1st quarter 2015, if we make our goal.\nWe feel this also solves a problem with RPG gamers who do not really feel they have a lot of time to play these types of games. By having these chapters, you can still have fun and complete the game while still having an attachment to your party members in each new installment throughout the year.\nThe Celestial Tear is a universe we created to tell the stories of all the games we've planned to create. Demon's Revenge will be the catalyst in which all the other stories are based on and it will expand into a unique and diverse universe to explore through our games.\nWe want this game to transcend past the troupes of characters that most are used to in this genre of games. We want to offer the player a very diverse cast who all have their different cultures and views on the world.\nDiversity in gaming is rising and we want to be apart of that movement by creating a game that not only addresses diversity, but also expands on both the positives and negativity that comes with what may seem like a taboo in gaming.\nOn Hasphal, humans rule the world. Jehts, a race dissimilar to humanity, are forced to the harsh regions of the world as decreed by the human Gods the Gaddock. You play in a world lost in time. Traditions have started to dissolve and places thought to be sacred are being explored and excavated. Relics of a great ancestor begin to surface and religions and a way of life is challenged. New technology has surfaced and the age of the Gaddoks begin to fade as the jehts are ready to claim the world as their own.\nYou play as a very diverse group of characters; humans and jehts all coming from different walks of life. Gain different perspectives of the conflicts going on in the world and find out the truth about the world of Hasphal.\nChapter One: In the beginning, there was Sen...\nIn the town of Nionlah lived a quiet, unusual little girl. That girl was Sen. She was different but no one could quite put a finger on it. She looked normal. Lived with a normal family, but no one quite felt that she belonged; not even Sen herself. She felt no connection to anyone around her, coming off as rude and sarcastic. She trusted no one. Only Sen knew the true torment that twisted her soul and rotted her mind. All her life, she was plagued by dreams of torture and pain.  \nYears had passed and she began to form a strong bond with her brother Niraku. She trusted him and since they grew up together, she felt he was the only one to understand her. Soon her normal life would end, and what Sen truly was would emerge. Awaking from another one of her frightening episodes, she found herself drenched in water standing deviously over her drowned brother. Outraged and blind by the apparent genocide of their beloved child, Sen's parents screamed \"Demon!\"\nOrigin Forest\nLife for Sen changed. Her life unhinged from beneath her. Hunted as a lowly animal and labeled worse than the ground she tread on, Sen felt driven and pulled into the only place she knew no one would come looking for her. The forbidden Origin Forest.\nYears have passed. Surviving on her instincts and living off the land, Sen managed to sustain an existence. Legends of her presence as a demon led many to hunt her down in pursuit of fame and honor. Losing all hope and grip on humanity, she vows to become the monster everyone wants her to be... Until one day an unprepared demon ridder named Jagen sees more in her heart than she thought she had left.\nSen:\nWith every last fiber of her body, Sen only knows survival. Her life is vague. Plagued by dreams of horror and frustration of what she believes them to be. Having betrayed the only family she'd known by killing her brother, she seeks no truths and accepts the inevitability that she will always be hunted as a demon.\nJagen:\nBorn with nobility Jagen has been bred with the finest teachings and training. Jagen\u2019s family and culture have pressured him to hate what he does not understand, jehts. Jagen could not protect his wife against them. He found his wife brutally murdered by jehts. Stricken with grief, unable to slay the \u201cdemon\u201d that did this to her, he puts up arms. Not in revenge for his wife, but to defend anyone these creatures would come to harm. So he joins the ridders, Hasphal\u2019s elite defenders, to protect the ones who need protecting.\nJynx:\nGrowing up, Jynx has always been able to hide the fact that he is a jeht. He could blend in with hasphalians by changing form and looking like one of them. He attended school with them, worked with them, he wanted to be just like them. Jynx even fell in love with one of them, but that all felt like a lie to Jynx and he could not live his life that way. Accepting that jehts and hasphalians could not live together, Jynx travels like a nomad living with both hasphalians and jehts, trying to find a place for himself in the world.\nFeatures \n\u2022 An intriguing storyline filled with themes of discovery, morals, and the common good vs evil tearing into those shades of gray\n\u2022 Fun and enticing gameplay with 3 different characters to join your party \n\u2022 A dynamic day and night system that effects gameplay \n\u2022 An action packed, strategic battle system\n\u2022 Unique crafting systems and minigames\nExploration\nWe want exploration to feel exciting. We want you to be surprised when you stumble upon something cool, when you take the less beaten path. The things you come across will tell more about the lore of the world and help you get a better understanding of some things on your journey.\nWe want everything to be explorable so there is swimming, jumping and climbing to increase your engagement in the game. We feel games should be played, not watched. So we felt these additions were a critical part of our project.\nCombat\nThe combat system is a conditional turn based battle system (CTB). The CTB is a turn-based system which does not operate in rounds, instead it uses an action list, which can be effected through various means throughout the battle, similar to Final Fantasy 10.\nThe main goal of our battle system is to make it fun and strategic, so we added the element of special abilities and environmental interactions. Depending on a character\u2019s skills and abilities, this could mean a variety of things. You could cut down trees or knock down pillars and use them against your enemies before they can use it against you. Or in a more unique twist you or your enemy can be knocked into a table of vials turning you into a were wolf like creature for an undetermined amount of time.\nEach character has a varied set of skills and abilities that separate them from each other. In the final product you can build your character suitable to your play style all having different ways of effecting the battle and different ways of playing. Upon funding we will be able to complete this system having something similar to Legend of Dragoon's combo system.\nBattle colossal and creative creatures in our battle system!\nThere are different levels of enemies in Demon's Revenge. We have normal enemies which are the most common ones you will face. We also have a leveling system in which enemies difficulty will be based on the level they are. For example you can fight the same wolf but some may be higher or lower levels than the others thus giving each a varied set of attributes and cause you to use a more strategic approach to defeating them.\nWe have boss enemies which will pose a much greater threat than normal enemies of a selected area or event. They are very powerful and will need your parties skills to work together to defeat it.\nEpic creatures are found throughout the game. These would be the most dangerous foes to face. Although they are optional, there are rewards for defeating enemies of this quality. You may need to level up to defeat most of them. I believe our battle system will be fun enough for all players to actively seek out challenges like these and have a lot of fun.\n Menus and Crafting\nWe wanted to really separate ourselves from most JRPGs, so we adopted an art style that could be considered foreign to the genre. Our character art and cut scenes resemble that of a comic rather than some anime or manga. We feel it brings a more edgy, and more serious look and feel to the game and also makes it more action oriented.\nMost of our childhood took place in the 90s and that is where we gained a love for pixel art. We have been working and refining our skills in pixel art for the last few years. The skills we've earned make our game look vibrant and alive. We choose to use a bunch of animations for how the world would feel for all times of the day. \nThe music in Celestial Tear: Demon's Revenge is a very important aspect of the game's overall presentation. The music sets the tone and invokes emotion when played not only in game, but it holds it's own even when you're just listening.\n  Digital copy of the game\nDRM free copy of the game or steam key for all chapters of the game.\nKickstarter exclusive wallpapers\nDigital Manual\nSoundtrack\nDigital Art/Infobook\nDigital Strategy Guide\n    Digital Comic\nA compilation of all motion comics and videos in game for all chapters of the game.\nIn Game Painting\n  Create NPC\nCreate an NPC. Your NPC will have his/her own custom sprite, custom face portrait, house, daily routine, and dialogue. Choose from any of the vacant houses (You will see the vacant houses and their locations when you play the beta and will also receive a list of vacant houses and their layouts. Choose your NPC's standing on the issues between the humans and jehts.\nGive your character a real voice on Hasphal, help us decide on a voice actor or voice the NPC yourself.\n\nCreate a Boss\nGet your own custom boss design (Max size: 200px * 200px, Max abilities: 5 + regular attack if applicable) Create a human, jeht or other creative creature. Decide what alignment your boss follows. Is it pro human, pro jeht, neutral or an all out killing, fire breathing creature. Work with the developers to come up with a solid background story that ties into the games overall lore. \nCustom battle theme & HD wallpaper of your boss\nCreate Playable Character\nCreate a playable character. This will tie into the previous reward where the town or dungeon you create will be where your character is be found. Design his or her appearance and moral standing on the conflicts between the humans and jehts. Work with the developers to come up with a compelling back story, powers, abilities, and a field skill for your character. \nCustom battle theme & HD wallpaper of your character\n\nA big reason we keep coming back to this platform is the support we get from everyone letting us know it is okay to try again. We really want to make the game we envision and we can not do it on our own. We have three kids and I work really hard to support my family. I feel like this could be our break into the gaming world. I will gladly work hard to let the world see what we are made of. We have already put so much time and effort into getting the game into its current state, it would be a crime to give that up, especially with all the positive things said about our game. It is going to be much better once we are finally funded.\n\nWe have tried to fund the game completely and that has not worked out mainly because of our small reach and our time to promote is limited. So we are going with a smaller goal to fund and release the first part of the game. \n\nWhat ever we get over our goal, profit, or donations that we get after the first chapter will be used to fund the next installment. We already have a lot of assets for the first chapter in order to complete it. We need the remainder of the art and music, but most importantly optimization of the game so that it will run on older machines. We also need the remainder of the battle system completed. This gives us the piece of mind so that we will always be able to pay our artist, musician and coder without having to wait for extra money. The game can then move along smoothly without any delays. \n\nThe development cost is to help with some living expenses throughout the few months of development so that I can do a majority of the sprites needed to finish the first chapter. It allows me more time to really concentrate on getting the sprites animated and drawn the best they could be. A big part of our success will lie in the sprite animations. The more time and freedom we have, the better the game will be.\n\nWe went with all digital rewards as we have received a lot of feedback on our previous campaigns. Most people do not like the physical rewards because of the added shipping and this helps our bottom line when it comes to using the funds to actually make the game.\n\nWhite Guardian Studios is currently made up of just two developers. The other members of the team are contract workers. We strive to uphold quality, playability and fun in our games.\nWhitney White - Whitney is the writer, developer, coder, and the occasional pixel artist. Whitney has always had a love for games ever since she first picked up a controller and controlled the orange ball of !&*? that is Q-Bert. Whitney has been writing since the days of the dreaded noisy TYPEWRITER and has always wanted to write for games. Now she is finally getting her chance to tell a story to the masses. Whitney has 3 exuberant kids, ages 6, 3, and 1, and manages to balance work, kids, and love every single day. Whitney's favorite games are Tomb Raider (ALL OF THEM (except the black sheep Angel of Darkness... That doesn't count :P) ), Suikoden 2, Final Fantasy 8, and Pharaoh.\nTyrell White - Tyrell is the concept artist, pixel artist, co-writer, and co-developer. Drawing has always been a passion for Tyrell and comics were the cause. Tyrell is persistent and passionate about everything his name goes on. That includes his family, his work, hobbies, etc. Tyrell was always a fan of the Wild Arms series as well as the Legacy Of Kain series and has brought some of those influences into CT: DR. He also fills Whitney's plot holes and comes up with great ideas to make the game better.\nRicky Gunawan - Ricky is the character artist, sequential artist, and environmental artist. He is a talented, hardworking guy. Mainly working on book covers, we got really lucky when we found him and he actually wanted to do work for a game. His art comes in many styles as he is very versatile having done everything from children's books to anime to gritty comic art. He is very supportive of the team and has become a vital part of it. We hope to bring him on for many other games after this!\nZach Betts - Zach does all of the sound effect design for CT: DR. He is into game design and music, playing for an Australian band called Stone Chimp. He brings a unique style of sound to our game and strives to get it right. He has become a good friend and offers great advice and feedback on the game's development.\nMichael Correa - Michael is one of the composers and has always been supportive of our project. He better be :P He's Whitney's brother. Michael has taken a step back from working on the game's music, but still contributes melodies and originals for Mark to work with. Michael has always had a passion for music of all styles as well as video game music from the likes of composers such as Nobuo Uematsu (Surprise!). \nMark McKeich - Mark is one of the composers for CT: DR. He is also working on a couple of games, one being a horror game called Oneirophrenia. Mark has also been picked to join the staff of the official RPG Maker community for his outstanding composing abilities.  ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have shown great resilience and determination having had many previous kickstarter attempts. This is the same attitude we have towards making our game. We are going to keep working on it until it is complete and we are never going to give up on it.\n\nEvery project has it setbacks and delays but we've minimized that by knowing the engine that we are working with, and knowing who we work with and getting prices up front so there is no miscommunication. Our artist has been very supportive and been with us every step of the way. Reliable, friendly, and hardworking. That leaves us with coding. The backbone of the game is fully coded. The features of the game are mostly coded only leaving a couple of things left. Those things will go to freelancers who also know the program that we use inside and out. \n\nOther than that, that leaves us, myself and Tyrell. This game is our passion. Making games is what we want to do in life with this one being our first and our stepping stone on that path. There is no way we will give up on our dream.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #82", "update_userinfo": "Demon's Revenge Wallpaper", "update_content": "Hey everyone, and welcome back!

So my recommendation is to try to strike a balance between the style and the game and accessibility, since in the long term the playability makes a huge impact on the player's overall impression of the game.

Go here >> http://gx3.eventbrite.com/\nWant to donate? Go here >>  http://www.gaymerx.com/donate\n\nWanna be friends? Cool! <3 :D\n-------\nGaymerX is returning as GX3: Everyone Games! \nHooray! It's GX3: Everyone Games. \nAlthough we are still GaymerX, we've become more and more aware that not all of our attendees identify with the 'gaymer' label. While we love all our gay dude friends (and many of our organizers identify as gay males), we realize there are more people than that who want an awesome space to hang with their friends in a safe and diverse environment. We want to make sure we represent everyone who feels like they've been left out of mainstream gamer culture, and so the more common name for the convention will be \"GX\".\nThe location and exact dates will be decided after this campaign based on the funds raised, but it will be either in November or December 2015 in the Bay Area! (And near a major airport of course.) The convention will run from a Friday afternoon through that Sunday, and all tickets get you in on all three days.\nWe're still working on further details such as events schedule and a guest list, but we can definitely say we've confirmed guests Zach Weinersmith (Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal) AND Ellen McLain and John Patrick Lowrie (GLaDOS/Sniper voice actors and all-around sweethearts we call our Con Parents).\n  SPECIAL THANKS!!!!\nWe'd like to give a very special thanks to Devolver Digital, Dim Bulb Games, Bertil H\u00f6rberg, Coffee Stain Studios, Mike Bithell, Tinsley PR, Maxistentialism, Asher Vollmer, Trion Worlds, Louis Stavrides, The Fulbright Company, Wow, Such Business, and Love Conquers all Games for offering to sponsor OR pledging at least $3,000. (Won't you consider joining them, company looking at this page?)\nAdditionally, Blizzard Entertainment, Sympathy Plan, and MailChimp has committed over $10,000! (WOW!)\nEven further, Hornet has graciously donated free ad space on their app, so if you've ever been curious which dating app supports gaymers...\n^^^ These companies are amazing :) SUPPORT THEM!\n---\n!!! GET YOUR TICKETS BY DOING THIS !!!\nTo buy tickets now for GX3 (to be held in the Bay Area, California, in November/December 2015), add $60 to your pledge for every ticket you'd like to purchase. \nEach ticket is an all-access pass to all days of the convention. After 2014, tickets will be $70 plus Eventbrite fees, so getting your tickets now saves over ten bucks per person!!\nAlso, there won't be VIP or Donor Tickets, but there will be vip party, breakfast, lunch, and dinner tickets available on Eventbrite later on for purchase :)\nCANT MAKE IT BUT WANT TO DONATE A TICKET? you can still pay +$60 and we'll work with either Maven, Geeks Out and/or another accredited 501c3 that we've worked with in the past that supports queer geeks and make sure it gets in the right hands. You'll just need to choose \"no code, just donate it\" when you get your survey! \nJust add the amount of tickets you'd like to order, $60 for each code you'd like, and we'll send you codes for the tickets on Eventbrite once the campaign is over!\nroar voice: >>KEEP IN MIND THAT GX3 IS 18+, A QUEER FRIENDLY SPACE AND TICKETS AREN'T REFUNDABLE<<\n---\nCOSTS & BUDGETING\nWe're anticipating a total cost of $159,500 - we're asking for $80,000 (51%) as we're hoping/expecting that the final $79,500 can be made up through sponsorship and additional ticket sales if this Kickstarter succeeds. Keep in mind that until we hit at least $157,501 total, that no one on the team is budgeted any salary and we do this as a labor of love.\nOther costs not reflected on this graph include Boss of Honor booking fees/hotel rooms, stuff like legal costs if things happen between now and GX3 (and as history has shown, they sometimes will), storage unit costs, and other smaller convention costs that add up. \nREAL TALK\nOur first year, we didn't really know what we were doing and had to try to figure it out on the fly. Because of this, we hit a lot of unexpected roadblocks, expenses, and last minutes issues. With GaymerX2, we had a plan and knew what we wanted to do, but went with a venue that was extremely costly and overestimated attendance. \nBy doing this Kickstarter first before we sign any contracts, we can make sure we produce GX3 within our means on a sustainable level. We're also doing the event in the late part of the year, when it's off peak for the Bay Area and room rates are far lower.\nIN CLOSING\nWant to help? Please send a CV and thoughts and time restraints to gaymerX@midboss.com -  depending on your role, we may be able to help with expenses!\nThank for reading, and know that your generous contribution will help queer dialogues and otherwise overlooked discussions in gaming continue through 2015!\n---STRETCH GOALS---\n$90,000: GXTalks for GaymerX2\n$100,000: GXdev\n$125,000: GXdev - 2 Sessions!\n--\n$90,000 (CLEAR!!) \nFirst up, we have GXTalks, Season 2!\nLast year we took all the panels from GaymerX and put them up online and we want to do it again! We're really excited to be able to share all the panels from GaymerX2 to the entire world for free on YouTube.\nHere's an example of a cool panel from last year!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwpKf4zlwHA\n$100,000\nWe think it is SUPER important to create more games that talk about issues that don't normally get covered in games, so we want to throw our very first ever GAME JAM.\nIf we hit $100,000 - we will unleash GXdev, a weekend game jam (that people outside of the city can also participate in online) where we'll jam together, play each other's games, and show the world that we don't need to wait on AAA devs to make the games we want to see!\nTickets will be $25 or less!\n$125,000\nSession #2 of GXdev - two sessions in case someone can't make the first day. Of course everyone can come to both! :D\n--COOL REWARDS---\nFirst of all, everyone who puts in at least $10 will have their name on our thank-you page.

Thank you!\nWHAT IS HOTLINE MIAMI? \nHotline Miami is a high-octane action game overflowing with raw brutality, hard-boiled gun play and skull crushing close combat. Set in an alternative 1989 Miami, you will assume the role of a mysterious antihero on a murderous rampage against the shady underworld at the behest of voices on your answering machine. Soon you'll find yourself struggling to get a grip of what is going on and why you are prone to these acts of violence.\nWHO'S JACKET?\n\"Jacket\" as the protagonist of Hotline Miami and the playable character for most of the game. The name started out as a nickname by players, but as Dennaton referred to the protagonist as Jacket in various interviews the name was adopted as canon. Over the course of the game, Jacket dons various animal masks under new personalities and performs a number of brutal assassinations in response to cryptic messages left on his answering machine. After another masked assassin attempts to murder the protagonist in his own apartment, he spends his last chapters pursuing those he feels are responsible.\n*Prototype with Aubrey mask head and shotgun\n*Prototype with Richard mask head and katana\n*Prototype with Tony mask head and Bloody bat\n1/6 SCALE JACKET FIGURE DETAILS:\nThe primary figure is 12\" tall and comes with four removable heads: Tony (Tiger), Richard (Rooster), Aubrey (Pig), and a bloody, bandaged Jacket head. The figure also comes with interchangeable clothing including a letter jacket, t-shirt, pair of jeans, Air Vigilante sneakers and a hospital gown. Three weapons - a shotgun, baseball bat, and katana - are included for Jacket to hold as he is posed using the 15 points of articulation. \nJacket Hospital gown outfit concept\nWe've developed the Jacket 1/6 scale prototype which we're very excited about. We\u2019ll be updating any confirmed tweaks and design changes through our project updates for this Kickstarter campaign.\nThis project is a collaboration between ESC Toy, Dennaton Games, and Devolver Digital to create a collectible Hotline Miami figure without compromising their vision and this Kickstarter campaign allows the fans to help in the process. We've spent the last few months creating and revising the prototypes you see here to create something the fans can love, but we need your help to let us know this is something the community wants and to help fund the production on a larger scale which will help keep the price reasonable for all. \n\nWe turned to Kickstarter to gauge interest and build support from Hotline Miami fans. We\u2019re really excited about this figure design, and we hope you share our enthusiasm so that we can make this project a success.\nIn addition to including yourself to receive receive a 1/6 scale Hotline Miami Jacket figure, we've also set up some several rewards just for this Kickstarter.\nHOTLINE MIAMI ACCOMPLICE- $5\nACCOMPLICE: For helping us with this project, you'll also get a giftable Steam Key for HOTLINE MIAMI 1 at 50% off + HD Hotline Miami 2: Wrong Number wallpaper + exclusive Hotline Miami wallpaper designed by Erick Scarecrow so your desktop will be forever traumatized.

Help me out and get the game Greenlit!\nEven if you can't pledge, you can help by spreading the word!\nNew! Gameplay Mechanics overview:\nCombat Core is a 3D arena fighting game that borrows elements from games like Power Stone, Custom Robo, and Super Smash Bros. Hyper-powered multiplayer combat with custom fighters, weapon pickups, powerups, and environmental hazards! The game is currently in development for PC, Mac, and Ouya.\nMy most memorable gaming experiences are competitive couch-multiplayer games on the NES, SNES, N64, Playstation, and Dreamcast with my friends and family. I designed the mechanics of Combat Core to bring back the glory of fast paced, intuitive, fun, and competitive multiplayer.\nPlayers can battle from 1v1 up to 4-player battle royale or team modes. Players can choose from original characters, or create their own combatants with varying stats, attacks, skills, unique appearance, and a power core to grant special attacks and stats boosts.\nThe 4-button control scheme allows the game to be easy to pick-up and play, and the mechanics are tuned to reward both strategy and aggressive play by tying the energy meter to both offense and defense.\n Attacks are executed by tapping or long pressing (hold for .5 seconds and release) the attack buttons (default X and Y). Core attacks are executed by long pressing Y. Guard/shield is activated by holding B, and tap B to dive/evade. A is the jump button. Weapons can be picked up by tapping X when nearby.\nOnce the battle starts, players must attack each other until their health expires. Players each have 3 lives per battle, and when they have fallen 3 times they are eliminated from the fight. The last man/team standing wins!\nYour energy meter is indicated by the colored circle at your character's feet. This meter is used to execute core attacks and other special abilties, but is also depleted if used for guard/shield. The damage blocked will be subtracted from the player's energy, and if your energy reaches zero, your shield will break. Characters have passive energy regeneration based on their \u201crecover\u201d rating, but the large pool area in the center of the stage provides an accelerated energy regeneration rate. If the timer reaches zero, the death lazers will spawn and slowly force players to move to the center of the stage, or die instantly!\nI've been working on Combat Core full-time since Summer 2013. Most of the combat mechanics are implemented and working. The game is now at a playable alpha that is close to representative of the style/quality I am aiming for, but still needs a lot of content and polish to be a finished product.\nCombat Core has been completely self-funded so far. I've been supported by friends, family and my savings from previous jobs, but money is stretched thin. A successful Kickstarter will cover my cost of living for at least another 8-12 months, along with the cost of several other things:\nMore Content - I can continue to work full-time on the game and complete all the content I want to have in the initial/early access release of the game. This includes an original, unique roster of pre-made characters, a LARGE variety of custom character assets and movesets, a plethora of weapons, multiple arenas with unique hazards and properties, and fully functional online multiplayer.\nMarketing/Travel/Events- I want to spread awareness of Combat Core and regularly showcase the game at conventions and relevant venues like GDC and PAX. All of these events have travel costs, booth costs, and submission fees, and it would really help if I could cover the cost of people to help me during these events too!\nSoftware Licenses - I could recoup some of the costs of Unity Pro for Windows and Android, and any other software/assets I need to purchase to aid development.\nHardware - I could afford hardware/devices to use for deployment on more platforms like Mac, Linux, iOS, Kindle Fire, and PSVita (via Playstation Mobile) If I get approval to publish on major consoles (Wii U, Xbox One, PS4), this would also help with porting/dev kit costs.\nMusic and Sound - I wear many hats, but music production is not one of them! All the music in the current build is from free license music, or specifically given permission by the artist to use. With a budget, I could purchase music licenses for songs or have new, original tracks produced! I could also look into adding voice acting to the game!\nArt Collaboration/Commision - I'll be the first to admit my skills as a 2D/concept artist aren't world class. With a budget, I'll be able to partner with talented artists to help me with designing new characters and gear!\nCommunity - A successful Kickstarter means the game has a community and an audience that wants to play it!\nDOUBLE FUNDING WITH OUYA!\nWe are participating in OUYA's #FreeTheGames Fund, created by OUYA to support developers making new and creative console games. OUYA will match your pledge dollar-for-dollar up to the goal amount (and a max of $250,000), so help Combat Core get there and be a great game for everyone! To be eligible for this match, we commit that this game will be an OUYA exclusive for a period of time. To learn more about OUYA, go to www.OUYA.tv.\nWhy Ouya?\nI believe in the idea of the Ouya and having a platform for indie developers like myself to publish games to a console with no barriers. By partnering with Ouya for a limited console exclusivity deal, I can offset the costs needed from YOU to get the game funded, and the Free the Games Fund program does NOT affect the release of PC/Mac desktop versions!\nMABManZ is me, Micah Betts. I'm a team of one! I'm responsible for all aspects of Combat Core, outside of the music. Game design, programming, modeling, animation, particles, sounds, marketing, I do it all!\nI hold a bachelor's degree in Computer Animation and have worked as a computer technician, graphic designer, game development teacher, and as a professional game animator and 3D artist. I've been creating games on my own for over 15 years. Combat Core is the culmination of all my experience and passion for game creation.\nBy backing the game, you are literally helping make my dreams come true. I've already committed to finishing the game, but without your support I will have to decrease the scope, cut features, and the game can't be fully realized.

In the worst case, without your support I will have to cut down the scope to finish, or move to developing the game part-time. \n\nWith your funding and support I will be able to take the time to add content, polish and improve the game to the next level.

Back the sequel!\" Ty Taylor, The Bridge, Tumblestone\n\"Four Sided Fantasy will have an expanded scope and more work put into the visuals, which make beautiful use of color.\" Darren Nakamura, Destructoid\n\"Really want to play Four Sided Fantasy. It's the first indie in ages that might compete with [Jonathan Blow's] Braid.\" Megan Fox, Hot Tin Roof\n\"While The Fourth Wall was a proof of concept, Four Sided Fantasy aims to extend the premise significantly the way Portal stemmed from former Digipen offering Narbacular Drop\" Jeffrey Matulef, Eurogamer\n____________________________________________________________________\nFour Sided Fantasy is a game in which you have the ability to maneuver past obstacles using screen wrap. When you leave one side of the screen, you \"wrap around\" and come out on the other side.\nThe player has the ability to toggle screen wrap on and off at any time. The following images demonstrate this mechanic in action.\nThe game also gives players ways to enhance their abilities, as the images below illustrate.\nFour Sided Fantasy is a game about the limits of the screen.\nOn their journey, players will use their screen wrap power to explore the world of Four Sided Fantasy.\nPlayers take the role of a businessman insistent on breaking out of his seemingly endless office life. After being sent on a business trip to a small town, something seems off...\nThe player, along with the main character, will experience a wide range of emotions on their journey.\n                                       An example of the music that will lead you through the world.\nFour Sided Fantasy is in a pre-alpha phase, with plans to release on PC. We also have plans to release on other platforms if the opportunity arises.\nThe game is slated for a tentative release date in early 2015.\nExperience\nPreviously, I created The Fourth Wall, which went on to receive several awards. Four Sided Fantasy is a spiritual successor to The Fourth Wall that expands on the concept in many ways. The Fourth Wall serves as a nice prototype for Four Sided Fantasy, showing just a fraction of what this game will become.\n\u201c...it\u2019s utterly brilliant.\u201d John Walker, RockPaperShotgun\n\"I wish I could erase my memory so I could play it for the first time again. I can't wait to see where Logan takes this.\" Jamie Fristrom, Energy Hook, Spider-Man 2\nI was the lead level designer on Perspective, a game about a 2D character in a 3D world. While the game doesn't have the same mechanic as Four Sided Fantasy or The Fourth Wall, it is similar in design.\n\"One of the most innovative game ideas I've seen in quite some time.\" Cliff Bleszinski, Gears of War, Unreal\n\"...student game \"Perspective\"...might be the best thing to come out of DigiPen\" Terry Cavanagh, Super Hexagon, VVVVVV\nThe Team\nThe team behind Four Sided Fantasy consists of several DigiPen Alumni.\nLogan \"Lo-Fi\" Fieth - Team Lead, Design, Programming\n                                         Hi! I'm Logan. I recently quit my stable job as a level designer to put everything that I can into making Four Sided Fantasy. It wasn't an easy choice, but it quickly became apparent that this is what I should be doing.\nFortunately, several of the artists and musicians that I admire most from working with them at DigiPen are joining the team. The reason that we can keep our Kickstarter goal so modest is that they are working full time jobs to help make this possible. We can't wait to make this game everything that it deserves to be!\nAmalachi Zacharia - Art\nAmalachi is made of sunshine dust and unicorn farts, and is often called \"pixie fairy\" by people she doesn't know. She is an enthusiastic artist who enjoys working with highly motivated people to make cool stuff. She does a lot of things well, and many others not so well, but there are few art-related tasks she doesn't enjoy. She is a DigiPen graduate, and is currently working at a small company in the boondocks of North Carolina.\nJesse Phillips - Animation, Environment art\nJesse is spending his life on improving his interplanetary funksmanship.  \nIn addition to his long-term, extra-planetary goals Jesse is an artist with a passion for animation and illustration. Four-sided fantasy is his first opportunity to work on a game outside the walls of DigiPen. He also does a bunch of other stuff like playing guitar, martial arts and kicking butt with his wife and two dogs.\nJason Wang - Concept Art, Environment Art\nJason Wang is a recent graduate from the Bachelor of Fine Arts in Digital Art and Animation program from the Digipen Institute of Technology Singapore campus. Jason is an extremely efficient artist who specializes in 2D illustration. When he's not defeating you in DOTA or exploring different parts of Singapore, he's drawing up something crazy.\n   David Scamehorn - Graphic design, UI design\nDavid is working with anything that involves graphic design on Four Sided Fantasy. This includes the user interface, menus, and promotional materials. He even created parts of this Kickstarter page.\nA recent graduate of DigiPen, David was co-creator of the charmingly minimalist game Super Space ____. He has a background in graphic design, and a great eye for space and visual design. He also likes pizza.\nMJ Quigley - Music\nM.J. is the composer working on the soundtrack for Four Sided Fantasy.\nCurrently making all things audio full-time in Seattle, M.J. made the soundtrack to Perspective, served as co-composer for Nitronic Rush, and worked on numerous other student titles while at Digipen. He's been playing the alto saxophone since age 10, loves vintage synthesizers, and makes music with a strong focus on melody and harmony, or really just whatever focus the client wants.\nIan Shores - Sound design\nIan is a committed, passionate, decisive, and collaborative sound designer. He is the full-time Sound Lab Manager of a production sound lab (including management, hardware, software, recording studio, purchasing, and networking) -- while also pursuing a full-time BA in Music & Sound Design at the DigiPen Institute of Technology.  \nAs a Sound Designer, Ian specializes in adaptive and interactive game soundscapes, whose layers and nature shift character dynamically to reflect the player's choices and progress. Ian uses both studio and field recording, as well as scripting, filtering, and digital processing. He has a discerning ear, 20 years of classical piano training, 10 years of choral conducting & accompanying, and is a lover of great jazz.  \nHe is thrilled for the opportunity to work with the astounding game composer, MJ Quigley on this project.\nAlek Hiebert - Stretch goal guest song\nAlek is a fellow game designer and musician at DigiPen Institute of Technology. During the creation of The Fourth Wall, he was kind enough to provide a guest song for use in the end credits. Alek's love for Star Wars is only matched by his love for Dragonball Z. He consistently pluralizes game titles, thinking it is some kind of funny joke.\nReward Notes\nClick to enlarge\nPlease note that we have added some new reward tiers as of 4/28.

As a rule, a tier includes every tier tier below it in price but does not include the tiers that are limited quantity.\nNew! Have a physical postcard in the theme of the game mailed to you in an envelope. Hand-signed by Logan. You can now add a postcard as an extra reward to your current tier if you wish by adding $20 to your pledge (we'll see the amount, and a note from you on the survey that you'll get later on). To do this: \n1) Click \"Manage Your Pledge\" at the top of the Four Sided Fantasy Kickstarter page. \n2) Add $20 to your pledge by changing the pledge amount at the top. There is no need to change your tier. Remember, this is adding $20, not changing your pledge to $20. \n3) Click \"Continue to next step\" at the bottom of the page and finish the payment process.\nPlease note that this is the same for all backers - no matter what tier you are at, you will only receive a postcard if you raise your current pledge by $20. \nNew! We have added a tier for an in-game hat for the main character at the $12 level. Look stylish and solve puzzles at the same time!\nNew! We have added a tier that allows you to have an NPC in a secret area modeled after you, at the $70 level. The non-secret-area version of this tier was pretty popular, and this tier is limited to 25 backers, so get it while it's hot!\nNew! We have also added a tier for an in-game pet dog as one of the rewards, at the $90 level. They were all so cute that we couldn't decide on one, so it's up for backers to vote on which dog makes it into the game! \nTo vote on which dog you would like to see in the game, click here.\nNew! We have added a tier for an in-game hat for your pet dog. This tier is at the $125 level.

It could bring more innovation and diversity to the industry, and create meaningful relationships between people who play games and people who make them.\nI\u2019m Henry Smith (@hengineer on Twitter). I worked as a programmer in the game industry for 10 years, at BioWare and Irrational Games, on games like Dragon Age: Origins, Dead Space 2, and Mass Effect 3 before quitting my job in 2012 to start my own adventure. I specialize in UI (user interface) but I love playing with all aspects of game design. I also love board games and they\u2019ve been inspiring a lot of my ideas lately.\nI share my experiences as an indie developer on my blog.\nSpaceteam is my first project as an independent developer (\u201cindie\u201d). It\u2019s a cooperative party game for phones and tablets in which you shout technobabble at your friends until your spaceship explodes. You can get it right now, for free, on iOS and Android. It has won several awards, including:\nGameCity Prize 2013\nIndieCade 2013 (Interaction Award)\nA MAZE. Indie Games Award 2013 (The Most Amazing Indie Game)\nInternational Mobile Gaming Awards 2013 (Innovation Award)\nPCMag Editor\u2019s Choice Award and Android Game of the Year 2013\nMacworld Editor\u2019s Choice Award\nFinalist in the Independent Games Festival 2013\nSelection in the PAX East Indie Showcase 2013\nIt was recently exhibited in the Museum of the Moving Image in New York City. It has been used by children and grandparents, teachers, therapists, businesses, and medical schools. See the Spaceteam Retrospective for a look at Spaceteam\u2019s success over the past year.\nUnlike traditional campaigns, the Spaceteam Admiral\u2019s Club is not about one specific game. I want to continue making interesting, accessible games but I don\u2019t want to charge money for them. I want them to be free, for everyone. By joining the club, you\u2019re making it possible for me to keep working on free games for a whole year.\nSpaceteam will be getting some upgrades, namely:\nI\u2019m also working on two brand new games, Blabyrinth and Shipshape, which are still in the prototype stages but I can share some of the ideas with you now:\nBlabyrinth is a cooperative local multiplayer game for phones and tablets (like Spaceteam) about working together to follow clues and find secret treasure in a mysterious labyrinth. It will feel a bit like the board game Escape: The Curse of the Temple. I\u2019m also inspired by Spelunky, Escape the Room-style games, Indiana Jones and TV game shows from my childhood The Crystal Maze and Knightmare.\nShipshape is a single-player game for phones and tablets about exploring a quirky galaxy in a spaceship that you snap together from modular components. It\u2019s designed to be easy to play with simple gestures. It\u2019s inspired by the board game Galaxy Trucker and the video games Escape Velocity and Star Control 2.\nHere's where I'm expecting to spend my time over the year, but the Admiral's Club will give me the freedom to make smart decisions about my work, and pursue unexpected opportunities.\nSpaceteam Lexicogulator\nPut your own word lists in the game and share them with your friends! You\u2019ll have access to an editor that lets you change the words and phrases in the game. Business buzzwords, medical jargon, inside jokes, whatever you want!\nPhysical Membership Package\nIf you pick this tier you will actually get these physical objects in the mail: an embroidered NASA-style mission patch, a 3D lenticular membership card, and a printed certificate with the Admiral's Club gold seal (so you know it\u2019s authentic).\nDigital Membership Package\nThis package comes with digital versions of the rewards from the Physical package:\nDigital Patch\nDigital Membership Card\nDigital Certificate\nIt also includes:\nSpaceteam Instructions Fridge Magnet Set\nThe next best thing to actually being in space is manipulating Magnetic Astrocouplets on your refrigeration unit. You will become a physical embodiment of the technobabble generation algorithm. Isn\u2019t that something you\u2019ve always wanted?\nCustom Spaceteam Character\nDesign and upload your own character to use in the game! No longer will you be forced to annoy your teammates by repeatedly leaving the waiting room and reloading until you get a speckled felinoid wearing a lab coat.\nSpaceteam Control named in your honour\nThe Lexicogulator will let you customize the words in your own private games and share them with friends, but how would you like to name an official control to be used by Spaceteams across the planet? Over one million people have already downloaded Spaceteam. They could be activating the Chen Flushclamp or the Johnson Hyperspigot. Why aren\u2019t they??\nSpaceteam Medal named in your honour\nSpaceteams everywhere will be awarded a medal or trophy of your choosing. Will it be \u201cApril\u2019s Medal of Awesomeness\u201d, \u201cEmily\u2019s Commemorative Space-plaque\u201d, \u201cA Crystal Statue of Sara\u201d? Only you can tell\u2026 me. And I\u2019ll put it in the game.\nDiscussion Forums\nConnect with other Spaceteams across the galaxy. This will be the best way to keep up with Spaceteam and my other projects.

It's cute and approachable, but with amazing depth and an elegance of design - simple decisions with complex interactions makes it so replayable. Fun!\" \u2013Mark Terrano, Chief Creative Officer - Hidden Path Entertainment (Defense Grid, Age of Empires)\n\"Hero Generations is a game that stood out to us. It's unique, fun, and actually has something to say.\" \u2013Andrew Webster, Games Reporter - The Verge\nHi, I'm Scott Brodie, independent game designer, programmer, and founder at Heart Shaped Games. I'm excited to share with you my plans for the revival of my 2011 IndieCade Finalist strategy game Hero Generations.\nHero Generations is a quick-playing turn-based strategy game that takes inspiration from rogue-likes, 4X strategy, and independent art games. It has been described as the offspring of Sid Meier\u2019s Civilization, Jason Rohrer\u2019s Passage, and The Legend of Zelda. \nYou play a rapidly aging hero that explores a procedurally generated world in search of fame and a mate to settle down with before you die. After your life ends, you continue on adventuring as your child. Depending upon your choices, your child will be either more fit to take on the world, or hobbled by your poor decisions.\nLife took some surprising turns for me during Hero Generations' original development, and I was forced to put the game on the shelf in order to spend time with my then-newborn son and focus on other projects that could pay the bills. But with your backing, I can revive the game, finish the design and programming work, team up with amazing artist Dominic Sodano and musician Andrew Riley, and release it to the world as a standalone downloadable game for PC, Mac, and Linux platforms.\nHero Generations is best described as \u201cThe 5-Minute Civilization.\u201d An entire heroic life can be played through in minutes, but chaining together a 2000 year lineage comes from hours of deep strategic play. You move your hero around a procedurally generated grid-based world, and each step they take removes 1 year from their life. \nEvery turn confronts you with a meaningful choice about how you want to live your life. Do you stay safe and build up your hometown, or explore into the unknown in search of fame and fortune? Do you work to make the world better for your children, or do you selfishly pursue your own dreams? \nBelow is a narrated walkthrough showing off the status of our current gameplay prototype. Thank you to Journalist UnstableVoltage for creating the video. Note: all artwork is placeholder! \nHere are the game\u2019s current and planned main features:\nLimited Lifespan and Permadeath: each move your hero makes = 1 year of their life. Each hero has a limited lifespan (from 50-125 years) that puts pressure on you to think carefully about how you spend the years you have left.\nYour hero physically ages as you play\nGenerations, Mating, and Having Children: The world has towns that house mates for you to woo. Successfully finding a mate lets you have a child, and that child becomes the hero you control next in the same world. Choosing the right mate is key, as mates pass on traits (special abilities) that make your child more powerful and prepared.\n6 Strategic Paths and Meaningful Choices: Heroes are judged by how famous they become in a single lifespan. Heroes grow and gain fame by completing quests and pursuing the following strategic paths: \nStrength: growing in size and strength let\u2019s you battle the monsters in your path, and break down barriers to progress.\nLove: work to attract the mate of your dreams, and build an epic legacy of great heroes.\nExploration: discover what is hidden underneath the clouds, and blaze trails to make traversing the world faster in the future. \nWealth: collect gold so that you can create buildings in towns or buy items you can pass down to your children.\nFame: gain fame directly by questing to return ancient artifacts, slaying procedurally generated boss monsters, and competing with other families for the throne.\nBuilding & Technology: craft amazing towns by building Barracks, Observatories, Museums, and Monuments that offer you helpful resources lasting across generations.\nBuilding Tech Tree & Family Crafting: The 4 spaces next to towns allow you to construct special buildings that offer actions and useful resources. Buildings provide long term benefits and influence the culture of neighboring towns. Towns morph in response to combinations of buildings nearby, causing the mates in the town to take on unique traits! Examples of discoverable town types include the Ranch, Fortress, Ghost Town, Port City, and Dark Cathedral! \nPlanned Building Tech Tree and Stretch Goals\nExpansive Overworld: Each world of Hero Generations is a 10x10 procedurally generated grid filled with towns, forests, ancient ruins, monsters, and more. In addition, there is an expansive overworld: a 3x3 grid of connected worlds. Secret paths at the borders lead to completely different world types. If we meet our stretch goals, we\u2019ll add awesome new world sets that feature totally unique quests, enemies, terrain, and more! \nProphecies & World Events: Every 100 years, a major \u201cworld event\u201d occurs. Volcanoes erupt; giant creatures emerge hell bent on destroying the world. It can also mean the arrival of helpful special characters, like wandering caravans and fast traveling airships. You\u2019ll be challenged to grow and adapt to an ever-changing world around you.\nGorgeous Art Style: The finished game will feature the look and feel I always hoped for, developed by fellow Seattle artist Dominic Sodano. The visuals work to subtly reveal the emotional themes inherent in the game mechanics.\nSimple Yet Deep: The game system has many elements, but the moment-to-moment gameplay simply involves moving your hero from one grid space to the next like a rogue-like. The result is meaningful strategic choices like a 4X Strategy game, but without the heavy micromanagement and calculation.\nFemale hero aging along the strength and warrior path.\nMeaning: The game system was built from the ground up to be an exploration of the themes of death, legacy, family, love, and more. The experience of playing the game I hope will be a surprising and thought-provoking experience, as well as fun. I'll be posting more details on the inspiration and design philosophy behind this in future backer updates.\nIf we meet our basic funding goal, I will use the funds to convert the prototype into a downloadable, DRM-free version for PC, Mac, and Linux platforms. At a minimum the team and I will implement the following:\n1. All new art. We'll create final game art and animation with an all new, polished and fitting style like the mockups and concepts featured on this page.\n2. Support for both male and female heroes. The prototype supports male heroes and female mates. We'll fix this and add new female hero art.\n3. Overworld map. I'll add support for world tilesets, and procedural generation of the world and connected paths.\n4. New Worlds. I'll implement a 2nd world type: Desert. In combination with the Grassland and Ancient Forest types, the overworld will offer a lot to discover.\n5. Giant content addition: I'll add additional character traits, items, quests, enemies, and world events to give all worlds long term variety.\n6. Proper mid-term and end game content: Add the end boss demon and ancient prophecy system to provide goals and tension across many generations of heroes.\n7. New UI: I've learned a lot about what makes a good UI working on Highgrounds, and I'll apply that experience to create a new and streamlined user interface.\n8. Fill out building tech tree with more buildings and building behaviors.\n9. All new character rig and animations. We'll update our \"paper doll\" character system so that characters can be dynamically mated to create new heroes, and have more fluid animations.\n10. Polish: Fix bugs, improve performance, refactor hacky prototype code, better music and sfx, and generally do all the behind the scenes work necessary to get the game in shape to be deployed as a standalone game that can run across a variety of computers.\nConcept for the battle screen\nThe game is built to expand, and I've got big plans for how the game world can grow. If I am fortunate enough to receive funding beyond the basic goal, I\u2019ll pursue the following stretch goals:\nACHIEVED! We'll add the ability for you to track up to the past 50 generations of heroes in your family line, and display the chain in an awesome new \"timeline\" screen. It will show each hero, their fame score, and their parents before them! This screen will also show a local leaderboard of your most famous heroes.\n\nACHIEVED! Also known as the \"End Fortress\", this new world is the \"Mount Doom\" of Hero Generations. Only the wisest and bravest heroes dare travel here. We'll add a new art tileset along with:\nA new set of quests and quest objects: \"Defeat the Demon\", \"Rescue the Stolen Mate\", and more.\nMore challenge objects and monsters: Elementals & Chimeras! Lava, thunder storm clouds, demon fortress!\nSpecial traits only found in this area. \nUnique world generation rules: no towns, many volcanoes, many lava spaces.\nACHIEVED! We'll add 6 new building types to our tech tree, bringing the total to 18 possible structures. We'll also add a few new town morph types to craft! See the Tech Tree Diagram shown earlier on this page for details.\n\nACHIEVED! This new world is made up of 50% water tiles. The remaining land is clumped into 3-4 islands, and each island can have a unique biome. With the right traits, the right hero can brave these waters and discover rare treasures and mates. We'll add a new art tile set, along with:\n\nA new set of quests and quest objects: \"Defeat the Giant Squid\", \"Catch a Fish\", \"Find Buried Treasure\". \nMore challenge objects and monsters: Pirates, Giant Squids, and Sea Monsters! Boats & Trader Shops!\nSpecial traits only found in this area. \nUnique world generation rules: 50% water, 4 islands, dock nodes.\nACHIEVED! We'll introduce a new game system that allows for heroes to be adopted from a new building type, the orphanage. Adopted heroes are taken control of instead of the natural offspring of the parents. This offers a new strategic choice, and allows you to diverge from the path your current family lineage is leading you.\n\nA mucky new world where the dead take on new life. Dead heroes can become skeletons, and the ghosts of your ancestors haunt the land. Witches can craft items and potions from items brought from other worlds, and beware of plague-ridden bogs. We'll add a new art tile set, along with all new quests, challenge objects, enemies, and more!\n\nWe'll add 6 new building types to our tech tree, bringing the total to 24 possible structures. We'll also add a few new town morph types to craft! See the Tech Tree Diagram shown earlier on this page for details.\n\nThe world is a gauntlet of challenges, including quicksand, traps, and thunderstorms. But the world is filled with items and medicines of all kind, and many rare mates with special traits inhabit it. We'll add a new art tile set, along with all new quests, challenge objects, enemies, and more! \n\nWe'll add 6 new building types to our tech tree, bringing the total to 30 possible structures. We'll also add a few new town morph types to craft! See the Tech Tree Diagram shown earlier on this page for details.\n\nA harsh, frozen world where your every move takes an additional year off your life...unless you have the right equipment. Little life exists here, but rare ancient treasures, caverns, and knowledge about ancient technology can be found buried beneath the snow. \n\n\n???  more stretch goals TBA, and will be announced as we get closer to completing the rewards already announced!\nNote: during development we may decided to focus on different designs for the world types, but we will address the total amount of \"new world\" stretch goals we achieve. This is the current plan of the order we want to implement though!\n\nAll stretch goals will be added to the final game and made available to backers at all tiers $10 and above!\nHero Generations is very much inspired by my life experiences, so I'd like to share a little more about myself.\nI've worked in games professionally since 2002, and have worked as a designer, producer, programmer, and artist across projects of all sizes. For the last 3 years, I've been an independent designer/programmer at my own company Heart Shaped Games, working on an original web collectible card game called Highgrounds in partnership with my good friends at Spry Fox. In years prior, I was a Producer at Microsoft Game Studios, primarily focused on XBLA Games (Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet, Scrap Metal, Aegis Wing, Snoopy Flying Ace, to name a few). I've also worked at Stardock (Galactic Civilizations II) and Outrage Games (Alter Echo).\nHighgrounds, Aegis Wing & Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet\nIn 2010 I was inspired to make Hero Generations. It was an idea that stemmed from wrestling with many big life decisions all at once. My wife and I were recently married, looking for a place to settle down, thinking about when to have kids, questioning why we were 2000 miles from family, and both in good but creatively unfulfilling jobs. I wanted to make indie games full-time, but it felt risky, and it would delay a number of our personal plans.\nIn the end, we agreed the risk was worth it, and I left Microsoft Game Studios to start Heart Shaped Games and begin work on the prototype. That year, we were surprised with the news that our own next generation hero (my son) was on the way. With bad insurance, a small apartment, and a games business in startup mode, we were forced to make some hard decisions to accommodate our new arrival. Hero Generations had to be cancelled.\nThe next generation of Heart Shaped Games\nFlashing forward to today, my son is two years old, and my experience as a father has lead me back to thinking about reviving Hero Generations. My perspective has changed considerably, but that shift has also helped me fill in some important missing pieces of the design. It became clear that with Kickstarter, I didn't have to beg publishers for their support anymore. I could work directly with the people who love the game in the same way that I do, and release it in the form it was intended without compromise.\nWith your support, I'll be able to partner with a dream team of other Seattle Indie developers! \nDominic Sodano - Artist\nDominic Sodano is a 2D artist with over seven years experience in the gaming industry, having worked at Griptonite Games, Glu Mobile, and Zynga Seattle. He has worked on many titles over the years, starting from jobs that involved hiding objects into 2d backgrounds, animating characters, to fully concepting and designing characters. He has worked on many platforms including Nintendo DS, Kinect, PSP, IOS, Android, and Facebook.\nAndrew Riley - Musician\nAndrew Riley is the composer of over 50 titles, including the #1 selling iPhone game CraftedBattle and the Swedish Game Awards \"Game of the Year\" winner Secrets of Grindea. He also composed the music for my first game Highgrounds, and I'm excited to have the chance to team up with him again on an all new original soundtrack for Hero Generations.\nReward Notes\nAdd-On Reward s (new): You can now add an extra reward to your current tier if you so desire (no need to change your tier, just add the amount below to your pledge, and we'll see the amount and a note from you on the survey we'll send out closer to release).\nAdd $5 - Digital Art Book PDF. (Note: 1 Art Book copy is already included in the $30 tier and above)\nCopy of the Game: Receive a DRM-free version of the game for Windows, Mac, and Linux platforms when it releases (estimated release date is the end of 2014).\nPrivate Beta: Get exclusive early access to the beta version of the game when it is in a releasable state mid/late this year.\nAlpha/Prototype: Any reward tier that promises exclusive access to the Beta version of the game will ALSO receive access to the current alpha/prototype version of the game as well! Within just a month after the Kickstarter campaign ending, we\u2019ll send you a copy of the prototype for you to play and send feedback on. You\u2019ll get a taste for what the final game will be, and have a chance to influence the direction the game takes ahead of the Beta release.\nYour Name in the Game: At the $20 tier and above, exclusive for Kickstarter backers, you\u2019ll be able to get your name* added to the game\u2019s random name generator for all future players to see. Depending on the pledge level, you\u2019ll find your name appearing as the name of NPC Heroes, Mates, Monsters, or even the end boss! The higher you pledge, the higher the frequency you can expect to see your name popping up.\n*We'll vet your suggested name for appropriateness, and will contact you if we feel we need an alternative.\nOriginal Soundtrack (OST): Receive a digital download of the full original soundtrack composed by Andrew Riley of Lucky Lion Studios!\n$100: Design a Family Crest! We'll create a family crest image based upon a description and reference art you provide us. The crest will be added as an option that all players can pick, along with a color that represents them. When a hero mates, the crest is combined with the crest of the mate as well. In addition, you'll be famous, as we'll add your name in the credits under the special heading \"Family Crest Designer.\" \nWe'll add a crest in the game based upon reference you provide\n$150: Design an Item! We'll work with you to design the visuals and name for one of the epic rare items in the game! Available items include swords, shields, armor, bombs, hammers, mate gifts, and more. In addition, you'll be famous, as we'll add your name in the shop description and credits in the form of a \"Forged by <YOUR NAME>\" credits line.\n$250: Design a Character Trait! We'll work with you to design the visuals and name for one of the character traits in the game. You'll also help us choose from a big list of gameplay ideas to find a trait you think is important to be included. In addition, you'll be famous, as we'll add your name in the credits as the \"Kickstarter Designer\" for your trait. \n$400: \"Join the Family\" Design Chat With Developers! You'll get a 30 minute Skype chat with the design team where you can play the latest build, ask questions, offer feedback, and get a first hand look at what we're up to during development before anyone else. We'll also share our working design documents for you to follow along with!\n$800: Get Your Likeness In the Game and a Caricature! Dominic will draw you and a loved one as Hero Generations characters! We'll add the finished parts into the random character generator in game, and send you a cool high-resolution caricature to keep forever! We'll also list you in the credits as a \"Co-Producer\"!\nDouble Our Fun(ds)! We're participating in OUYA's #FreeTheGames Fund, created by OUYA to support developers making new and creative console games. OUYA will match your pledge dollar-for-dollar up to your goal amount (and a max of $250,000), so help Hero Generations get there and make a great game for everyone! To be eligible for this match, we commit that this game will be an OUYA exclusive for a period of time. To learn more about OUYA, go to www.OUYA.tv.\nTo be clear, the OUYA exclusivity does not interfere with the computer release! The PC, Mac, and Linux versions can release SIMULTANEOUSLY! \nI want to see Hero Generations in the hands of players instead of collecting dust on my hard drive unfinished. The game has been entirely self-funded up until this point. I've come a long way in getting the project to where it is currently, but I need help to do the work to finish and release it.\nSecond, I've talked with many publishers thanks to the exposure the game received as a finalist at IndieCade, but the game was always deemed \"too small\" to be worth investing in. Plus, a traditional funding partnership would require the team and I to make too many compromises to the design in the name of maximizing profit. I want to be able to deliver the complete and focused game without sacrificing the integrity of the design.\nMost importantly, I'm interested in bringing appreciators like you in on the process so that the game can speak to all of our shared experiences.\nYour generous support will be used to:\nPay myself the minimum cost to live while working throughout the year to finish the game.\nCompensate collaborators in art and audio.\nCover minor business costs such as maintaining Heart Shaped Games, software, fulfilling rewards, serving the final game, accounting, etc.\nPolish and Improve Hero Generations to be as enjoyable as possible.\nPlease consider backing the project and help make Hero Generations a reality!\nYou can follow me at @brodiegames on Twitter for updates (I'm pretty active here).\nYou can send me any questions or concerns at scott@heartshapedgames.com\nThe Hero Generations website can be found at www.herogenerations.com\nI'll be sure to post a number updates on the Heart Shaped Games Facebook page as well.\nOn a personal note, thank you to my loving wife, son, family, and friends in the indie game community for all of your support. Your feedback and encouragement has been invaluable. \nAnd of course, thank you for backing the project and spreading the word!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe prototype version of Hero Generations is battle tested to be fun for multiple hours already. I'm thankful to know that there is no chance I'll waste your contribution searching for what the core game is going to be. Assuming this campaign is funded, and all computers and files in source control aren't wiped out in a flash flood, there is little to no chance a version of the game won't be delivered to you.\n\nThat said, every project has risks and challenges:\n\nSMALL TEAM: Our plan is to keep the core game simple, single player, and based on existing technology we're familiar with. We feel confident that will help our small team keep our bug count low and deliver a polished and stable game. As well, combining our own small group of beta testers with our Kickstarter backers receiving early access to the beta will help us find the big issues before release. \n\nCustomer support and communicating with the community is something I pride myself on doing well with my other games, and our approach will be no different for Hero Generations.\n\nREWARD FULFILLMENT: It's important to play to our strengths, so for this campaign we've opted to keep physical rewards to a minimum. This will allow us to stay focused on making a great game, instead of getting on a first name basis with the fine people running our local post office! As well, my wife Kate will be helping to manage communication and the reward fulfillment effort post release.\n\nSCHEDULE: Every game is different, but as a former Producer at Microsoft, I've had a lot of experience tracking projects, keeping to milestones, and managing budgets. There are always unforeseen challenges in game development, but I've done my best to keep the budget and release time frame estimates realistic. At the end of the day, my goal is to deliver the best game possible, so any future delays (whether self imposed or due to the project being given more budget) would only happen in order to give you a better end result.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #41", "update_userinfo": "We Are The Caretakers Is Out Now!

Read about it from The Verge, Joystiq, Mashable, Gamasutra, Escapist ***\n*** C418 has been announced as the musician for our soundtrack stretch goal! More details available in this update ***\n*** Introducing Backer Powers! Gain unique powers only for backers. The power you get depends on your tier level, so check the Backer Powers section below for more info! ***\n\"...a genuinely refreshing idea with an unpredictable element of social experimentation\"\n        ~ PCGAMER (link)\n\"Choice Chamber is really something that needs to be seen to be fully appreciated...\"\n        ~ CLIQIST (link)\n\"There\u2019s big potential in this idea...\"\n        ~ ROCK,PAPER,SHOTGUN (link)\nChoice Chamber is a game that allows an audience of any size to play along with someone through an endless series of dangerous chambers. Players constantly give feedback that changes how the game evolves in real time, from power ups and enemies to obstacles and rule changes.\nChoice Chamber is designed to be played while being streamed live on Twitch. As you stream the game on your channel, anyone watching can participate in the game simply by typing in the chat box. A series of polls ask viewers to vote on certain aspects that alter the game's progression in real time, or viewers can trigger special events, friendly helpers, and even attack the boss themselves. Chatters can band together to help out the main player in getting far in the game, or they can work against the player and create a devilish challenge.\nThe game can also be played without using Twitch. \"Offline Mode\" keeps the game the same as before, except the choices are made by the game. In addition, you can also play privately with friends, as the chat functionality still works if you aren't broadcasting.\nart is work-in-progress, except for those sweet fireballs\nThe current prototype has lots of potential, and while many new ideas will be coming directly from backers like you, here is an overview of what to expect in the game once it's finished:\nAvailable on PC & Mac\nOffline Mode - Play on your own without the help of the chat room.\nAdditional Characters\nNew Weapons\nNew Gizmos & Special Events\nNew Enemies & Bosses\nNew Room Types - Rooms that challenge, surprise, change the tempo, etc.\nPermanent Collectibles - Things kept across play sessions\nMod Support - Custom music, player graphics, etc. There's a stretch goal to expand upon this (see below).\nMany More Polls - Including polls that scale based on the number of current players\nNew Chat Interactions - More than just a popular vote, but new ways to connect chatters with the player (check the next section!)\nmock-up: viewers help create a bridge via their speech bubbles\nmock-up: viewers fight a boss alongside the player by giving screen coordinates\nmock-up: viewers summon individual minions to help fight big bad things\nIn short: Everything. Right now, the prototype allows for voting upon the player's weapons, abilities, special maneuvers, all variations of powerups - both physical and elemental, enemy load outs, and terrain formations including claustrophobia and lava hazards. It's a good start, but there's tons more that will be added to the game.\nNot only will the chat be able to vote on more complex variations of existing possibilities, but new kinds of interactions will be created as well. Some of these include the ability to fight alongside the player through crowd-sourced attacks and a way to individualize each chatter to allow for multitasking challenges.\nChoice Chamber is currently just a prototype, an idea with potential to grow. This Kickstarter is the perfect solution to allow a full exploration of the possibilities that can come to life and create truly unique experiences.\nThe funding goal is set to an amount that will allow Studio Bean to really find out what makes a game like this unique, taking into account the time required to interact with backers and come up with lots of great content. There's also of course the standard 5% given to Kickstarter, 5% given to Amazon (for payments), and an additional 20% that gets taxed.\nDevelopment on the game will go into full force on June 1st. The majority of these funds will provide Michael (the main developer) with money for food, rent, etc. for the entirety of the project's development time.\nblending in with the huskies (art is work-in-progress)\n Backer Powers will be given to backers in every tier! These are abilities that you'll be able to enter into the chat once every round, and will only be available to those who back this Kickstarter! They certainly get juicier as you go up, so to find out which you'll get, see the table below.\nCredits\nYour name listed in the credits! This comes with every tier and will be a delight to read through. Trust us.\nThe Game\nA digital download of Choice Chamber upon completion. DRM-free. No Twitch account required.\nPrototype\nAfter the campaign is successfully funded and ended, you'll receive a download for the current prototype version of the game you might have seen floating around Twitch. (PC only)\nSoundtrack\nNot only does this include a download of the full arranged set of original music found in the game in both MP3 and FLAC formats, but it also includes a PDF of liner notes to shed some light on just what went into those grooves.\nBeta\nDuring development of the game, you'll be given in-progress beta versions of the game that are ripe with new untested features! Be one of the first to play the game as it grows and help shape it into its final form.\nArt Book\nThis art book PDF will contain the history of Choice Chamber's development - not only through sketches and illustrations, but with annotations and other scribblings in the gutter to give a whimsical look into how a game evolves over the course of its development.\nPower Pack\nGain the ability to use both the Player Boost and the Hellfire & Hoarfrost Backer Powers in the game (see Backer Powers section above). All other tiers only give you one Backer Power, effectively making you a huge help in times of need.\nPoll\nThe first of many design-your-own tier rewards, the Poll Design allows you to come up with something to ask the players in the chat, including their possible responses and how those decisions affect the game. It's super fun and we'll be sure to help out along the way.\nEnemy\nDesign an Enemy is a fun one, as you'll be fighting a lot of these things throughout the game, whatever they end up being. Again, we'll provide assistance to make sure everything stays cohesive to the game's image, but we strongly encourage creative juices to flow like wine.\nWeapon\nDesign a Weapon is really important, since it's the only way for you to protect yourself in those dangerous chambers. Do you go for a blunt melee weapon with a lot of punch? A long-range weapon that lets you stay at a safe distance? A fireball launcher with a bayonet? Let's surprise ourselves.\nBoss\nAh, the Design a Boss reward. There won't be too many of these hulking beasts in the game, which is all the more reason they need to stand out and be as unique as they are memorable. We'll work with you to come up with a truly menacing creature, something you'd be proud to put up on your fridge.\nSpecial Event\nSpecial Events are rarely used in a gameplay session, but when they are, oh what a difference they can make! These screen-filling enemy-evaporating maneuvers will be a treat to come up with.\nGizmo\nEveryone's favorite little helper, the Design a Gizmo / Gizmo Power will allow you to come up with a new kind of Gizmo to assist with battle in the chambers. Or maybe it's a healing Gizmo? Maybe it just lightly blows on enemies until they trip and fall in a pit? The possibilities have no end.\nIllustration\nThis high-resolution colorful digital painting can be of basically anything you want, drawn in the style of Choice Chamber's vibrant world. Let us know what excites you most and Bean will work his magic to capture it in a single image.\nDirector's Cut\nThis one's just insane. You get to design one of every Design-a-thing above, from Polls and Weapons to Enemies and Bosses. Mark your creative influence on the game with significant style.\nDay Jam Game\nThe ultimate reward of rewards, the Let's Make a Game Together in a Day Reward not only will see us buddying up to make whatever your heart desires within the confines of 24 hours, but this tier also includes the entirety of the Director's Cut above. Rest assured, we'll have some fond memories when this is all over. If you're near us in the world, let's do it in person!

Luckily, as Choice Chamber is procedural, any one of the polls, enemies, bosses, etc. can be cut from the project without compromising the ability to ship the game. We've had experience cutting content without sacrificing quality, on both independent and professional projects, and are well equipped to deal with feature creep. \n\nIn regards to the tiers that allow backers to help design various things, we'd make sure to preserve those if the time ever came to reduce content, and we'll be working with backers to ensure they fit the scope.\n\nWe're also mitigating the risk of developing across platforms through extensive conversations with other independent developers who have ported cross-platform.

A  glorious treasure has been promised, but all who\u2019ve sought to attain it have found only death. But you have a plan! You can gather the souls of great warriors past, who\u2019ve failed where you now seek success, to aid you on your epic quest. These heroes are strong, but not invincible--their spirit energy can only withstand so much punishment before returning back to the ethereal ooze.\nIf you like what you see, vote for us on Steam Greenlight as well:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=241019399\nSwitching Heroes\nIn The Hero Trap, you control up to three heroes at a time. One hero is active, or \"materialized,\" while the other two heroes are in their ghostly form. Each hero has a unique ability as well as their own individual items, stats and health. The challenges you face are many and you\u2019ll need to use the different heroes accordingly. Some heroes are equipped to dodge attacks, while others maintain crowd-control or deal major damage. Fortunately (or perhaps unfortunately), only the materialized hero takes damage, which you'll need to factor into your battle strategy. It's tactical decision-making in real time.\nUsing Items\nEach hero can hold one item, which goes into effect when that hero is in play (materialized). Items can be upgraded, changing their effect and sometimes allowing for their use across heroes.\nGold\nNo dungeon quest would be complete without gold! Gold is the universal currency of this world. It allows you to buy and upgrade items, acquire heroes and even bribe the guards of hidden passages. Luckily for you, enemies die in an explosive flurry of gold coins. So hack, smash and flame on, friends, we reward that kind of behavior here.\nRandomized Levels\nThe game features randomly generated maps, allowing for an ever changing gameplay experience. With 20+ levels of increasing difficulty and a new map on each floor, your dauntless mission will always be fresh and challenging.\nSuper Mode\nAfter decimating a multitude of hordes, your heroes\u2019 spirits are imbued with a burst of energy, triggering a \u201csuper mode\u201d. This bombastic state of epic destruction does not last long, so be sure to smite many foes!\nHeroes from across space and time have been drawn into its nebulous catacombs in the pursuit of their heart's desire. Every heart is different, some desire great wealth while others covet great power. There are a few romantics that believe the labyrinth holds the key to restore a lost love. History's greatest warriors have descended into the dungeon\u2019s depths, tearing through armies of monsters seeking their reward. One by one, they fell to the Darkness.\nAnd then, a couple of aeons down the line, a new kind of hero came along.\nAnd boy, are you... different.\nFor a mystical reason unbeknownst to all, you have been given something more crucial to success than all those who\u2019ve fallen before you. You, dear fellow, have been given the power to muster the Labyrinth's souls. Now you\u2019re not just a hero--you\u2019re every hero.\nKunoichi is a master of evasion trained in the mysterious art of Shinobi. Her devastating attacks are uncompromised and unchallenged within the order. She can dash with a button tap and slice with her katana while in mid-dash with another tap. Kunoichi\u2019s fierce fury is challenging to control, but with perfect timing she proves a versatile and formidable hero.\nEver wonder where Zangief got those scars?  Enter: Ursa. A powerful luchador with a (metaphorical) axe to grind, Ursa channels its rage into the whirlwind slash: a big area attack that can get you out of a jam if you\u2019re surrounded. Once Ursa gets going, though, it's hard to stop, so be careful of immovable objects--especially spiked walls.\nKnown only as Pyro and feared by all her enemies, this red-headed vigilante has the potential for massive damage output. Her pimped-out M9A1-7 can burn monsters to a crisp from a safe distance, and makes her the only character so far to strafe backwards and sideways while still attacking what is in front of her.\nNo one knows exactly where he came from, but a cold wind follows Mortimer wherever he goes. Though not terribly strong on his own, Mortimer is an incredible support hero. Trained in the dark art of necromancy, he can cast a chilling spell which damages enemies but can also raise the dead to do battle by his side.\nIn terms of raw power, Norseman has no competition. His bronze battle axe comes down on its targets with merciless force, hampered only in part by its wielder\u2019s hulking slowness. When used in tandem with faster, more agile heroes, he can be an incredibly effective ally with powerful and methodically precise attacks.\nThe Elf King is a master bowman and a seasoned hunter of big game. He prefers his flame bolts over boring old bullets, and a volley of these missiles from his trusty crossbow can make quick work out of most monsters from a safe distance.\nEveryone who backs our project will have the opportunity to help us create a hero designed by you, the Kickstarter community. If you are a backer you can submit a design for a hero or monster character, we will post it on a polling web page and other backers will be able to vote on their favorite designs. The winner\u2019s design will be incorporated into the game and their name will appear in the credits along with ours. Good luck everyone!\n Meet the Monsters:\nThe Slasher is not the smartest monster in the dungeon but he has two very important things going for him. His razor sharp claws, which he uses to eviscerate heroes, and the fact that he alway brings friends. When you see this guy coming around the corner, rest assured there's a mob behind him.\nAn immovable mound of rock that can block many types of dashes, The Mountain that Moves also has a devastating area knockback attack when he settles into a spot. \n\nWe will be revealing more monsters as the campaign progresses!\n Boss Reveals coming soon!\n REWARDS\nNew!

We've been working on it for about 8 months now and as you can see, we've come a very long way. Every project has its own unique set of challenges and this is no different.\n\nWe feel our design is the strongest part of the game and we've done everything we can to breathe new life and unexpected vision to the genre. We're not done, we're still tweaking but so far we've been getting pretty rave reviews everywhere we show it.\n\nKickstarter campaigns are tricky for video games, you need to show some great eye candy to get people\u2019s attention. Too often though we\u2019ve seen gameplay take a back seat to visuals and salesmanship. We didn\u2019t want to promise anything we couldn\u2019t deliver on so we\u2019ve been very careful about never showing in-game footage that wasn\u2019t real. It\u2019s unusual for us to have something look this good this early in a game, but we\u2019ve challenged ourselves every step of the way to come up with innovative gameplay in addition to stunning visuals.\n\nThat said, there are real risks here. Whether the Kickstarter succeeds or fails, we plan to release the game. However, an unfunded game would have consequences. Unfortunately, it would mean the project would have to take a back seat to work we do for paying clients and so will take much longer to complete. In addition, we would have to scale back the size and features of the game. \n\nCollectively our team has worked on everything from Game Boy Advance to web games to fully fleshed out PC games. But Playstation is a new platform for us, so there will be challenges ahead. Challenges we feel fully prepared to take on, but challenges nonetheless. Our plan is to make every version of the game great, regardless of the platform you are playing it on.\n\nThat\u2019s why your support is so important to us. We really want to make a game that is not only strategically deep but also vast and fun to explore with hidden suprises every step of the way.\n\nWe cannot possibly foresee every problem that may occur, but we can keep you in the loop about development, letting you know way in advance when things go awry as well as when things are going well. Of course you don\u2019t need to be a backer to talk to us, we\u2019re always available via twitter @smashworx and also on facebook.com/smashworx.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #33", "update_userinfo": "Final Hero Trap Build", "update_content": "Hi everyone,\nWe haven't posted in a while and we just wanted to let everyone know what we've been up to since the last post. We've ported the game to PS4, and it is running at a solid 60fps with no crashes. The game is also working on Windows again, with some improvements. It now has a solid 60 fps even on lower end machines, it also supports any controller, not just XBox 360. We're creating new graphics and are writing some new tools to streamline getting them into the game. We also have over 200 handcrafted maps that will be randomly picked when a player starts a game.  We're hoping to get a new mac & windows demo build out by November.

As many of you know a few months ago we went back and redesigned much of the core gameplay and AI. Specifically, we took out the switching mechanic, introduced jumping and we've also made it so that you play the boy or girl in the game. What were once the \"heroes\" will now be bosses in the game.  \nRecently we've introduced a new story. You play the boy (or girl) and you watch a demon steal your bicycle and ride it to the pit of hell. You jump into the pit right after him and the game becomes a quest to retrieve the stolen bicycle from the tormenting devil who mocks you at every turn. Given the new story we're toying around with changing the name of the game.

Monsters give up potion sometimes and sometimes you can find an extra bottle. When your health is low, you can hit L1 to drink a potion and heal yourself.\nNote: we did a playtest last night and it was definitely the most positive we've had. No one complained about the game being repetitive which is a huge plus. Also, no one complained that they didn't understand how the game worked.

Since launching on Destructoid.com in 2012, it has been providing a platform for the artists, designers, producers and other professionals behind many great games to talk openly about what drives them and offering viewers an opportunity to learn about video games on a deeper level.\nPast guests of Sup, Holmes? have included a host of well-known developers such as Jonathan Blow (Braid, The Witness), Edmund McMillen and Tommy Refenes of Team Meat (Super Meat Boy), and Jane Jensen (Gabriel Knight), writers like Anthony Burch (Borderlands 2) and Marcus Lindblom (Earthbound), and dozens of brilliant artists, musicians and others who contribute to the growing world of video games.\nAfter two years, Destructoid has decided to cease production of Sup, Holmes? with its 100th episode. But we don't think our work is done yet and we're turning to Kickstarter to fund production of a third \"season\" of the show with another 50 episodes. Season 3 of Sup, Holmes? will continue to provide the same in-depth conversations with game creators, available in video and audio formats, with improved production and a greater level of community involvement.\nSup, Holmes? is the kind of show that doesn't quite fit with the values of mainstream video game culture. It's a show about the realities of developing video games, about examining the creative process, and the interactions that happen between two face-to-face strangers as they get to know each other. It's not a comedy focused \"Let's Play\" or a live stream of competitive StarCraft. It's not a cartoon about foul-mouthed, teenaged Pok\u00e9mon. It's not a show likely to bring in the hundreds of thousands of views necessary to be an attractive prospect for advertising revenue. \nSo why keep doing it?\nSimply put, it's proven to make a difference in people's lives. Many guests in year two of Sup, Holmes? have expressed that the interviews helped inspire them to create their own games, or to value themselves enough to speak openly about their creative process. Others who told us they were not able to pay their bills with game development alone at the time of their appearance have have gone on to find greater success and more stable self-sustainability, in part due to finding a new audience through Sup, Holmes?. \nIt's a program we feel has worth. Funding this project will ensure the continued production of the show, something Jonathan has said he'd like to do for the rest of his life. And as he's already fat, bald, and tired-looking, he doesn't have to worry about losing marketability due to his looks fading over time. So, we have that going for us. \nWe also believe that Sup, Holmes? has potential to do much more, and we have some very cool stretch goals in mind to expand the project beyond just the podcast if we're successful. But let's cross that bridge when we come to it.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs the show has been successfully produced weekly for the last two years, we are confident that the third season of Sup, Holmes? should prove no more difficult to make.

We're devoted to examining the intersection of the culture we love and the lives we lead. Now, in 2014, we want to wow you with a weird, experimental, poignant, funny, iconoclastic digital magazine.\nTo get an idea of what that will look like, download Issue Zero \u2013 a small collection of reprints of some of our best stories.\nFuture issues will feature the best games and culture criticism from the all-star voices that have made Unwinnable great, like Stu Horvath (\"Death and Gaming\"), Gus Mastrapa (\"The Wasp War of 2014\"), Jenn Frank (\"I was a Teenage Sexist\"), Cara Ellison (Sacrilege), Matt Marrone (\"I Still Believe in Happy Endings\"), Brendan Keogh (\"The Problem with 'Innovation'\"), Richard Clark (\"In the Abstinence-Only Crowd\"), Chris Dahlen (\"Ocean's Away!\"), Brian Taylor (\"Mindways\"), Kris Ligman, Jill Scharr (\"Am I the Novelist?\"), Sam Machkovech (\"Fez and Phil Fish in the Round\"), Ian Gonzales (\"Return of the Jedi...Again\"), Steve Haske (\"Abuses of Power\"), Joe DeMartino (\"Not in the Face\"), L. Rhodes, J.P. Grant (\"Triggers\") and many more.\nIn addition to our regular contributors, we are recruiting special guest writers. There are also going to be jaw-dropping surprises during the campaign \u2013 watch this space to find out more!\nWhy $35,000?\nIn nearly four years, Unwinnable has brought together some of the best writers in the business. We\u2019ve tackled subjects like death, love, sex and RoboCop. We\u2019ve recorded dozens of podcasts and mixtapes; made some games; had a ton of fun and made hundreds of new friends along the way. All for free.\nImagine what we could do with a budget!\nUnwinnable has been a passion project from the start, run by volunteers and funded by day jobs, sporadic reader donations and the kindness of colleagues. We want to level up with Unwinnable Weekly. Each week, subscribers will get a fancy digital magazine containing five thought-provoking stories, for as little as 73 cents a week. That\u2019s less than 13 cents a story. Can you buy anything for 13 cents these days?\nPlayable logo re-imagined by Richard Hofmeier\nAnd these aren't just any stories. We don't do news or reviews like every other website. These are Unwinnable stories. We dig deep into our personal lives. We try to make sense of the world. These stories stick with you. They change the way you see things. They endure.\n$35,000 represents one year of bare bones production costs (plus shipping costs for the Kickstarter rewards, natch). This will ensure that all of our volunteers, from editors to writers to artists, get modest reimbursement for their thoughts and labors.\nEvery penny raised over our initial goal goes to making Unwinnable even better. To get a better idea of how we will use that money, check out our stretch goals below.\nYea, but what about the rewards?\nGlad you asked. We've conspired with our friends to put together an unparalleled slate of rewards for you, Dear Reader. \nNote: If you purchase a limited tier or bundle, you'll have the opportunity to buy other bundles in the back end. We don't want you to miss out!\nUpdate: We've also added a basic all-digital tier and an everything all-digital tier. We'll also be adjusting international shipping on a case-by-case basis.  \nUNWINNABLE STUFF\nSubscriptions \nYou will receive either a half-year (24 issues) or full-year (52 issues) subscription to Unwinnable Weekly, depending on the tier you pledge to. As of now, issues will be PDFs delivered via direct download, but we will eventually use all major digital distributions, like Apple Newsstand and Google Play Store. Along with the subscription, you will also receive a personalized thank you letter and a handmade origami crane from Kris Ligman (Critical Distance, Gamasutra) because you're awesome and deserve things like that.\nMembership Card \nBecome a card-carrying member of Team Unwinnable! These cards, personalized with your name and a membership number assigned in order your pledge, gets you access to the forthcoming forum and other member's only content we'll announce down the line. Having this in your wallet also entitles you to a hearty handshake from other members of Team Unwinnable. Feel free to make up your own secret handshakes.\nFive-Button Set \nIf the membership card is your ticket into the Unwinnable secret society, these exclusive buttons are your chance to proclaim your allegiance publicly on your lapel, pocket, bag or hat. Wear 'em proud.\nSticker \nThe perfect image to plaster over the mega-corporation logo on the top of your laptop.\nWALLPAPERS \nNeed art for your screens? We've got you covered.\nBackers at the SUBSCRIPTION tier will get a variety of Unwinnable wallpapers, including the Unwinnable Weekly Issue One constellation cover, a collection of posters from our Geek Flea events and original art from Stu Horvath, Amber Harris and Chris Martinez.\nBackers at higher levels will get the entire wallpaper collection, including original work from illustrators Mike Bukowski, Ben Caldwell and Janice Chu (working with characters from the Fullbright Company's Gone Home), as well as art from the games Hyper Light Drifter, Tengami, The Long Dark, Nuclear Throne, R\u00e9publique and Telltale Games' The Walking Dead, and additional work from game developers Buffalo Vision (Irrational Exuberance) and Cardboard Computer (Kentucky Route Zero).\nSample art, not representative of the final wallpapers\nBEHIND THE SCENES OF R\u00c9PUBLIQUE, BY CAMOUFLAJ \nPeople took notice of Camouflaj\u2019s debut indie game R\u00e9publique when the first episode hit iOS in December. Now, Unwinnable is getting an exclusive behind-the-scenes look into the world \u2013 and the real-world commentary \u2013 behind this ongoing 1984-esque surveillance thriller.\nEXCLUSIVE MINI-DOCUMENTARY BY THE CRITICAL PATH PROJECT\nThe gaming documentary series Critical Path: Conversations, by Artifact Studios, unites luminaries from all sides of the industry as they discuss the art, philosophy, politics and psychology of videogames. Origin Stories, created exclusively for the Unwinnable Weekly Kickstarter, reveals the surprising range of backgrounds and starting points that make up today's game development community.\nSECRET COLLECTIBLE IN THE LONG DARK  \nThe Long Dark, by Hinterland Games, takes place in an alternate future where a wave of energy has neutralized the world's technology. Just like this one, the world of The Long Dark has Unwinnable Weekly \u2013 and we have the clues to help you find it in the game.\nEXCLUSIVE PODCASTS\nThe guys at Josh and Jay's Excellent Videogame Show are cooking up something hilarious just for your ears, while our friends at Here Be Monsters are doing a special episode on death tones (spooky!). Unlistenable's producer Ken Lucas, meanwhile, is deep in the vaults, putting together a super cut of everyone's favorite segment, \"Do You Care?\"  \nUpdate: The Josh & Jay Show recorded a massive two-hour podcast at the Unwinnable GDC Salon. We had an incredible number of amazing guests and plenty of them ducked into the podcast to say \"Hi,\" including Johnnemann Nordhagend (Gone Home), Jason Oda (Perfect Strangers: Nothing's Going to Stop Me Now) and Lucas Pope (Papers, Please).\nTUNES! \nCustom Theme Song  \nGive longtime Unwinnable musical collaborator George Collazo (Dead Go West) a favorite genre and a brief description of your personality and in return you'll get a minute-long theme for you to play any time you enter a room. Let's not get too crazy with the descriptions, though \u2013 you don't want to end up with one minute of Tibetan throat singing. Or, maybe you do. That might be pretty cool.   \nMega Music Mix \nWe love music at Unwinnable, and we're lucky to have a lot of friends who make it. A lot of friends: Darren Korb's Control Group, Satellite High, George Collazo, Kalopsia, Corey Fogel, Citizen Blast Kane, Kursse, Coup Pigeons, Vaporware, Ambinate and our own Aileen Viray. On top of tracks from all those folks, we have unreleased songs from game studio BoxCat, and the soundtracks to the games Tengami, That Dragon Cancer, Starbloom and R\u00e9publique. And, as if that wasn't enough, Daedelus is whipping up an album's worth of geeky dance remixes.\nIf you select the MEGA MUSIC BUNDLE, we could have just given you MP3s of all those songs (and we will), but we thought it would be cooler if Unwinnable's podcast producer and resident DJ, Ken Lucas, spun down an actual mix in the tradition of our Unmixable mix tapes. So, you'll get that, too. \nAnd then we thought, \"Well, it's called a mix tape, why not make an actual cassette?\" So, you'll get one of those, too. We can't help you with a tape deck, though.\nFor a taste, check out Kurse's track, \"Automation is a Trap\" for free!\nGAMES!\nIndie Game Bundle\nLimited to 100, this all digital tier will give backers access to a collection of games you won't find in one spot anywhere else, courtesy of our friends at Arcene Games, Terrible Posture Games, Sean Hogan and Jonathan Kittaka, Sinister Design, Erik Asmussen, Two Tribes, Carat Games, The Men Who Wear Many Hats, Nyamyam and more. The list so far: Tengami, Starbloom, Tower of Guns, Bionic Dues, AI War, Tidalis, A Valley Without Wind 1 & 2, Shattered Heaven, Skyward Collapse, Anodyne (with the free Even the Ocean thrown in to boot), Telepath RPG: Servants of God, Robot Roller Derby: Disco Dodgeball, the entire Two Tribes catalog(Edge, Rush, Toki Tori, Toki Tori 2), Retro/Grade and Organ Trail.\nFor more information, check out Update 7.\nMini-Game Bundle\nDaphny Dream, by Cart Life's Richard Hofmeier, will delight you.\nSimilarly, Laboratory, the makers of Shift, Province and The Strongest, are cooking up an exclusive new game and you'll get to be there every step of the way.\nBackers at this tier will also get access to the development process of Pippin Barr\u2019s Jostle Dad, the sequel to his Playable game Jostle Bastard. When we released Jostle Bastard, it was accompanied by a huge amount of material (and existential dread) that Pippin generated during the year of development time. With Jostle Dad, you\u2019ll get to watch all that work and doubt unfold at regular intervals.\nFinally, Teddy Diefenbach (Shove Pro, Moonlighters, Hyper Light Drifter) will be subjecting himself to the ups and downs of developing an autobiographical game in the public eye. Good luck!\nEBOOKS & ZINES!  \nBackers who choose this reward will have plenty of summer reading. First up, we are working with Stolen Projects to create the definitive edition of Brendan Keogh\u2019s Killing is Harmless, updated and expanded just for this Kickstarter. Stu Horvath is collecting and expanding his This Horrific Life series of essays examining horror and the pulps, Owen R. Smith is offering his new short story collection The Cost and our friends at Christ and Pop Culture are compiling a collection of their best stories. We\u2019re also throwing in a digital version of Unwinnable: Year One, an archaeological anthology uncovering the origins of Unwinnable.\nWhile we\u2019re excited about all those, we can't wait to get our hands on Gus Mastrapa\u2019s Pretension +1 rewards. Gus is a pillar of wit and insight in culture criticism and his weekly column has been a must-read for years. Our first offering is Pretension +1 Volume One: The Joystick Division Years, collecting the entire original run of the column. Second, are two print zines. Heavy Metal X-COM, which tells of heavy metal bands and their battles against alien invaders in the world of the X-COM: Enemy Unknown universe, collects two stories from Bit Creature (\u201cTwo Possibilities\u201d and \u201cWar Pigs\u201d) as well as new material. Eat Fuck Kill collects \u201cThings I Ate in Skyrim\u201d (originally published on Kill Screen) and \u201cThe Skyrim Murders\u201d (originally published on G4), as well as new material. These will be printed in classic zine style (read: photocopied) and will be sent out later in the year.\nCOOKIES!  \nAt the end of the year, EIC Stu Horvath's mom Patricia spreads the holiday cheer by sending the Unwinnable staff care packages of homemade cookies, which are ravenously devoured by their recipients. This year, you can get in on the action for a special Christmas in July when this big box of assorted cookies \u2013 Stu highly recommends the shortbread \u2013 arrives at your house. We'd take a photo so you would have some idea of just what kind of cookies you'll get, but they never last long enough to get them into the studio. (Please don't select this reward if you have any food-related allergies. Domestic shipping only.) \nART!\nCustom Art Prints \nUnwinnable's in-house illustrators Amber Harris and Chris Martinez will be taking your direction to produce the artwork of your dreams. 11\"x14\" prints, ready to frame.  \nAlan Moore, by Amber Harris (left) and Thief, by Chris Martinez (right)\nHow about something horrific for your walls?

We don't want advertisers so much as we want patrons and friends. We want to help people and studios that make cool things show those things off to our readers in a way that is thoughtful and edifying instead of simply marketing. Because this is a more intimate relationship than advertising, a sort of mutual endorsement, please get in touch with us directly before pledging these tiers or if you have any questions!\nThe Friends of Unwinnable Sponsorship   \nA one-month sponsorship, also know as friendship \u2013 friends help and support each other, right? - your product or message will appear on the second page of four consecutive issues of Unwinnable Weekly. We will work with you to ensure that this space is unique and engaging while also keeping with the feel of the magazine. In addition to this, we will also include your sponsorship on Unwinnable.com. And because friendship isn\u2019t just a month-long endeavor, we will find other ways for you to engage with our readership over the course of the year.\nThe Legendary Sponsorship  \nIf the previous tier is friendship, this is like being family. You will take on the ceremonial title of Publisher. You will get a sponsorship page in every issue of Unwinnable Weekly for the first year, you will be the lone sponsor of our E3 party and co-sponsor to every other event we do through GDC 2015 (and more). But we won\u2019t marry just anyone (sorry, Activision), so definitely get in touch before you pony up for this tier.\nStrrrrrrrrrrrrrretch Goals\n$50,000 \u2013 We can now focus on building the Team Unwinnable community by fast-tracking the creation of forums and hiring a community manager. Despite ditching comments on the website last year, we do still want to talk to you!\n$75,000 \u2013 The Unwinnable Weekly staff now has the resources to populate a web store with exclusive merchandise from our friends and partners. We don\u2019t think art prints, mixtapes and eBooks like the ones we are offering in this Kickstarter should be limited to fundraisers. We want to be able to bring things like this to you from our partners year round. #boutiquelife\n$100,000 \u2013 At this level, we can expand the scope of Unwinnable Weekly. That means more stories, more guest writers and more artists each month, making every issue\u2019s exclusive content that can\u2019t be found anywhere else exponentially more thoughtful, engaging and beautiful. #moar\n$150,000 \u2013 LEVEL UP! At this crucial level, Unwinnable Weekly will add exciting features including thought-provoking daily content on our web presence, more podcast episodes and programs, and an expanded Playable, our indie arcade and behind-the-scenes living game lab.  \n$200,000 \u2013 Print isn\u2019t dead! We will produce print quarterlies of Unwinnable Weekly and greenlight Year Two and Year Three anthologies.\nAnd Beyond \u2013 Honestly, we have no idea what we will do if you fund more than that. This is a life changing amount of money. We aren\u2019t looking to get rich and buy an island or anything (though Unwinnable Island does sound pretty cool in a Bond villain sort of way), so you can be sure that every penny will go to making Unwinnable a more vibrant and exciting place for you, our readers. Because in the end, all this is about you.  \nMeet the Team\nA ship is only as good as its crew, and Unwinnable Weekly is no exception. We\u2019ve put together a crack team of veteran journalists and industry professionals to ensure every issue is released on time and chock full of the best culture writing on the internet.\n\nStu Horvath\nStu is the founder, editor-in-chief and general mastermind behind Unwinnable. He's had a long career delivering thoughtful commentary on culture to Wired, the New York Daily News, Paste, Medium and many other outlets. In addition to being a writer and editor, he's also a photographer, a connoisseur of heavy metal, a board game tyrant and, generally, a crabby bastard.\n\nSteve Haske\nUnwinnable Weekly's senior editor, Steve makes sure outgoing copy is crystal clear and helps keep things running shipshape. A seasoned journalist and culture critic, he also writes for Wired, Salon, Medium and a host of other outlets. Outside of editorial responsibilities, Steve is an aesthetics and film nerd and has been known to have an encyclopedic knowledge of videogame esoterica and useless pop-culture.\n\nOwen R. Smith\nOwen is the managing editor of Unwinnable Weekly, which means he\u2019s kind of like a utility player on a baseball team. Every successful enterprise needs a jack of all trades, and on Team Unwinnable, that\u2019s Owen. When he isn\u2019t putting out fires for the magazine, Owen writes about music and television for The Seattle Times and is a noted failed author, discerning bourbon drinker and master home cook. \n\nAileen Viray\nAs majordomo, Aileen mobilizes Team Unwinnable to rally, managing community efforts and advising on business direction for the new era. Coming from a background in Japanese and indie games, she\u2019s worked with Tecmo and Aksys before becoming an independent consultant. Aileen freelances in many different facets of the game industry, in business development, marketing, and makes trailers as a game capture artist. In her (little) free time, she immerses herself in electronic beat-making and cinematography.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nTo be perfectly honest, there are all sorts of challenges and risks associated with starting a digital magazine that\u2019s supposed to come out every single week! While we\u2019re all industry veterans, we are taking on new roles and responsibilities to get this publication off the ground. Before any of us committed to making Unwinnable Weekly a reality, we looked at what the biggest roadblocks might be and how we could work around them. This is what we found. \n\nWE NEED A BUDGET: For the better part of four years, Unwinnable.com put out daily content without paying a single member of its staff a cent. While our legion of contributors made their livings working for publications such as Wired, Salon, Polygon and Ars Technica, they always made time for Unwinnable. We want to reward that loyalty, because we know it\u2019s increasingly hard to ask our team of writers, artists, producers and directors to donate their time. Even a modest budget would allow us to retain these talented voices and give them an exciting new space in which to speak. \n\nLOGISTICS: If all of us were independently wealthy, getting a digital magazine from drawing board concept to your iPad once a week would still be a heck of a challenge. To be successful, every detail has to be sorted, from when stories are due to editors to how the magazine will get into the hands of our readers. Fortunately we\u2019ve stacked the deck in our favor, with a team of editors that have experience at daily newspapers and magazines working under crushing deadlines. For them, working on a weekly publication will be a nice change of pace. While we can\u2019t reveal every little inner working, you can head over to our FAQ for more information on the Rube Goldberg machine that is Unwinnable Weekly. \n\nCHANGE IS HARD: One of the risks we know we have to overcome is that for the first time, Unwinnable will start charging its readers. For access to a unique magazine each week, we are asking for $3.50 a month, or $35 a year. \nIt\u2019s easy to say, \u201cWell, what are you guys worried about? Unwinnable been around for years and besides, you can get an indie game on Steam for cheaper than that!\u2019\u201d You\u2019d be right, but we are changing the paradigm and we don\u2019t expect everyone to be happy at first. What we hope becomes evident for those who do choose to subscribe is the quality we\u2019re able to deliver. \n\nMost writers who cover videogames and the rest of Unwinnable's geeky cultural cross-section are freelancers, meaning that if we\u2019re able to pay them even a little bit of money they can justify the time they\u2019re investing. Just as important is the unique approach they bring \u2013 no matter what your interest is, from obscure metal, board games or pulp dime novels to comics, art and (of course) videogames, Unwinnable's contributors offer sharp, insightful cultural commentary and criticism you just can't find anywhere else. We believe they\u2019re worth the risk. \n\nEvery single project on Kickstarter has some kind of risk attached to it. Unwinnable Weekly is no different. What makes us special is our experience and our deep roster of talented writers. More than a company, we\u2019re a collaborative community that has made Unwinnable a priority in our professional and personal lives, and we look forward to sharing our passion with you.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #27", "update_userinfo": "Final Update!", "update_content": "Hi gang!\nWe have finally reached the end!
