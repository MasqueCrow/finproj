We're Nova and Mali, and we like making collaborative gay art projects. Our goal is to create an art book full of famous works of art you probably recognize, but we're making them gay, trans, and POC inclusive!\nYou want to see the Birth of Venus but trans? We got you.\nLeyendecker but lesbians? We've got that too.\nSuccessfully funded in only two hours, and stretch goals all reached in five hours!\nKickstarter marked us a project they love and we've been featured in the Mary Sue and Fangirlish!\nMock-up of the front and back cover of the book\nOur hard cover art book will be in full color, filled to the brim with beautiful reimagined works of art from Ancient Greece to 20th century Rockwell. \nA mock-up of the book's interior, featuring Aadorah's finished piece and Blackdistraction's WIP\nThe cover has been beautifully painted by Shouty (Shouty_y), reimagining Fragonard's The Swing as a new stunning piece! We've gathered over 60 artists from around the world and each is creating a new piece of art for us.\nOur wonderful artists!\nOur campaign graphic design was created by our very own Floh (FlohGna) who is also illustrating a piece for the book. Thank you Floh!\nThis is our second project - we successfully ran Lady Tarot Cards last year (2020), reaching all of our stretch goals and more with nearly $40,000 raised. Quite a few artists from the cards have come over to work on this book too and we're thrilled to have them back.\n(Small note: we are out of the tarot cards - we ended up selling them all! We are not planning a reprint at this time as it would take over 500 orders to consider it which is basically an additional KS campaign!)\nSome of our tarot cards!\nOur tarot cards with their foiled sides and their tuck box\nOur Book\nMock-up showing the book's cover\nOur book will be 8.5x11 inches and have a soft matte touch hardcover and filled with over 60 different works of art from over 60 artists! This is an ongoing project with art still being created - some designs may change but the overall feel will of course be the same.\nAll orders of the book will now include 1 holographic print from cleocatart - their piece is based on Leighton's The Fisherman and the Syren.\nMock-up of the interior, showing Vicky's WIP and Pien's finished piece\nThe Merch\nOur merch pack and the shiny bits!\nEach merch pack will have:\n 1 sticker designed by karlovycross (design coming soon based on Le Flirt a La Rose by LeClerc) (this might end up being a glitter or holographic sticker too!!!!)\n 1 metal bookmark designed by mayticks featuring Hades and Persephone, Theseus and a Fury, and Orpheus and Eurydice!\n 3 holographic art print 6x9 inches of fidisart's piece based on Mucha's Flirt and two more yet to be determined!\n 3 random postcards from a selection of art from the book\n Your choice of 1 of 3 acrylic charms designed by rosefinchie and renstrapp! Rose  designed two charms: one with cave hand paintings and one with Artemisia Gentileschi. The cave painting design is being workshopped into possibly being glow in the dark, and Artemisia is a clear charm! Ren created a design with Venus de Milo and Nike of Samothrace as girlfriends.\n An embroidered patch designed by Mayticks! Her patch features Hades and Persephone...and some innocuous pomegranates.\nSome designs are still TBD as our artists complete their work!\nClose up view of our shiny shiny bookmark from Mayticks!\nSupport Levels/Pledge Tiers\nEarly bird pledge description and graphics\n The first 20 people to pledge for the book and book/merch levels get a discounted price!\nThese early bird tiers are:\nArt book - digital and physical - $35 (plus shipping)\nArt book (digital and physical) and merch - $60 (plus shipping)\nPledge levels and graphics!\n Our normal support level tiers are:\nDigital book only - $15\nMerch only - $30 (plus shipping)\nArt book (digital and physical) - $40 (plus shipping)\nArt book (digital and physical) and merch - $70 (plus shipping)\n2 x Art books and merch - $130 (plus shipping)\nA reminder: if we unlock levels below in the stretch goals, those items will be automatically included in your pledges!\nOur limited edition tier\nFinally, we have one limited edition tier! This tier includes the books and merch PLUS a limited edition linograph print from Mayticks of her version of Klimt's The Kiss (A3 size - 29.7 x 42 cm, 11.75 x 16.5 in). We have 25 prints available!\nArt book (digital and physical), Merch, and 1 print - $150 (plus shipping)\nMayticks' lino prints!\nWe will be using BackerKit for this project and you'll get emails from them later on about shipping addresses. You'll also get a chance to add-on any additional items and a few leftover merch choices from Lady Tarot Cards. Finally, you'll be able to pre-order more copies and merch through there before we launch our online store - when the store launches, the prices will no longer have the discounted KS prices you find here!\nReminder: Kickstarter doesn't charge you unless/until we get funded - that means your card won't be charged until May! You can adjust your pledge or cancel it until May 5. We of course hope you won't cancel a pledge, but understand that things are very tough right now.\nThis book will not be reprinted - this is a one run deal and we'll order enough to cover the KS orders, our pre-orders in the store, and enough to stock the store for a while. After we run out, that'll be it!\nOur Stretch Goals\nGraphic showing our unlocked stretch goals!\nALL STRETCH GOALS UNLOCKED ON DAY ONE!!!\nAt $35,000, all the books will have a soft touch matte hardcover!\nAt $40,000, all merch packs will include your choice of 3 acrylic charms, designed by rosefinchie and renstrapp!\nRenstrapp is creating a keychain design with Venus de Milo and Nike of Samothrace as girlfriends, and rosefinchie designed two charms: one with cave hand paintings and one with Artemisia Gentileschi. The cave painting design is being workshopped into possibly being glow in the dark!\nAt $45,000, all merch packs will include an embroidered patch designed by Mayticks! Her patch features Hades and Persephone...and some innocuous pomegranates.\nAt $50,000, all merch packs will include 3 holographic prints (1 from fidisarts and 2 others), and all physical orders will include 1 holographic print from cleocatart - their piece is based on Leighton's The Fisherman and the Syren.\nNEW STRETCH GOAL!\nThis campaign has surpassed all of our hopes and is firmly in the WOW category! We're announcing a new stretch goal for $150k - a solid 3D metal keychain featuring Mayticks' Hades and Persephone design!! This would be included with every merch pack, and available for purchase as an add-on after the campaign in the Backerkit survey. Let's get to work sharing this around so we can get these bad bois unlocked!\nMayticks' design for the keychain\nMayticks' keychain!\nThe Timeline and Funding\nOur timeline is of course dependent on a lot of things, including but not limited to: artists finishing their work, products being made in a timely manner, shipping to us with minimal delays, packing and shipping everything (it's just the two of us so it might take a few extra days!), and then shipping out to you!\nIdeally, our timeline is as follows:\nApril - May - Kickstarter campaign runs and the funds get sent to us in May\nMay - June - Artists complete their pieces\nJuly - August - We compile everything and get things sent to production. Some of the merch is already ready to go - the biggest work will be for us to format the book for print to ensure the highest quality images.\nSeptember - November - A nice big window for us to receive and send out the goodies, ideally BEFORE the holiday postal rush.\nWe will be keeping everyone up to date with updates as we go through the process, especially when we receive products in the mail! This is going to have some really amazing things created and we can't wait to be able to show you.\nOur funding process covers the products, shipping, and all the taxes/fees, and everything else is used to pay our artists and mods!\nWe've been through this rodeo before so we know some backers forget or miss the backer survey when we ask for your address. It is your responsibility to make sure your email is correct so we can send you important updates and messages! We will hold your pledge goodies for six months after we send out the last call message, and we will try our absolute best to get in contact with you - we don't want anyone to miss out. After that six months, we will no longer hold your goodies and cannot offer a refund - we have a very small apartment and we need the space!\nShipping\nWe will ship anywhere in the world in sturdy cardboard mailers. We are not responsible for lost or damaged packages, and many will take a long time to get to you especially for our international friends. We are also experiencing a much higher volume of orders than we expected so even with the help of a few friends, our packing/sending process will take a little longer - please be patient with us :)\nWe CAN ship to the UK, even with the new VAT rules, thanks to the project being a book! Shipping is expensive right now with many countries/postal carriers adding extra surcharges to their rates - please be aware of that when you click through to the shipping options. Most packages are $15/30 for domestic (USA) and international packages.\nWe are not responsible for any additional customs/duties on packages. We will be declaring them as printed matter/books/postcards/bookmarks/etc as appropriate and we of course hope there won't be any issues - the labels will not include any indication of LGBT content.\nOur digital book can be emailed easily to anywhere anytime! (after, of course, it's made and ready to send out this fall!)\nAbout us!\nNova and Mali have been married for a few years now and spend most of their free time working with their endless cycle of rescue foster kittens! They ran a successful project during 2020 to create nearly 800 decks of tarot cards and sent them all over the world.\nPhoto of Mali and Nova from their wedding photos", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOur biggest risk, assuming we get funded, is timing. Our timeline is a best guess - things can go awry with quality control and shipping to us, causing delays. We will communicate these issues as best we can as they happen, and keep everyone informed.\nLately the shipping scene is a mess.

If you couldn't make it in time, wishlist Breakwaters on Steam and join us on Discord.\nIf you have questions about the rewards, please message us on Kickstarter or reach out to use on Discord or Twitter.\nIn the ocean depths lies the key to defeating Titans and bringing calm to the waves. Sail the waters to find new islands & resources to build, craft, and survive.  Explore the world and uncover ancient secrets about the truth of the Titans if you wish to save the people on the land.\n\nBreakwaters is a unique exploration survival game that is on track to ship single player and co-op gameplay later this year, but we need your help.  Partner with us to take Breakwaters forward so it can release in its best possible way and add your personal touch to the world.\n\nKey Features\nOnline co-op and Single player\nMassive ocean sim that creates a unique interactive open world experience\nDefeat Titans as large as an island and fight Golems as big as a house.\nGather crystals and refine them into items which displace and deform the ocean revealing rich resources below.\nBuild  structures that interact with the world scale ocean simulation.  Turn a valley into a lake or open the doors and flood the lowlands.\nCraft items to suit your play style whether it be farmer, explorer, adventurer.\nBuild and customize your boat to handle Titans, rough weather, and local enemies.\nMassive world filled with procedural islands and unique biomes.\nDynamic time of day and weather.\nBreakwaters has a powerful ocean sim at its core.  It interacts with everything in the world and you can interact directly with it.  Build walls to hold it back or use refined crystals to displace it and venture into its depths.\nRefined Yellow Crystal repels water revealing resources below\nRefined Blue Crystal creates water\nUse ancient lighthouses to reveal submerged structures full of monsters and treasure. \nDiscover ancient ruins hidden below the water\nTitans are ancient relics of a past civilization.  They roam the ocean, destroying anything that gets too close or draws their attention for too long.\nTurtle Titan - A large biped Titan which displaces water anywhere it walks.  Its armor prevents any attack of opportunity.\nSerpent Titan - Swimming in the ocean depths, they cause whirlpools and typhoons.  Defeating a Serpent Titan requires either a fast or a strong boat.\nCrab Titan - There is little recorded evidence of Crab Titans.  What has been recorded indicates they walk up from the oceans depths directly onto an island and attack anything unwise enough to stand in their way.\nTitans are relics of an ancient civilization\nThe destructive force of a Titan can scare even the most prepared, but the rewards gained from defeating one are said to be greater than anything found on any island.\nTitans have multiple unique destructive attacks\nThe world is full of different biomes and unique resources.  Build a boat, add contraptions to fit your play style, and set off for adventure.\nExplore the world to find new biomes, islands, and people with unique missions.\n Traveling by raft, boat, glider, or on foot are all useful depending on the situation.\n Although the world is ravaged by Titans, there are also massive creatures which are more friendly and willing to let you say hello.\n \"Its dangerous to go alone\"... bring a friend!\nOnline co-op is important to us in addition to a compelling single player experience.\nBuild a home base together\nExplore the world with friends in online co-op\nRefined Crystals\nThe ocean water in Breakwaters contains unique minerals which form into powerful crystals.  Each type interacts with water in a different way, and can be used to power Items and Contraptions for unique results. \nHarvest plants from land and sea. Find rare seeds to grow in your farm.  Some plants are like rice and will require flooded fields while other plants require dryer soil.\nBuild, earn, or buy new items to improve your ability to build, attack, defend, and farm.\nSome weapons can be improved by inserting crystals into slots as upgrades.\nWeapon upgrades \nItems can be upgraded on a work bench by placing a Skill gem in a weapons socket. Each Skill gem integrated into a weapon will increase its capability.  Skill gems are harvested from the world and are considered valuable trade items among the locals.\n\nThe world of Breakwaters is populated by many creatures, each with their own way of surviving.  In addition to each type of creature and monster in the world there are different skill levels and difficulties.\nContraptions provide powerful ways to interact with the world.  Improve your home, make survival easier, or set up automated defenses.\nCrystals and contraptions go hand in hand to make unique items and new interactions with the ocean.\nCannons: great for combat and chopping trees down!\nMove water around and power contraptions with pumps and pipes\nGrab sunken treasure from the ocean floor\nScoop items into a wagon for quick transport\nCooking!\nBiomes and islands are procedural spawned in a unique way for every player.  They are populated with plants, animals, and unique points of interest to explore.  Everything in the world can be destroyed or harvested except ancient stone, the same material Titans are mostly carved from.\nEach biome has unique plants, animals, and monsters\nFor the initial early access launch, our goal is to ship the Tropical, Rocky, Pine, and Swamp biomes.  A variety of plants and animals are planned for each biome along with unique point of interest interactions.  Some of these interactions are small local experiences, others create large changes which affect the water and islands across the world.\nProcedural Islands with infinite variety\n Weather is a dynamic element in the world impacted by many factors.\nThe time of day\nProximity of a Titan\nThe current state of nearby ancient structures\nUnique powerful items\nLightning can start fires. Fires can be put out with Refined Blue Crystal.\nThe result of weather on the world can range from mild to dangerous.  Large waves can make it difficult to sail.  Thick fog can obscure a nearby island.  Lightning can damage you or catch trees on fire.  Rain washes down hills, collects in valleys, and adds to the ocean sim.\n\nUnique day/night sensitive plants and animals create different resources based on what time of day they are harvested.\nDynamic day and night cycle\nDuring the day you can harvest regular coral, but at night you can harvest bio-luminescent coral.  Unique plants and animals only exist at specific times of day, like fireflies at night.\nBiolumenesent plants and animals\nUncover an ancient mystery long hidden deep within the ocean and become a Breakwater, a protector of the people.  Voyage across the seas and defeat ancient Titans that have ravaged the oceans for centuries.  Displace the ocean and delve into their depths to find rare resources.\n\nTitans, ancient relics of a past civilization, have disturbed the oceans and destroyed the land for as long as anyone can remember.  The only thing we know is they are connected somehow to the power crystals which form from the ocean waters.\nDiscover the world's secrets, delve into the ocean depths, and become the hero long needed; become a Breakwater.\n\n Michael Bross (composer/audio director/sound designer) \nMichael is composing all of the music for Breakwaters.  He has composed for Ratchet & Clank, Oddworld, Honor of Kings, Counter-Strike GO, and many other games.  Above is the Title song he recently finished for the game.  We are extremely excited to have him on board and cant wait to share more of his work with you.\nWe are currently in the middle of Production for Breakwaters and are expecting to ship into PC Early Access in late Q2 or early Q3 2021.  We are planning for a Beta around mid April followed by an Online co-op beta when those features are ready to test in larger groups.\n\nProduction will continue after PC Early Access launch to add additional world, enemies, missions, new community requested features, items, and bug fixes.  We estimate a console early access build around September (TBD based on console approval speed).  Full product release to all platforms is expected to happen in late fall 2021.\nPlanned localization\nWe are a small indie studio started in 2019.  Our team is made up of 4 people who have been passionately working on Breakwaters together for the past 6 months.  Before that, Breakwaters was a solo project started in the summer of 2019.

Limited resources, however, restrict how much we can pay them, but as we are able to raise money beyond covering our basic costs, we can ensure they are paid well for their work! Each stretch goal of $800 will go towards giving our artists a 25% pay raise! We'll have four stretch goals that, if met, will double our artists' pay!

Hidden in nebulas and surrounded by reefs off the Arabian coast lies the ancient island of Dioscoria. Founded by priestesses and sages cast out by the hierophants of their homelands, it is a safe haven for mystics, misfits, rebels, and outcasts from neighbouring and distant shores.\nSheltered from the wrath of the orthodoxies, this Discorian society favours empathy, playfulness, and prowess of the mind. To celebrate these traits, Dioscorians cherish one pastime as old as the island itself\u2014Sefirot, a game of divination.\n\n\nThe game of Sefirot combines the worlds of Tarot divination and board gaming into an activity that is both meditative and playful. It is played in numerous variations on different playing fields, using a deck of specially designed Tarot cards.\nTree of Life - the solitaire board\nThe game includes 3 variations:\nsolitaire mode (Know Thyself)\ncooperative 2-player mode (Lovers\u2019 Discourse)\ncompetitive 2-player mode (Warring Planets)\nAs the players place their cards onto the playing fields, higher powers decide upon each player\u2019s destiny, their triumph, or their downfall. \nStarfield - the 2-player mode board\nIn addition to being the central component of the board game, the meticulously designed custom Sefirot Tarot deck also provides new journeys into the realms of Tarot.\nSefirot is suitable for an audience from 12 years onwards and has an average playing time from 30 to 60 minutes.\n\n\nVery early in this project, game designer Georg Hobmeier and artists Eli Baum & Viv Tanner decided to venture beyond the well-trodden paths of the Rider-Waite-Smith and Marseille Tarot conventions to create a distinctive new kind of Tarot deck. This deck would become the centerpiece of the game of Sefirot.\nFor their inspiration, the creators chose the ancient island of Dioscoria. Based on esoteric tales,  pieces of history, and many strands of yarn between, this mystical place would become the heart of their ongoing creation, while also drawing from traditions like the Judaic Kabbalah to which they have a personal connection. \nThis Dioscorian Sefirot deck provides novel ways to interact with Tarot cards, while also introducing the world of Tarot to an audience beyond those interested in the occult and divination.\nEvery card in the Sefirot Tarot deck has been designed from scratch, through a process that includes copious hours of reference collection and research. The deck draws inspiration from existing Tarot conventions while seeking its own path, to create a final design that challenges the status quo of existing Tarot orthodoxies.\n\nThe game of Sefirot may be played on two distinct fields, printed on a double-sided board. The Tree of Life is used for the solitaire mode, while the celestial Starfield is utilized for 2-player variations. Both fields have been developed with the same attention to detail as the Tarot deck, and the board comes crafted in the finest quality.\nRichly decorated with elements of Dioscorian lore, the board not only serves as a play area for the game, but provides additional layers of meaning for those wishing to engage in the divination process.\nThis is one of the unique propositions of Sefirot\u2014play the game on these fields as a simple leisure activity, or, use the cards to explore your inner-self or your relationship with another person. Explore the fields even deeper to discover the hidden meanings of their constellations and symbologies.\n\n\nThe rules of Sefirot are purposefully accessible, devised from a blend of solitaire and other card game mechanics. The game is not meant to impress with complex instructions, but rather to foster exploration and communication.\nWhile Tarot cards have always been used for casual card play, our proposition\u2014to use them in a hybrid capacity (for both a game and divinatory activity)\u2014is new. We see this as an exciting starting point for new discourse within the board gaming and Tarot communities. We welcome our backers to actively participate in this journey as we develop new rules and variations that utilize the Sefirot deck.\nYou can find a preview version of the rules here. Please be advised that the Ace of Pentacles pledge will not come with this document, but the final version of the rules for this edition that will also have the appropriate visual components. \nFor those who want a more visual introduction to the game, the wonderful people of Moonshadow Garden made this exquisite video. It's a session of Sefirot's coop mode, hosted by our game designer Georg: \n\n\nThis project offers 10 backable tiers, and several optional add-ons. We also have several additional items and upgrades that were already unlocked:  \n\nTwo stickers & one sticker set: free for all physical tiers\nFree bookmark: all physical tiers\nFree upgrades on Tarot deck components: any tier or add-on that includes the standalone Tarot deck\nFree upgrades on board game components: any tier or add-on that includes the board game\n Altar Cloth: free for Queen of Pentacles, Queen of Wands & King of Pentacles, can be purchased as add-on otherwise\nOne additional free print for all tiers and add-ons containing prints\nFree gold foil upgrade on art book: any tier including the art book + the add-on\nFree accordion fold with Dioscorian scenery: all physical tiers\n  Precious art prints, each measuring 5.8 \u00d7 8.3 inches, as featured in the Three of Cups pledge\nThe full Sefirot deck with 78 Tarot cards, printed on premium card stock and housed in a slide box, as featured in the Nine of Pentacles pledge\nTwo 1.5\" hard enamel pins based on elements included in Sefirot, the mysterious celestial beings Ophan and the Ouroboros, as featured in the Nine of Cups pledge\nThe Sefirot board game: a spectacular flip-top box with a two-sided board, a bridge-sized (3.5 x 2.25\u201d) deck of 78 cards and a rulebook, as featured in the Ten of Pentacles pledge\nThe formidable Sefirot art book, featured in the Eight of Pentacles pledge: With approximately 120 pages, this 8.27 x 11.69\" book will feature all the art used in the Tarot deck and game\nThe King of Pentacles pledge will provide all items of this campaign. They will be housed in a large wooden case handcrafted by Budapest\u2019s most respected box makers.\nThe King of Pentacles pledge is also watched over by the loving grace of a 7-7.8\" custom hand-painted figurine of The Empress.\nFigurine crafted by Bakano\u00eb.\nPlease be advised that the displayed graphics and designs still might be altered for the final product.\n\n\nAdditionally, you can also get various items on top to create your own custom bundles. These can be added when making a pledge. We also have a handful of mystery items that are yet to be revealed throughout the campaign.\n\n\nWe look forward to unlocking these stretch goals with you to reveal a plethora of upgrades! The further we go, the more opulent these upgrades will become.\n\n\nWe know the Sefirot deck and game board will shine beautifully on their own. But with support from backers, we can give Sefirot an even more luxurious, collectible feel and quality.\nTo produce the majority of the items for Sefirot\u2014the Tarot deck and board game, along with all the presented components and add-ons\u2014we have selected one of Europe\u2019s oldest card factories. With skilled craftspeople and centuries of experience, they will work with us to manufacture every part of Sefirot to meet exceptional standards of quality.\nIn the true spirit of Kickstarter, this project has already been substantially developed. We are asking for your support to bring it to fruition. With our Kickstarter goals fulfilled, we will work with our backers during 2021 to complete dozens of card designs and finalize all the components of Sefirot. Then, once we make sure everything is just right, we will start manufacturing for delivery in Spring 2022.\n\n\nWe intend to both produce and ship from Central European facilities. This gives us a very equitable price for astonishing quality. It also means a smaller environmental impact, since our goods won\u2019t need to travel several times across the globe.\nShipping costs will be calculated and charged after this Kickstarter project concludes. Costs will be collected via our pledge manager, using Stripe. (At that time, you will also have the opportunity to make additional purchases through this pledge manager.)\nThe following are rough estimates of shipping costs for the Sefirot Tarot deck or board game. Note that these are merely estimates. Accurate costs will be calculated in the pledge manager system according to your address, and purchasing additional items may increase these costs. \nEU VAT is included in all of our rewards and will not be charged additionally!\n\n\n\nSefirot is being made by the game developers of Causa Creations in close cooperation with the artist duo Eli Baum and Viv Tanner.\nSupport Crew\nAdditional support for this project has been provided by Small Furry Games (editorial, consulting, copywriting), Moonshadowgarden (ads, additional media), Bakano\u00eb (3D Sculpting), Wobblersound (trailer audio mastering), Thomas Ortsik (research, press), Lisa Nielsen-Spieler (trailer voice over), Reinhold Bidner (trailer motion graphics), Christian Knapp (analytics & finances), Brian Main (additional communication), Sarah Hiebl (design consulting & coaching), gold extra (production support), and Leali Heyman (Hebrew consulting, dentistry).\nThank you to all the supporters who have helped us reach this milestone through the power of kind words, helping hands, and cunning playtesting!\n\n[Original trailer music: Discovering the Lost City by Max H.]\n[Lavender 3d Model by: https://sketchfab.com/mounica.choco9]\n\nThis project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 1,100+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $460M raised between them.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nTo back a Kickstarter project is to put your faith in its creators.

Each card reflects the traditional symbolisms of the Rider-Waite deck with an original stylistic twist. \nWhat makes this deck special is not only its traditional value, but also its ability to tell a new story. With just one flip-through of this deck you will find strength underneath a lion's gaze, wander with knights and kings, and dance beside stars.  I hope everyone who experiences this deck will feel like they are part of its story, as I did when I created them.  \nMajor Arcana (please note: metallic ink will shine brighter when printed)\nTo hear more about the creation process, behind the scenes footage, and more, check out this Art Prof interview!\nABOUT THE DECK\n- Each of the 78 original cards are hand painted with water color and gold leaf paint. A  border and back design were added digitally.\n- Each card is 2.75\" x 4.75\"\n- The deck will come in a custom tuck-box\n- The gold detailing on each card and the tuck box will be printed with metallic ink\nEdit: The original 300 coreless value paper will be upgraded to better quality, stronger cardstock! I'm leaning towards Black Core Premium cardstock with linen texture, which is very durable and satisfying to hold. This is subject to change, as I'm still doing lots of research to provide you with the best quality card deck possible.

My friend Charlotte introduced me to tarot in high school. \"Some artists make their own decks,\u201d she told me, \u201cit\u2019s a crazy project to take on, there are 78 cards.\u201d The thought of a project of that scale excited me, and Charlotte\u2019s words kept rolling around in my mind for years. As my friends and I delved deeper into reading tarot, my interest accelerated, and I began researching the history and symbolism around the Rider-Waite deck.\nprocess sketches\nA project this intense deserved my complete attention, which wasn't possible as a full-time college student. When the 2020 quarantine drove the world into lockdown, I realized this was the window of opportunity I needed to start. \nArthur Waite, co-creator of the traditional Rider-Waite deck and author of Key to the Tarot, describes tarot as an art form that \u201cembodies symbolical presentations of universal ideas, behind which lie all the implicits of the human mind\u201d. I filled an entire sketchbook with notes as I studied his writings, completely enthralled by the little stories he described within each card. I decided that in my own deck, I would try and retell these stories through my own contemporary artistic language.\nprogress sketches\nI first sketched all of the designs lightly with ballpoint pens on watercolor paper. Then, I painted over each card with watercolors given me by my grandmother, a professional artist who taught me to paint when I was five years old. While I worked through the deck, I discovered a small jar of gold leaf paint in a box of my old art supplies. I added a few details onto one of the cards on a whim, and fell in love with how beautifully the gold reflected light.\nThe day finally came when I walked into my kitchen with all 78 cards piled high in my hands, ready to declare the project complete. I have entered 2021 having created something I am genuinely proud of, and I would love to share it with you all!\nThe Deck, unedited (please note: borders will be added on printed cards)\nSTRETCH GOALS\n$12,000--- Two Piece Box UNLOCKED!\nThe original tuck-box has been upgraded to a lightweight two piece box, with metallic gold detailing. Artwork will be similar to the tuck box design above (finalized design coming soon!)\n$15,000 + --- Extras UNLOCKED!\nAs we progress past $15,000 (wow!), I am working on special add-ons for those who backed The Deck tier and above! Some of these add-ons will include:\nAn extra card design\nEnamel pins\nCustom tea-towels with a Curious Travels inspired design, which you can use as a spread for tarot reading!\nI am currently working on developing the artwork for all of these bonus items, and will update as soon as they're ready!

It is an animistic and an ethnic religion based on some myths, multitudinous gods, nature and natural phenomenon.\u3000And the Latin word \u201canima\u201d which is the origin of the word \u201canimism\u201d means \u201cto give a life to something that cannot move without life\u201d and it is actually the etymology of animation.\nIn other words, the animation culture can be originated from the culture that gives life to all lifeless things and move them, respects them, and believes in them.\n\nThe reason why Japanese animation has attracted so much attention is that there is so much energy in creative objects that are created by Japanese creators who have believed in animism genealogically. \nAnd the cards that are made based on such\n\nAnd the cards that are made based on such wisdoms are the JAPANESE ANIME

How JAPANESE ANIME TAROT was created \nin production and finished\nHave you ever seen a Japanese animated tarot with beautiful graphics made for the world?\nIn fact, most animated tarot cards are not planned or designed in Japan.

It went well. With the help from the Kickstarter and Tarot community, I was able to get them printed and shipped out.\nHaving never produced a deck of cards before, I wasn't quite sure what to expect.\nThat being said, there were a few things that I was not personally satisfied with. \n\nFirst - the box. The box was not what I had imagined at all, and I felt that I could improve on it drastically. The new box is a more sturdy box with a top and bottom. It will be matte black with uv coating accents. \nSecond - the accompanying booklet. This was a small insert that provided some great information, but it wasn't very substantial. Not a lot to it. The new booklet is a guide to the major arcana. While the majority of the pages are dedicated to the Major Arcana, there will also be meanings for the suits and the bonus cards as well. Is will conveniently fit in the box with the cards and will be about 26-30 pages long.\nThird - the finish. I got them glossy. A lot of people really love the gloss, but I felt like it may be a little too much. I want to see what it will be like in a matte finish.\nFourth - the lack of borders. I had originally designed my cards with borders, but changed my mind midway through the last campaign. While I still love the borderless version, I have a feeling that the black borders will help everything pop. \n\nWith all of these changes, I still wanted to add a little extra to make this version stand out from the original. Here are some more changes.\n\nBacks - Instead of the gold foil stamping, I am opting for a black foil stamping. I have a feeling it will give them a unique quality that is not found in a lot of decks.\nBonus cards - With the last printing, I includes 4 unique bonus cards - This time around I am adding an additional 6 bonus cards for a total of 10 bonus cards.  I really like creating these cards, and I may just go crazy and do an entire Oracle deck eventually.\n\nI am really excited to take the knowledge I have gained from the first version of Tarotbot and create another unique version. I really hope you enjoy these additions.\nPlease enjoy some of the images of the deck below.\n Here are some links to reviews and flip throughs of the original Tarotbot deck:\nhttps://youtu.be/7d22uGK2kno\nhttps://youtu.be/_LXWFidgEks\nhttps://youtu.be/8smYRi2ZyCY\nhttps://youtu.be/r0xQqVeOxLw\nhttps://youtu.be/u9vPFxR7DW4", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nHaving experience printing and shipping products like this in the past, I don't foresee any real problems.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 15 or more", "title": "The Helpless", "descp": "\u2022 Digital edition of Tarotbot\n\u2022 Digital edition of the Major Arcana guide booklet\nINCLUDES:\nDigital Edition of Tarotbot\nDigital Edition of the Major Arcana guide book", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2021"}], "stat": ["14 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 50 or more", "title": "The Impostor", "descp": "\u2022 Print edition of Tarotbot - Black\n\u2022 Print edition of the Major Arcana guide book\n\u2022 Digital edition of Tarotbot - Black\n\u2022 Digital edition of the major Arcana guide book\nINCLUDES:\nDigital Edition of Tarotbot\nDigital Edition of the Major Arcana guide book\nPrint edition of Tarotbot - Black\nPrint edition of the Major Arcana guide book", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["269 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 60 or more", "title": "The Demon", "descp": "\u2022 Print edition of Tarotbot - Black\n\u2022 Print edition of the Major Arcana guide book\n\u2022 Digital edition of Tarotbot - Black\n\u2022 Digital edition of the major Arcana guide book\nINCLUDES:\nDigital Edition of Tarotbot\nDigital Edition of the Major Arcana guide book\nPrint edition of Tarotbot - Black\nPrint edition of the Major Arcana guide book\nSun, Moon, Stars Altar Cards", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["93 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 70 or more", "title": "The Witch", "descp": "\u2022 Print edition of Tarotbot - Black\n\u2022 Print edition of the Major Arcana guide book\n\u2022 Sun, Moon, Stars Altar Cards\n\u2022 Black Gemstone Pendant\n\u2022 Digital edition of Tarotbot - Black\n\u2022 Digital edition of the major Arcana guide book\nINCLUDES:\nDigital Edition of Tarotbot\nDigital Edition of the Major Arcana guide book\nPrint edition of Tarotbot - Black\nPrint edition of the Major Arcana guide book\nSun, Moon, Stars Altar Cards\nBlack Gemstone Pendant", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["59 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 95 or more", "title": "The Scarecrow", "descp": "\u2022 2 x Print edition of Tarotbot - Black\n\u2022 2 x Print edition of the Major Arcana guide book\n\u2022 2 x Sun, Moon, Stars Altar Cards\n\u2022 2 x Black Gemstone Pendants\n\u2022 Digital edition of Tarotbot - Black\n\u2022 Digital edition of the major Arcana guide book\nINCLUDES:\nDigital Edition of Tarotbot\nDigital Edition of the Major Arcana guide book\n2\u00d7 Print edition of Tarotbot - Black\n2\u00d7 Print edition of the Major Arcana guide book\n2\u00d7 Sun, Moon, Stars Altar Cards\n2\u00d7 Black Gemstone Pendant", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["41 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 350 or more", "title": "The Plague Doctor", "descp": "\u2022 10 x Print edition of Tarotbot - Black\n\u2022 10 x Print edition of the Major Arcana guide book\n\u2022 Digital edition of Tarotbot - Black\n\u2022 Digital edition of the major Arcana guide book\nINCLUDES:\nDigital Edition of Tarotbot\nDigital Edition of the Major Arcana guide book\n10\u00d7 Print edition of Tarotbot - Black\n10\u00d7 Print edition of the Major Arcana guide book", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Only United States"}], "stat": ["5 backers"]}], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #6", "update_userinfo": "Production Update - Addresses as well", "update_content": "Hello!\nI just wanted to update everyone on the production.

You will see new attempts at animation. New attempts do not mean something eccentric.  We see it as the ability to make videos to order, to the project's potential.\nThis project of ours is based on three resolves, which we want to see crystallized. The first new attempt in this project stemmed from the originality of the original work. We felt that the original work had unique expressions not confined to the framework of manga. Likewise, we would like to create an animation that is not bound by the framework of animation even though it will be an animation. All the production members are ready to face this challenge head on.\nSecond, we developed the animation's workflow in house. With Directors Yutaro Kubo and Satomi Maiya at the center, we will look to the union of creators engaged in animation through a totally different process in advertising, in-house production and cell animation.\nThird, we will aim to create a movie with a consistent concept despite its long length. Creating long movies takes more resolve and determination than creating short movies, even in using just one-time expressions. New attempts that seem outrageous at first glance always need to be started by someone with a strong resolve. We are looking to artwork that will be able to stand shoulder to shoulder with innovative existing movies. And it is with this resolve that we will take on this project.\n<WIT STUDIO Producer Kenta Yamada>\nIn this project, the biggest challenge was probably the fact that people allowed us to work as the directors. In usual circumstances most people would think that using us, with little experience in the field of TV animation, would be risky.\nBut the key point of this project is that we needed to think of a new approach to producing from scratch. It involves not just thinking about how to bring the storyline to life but with what kind of lines and texture should be used for the art and characters. We are focusing on these small details, exploring the best approach for \"The Girl from the Other Side.\" We hope that we can bring a movie to you that is new yet unique \"The Girl from the Other Side,\" with the original work's uniqueness and appeal sealed in animation. Stay tuned!\n When the animated short-film was produced before, the original world of \"The Girl from the Other Side\" was fully respected with distinctive expressions of animation. I was impressed by such challenges and potentialities of expressions at that time. This time, with the great cooperation of many people, an one-hour animation, much longer than the previous one, will be produced. I would be so happy if we work on this project together with you guys to make the new animation much more splendid. Thank you for your cooperation in advance.\n <<Message>> WIT STUDIO representative: Joji Wada\nThanks to the support of many fans, WIT STUDIO was able to celebrate its 10-year anniversary this year. To date we have released many works, including \"Attack on Titan\" and \"The Ancient Magus' Bride\" and now, we would like to explore new ways of expression and publishing in anime to help us move forward to the next phase.\nIndeed, you may call this work a blueprint for that potential. Thankfully, the short OAD movie has received positive reviews far beyond our expectations. Due to these positive reviews we decided to create this \"art animation\" in a long movie. We look forward to this new challenge to the diversity of animation.\nThis crowdfunded project is an attempt to improve the quality of this movie and to let more people know about it. We would like this attempt to be an opportunity for animation production studios and anime fans all around the world to connect with each other, however little.\nThis project is a huge challenge for WIT STUDIO as we head toward the next 10 years. We appreciate your kind support to our production team, as the team forges ahead to future possibilities.\n\n<<Message>> Original work editor: Kyohei Shinpuku\nThe sunlight does not cover everything in the morning, and the darkness does not reveal everything at night. This is the quiet story of the two, living patchy evenings\u2014the story of \"The Girl from the Other Side.\" Thanks to the readers of the original work truly loving Shiva's dedicated love and Teacher's poignant honesty, we were able to draw this story to the end. The author and we thank you from the bottom of our hearts.\nIn a world that does not change for the better, how can two people with different points of view accept each other? Living in today's world we are always posed with this question, which is illustrated in this original work by Nagabe in manga forms reminiscent of children's story and poetry. This work is filled with five years of Nagabe's heart and soul.\nHow about taking this extremely pure and beautiful crystal and turning it into a movie, maintaining its purity and in a way that portrays the original work more accurately ? I would like to make it a story that everyone who loved the original work truly wishes for. When I came to that point in my thinking, I felt that we needed help from you who loved the original work, in addition to the original framework of producing animation. Yes, no one else but you, from around the world, who love the original work.\nThe closure of this story work will mean the end of our beautiful friendship, but this project will be a new beginning for the friendship between you and \"The Girl from the Other Side.\"\nYour kind support is deeply appreciated.\nIn Japan, it usually takes a budget of over 10 million yen to create one episode (about 25 minutes long) of a TV animation.  \nBefore we begin I would like to reassure all our supporters that the production committee has already secured a certain amount of production funds to create this long animation, and that there is no risk of this project being completely aborted.\nThat said, we intend to use the support fund from you for the activities shown below.\n[(1) Fund to improve the production quality]\nUsually a TV series requires the flow to become efficient, from drawing original drawings to movies, colorings and photo shooting, as the process involves many staff members.  However, in \"The Girl from the Other Side,\" we will put in more effort and time than we would in the usual workflow, devoting more effort into photoshoot processing to present the original work's fairy-tale-like worldview. (* For the actual image, see the comparison below.)\nPLAY\n\nUsually for animations created with WIT STUDIO, photoshoot processing section shown above is worked on jointly with external production companies, but this time we will organize an internal photoshoot team for the first time ahead of production. It is a special use of the fund to make this work stand out as an art animation.\n[(2) Promotional expenses]\nWe will use the fund for the items below for the PR to notify people around the world of this product.\nCost of organizing advance screening with staff talk show\nCost of producing an online event with English translation\nA translation fee to release production interviews to overseas media\n* We will use the fund for other PR measures to communicate this work's appeal to as many people as possible.\n* Details of the descriptions above are subject to change.\nWe intend to move things forward ensuring as much transparency as possible to our supporters on the use of the support fund. Your kind support to the long art animation project \"The Girl from the Other Side\" is greatly appreciated.\n [Available only in Japan] \uff08\u203b\u65e5\u672c\u56fd\u5185\u9650\u5b9a\uff09\n\u300c\u3068\u3064\u304f\u306b\u306e\u5c11\u5973\u300d \u756a\u5916\u7de8\u30b3\u30df\u30c3\u30af\u30b9 \u7279\u88c5\u7248 \u203b\u9577\u7de8\u30a2\u30cb\u30e1\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u53ce\u9332DVD\uff06\u30ab\u30e9\u30fc\u30a4\u30e9\u30b9\u30c8\u96c6\u4ed8\u5c5e\n  [Special Edition] Comic Book, a spin-off story of \"The Girl from the Other Side\" <with DVD of the animated feature \uff06Art Book of color illustrations> \n*Only Japanese-language version is available.\n        *Another reward of Blu-ray package is available for residents outside Japan.\n\n\uff3bTier1\uff3d-Digital Reward for beginner (\u00a51980)\nProject Reports Browsing Rights\n The rights to browse exclusive reports about the progress of the project and its ongoing products, which will be delivered more than once per month during a certain period (*tentatively from May 2021 to March 2022).\nHigh Resolution Wallpaper\nA well-designed digital wallpaper, which is suitable for both PC and smartphone.\nPromotional Video Screening Rights\nThe rights to screen promotional videos of the animated feature through a link provided in advance of the release to the public. *The screening link will be tentatively delivered in fall 2021.\n\uff3bTier2\uff3dWebsiteCredit\uff06Design Works Data Edition (\u00a54980)\nThanks for your help .

To protect its hard-earned knowledge from the outside world the school sealed itself within an immense, opalescent bubble, waiting for the day when it could unveil the culmination of its progress. But that day never came, and the school was left to molder within its impenetrable cocoon. \nYou, treasure hunters, have found a way in.\nThe Academy Chrysalis is a scenario for Trophy Gold, a collaborative roleplaying/ storytelling game about treasure hunters exploring an environment that doesn't want them there.\nThe Academy Chrysalis takes the feel of Trophy Gold and blends it with ideas of Dark Academia, experimental magic, and barriers to knowledge. In doing so, it seeks to interrogate ways of knowing as systems of power, and explore what it means to treat knowledge as a thing to be treasure-hunted.\n(Oa, the Knowledge-Giver. Art by Ezra Rose)\n(What is Trophy Gold?)\nTrophy Gold, by Jesse Ross, tells the story of treasure-hungry adventurers in a dangerous world. Easy-to-understand rules and quick character creation make it a perfect entry point for roleplaying newcomers, and its uniquely collaborative mechanics make it a refreshing take on storytelling for seasoned roleplayers.\nIn Trophy Gold a Game Master - or GM - uses a pre-designed scenario like The Academy Chrysalis as a framework to tell a story with other players who embody treasure hunters. Whenever treasure hunters want to learn more about the world or do something dangerous, the players roll different combinations of six-sided dice to determine the outcomes of their actions. Importantly, the GM and the players all work together to interpret these outcomes, leading to beautifully creative and engaging stories that the GM couldn't have envisioned alone. \n Never played Trophy Gold before? No worries - the rules are included in the zine. \nTrophy Gold scenarios rely on themes - atmospheric tools that the GM uses to evoke coherent imagery during play. The use of a theme helps tie descriptive moments back to the greater ideas in the story. In the Academy Chrysalis, navigate a world tied together with the theme of bubbles: scenes of encasement, iridescence, fragility, weightlessness, and popping reality pervade the school and its grounds.\n\n(Things contained within)\n(Cover, details not final)\nThis 5.5 x 8.5\" zine will include:\n Basic rules for playing Trophy Gold that will prepare you to run a game, even if you've never done it before.\n A 6-set incursion (i.e., an adventure with six acts) that has the treasure hunters explore the grounds of a ruined magical school. \n Unique tables for character creation, including names, backgrounds, skills, equipment, and rituals.\n New items, monsters, and scene-setting aids to help the GM create engaging play sessions.\n A new mechanic that adds an extra dimension of utility and chaos to ritual casting.\n Approximately 32 pages of content in total - saddle stitched and printed on 130# matte cover and 80# uncoated black and white interior - professionally printed by Mixam.\n(Sample layout, details not final.

Abbot lies a forgotten gold claim registered to one Jakob Weidner. Decades ago, maybe more, Weidner packed up his family of six and built a homestead on a small, unforgiving parcel of land in a desperate bid to strike it rich. Initially he was called a fool, but, for a time at least, rumor was that Weidner had actually managed to find something in the mine. Then everything went quiet. Perhaps tragedy struck the family before Jakob could make good on it or, perhaps, driven to anger by ridicule, he simply chose to break with society altogether. No matter what happened, the mine still sits somewhere on the mountain, waiting for the right person to uncover its location and retrieve whatever riches it keeps hidden...\nThe Lord of Wolves is a grimdark Trophy Gold incursion originally written for the Trophy Gold Incursion Contest in 2020 and inspired by dark legends and histories of the American west, Appalachian folklore, and western horror movies like Ravenous(1999). In it, your treasure hunters will brave an abandoned and treacherous mountain pass in a desperate bid to recover whatever gold might have been excavated from the lost mining camp beyond. Along the way you'll hazard vertical ice shelves and flesh-starved animals; you'll stumble into the horrible history of the mountain and learn the tragic fate of the family that once called the pass home while attempting to survive the ever-darkening echoes they've left behind. Will you return from Jakob's Folly? And if so, would it be better if you hadn't?\nSince the initial Incursion Contest submission, The Lord of Wolves has been edited, vamped up with new occupations and backgrounds, adorned with dozens of haunting illustrations, and laid out beautifully in a half-letter zine format that gathers darkness the deeper in you go.\nWhat awaits you...\nA 26 page, 5.5\" X 8.5\" digital zine for use with the Trophy Gold rpg system\nA tale of desperation and hunger set in an abandoned mountain mine camp\nFully illustrated throughout with both original artwork and manipulated public domain images from the late 1800s\nBespoke randomized loot tables and special new rules\nFive sets filled with evocative props, heartbreaking traps and treasures, and unique and deadly monsters\nFour new Treasure Hunter occupations\nFour new Treasure Hunter backgrounds\nA sinister yet deceptively innocent villain to carry forward into your next incursions\nEvery copy purchased above asking price will generate a free community copy once The Lord of Wolves goes to Itch.io \n\nBecause this is our second Zine Quest project this year, we're running The Lord of Wolves as a PDF only campaign. We know that will turn many of you off, but it will help us focus on completing our previously funded game, ALL MUST BOW, while we learn the ins and outs of dealing with a printed and shipped product on that front. The good news is The Lord of Wolves is already complete in every way and will be available immediately following the campaign, so you won't have to wait months to receive it. It's also priced lower than most other PDF products we've seen and if you grab it while it's on Kickstarter you'll be saving about 50% off the final Itch.io price.\nIn The Mine...\nContent Warning\nThe Lord Of Wolves contains the aftermath of violence against women and children, and depictions of cannibalism. If any of these are a trigger for any member of your playgroup please talk to your group before running this game or consider finding a different incursion entirely. Additionally, the author and Bleak Horizons Press recommend using safety tools at your table to insure that everyone involved is respected, has a voice, retains a positive experience, and, of course, feels safe before, during, and after play.\nSome recommended safety tools include:\nThe X-Card by John Stavropoulus. For more information please visit the Google Doc page HERE. \nLines & Veils, a device developed by the gaming community at large. For more information please click HERE.\nFurther information on safety tools in general can be found on the Gauntlet RPG Forums at https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/tools-of-the-table.html\n\nEx Libris...\nRyan Hatt wrote The Lord of Wolves and is responsible for creating the cover art, layout, formatting, textures, some original illustrations, and all artistic manipulations of public domain art found within. He is also the co-writer and principal illustrator for ALL MUST BOW, our flagship project that just successfully funded here during Zine Quest, as well as co-owner of Bleak Horizons Press.\nJosh Flaccavento helped to proofread and edit The Lord of Wolves. He is also co-writer and designer for ALL MUST BOW and the other half of Bleak Horizons Press. He is co-host of the \u201csuperhero\u201d podcast \u201cTales from Stringersberg\"which is worth investigating.\nMelissa Brigham proofread, edited, and consulted on the interior art for The Lord of Wolves.

In daily life, this can be powerful because we can intuitively know things that others miss.\nBut when we experience trauma\u2014whether a major incident or a seemingly small heartbreak\u2014we can end up holding that trauma in our bodies.\nUsually, this happens without us even realizing it! And what is heartbreaking is how frequently we respond by disconnecting from our bodies.\nThat\u2019s why I have created the Chakra Healing Tarot.\nNo matter what you have been through, no matter what you are facing now, even if you have zero experience with Tarot, the goal of the Chakra Healing Tarot deck is to help you connect with your inner healing.\nThe archetypes of Tarot have been combined with the wisdom of chakras (your energetic body) in this Chakra Healing Tarot deck. With this deck, at any time, you can immediately pinpoint which chakras need attention, why they need attention, and how to give them the attention they need.\nHere are the specs of the Chakra Healing Tarot deck:\nBased on the Rider-Waite-Smith tradition\n78 full-colour standard Tarot-sized cards (2.75\u201d X 4.75\u201d), printed on high quality 350 GSM art cardstock with a smooth matte finish\nBorderless imagery with rounded corners; card titles on each card\nCard backs are fully reversible\nSturdy, full-colour keepsake box\nA comprehensive guidebook to help you every step of the way. Perfect bound, 200 pages (100 double-sided pages), Tarot card-sized, comes in the box with the cards\nThe deck combines Eastern spiritual knowledge (the chakras) with the wisdom of the Western mystery traditions (the Tree of Life in Qabalah)\nThe glowing jewels on each card make it clear which chakra(s) you're working with and where they are in your body\nThe artwork and guidebook are fully complete and will be sent for printing once the campaign is successful!\nIn the Chakra Healing Tarot deck, you will see that Major arcana cards take you to sacred temple grounds at the top of a mountain.\nMost of the Major arcana cards have TWO chakras on them! This means there is an important connection between two of your chakras, and it is a connection that\u2019s worth exploring.\nThree of the Major arcana cards have ALL the chakras on them, indicating key milestones on your journey through the Major arcana. These three cards with all the chakras include the Fool, Wheel, and World cards. \nHere are some of the Majors!\nThe Minor arcana cards take you to four magical kingdoms:\nWands: This suit takes you into the mystical caves at the base of a sacred mountain. These cards represent your spiritual and aspirational energy (how you are motivated, your values)\nChalices: These cards take you to a flowing, watery kingdom. This suit represents your emotional energy (how you feel, includes ALL emotions!)\nSwords: This suit takes you to a kingdom in the clouds. These cards represent your mental energy (how you think, your mental cycles)\nPentacles: These cards take you to an enchanted forest. This suit represents your tangible energy (how you give or receive tangible things. Tangible things are things you can touch and feel like money, belongings, your physical body, etc.)\nIn the Chakra Healing Tarot deck, the Minor Arcana cards have ONE chakra on them. Check out the Minor kingdoms below!\nHere are some of the Wands!\n Check out a few of the Chalices!\n Aren't these Swords just breathtaking?\n These Pentacles, though!\nEach deck includes a 200-page (20,000 words) Tarot-sized guidebook complete with instructions, card meanings, a Chakra Healing Tarot meditation, Tarot spreads, and a Chakra Healing Tarot ritual. The guidebook will fit into the box with the cards.\nEach card meaning in the guidebook includes:\nWhich chakra(s) the card corresponds to\nA Chakra Healing Message\nKey phrases that are grouped into \"Vibrant\" and \"Suppressed\"\nThe planetary/elemental energy associated with each card, based on the planet, sign, or element assigned to each Tarot card in the Western mystery tradition\nTraditional key phrases so that beginners can build up Tarot knowledge\n Tarot Newbies: Even if you have never picked up a Tarot deck before in your life, that's okay! This deck is gentle, beautiful, and accessible. The guidebook is comprehensive and will guide you every step of the way! You will be able to read these cards for yourself.\n Tarot Enthusiasts, Advanced Readers, and Professional Readers: This deck applies a chakra healing lens to your existing knowledge of the Tarot. This can enhance your readings with additional energetic body insights\u2014a powerful complement to the archetypal wisdom of the Tarot. Of course, you can also use this Chakra Healing Tarot as your go-to deck for clients who are drawn to the magical, diverse art.\n Reiki Practitioners and Other Energy Workers: Created by a Reiki Master, this deck can help you identify the chakras your clients most need assistance with during a session. Pulling a card from this deck can help you pinpoint the relationships between chakra issues for your clients. The Chakra Healing Tarot will also provide you with insights into the context and nature of the issue. These are all powerful insights that will help you provide even greater support and healing to your clients.\nAs a certified Reiki Master, Malumir has worked with clients' energy centres extensively. Through this experience and her own healing over the years, Malumir has seen the importance of helping people connect with their bodies by healing their chakras.\nAn experienced Tarot reader, Malumir\u2019s passion for the Tarot is a long-term, committed relationship! She firmly believes that the complexity and universality of the Tarot system and the archetypes it contains can help anyone find the insights they need. This is why Malumir has created the Chakra Healing Tarot!\nAlso an NLP Master Practitioner and public policy professional, Malumir is so passionate about helping people rediscover the inner power that has always been within them. Neurologically atypical and living with less visible [dis]abilities, Malumir also loves cycling, running, and is always thinking about her next tattoo!\nElla Mazur is a Toronto-based artist working in ink and colouring her works digitally to create vibrant dream worlds.\nHer art is inspired by the magic all around her: the diversity of creatures and plants that inhabit our planet, the endless depths of the ocean waves, the enchantment of the forests, and the mysteries of the stars in the sky.\nMalumir is so grateful that Ella was willing to take her on as a client for such a significant project! Ella has created such stunning art that has brought Malumir's written descriptions to life so perfectly.\nYour support for this campaign means everything to me and for this Tarot deck! The revenue from this campaign will go toward the production of this deck. \nReaching the crowdfunding goal means that each backer will receive one copy of: \nChakra Healing Tarot deck, First Edition, first print run\nGuidebook for the Chakra Healing Tarot deck\nCertificate of Authenticity\nMystery Magnet\n And of course, there are some super exciting stretch goals!! Let's see how far we can take this together!\nThe artwork and guidebook are fully complete! That means that as soon as the crowdfunding successfully concludes, I will be able to send the deposit and artwork to the printer!\nThe production and delivery time from the time I send the files to the printer to the time I receive the decks' shipment is approximately 3 - 4 months. Barring any unforeseen challenges, I expect to receive the decks in Summer 2021. I will ship the decks out as soon as I receive them.\nI will ship out orders by backer group (via Backerkit) based on geographic location as the primary filter. My home is extremely small and I will be doing all the shipping myself, so will need to keep the assembly line process as simple as humanly possible!\nI don't expect any production issues with my incredible and very experienced Tarot printing company. Still, I will be sure to update you all at least biweekly on the status of production.\nYour support means everything to make this deck a physical reality! Please support this project so that I can bring it into your life!\nShipping for this deck will be collected AFTER successful crowdfunding (via Backerkit). Why? Because of the way crowdfunding works, if I raise funds needed for both the deck and the shipping, once the crowdfunding platform fees are taken off as a percentage, I could actually be OUT money and not have enough to pay for shipping!\nSo, to keep things simple, your shipping will be extra and will be charged separately AFTER successful crowdfunding (see estimates below). I will be using Backerkit to collect shipping from you; I\u2019m sure many of you are very familiar with Backerkit! If you're not familiar, Backerkit is awesome! It lets you track progress and get updates as campaigns you support develop and deliver, plus it makes life easier for creators by keeping your info up to date and helping to make sure the shipping you pay makes sense for where you live. PLUS - this way, it's a little easier for you to manage the costs, because it spreads out the costs of your reward and shipping. \nEstimated shipping costs: So that you can plan for the extra shipping charge, below are estimated shipping costs. If I can get a better discount once fully funded (depending on the number of backers), I will reflect those in the shipping costs. Here are the estimates at this time for a single deck (larger shipments may cost extra):\nCanada: $12CAD (about $9USD)\nUS: $15CAD (about $12USD)\nUK: $25CAD + $15CAD for VAT (see note below) (in total about $31USD)\nOther International: $27CAD (about $21USD)\nA few more notes on shipping:\nCustoms: Your deck will be declared on the customs form as a \"Tarot deck,\" without exceptions. It is your responsibility before backing to confirm that your country permits Tarot decks' import. If the package is seized by customs and not returned to either one of us, then regrettably, the order is non-refundable. If, however, customs returns the deck to me, to even out the burden of cost between us, I will issue you a refund for the cost of the deck only (no refund on postage fees).\nUK orders - VAT fees: New VAT rules as a result of Brexit mean that I need to collect VAT on UK orders. Lots of creators and small business owners simply are not accepting UK backers/orders at this time, but I want to at least give you the option! This means that I will be collecting VAT at the time that I collect shipping for UK backers, via BackerKit. I am not liable for any additional customs fees or charges your country may charge you though. \nNon-UK international orders - customs or VAT fees: It is your responsibility to be current on any customs fees or VAT taxes that may apply to you on your order. I am not liable for customs fees or VAT taxes that your country charges you, the importer, for purchasing overseas, nor am I responsible for any delays in delivery on account of customs. Please be aware that some countries do not permit the import of Tarot or playing cards, so please check to confirm that your country permits the import purchase of Tarot or playing cards. For customs purposes, I must declare the contents and full value of the package. I appreciate your understanding in this matter.\nShipping times: As we are all very aware, the global COVID-19 pandemic has significantly increased the volume of shipments delivered by ALL carriers worldwide. As carriers work to adjust to these significant increases, shipments can often be delayed. Please be patient and kind. \nTimely pickup: While most shipments will go directly to your door, you may receive a notice to pick up your parcel from your local delivery or post office. If you receive a notice to pick up your parcel from your local delivery/post office, remember that you only have a limited time to pick up the parcel. If you don\u2019t pick it up before that date, it will be shipped back to me (or will disappear into the ether and will be permanently lost!). I will not be responsible for replacing or refunding any missing orders because you did not pick up your parcel on time. If it is sent back to me, I will ship it out to you again, but you'll be responsible for the cost of postage to reship. \nDelivery date: The delivery date provided is my best approximation made in good faith but cannot be guaranteed due to factors that may be out of my control. You will be kept up to date at least biweekly on the deck\u2019s progress during the production and delivery (to me from the printer) phase. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is my first experience crowdfunding a project, and I do work a full-time job. However, I have put my part-time Tarot, Reiki, and coaching services on hold since Autumn 2020 so that I can focus my evening, weekend, and vacation time to work on bringing this deck into the world! I am committed to getting these decks into your life with your help of a successfully funded campaign!\n\nThe artwork and the guidebook are already fully complete. I want to get these decks into your life as soon as humanly possible, so I will provide the artwork and deposit to the printer once this crowdfunding campaign is successfully concluded!\n\nI do not expect any production issues.

As we all know, the global COVID-19 pandemic has been a factor in timelines for shipping services in the past year. Regardless, I will be sure to provide you with biweekly updates on the printing and shipping status.\n\nNon-refundable: Please read through all descriptions of the deck carefully before deciding to back the Chakra Healing Tarot. I will not issue refunds because you have changed your mind or decided that you do not resonate with the deck once the project is backed. You would be free to sell your copy second-hand or used.

(Please note that these photos are not exactly representing what is in the goodie bags as they will be filled with brand new artwork that is not yet drawn!)\nWHY EXACTLY \u00a315388.00?\nAll of the target money is going to help cover the never-ending costs of the tattoo studio I operate. We have had barely any chance to work, and therefore almost no income since the end of March last year, but I still have rent and bills to pay on the shop and after so many months of COVID closure I had maxed out my credit cards, drained my savings and exhausted my options for loans and am now left with 2 options - close the studio and make my amazing colleagues redundant, OR see if I can raise it through merch sales! So here we are - I am giving our little tattoo shop ONE last chance of survival by making these tarot cards.\nAs for a cost breakdown:\nAlthough the latest news from the government is promising, there are expected to be disruptions and restrictions placed on the tattoo industry in the UK until the end of summer. Plus, as I am completely out of money, I can't even front the costs of re-opening at this stage (things like re-stocking equipment and paying staff). This means I am likely to have to keep paying rent and all the bills that go alongside running my business without any guaranteed income for another half a year. This figure for this alone comes to \u00a36,848.00.\nBut I didn\u2019t want to just ask for charity to cover these costs, I want to create something that you guys have been asking for! But of course this incurs some costs too; the production and postage of these cards. To get them a good quality, and to buy them in a relatively small batch (around 400 as this is my goal amount of sales) the cost of the production is \u00a36,100.00. I also had to account for a certain amount of worldwide shipping included in the price**, as otherwise shipping becomes prohibitively expensive, so that accounts for another \u00a3900, taking the total to \u00a313,848.00 \n**(Depending on where you are in the world there are small fees for postage for all the rewards so please check this before you make a pledge). \nThe final cost is a combination of taxes, payment processing fees and the fee for kickstarter itself; if I hit my target it\u2019ll cost me at least \u00a31540.00 in fees and taxes, so to be able to afford this campaign I have to include that one last cost, bringing the grand total to \u00a315,388.00.\nI look at that figure and I don\u2019t know if I am gunna be able to make it. But I know how many people our little shop has touched. And I know that I am going to create the best artwork and pour my love and heart and soul into every drawing I do here.\n\nAlso - there is no risk with this donation for you! If we do not raise the money needed to save the shop, and the money needed to produce the cards and prints, you get your donation back. But please at least pledge something cos it might mean we can keep the studio and if we can then you can still come get tattooed by all your favourite artists here at Granny\u2019s Attic Tattoo.\n\n***For full disclosure - I applied for and received the self-employed grant - unfortunately this is calculated purely on profits, and totally neglects expenses of a business such as mine. As the expenses of my studio are not much lower than my turnover annually, this means that I actually make a very low amount of profit per year - and this in turn means that when my calculation came through it was not even enough to cover the rent of my small flat, let alone enough to live off and support the studio on. I have also contacted our local council multiple times for financial assistance but to no avail.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOf course there are some risks and challenges to overcome here, but the main one is actually selling enough decks of cards. 400 sounds like a darn big number. But I really have faith in my ability to create a mind-blowing product and I hope you can see the potential like I can!\n\nThe other risk is having issues with the manufacturer which could potentially cause delays. But I plan to combat this by giving a later deadline than originally planned - I have left 2 whole months to allow for issues with production to arise and be rectified and still get the cards shipped out to everyone by July 2021.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a39 or more", "title": "Signed A5 print", "descp": "Heavyweight textured recycled card print at A5 size.

The LUNA Tarot cards visualize those who walk in the realm of night and guide you to interpret the messages given.\n\nWhy revisit the Ethereal Visions Tarot Deck?\nWhen Matt first approached the Ethereal Visions Tarot project in 2016, the intent was to stay true to the traditional Art Nouveau style of the early 1900s. Over the past few years, the deck has gained world-wide attention touching so many lives. Many of the deck admirers have reached out to Matt requesting a second deck with more diversity. This spawned the Dreamscape Oracle Deck (which began shipping in October/November 2020). This oracle deck allowed Matt to explore that same original Art Nouveau style but with more diversity and creativity.\nThe overwhelming response that the Dreamscape Oracle received inspired Matt with images to update the Ethereal Visions Tarot Deck. That creative spark has yielded The LUNA Tarot Deck, a revisited version of the Ethereal Visions Tarot Deck with more diversity, richer colors, special iridescent silver foil, and 8 brand new cards (stretch goals could release more)!\nThese two beautiful decks long to be used together to deliver the messages where the Dreamtime veils part and the moon whispers her secrets.\nUNLOCKED: Two bonus cards have been added to the deck! It will now be an 80 card deck!\n\nThe LUNA Tarot Deck consists of 80 cards. Each card is illuminated with special iridescent silver foil stamping unique to that specific card design.

Not only will each card be an original piece of artwork but the incorporation of iridescent silver foil to the deck has exposed new challenges.

Clearly, I haven't changed much.\nI'm constantly juggling side projects in addition to my job making games. I don't finish  many of those projects. I definitely didn't plan on finishing this deck when I started it nearly three years ago. But something about it kept me coming back, slowly making one card at a time as the world changed around me.\nMore of my work can be found at shermansplanet.com.\nThe Deck\nThe deck contains 78 sturdy tarot-sized cards (2.75\" x 4.75\") with a smooth matte finish. It comes in a rigid two-part box with designs on the top and sides.\nInsects, with their metamorphoses and biological castes and extreme ecological diversity, provide a wealth of symbolism that can be worked into a tarot deck. Each individual card has been paired with an insect, but additional symbology is spread across multiple cards. For instance, five cards in the major arcana line up to tell the story of the Fool's Journey as portrayed by a universal symbol of change and growth: the monarch butterfly.\nEach of the minor arcana suits is associated with a type of eusocial insect that appears on the aces and court cards: bees (cups), termites (pentacles), wasps (swords), and ants (wands). Other motifs tie the entirety of each suit together.\nThe Guide\nThe companion guide is a perfect-bound 4\"x 6\" booklet with a smooth finished matte cover. It contains a short intro and a full page description of each card. Here are two sample pages:\nStretch Goals ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAll cards have been designed and the entire guide has been written, and I've received satisfactory proofs of both products.

This desire for personal gain is at the heart of the game \u2013 it drives the players to take risks, betray each other, and ultimately cause the kind of chaos that echoes through time and renders the future unrecognizable.\nRooted in Trophy and inspired by Ray Bradbury's A Sound of Thunder, Echoes of Chaos is a narrative-first system that features players taking on the roles of Tourists: time travellers who have an ulterior motive for visiting the past. Working with the Game Master and their fellow players, Tourists will attempt to achieve their selfish goal, but in doing so run the risk of altering the future in wild and unpredictable ways. \nYou will begin by creating this world together: deciding what the Present is for your tourists... is it cyberpunk dystopia, a shimmering utopia, or a slightly more tech-heavy version of our own world? What do your characters love and hate about the world they are departing from? Working together you'll set a baseline for the way things are... and then watch that world unravel as you loot the past.\nUsing a risk-based six-sided dice pool, you'll adventure through time in pursuit of your selfish goals (and helping or hindering your fellow Tourists in pursuit of theirs'), slowly earning Echoes - the consequences of interfering with the past. In the finale of the game, these Echoes will determine how much the future has changed, through a variety of fun and creative randomized tables... or you and your table can decide what you think changed!\nThe goal of Echoes of Chaos is to provide a fun guideline for exploring chaos theory, the butterfly effect, and other time travelling hijinks while leaving plenty of room for customization and improvisation. Follow the rules or just use them as inspiration - whatever helps you and your players have the best adventure!\nHow to Play\nA session of Echoes of Chaos begins by creating The Present: this is the world your characters will be departing from to travel back in time. The creation of The Present involves setting some baselines for the world: the type of government, the state of the world (at war, on the brink, at peace), the nature of culture, etc. This can be done in advance by the Game Master, decided on collectively at the start of the session, or randomized by rolling on a table. Once the state of The Present is decided, the players choose their characters.\nCharacter creation is a lightweight process in Echoes of Chaos, involving deciding on a Motivation: this is the ulterior motive your Tourist has for travelling to the past and your main objective for the game. You will also get to equip your character with Enhancements that will grant them powers, at the cost of Stress... you might have a cool laser rifle, but knowing that you're smuggling it will make you more paranoid and prone to panic. With Motivations in mind, you will then determine the nature of your Tour.\nEach game is made up of several Tours, where the characters will attempt to achieve their goal and cause the Echoes that will alter The Present in a variety of ways. The group is travelling together, so much like taking a shared Uber, your Tourist may end up in some unexpected time periods and situations and can decide to help or hinder the group as they see fit.\nEventually, after each Tourist has attempted their goal, the Tourist return to the Present, where the Echoes of Chaos they have caused will determine how much has changed from what they left behind. In this finale, all the classic time travel consequences come true (think Back to the Future: Part II's Biff World) and the characters must reckon with what they've done.\nTogether in a single session, you'll create a new world, explore its past, then destroy its future... for fun and profit! (Well, maybe not profit. But definitely fun!)\nWhat's included in the Zine?\nFull rules to run Echoes of Chaos\nLightweight set-up for easy one-shots\nRandomized tables to generate The Present and the effects of the Echoes of Chaos\nAdvanced rules for non-randomized set-up, alternative scenarios, and modified gameplay\nTime travel hijinks! Future-altering consequences! Real-time, collective speculative fiction creation!\nThe Inspiration\nHi! I'm Tom, the designer of Echoes of Chaos. I've always loved Ray Bradbury's creative, exciting short stories and A Sound of Thunder has always captivated me: a team of hunters goes on a time safari to hunt a tyrannosaurus rex, on the condition that they stay on the designated path... needless to say, things go badly, and a panicked hunter steps on a butterfly, turning the utopian future they left into a fascist hell. It's fun, Twilight Zone-y stuff and has inspired lots of fun stories, from The Simpsons' time travel toaster, to the movie Butterfly Effect, to a somewhat questionable film adaptation of the short story itself, and more.\nPrompted by The Gauntlet and ZineQuest, I started thinking about fun ways to remix the brilliant Trophy RPG by Jesse Ross and realized there was a fun opportunity to build on the themes of Trophy - greed, hubris, and the slow erosion of the characters - and apply it to a time travelling sci-fi adventure: and so, Echoes of Chaos was born!\nHaving GMed professionally for a podcast network for the past few years, I've grown to love narrative RPGs that leave a lot of room for collaboration and mutual world-craft - leaving the players room to help develop the world and story they're interacting with. Echoes is an extension of this, with the players and GM working together to build (and destroy!) the world. My hope is that it will create short, memorable adventures - and do the memory and legacy of Ray Bradbury proud!\n...well, prouder than Butterfly Effect did. I hope.\nStretch Goals\nWe've got lots of fun stretch goals planned, from a Campaign version add-on (to play over multiple sessions, returning between Tours to The Present which has been altered more and more each time), to a printable deck of random Pasts, Presents, and Consequences, to being able to pay our collaborators more (our cover art is by the amazing winters860 who really went above and beyond!)\nAll this and more (?!) will be announced once the project is funded!\nSpecial Thanks\nI was able to commission our cover art thanks to a generous loan from The Gauntlet, an amazing RPG community (including CODEX magazine, Trophy, Brindlewood Bay, and more) and I quite literally could not have done this without them. If you're into RPGs (and really, if you're still reading this I gotta imagine you are), please check them out: they are an incredibly supportive and engaged community. Extra special thanks to Jason Cordova (creator of Brindlewood Bay, which is absolutely brilliant) for setting this all up.\nAnd thanks to winters860, the amazing artist who created our cover - an absolute joy to work with and I can't recommend them highly enough.\nAnd, of course, to the great Ray Bradbury: for inspiring this, and so much more.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nSince this is my first Kickstarter AND my first RPG, I have kept the scope relatively small: the game itself is already fully designed and in beta testing (playtest videos coming soon!) and since it is only being distributed digitally (through Drivethrurpg.com) I do no foresee any major delays to delivery.\n\nIt's important to me that you get this game into your hands as soon as possible (and in the best possible state it can be in!) so we're keeping it nice and simple: I will be finalizing the game after the playtest period (Feb-March), doing one final edit in April, then getting the game to you in May: it's already done, but I want you to have the best version, not the first version.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge CA$ 3 or more", "title": "PDF - Everyone Can Play Edition", "descp": "Times are tough, but we want to make sure that everyone can enjoy some time travel adventures and escapism.\nHaving reached our funding goals, we're happy to be able to offer this tier for anyone who wants a copy, but might not be able to afford/justify the expense of the full-price game right now.

Finally, both characters have a Secret about their shared past which is revealed during the final scene if the game\u2014offering a final dramatic chance to influence how the story ends.\nYou might play characters such as:\n A Seeker with a family curse, who is an Elder, Fighter, and an Outcast, seeking to slay the monster which haunts the woods to put an end your family curse. \nA Dweller who once was a lost hunter, now Ancient, Ravenous and Many-Limbed, seeking to reunite with your long-lost kin so that you may look on the beauty of the world outside. \nMechanics\nTOKEN adapts the dice rolls from Trophy Gold and adds a new mechanic of its own. Dice rolls may result in the player gaining a Token, acquiring a Scar, or increasing the threat of the Forest:\n Reflection Rolls (similar to the Hunt Roll in Trophy Gold) are made when searching the Forest for clues of the other. \n Challenge Rolls (similar to the Risk Roll in Trophy Gold) are made when facing a threat of the Forest directly.\n Enticements tie both characters more closely together as Tokens may be exchanged to heal Scars and change Instincts. \nEpilogues\nThere are 3 ways the game can end:\nA player gains 3 Tokens, narrating their first reaction when both characters meet.\nThe Forest gains 3 Tokens, and a growing horror engulfs both players.\nA player gains 3 Scars, and is mourned by the other in an epilogue.\n(art by Ezra Rose)\nListen to an actual play of TOKEN:\nHear Gabriel introduce and play TOKEN on the You Are Not Alone podcast:\n Part One (intro, character and setting creation, start of actual play)\n Part Two (continued actual play and epilogue)\n Listen to interview about the project: \nGabriel discusses TOKEN with Marx Shepherd on the Yes Indie'd Podcast\n\n\n \u201cThe game is fantastic. It is a really beautiful game that helps to challenge how we view others. It asks us to look at relics of a life lived and figure out how those artifacts change our characters. I love RPGs for their power to increase empathy and Token does this so well.\u201d \n\u2014Blaine Martin, creator of the You Are Not Alone podcast\n\n(cover, details not final)\nTOKEN will be an estimated 48 pages, including:\ngame rules, discussion of safety tools, touchstones to inspire your game \nextensive tables for character and setting options, unique character sheets\n6 unique scenarios from guest writers including character and setting options\ngorgeous atmospheric layout design by Cathode Youth \noriginal artwork by Ezra Rose and Madeleine Ember \n Stretch goals will further expand the game! \n(Sample layout - details not final)\nThe zine will be printed by Mixam, on 130# matte cover and 80# uncoated paper for the interior\u2014the same beautiful quality of production as our previous game Candlelight. \nPDFs will include a hyperlinked Table of Contents and will be delivered via Itch.io or DriveThruRPG, your choice.\nAll digital-only pledges will include a Print on Demand code for DriveThruRPG.\nGOAL MET! $3000 - Expanded Scenarios.

Once we reach this goal, the game will include:\n A game soundtrack featuring atmospheric soundscapes, a Forest Choir and a number of original ballads to further illustrate the themes of TOKEN. \n An additional scenario written by Gabriel Robinson inspired by one of the soundtrack ballads \n A Lore Generator which will use a series of tables to create legends or fables about both Seeker and Dweller characters. \nCurrent Stretch Goal: \nAt $6000, TOKEN will include:\n\nCUSTOM TOKENS! These will be available as physical add-ons in the form of POGS (yes, those collectable cardboard milk caps from the mid-90's).

Many folks have asked about a solo variation\u2014this variation will let you play as either Seeker or Dweller.\n   A version of the game for younger players or anyone wanting to play with a lighter, more whimsical tone. If you want to play with younger family members, this gives you an option to create a fairytale or legend together, this give you that option! This will be delivered as a digital supplement, formatted for printing at home or mailing as a letter!\n   An additional song for the soundtrack to accompany the supplement, titled My Monster and Me. This song tells the story of a young person seeking to meet the creature they've heard stories about and really brings out the theme of empathy that's central to TOKEN. It's inspired by stories like Where the Wild Things Are.

This tropical island features a setting loosely influenced by Southeast Asia. You'll see this come across the lore, world-building, crops, animals, and more. Nestled in between the equator and northern tropic, Coral Island is graced by four seasons per year.\n\nThis is Coral Island. Segmented into 7 different areas, your farm is located on the left side of the map, just on the outskirts of town.\n Starlet Town is the heart of Coral Island. Not only is it roomy and features a butterfly garden, but this charming little town also has stories hidden behind its townies.\nThe Beach is rich with sparkly white sands, seashells, and seasonal fruits. On the pier sits a handsome old Inn and a gateway to ocean exploration, the Diving spot. \nThe Lake perhaps guards the most magical place in Coral Island. Find your way through the wooden bridge and discover the ancient temple. It\u2019s believed to be the main source of water and where the island's rich soil originates from.\nThe Forest is a mystic sanctuary for wildlife, filled with ruins and who-knows-what. Underneath the musky floor, it's a hoarding place for messages from the past, the Cavern.\nThe Lookout used to be a place where locals prepared for battles of old and whatnot. As time passed, the Lighthouse is now solely used for navigational aid. Come here and enjoy wicked sunsets and pick some wild fruits on your way home.\nThe Woodlands used to be part of the Forest, but since the arrival of humans, it is now tamed and family-friendly, without losing its green allure. Walk alongside the river to see the School, Taco Truck, and houses belong to those who prefer quiet nights over paved pathways of the town.\n Hillside, sandwiched between the Forest and Woodlands, is the perfect combination of green and privacy. Take a peek at the Vineyard and familiarize yourself with the local Carpenters.\n\nThe Coral Three were said to be the Goddess of Flowers, Merfolk, and Giants. Once upon a time, they worked together to maintain the balance of Coral Island. \nThe Goddess of Flowers was worshipped by both Merfolk and Giants. To this day, locals continue to believe that the Goddess is responsible for rejuvenating the island's water, soil, and well-being.\nSubmerged artifacts suggest The Merfolk Kingdom protected the oceans. It appears they were tasked with ruling the underwater world around Coral Island, making sure that order was maintained.\nLegend has it The Kingdom of Giants existed to cultivate the rich soil of Coral Island. Ruins around the island depict Giants, and what appear to be humans, farming alongside one another.\n\nPufferfish Drilling Corp. is a disgraced company whose goal is to drill oil on and around Coral Island. Set to open this Spring, they plan to lobby their way into the community and collect properties to secure voting rights.\n\n\nWe hope to color your days in Coral Island through music.

Since we've passed our Console Stretch Goals, Coral Island will also be coming to Nintendo Switch, Playstation, and Xbox! \n\nWe understand that localization is very important. Coral Island will launch into early access with Bahasa Indonesia and English support. Shortly after, we will update the game to support the additional 8 languages seen below.\nBased in Indonesia, our team currently consists of 20 passionate talents. This includes both permanent crew members and remote collaborators. Although this is our first game as a studio, our team is comprised of veteran and junior game developers.\nYou can learn more about us on our website: www.stairwaygames.com\n\nOur goal is to release the best version of Coral Island. We believe the only way to achieve this is through community involvement. With Kickstarter, we hope to build a community of passionate backers and involve you all in the process of development. All in service of producing the best farming game we can create.  \nSo far, development has been entirely self-funded. Although we have enough funds to complete the game, there are several features we would love to add but don't have the resources to do so. It's always been our dream to play a farming game that features changing seasonal outfits for NPC's, or finally, having kids grow up! We hope Kickstarter helps us realize some of the stretch goals we have for Coral Island.\nAs backers, we invite you to join our Discord to see daily developer diaries and have a direct open line of communication with us. \n\nDevelopment began in October 2019. Initially, we focused on preproduction and coding core features that now serve as the foundation of Coral Island. Over the last 6 months, we've shifted gears into full production.  \nOur focus right now is finalizing and polishing content for the Alpha that will be released to Alpha Farmer tier backers and above. From there, we'll work alongside the community, releasing two content updates and iterating feedback into the game before eventually launching into Steam's early access.\n\n\n\nThis campaign is promoted by Backercamp. Since 2012, Backercamp has helped 5,000+ creators make their projects a reality, raising over $300MM through crowdfunding.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe've been working on Coral Island for close to 15 months now. \n\nThe two biggest challenges we see ahead for the project are developing alongside community feedback and, provided we reach the stretch goal, implementing the multiplayer component into the game. \n\nDepending on the amount and type of feedback we receive, the dates for milestones on the development timeline may shift.

A purely visceral form of personal musings from paper, to screen, to book.\n\nWithin it are odes to the fantastical, natural, celestial and mundane, with an everyday touch. Some illustrations are present to send a clear message; others just silly doodles, but made with love all the same. \n\nEach illustration's goal is to bring the viewer a sense of peace, a wayward thought, or a nostalgic reprieve - weightlessness.\n\n\n\nThat's about it, really.\nHello, I'm Geneva! I like drawing and fantasy.\nYou see, I like being all poetic and deep and stuff, but have a hard time expressing it in real life through words and actions. So I try to express it and my fleeting thoughts as best I can through drawing. \nA proprietary focus is on people of color, most notably black women. I try to portray the true beauty and softness of black women especially, as so much of this is seemingly lacking in other forms of media. As a black woman myself, I feel as though it's my duty to showcase our grace for others like me and beyond, who longed to see fantastical portrayals of it our whole lives.\nYou can find more art on my portfolio HERE, Instagram HERE, and Twitter HERE.

The Tories have been in power since 2010. \nDue to National Health Service cuts, trans healthcare has become increasingly hard to access. The waiting list for a first appointment at a gender identity clinic is now 300 years. They don\u2019t want to outright refuse you; that would imply that the health service is over capacity or underfunded. Instead they will simply add you to the end of the list and wait for you to die. \nBut they are fools. For you have learned the secrets of immortality. And you will get to the end of that waiting list, even if it means waiting another millennium.\n\ncover image\n\n\nThe Game\nLichcraft is a rules-light tabletop RPG set up to be played with 2 or more players. The play is inspired by Forged in the Dark systems, with a simple D6-pool resolution mechanic. Instead of choosing classes or players, characters begin by choosing their politics, hobby, day job, and magical source, and use attributes from these to add to their dice rolls. \nGive this game a try if you like dystopian settings, collaborative world-building and play,  magic wielding queer characters,  interesting and individualistic ways of spellcasting, and undeath as a metaphor for... something.\n\nPremise\nIn this game, you play trans characters in dystopian Britain,  50 years in the future.  You have been trapped at the bottom of a waiting list for vital gender affirming healthcare. The list is far longer than a mortal human lifespan. \nAs a result you have decided to pursue lichdom. Over the course of the game you will gather all the components for the ritual necessary to become an undead creature of great arcane power, at which point you may either transform yourselves however you choose, or wait things out in your new immortal bodies- you have all the time in the world.\nThis is a game about spite, necromancy, being trans, and a 300 year long NHS waiting list. Although the game itself deals with serious themes, it is set up to be tongue-in-cheek, satirical, super queer, and intimate. \na basic character sheet\nWhat You're Backing\nThe core game has already been written and is available to download on itch.io. Backers will all get access to the digital PDF, available as soon as I can send you a backer email. This kickstarter will enable new layout and art for the current game, as well as the printing of a physical zine for #zinequest3. \n\nThe zine itself will be printed on A5, with one colour (neon pink) and interior and exterior illustrations.  It includes core rules, play examples, safety tools, a character sheet, and adventure generation tables, as well a a set of rituals to help with your ascent into lichdom. \n\nYou are also backing a cool project produced by  a trans writer and contributed to by trans and disabled artists and writers. That's it. \n\nStretch Goals\n\u00a3900 : More art! Interior illustrations for Lichcraft will be added to by Ema (@spookymeal) Ema is an amazing trans artist and game writer who draws beautiful characters. You can check out her work here: https://spookymeal.tumblr.com/ \n\n\u00a31000: Expanded Rituals page by Sam D (@sdunnewold) Sam is the  writer of Doskvol Breathes, and their writing is incredibly thoughtful, emotional, and reflective. The ritual pages for Lichcraft already offer a chance for players and characters to reflect on the game, their own identities, and their experiences in the process of lich ascension. An additional rituals page from Sam would expand this and give more options for the game's conclusion. You can find Sam's work at https://stone-arch-bridge-troll.itch.io/ \n\n\u00a31,600: More art by Kristen (@KristenChin8) Kristen is the cover artist and, if we meet this stretch goal, I'll be able to pay her to illustrate each title section of the zine. Any more money raised after this will just go towards paying everyone involved in the project more.  \n\nAnd our new 10k stretch goal: 4 alternate quarter page settings for th game!\nAt \u00a310,000, the final zine will include four quarter page alternate settings for lichcraft- each with their own unique vibe and one additional d6 table. Lichcraft 4069: a Wargamepunk alternate Britain, featuring an immortal queen ruling with an iron fist, and many, many trans orcs. LICHCRAFT IMPERIUM: The Year is 269 AD. Long have the romans held dominion over your province. But you and your super queer gang of raiders are going to change all that. And also become liches. Lichcraft 1869: A Western version of lichcraft, trans cowboys* robbing trains and taking names. Lichcraft 200069: Trans space pirates taking on the space tories. It\u2019ll work, I promise .\nSpotlights\nOne of the amazing things about Zinequest are all the fantastic creators and projects involved.

", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nCovid and Brexit: Both COVID-19 and Brexit do present possible risks to the shipping of the physical project.

Due to your help, this deck will be making its debut out in the world. A profound thanks to all of you - our backers here on Kickstarter.\nThis Kickstarter is one piece of a larger vision. If you are interested in getting a deck after the Kickstarter or learning more, visit www.herorise.us. Check out the\nFree online guidebook\nArchetype Quiz\nFree Archetype eBook\nAlso, follow me on Kickstarter if you want a notification of future projects.\n\n Archetypes can be used to recognize, develop, and connect to positive Masculinity. \nThe Masculine Archetype Deck gives you a tangibly way to explore your psyche and break free from unhealthy patterns.  The deck uses images, words, and symbols to help you connect to different aspects of your Masculinity. Furthermore, awakening your connection with the Masculine Archetypes can help you move past the hidden patterns that hold you back, and give you the momentum to grow into your highest potential.\nMen seeking to find strength and balance in their Masculinity\nWomen in search of their masculine energy\nNon-Binary people looking to explore the complexity of gender\nThis deck can help anyone connect with the Masculine Archetypes - regardless of biology, gender identity, or sexual orientation.  How you come to this, can be as rich and complex as Masculinity itself.\nWorking with Archetypes can give you a tangible way to explore your psychological makeup and break free from unhealthy patterns. \nThe Five Major Archetypes within the HeroRise system are; Warrior, Wizard, Father, Lover, and Sovereign. The Archetypes represent different psychological patterns that you use to make up your identity. Creating a conscious relationship with the various Archetypes can help you embody mature and balanced Masculinity.\nYou can read all the books you want, but there's very little to help you connect, evoke, and work with these aspects of yourself. That's where the deck comes in. it's a tool.  \nThe deck goes beyond the Five Masculine Archetypes by including two Shadow Aspects and four Sub-Archetypes that are associated with each \u2014 giving you a deeper range of understanding of your psyche.\nThe Shadow Aspects are the repressed parts of your identity. They can be behaviors you have learned as coping mechanisms or reactions to past trauma. Working with the Shadow Aspects will give you a deeper understanding of your internal process and patterns\u2014 allowing you to grow beyond past wounds.\nSub Archetypes are expressions of the Major Archetypes For instance, the Warrior has the Sub-Archetypes of Activist, Athlete, Hunter, and Soldier.\nThis is the full suite of cards for each of the Five Major Masculine Archetypes.\nThe Hero's Journey\nThe deck also included the Hero's Journey Cards, based modeled after Joseph Campbell.  Working with the Hero's Journey unlocks the power of story. You can use it to change the stories of your past or write new ones about your future. The HeroRise Masculine Archetype Deck comes with twelve cards based on the Hero's Journey.\nThese cards add another layer of depth when working with Archetypes. Use the Hero's Journey cards to rise to the challenge.\n The Cards\nTraditional Tarot card size - 2.75\" x 4.75\" (70mm x 120mm)\n47 cards (35 Archetypes and 12 Hero's Journey Cards)\n350 Premium GSM cardstock\nSemi-gloss Lamination\nGold Metallic Ink Backs\nThe Box:\nPremium two-part box\nMatte Lamination with Spot UV\nThe Guidebook:\n4.13 x 5.83 in. book for easy reading.\n85+ pages of card descriptions, spreads, and stories.\nMatte Lamination with Spot UV\n The deck is 25% off for the list price for Kickstarter and will be more in stores when it's released. Get more savings if you get more than one deck.\nSpecial Reward Added:\nI now added an extra reward called \"the Gift.\" By adding $23 dollars to your reward, I will print an extra copy and gift it to therapists that help shape the youth of tomorrow and organizations that promote positive change.  I will be sharing the list of organizations through updates as they are being gifted.\nPledge at the $23 dollar level or ad $23 to support the cause. \nNOTE: This pledge will only cover some of the manufacturing costs, and I will cover shipping, taxes, and other expenses to gift the deck. \nInstead of doing a lot of complex tiers and variations, I am using a reward add-on system for this campaign. First, pledge for the highest-priced item you would like. After you pledge, it will show you the following add-ons. \nIf you already pledged, click here to manage your reward tier and add-ons.\nThe Online Course is an introduction series I created for the Masculine Archetypes. It includes over an hour of video content, activities, meditation, and resources to help you embody the Masculine Archetypes. The course price will normally be $97, but I am offering a discount to Kickstarter supporters as an add-on when ordering a deck.\nHopefully, at this point, you like the deck, but you might be wondering why I am doing a Kickstarter\u2014 it's because of better printing cost with volume.\nTo create this first edition of the deck at the quality I would like, I need to print at a large scale, 1,000-2,000 copies. To lower that initial risk and investment, I am doing a Kickstarter to raise funds. If the minimum amount is reached, I can ensure higher quality and better pricing for everyone.\nI also love the community aspect of Kickstarter. When you join this Kickstarter, you aren't just receiving a product - you are making a difference in the world. By being a part of this Kickstarter you help our culture reclaim masculinity, and empower personal growth.\nI am grateful for your interest in the Masculine Archetype Deck and tried to make the pricing for rewards reflect that with discounts for Kickstarter supporters. The deck's price and other rewards will be going up by 20% when I am selling decks after the Kickstarter.\nWhat are the perks of backing our project? \nYou'll help us get this unique and innovative deck into print\n You\u2019ll get the exclusive 'crowdfunding only\u2019 price \nAll Kickstarter-backed decks will also get exclusive Stretch Goals added to their order.\nMy name is Isaac Cotec and I am the artist, writer, and creator of the HeroRise Masculine Archetype Deck.\nFor most of my life, I was full of angst and confusion about becoming a man. Without a map to navigate my transition into manhood \u2014 nor a plethora of positive masculine role models\u2014 I found myself pushing my Masculinity away.\nWhen I turned 30, I knew I was missing something. I spent years on personal growth, therapy, and spiritual development but something was still missing.  During a moment of despair, a friend shared a book about Archetypes. It changed my life.\nArchetypes gave me a template to recognize, develop, and mature my Masculinity. The deeper I connect with Masculinity, the more clarity of will I feel. It gives me the energy to make my dreams manifest and become the man I always wanted to be.\nI see the internal crisis I went through mirrored in our society. There is a great opportunity, a great calling for the positive aspects of Masculinity to rise.\nThis is what gave birth to HeroRise and the Masculine Archetype Deck. This project is the culmination of 20 years of study. Exploring the works of Carl Jung, Robert Moore, and researching the power of symbols on the subconscious. \nI feel honored to share the tools that helped me find purpose, balance, and a deeply rooted Masculinity.  Thank you for joining me on this journey and helping make this project a reality.\nPreparing for this campaign, I ordered a small run of prototypes and currently have a hard copy proof from the printer. To speed up the fulfillment process, I already set up shipping, manufacturing, and services needed in order to get these rewards in your hands.\nThe timeline estimates are based on the printer and past campaigns that I have been a part of. This is not a guarantee, but each of my previous campaigns I've sent rewards ahead of schedule. Here is the timeline if this project is funded:\n March 2021: The campaign ends, and Kickstarter begins collecting pledge money. Digital rewards are sent out as soon as pledges are received (usually a week after the campaign).\n Mid-March 2021: Money is transferred to my account (usually two weeks after the campaign ends), at which point I\u2019m able to place orders for all of the separate items. Decks should begin shipping for processing by the end of March.\n May 2021: Except for multiple unforeseen delays or drastically long overseas shipping factors due to the pandemic, backers should have their rewards by mid-to-late May. Be sure to fill out your backer report as soon as possible to get your rewards in time!\nTo make getting your rewards as easy as possible, we are working with Gamefound. Shortly after the Kickstarter ends, we will be sending you a link where you will be able to complete checkout for your backing. This will include the option to purchase additional Add-Ons as well as shipping.\nShipping\nShipping can be tricky to estimate, especially when the difference of an ounce can cause a huge price difference (I discovered that with my last Kickstarter). To ensure the best price, I'll be charging for shipping using Gamefound once the campaign is completed.  Orders will be DDP when shipped internationally and the receiver will pay VAT.\n Here are some shipping estimates, so you know what to expect (not including VAT):\nPlease note - this means you will be charged twice: once for the rewards you chose, and when the campaign is over for the exact shipping cost.\nOne of the reasons I love Kickstarter is because of the Stretch Goals. When working with manufacturers, you get big discounts if you get a higher volume. What that means is if we get more backers I can put those savings into making the deck more epic.  By reaching different goals we will add a premium two-piece box, additional sections to the book, and gold metallic ink. More stretch goals will be revealed as the campaign progresses  \nTime spent on the artwork, prototyping costs, and video/promotional costs has already been provided through personal funds. This Kickstarter is to get the funds needed to manufacture the first run of the Deck.  \n\nPARTNERS:\nWe have partnered up with PrintNinja for high-quality manufacturing and Gamefound for the fulfillment of rewards. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have already received a hard copy proof from our manufacturer, so we know precisely what our cards are going to look like (and they are pictured in our campaign.) The manufacturer (Print Ninja) has a fantastic reputation and has delivered many Kickstarters in the past. They currently hold a 4.9 rating on TrustPilot.\n \nDue to the ongoing COVID-19 crisis, shipping may be delayed in some countries. We added extra time in our estimate to account for this uncertainty and aim to ship the product before our stated goal.\n \nOur biggest hurdle is getting the word out there and getting awareness for the campaign.

Willow and the rest of the XII, incapacitated and injured, try desperately to make sense of the world they never knew they lived in. Trapped in the claws of the Headmistress and their necklaces confiscated - the only thing the girls have left: is escape. \n\nVolume 1: Monsters\nOur mousy protagonist Willow lives in a mundane and restricted school, which ends up being the worst place someone could get gifted a magical necklace. Desperately trying to contain the magic within, this act of futility seems to just make matters worse. As the necklace crumbles the school\u2019s secrets around her, Willow is left to wonder if it was a gift sent by friend or foe?\nVolume 2: Mischief\nWillow, Georgia and Emma have accidentally wrapped both Tillie and Aaron into their magical girl shenanigans much to their chagrin. However, things seem to be getting even harder to keep quiet as these magical powers have turned from intriguing to infectious.  Between daylight daydreams, tanking a track star, bathroom breakdowns and betrayal from within - our quarreling quintet might be in bigger trouble then they ever thought possible.\nXII: Of Magic and Muses has been published online as a webcomic since 2016 and after 5 magical years we're finishing off the trilogy in print - before the website finishes Volume 2! It is currently updating 6x a week - Mondays to Saturdays.\nThis comic is rated for a Teen Audience due to language, partial nudity, and scenes of violence, as well as content warnings for blood and strangulation.\nThis will be the final book of the Magic and Muses Trilogy.\nPraise for Magic and Muses\n'XII has a slow but promising start. The setting is eerie and mysterious enough by itself and things only get more and more strange as magic enters the scene.

We are Eugene Leong & Justin Saw from Singapore and it brings us great pleasure to introduce you to the Hybrid Tarot deck.\nThis is a 43 card deck themed around how the Tarot and Lenormand systems could work together. Each card is also dedicated to a deity, ascended master, angel, or elemental guardian, whose story inspires the illustrations.\nBeing fans of both the Tarot & Lenormand systems, we were fascinated by the Lenormand symbols in Tarot. For example, the Hierophant in the Rider-Waite-Smith deck has a set of interlocking keys and the Temperance card has two irises in the background.\nIn Lenormand, the Keys represent solutions. While irises are not in Lenormand, we felt it appropriate to switch it with a bed of lilies. Lilies represent wisdom, ethics and morality in Lenormand.\nFor the Hybrid Tarot, we aimed to give both the symbols of Tarot and Lenormand equal emphasis.\nThe 42 cards in the Hybrid Tarot therefore consists of:\n\nIn a traditional Tarot deck, you will find 78 cards, consisting of 22 major arcana, 16 court cards and 40 minors. However, in this deck, you would not find all the minor cards,. Each full suit is now represented by a single element card. For example, the 1 to 10 of Pentacles are now represented by The Earth card.\n22 major arcana + 16 court cards + 4 element cards\n\nIn a traditional Lenormand deck, there are 36 cards. In recent years, creators have extended the vocabulary in Lenormand to consider LGBTQ relationships and created additional cards. From the lens of Lenormand, we\u2019ve added the main four elements found in Tarot minors to create the additional cards and bring the card count to 42.\n36 standard Lenormand cards + 2 LGBTQ representation + 4 additional cards\n\nWe have already completed the illustration for all 42 cards + 1 enigma card (hence 43). Below are some of the finished work:\nFollow our instagram: Leong Yu Jing (@hybridtarot) \u2022 Instagram photos and videos\nto learn more about the thought process behind each card. \nThe booklet to this deck provides a detailed write up on how the three systems come together in one card.\nThe deck is designed to allow you to switch from one system to another seamlessly with the use of spreads.\n\nExample\nStep 1: Deal 5 cards for  how things came to be, the situation now and how it is most likely to develop. Collect back the cards and shuffle.\nStep 2: To move forward, consider messages from our Higher Self, Analytical Self and Emotions. If contradictory messages appear within the three aspects, it means there is a need for alignment. Collect back the cards and shuffle.\nStep 3: Based on messages you received in the previous steps, think about your course of action. Declare your  intentions and plans, then draw 2 cards from the Lenormand system to see if it\u2019s a good idea.\n\nThere are also two designs for the card backing. The main design is Unicorn design. However due to the colors not working well with gold edges, we have also designed the Crane version to better match the deck with gold edges.\nWe have also incorporated the 9-card spread on our reading cloth design:\nWe hope you find this to be an interesting deck to work with, and THANK YOU for your time and support!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAll the card illustrations have been completed and we have sent to the printer in Jan 2021 to check the prototype before printing. Once we have approved the prototype, it will take about 4 weeks it to be completed, partly because of festive holidays here in Singapore (Chinese New Year). We are already printing 200 units from our own resources to market it here in Singapore. \n\nOur plans to use the funds from this Kickstarters campaign, and also Kickstarters as a platform, to have a greater out reach to cartomancy fans in USA, UK, Australia, Philippines and Canada. \n\nAlthough this is our first kickstarters project, we are very passionate and committed in seeing this project to fruition.

A blocked milk duct, I thought. It soon turned into the whole breast feeling rock hard. One day I was hand expressing and there was a tiny drop of blood in my milk. I texted my mothers\u2019 group and one of them said, \u201cKatrina hon, you\u2019ve got to go get that checked out.\u201d\nI was 34, young, fit and healthy. I was an ESCF Paris-trained pastry chef who had worked for Yotam Ottolenghi and Sami Tamimi in their Soho restaurant NOPI. I\u2019d worked for Jason Atherton at Pollen Street Social, his one-Michelin-starred restaurant in London. I\u2019d cycled a clunky oma fiets through sleet and snow to get to my early morning bakery shifts in the Netherlands. Back home in Sydney I was a mum to a three-year-old and eight-month-old as well as being a freelance food photographer, food technologist, and recipe developer. I was reluctant to see a doctor, but I knew she was right.\nI went to see the breast specialist who took three excruciating core biopsies. She said to me, \u201cWe can wait for the results, but I\u2019ve seen enough to tell you that you have breast cancer\u201d. I had no family history of it. I was gobsmacked.\nFast forward four years of relentless cancer diagnoses and cancer treatment, and I am currently battling further progression of my metastatic (stage four, advanced) breast cancer. I may not look sick, I may have a smile on my face, but I combat treatment, medication and side effects every day.\nMum doing what no mother should have to do \u2014 watch their child endure cancer treatment\nAfter my initial diagnosis, I wrote a picture book to help explain cancer to young children aged 3-8 years; something that was missing when I was first diagnosed. The metastatic diagnosis gave me the kick up the butt to get the book out there in the world. You know, in case I died before it was finished. The book is currently with the publisher, awaiting illustration so it\u2019s ready for release in 2021. After finishing the children\u2019s book draft, I found I needed to let my creativity express itself again. That\u2019s where this little project comes in.\n\nAbout Mum:\nMy mum Jeanie has Chinese heritage and was born and lived in Malaysia through her childhood and teenage years as one of five kids. Her parents had a Chinese supermarket that sold imported foodstuffs and exotic fresh fruits from different countries. Food has been in our blood for generations.\nJeanie emigrated to Australia when she was 19 and settled into her new home. Our family have owned and run multiple restaurants, Asian take-away outlets (noodle bars, Chinese takeaway, satay, sushi, steamed buns), juice bars and cafes in Sydney for more than 30 years. After decades in hospitality, they should be retired, but they're  still feeding Sydney!\n(L to R) Mum's brother Bernard, granddaughter, Jeanie herself, and sister Jenny at 1Ton Chatswood\nMy mum turns 70 this month. She\u2019s an excellent home cook and her cooking is famous among our family and friends. Mum is the type of seasoned cook who cooks by instinct; shops almost daily; rarely follows a recipe but is always looking at recipes for inspiration; tweaks the food every time; and comes up with what to cook that night, based on what looks best at the market, or what she has available in her always fully-stocked fridge, pantry or freezer.\nDriving home after a long family lunch up at my brother\u2019s place at Lake Macquarie, the cookbook idea came to me. Mum\u2019s 70th was coming up. She wasn\u2019t really a party person. Instead, I decided I wanted to photograph Mum\u2019s very best dishes, attempt to jot down her forever-changing recipes, and create a cookbook for her as a birthday gift.\nI told her I had an idea for a project. She was a little uncertain at first, but once we got started, bam! We surprised ourselves and fell in love with the concept and the process. The original idea was to print five copies. One for her and Dad, one for each of her kids and partner, and one for each of her two grandchildren.\nMum Jeanie and Dad Eddie show their grandchildren how to make wontons\nHow we made the cookbook:\nEvery Wednesday for five months I went to her house after dropping my kids at daycare and school. Mum would cook the dishes \u2013 she always multitasks and never makes just one thing at a time \u2013 she\u2019d plate, I\u2019d style and photograph them (and try to keep up with her). It turns out we work really well together. We captured over 70 magical photos and recipes. After each week, Mum would scribble down how she had made that dish on that occasion.\nEach week was an opportunity to share and connect with my mum. After shooting, we\u2019d eat a late lunch with my dad of all the food she\u2019d just cooked, and I got to spend solid, quality time with them. And the family enjoyed sampling the leftovers.\n\nWhat this book means to us:\nWorking on this book together has, for the first time, celebrated my mum\u2019s food. It has validated her keenly developed cooking instincts and shown her how amazing her talent is. Mum would never consider what she does as anything remarkable. It\u2019s just what she does. She nourishes the family. She shows love through her food and through her cooking. While we were shooting, she said \u201cI never knew my food could look this good!\u201d I replied, \u201cIt\u2019s always tasted this good; it\u2019s now just making it look as good as it tastes.\u201d\n\nWhy this suddenly means so much to me:\nAround the time of wrapping up the photoshoots, I developed breathlessness to add to five months of unexplained, debilitating, burning pain in my left scapula. This has led to my current situation \u2013 the cancer has progressed further to my lungs, brain and spine. I\u2019m now on a new third generation chemotherapy drug (for the fourth time) and just finished more radiation therapy (for the third time).\nKatrina receiving radiation therapy for the third time round in the last four years\n I\u2019ve recently had surgery to drain 600mL of fluid from around my heart. The urgent hospital admissions for my heart and breathlessness made me question my mortality and wonder what the heck I was doing on the cardiac ward with all the middle-aged men having heart attacks.\nIt immediately made me think of my two young children who I would be leaving behind and not be able to guide, nurture and support, as I watch them grow into adulthood. It made me wonder if I would ever get my dream of wanting to meet my own grandchildren. Things are getting serious for me, who really knows how many years I\u2019ve got left with my family. It made me want to give my kids something to hang onto \u2013 a piece of me. So let\u2019s get it finished and out there!\n\nWhat types of recipes are in the book:\nThe recipes in Mum\u2019s cookbook are mostly Chinese and Malaysian home-style cooking. It\u2019s packed full of generous, humble, nourishing, welcoming and comforting food. The food that fuelled my childhood.\nSome of my favourite dishes in the book are Assam Laksa, Har Mee and Chicken Satay. There\u2019s humble home food suitable for the whole family such as Wonton Soup, Caramel Chicken with Potato and Shiitake, or Steamed Silken Egg with Pork. Mum is also a fabulous baker and we have captured her flawless Chiffon Cake, as well as Asian desserts such as Nine-Layer Kuih Cake and Mango Pudding.\nDraft mock up of Makan at Mum's \u2014 A Family Cookbook, by Jeanie Lau and Katrina Lau Hammond\n There are over 70 recipes in the book, to celebrate her 70 years of a wonderful life, full of family, friends and food. There is a full colour photo for every dish, so we can make them how she made them.\n\nCookbook dreams:\nMy hope is that this cookbook we made together is something enduring, that my children can flip through and maybe even cook from. A family memento to pass down memories and old favourite recipes, so they may remember us even after we have moved on to the next place.\nPerhaps boosted by my mum\u2019s lifetime spent cooking for others and refining her recipes, you\u2019ll find that you can makan some nourishing, comforting, home-cooked food too.\nRecently, The Guardian published an article about mum and I and how we came to create this cookbook, in a piece \"as told to\" food, travel and lifestyle writer Lindy Alexander. \nThe Guardian article about Katrina, Jeanie and their cookbook\nHow you can help:\nThe full suite of recipes have been written and tested (over decades) by my mum Jeanie. I\u2019ve relished in the challenge of styling and photographing each dish. I\u2019ve adored being able to use my styling props that I have collected from around the world over the last 15 or so years. I\u2019ll be completing the photo editing and recipe editing in the coming weeks. Cookbook design, typesetting and layout will be executed by graphic designer Mei, my sister in law. Website, Comms, Marketing and IT are being driven by my marketing pro / computer whiz brother Colin. My father Eddie is the best PR person you could ever hope for.\nWe don\u2019t need funds for those tasks listed above, as this is our family preserving a part of our history and culture.\nThe Kickstarter project funds would allow us to professionally print the first 500 hardcover copies of the book in the high quality it deserves, and have the books shipped and fulfilled to the wonderful backers who believe in our project and in sharing a home-cooked meal with those you love. \nThe Kickstarter funds will not be donated to charity, they'll be used for project costs such as printing. However, proceeds from the future sale of each cookbook may be donated to the independent charity Australian Cancer Research Foundation, to help them continue to back the brightest minds in ground-breaking, life-saving cancer research.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAll of the recipes have already been written and all of the photos have already been taken.

Now, I am creating beautiful children\u2019s books to raise awareness of the amazing animals of our planet through story.\n\nI find it difficult to read stories that contain inaccurate or out dated animal information. When my children want to learn about a particular creature, I\u2019m often forced to chose between a dry, fact-filled reference book or factless story that features an animal character.\n\n I know we can have both. Animal stories can be fun, educational and help inspire a love of conservation in the next generation.\n\nMy stories help make unbreakable connections between children and wild animals. By teaching them how unique and amazing they are and how they are worth saving.\n\nAll of the illustrations for these two books are complete, ready to be printed into 8.5 x 8.5 in high-quality hardcover books to share with the world. Perfect for Families, Teachers, STEM lessons, Animal Lovers and Supporters of Conservation!\n\nThis Kickstarter will bring TWO wonderful animal stories to life for your family:\n\n The Legend of the Tasmanian Tiger \nBook Cover\n\n The Legend of the Tasmanian Tiger was inspired by my children. They were excited to learn about this animal, until finding out they were pushed to extinction. Then, we discovered that even today, people report sightings of Tasmanian tigers, and that filled my children with HOPE!\n\nTwo young Tasmanian tiger cubs asking to hear the legend of their elders. As their story is told, the young ones learn about the effect explorers had on the land of Australia and the Tasmanian tiger population.\nConflict between humans and animals will always exist, we can teach children to understand the natural world -- not clash with it.\n\nOn their journey they encounter other incredible native animals that have had a different, positive experience with these humans.\nCan a platypus, a koala and a crocodile convince the tasmanian tigers that humans can do good?\n...and run into a little bit of excitement!\nCRIKEY!\nAfter hearing of all the good things humans can do to help animals and environment, the book ends with a message of hope.  Maybe one day, they could show themselves again.\nThere have been over 3,800 sightings of the Tasmanian tiger on the Australian mainland alone since 1936, many people believe one or more small populations of Tasmanian Tigers still exist. A MESSAGE OF HOPE!\n\n\nThe Illustrator : Nana Qi\nArt by Nana Qi\nNana Qi (pronounced: Key) is an avid animal illustrator and sculptor. She lived on three continents by the age of 2, & grew up in a small New England town. Her mother was an international translator who visited dozens of countries, and told her Nana is a name in many languages. Growing up as a person of color,  battling life events, and rare health issues, she seeks to make art that comforts and heals. She finds peace with other creatures, and hopes to share that escape of happiness with the world.\n  Since finding a new style in March of 2019, she has worked on books, toys, merchandise & more. Her work has been featured by by Procreate, natural history museums, & other publications. She\u2019s also had the opportunity to work with conservation groups like the Jane Goodall Institute, furthering wildlife education to better protect them. See more of her work at http://www.puffygator.com\n\n\nI Became A Zookeeper\nCover Art for I Became A Zookeeper - How many animals can you find?\nI Became a Zookeeper is a story about my journey to a zoo career that started when I was just an animal- loving child. I put in volunteer hours at animal rescues and wildlife rehab centers. I got a bachelor's degree Life Science and Animal Behavior. After, I tried to apply for over 200 zoo jobs around the world, I believed I was ready but --I didn't get hired! \nWhile most little girls wanted to play dress up, I was pretending to discover new species. I studied, and volunteered, even took an internship in South Africa to follow my dream! Written with some rhythmical and fun alliteration, I describe all of the responsibilities and experiences in the daily life of the zookeeper.\nI didn't let my lack of experience get me down. I took an internship in South Africa and continued to dedicate my days to learning all I could about being a zookeeper. After a few unpaid internships, hours of studying and volunteering, I finally got my dream job --\nI BECAME A ZOOKEEPER!\n\nThis is a story of staying humble, having presistance, and working hard for your dreams!\nReaders will also discover all the important work that zookeepers do- educating zoo guests, general husbandry, and other important tasks like... \n\nEnrichment:\nSpecial enrichment toys help animals stay stimulated and encourage them to use their natural adaptations.

The interpretation of its tarot cards or oracle, is sometimes referred to by neologisms, as tarology. This practice is based on a set of beliefs, specific to occultism, about the existence of mysterious forces or invisible links between things.\nThrough association with the characters and themes of the cards, the reader may peer into the subconscious mind and assess the direction that one is taking their life to. The lessons these characters learned and lived serve us well in our own interpretive reading.\n All decks will be delivered with a book that will help you with the interpretation of each card\n ( Work in Progress - Lines art Deck )\nAdd-ons: You can customize your pledge in any way you want!

Welcome back to the Alliance of Free Cities, and to the rugged mining town of Sandrock in My Time at Sandrock! In this much-anticipated follow-up to our award-winning simulation RPG, My Time at Portia, you will build up a brand new workshop and help out a struggling town in the most epic and legendary ways imaginable! But before you go on this unique adventure, we need your help to build My Time at Sandrock into the best experience it can be! We\u2019re so grateful for your support on the Kickstarter for My Time at Portia back in 2018; it really helped propel that game into what it is today. So here we are again, hoping we can pull off the same magic!\n\n Quotes About Our Last Game\nWhen we started working on Sandrock, it was supposed to be a downloadable addition to My Time at Portia. But as we delved deeper into game production, we realized that in order to fully express the tale of Sandrock, we needed to start from scratch. We required better graphics, better optimization, more story, and more satisfying gameplay systems: basically, we needed better production values across the board. On top of that, we really wanted to include a form of multiplayer that would really meet expectations for our players, and My Time at Portia\u2019s programming structure just didn\u2019t support that.\nSo, we set a few goals. First, Sandrock will have a similar pathos to My Time at Portia, but offer a completely new experience with new types of gameplay. We\u2019re still aiming for a Miyazaki-inspired kind of world, but with a few other surprises thrown in... Second, we wanted to have the overall story arc be more satisfying, but also with more focus on each individual NPC. Third, we\u2019re going to have a dedicated single-player RPG and a special mode where friends or strangers can play together. Fourth, optimize it and make it as bug-free as possible (we learned a lot of lessons from Portia). Fifth, make sure the sound and voice-acting in this game are up to standard. Finally, we\u2019re going to self-port to the consoles so that we can make sure all the content is consistent across all platforms.\nRecruited to Sandrock to be a Builder, you\u2019ll arrive to find the town in a sad state. Shops are run down, buildings are empty, and people are looking to leave. It\u2019ll be up to you to use your wits and skills to unite the townsfolk and rebuild the city into a beacon of prosperity.\nMy Time at Sandrock will maintain the simulation versus RPG balance that My Time at Portia had, with more depth for both. We are aiming to give the player a truly satisfying feeling when the game \u201cends.\u201d We\u2019re also working to give you a beautiful open world to gather materials, explore, and maintain a homestead. There will be mesas, deep canyons, vast deserts, endless salt plains, breathtaking ruins, and more!\nReturning Portia players will find plenty of familiarities, but still just as many new things we think will only add to the workshop building experience. We\u2019ve added enough gameplay tweaks in to keep things fresh, and also reworked some of the things players didn\u2019t like about Portia. This is not a simple reskin and rewrite of Portia with new NPCs.\nChronologically, this game takes place around the same time as My Time at Portia; returning players will be able to enjoy seeing certain events that influenced Portia\u2019s development from a new perspective.\nSandrock is a city-state located in the Eufaula Desert within the Alliance of Free Cities. It was founded beside Martle\u2019s Oasis on top of an ancient metropolis. At first, the city attracted many prospectors interested in an extensive supply of relics hidden beneath the desert, but, as time went on, the oasis dried up, leaving the city unable to sustain a large population. Many people left, leaving the place in its vagarious state found today.\nWater is a premium in Sandrock, with the only source being from Martle\u2019s Oasis. Wood is also a rare resource, as not many trees grow in the area. Most of the trees around the oasis were cut by the original settlers: nowadays, you\u2019ll have to find alternatives. The good news is that there are vast amounts of relics around these parts, some of them even hidden in plain sight!\nThere are numerous unique characters for you to discover in Sandrock, all with complex personalities and intricate backstories. Many of them can be romanced, and almost all of them can be befriended to unlock quests that will reveal their hopes, dreams, and personal goals, or maybe just a fun storyline to achieve something together with that character. We\u2019ve written a new AI system for this game so that the characters will behave more \u201calive\u201d than in My Time at Portia. For example, we\u2019re planning to have the NPCs interact with each other more instead of keep to themselves like they do in Portia.\nSpeaking of Portia! Being that Sandrock and Portia are neighboring cities, it seems more than likely a few familiar faces will be stopping in, though we can\u2019t exactly confirm who that will be yet\u2026\nStoryline \u2013 Just as in Portia, Sandrock will offer a deep and open narrative. There will be villains and heroes, comedy and tragedy. We also try to expand upon the lore first explored in My Time at Portia to give players deeper insight as to what the world of the Free Cities is like. The themes of the new storyline are similar to Portia\u2019s: that people can overcome any adversity when they work together.\nMultiplayer \u2013 We\u2019ve heard you, and we are aiming to have a specific game mode for multiplayer, without interfering with our development of single-player. Much is still on the drawing board or in the design phase, but the aim is to support at least 4 players in an open world map, separate from the single-player map. Players will be able to work, fight, and dungeon dive together. We\u2019re also looking to create multiplayer specific missions and storylines. Much of this is dependent on your support!\nWorkshop \u2013 You\u2019re still in the role of a Builder in Sandrock, so the workshop is still the central focus of gameplay. You\u2019ll need to gather materials and relics from all over the map to support your workshop and finish commissions from local townspeople and government. There will be lots of new upgrades for the machines in the workshop, as well as some customization features involving the homestead and furniture, i.e., drawing your own designs for things. Being the #1 workshop in the region will still be something for players to shoot for, but it may be hard to pull off without first attracting some industry to the town.\nFarming \u2013 You\u2019ll still be using planter boxes for farming in Sandrock, but with some new elements. We realize that in Portia we had a problem where almost the only thing players could get out of farming was a little extra money through selling crops. We\u2019ll try to remedy that in Sandrock by making sure that there are multiple ways to utilize the harvest.\nRelationships \u2013 All characters in the game will be more interactive than before: almost all of them will have character-specific questlines and have much more dialogue. Initially, fewer NPCs will be romanceable, but we are working to make each romanceable character unique and memorable with several personalized quests for each, in addition to giving them their own unique behaviors. The relationships are, once again, more than just something extra to do in the game; they\u2019re tied together with the overall game loop: if you have a good relationship with a specific character, you\u2019ll unlock perks such as new missions, stat boosts, cheaper goods, or a more willing hand to help out when you need it. Going the romance route will allow you to go on dates with the NPC, and eventually you\u2019ll be able to marry the character and have kids.\nBattle \u2013 The battle system is still relatively simple, but it feels and plays much better than in Portia. We\u2019re looking to add more depth to this battle system before release, as well. You will fight an assortment of enemies: monsters, robots, bandits, and more. Enemies will behave more intelligently, and their attacks will be more coordinated, allowing for better counterplay. Larger enemies can collide with the player, and even send you flying with a strong enough hit!\nSkills - There is leveling in the game, like most RPGs, but rather than gaining flat experience points for completing tasks, specific skill points will be earned by doing those activities (i.e. mining gives you points for mining skills, fighting gives you points for combat skills, etc.). These points can be distributed to give custom enhancements to your abilities.\nDungeons \u2013 There will be three types of dungeons in Sandrock. The Abandoned Ruins are dungeons without enemies, and you can dig safely through voxel terrain to find minerals and relics. The Hazardous Ruins are dungeons that are still classified as dangerous;  they\u2019re filled with enemies leftover from an earlier age, as well as some platforming challenges. Finally, we have the all-new Half-Explored Ruins, where there are spots to dig through as well as enemies to fight.\nMini-games - We\u2019re trying to add in as many different mini-games as possible. They will include sand racing, sand fishing, sparring, gun fighting, and more.\nHolidays - There are several holidays and events that happen throughout the year in the game, some returning from Portia with a fresh take, some all new and unique to Sandrock! From the Day of the Bright Sun, which is celebrated all over; to the Day of Warmth, where people dance around a bonfire; to First Rain, where people celebrate the first rainfall of the year; each holiday will make for a fun and immersive experience that keeps the passage of time meaningful.\nWeather - The game has four seasons as well as a full day-night cycle. Rain doesn\u2019t come very often; but do watch out for the sandstorms!\nCooking - The game will have an elaborate setup for cooking. The player will be able to make many different recipes found throughout the world. The food can be sold, given as gifts, or eaten by the player to gain stats.\nAnimals - There are many different animals in the game world. Depending on the time of day, weather, and season, different animals will appear. Some of them can be captured and domesticated. We will have animal husbandry involving a multitude of farm and ranch animals with a fuzzy cow creature unique to Sandrock, the Yakmel, being the most prominent.\nMy Time at Sandrock will release on Steam Early Access in March 2021. We\u2019re aiming to release the full game in Spring 2022. After that, it\u2019ll be released on GOG, Epic Store, WeGame, and other PC platforms. The PS4, Switch, Xbox One, and next-gen console versions will release in Summer 2022.\nThank you pack! - Our big thank you for helping us in any way you can, it's really appreciated.

But the reason we wanted to do this Kickstarter is because there are a couple of features that we really want to do well this time around, and any extra funding would go a long way to ensure that.\nThe first thing is multiplayer. Multiplayer is hard to do well, and we want to create a multiplayer mode that people would actually be excited to bring their friends in to play. To do that, we\u2019ll need to hire more programmers, designers and artists to specifically craft that experience, and that\u2019ll significantly increase the budget.\nThe second thing we want to do is to self-publish. We feel like that if we handle all the publishing duties ourselves, we\u2019ll be better positioned to service all the different platforms in a timely matter. This will also take some extra budget.\nOverall, we do have the funding to finish the game in a timely and fully realized manner. If the Kickstarter somehow fails, we\u2019ll probably only have a basic version of multiplayer until the sales of the game pick up.\nAbout Pathea Games\nPathea Games is an indie game studio based in Chongqing, China, made up of a team of individuals who want to make fun games.

I really like to draw weird girls with bold colors. Perhaps you know me from Twitter or Instagram.\nThis is my very first project on Kickstarter.\nI decided to create a tarot deck called Memento Mori. It will feature young girls in school uniforms in a dark atmosphere, inspired by the japanese movement ero-guro.\nMemento Mori is my reinterpretation of the Tarot of Marseilles, in my own style.\nI hope you'll enjoy it and I am counting on you to make this project happen. \u2728\n\"Remember that you must die\" translates to Memento Mori in latin.\nExpressing the vanity of life on Earth, it refers to the \"art of dying\", or Ars Moriendi. \nThis motto embodies this project because it highlights different symbolisms of death in an aesthetic way.\nThis topic has inspired many works since Antiquity, in Christianity, in various media such as literature, cinema or visual art.\nThrough my tarot project, I reinterpreted this saying in a modern way, with a contemporary aesthetic, influenced by Japanese pop culture and Western esotericism.\nFeatures of the deck :\n78 cards (22 Major Arcana cards + 56 Minor Arcarna cards)\nLarge format cards (70 x 150 mm)\nHigh-textured premium paper (400 gsm)\nA magnetic box\nFor this tarot deck, I wanted to use the best quality material I could. That\u2019s why I picked heavyweight textured paper for this, a mat finish, as well as an unusual card shape.\n(The cards are longer than regular tarot cards, which sets this deck apart from others which usually use standard sizes)\nEach card has a singular design, with its own title and number. \nCard Back / Judgement\nDeath / The Hanged Man\nThe Lovers / The Moon\nMajor Arcana / 22 cards\n\nAbout the minor arcana cards :\nThere are 56 minor arcana cards, stemming from 4 family of designs (Wands, Cups, Swords and Pentacles).\nTheir designs will be revealed throughout the campaign on my social media!\nI have developed different type of rewards, for the ones who are interested in the tarot deck, in the tarot deck and goods or in the goods only.\n\nSo, here\u2019s a little presentation of the different rewards :\n\n \u2728  The Booster \u2728\nA booster with 3 random cards, wrapped with glassine paper.\n(For people who want to play with chance)\n\n\u2728  Silkscreen Prints \u2728\n Small Silkscreen Prints in limited edition (50 ex.), 4 colors, screenprinted and signed by me. Size,10 x 21 cm. Heavyweight, 350gsm paper.\nEach print is homemade. Because I make all prints by hand using screens, the process can cause small variations. The design of the shapes and the choices of colors were carefully planned, and every print will be produced in limited edition. This makes every piece unique and high quality.\nScreen printing, also known as serigraphy, is a method of creating an image on paper by pressing ink through a screen with areas blocked off by a stencil. The technique is used for making fine art prints.\n\n\u2728  The enamel Pin \u2728\nAn exclusive enamel Pin from the tarot card \"The World\". \nAll rewards will be shipped in February / March 2021. Shipping details are all specified under the pledge you pick.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is my very first project on Kickstarter, but I\u2019m already familiar with selling, handling and shipping items on my online shop.\n\nDue to the ongoing COVID-19 crisis, shipping may be delayed in some countries.

Thank you all for your support in achieving this incredible goal!\nAs such, we have unlocked our final stretch goal: all backers who  have pledged at a subscriber tier (subscription mania and above) will received a FREE PRINT COPY OF F(r)iction #15: Identity!\nGORGEOUS BOOKS for a GOOD CAUSE!\nF(r)iction is a compendium of all things unexpected: gorgeous, art-drenched books that raise money for charity! Helping global literacy has never looked so shiny!\nPhoto by Lauren Renner for Kickstarter\nWorking with diverse creators from around the globe, each issue of F(r)iction encompasses stories, poems, essays, comics, and custom art that dare us to think differently. \nFrom speculative fiction to daring memoirs, we seek voices that are often silenced in the industry, elevating the weird, the controversial, and the captivating literary misfits.\nBut we don't just publish them. Oh no! We make sure our books are as visually stunning as the stories within, soaking each issue in specialty\u2014\u201coooh, shiny\u201d\u2014printing effects, bold design choices, and custom illustrations!\nStarted as a passion project by a ragtag group of passionate\u2014and oh-so geeky\u2014editors back in 2015, F(r)iction has since grown into an internationally distributed, celebrity-studded collection of art and literature.  \nBut we've never lost our roots. \nWe still champion brand-new, bold, and diverse voices by offering free mentorship to hundreds of new creators a year, paying and supporting all our contributors, and never, ever shying away from the works that challenge our conventions.\nArt for \"Summer Home,\" the short story by Brett Riley that opens F(r)iction #11, the ISLAND issue (art by Michelle Lockamy)\n Our Nonprofit Mission\nF(r)iction is the imprint of Brink Literacy Project, a nonprofit that teaches storytelling in prisons, increases literacy rates worldwide, and offers a unique publishing internship for the industry\u2019s next best editors. \nSo, not only does our shiny little journal harness the power of storytelling and serve as the key teaching tool in all our education programs, it also serves as part of an even greater project: to give a voice to those on the brink.\n What Makes F(r)iction Different...\nBreaking into the publishing industry is hard. Really, really hard. So we use this lovely book to help new voices break through. \nThus, more than 30% of each issue is content taken from our slush pile. Translation: We heavily focus on publishing new and emerging authors, working with them through multiple rounds of edits to get their work into pristine condition. Then, we put their stories right next to bold, experimental work from celebrity authors.\nFrom Lev Grossman, author of The Magicians series, to the illustrious Charlie Jane Anders and poet-extraordinaire Kwame Dawes, we publish a celebrity pioneering writer feature in every issue, with original work, behind-the-scenes peeks at their process, career timelines, and exclusive interviews. By opening space for boundary-defying works by big-time names and newcomers alike, we galvanize our mission to change the literary landscape, one curiously strange story at a time.\nUncommon Stories, Unique Inspirations, &...\nWe don\u2019t shy away from work that makes us uncomfortable. In fact, each issue takes a theme and delves deep. Identity, Obsession, Taboo, or Monsters, we publish content from the outskirts of reality to help us do what literature does best... see the unseen.\n\u2026Unexpected Perspectives\nWe\u2019re only as strong as the people who share our vision, which is why every issue features work from one of our Community Partnerships. These organizations use literature as a way to broadcast voices that need to be heard.\nInnovative Reading Experience\nBy now you\u2019ve probably noticed the vibrant, immersive pages that make up our journal. Thanks to our international team of artists, we illustrate each piece and redesign every journal to soak the reader in the theme.  \nArt for Upcoming Legacy Issue (by Zach Meyer)\nFor example, take a gander at our Monster Issue, which we printed with all black pages so that the stories\u2014like their imagined monsters\u2014would seep out from the darkness, ready to pounce....\nPLAY\n\nNot only that, but look at how damn beautiful our covers are! Spot gloss, embossing, and holographic printing make each issue glimmer, shine, and dazzle the eye. \nStories Aren\u2019t Just Written\u2026\n\u2026They\u2019re drawn, too! In an industry that undervalues the glorious (and accessible) universe of comics, we say \u201cNay\u2014objections!\u201d Graphic stories are just as compellingly powerful as prose and poetry, and we\u2019re here to prove it by publishing an original graphic story in every issue.\n The Future of F(r)iction \nThe editors are already busily working to bring you the next era of epic storytelling. This fall, our newest creation, F(r)iction #17: MEMORY, will explore everything remembered, forgotten, and reimagined. Hot on its heels, we\u2019ll be releasing F(r)iction #18: Legacy and F(r)iction #19: ARCANA next year. Yes, we can hardly wait too!\nPLAY\n\nWhere the Money Goes!\nNo surprise, but making a super shiny book full of art, comics, and stellar voices (while actually paying creatives) from around the world is, well...expensive. So expensive, we made this terrifying chart: \nNote on What you Don\u2019t See: Notice how there\u2019s no money going to admin or staff? That\u2019s because F(r)iction is almost entirely volunteer run. Our boss ladies, editors, marketeers, designers, and art directors all donate their time to mentor our creative community and make these lovely books. In fact, it takes a whopping 30+ volunteer staff donating more than 9,600 hours a year to keep this beast going.\nWe\u2019ve been surviving through this model since our inception\u2014with a hefty dose of fundraising projects manned by our boss ladies on the backend!\u2014but now we have a Barnes & Noble/COVID-shaped hole in our income ($8,000 per issue, $24,000 per year!).\nThat\u2019s what we\u2019re hoping to raise with your help. This funding will work to enable us to:\n Continue Paying our Authors & Artists: We wouldn\u2019t have a journal without the people filling our pages. Creators are the backbone of everything we do, and we believe WITH ALL OUR HEARTS, that they should be paid for the magic they cast!\n Print the Darn Thing And Print it Right: We\u2019ll pay our lovely printer to make three shiny, color-soaked issues\u2014with no swanky expense spared\u2014and ship them to you (and hopefully everyone you know)!\n Donate the Proceeds: You\u2019d think we\u2019d stuff any remaining profit into our pockets, but you\u2019d be wrong! All proceeds go directly to Brink, so that the nonprofit can keep using F(r)iction to support creatives, equip educators, and inspire students from underserved communities.\n Reward Tiers \nJust reopened this tier! Enjoy all the holiday fun!\nJust three available!\nALL GONE!

This is a quest to soup-up your soups, sturdy your stews, and work your woks! We are part of the Legend's Cookbook crew and this project is all about producing the Hero's Ladle, a custom-molded and beautifully laser-engraved wok ladle envisioned, designed, and made by working closely with a small manufacturer. It is ornately-crafted and even comes with a rotating, removable coin charm on the handle. Not only will we be producing this heroic kitchen utensil, but we'll be sweetening the pot with a few extra items: a 5-recipe companion cookbook featuring mouthwatering dishes to use the ladle, a Hero of the Ladle Enamel Pin, and a new Legend's Stealth Apron! All of these things are brand new and made just for our backers. It will be something special for all of your culinary adventures.\nIs that a black radish?\nThis is our first quest into custom kitchenware and we want to make sure the end product is something both special and useful. Depending on the success of this Kickstarter, there may be a possibility of doing more kitchen utensils and other kitchen accessories in the future.\nI can smell the fresh-cracked black pepper.\nAs for progress, all of our new soup recipes have been made and taste-tested extensively. The Hero of the Ladle enamel pin and Stealth Apron have been designed with samples already ordered and received (as pictured below). There are a few minor tweaks to be made with the samples so the designs are definitely not final but these have all been communicated to our manufacturer and are ready to go!\nI moved the pocket down like an inch on the final version.\nThe last piece of our quest is to produce the Hero's Ladle. This is the one that is going to take the most amount of time to perfect and produce. We're working closely with our ladle manufacturer on designing the best ladle possible for our backers. To be completely transparent, ordering a custom mold is expensive, hence why the Kickstarter is needed in order to go any further in production. We will be updating the Kickstarter every step of the way to keep everyone up-to-date on the ladle and all other backer rewards. We don't have a sample produced quite yet but we have been working on mock-ups and think that this will be something special, hitting the points of being both practical and incredible.\nShiny!\nAnother note about the Hero's Ladle is that it will be a limited run, which is why almost all the reward tiers have a backer limit. Since this is our first time working on custom kitchen utensils, we want to keep this project on the smaller end of things. As mentioned earlier, if all goes well, maybe there will be future items. Maybe an entire set. \ud83e\udd14\nFirst let's talk about our Hero's Ladle! We aren't just bulk wholesale buying ladles, we are working with skilled kitchenware engineers to design a custom mold for this ladle. The ladle will be made from food-safe 18/8 stainless steel meaning the steel contains 18% chrome and 8% nickel. This is one of most common materials found in kitchens today.  It's used in appliances, cookware, dishware, flatware, and utensils because it is durable, easy to sanitize, and corrosion resistant from acids, meats, milk, fruits, and vegetables. Stainless steel is one of the safest materials to use when it comes to food. Our ladle will have a matte finish and a laser-engraved handle featuring some of our art. On the end of the ladle there will be a special, rotating charm that can be removed and used as a keychain.\nWhy is blueprint paper blue? Legit question.\nRemovable coin keychain on the end of every ladle. It spins!\nThe Legend's Cookbook: Hero of the Ladle digital companion cookbook will include 5 soup recipes to test out your brand new ladle. Each recipe will feature beautiful art and exquisite food photography, a feast for you stomach and for your eyes! Not only that, but there are chances to add additional recipes to this little cookbook by unlocking stretch goals!\nI went overboard with the carrots, don't make my mistake.\nWant to show off how much of a foodie nerd you are? Take the Hero of the Ladle with you on your culinary adventure with our enamel pin! This hard enamel pin is .9\" (23mm) in size and has a shiny gold finish. Wear it on your backpack or on your favorite apron!\nLastly, the Stealth Apron is a new type of Legend's apron! The fabric was specially printed in order to incorporate a full coverage design. This utility apron also has a pocket, adjustable neck strap, and is made from absorbent fabric to help clean up any kitchen messes made along the way.\nAprontastic! (Is that a word?)\nFor this project, we have some old friends and some new faces. Check out their socials and give them a follow!\nPeter J Abreu - Co-Chef & Project Lead - Pilot, Chef, & Tea Connoisseur, Peter is a man of a wide array of talents.

He also has a great sense of humor. His art can be found in some of the ladle mock-ups, specifically the blueprint mock-up.\nPrism - Artist - A stunning pixel artist. He's worked on OTHER: Her Loving Embrace and many other neat video games. He's the creator of the Legend's Cookbook's short lived mascot Nana-Chan (RIP \ud83d\ude4f).

That bonus is a $5.00 page rate increase every $5,000 the Kickstarter makes over goal. That means the more work an artist has put in, the more they stand to make. This is on top of the page rates they've already earned, and there's no cap on potential pay.\n\nLet's GET THIS DONE and finish 2020 on a high point!\n...I mean, yeah, a kick in the rear would be a high point at this rate, but ALL THE SAME.\nIn alphabetical order, the artists scheduled to appear in Smut Peddler Presents: Sordid Past are:\nAnderjak\nLucy Bellwood\nDapperpunch\nTzor Edery\nOtava Heikkil\u00e4\nErica Henderson\nJessi Jordan\nLyndsay McSeveney\nHarriet Moulton\nKit Seaton\nE.K.

Photo taken by Gayatri\nHi, I'm Charlotte, the girl behind cmuins and bananarolls.\nWhen I was fifteen, I found my aunt's deck of Rider-Waite-Smith cards and began my journey into reading tarot (with help from my witchy aunt). While I loved to read for family and friends, there was always something missing when I used the RWS cards \u2013 it just didn't resonate with me as much. \n\nCreating my own deck of tarot cards has been a dream since 2010 and it was only in April 2019 that I painted the first card of this deck. It's a very personal deck and project, where every card was painted with specific memories and scenarios in mind, and are filled with whimsical yet dark symbols that illustrate the nuances one faces in life.\nMajor Arcana Exhibition in November 2019. Photo taken by Emily.\nBetween April and November last year, I finished the first section of my deck; the Major Arcana, and under very fortunate, albeit rushed (I had two weeks to prepare) circumstances, I was able to hold my first proper exhibition at a gorgeous flower shop, betabularasa, thanks to the generous Tabu, Jam, and my mediator, Lydia. \n\nThe exhibition was a fundraiser for my city, Hong Kong, and all proceeds went to Spark Alliance, a charity organisation that provides legal aid for people who were arrested during the 2019 Hong Kong protests. I sold 20 out of 22 Major Arcana original paintings, as well as ran a pay-as-you-like onsite tarot reading table.  \nWe raised a total of $30,000 HKD.\nTarot reading table at the exhibition, 2019. Photo taken by Emily.\nBy the exhibition opening, I had already made my first Major Arcana-only prototype of the 22 cards and have been using it to read for family, friends, and strangers over the past year. \n\nIt's also because of the first prototype that I decided to complete the deck and subsequently spent the next 10 months painting the last 56 cards of the Minor Arcana.\nAce to Ten of Cups\nIt's been a struggle throughout this one and a half year painting all 78 cards while juggling a full-time day job, freelance projects, and life in general, but...\n I've done it! \nAnd I couldn't be prouder of this deck and I am so, so excited to be able to present this as a very possible reality to you. \nNovember 2019 Exhibition. Photo taken by Emily\n\u2738\u2738\u2738\u2738\u2738\u2738\u2738\u2738\u2738\u2738\u2738\u2738\u2738\u2738\u2738\u2738\u2738\u2738\u2738\u2738\u2738\u2738\u2738\u2738\u2738\u2738\n\n\u2727ABOUT THE DECK\u2727 \nFirst full-deck prototype, will update when second prototype arrives.\n78 card deck, 70mm x 121mm\nS33 Superior Smooth Cardstock with Black Core \nTuck box\nDigital and Physical zine to guide you through the first steps of your tarot journey (work-in-progress, will be done over the course of the campaign)\n\u2727 UPDATE:  Due to backer and funding goals being completed, this is now a 86 card deck at 70 x 120mm with 400gsm cardpaper (I like my paper thick), with a lidded box, matte-sprayed gold gilded edges, and a physical printed zine! \nPLAY\n\nL'\u0152il de L'\u00c2me (French, in which the transliteration means Eye of the Soul, but in cantonese, we refer to this synonymously as 'the Third Eye'), refers to both the intuitive elements within each card as well as the method in which you need to read them.\nThe cards, based on the RWS deck, are delicately illustrated with watercolor on paper over the course of two years and are the illustrative manifestations of how I view the world.\nBack of the card which I re-designed very recently, after the I've already ordered the second full deck prototype\nA minimalistic tuckbox in comparison to hold the vibrant cards -- will upload photographs of the tuckbox when I receive the prototype\nI've divided the deck into three major sections as an easier way for myself to understand the cards as well; The Major Arcana, The Minor Arcana, and the Court Cards.\n- all images are print-ready thumbnails and therefore have wider borders because of bleeding- \n\nThe Major Arcana\nThe Major Arcana is a set of 22 cards that explain the larger truths of the universe and therefore rule the major turn of events in our lives. It's also why the cards are a lot more brighter and detailed to aid in describing the nuances.\nOne of my favourites and is now sitting in the home of my dear friend Karen\nThe Minor Arcana\n For the Minor Arcana, I've further divided them into two sections; Aces up to Tens, and the Court Cards. The first ten cards of each suite are in black and white due to their nature of being small, minor events and details in life -- in a way, they're to help explain further the interpretations from the Major Arcana. \nThe Court Cards (Part of the Minor Arcana)\nThe Court Cards, instead, do not really illustrate events or situations, but people. They are personality or 'face' cards as they call it. Which is also why I did them in monochromatic colours according to which suite they're from.\nMoreover, each of the suites represents one of the four elements; Cups for Water, Pentacles for Earth, Wands for Fire, and Swords for Air. Therefore, I've also selected corresponding mythical creatures for each suite; Mermaid for Cups, Satyrs for Pentacles, Salamanders for Fire, and Angels/Winged Beings for Air.\n\u2738\u2738\u2738\u2738\u2738\u2738\u2738\u2738\u2738\u2738\u2738\u2738\u2738\u2738\u2738\u2738\u2738\u2738\u2738\u2738\u2738\u2738\u2738\u2738\n\n\u2727HOW TO USE THE DECK\u2727\n\nWhat Do You Use Tarot For?\nTarot cards are traditionally used for divination (at least, since the 19th century). But like many modern-day decks, the L'\u0152il de L'\u00c2me Tarot is made with the intention of helping you with your shadow work. Shadow work, rooted in Jungian psychology, is essentially the introspective practice of understanding and embracing who you are.\n\nDeck Personality: No-Nonsense but Kind.\nAfter spending a year reading with my 2019 prototype deck, I can safely say that the cards have no time for any of your bullshit. However, while they aren't afraid to tell you the things you need to hear, the L'\u0152il de L'\u00c2me Tarot, unlike the traditional RWS deck, are gentler in how they explain your situations. \n\nI Don't Know How To Read Tarot, Can I Still Use Them?\nAnyone can learn to read Tarot. With this deck in particular, due to the abundance of symbols as well as a guide that I'm working on to help you learn to read the cards, reading for yourself and your peers should not be an issue. This is a deck suitable for complete newbies, beginners, and people who've already had experience with tarot. Trust your instinct and let the cards tell you what you need to hear.\nI am currently also working on a zine that's included in the deck to explain the basics of each card and examples of how to read the deck.\nAlso for those who are based in Hong Kong, I am also very slowly planning workshops on how to use this deck.\n\n\n\u2738\u2738\u2738\u2738\u2738\u2738\u2738\u2738\u2738\u2738\u2738\u2738\u2738\u2738\u2738\u2738\u2738\u2738\u2738\u2738\u2738\u2738\u2738\u2738\n\u2727REWARDS\u2727\nA backer survey will be sent out to everyone who've made a pledge AFTER the Kickstarter campaign has ended; shipping calculations will also be made during this time.\nSHIPPING  (IMPORTANT): \nEverything is shipped from Hong Kong, where I'm based. \n\nFor local backers who've purchased the more heavy-weight rewards, you can either choose to have them delivered via the local post office ($70) or SF Express ($30).

The more this project is supported, the lower the manufacturing cost and the more I can spend on adding printing upgrades and the above. My funding breakdown can be found in the ADDITIONAL INFO section.\n\u2727 100% = FULLY FUNDED. DECK BECOMES A REALITY // UNLOCKED\n\u2727 150% =  GILDED EDGES AND PHYSICAL ZINE // UNLOCKED\n\u2727 200% = LIDDED BOX // UNLOCKED\nWhat are Stretch Goals? \nA STRETCH GOAL is a designated monetary goal for when a campaign reaches its initial funding goal. If your pledge tier includes a deck, once the stretch goal amount is reached, you will receive that item FOR FREE.\n\nStretch goals are incentives for backers to help spread the word on social media. Sharing, re-posting, and word of mouth will make this Kickstarter campaign advantageous for everyone! \nThree of Cups - Tell your friends!!\n\u2738\u2738\u2738\u2738\u2738\u2738\u2738\u2738\u2738\u2738\u2738\u2738\u2738\u2738\u2738\u2738\u2738\u2738\u2738\u2738\u2738\u2738\u2738\u2738\n\u2727YOUR PLEDGE\u2727\nYou will be charged for the amount you pledged at the end of the campaign, only if the project reaches its funding goal.\nYou can adjust your pledge at any time you want.\nI will send out post-campaign surveys to collect any information (shipping address, emails.etc) that I need to get your rewards to you!\n\u2738\u2738\u2738\u2738\u2738\u2738\u2738\u2738\u2738\u2738\u2738\u2738\u2738\u2738\u2738\u2738\u2738\u2738\u2738\u2738\u2738\u2738\u2738\n\u2727ADDITIONAL INFO\u2727 \nWhy Kickstarter?: \nKickstarter is a crowd-funding platform that also allows me to garner interested buyers and supporters for my project -- this way I don't need to risk spending a large amount of money (which I also don't have) for no audience. \nKickstarter is also an ALL-OR-NOTHING platform; if I don't reach my funding goal, your money will automatically be refunded. So it's a very backer-oriented campaign platform.\n\nPrinting & Sourcing: \nI prioritise printing and sourcing my reward items locally in Hong Kong, with a preference to support small and local businesses. Due to this, manufacturing costs are higher than if I were to source them from Mainland China factories. \nShop small, shop local, friends. \n\nFulfillment and Delivery Date: \nI've set the delivery date to April 2021 to give myself a (huge) cushion for production.etc. But these dates would be moved up if this project gets funded! \nI'm so sorry but I will probably not be able to make these decks available in time for Christmas this year.\n\nFunding Breakdown:\nPrototyping and Production 80% / Kickstarter Fee 10% / Labour & Other Fees 10% \n** Apologies, I forgot to remove the shipping option for Hong Kong locals who are buying the deck only -- I will refund the $30 if you do not require shipping**\n\u2738\u2738\u2738\u2738\u2738\u2738\u2738\u2738\u2738\u2738\u2738\u2738\u2738\u2738\u2738\u2738\u2738\u2738\u2738\u2738\u2738\u2738\n\u2727Thank you so much for being here and supporting my project <3\u2727\nShout out to my family, my close friends, and my very supportive colleagues for supporting this project for the last two years and constantly giving me feedback <3 \n\nExtra shout out to Yiting and David for being my rocks when I was stressed out of my mind and for lightening my load, to my boss Elaine whose continuous encouragement was what started it all, to Lydia who connected me to Tabu and Jam from betabularasa who very kindly allowed me to hold the fundraiser exhibition at their shop which aided me to this next step of the project, and to Mike from Startkiz who very kindly offered me a free consultation and whose advice for this project was invaluable.\n\nThis deck is dedicated to my aunt who taught me magic, and to my mom who taught me to believe in it.\n\nIf you want to stay updated regarding the deck or if you're interested in my other work, check out my instagram (cmuins) for more :) \nLittle Wolf at the exhibition. Photo taken by Jam and Tabu", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is my first crowdfunding campaign as well as the first large-scale print production project I'm setting out to create so I'm learning as I go. However the full deck design is complete and ready to go with my only risks being the following:\n\n1. Exposure \nI work a full time day job as well as freelancing work which means I only work on my art in the after-hours and on weekends. Also I do not have a large following on social media which also poses a risk for a successful Kickstarter.\n\nTo tackle that, I am learning to reach out to media outlets to promote my project but there's only so much one pair of hands can do. \n\nYour help to spread the word about this project is essential! Just sharing, reposting, and telling your friends about this deck could be crucial to bringing in more backers which will contribute to you getting your rewards as well! It's a win-win for all!\n\n2. Unexpected Shipping Delays\n2020 has been a wild year and no one knows what will come for us next -- I cannot guarantee shipping on time due to unexpected Co-Vid19 delays but that's also why I've given myself such a large time cushion for estimated delivery dates. Other than that, I will also keep everyone updated should such issues arise. \n\n3. Guide (Digital and Physical Zine)\nI am currently still working on the guide as to how to use the deck, read the cards, and each card's explanations but I am confident that I will finish it over the course of the Kickstarter campaign. Should there be any delays, I will keep everyone updated. \n\nThe illustrations of the deck is fully done.\n\nIf you have any questions, you can shoot me a message or even find me on Instagram.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge HK$ 50 or more", "title": "Thank You!", "descp": "Thank you for supporting my project, it means the world <3\nINCLUDES:\nSigned and Personalised Thank You Postcard", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Apr 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["8 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge HK$ 120 or more", "title": "Omen", "descp": "INCLUDES:\nSigned and Personalised Thank You Postcard\nSticker Pack\nOne Card Reading on a Tarot Postcard", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Apr 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["8 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge HK$ 250 or more", "title": "Believer", "descp": "Don't want a deck?

It is a roleplaying system built on the foundations of interpretation, procedural generation, and collaborative storytelling.\nWHAT\u2019S THE OBJECTIVE?\nThe objective of the game is to tell a satisfying story.  Your character might win wealth and respect and come away from the adventure a better person; they might crash and burn, and end the story as a warning to others.  Both of these are victories if they fit the arc of the story you\u2019ve told, and bring satisfaction to you as a storyteller.\nHOW DO YOU PLAY?\nFool: wide eyed and open hearted, unfettered by cynicism or context/close minded and stubborn, faith borne of spite\n\nSpindlewheel\u2019s fundamental verb is interpretation.\nEach card\u2019s text evokes an idea.  The upright and inverse text are different. Sometimes they\u2019re diametrically opposed; often, they\u2019re two sides of the same coin.\nUse the card as an anchor for the part of the story that you\u2019re telling.\nA card can be a person, an event, an attitude, or a physical object. You can use as much as the entire card, or as little as a single word. A card is interpreted twice: once when it enters your hand, and again when you play it. It does not have to be the same interpretation.\nFOR EXAMPLE: I might draw the Hearth card and reflect that I feel like people closed their doors to me; but I might engage that card later, declaring I won\u2019t do the same to someone else, and play it to invite someone into my home.\n\nHearth: A crackling fire, a hot meal, a roof overheard, a comfortable silence // closing doors, turning a blind eye, keeping your head low, weathering the storm\n\nBegin the game by interpreting a spread of cards together, and collaboratively building a World. These cards become the Arbiter's deck, a simple Game Master AI which anyone can draw and play cards for (and everyone should).\nIndividually, interpret a spread of cards to create your character, reading their strengths and weaknesses, their methods and their heart\u2019s Desire; take a glimpse into their history, and potential end, with their Clotho, Lachesis, and Atropos cards.\nThese cards become your hand.\nDuring the game, scenes are seeded by story Events like An Invitation or Acts like Act III: The Big Showdown; cards played from the Arbiter's deck complicate the situation. You\u2019ll play cards from your hand to describe what your character says, does, or what details you add to the story; or, draw from the deck to introspect, and reflect on how your character feels or changes.\nUse the concepts in the cards as anchors to justify your actions, as inspiration to add details and color to the scene, or as the jumping-off point for an idea you\u2019re excited to explore.\nSpindlewheel is a loom on which you weave stories, placing cards like threads to intertwine and complicate the tale. It\u2019s also genre-agnostic: The deck might give you a Princess, a Plague, a Witch with a Cursed Sword, a Trickster, and a Tin Penny; whether it describes the fate of a kingdom or a bizarre encounter at a bus stop is up to you!\nWhat's the Kickstarter for?\nThis Kickstarter is for the very first official print run of the Spindlewheel deck! Up to this point, Spindlewheel has only been available as a print-and-play deck, or through surreptitious prototype copies during its open beta. Now that the system is finalized, it's time to make it available for everyone!\nThe deck includes: \n103 unique tarot-like cards with text prompts and evocative art \none X-card\nOne beautiful box to store everything in.\nAlso, it's for the Spindlewheel rulebook! You may be familiar with Spindlewheel from the open beta, or from the Microgames collection on itch.io.  There are also dozens of other games by other designers who use Spindlewheel as their resolution mechanic!\nWhat will it look like? How is it being printed?\nWe're glad you asked! Spindlewheel will be printed through Board Games Maker, on S30 cardstock, gamer standard size, and with a rigid box to store it all in. We don't have a picture of what that proof will look like, but here's a mock up of a current proof we have\n The basic rules will be included in the deck itself, on an 8 fold pamphlet. This is all you need to play the game. If you're interested in the nitty gritty of how Spindlewheel works, we will also have the digital SRD and Festival/Longform rulebooks that go into rules in depth.\nWho's Involved?\nSasha Reneau (they/them or en/ens) is the designer and illustrator of Spindlewheel. En is host of Spindlewheel Stories and designer of Spindlewheel Microgames as well as a bevy of other games on en's itch.io. Find them on twitter at @sasha_reneau or ens game design meanderings @teacabbage.\nAsh Pana (they/them) is a Los Angeles based editor, writer, and illustrator.  They can frequently be found creating sapphic speculative fiction, if needed for a rousing intergalactic adventure. Find them on twitter at @somuchpanash.\nRiley Lyra Hopkins (he/they) is the kickstarter producer. They've run two separate kickstarters that have funded and shipped, and create their own games at www.linksmithgames.com! They can be found on Twitter @RevRyeBread and on many podcasts!\nHear it played on Spindlewheel Stories, or featured on these wonderful podcasts:\nParty of One: part 1 / part 2 / Detective\nYou Don't Meet In An Inn: Festival / Detective\nGames Closet interview!\nIf Not Us, Then Who? Season 2 - One / Two / Three\nHow's the money shake out?\nOur current Kickstarter funds are set up to be distributed like this!\n\nA graph of where the money is going!\n\nSince the game is already entirely done, we don't need to worry about art production or anything like that. This is a completed product just waiting for the shipyard!\nThis is mainly just to print the game and get it shipped out to you!\nWhat are the backer levels?\n$1: VAGABOND - you want to see what happens! you don't get a reward, but you get thanks.\n$15: MERCHANT - digital play edition! A digital playspace on roll20, Tabletop Simulator, and Role, and the updated print-and-play pdf's with the new pretty art on it.

Each deck will be upgraded to have a GILDED EDGE, to give Spindlewheel that regal and fancy look.\n17,650 -   If we can hit this stretch goal, we will be reaching out to three ttrpg designers throughout the scene to make themed expansions of 15 cards each! These will be added into the game with art and unique card backs, they can be shuffled into the game at will! \nThis stretch goal pays for the art, the editing, the contracting, and the printing of these new, gilt edge cards. \n31,250 - We will be reaching out to three more designers to add their cards to the deck!

Once the book is finished it will be published in a number of online bookstores. See also the Facebook page where you find the latest updates and news about the book.\nStretch Goals\nAll stretch goals are now unlocked!\nStory\nThis is a cookbook with solid everyday recipes visualised using flowcharts for better readability/understanding and usability than what you get from a traditionally formatted cookbook.\nExample of a flowchart recipe. Community Recipe #1: Chicken Tikka Masala\nDo you ever find yourself frustrated or confused when trying to follow along with a traditional cooking recipe?\nThe more you cook the more you realise that cooking is often not as straight forward as a linear step by step instruction make it out to be. There is a fair share of decision making, probing, and parallel processing, which is not easily communicated in a linear text recipe.\nAnd why are recipes online always buried under a wall of text blog post?\nThe traditional cooking recipe describes a step by step workflow as essentially a numbered list of actions to take in one long sequence. What you are unable to glance from a traditional recipe is what parts of the workflow can be prepared in advance or in parallel with other tasks. You can try to solve this problem by reading the whole recipe in advance before you start cooking and then keep your knowledge of what actions will come next in memory as you cook the dish. This of course put a heavy toll on your cognition, and the longer the recipe the harder it gets.\nHow can we improve the recipe format?\nThere are of course many ways to make recipes easier to read, and I have seen many well written recipes which get creative with the formatting using colour coding, margin notes, etc. but ultimately it still follows the same numbered list format.\nPersonally, working as an engineer in software development, I read and review hundreds of pages of technical documentation every year, and one of the things I often request for is for more visualisations of the often very verbose descriptions for better readability. A generally accepted assumption in the field of cognitive psychology is that people learn better if they are taught using more than one sense (or modality) (The New Handbook of Multi-sensory Processing, Barry E. Stein, 2012).\nWhen you visualise processes, designs, time plans, etc. your teams mental image become more aligned. With a new angle, or view point to the topic you understand the problem domain in a new and deeper way and sometimes a good visualisation reveals issues which you were completely blind to before.\nThis is where flowcharts commonly used in engineering comes into play. Flowcharts are a type of diagram which describe a process, workflow or algorithm which solves a task in a step by step manner. The beauty of a flowchart is that you can glance the \u201cbig picture\u201d at any time and easily keep track of your progress. A flowchart simplifies decision making and visualise loops and forks (parallel execution). Something which is hard to convey in a purely text formatted recipe.\nIn this cookbook, every recipe is presented in two ways, with the traditional text format, and with a flowchart - so you can compare the two, and utilise the strengths of both ways.\nThis is a mockup, final layout TBD\nBelow is a Work In Progress sample spread from the book. Note that the sample is exported at low resolution and there are still many things which might change.\nClick the image for a higher resolution sample.\nHere I flip thru the pages of the current book draft printed with a black ink with a laser printer. Note that this is not indicative of the final print quality.\nWho is this book for?\nThis book is for the visual thinkers, people nerdy enough to be fluent in flowcharts. This is for those of us who are fed up with Search Engine Optimised (SEO) food blogs where you have to scroll past useless anecdotes and ramblings to get to the actual recipe.\nA good flowchart is like a form of humour to a certain type of people. I just find it oddly satisfying to look at. I imagine that this cookbook might be a good coffee table book for the office, the \"man cave\" or \"nerd cave\".\nThe perfect birthday gift for your engineer spouse or friend! ;)\n\nBook Content\nSince this is my first book project I am following the KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid!) principle, and sticking to a condensed set of 20 solid and traditional recipes which I cook regularly at home to feed 2 kids and wife. I would say that the majority of the recipes are in what we in Sweden call the \"husman\" style (traditional Nordic home cooking). Many of the recipes are an inheritance from my own mother, so there are are fair bit of Finnish recipes as well.\nMom\u2019s Pirogues - Finnish Pirogues which are baked In the oven rather than oil fried\n\u201dRaggmunk\u201d - Swedish potato pancakes\nLasagna - kids favourite\nI will also include 5 \u201dcommunity recipes\u201d which are popular voted recipes from the reddit forum r/flowchartrecipes. These five recipes are also the base for a couple of the backer rewards, the digital and physical posters. See further down for a preview of the posters.\nCommunity Recipe #2: Night Rise Breakfast Bread (Note: this is a mockup. Final poster layout TBD)\nThe Author\nMy name is Sami Matilainen and I work with software development and I\u2019m passionate about visualisation and usability. I'm born and raised in Sweden but my roots are in Finland so what I call \"home cooking\" is generally a mix of these two styles. Being a father of two (kids are 1 and 4 years old) means that any dish I make need to appeal to my two very picky eaters.\nPrototype 1: The first ever flowchart recipe I made. I glued it to the book...\nI have been using flowcharts as short hand notes when cooking for well over a decade now, but it was only recently when looking for a new recipe online, with the usual frustration over the numerous blog style recipe sites, that I came to think that maybe someone else also had thought to create recipes using flowcharts. I found some examples here and there, but not really up to the level that I was expecting. So this is where the idea to write this book came from.\n\nRewards\nBy pledging to this Kickstarter campaign you are not only supporting me with this project, you are also telling me there is a demand for more. If this project become a success, there are many ways this can be explored further. For instance, a website or app version could add some dynamics like the ability to tick off steps you have performed etc. Where this goes only time will tell, but I need your help to make it happen!\nThe eBook comes with free updates to the first edition, so if I correct some errors or add some minor content in the book at a later date, you will receive the updated version for free.\nIf you want to order more copies of the book, simply add 225SEK (10% discount) to your pledge for each additional book you want to order.\n\nPledge Reward Tiers\nNote: Currency conversions shown here are a rough estimate. Kickstarter will show you an updated price based on the currency conversion applicable when you make your pledge.\nCommunity Recipe Posters\nThese are the five posters you can chooe from if you chose a reward which included one or all of the posters. The physical posters will be printed in A4 size (210 x 297 mm | 8,27\" x 11,69\") and the digital posters should be high enough resolution to print up to A3 size (297 x 420 mm | 11.7\" x 16.5\").\nClick the link for a larger preview\nFrom left to right you have:\nChicken Tikka Masala\nNight Rise Breakfast Bread\nMinced Meat Pie+ (includes base recipes for 2 variants of minced meat sauce and pie dough, and 2 more pie recipes as alternative routes thru the flowchart)\nMacaroni & Cheese (includes base recipe for Cheese sauce in-line)\nThai yellow curry\nShipping\nThe digital only reward tiers are available worldwide.\nFor the physical rewards I offer shipping to the following countries and regions, originating from Sweden. All fees are including any import duties and taxes.\nNote: Currency conversions shown here are a rough estimate. Kickstarter will show you an updated price based on the currency conversion applicable when you make your pledge.\n\n\nTime Plan\nThe Kickstarter campaign is projected to start when the book content draft is completed. That means that the majority of the work should already be finished. The final layout draft for the book will be completed around the time the kickstarter campaign itself finish. Then a print proof and extensive review will be performed before the book is printed and finally shipped.\nThe eBook and digitial posters will be sent out as soon as the pledges are processed.\nThe physical book and posters will be shipped no later than February 2021. This includes a buffer for unforeseen events delaying the process (see risks chapter), so there is a good change the physical rewards are shipped earlier.\nBudget\nThe majority of the budget goes to the printing of the book. The project goal is set to break-even level, meaning that if the project is funded 100%, the profit margin is essentially zero.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRisk to Project Fulfilment:\n\nI can not mention risks without mentioning COVID-19. I am 39 years old so I believe the risk of me not being able to complete the book is small. There is obviously a small risk that I might get sick for an extended period of time or I may need to care for family members which could lead to delays (see below), but other than that I strongly believe the project will be completed and rewards will be shipped.\n\nRisk to Project Time Plan (delays):\n\nAll risks below are preemptively mitigated by including a buffer in the time plan.\n\n- There is a small risk that an extended period of sickness (COVID-19) might affect the time plan.\n- Delays from printing. The print shop has a policy to fulfil their duties within 15 business days, but you never know. I will print a print proof to check the colour gamut and check for any layout issues. This add up to 3 weeks to the process but I think it is worth it for a quality end product. In the worst case scenario this need to be repeated one more time, which is accounted for in the time plan.\n- If there is a bigger demand than anticipated, the logistics of packaging and shipping the rewards might take longer than planned. I am doing everything on my own, but I have family members who could potentially be recruited if the task become overwhelming.\n\nRisks and time plan need to be reviewed continuously thru the project. My experience is that there is always some unforeseen road blocks along the way, but I know we can get thru all of them eventually. I plan to be transparent and keep backers updated on any project status changes and the projected shipping date.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge SEK 50 or more", "title": "Digital poster", "descp": "Get a Digital Poster of one of the flowchart recipes which you can print for personal use up to A3 size.

This official cookbook draws inspiration from the classic ToeJam & Earl video game series as well as real world foods and flavors. You don't have to be a fan of the series to get behind this cookbook. Just like the game series it's based on, Funky Fresh Foods is designed for beginners and pros alike. You don't have to be familiar with the series to jump in and enjoy the recipes in this cookbook! There is something for everyone in this book. It's weird, it's alien, it's interesting! \u2604\ufe0f\nPlease don't ask me how they\u2019re floating, I don't know. I just get paid to put the photos on the page.\nFunky Fresh Foods of Funkotron tells the story of how the groovy extraterrestrial duo, ToeJam and Earl, embark on an epic quest from the Funkapotamus himself to bring new tastes, interstellar peace, and funky, fresh flavors to planet Earth. This cookbook is chock full of classic dishes re-imagined with a vibrant, otherworldly vibe. How about a funky beat cake made with real beets? Would you try some Tomato Jam and Earl Grey shortbread cookies (a specialty of Mama Flo)? Oh, maybe Big Earl will finally share the secret recipe behind his world famous hot dog! Sounds weird, looks weirder, but all tastes amazing. Funky Fresh Foods will teach you to prepare meals that will take your taste buds to the moon and back. \ud83d\ude80\nFun recipes to try at home with friends and family.\nFlamingo not included.\nToeJam & Earl is all about fun and trying out new things, just like our recipes! The series has always been about bringing people together and showing them new cultures and ideas with excitement, mystery, and imagination. This cookbook continues that tradition. We won't just show you new recipes, we'll also teach you a lot about how to cook and how much fun it can be. This isn't the first time we've made a cookbook either. Members of the team behind this cookbook have previously worked on two incredible culinary projects that were both major successes: Mother's Cookbook and The Legend's Cookbook. With all that experience and a brand new intergalactic setting, we\u2019ll expand your mind and taste buds with far out dishes that will change the way you think about yourself, the universe, and food. \ud83d\udef8\nIf you're not familiar with the ToeJam & Earl series, that's ok! We'll give you a super quick rundown. The series debuted on the SEGA Genesis / Mega Drive back in 1991 and was a cult hit with three more entries made since then. The newest game, ToeJam & Earl: Back in the Groove, released in 2019 on Steam, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.  The games star intergalactic alien rappers, ToeJam (the red one) and Earl (the yellow one), who crash their ship on our planet. Not only do they make a mess, they also run around collecting the parts of their ship, getting into trouble, and eating everything they can get their hands on (even though sometimes they probably shouldn't eat that moldy bread). The gameplay is fun and fast-paced with an emphasis on randomly generated levels, a funk-inspired soundtrack, and a healthy dose of 90's nostalgia. You don't have to be a TJ&E fan to enjoy this cookbook, but if this cookbook has piqued your interest, check out the games. They're a lot of fun. \ud83d\ude42\n\n\nNow that we've covered the source material, we can talk about the book more! ToeJam & Earl\u2019s Funky Fresh Foods of Funkotron will be available in digital, paperback, and hardcover formats so you can choose (I always opt for the hardcover because I always get too much butter on my fingers to use my tablet). The book will be 8\" x 10\" (20.3cm x 25.4cm) and contain over 100 pages of funktastic photos, art, and recipes. You'll find over 44 original recipes (with the possibility of more with stretch goals \ud83d\ude09). This is a quality-made book too, unlike certain spaceships. It\u2019ll hold up to kitchen use with a strong smyth sewn binding, deliciously heavyweight internal paper stock (makes the pages sauce-resistant), and a hardy matte laminate cover to keep the stains away. \ud83d\udcaa\nOk, I actually kind of want carpet with this pattern on it.\nFood has been a longtime staple in all manner of video games. The ToeJam & Earl series is no exception to that. The dynamic duo have been running around and chowing down on all kinds of comfort food ever since the first game. As a kid, I always wondered what an alien's take on pizza or ice cream would be and now I finally have the opportunity to show everybody! I also figured aliens probably ate a little bit healthier than most Earthlings, part of being an advanced civilization and such. With that in mind, this cookbook will heavily feature healthy recipes and vegetarian options and won\u2019t contain any recipes that have red meat (then what\u2019s in Earl\u2019s hot dog??? Guess you'll have to back it to find out.) Here's a link to seven sample recipes! Not to mention, the food in our cookbook looks absolutely out-of-this-world and we know you'll want to show it off on social media. Hopefully it'll inspire some of your friends to try out some of our nutritious nosh. That being said, we want you all to live long and prosper. \ud83d\udd96\nThe book is full of bright art, funky designs, and more, just like the game!\n\nHi! My name is June Kirsch and I'll be your fresh chef today on this funky adventure of a cookbook. I have been cooking forever. I just love it. I went to the Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park, New York and graduated in 2016 with a degree in Culinary Arts and Applied Food Studies. Or, as I like to call, \"How to Make Food and How to Make it Good\". \nShe's the best chef I've ever met, she's also the only chef... I don't get out much.\nMy philosophy about cooking has always been about bringing people together. Meals are best shared and sometimes even if you can't be in the same room as someone, you can share a recipe with them and be a part of their life. I was born in Kenya and spent most of my childhood moving all over the planet, but we always made a point to share our meals together. It brought us together no matter the distance.\nI learned a lot about cooking from all of my travels and my experience in culinary school but the best place to learn how to cook is your own kitchen. ToeJam & Earl resonates with me because they came to a new place, tried different things, and went outside their comfort zone, and these are all things I'm hoping to bring to this cookbook! I'm happy to be your pilot and I hope we don't crash land, but even if we do, I'm sure we'll have a great time making all manner of Funky Fresh Foods!\nBig Earl ain't afraid of cooking bacon without a shirt on.\nWe\u2019ve been working on this cookbook for quite a while! We started cooking almost a year ago, coinciding with the release of ToeJam & Earl: Back in the Groove.  A few of them have been tweaked a little since then, but you should check out our awesomely funky cooking videos. \ud83c\udfa5\nPLAY\n\nPLAY\n\nOur plan is to wrap up our taste testing and finalize our recipes. We\u2019ve been at it a while so that\u2019s nearly done. Then we finish up all our art and photos. Then we get the books printed and shipped out to all you hungry backers. \ud83e\udd61\nA little preview of what's in the book.\nI'm quite partial to the Moldy Bread personally.\nYes, I own that many pairs of scissors. I do a lot of scrap-booking.\nPLAY\n\nDesign and blurb on the back of the book not final!\nSo cute!\nSafety scissorsnot guaranteed!\nA little preview of what's inside! Except Riley, he's too cute, I just had to sneak him in.\nWe have a few unlockable recipes waiting for only the funkiest of funklords. We're talking, of course, about our new Community Challenges!

From a personal desire to make something for this somewhat incohesive, beautiful fandom, I (Louise Leung/ Potentialforart/ Izu) wanted to organize a fun project that people would be able to enjoy and provide a book that artists and others would be able to hold in their hands. It exists as a series that alternates between physical, curated books, and digital, all-inclusive books, giving the opportunity to be published to everyone and anyone who wants to be. Since our initial start, we've covered many themes: Food/Utensils, Spooky, Flora and Fungi, Superstitions, Science and Technology, and now Celestial Bodies. \nYou can see the previous books on Gumroad by clicking this image!\nThe 2021 Edition of the Object Head Zine centers around Celestial Bodies: Space and Angels. This book is a collection of illustrations and comics produced by 51 different artists put together in a 6\"x9\", 144 pages, perfect bound, soft cover with a rainbow shimmer effect. Artists for the book are paid a base page rate of $100 CAD/$80 USD per page (depending on the currency exchange). I pay this amount out of pocket and as an independent artist with a full-time job, I wish I could afford more. With this Kickstarter, I would like to give the artists of this edition the opportunity to earn more per page. \nThe following artists are featured in this edition of the Zine:\nPotentialforart \u2727 Derek Hetrick \u2727 Blacklimes \u2727 Cacoethic+Lenalis \u2727 Inktrashing \u2727 Louise Kay Uy \u2727 Juliette GMM L\u00f3pez \u2727 Autumn Haynes \u2727 Coey Kuhn \u2727 CORVIDAY \u2727 theHoleyness \u2727 Kimberly Wang \u2727 Nelnal \u2727 Chan Chau \u2727 Nicolas Ky \u2727 Hannako Lambert \u2727 CosmicSynapse \u2727 Sf\u00e9 R.

Using this service, all packages will have a tracking number given to the customer when the products are ready to be delivered and should be overall cheaper to ship out to customers both domestic and internationally.\n White Squirrel is a USA based, small company that works alongside creators to help distribute their products to their customer base. Run by Andrea and Sasha, they will be responsible for making sure all packages have the correct merchandise and sending them out on a prompt schedule.  To date, they've successfully mailed out over 32,000 packages and have worked (and are currently working with) 60+ projects and 40 creators.\nSince the main purpose of this Kickstarter is to earn more money for our artists, the stretch goals are made to reflect that:\n$12650: Artists will receive another additional $25 pay increase, totallying $75 pay increase to their page rate.\n$15000: Artists will receive another additional $50 pay increase, totaling $100 pay increase to their page rate. \nThis timeline is approximate due to many uncertainties currently going on: global pandemic, political strife, delayed postal services. If everything went smoothly and there were only a few delays, this would be the ideal timeline:\n Early-Mid November: Start the Kickstarter, I will order the books and remaining, less time-sensitive merchandise when I have a good sense of the numbers needed to fulfill the KS order. \n Late November/December: Kickstarter finishes funding, I will send out the artists' additional payment once the money is cleared with Kickstarter and the bank. I will use the remaining money for shipping products to White Squirrel. Hopefully, receive all the merchandise needed. \n  Mid December - January: Hopefully receive books, start drawing in them.\n February: Finish drawing in books. Send books and merchandise out to White Squirrel\n March: White Squirrel receives the books and merchandise and can start sorting and mailing things out. \n Possibly Late March - Mid April: Everything is completed, leftover books will be sold at the Gumroad store\nAgain, this is the ideal timeline and everything is very much subject to unpredictable delays and unforeseen circumstances. We will notify everyone through updates should any issues arise but we're hoping we can stick to this schedule, the world permitting.\n Project Lead: Potentialforart/Louise Leung\n Kickstarter Manager: Mia \"Hye\" Mardikian\n Kickstarter Video Creator: Iris Jay", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is my seventh year producing the Object Head Zine and I've made tens of other zines, both physically and digitally so I am well versed in reaching deadlines and foreseeing possible delays. However, due to the global climate we live in (closed borders, pandemic, political strife), there may be possible delays in the production of materials (separate from the Kickstarter timeline), and shipping to customers.

Don't try to get too close to him or you're going to get burned. See, Liam has a terrible secret he can't share with his friends until\u2026 a series of unfortunate events occur, shattering his world. Enter Nathanael: tall, charming, unexpected. He will soon take a great place in Liam's life. But dark forces are threatening the fate of multiple universes, more powerful than any of them could have ever imagined. Nothing will ever be the same. Wait. And who are the Twin Kings already?\n\nPhil Briones can do it all!\nYou still don't know Phil? Time to catch up, folks! Though he's mostly known to American audiences as an artist, this is not his first rodeo as a writer and color artist.  Phil Briones has enjoyed a successful career in animation (at Disney, working on movies such as Tarzan, Hercules, The Emperor's New Groove or A Goofy Movie), before transitioning to comics, first in his home country, France, then in the United States.\n\n                   His body of work includes: \nSome of Phil Briones' works for Disney, Soleil, Ankama, Marvel, DC or Humanoids.\n\nIN THE USA\nWhite Tiger (Marvel)\nCaptain America (Marvel)\nX-Men (Marvel)\nIron Man vs Whiplash (Marvel)\nAmerican Son (Marvel)\nSuicide Squad (DC)\nDetective Comics (DC)\nKatana (DC)\nAquaman Rebirth (DC)\nIgnited (Humanoids)\n IN FRANCE \nLa Geste des Chevaliers Dragon (Soleil)   \n Wanderers w/Chris Claremont (Soleil/Panini)     \nGeek Agency (Ankama)\n 7 H\u00e9ros (Delcourt)\nVikings & Sir\u00e8nes (Humanoides Associ\u00e9s) \nNow, with Twin Kings' Battle, Phil delivers his most ambitious and personal work to date. His first ever full creator owned series. And FairSquare Comics couldn't be prouder to partner with him for this project.  \nPhil at work in his home studio\n\n\nThe real deal\nTwin Kings's Battle is a sentimental queer multi-layered drama fueled by supernatural and mystical elements. A story inspired by the best Asian romance tales of all mediums (manga/manhwa, TV series, literature). Our heroes' larger than life adventures won't leave you stone cold. Just like in any traditional \"boys love\" or \"bromance\" stories, emotions are the seeds of this graphic novel. But thanks to the powerful expressive art of Phil Briones, these elements are taken to the next level! \nIf you ever seen Chinese hit series The Untamed, you will absolutely LOVE Twin Kings' Battle. \n\nWait\u2026 What if I'm not Queer? Can I still be interested?\nAB-SO-LU-TELY! Love is Love. And Twin Kings' Battle is not a gay centric story. It's mainly a story about love, friendship and what's our place in this universe (also with cool Dragons, swords, magical mysteries and humor). Whether you're a member of the LGBTQ+ community or not, you can fully enjoy this story. Twin King Battle is first and foremost about love and friendship, feelings that all of us can connect to. You'll LOVE this graphic novel. Oh, and don't be afraid to bring tissue\u2026 We're not going to spoil you the end of the first volume, but it's intense. \nCharacters. Characters. Characters.\nWhat sets Twin Kings' Battle apart from other graphic novels is the special tender love and care Phil Briones put in the creation of the main characters. Let's introduce them to you:\nLiam Peters is a shy boy who comes from the Other Realm. A place where Dragons and Wizards are ruling with an iron fist, where magic is science.  When our story opens, Liam lives in his own mind. He lives almost alone. His only two friends are Neal and Amy. Most of his time, Liam spends it playing an online game he mastered to perfection: Twin Kings' Battle. He's so good at it that it made him some kind of celebrity. He has enough money from tournaments to pay for all his expenses and tuition. What's this game all about? Liam feels connected to it like he was living it. \nNeal Tycoon is Liam's best friend. He's kinda insecure at times being short and looking younger than he is. He sees Liam as the big brother he never had, though they're the same age. Liam really like Neal too even though he's not always showing it. The fact that he also bears a strange ressemblance with Liam's dearly departed brother doesn't help\u2026\nAmy Stephenson is clueless about Liam's past life. Our hero has been living with the Stephensons for a while but a lot has been left unsaid between him and Amy. In fact, the two youngsters couldn't be more different. She's as much and extrovert as he is an introvert. She likes Liam but can't also help to think that him coming to her family changed everything, and not always for the better. In spite all that, they were able to create a unique bonding. Amy lights up the room when she arrives and Liam grew to love that about her. The two are also passionate about the Twin Kings' universe, although Amy is more attracted by the novels than the video games.  \nNathanael Binger just arrived in town and on the campus. He's rich, handsome, nice, in shape. Nathanael is the star of a web series that's hugely popular with teenagers . And on top of that, he's modeling. This guy has it all! (don't we hate that?). Befriend him and you'll have the impression that you're someone very important. He's never too far from Liam and you could tell that he's genuinely intrigued by this mysterious young man. He's sure Liam is living a double life and he wants to know everything about it! Friend or foe? White knight or manipulator? What if Nathanael and Liam hadn't been brought to the same campus by accident?\n\nThe Graphic Novel and the FairSquare Comics Experience\nThis graphic novel is unique. Phil is of course quite unique. But FairSquare Comics is a publisher unlike any other. We don't just publish comics and graphic novels for the sake of publishing them. Every book is special. Since the company was founded, in 2019, we committed to releasing graphic novels that wouldn't even been considered elsewhere. Graphic novels from under represented and overlooked creators: Immigrants (like Fabrice Sapolsky, the publisher/Editor). Other minorities like creators from the Noir Is the New Black anthology or co-editor TC Harris. Queer creators and many more! We call it \"Comics For The Rest of Us\". \nSure, other publishers will promote diversity and that\u2019s awesome (the more, the better). But at FairSquare Comics, it\u2019s in our DNA. We offer competitive deals to our creators in which they keep 100% of their rights. They are also fairly compensated for their work because creating comics is not a hobby, it\u2019s a real job!\nBy supporting our books such as One-Hit Wonder, Noir Is the New Black, Twin Kings\u2019 Battle and all the incredible graphic novels to come, you\u2019re not simply supporting talent. We believe that if we can all buy organic groceries and support fair trade, we can all support creators and their graphic novels!\nSpeaking of which, Twin Kings' Battle Vol. 1 will be a 144 pages premium graphic novel:  80 lbs matte interior stock, 130 lbs soft touch cover stock. Square bound and sent in a special protective sleeve to avoid damages. Yes, we care. \nSome of the packages include dust jacket variants. There will be four different dust variants: one from Phil Briones, one from Yanick Paquette, one from xxxxxxx (to be announced) and a retailer exclusive variant by Jim Cheung. How cool is that?\n\nSome really cool rewards\u2026\nHere's what you can get with the Twin Kings' Battle rewards:", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs with every project, there's a risk. And Kickstarter seems to be like the El Dorado right now. \nBut even though our timelines are filled with outstanding successes in the crowdfunding department, let's not forget that Kickstarter is an \"all or nothing\" kind of deal. If we don't get to our initial goal, we get nothing. So please, support us. Pledge. Share. Be our cheerleader. We need you. \n\nIndependent comics can't exist without YOU. Independent creators can't deliver the best stories without any kind of interference without you.

Each card will be composed of an illustration and its name in english, with as reference the divinatory Tarot of Marseille. You will find a more detailed presentation of the cards in the ARCANA section of this page.\nThe format chosen for this tarot inspired by the Cthulhu Mythos (3.35\" x 6.50\"  | 85\u00d7165 mm) is much larger than the usual divinatory tarot decks, including the Tarot of Marseille. This format is close to one of the oldest tarot decks, the \"Visconti-Sforza\" created by the artist Bonifacio Bembo between 1428 and 1447. \nGiven the large size of the cards, we have chosen a rather important weight (315 gr) which combines flexibility and rigidity. The R'lyeh edition silkscreen deck is printed on an OldMill Avorio paper (350 gr), which has a light cream tint, with a black silkscreen ink which allows a very deep rendering.\nAll decks will be delivered with a 64-page booklet (2,95\" x 5,90\" | 75x150 mm), printed in black and white (32 pages in English, 32 pages in French) that will help you with the interpretation of each card.\nThe Miskatonic and R'lyeh pledge tiers will also include Kickstarter exclusive components:\n 160-page softcover book,\nA black cotton drawstring bag (6.1\" x 8.2\" | 15,5x21 cm) with a red silkscreen print to store your deck,\n A magnetic box with hot stamping metal print,\n 14 Fine Arts, printed in color on fine paper (6.1\" x 8.2\" | 26x14 cm),\n 4 enamel Pins (size: 4,5 cm | 1.77\"), featuring the 4 emblems of our Minor Arcana,\nA limited edition of a 79-cards silk-screen printed deck (only in the R'lyeh edition). \nThe softcover book is bigger and larger (4.8\" x 6.2\" | 12,2x15,7 cm) than the booklet included with the Deck. Its content is also very different: the  whole story of Isaac Jefferson's researches, interpretive poems, the iconography of each card fully explained as well as their links with the Myth. The book interior design is inspired from ancient books, illustrated with engravings and printed in two colors, black and a red pantone.\nThe soft-covered book will be available in English and French. You will be able select the language in the Pledge Manager after the campaign.\nThis is the standard Cthulhu Dark Arts Tarot deck. It will include:\n All 78 Tarot Cards + 1 Isaac Jefferson card printed in color,\n All Cards are improved with poker varnish,\nAll Cards are improved with black core quality,\nAll Cards are gilded with gold edges,\nA 64-page booklet printed in black and white (32 pages in English and 32 pages in French. Size: 2,95\" x 5,90\" | 7,5x15 cm). This booklet will explain the symbolic meaning of each card,\nPDF version of the booklet,\nAll these elements are packed in a tuck box finished with mat lamination.\nThe Miskatonic Pledge Tier will include all the rewards of the Innsmouth pledge Tier, plus Kickstarter exclusive elements:\n 160-page softcover book (4.8\" x 6.2\" | 12,2x15,7 cm) containing more illustrations, texts and poems related to the Tarot deck and its story,\n 14 Fine Arts, printed in color on fine paper (6.1\" x 8.2\" | 26x14 cm),\n 4 enamel Pins (size: 4,5 cm | 1.77\"), featuring the 4 emblems of our Minor Arcana,\nA black cotton drawstring bag (6.1\" x 8.2\" | 15,5x21 cm) with a red silk-screen print to store your deck when you are on the road,\nA beautiful magnetic box with hot stamping metal print to store all the material of this edition.  \nThe R'lyeh Pledge Tier will include all the rewards of the Miskatonic Pledge Tier, plus:\n An extraspecial edition of the 79-cards deck, black silk-screen printed (Kickstarter exclusive),\nThis extra deck is packaged in its own tuck box,\nThe tray of the magnetic box will be adapted to contain this extra deck.\nThese extra cards will be silk-screen printed and hand crafted by \"L'Atelier du Grand Chic\", a French well known screen printer. The paper chosen by the artists and the craftsman is an Old Mill Avorio 350 gr, slightly tinted with a cream color and a sensitive grain.\nThe silk-print is a stencil based technic. It allows very intense color combined with a good opacity. This edition is very limited as it requires a lot of artistic and handmade work. The final rendering will be unique for each card!\nYou can get additional copies of the Innsmouth or Miskatonic editions by adding them to your pledge trough the add-ons section accessible by clicking on \u201cManage you pledge\u201d button (explanation above).

But man should not laugh, for he ignores the reason of this mad convulsive flight; he ignores what the moth so desperately tries to flee, that which lies in the dark recesses of the world, betwixt the very fabric of time and space or the eldritch depths of our primitive consciousness\u2026\nOne man knows. One man has been moth and flame, darkness and light and one man has learned their secrets, all their atavic mysteries engraved on a series of cards one millenium ago by a mad monk, a legacy of pain and dark epiphanies spawned in the roiling cosmos of long-dead corpse-stars. This man is Isaac S. Jefferson. And now this man wants you to inherit this burning and burderning knowledge.\nWill you heed his call? Will you dare to delve into\u2026 the Cthulhu Dark Arts Tarot?\nThe illustrations of the Cthulhu Dark Arts Tarot were made by F\u00f8rtifem. First entirely drawn by hand, each illustration was scanned and then colored using a computer. To ensure that the finished product would honor the quality of the illustrations as well as the greatness of the Cthulhu Mythos, we decided to print them on large cards (3.35\" x 6.50\" / 8,5\u00d716,5 cm) on high quality paper (315 gr). The limited R'lyeh edition offers you a second deck, silkscreen printed in black.\nThis tarot contains the 22 major arcana present in the Tarot de Marseille. Each major arcana is composed of an illustration, a number and a name. You will find below a presentation of some major arcana taken from the game :\nEach four figures is unique and pays homage to the universe of the Cthulhu Mythos. In each series, each face corresponds to an eldritch evolution of the previous one. Thus, the 4 figures placed side by side form a continuous illustration. Below, a representation of the faces of the suite of Pentacles and the suite of Cups.\nCthulhu Dark Arts Tarot contains 56 minor arcana, which include the numbers of the traditional tarot cards (Cups, Wands, Swords, Pentacles), while proposing illustrations reinterpreting them in the universe of Cthulhu. Contrary to the Rider-Waite Smith Tarot, the minor arcana - excluding figures - do not offer illustrations or characters, but rather a set of unique combinations of the tarot symbols: Cups, Wands, Swords... and Pentacles!\nThis deck was mainly created for the divination practice. The major and minor arcana correspond to those of the Tarot de Marseille, and you can use the Cthulhu Dark Arts Tarot in exactly the same way. All decks will be delivered with a 64-page booklet (32 pages in English, 32 pages in French) that will help you with the interpretation of each card.\nThe Miskatonic and R'lyeh editions will also include a 160-page softcover booklet. It contains information, from Isaac Jefferson's research, on how to interpret each card, with an interpretive poem, explanations on the iconography of the card.\nBeyond divination, it is possible to use this deck in the practice of role-playing games of various types: tabletop role-playing in a universe similar to Cthulhu, LARP, murder party... Be creative, in order to add in your games elements of atmosphere allowing to immerse a little more your players in the horrific universe of Cthulhu.\nOn Facebook\nOn Instagram\nOn Twitter\nSign up for our newsletter\nCongratulation!

Passionate about imaginary cultures, we attach great importance and respect to the works created by H.P. Lovecraft, as well as to the works that helped develop the myth of Cthulhu. However, we also consider that this author\u2019s views on race have no place in today\u2019s society. We absolutely do not share these beliefs, and we have worked hard to recontextualize his creations to create an inclusive, fair and respectful project, consistent with our modern values.\nWe decided to present our projet on Kickstarter for two reasons. The first one is our will to reach the largest audience, to touch Cthulhu Mythos fans and tarot lovers around the world. But how to do this from Paris? Even for an established publisher in France, going international is a long road and we quickly found out that we had to break beyond the traditional channels. The second reason that convinced us, was the situation of our domestic market. Tarot decks you can find in French stores are very traditional and the usual actors of our market weren't ready yet to distribute a complete fancy and stylish tarot based on an imaginary world, even if this universe is called Cthulhu Mythos. It means that we definitively had to go online to offer this Tarot deck... And what better solution than Kickstarter, the world's largest funding platform for creative projects?\nWe are using local partners with logistic hubs in the European Union (Meeple Logistics), USA and Canada (Quartermaster Logistics), and Asia (VFI Asia), and we will also provide shipping for United Kingdom that is as friendly as possible. \nBackers will therefore benefit from optimized shipping costs and they won\u2019t pay customs at package delivery as it is sent from their home country.\nThrough the pledge manager tool, after the campaign, backers will pay an amount corresponding to the shipping costs between the hub and their home. We take in charge transport to the hubs and potential custom fees.\nBelow are the current shipping estimates. Note that these are estimates as of late October 2020, so there might be slight variations on the actual shipping costs at fulfillment.\n * At the time of the campaign, we do not have all the relevant information on how Brexit will affect our shipping plans. Be sure that we will do everything we can to provide you with friendly shipping costs to the United Kingdom.\nAdrien Havet and Jesse Daubertes both started their careers as graphic designers, before devoting themselves as a duo to their shared love for illustrations, under one name.\nSince 2012, they have developed a four handed style that borrows from the strength of tattoo lines as well as from the meticulousness of old engravings.\nSwinging between dark and ultra colorful atmospheres, occultism and pop culture, they don't know how to do anything else but drawing, so they try to do it well.\nLovers of extreme musics, they share their time between creating visuals for bands (Rammstein, Slipknot, Trivium, Emperor, Alcest, Carpenter Brut...) but also for books and brands (HBO, Ubisoft, Cartier, Affligem, Le Monde...).\nTheir personal drawings have been exhibited in Paris, Los Angeles, and Hong Kong.

Once its victim is hooked, the translatoria unfolds its long stinger to suck out of the writer's brain the ink it needs to survive, which it then spews back into another language. As of now, Maxime has had the honour of digesting the cerebral secretions of many wonderful artists, such as H.P. Lovecraft, Anthony Ryan, Joe Hill or Lewis Carroll. When saturated with ideas, the translatoria editorialis can enter a chrysalis state that enables it to autonomously excrete words and become itself an author. Maxime Le Dain currently lives in its nest in the French countryside, with its mate, two adorable pupae and three cats.\nFounded in 2000, Bragelonne is the curious story of a bunch of friends who, rich of nothing but their passion for the genre, became in just a handful of years the first independent publishers of fantasy fiction books in French language.\nToday, Bragelonne is referring more than 550 authors from all over the world and has published close to 6 000 titles, to form the most complete and diversified catalogue for fantasy fans of all ages with names such as David Gemmell, Raymond Feist, Pat Rothfuss, Peter Brett, Scott Lynch, Andrzej Sapkowski (The Witcher), Peter F.

As rookies, we knew that we needed support to propose a well-builded campaign and answer to backers expectations. That's why we decided to teamed with veterans as The Crowdfunding Agency who provide us great help and advises in this exciting first project. \n\nAs leader in imaginary culture in our country we have a good knowledge of Cthulhu Mythos and H.P. Lovecraft works. We spent several months to build this project with Maxime Le Dain, a specialist in France who translated a lot of Lovecraftian stories to French. He had the hard task to imagine all arcana and link them to the Myth, wrote all their background and Isaac Jefferson story. The next step was to find a talented illustrator, able to mix and master ancient and modern styles and understand how deep is the Myth. We found this real gem with F\u00f8rtifem who already had blown our mind with their several work for music industry. They are hard-workers and at the launch of this campaign, all cards, illustrations and colors, are finished and ready to print!\n\n Also as established publisher in France we have a good knowledge in printing games and books.

My name is Jeana and this is my fourth Kickstarter Campaign! I recently designed a collection of aesthetic whale enamel pins that I hope to turn into crewnecks, lanyards, stickers and more! I\u2019m very excited to run this Kickstarter and I hope you\u2019ll enjoy them as well!\nMy previous Kickstarters were great successes with over CA$ 50,000 total pledged. Now, this new project will not only feature enamel pins and stickers, but also embroidered crewnecks, lanyards and washi tapes! However, I can't do so without your help. Supporting me through this Kickstarter will not only see these products be brought to life, but will also give you a greater discount! Any left over products will retail in my shop at a higher price.\nKickstarter has a pledge now and pay later mechanism, so that you will not be charged for your pledge until the end of the campaign and only if the initial goal is met. You can upgrade, downgrade, or cancel your pledge at any time before the campaign ends! Surveys will be sent at the end of the campaign through BackerKit to collect addresses and choose rewards.\nFor updates, future product designs, and more of my artwork and merchandise, check out my Shop and Instagram! Have a question? Check out the FAQs section of this campaign and if your question has not been answered, contact me via direct messages here or email me at jeanadraws@gmail.com\nScroll to the bottom of the page for more model photos!\n Please note that in the sample crewnecks, the sleeve was 1\" longer. This will be adjusted to the new length in the size chart during mass production as the sleeves were too long in the samples. Sleeve designs will be mirrored on both sleeves (like the wave whale sample) and this will be adjusted during mass production for the sakura and dream whale crewnecks.\nLanyard samples\nEach design set features an enamel pin, lanyard, vinyl sticker, and embroidered crewneck! The entire collection of products will unlock all at once as soon as the funding goal is met! The initial goal of CAD $2100 will go towards unlocking the Sakura Whale collection. Additional design collections are unlockable as stretch goals!\nEach collection depicted above is also an overview to what is included in each bundle!\nAs a thank you for being a kickstarter backer and helping me bring this collection to life, I've decided to add a few freebies for you guys!\nIf you want to pledge for multiple different items, please pledge for the reward tier of the highest priced item, then increase the pledge amount by the cost of the additional items. \n Please make sure you add your add-ons using the CAD prices! USD prices are just listed for reference. If you need any help with the calculations, don't hesitate to send me a message here and I'll gladly help you calculate your total :)\n\u2605 Please do NOT include any shipping costs in your pledge amount! Shipping costs will be calculated and charged via BackerKit after the campaign ends! \u2605\nTo change your pledge tier, click the the \"Manage Your Pledge\" button (at the top of the campaign page or by clicking your current reward tier). Then click the \"Change your pledge\" button and select \"New reward tier\".\nTo change your pledge amount, click the the \"Manage Your Pledge\" button (at the top of the campaign page or by clicking your current reward tier). Then click the \"Change your pledge\" button. Add your add-on total to the current pledge amount and it will update!\nPlease note that the above shipping prices are rough estimate and may be subject to change or fluctuate slightly, thank you for understanding! Shipping will be calculated based on your country and the weight of your package through BackerKit and you will be charged after the campaign is over.\nCrewnecks/bundles will be packaged and shipped in a polybag (or box depending on number of crewnecks) via USPS Priority Mail (1-3 days), which also includes tracking.\nPin/lanyard/washi tape only orders will be packaged in a bubble mailer envelope and sent out via USPS First Class (3-5 days) and includes tracking. \nSticker only orders will be shipped in a non-tracked envelope as letter mail.\nFor international backers, please note that you'll be responsible for any customs/VAT fees that may incur. It is illegal for me to change the price or mark the items as gifts on customs forms. If you do not accept the package and it is returned to me undamaged, I can refund you the costs minus shipping.\nDue to the ongoing pandemic, shipping times cannot be 100% guaranteed, especially for international packages as many countries are experiencing a backlog and delay in accepting and delivering packages. Please ensure that your country is accepting packages around the time the products will be shipped! If you would like me to hold the package for you to be shipped at a later time, please let me know ASAP.\n This campaign will run for 3 weeks, after which there will be an additional 2-week period before I receive the funds from Kickstarter. Once the campaign is over, I'll send out surveys through BackerKit for everyone to choose their products and fill out shipping addresses. You'll have one week to fill out the survey and during this one week waiting period, the BackerKit preorder shop will also be available to everyone!\nOnce everyone has filled out the survey and I have a final count on the quantities I need to order, production for all the products will begin! Crewneck production should take less than 2 months, factoring shipping time to me, I expect to receive them in February. Once I receive everything, I'll quality check, package, and start shipping everything out to you guys! Current estimated delivery is March to early April!\nEnamel pins, lanyards, washi tapes, and stickers may take less time to produce than the crewnecks so backers who only backed for those items may receive their packages earlier.\nPlease note that this is just a rough estimate of the timeline and that exact times may vary depending on number of backers, external situations and holidays, etc.\n\u2605 Early bird spots are limited to the first 48 hours, once you miss it, there will be no way of getting a spot again. If you un-pledge during the campaign you will not be able to re-pledge for early bird deals, even if someone else drops!\n\u2605 When you pledge on Kickstarter, you'll not be charged right away, so that you will not be charged for your pledge until the end of the campaign and only if the initial goal is met. If the campaign is unsuccessful, you will not be charged at all. You can upgrade, downgrade, or cancel your pledge at any time before the campaign ends!\n\u2605 Your pledges helps to unlock new designs, so even if the design that you like is still locked, your pledge can bring us one step closer to unlocking it. Please pledge for ALL of the items you'd like, even if they aren't unlocked yet! It helps us reach the next goal!\n\u2605 You can choose which product(s) you would like at the end of the campaign, after which I'll send out a BackerKit survey to collect your shipping address and the specific rewards you want to choose\n\u2605 Shipping is NOT included in the tier pricing! Shipping will be calculated and charged via BackerKit AFTER the campaign is over based on the weight of your package and your country. Please do not add any shipping costs to your pledge! Please see the shipping costs chart for an estimate of the shipping costs!\n\u2605 If you have any more questions, please don't hesitate to leave a comment, or you can email me at jeanadraws@gmail.com\nSee more of my products at www.jeanadraws.com!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI've had experience running multiple kickstarter campaigns and have made various kinds of products including over 30 pin designs, keychains, washi tapes, lanyards, and more. I have reliable manufacturers for all my products that I use to ensure a smooth production process and quality products for you all.\n\nSamples have been made for all three crewneck designs and will be made for the lanyards too before mass production to ensure the standard of quality. However, there still might be delays during production due to unforeseeable circumstances or slight alterations in color, size and design of the final production. These shall be minimal and not affect the overall appearance of the products. If the products must be remade, there will be a delay in shipping time. I will continue communicating with my manus and update you all on the process as we go along!\n\nWith the current COVID-19 pandemic, there is also a risk of your country not accepting packages if you're international and delayed shipping times (both domestic and international). In the case your country is not accepting packages when the products are ready to be shipped, I can hold the package until your country accepts packages again.\n\nNote that refunds will not be issued under any circumstances once production has begun, as the funds go directly into production. By pledging, you understand and are willing to pay for both the items you pledge for and the subsequent shipping fees charged via BackerKit.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge CA$ 5 or more", "title": "\u2605 Sticker \u2605", "descp": "!!

My name is Rozenn, and I'm an illustrator from Lyon, France. I'm very excited to finally share this project with you!  \nI have created a hand-painted Lenormand deck inspired by my deep love of nature and animals. Lenormand is a specific type of cartomancy, similar but different to the tarot you probably know from the Rider-Waite-Smith deck. While RWS has dense symbology and mysticism, Lenormand is more personal, direct, and simplistic. It feels almost conversational, and better suited for daily life. \nThe Magpie's Lenormand is a 36-card deck printed on 400gsm art paper with matte finish. The cards are standard tarot size (4.72*2.75 in // 12*7 cm).\nThe deck features the complete set of 36 Lenormand cards, illustrated traditionally with ink paintings.\nThe back of the cards\nThe cards have metallic blue edge gilding\nWith many cards, the subject is a simple concept (example: The Dog, The Rider, The Clouds) that may feel similar to an Oracle deck, for those familiar with the idea. The deck has a very natural theme, focusing on plants and animals and insects. As such, the cards have been interpreted to fit, such as The House depicted as a gold-tinged beehive.\nA few cards have been modified from the original \"standard\" Lenormand, including the Man and Woman cards. To avoid an unnecessarily limited binary, the Magpie's Lenormand instead has a run of The Caterpillar, The Chrysalid, and The Moth, including art that lines up into a nice scroll, showing this progression.\nEach deck will come with The Magpie's Guide, a 48 pages full color booklet with a hard cover and delicate gold goiling. The Guide will be explaining symbolic meanings for each card. It is measuring 4.72*4.72in // 12*12cm with 135gsm paper and will be fully translated in English and French. Consider this booklet your guide. If you look upon the cards and are unsure what they mean, if no inclination or wisdom comes to you, you may use this to discern meaning. \nHowever, this guide is not law. If the cards have a clear meaning or message for you, what you see in them will always be more important and \"correct\" than what this booklet can tell you. To facilitate this, the booklet will even have some space left for you to contribute your own interpretations of the cards.  \nWe want to encourage people to read the cards from their own perspective, with some helping hands if needed. Follow your heart, and listen to your instincts.\n\n\u25c6 THE OUIJA BOARD \u25c6\nThe Ouija Board is a A5 art print (5,83*8,27in // 21*15cm) printed on 800gsm cardboard. It'll come with a Gold Enamel Planchette (1,5in // 40mm)\nDISCLAIMER: We do not recommend to use this board to contact demons and other occult forces.\n\n\u25c6 THE MAGPIE'S BOX \u25c6\nThe Magpie's Box is a 5,83*8,27in // 21*15cm, 1,2in // 3cm high magnetic flip top box with delicate spot varnish decoration and embossing. The box is designed to house the deck, guide, ouija board, and planchette into a gorgeous object. It might be my favorite addition to our campaign and I love the simple yet lovely look of this packaging.\nHello, Arcturus here! I'm the guidebook writer and resident cartomancy nerd! I had the singular pleasure of watching Rozenn take my interpretations and turn them into beautiful realities.\nWhen first approached for this project, I already knew Rozenn's work and their strengths; she's incredibly talented at soft, colorful nature and anatomy with a fine sense of detail work. So as we brainstormed for the deck, aligning traditional Lenormand with Rozenn's style, I tried to focus on the things I knew she could do well, honing the guidebook into that natural theme. \nEvery card I got back was a delight. The ethereal fluffiness of The Clouds. The precise and careful beehive of The House. The frankly adorable Caterpillar. I have a lot of favorites in the deck, but I would probably pick The Snake and its subtle scaling as my absolute favorite.\nEvery card was hand-painted by hand with a lot of love, ink, and judicious application of bleach. Then, each was scanned into the computer for touch-ups, color correction, and typesetting. While I wrote the guidebook, Rozenn had plenty of say in the matter of how to depict every card, and in the modifications we made to make the deck ours. \nI think the holistic product is great and hope you do too!\n\n\u25c6 ORIGINALS & ART PRINTS \u25c6\nEvery card's original will be available with the Pledge Manager at the end of the campaign, alongside Art prints and every add-on of this campaign.\nIf you are a retailer and interested in the Magpies\u2019 Box, then pledge 4 EUR to \u201cA Blessing\u201d and I will contact you after the campaign. If you have questions, please contact me with a KS personal message.\n\u25c6Important\u25c6\nI only work with brick and mortar stores or stores that are at least partially offline. \nHere you can see a short overview of the shipping costs for all pledge levels (\u20ac1.00 equals approximately $1.20). We have placed much effort into finding options to send everything to your home at a fair price. \nImportant: You don't have to add these shipping prices on top of your pledge, Kickstarter will automatically do this for you.\n \u25c6 Instagram \u25c6 Twitter \u25c6 Youtube \u25c6 Tumblr \u25c6 Facebook \u25c6\n \u25c6 Twitter \u25c6 Tumblr \u25c6\n \u25c6 Website \u25c6\n\u25c6 Music in video \u25c6\nInspired by Kevin MacLeod\nLink: https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/song/3918-inspired\nLicense: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIf 2020 has shown anything, it's that a lot of unexpected things can come up. With that in mind, I have tried to minimize potential problems as much as possible before launching this campaign. All of the art is already completed. The booklet (Guide) is completed and translated. I'm in contact with a well-known manufacturer that has already produced several highly regarded Tarot/Lenormand decks (also for many Kickstarter campaigns). I have valid quotes for all components of this campaign and the same is true for shipping/fulfillment. I truly tried my very best to set everything up as precisely as possible for this project. \n\nThis is my first Kickstarter technically, but I have been freelancing for other people's projects for many years and have seen them to completion. I have also consulted with people who have run very successful Kickstarters to keep my ideas realistic and achievable. \n\nThe biggest risks for this campaign are definitely delays caused by the global pandemic and the corresponding daily changing state of the world. To minimize this risk as much as possible, I have been very careful with the time calculations and have built in a lot of buffers i.e. even if some things don't go as planned, this Kickstarter campaign should still be fulfilled on time. In case of any unforeseen problems (e.g. a lockdown for several months), I will inform all backers immediately and communicate transparently. In addition, I will also do my best to keep the influence of such disruptive factors as small as possible.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u20ac1 or more", "title": "A Blessing", "descp": "The Magpie will sing your name, thank you so much for your support!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2021"}], "stat": ["20 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac12 or more", "title": "The Ouija Board", "descp": "You will receive the Ouija Board with its Enamel planchette.\nINCLUDES:\nThe Planchette\nThe Ouija Board", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Only certain countries"}], "stat": ["6 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac25 or more", "title": "The Magpie's Deck", "descp": "The Magpie's Deck includes all 36 cards of the Magpie's Lenormand, housed in a sturdy tuck box.

Order your copy in advance by supporting our Kickstarter campaign and entertain yourself with one of the world's most monumental poems!\nNine hundred years ago, the German Crusaders were invading the Baltic region under the command of bishop Albert. The Council of the Latvian gods gathered. Under the protection of the Thunder God, P\u0113rkons, they chose a noble warrior who would strive mightily against the forces of evil. This hero was Bearslayer, half man, half bear, the protector of nature and the Latvian people.\n\u201cAndrejs Pumpurs (1841\u20131902) published his epic poem Bearslayer (L\u0101\u010dpl\u0113sis; 1888) against the backdrop of the political and economic monopoly of the German aristocracy, widely relying on Latvian folklore, mythology and historical material. (...) This folktale hero became a cornerstone of Latvian national identity at the time when Latvians were emerging as a modern nation, thus becoming one of the major foundation myths for the Republic of Latvia founded in 1918.\u201d - KASPARS K\u013bAVI\u0145\u0160\nBogdan G\u0103rg\u0103ri\u021b\u0103 painting one of the illustrations for \"Bearslayer\"\nMy name is Bogdan G\u0103rg\u0103ri\u021b\u0103, the Romanian artist behind the illustrations of \u201cBearslayer\u201d. While studying visual arts in Latvia, I became fascinated by their culture, art and architecture and soon decided to illustrate this influential epic poem. I immediately contacted Dr. Arthur Cropley, a renown Australian author, who wrote the only English translation in poetic form of the original Latvian poem, \u201cL\u0101\u010dpl\u0113sis\u201d. He agreed on collaborating for this fantastic project.\nApplying texture on the canvas\nI painted decisive scenes on large canvases, using different techniques for creating the volumes of the decorations, with copper, silver and gold leaf to enrich the oil paintings. This ambitious project took me almost two years. The book is finished and ready for printing.\nPainting details on the canvas\nApplying silver leaf on canvas\n Here are some details of the large paintings Bogdan G\u0103rg\u0103ri\u021b\u0103 made for Bearslayer.\n\"Bearslayer Meets Sp\u012bdala\" - detail\n\"Bearslayer Conquers Demons and Raises the Sunken Castle\" - detail\n\"The Midsummer's Eve Festival\" - detail\n\"P\u0113rkons Casts Lightning, Closing the Pit\" - detail\n\"Bearslayer and the Black Knight fight to the Death\" - detail\nYou can find more details of Bogdan G\u0103rg\u0103ri\u021b\u0103's paintings for Bearslayer at our update section.\nArthur Cropley\nAuthor of the English version of \"Bearslayer\"\nDr. Arthur J. Cropley\nArthur Cropley was born in the remote desert township of Marree, South Australia, in 1935. The treeless desert landscape there could scarcely be more different from the forests of Latvia. Arthur graduated from the University of Adelaide (BA, DipEd), and after seven years as a school teacher in South Australia, England and Canada obtained his PhD in educational psychology from the University of Alberta (Canada) in 1965. He spent almost his entire academic career at the University of Regina (10 years), and the University of Hamburg (20 years). After retiring from Hamburg in 1998 he spent 12 years as a visiting professor at the University of Latvia in Riga. In 2005 he received an honorary doctorate from the University of Latvia and in 2008 was awarded the Order of the Three Stars by the president of Latvia for services to Latvian higher education. His proudest achievement is his translation of L\u0101cpl\u0113sis into English epic poetry. In 2008 this work was honoured by the Latvian Academy of Science as an outstanding achievement of Latvian scholarship.\n\nBogdan G\u0103rg\u0103ri\u021b\u0103\nIllustrator of \"Bearslayer\"\nBogdan G\u0103rg\u0103ri\u021b\u0103\nBogdan G\u0103rg\u0103ri\u021b\u0103 is a painter, graphic artist and illustrator. He graduated from the Bucharest National University of Arts with a Bachelor\u2019s degree in Graphic Arts and has a Master\u2019s degree in Metal. In his final Master\u2019s year, with the support of an Erasmus scholarship, he studied at the Art Academy of Latvia, in Riga, where he was fascinated by Latvian culture, art and architecture. Soon after this experience, illustrating Bearslayer came naturally. Bogdan is a member of the the Visual Artists\u2019 Union of Romania with a rich portfolio in the artistic domain. He has had numerous exhibitions and has received awards in Romania and abroad. He has vast experience in painting and decorating on different supports such as canvas, wood and mural for several museums and locations in Romania. Bogdan also teaches drawing and heraldic painting to children in art schools and during summer camps and Medieval festivals. He has been illustrating books since 1997, and in 2017, together with Maria Po\u0219tea, he founded the Editura Intaglio Publishing House, where he publishes titles for children and adults.\n\"He soon

Although I will do my best to ensure everything is shipped in Feb 2021, some things will be out of my control that can lead to delays such as extended shipping times and manufactory delays. Additionally, there is always a chance that due to delays or misprints of product, this project may run into budget issues. I have accounted for that by slightly overestimating shipping costs as well as adding a cushion however, I am still human and so are our suppliers so mistakes can be made.

But until covid-19 scaled back my graphic design assignments, I never had time. \u2018Round about May, I started sifting through my recipes and collecting cherished ones from family and friends to produce this culinary love letter to my state, my kinfolk and my farm-spent youth. These recipes brought families and friends together for generations and provided delicious fuel for the fun and hard work that made life worth living. And they still do today!\nThe original Wagner family at home in the 1890s. (I\u2019m choosing to believe they were happier than this picture would indicate.)\nI grew up on an 80-acre fruit farm in the coastal town of Ludington, right in the heart of Michigan\u2019s Fruit Belt. The crops we produced supported a family of 11 and gave my mom ample ingredients to fuel the entertaining she so loved. Cocktails for 20. Dinner for 40. Dessert for 100. Mom mixed, cooked and baked up a storm, with assistance from an army of relatives, then emerged from the kitchen to serve as the life of the party. \nThe Wagner homestead in 1947.\nI inherited Mom\u2019s love of entertaining as well as her recipes. This Michigan Treasures & Traditions cookbook is a tribute to her and Dad (he grew all the food!), as well as to the family and friends who have made my life richer, on and off the farm. All 233 of these recipes were tested and tasted by myself or one of the special people in my life. You\u2019ll meet them through the recipes and stories in the book \u2013 people like my Grandma Henrietta, whose Soda Cracker Pie was a Depression-era favorite. \nThe flavor of Pecan Pie, but minus the richness. (You can eat a bigger piece.)\nTypical designer. Recipe cards and bookmarks coordinate nicely. I just can't help myself.\nThe final product will be a beautifully printed 160-page, full-color cookbook with a metal spiral binding so it lays nice and flat for simple use.\nAs you can see, a ton of recipes!\nWhile Mom relied heavily on fresh fruits and vegetables harvested from the garden, she was also eminently practical. She didn\u2019t turn her nose up at store-bought produce. She rarely rolled her own pie crusts. And easier was always better. Following her lead, the recipes in this book are simple to follow and use readily available ingredients. They\u2019re also pretty darn delicious, if I do say so myself. I hope you enjoy preparing the food, reading the stories and making your own special memories!\nRewards. Each project sponsor at the $25 or higher level will receive one or more copies of this beautiful, collectible and amazingly useful cookbook. I strongly recommend you pledge at a level that gets you extra copies to share with friends who probably should be cooking dinner for you. They make great housewarming gifts and are also great for holiday gifting! (Spoiler alert: there\u2019s a ton of great holiday cookie recipes in the book and more desserts than salads). I'm also including recipes cards and handy bookmarks so you can flag recipes that interest you without bending the precious pages. \nSpecifications. 8.5\" x 8.5\" in size. 160 pages in full color, with a metal spiral binding and cardstock cover in a beautiful matte finish.\nIllustrations, Designs, Photographs and Copy. I\u2019m a graphic designer and I created the graphics and the design for this book and did most of the mouthwatering food photography after cooking or baking the recipes in my kitchen. It\u2019s amazing I don\u2019t weigh 500 pounds after all of that but my friends and family were extremely helpful in properly disposing of the food. They also helped me find some great old photos to help tell our Fruit Belt family story. And speaking of stories, my good friend and colleague Mike Dykstra helped me turn my stories and thoughts into the well-written copy that you\u2019ll read in the book. After all, I\u2019m a graphic designer. Definitely not a writer!\n\nWhat people are saying\n\u201cI asked Greg if this was a low-fat cookbook. He said, \u2018Yeah, the fat will sit real low on your waist.\u201d\n*****************\n\u201cThe photos look good enough to eat. Yum!\u201d\n*****************\n\u201cI appreciate a cookbook that acknowledges the value of a good cocktail.\u201d\n*****************\n\u201cI\u2019m just a bit put out because Greg\u2019s never made the Peanut Butter Pie (page 135) for me.\u201d\n*****************\n\u201cRecipes so easy my kids can follow them \u2013 if they ever finish with their online learning.\u201d\n*****************\n\u201cI just read the cookbook cover-to-cover and discovered that 30% of the recipes are for desserts. I call that a well-balanced diet!\u201d\n*****************\n\nSigned Copies. If you ever watch Antiques Roadshow\u00ae or Pawn Stars\u00ae, you know that signed first editions of books are where the real value is\u2026so I\u2019m going to personally sign each and every book that is a Kickstarter reward. In a fun colored ink. You\u2019re welcome!\nSchedule. This book is designed and written and the page files are almost complete. I\u2019ve been working with a printer I\u2019m very confident with so I feel safe in promising shipping in December if the project is funded. That should give you plenty of time to try some of the appetizer and drink recipes while baking several of the holiday cookie recipes included in the book before ringing in the new year!\nShipping. Kickstarter will add the cost of shipping to your pledge based on where you live.\nUpdates & Progress Reports. Sure thing! I\u2019ll definitely do a couple of these so you know what\u2019s happening with your cookbooks. But I won\u2019t overload your inbox with a lot of annoying nonsense. I promise.\nQuestions.

A hearty set of 10 vibrant and fun hard enamel pins expressing every board game addict's most commonly used sayings and little inside jokes!\nI'm Michelle, I am a designer who married a board gamer, and this pin set is the result. \nIf you missed part one, scroll down to the bottom to see pictures from the previous mega set of board gamer pins. If you're a previous backer, welcome back! To thank you all for your patience, I am just going to come out and give all returning backers 1 free pin! Check the FAQ for more info and thanks for coming back!\nThank you for backing this campaign!\nBy backing this campaign, you get:\nTo be FIRST to get your hands on these pins, before they're available for sale to anyone else\nAccess to these major bundle discounts (including a free pin for returning backers) that won't be matched after the campaign\nFree stickers included with your rewards!\n Free Bonus stretch goals! (scroll down for more info) \nPins that aren't funded during this campaign won't exist later, so thank you for giving these pins a chance!\n(Give this gif a minute to load for maximum shininess!)\nThe Pins:\nThe main funding goal of $400 covers this first tier \"All These Board Games\" pin AND Sticker Sheet. Each additional $400 raised after that funds and unlocks another pin that you will be able to pick as a reward!\n\n\nEach of these pins will be made with :\n Black Nickel metal plating\n 2 pinbacks with clear rubber clutches to eliminate spinning and keep your pin secure\nWhite, grays, and a color pop of these playful, bright colors (except for the first pin, which gets ALL the colors!) These were designed with pantone colors to ensure accuracy in manufacturing, but please note that all screens display colors a little differently. (If you bought the first set, the colors will match, plus two new colors added for this set)\nHard Enamel\nIf you're familiar with the last set of pins, these pins are all the same size as the \"board gamer\" pin, except \"All these board games\", which is a little big taller.\nThe preview images you see on this page are mockup renderings! While the real pins will be shiny and pretty, of course nothing in real life can be as perfectly flat and glossy as a digital rendering (nor can they stand up magically on their own). For a realistic idea of how the final pins will look, please see some actual photographs of the first kickstarter set at the bottom of this page.\nFREEBIE Game-Weight Stickers:\n5 stickers will be unlocked alongside the pins in the campaign and included for FREE according to your reward level! They will be sturdy, glossy stickers, 2.5 in. tall, on heavy duty vinyl. \n\nSticker Sheet:\nThis 5x7 inch sticker sheet is unlocked from the get-go and includes sticker versions of all of the 10 pin designs. These individual stickers are ~1.5 in. tall, the same size as their pin brethren. (You'll also be able to add these to your reward later in the survey if you want.)\nEdit: I realize I left out the sticker sheet as a listed item in the top tier $85 10 pin reward slot but listed it in the description. I cannot edit the reward now that the campaign is running, but just to be clear, backers of this 10-pin reward tier WILL get the sticker sheet AND all 5 game weight stickers!\n\nBonus Stretch Goal Freebies!\nYou have all gone above and beyond what I expected for this kickstarter, so here\u2019s more FREE STUFF!! Magnets are free to ALL pin backers (everyone who has backed for at least 1 pin reward) and will automatically be added to your reward. Keychains are free and automatically added to all backers of AT LEAST 6 pins. If we get all the way to $9000, everyone who has backed at least 1 pin will get a free embroidered patch! These are cumulative, so if we make it to $9000 you\u2019ll get all of these extra stretch goal items for which you are eligible!\nAll of these extra stretch goals that we unlock will be available as ADD-ONS in the backerkit survey, so even if you backed for the sticker-only rewards and aren\u2019t eligible to get a keychain for free, you can still get one for $10 USD plus shipping (or a patch or magnet for $5 USD) and shipped with your other rewards.\nA flexible magnet perfect for your refrigerator or other magnetic surface! \n\nSlightly smaller than the pins themselves (so it won\u2019t be too clunky if it\u2019s on your keys).\nSame width as the \u201call these board games\u201d magnet.\n\nI do not have a realistic looking preview of how this patch will look when embroidered with thread, so you\u2019ll have to use your imagination. It may look slightly different than this mock up, as the edges will be sewn, but I\u2019m confident it\u2019s going to end up looking hella cool. It will include 11 colors of thread and I\u2019m very excited to see it!\nAdd-Ons\nI get lots of questions about add-ons (which you can also read about in the FAQ) but here's some basic info to help familiarize you with what you can do to get more stuff in addition to your pledged campaign reward, that'll be shipped at the same time as your pledge reward.\nYou can either wait for the backerkit survey after the campaign to purchase these items, or you may want to add the extra amount to your pledge NOW in your campaign pledge manager. That way you'll get charged the extra amount at the same time as you are charged for your main kickstarter pledge and the credit will be waiting for you so you can select extra pins and stickers in the backerkit survey and not be charged a second time. This will also avoid any extra transaction fees from a second transaction.\nCool, so some of the things you'll be able to add-on:\nThe previous campaign's 15 pin set \"Board Game Genres\" will all be available to purchase for $11 USD per pin\nThe previous campaign's 2.5 in. stickers (ask me about my kallax, first player, rules lawyer, less AP more VP) will be available for $3 USD per sticker\nThe previous campaign's sticker sheet of 15 game genre stickers will be available for $5 USD per sheet\nTHIS CAMPAIGN's freebie game weight stickers will be available for $3 USD per sticker\nTHIS CAMPAIGN's sticker sheet will be available for $5 USD per sheet\nMy \"Dragon's D20\" enamel pin (view on my site if you're curious!)\nAll additional unlocked Stretch Goal items from this campaign (keychains for $10 USD, magnets for $5 USD, and patch for $5 USD)\n\nTimeline\nAll of the design files have been finalized and approved and quoted by my manufacturing partner, who brought the last gorgeous set to life. Here's how I expect the next few months to go, barring any additional craziness in the world:\nOctober: This campaign will be live\nNovember: Surveys sent out\nMid-November: Funds received, pins and stickers begin manufacturing\nJanuary: Completed pins and stickers shipped to me and I begin checking them for quality and packaging them up for you\nLate January-February: Rewards sent out!\n(A note on international shipping: I am planning to use USPS First Class International Package service to save you all some cash, but it may take the pins weeks longer to reach you. During the last campaign, some people had significant postal system and customs delays. So, while you should expect between 7-21 days, there may be delays beyond this time frame. If you are an international backer and would like faster shipping, you can ADD $12 USD to your pledge, and I will ship your package USPS Priority, which should arrive in about a week. This option will also be available in the backerkit.)\nFunding Breakdown\nOf the initial $400 funding goal - covering the \"All These Board Games\" pin and sticker sheet - the budget breaks down as follows:\n70% Manufacturing costs for pins and stickers\n20% Shipping costs\n5-10% Kickstarter Fees\nThe FINAL first set of board gamer pins from the first kickstarter\nThe FINAL first set of board gamer pins and stickers from the first kickstarter\nThe best way to be sure that your favorite pin gets unlocked is to share this campaign with all of your board game night regulars! You can find posts to share on my instagram and twitter pages @polliadesign (and also a lot of other sketches, dice, and fun designs, if you feel like browsing!)\nThank you so much for supporting this campaign, these pins can't make it off the sketchbook page without each and every one of you!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\n*Backers are responsible for any customs and import taxes that may apply once the packages are out of my hands. I cannot take responsibility for any delays due to customs.*\n\nAs stated above, the use of pantone colors ensures that the colors will be very close to what you see in the previews, but colors display differently on screens, so there may be some difference in the actual pin colors.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nLong-lasting design\nThese hard enamel pins are sturdy and designed without any breakable moving parts or sharp appendages.

There is a framework, a set of agreed-upon rules for experiencing it, but ultimately the bulk of the application is left up to the players. This parallel between Troika and tarot felt interesting, so I began looking at how cards could be interpreted into Backgrounds.\"\nArticles of the Arcana is a tarot-inspired supplement for Troika, the other world's favorite RPG, created by the Melsonian Arts Council. It is a collection of new character options, devious enemies, and a tarot-themed campaign setting, all accompanied by dozens of pieces of beautiful art crafted by an amazing array of artists. In addition, we are creating a physical tarot deck to use with the book or as a stand-alone divination tool. \nTroika is a tabletop roleplaying game that focuses on telling awesome stories without getting bogged down in rules. This meshes perfectly with tarot, which encourages you to interpret and impart meaning onto the game, not be confined or dictated by it. If you're looking for a game that will let you tell amazing stories, Troika is for you. For a quick primer on Troika, we recommend checking out the official Troika website.\nIf you don't already own a copy of Troika! Numinous Edition, you can get a digital copy during this campaign over 50% off; check the Rewards section below for more info. \nIn addition to providing backers with amazing rewards, we are committed to making gaming more accessible to those experiencing financial hardship. For every digital or physical copy of Articles of the Arcana pledged for during this campaign, a free digital community copy will be made available on Itch. Gaming is for everyone. \nArticles of the Arcana is a beautifully illustrated book to add to your Troika collection, either digitally or physically. The cover is illustrated and designed by the talented Ignacio Paul and features subtle and not-so-subtle imagery inspired by tarot. This cover perfectly sums up the awe and splendor of the contents within. The physical book will be an A5 matte softcover, full color throughout, featuring 72 pages of content and art. \nMock up of softcover book design.\nThe book contains 36 new character backgrounds each inspired by a card in the tarot, including the entire Major Arcana. You'll also find new skills and spells for your character to utilize, fantastical enemies to challenge them, and 22 campaign prompts, each representing a part of the journey described in the Major Arcana. It has everything you need to tarot your Troika in style.\nEach background is accompanied by tarot cards illustrated by Alex Perkins, Bri de Danann, Matthew Cartwright, and Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Lanz. The book is rounded out with a collection of new enemies and a playable adventure and world-building advice, featuring art from Alec Sorensen and Amanda Franck.\nPreview of The Fool and The Magician Backgrounds.\nWhether you are here to add to your bookshelf, digital collection, or to put amazing art on your walls, we have a pledge level that is sure to suit your tastes.

This allows us to fund the rest of the art needed for the book as well as manufacture amazing books and art prints. Thank you!\nUNLOCKED! $6,000 - Full Tarot Deck : At this point, we will be able to fund the creation of an entire 72 card tarot deck's worth of art.

We will also be increasing the artists' rate by $50 each.\n$9,000 - Hardcover Book Option : Maybe softcover isn't your thing, and that's OK.

Tarot is a visual experience and needed to be done properly by some very talented artists. \n $1,200 - Printing : This money will be used to convert the digital files into physical artifacts, including a 72-page full-color softcover book and 5x7 art prints.\n $800 - Fees : This covers Kickstarter's fees, credit card processing fees, and setup fees for Backerkit. Everyone gets their cut.\n $400 - Buffer : Even though I've spent days working on a budget, contacting manufacturing partners, and working out rates with artists, there's always a chance something changes. This money will be used for any unforeseen costs. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI have run and fulfilled several projects including physically manufactured goods and international shipping.

The Normal Tarot 2: Actual Vengeance This Time, Maybe. Last year, we launched the Normal Tarot 2: Revenge Kickstarter. At the time, I was trying to be realistic with a low goal, with the goal of funding the deck in parts over time. Then people backed the hell out of it and we funded with over 2x the amount we needed to get the deck made. It was awesome. We ran out of extra decks almost immediately, and created a print on demand version that was just less cool. It didn't have silver gilded edges, and it didn't come in a box.\nThis time, the original deck by Amy Smith is back with a darker take, silver foil, better gilding, and a cooler box, and it's not alone!\nIntroducing the Normal Tarot 2: Actually #2 This Time. A black deck with white details, gold foil, and gold trim. For this deck, the artist from Furiously Prognosticating and the cover of the previous tarot book is doing the deck, and the deck artist from last time is doing the new book's cover. We thought it might be fun to switch things around.\nThat gives us TWO unique takes on the Normal Tarot design in one Kickstarter. No matter which one you pledge for, you are going to get a gorgeous deck with foil designs, gilded edges, and a lovely box! Do you want Amy's Silver, or Sam's Gold? Both? With or without a guidebook? Because no one on this campaign is getting a bland deck, I can assure you of that!\n\n The Deck(s)\nThe Normal Tarot is a not-so-normal tarot deck created by the one and only Caretaker of Normal Horoscopes fame. If you aren't familiar with them, go read up on their blog. They post horoscopes, answer people's asks, give fortunes, research magic, demonology, and create incredibly unique tarot decks.\nThe deck features 99 cards, with a replaced major arcana (6 books, 8 moons, 7 kings, several wild cards, & 5 jokers) and suits replaced with seasons, featuring 3 knights and 3 queens (Lady, Queen, Mother) each. You can see 3 card readings and many of the cards on their blog here.\nThe Caretaker is also updating the guidebook, and each will have the same guidebook, just with different cover art and the different deck's card arts on its pages.\nThe Silver version is the original, now with silver foil designs on the fronts. It comes with silver gilded edges and a silver foil pressed, two piece card box to keep the cards safe on a high quality black core card stock. Illustrated by the incredible Amy Smith.\nThe complete silver tarot, over half updated! Blue is where the silver foil will be!\n\nThe Gold version is #2, with gold foil designs on the fronts. It comes with gold gilded edges and a gold foil pressed, two piece card box to keep the cards safe on a high quality black core card stock. Illustrated by the incredible Samantha Dow, Charmingly Antiquated on tumblr, and runner of Elsewhere University.\nThe entire Gold Tarot\nReward Tiers\nIf you get here early, you can grab the early bird specials to save 10$. I know that for many right now money is tight due to Covid and otherwise. Please leave the early bird tiers if you can afford to pay for the main tiers.\nOtherwise it's $40 for a deck, $50 for a deck and book combo, and $90 to get both decks with both books, or $110 to get both decks with both books AND a set of the Publishing Goblin's Oracle Dice and book. Any tier that gets a deck or oracle dice gets a PDF of the guidebook!\nRetailers can grab 5 copies of either deck with book for $125, but they must contact me before pledging and clear what their store is/make sure they actually have a store. \nAdd Ons\nWe are lucky to be one of the first campaigns trying out the new integrated add ons for Kickstarter, and are we going to use it!\nAdd on an extra Deck of either for $40, or Deck and book for $50.\nAdd on a 5x7 foil postcard for $10.\nPins add on for $8 per pin.\nStickers at $4 a sticker.\nPublishing Goblin's Oracle Dice & Book for $25.\n\n\nCheck out their kickstarter now!\nF(r)iction's issues are full of incredible stories and art, and the covers are all shiny and holographic!\n\nWho We Are\nThe Original Designer, Occultist, Demonologist, Fortune Giver, and Diviner: The Caretaker!

They run Normal Horoscopes, designed the Normal Tarot (and did all the write ups in the books!) and just are really fucking cool. Follow them on tumblr or twitter, and ask for a fortune! Make sure you offer something in return, though. And don't type in all caps, that's their thing.

Packed with flavour, and with a chemical structure that impacts a recipe beyond the taste, the alcohol shelf provides an intriguing variety of ingredients for the home cook to explore.\n\nDiscover recipes like Mojito Chicken, Fennel & White Wine Tagliatelle, Tequila & Haba\u00f1ero Salmon, Salted Caramel and Spiced Rum Brownies, Amaretto and Ginger Cheesecake, or make your own Cider Mustard!\nTequila & Haba\u00f1ero Salmon with Salsa Fresca and Black Beans\nThis book isn\u2019t full of luxury foods, and it isn\u2019t about consuming large amounts of alcohol. The focus is on finding enjoyment through sharing innovative and delicious food with loved ones, whether that\u2019s midweek Sticky Cider Sausages with Mustard Mash or treating your friends to a plateful of Coconut Rum and Raspberry Cupcakes. We've made sure there are plenty of recipes for meat eaters and vegetarians alike.\n\nGood food shouldn't take all night to cook! This book contains a balance of easy recipes for a weeknight dinner (like Port Pesto with Rigatoni, or Cheddar & Stout Risotto) with more extravagant dishes that take a bit longer (like our delicious Beer & Baileys Doughnuts). \nSticky Cider Sausages with Mustard Mash, and Cheddar & Stout Risotto\n\nWe're so excited to be working with hybrid publisher Lendal Press, an imprint of Valley Press, to publish this book in April 2021. We need your help to show that that there's a market for this book that we love and believe in so much, and to contribute to the costs of the first print run (more details below).\n\nChapters\n The chapters in the book are:\nStarters & Small Plates\nMains\nSide Dishes\nDesserts\nSavoury Baking\nSweet Baking\n  There will be two indexes at the back - one alphabetical, and one by alcohol. There will also be a page at the back with the names of our amazing Kickstarter backers!\nChicken with Brandy & Apricots and Tequila Key Lime Pie (aka Te-key-lime Pie)\n\n\n What will this book look like? \nCooking with Alcohol will be a hardcover book, size 7\" x 10\" (18cm x 25cm), with no dust jacket. Each recipe will have a photograph, so you know what you're cooking! We all know that if a recipe doesn't have a photo, there's no chance we'll cook it.\nThe pages will be high quality paper with a matte coating to prevent glare on the recipes as you cook. There will be 200-240 pages in total. \nCover design yet to be confirmed.\nAbout the authors\nWe are Aaron and Susannah Rickard - two friendly people in our late twenties, based in Bath in the south west of England. We are not professional cooks, but cooking is well and truly our passion! \n\nThis book has been developed in our kitchen over the last four years. It began as a dinner with friends, themed on alcohol food. When thinking up recipes to cook for the dinner, the possibilities with alcohol seemed endless and we could hardly decide what to make! With so many ideas, we began testing recipes at home for ourselves. All of the recipes in Cooking with Alcohol have been tested (multiple times), written and photographed in our flat.\n\nSusannah is in the international business team for a herbal tea company. Australian-born and now UK-based, she spent a number of years working for a recipe kit company (The Spicery in Bristol), including writing and testing hundreds of recipes in the development kitchen. This expertise ensures that Cooking with Alcohol is clearly written, with thorough instructions designed for the home cook.\nAaron is a web developer in London and a keen food photographer. With American heritage and a multicultural upbringing he's a fan of food from all over the world. As well as creating recipes, Aaron brings the technical and editing expertise to our photography & the beautiful typesetting of the pages.\nSloe Gin & Blackberry Cobbler and Salted Caramel Spiced Rum Brownies\nWe both have a love for other cultures, and this has greatly influenced our cooking style. For example, recipes such as our Bourbon Brined Beef Short Ribs are influenced by Aaron's love of Texas BBQ, while Chorizo in Red Wine and Honey is inspired by a dish that we loved in Barcelona.\nWe\u2019re fascinated by using new techniques and learning the science behind the food. In Cooking with Alcohol we share the science of how alcohol changes food, and we use innovative techniques when they are relevant - you'll find this in our Red Wine Focaccia and our vegan Alcoholic Chocolate Mousse (made with any alcohol for infinite variations), among others. \n\nThere are so many wonderful ways that alcohol can impact flavour and cooking techniques and bring something truly special to the table!\n\nSee what\u2019s cooking at @rickardkitchen, or sign up to the mailing list on our website. The talented @hellonickyg created the book visualisations. \nSix varieties of Alcoholic Chocolate Mousse\nHow far along is the project?\nFar! \n\nAll the recipes have been written and tested and 90% have been photographed. Our recipe testers (also called friends) are busy testing what recipes they can to gather as much extra feedback as possible.\nWe will be making edits with Lendal Press during October & November, and working on cover design & other details during December. \nProviding that the funding target has been met, the first print run will take place in February 2021. The publication date is expected to be April 2021. We cant wait!\n\n Why are you crowdfunding for this book? \nThis is our first book. We are delighted to have found a great publisher to work with (Lendal Press, an imprint of Valley Press) and signed a contract with them for Cooking with Alcohol. As Lendal are a small independent publisher, they work on a hybrid publishing model - this means that we need to raise half of the costs of the first print run through crowdfunding. This proves that the book has a market and reduces the financial risk on a small publishing house. Visit their websites to read more about Lendal Press and Valley Press, and the hybrid publishing model.\nThe fundraising target (\u00a34200) will cover 50% of the costs of the first print run. Once the Kickstarter has been fully funded we'll be able to finalise the publication date and initiate the first print run. \nSalted Caramel & Spiced Rum Brownies\nMushroom & Stout Pasties and White Wine Pound Cake\nChicken, Amaretto & Saffron Biryani", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is a low risk project: we have already signed a contract with Lendal Press to publish this book.

Thank you Starr!! <3 Please watch the video above!\nUpdate: READ A SHORT PREQUEL COMIC  HERE\nUpdate 2: Funded!!! <3 I love you all so much!\nThe Story\nRei, or, Reille Arsen DeRovio Akelli used to be the Second Prince of Astye. After his recent banishment, Rei turned to petty crime to survive, getting involved with a gang of thieves. However, once the gang discovers he\u2019s an ex-prince with a bounty on his head, they turn on him, planning to trade him for the reward money.\nWaldon Max is a simple florist, a widower, and a single father. One day, Rei suddenly breaks into his shop, claiming to have escaped a gang chasing him. Haunted by his dark past, Waldon initially tries to attack the intruder, only to realize his mistake and apologize. He offers Rei shelter from the gang in exchange for helping around the shop after his young daughter takes a liking to Rei. Despite being nervous that his royal origins and the bounty on his head will catch up to him again, Rei accepts.\nHowever, as Rei and Waldon fall into a comfortable routine managing the flower shop, Rei\u2019s secret past isn\u2019t the only thing keeping a wall between them; there\u2019s a mysterious shadow following them around town, and Waldon isn\u2019t surprised by it. Fearing for their safety, Rei demands answers, but the florist ends up giving him a request instead: asking for help in taking down this mysterious figure who's been haunting Waldon for years.\nAs the attraction between them is heightened by the threat of danger, Rei and Waldon must fight the demons of their pasts- together.\nThe Book \nThe Fox and the Fallen Prince (80,000 words) is a Romance/Fantasy title with alternating perspectives between Rei and Waldon. Despite the amount of art on this page, it is a prose book, although we have a stretch goal of insert illustrations and I have drawn header images for each chapter. The book is New Adult but with a much lighter and more humorous tone like those found in YA. Although there's nothing explicit, there is a fair bit of innuendo and swearing, so I would rate it 18+ to be safe. Content and Trigger warnings will be at the bottom of this page!\nRei is trans and gay, Waldon is bi, one of the main antagonists is nonbinary, and most of the cast is LGBT in some way. As a lesbian, I really like to see stories about my community set in fun fictional settings that they aren\u2019t commonly seen in. I have also had several nonbinary and trans sensitivity readers to make sure my portrayal of those identities is accurate.\nThis book is the first in a five-book series that centers on self-improvement and forgiveness. I have all five fully outlined, and am currently writing book two.\nThe first chapter of this book will be posted in the updates tab! I encourage you to read it before pledging :D\n Why Kickstarter?\nI've tried querying the book a couple of times, and the traditional publishing world is definitely becoming more open to LGBT projects, but I don't think they're quite ready yet for an (admittedly weird) story like this one. I would rather get the book to the people it was written for as soon as possible, which would be you! This book is very special to me and I hope that you all will love it as much as I do.\nI do plan on eventually putting the book up on Kindle after the campaign, but getting your name on the 'Thank You Backers\" page will remain Kickstarter exclusive and be printed in all future copies.\n The Rewards\nThe book!! 6x9 softcover of around 250 pages.\nBook Cover by Irene - @CrowLaDee\nLettering on the Cover by Hanna - @Hanna.font\nPride Miniprint by Julian - @FainFaineant\nPattern Bookmark by Lizzy - @LizzyItzkowitz\nStickers by Mar - @MarshMallorca\nThe \"Signed and Doodled in\" tier will include my signature and a doodle of one of the characters.\nThe 'Fox' Goodies tier will include the bookmark, miniprint, and both stickers.\nThe 'Book 2 Preview' tier will include the prologue and chapter 1 of Book 2, with the working title 'The Palace of Ice and Ivory.'\nThe 'Prince' tier includes getting your name, or a name of your choosing, into the book as a side character. The flower shop has several regular customers that appear throughout the book, that could be you! After the Kickstarter I will reach out to you so we can pick a name :D\nBudgeting\nAll shipping will be charged through BackerKit after the campaign has ended. This is to allow for more accurate shipping prices and to allow people to purchase additional items after the campaign. The current estimate is $7 for North America (USA, Canada, Mexico) and $18 for everywhere else.\nIn addition to paying for printing, merch, and paying artists, it's very important to me to pay for a professional line editing. This will make sure there are no grammar or punctuation mistakes in the final draft, as well as improve the overall quality.\nStretch Goals\n$3,000 - Fully Funded! I will be super grateful that the book is happening!\n$3,750 - Each artist will get an increase in pay!\n$4,000 - An additional short story starring Rei and Scarlet will be added to the book!\n$4,100 - 5,000 - For every $100 above $4,000, Irene will do an insert illustration for a scene in the book. Max: 10.\nReviews\n\"The Fox and the Fallen Prince is a thoroughly fun ride from start to finish. With fast-paced scenes and hilarious dialogue, it\u2019s almost impossible to put this book down. With characters so real you feel like you know them, wonderful LQBTQ+ rep, insanely charismatic antagonists, and a love story that is classic and fresh in all the right ways, The Fox and the Fallen Prince is an unforgettable story.\" - Katje\n\"This story, beyond its mysteries, wit, and drama, is incredibly charmingly warm.

Si vous le souhaitez, vous pourrez retrouver la traduction int\u00e9grale de toute la campagne Kickstarter \u00e0 l\u2019identique et en fran\u00e7ais \u00e0 l\u2019adresse suivante : https://www.arcanya.fr \nWe all know that there are dark days, bad times, sorrows and sufferings which, however unbearable they may be, will not last forever. However, when the heart bleeds and becomes so heavy that our legs can no longer carry us, sometimes we forget it. Then you collapse in the dark, alone like drifting dust in the universe.\nI created the Mornes Plaines of Arcanya to help those who go through life's trials not to forget it, and to remember that even in the darkest moments, each of us has an infinite source of light, and unsuspected resources to rise again, stronger and greater than we were before.\nThe world of Arcanya seems hopelessly lost. This is a kingdom where the abyss buries every living thing. The 4 elements, Earth (the Pentacles), Air (the Swords), Water (the Cups) and Fire (the Wands) have given way to Stones, Wind, Rain and Ashes.\nYet it is a kingdom that belongs to you to cross, alongside the Magician, Justice, the Emperor or the Star to explore your own universe, to mobilize your own forces and your own resources, whose existence you have sometimes forgotten. You are the only person capable of repelling your Darkness. Have faith in yourself, and soon the Sun will illuminate again the Mornes Plaines of Arcanya.  \nTo show you the prices in dollars, the amounts in euros have been converted at the time of the campaign launch. Slight variations may occur until final settlement. In case of doubt, only the amounts in euros are authentic.\nHere is an extract from the sublime symphonic orchestration composed by Lisa Van Hal, and a small note from her and the soloist singer Julie Elven, who will sing on the main theme of Arcanya.\nPLAY\n\nJulie Elven is a soundtrack and filmscore vocalist. She has contributed as a soloist to major video games such as Horizon Zero Dawn, League of Legends, World of Warcraft, Hearthstone, Honor of Kings, Star Citizen, Tomb Raider and more. In 2017, Julie was selected to perform The Hanging Tree solo from The Hunger Games movie.  \nHere is a quick preview about Arcanya \u2013 the boardgame. This video dont explain the detailed rules, it just give you a first look on the type of game. \nPLAY\n\nThe booklet includes French and English translations from the outset.  \nThe remaining cards have already been studied and designed, but having them drawn by Anna represents an important workload, in terms of time and means, which only the project funding will be able to complete. \nThe Sacred Grimoire of the High Priestess, an authentic and imposing 220-page book, created by hand (see video below). You can order your copy at the same time as the deck (10 books available).  \nPLAY\n\n(Sold without frame) \n The longest side of a sticker measure 3,15\u2032 \nWhen you choose an offer, you will still be able to modify the amount you wish to donate (see the image above). You will not be able to give less, but you can always give more. This is the system that will allow you to add the options you want.\nExample : If you have chosen the Kaldaryn Pledge (i.e. just the deck : \u20ac59/$70), but you want to add the 3 exclusive cards and 3 posters, you will just have to add the price of the exclusive cards (\u20ac10 x3 = \u20ac30/$36) and the price of 3 posters (12\u20ac x 3 = +36\u20ac/$42) to the normal price of the chosen offer (\u20ac59 + \u20ac30 + \u20ac36 = 125\u20ac/$148). You will then have to select the Kaldaryn Pledge and indicate an amount of 125\u20ac/$148. (Reminder : the best offer, the \u201call-inclusive\u201d pack, is 119\u20ac/$132 for 48 hours)\nYOU WILL BE ABLE TO SPECIFY THE POSTERS YOU WANT AND ALL THE DETAILS OF YOUR COMMITMENT AT THE END OF THE CAMPAIGN IN THE PLEDGE MANAGER. IT IS ALSO AT THIS STAGE THAT THE SHIPPING COSTS WILL BE ADDED. \nBONUS : as a bonus, here\u2019s a short film / trailer that was directed by Sebastien Weiss and Nico Pfister Photography with LucioleS Cosplay, and which nicely illustrates the universe of Arcanya.

However! (the fancy but) This deck is a symbol of dreams coming true, and that means the deck will also come true. I found a different printing company where there isn\u2019t a minimum order required. Let's call it Plan B!\nI just ordered a first sample to see how the deck will look and I\u2019m very excited about it, and I hope that you are too! There will be a few changes overall because the printing companies don\u2019t have the same options. If you are still interested in the deck, I will post more information about it on my Instagram, feel free to visit me any time: @soulpathic\nIn the meantime I thank you all so much, for all your support and all lovely and motivating messages.\nIt was a lovely experience to create this campaign and to meet all of you. I am so happy that I got this far and I\u2019m not planning on stopping here.  \n\u2018I\u2019m so excited, I\u2019m jumping to heaven!\u2019\nThe Peaceful Mind Tarot Deck consists of 78 Tarot Cards (22 Major Arcana and 56 Minor Arcana). The deck is based on traditional Rider Waite Tarot system.\nThe Deck will be presented in a lovely book shape box. The cards will be printed on 400gsm, matte laminated card stock with matte pastel pink edges. The size of the tarot cards is 3.5 x 5.75 inches (88.9mm x 146mm) - bigger than usual tarot size.\nRENDERING - Final deck may have slight differences.\nTwo of the cards have changed names: The Magician has become The Mage, and The Hierophant has become Spirit Guide.\nEach Major Arcana card includes astrology and zodiac correspondence - Planet symbols on the right, zodiac symbols on the left and each minor arcana includes 4 elements symbol on the top of each card.\nThe printing company I'm collaborating with has years of experience and has produced hundreds of thousands of decks (tarot, oracle, poker, etc). Including decks from previous Kickstarter campaigns. The very professional contact I have with the company and lovely customer service, enabled for me to view a few videos so I could ensure the quality of the product, specifically the quality of the cards and box manufacture. I am very pleased, and I trust that the final outcome will be more than satisfying. Please note, the printed samples, card images and booklet on the video is not 100% final, there have been changes and improvements.\nThese are not final cards, I hand cut out the sample I recieved. Final cards will be more vivid than the sample print.\nThe Peaceful Mind Tarot deck will also come with a 60 page beginner's guide booklet (b&w inside pages, full colour cover). Pretty simple and basic meanings for each card as my wish is for you to connect with the deck and give the cards new meanings, based on your intuition and feelings.

Not being in a great place myself I started to explore with spirituality, meditation and tarot. Like a lot of us I watched Youtube channels all with fantastic readers, I watched and admired them... I was simply fascinated how those beautiful images can awaken our intuition, our imagination to be able to see and tell stories and situations that have happened and that could possibly happen soon. I need this in my life! This is what I was missing! With getting to know each card, its symbolism's and primary meanings I decided to create my own deck, it helped me a lot with visualising and memorizing. Creating this deck brought so much happiness and peace into my life. As artists we have our ups and downs and sometimes we don't know what to do with ourselves however, every time I could see the progress of the deck it helped me come back on track. There were many changes involved, and once I was happy with the final card design, a week later I said it's not good enough! (who else is guilty?!) It's a project that consumed my time in the best way. It's a big part of my heart and if it will ever reach to being an actual deck, I hope it will bring you so much lovely energy, happiness and peace as much as it brought to me whilst I was creating it.\nMy name is Aleksandra, I live in the UK and I am a print designer and visual artist. I'm the Fool on my spiritual journey which I would like to share with you. Creating The Peaceful Mind Tarot deck was the beginning of the process of stepping out of my comfort zone, of helping me realise that everyone deserves to go for their dreams instead of letting the fear step ahead, and create an invisible barrier that seems impossible to overtake. We've all been there and we all need a little push sometimes to step forward. Let's this lovely deck be that light thrust, a symbol of mind balance that will remind us to not be afraid of dreaming and reaching high. \nThank you so much for being here and thank you for your support!

Help us reach our stretch goals so we can make more rodeos and pay our cowpokes!\nIsn't about a time we celebrated queer artists in country music?\nI'm Rachel Cholst, a music journalist from New York City who has been writing about the queer country music community for the last 9 years. My articles have appeared in No Depression, Wide Open Country, The Boot, Country Queer, and my own blog and podcast Adobe & Teardrops. I have also launched two successful Kickstarter campaigns for my comic, Artema.\nIt's been a dream of mine to create a zine to celebrate queer country music: one where writers can get paid and we can share our stories far and wide. As far as I know, this will be the first physical magazine ever solely devoted to queer country music.\nWhy should the zine be limited to bookstores? If artists sell the zine at their merch tables, we can spread the word about each other and build community. Not only do we create emotional bonds, but we can support each other financially as well. \nEach article in our very first issue tells the story of artists growing into their communities. Become a part of community by contributing today. \nThe zine will be 4.25\" x 11\", 28 pages with a full-color glossy cover (see above.) Our initial goal will cover a print run of 100 copies.\nOur Stories\nIn issue 1 of Rainbow Rodeo, you'll find...\nPersonal essays by queer country artists Sarah Shook and catherine the great \nFeatures by Jason Scott (B-Sides & Badlands, American Songwriter) and artist Paisley Fields about how queer country musicians are marketed,a feature by Mya Byrne (artist, writer for Country Queer) about Elton John's Tumbleweed Connection, and one by Rachel Cholst about the Country Music Against White Supremacy initiative\nA behind-the-scenes look at Jeremy LeRoux's short film about a closeted gay country singer, Dominant Chord \nInterviews with artists Jake Blount and Amythyst Kiah \nMusic reviews by Rachel Cholst, Annelise Domineghini (Vice, Noisey, Nylon), Eryn Brothers (Country Queer), and Sunny West\nFull-color cover by comic book artist and illustrator Luyi Bennett \nFabulous layouts by musician Bug Martin (he's multi-talented!)\nUnlocked Story #1: Karen Pittleman (of Karen and the Sorrows) on the politics of queer country music and who gets to tell our story\nUnlocked Story #2: Bluegrass musician Justin Hiltner shares his experiences with cancer, music, and recovery.\nOur Budget\nIn the interest of transparency, you can see how writers and artists are getting paid and where the costs are going on this spreadsheet. These rates are comparable to online publications, and all contributors will be given 5 copies of the zine to sell.\nThe Rewards\nYou can contribute to our project at any financial level!

My name is Mariza, artist behind Mari in the Sky. \nI am a nature-inspired illustrator, creating a hand-drawn tarot deck filled with imagery influenced by life in remote Alaska. It is touched throughout by my indigenous spiritual background. \nI draw much of my strength and inspiration from our natural environment, as it has always been my comfort and guide. I strongly believe that our mental health is very much influenced by our connection or lack of connection with our ecosystem. The art of these cards attempts to bridge the gap and remind us of the power and love found there.\nFor each pledge, I will personally contribute to the planting of two trees and 10% of total proceeds of present and future sales will be donated to ocean and climate change research. \nI very much appreciate your social media shares and your help with spreading the word about this labor of love! \nFollow me on Instagram for more art! https://www.instagram.com/mariinthesky\nPledge rewards \nAll backers receive a freebie frame-worthy art print postcard as a Thank You! \n\nInspiration \nHaving grown up with ceremony and daily rituals that connect us with the elements, songs that ancestors sang with words and sounds that speak to this connection, I am inspired to share the love, honor, and respect that our planet is due.  It is my hope that the love embedded in my work can serve as a reminder of this connection so that we may feel supported by our natural environment and also responsible for its well-being. Heal your self, heal the earth.\nFlower of Thunder inspired by the 6-year old drawing of mine displayed below. <3\nI have lived in Alaska since 2014, working on remote rivers across southwest Alaska. I collect data on wild Alaskan salmon during the summer season. One of my favorite things about this field work is that it requires living completely off-grid for periods of two to four months. This time is spent working seven days a week, monitoring rivers, enumerating and speciating salmon as they make their way to their spawning grounds. I co-exist with the bears, foxes, eagles, and all other wildlife. These remote locations are far from cell phone and internet connection. This environment provides much time for introspection, healthy soul work, and creativity. \nYoung bear at Orzinski river on the Alaskan peninsula.\nIllustrating a tarot deck had long been on my mind. I had no idea that the wave of energy behind this deck was so strong. I have witnessed my craft evolve and I have also become more in tune with the process of allowing pieces to create themselves. \nSample print in home studio. First time seeing a handful of them together! The First Edition will not have white rims.\nWorking on a tarot deck is synonymous with working on oneself. Taking up a project like this involves tearing down the walls of fear and doubt, especially, when you have never published a book, searched for manufacturers, started a crowd-funding campaign, or exposed intimate parts of yourself with a wide audience. Meditating with individual cards for days at a time and processing the meanings internally, has helped me have faith that the wave of energy inside me has a destination. Likewise, continual research and learning, reaching out to other artists with similar projects, and dedicating all of my free time to this labor of love has smoothed out the process. \nIt is my ultimate wish that this Gentle Tarot deck support and encourage others to follow their wildest dreams as it has supported and encouraged me. \nSqaure versions of the card illustrations are available as matted prints on museum quality, acid-free base, 100% cotton rag archival paper.\nIf you are new to Tarot, here\u2019s a quick how-to!\nThere are many ways to engage with tarot cards. It can be done alone or in the company of others. Generally, an intention is set or a question is asked. This can be done silently to yourself or out loud. Feel free to shuffle the deck. The cards can be spread out on a table. Choose a card at random. Use the guidebook to read about the card you chose. You can read this yourself or have your partner read it.\nPulling three cards per person is common. They can represent past, present, and future or simply add additional clarity about a single topic/question you have in mind. You will find more information about different \u2018tarot spreads\u2019 in the Gentle Tarot guidebook.\nUsing tarot cards is a fun and healthy way to engage with inner emotions and also a great way to engage in meaningful conversation.\nMay the Gentle Tarot lift your spirit and fill you with the love and support that you need. \nWild foxes roam free on Unalaska Island. They often approach you playfully as if you were also a fox. Even the ones far from town without human exposure do this. Bridging the gap for sure. Love 'em!\nThe Deck:\nThe deck is a classic 78 card deck. Some of the cards are lightly based on the Rider-Waite deck, however many of the illustrations are the result of complete surrender to creative/spiritual process. Motifs and symbols, along with colors, have been used throughout the deck to make for easy recognition and to assist with remembering the meanings of the cards.\nThe minor arcana labels have been slightly modified, Swords have become Thunder and Pentacles have become Stones.\nThe cards have color coded rims to match their element:.\nMajor Arcana - Spirit - Purple\nCups - Water - Blue\nWands - Fire - Red\nThunder - Air - Yellow\nStones - Earth - Green\n\nThe Gentle Tarot also exhibits mostly people of color. As an indigenous woman, it feels important to create work with representation because it too often is lacking in the mainstream. We should love our bodies as they are and be proud of our history and proud of whatever skin color we have.\nBrown skin representation. <3\nUnalaska tundra flowers\nDonation of 10% of proceeds:\nA lot of the creatures I use in the deck are reflective of animals we have here in Alaska, some of them being endangered species. The world is changing very quickly and I hope that we can all do our part to cause less harm.\n10% of proceeds will be donated to ocean and climate change research. I am presently researching the best avenues for this and very much look forward to being able to contribute to the health of our planet.\nPhoto taken on return flight from remote work in Kodiak. We have a beautiful planet, let's take care of it!\nTimeline:\nManufacturing of the Gentle Tarot deck and book is scheduled to begin mid-October, with final designs being submitted by the early October.\nAn overly conservative 4 weeks are allocated for print time and an additional 4 weeks are added for shipping. \nDeck/book sets are scheduled to arrive mid-December and ready to ship shortly after.\nSome hand-made reward items, such as the custom fold-over deck pouch and hand-printed items, may be delayed and available January. (But I will do all that I can to make them ready when the decks arrive!)\n March 2021 is a safety measure. Unfortunately I can't make promises, but I will do my very best to get these to you by the holidays.\nIf the hand-printed linocut items (tote bags and session cloths) are delayed for an unforeseeable reason, these items may be printed by a third party for timely delivery. \nSqaure designs available for the signed limited edition prints. The artist will work with you directly to make a square print of your desired illustration.\nCost (Updated 10/17/20):\n$23,100 cost of shipping (to myself from manufacturer) and production of deck/book set. There are a total of 79 cards (started out as 78 but we added a Bonus card!!) made with 350 gsm matte laminate paper with matte gold edges - card size 2.75\" x 4.75\" (70mm x 120mm). The book has increased in size since the inception of this kickstarter and is now at 4.75\" by 5.75\" (118mm x 144mm) with 250gsm matte laminate full color cover and recycled ivory paper inside, 196 pages total. Both will be packaged together in a two part box. \nKickstarter fees are about 10%\nEstimate increase from $2,400 to $14,750 for shipping of rewards. Shipping the deck set costs $8-$26 each, not including shipping of extra items. The new estimate is an average for 800 rewards. \nInternational shipping starts at $24. I am covering partial cost of international shipping as an attempt to not dissuade lovers of the Gentle Tarot from other parts of the world. \nEstimate cost of non-deck rewards has increased from $1,500 to $10,500 for: session cloths, tote bags, earrings, custom deck pouches, Gentle Tarot fabric for upgraded pouches, and art prints.\nSelf publishing fees: ISBN, copyright, and barcode $380\nEstimate total has increased, however the ongoing support has increased. I have been fortunate to upgrade a lot of our items and will be outsourcing the deck pouches to be sewn locally and the session clothes will be made with organic cotton (Yay to zero pesticide use!). I am also excited to offer a bigger guidebook! I thought I would have to wait until the Second Edition to be able to afford it.\nWhat a response The Gentle Tarot has had!!! THANK YOU for the love and support! I will be creating a website so that you can stay connected with The Gentle Tarot once this campaign is over. (www.thegentletarot.com) Add-on's plus other items not available here will be offered on the website!\n\nUnalaska Island, Alaska and life in the Bering Sea. This is a photo on the return from remote field camp only accessible by boat.\nPlease feel free to reach out if you have any questions or would like to make specific reward requests!\nI whole-heartedly appreciate your support in making this deck a reality.\nThank you for participating in the birth of the Gentle Tarot.\nYou can follow my work here: https://www.instagram.com/mariinthesky\nPrinting and cutting first samples in home studio\nFor as long as I can remember, I have drawn my surroundings. Here is my highly nature-influenced art at 6 years old. :) Night time on one side of the teepee and sunshine with multiple rainbows on the other. The eagle on the front has lightning bolts coming from his feet. New moon and star on drawing behind this one. My mom and I traveled to ceremony in Montana, North Dakota, and Alberta Canada during much of my childhood. Living in teepees must have prepared me well for off-grid work in Alaska.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe main challenge of this campaign is exposure. I work a full-time job, plus a part-time job and create all of my art after hours or on weekends. I am not an expert with social media or putting my work out there in the world, and I know there is risk when you don't start off with a hefty audience. \n\nI am learning how to find media outlets (online blogs, forums, and local public radio) to spread the word about my Gentle Tarot project. I hope that with my efforts, along with those of newcomers discovering my work, that together we can round up enough support to bring this deck to life.\n\nAn additional risk, which appears to be common, is if the items are not delivered on-time. Based on my schedule, they should be ready to deliver by mid-December. This is my first time embarking on a printing/publishing endeavor and I am trusting the timeline given to me by my manufacturer, plus adding additional buffer. Although I cannot make any guarantees, I will do my best to have these delivered by the holidays.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "Set of 4 Gentle Tarot Postcards!", "descp": "Receive a pack of high quality art-print postcards.

Where we live, sagas and myths have been a strong influence our entire life, and it's not strange that we fell in love with role playing! As the years passed by, we noticed how much dice could enhance how we view our characters and adventures. Dice put a face on spells, on interactions, on characters. They tell a story. And so, with our passion for sagas and our passion for dice, we are on a journey to create mythological dice!\nLast year, we held our first dice kickstarter and it went above and beyond our expectations! Now that our old kickstarter has shipped, we are ready to take on a new adventure!\nFor anyone backing for at least 1 item within the first 48 hours will recieve a free black raven coin in raised metal! \n Surtr, the J\u00f6tunn often called the lord of fire, and guardian of Muspelheim. Surtr weild a burning sword, bright as the sun itself. Myth has it, that his home Muspelheim, was so hot, that the embers flew far away and created the stars in the sky.\n\n A slumbering giant, deep inside the norse woods, maybe mistaken for a huge, mossy rock. We present, Troll! The norse trolls are depicted as a huge brown and mossy creature. They live deep inside the dark forests, because when the sun hits their skin, they turn to stone. They loved riches and collected them down in the mountain halls.\n\nSkade is the god of the snow and mountains, and so also gave name to the entire Scandinavia! There, she hunts with bow and arrow with wolves as her companions. Though once married to Njord, the god of the ocean, she couldn't stand the sound of the sea birds, and missed her mountains dearly The relationsship only lasted 9 days, but after all they met through a blind date where Skade got to choose her partner only from viewing their feet!\n\nFrej, the fertility god and protector of harvests. He is the brother of Freja but have just as much in common with his father Njord. He can traverse both sea and land with his ship, and with his boar Gyllenborste he can travel the air faster than any horse could run on land.\n\nMimir, son of Ymir, and possibly Odin's Uncle, was the guardian of Mimir's well, the fountain of wisdom. The same well Odin gave his eye for, only to drink from it's waters. In the end of the early war between Aesir and Vanir, a misunderstanding happened and the Vanir gods cut Mimir's head of. Odin kept the head from rotting by embalming it with herbs and singing galdrar in it's honor. This kept Mimir's spirit alive and the head would often give Odin sound advice.\n The Lindorm is a giant ash-white snake, often portrayed with human/drake like arms and a great flowing mane. It's long enough to bite it's own tail and you can often find a big Lindorm on norse runestones. If you were lucky enough a touch of it's skin could transfer magical abilities to you. There are many tales about the Lindorm, some say they are good, some evil. One such tale is the tale about Kind Lindorm that was a prince, turned in to a lindorm, but a amiden turned him back to his former self.\n Yggdrasil, the everlasting world tree. It's ashen branshes reaches far above the sky, and the rain that falls to our earth is dew from it's leaves. Yggdrasils roots leads to the many different realms and has to be carefully watered each day. The name Yggdrasil translates closely to: Odins horse, Ygg is another name for Odin meaning stormgod, and drasil means horse. This could either be because Valhall (Odins home) lies on top of the tree, or because he once sacrificed him self to hang by the throught in the tree for 9 days only to learn about the magical runes.\n Sleipnir is Odins loyal horse, and of course the son of Loki. Faster than the wind, he can travel both the earth, the sky and the sea. It is told that Sleipnir carries fallen heroes on his back, home to Valhall- Odins keep.\n\nFenrir, one of Loki's sons, the ultimate big bad wolf. He is said to have been raised in the iron woods as the proud wolf (the darkest and deepest of all the woods), and is the beast to finally swallow Odin at Ragnar\u00f6k. He is also father to the two wolfs Skoll and Hati (born by a witch in the iron woods). His son Skoll will be the won to swallow the sun at Ragnar\u00f6k.\n\nHeimdall, The guardian of bifrost, with amazing sight and hearing, he is keeping watch day and night. Still an aesir, he is said to have been sent down to the humans in a basket together with tools and knowledge. There, he taught the first humans about fire and handiwork.\nFun facts: he has gold teeth and as many as nine mothers! Some also say he is the son to Rans nine daugthers, the waves.\n\nSaga, the godess of stories and tales. She lives in S\u00f6kkvab\u00e4ck, where a cold, freshwater brook streams around her. There, she and Odin sits a time each day to happily drink from golden cups and share stories. She is, by all means, Odins drinking bud! She is associated with water and her knowledge like the flowing springs!\nDraugr, They live in their own, or sometimes a rich persons grave where they guard the treassure burried with the dead. Their name is more or less Ghost in old norse and they should have been followed by a stench of death and rot. They hold inhumane strength and can change their density up on will. Odin, as guardian of the dead together with Freja, was sometimes called Draugadrotten, the lord of draugr.\nDice samples are already made! No renders!\nThe dice you are seeing are all finished samples and the produced dice are expected to look similiar to those pictured! Pattern and swirls are unique for every die of course, but other than that, they will stay the same. \nEarly bird reward: If you pledge single saga or higher within the first 48 hours (before Sep 17, 5 PM Swedish time) you will recieve this beautiful exclusive raised metal Coin in black nickel finish.

The magical stave is a sort of compass that will help you find your way, even when you don't know where you are going. It's speculated if it is based on the Aegishjalmur, and also if the eight staves represent the different realms, with the middle being yggdrasil. A simplistic map if you will! To add this to your pledge, just add 526 Sek.\nRaven dice scroll: This is a scroll that will give home to 2 sets of dice and double as a roll out dice mat.

When the kickstarter ends, dice will be made within 3 -4 months, and then sent off to our supporters, CerberusSupplies and Little Dragon Corp, who will take care of all the shipping. Dice will be shipped from China and Canada, this way we save time, money and the environment.\nWe have chosen to go as environmentally friendly as possible. Therefore we won't package in the otherwise common and a bit cheaper alternative - plastic. Instead, we are having all your sets packed in hessian bags and shipped in eco friendly mailers.\nHere on kickstarter we will be giving continuous updates about the production and shipping process after the kickstarer campaign ends until all pledges are shipped!\nShipping costs will be paid after the kickstarter ends via BackerKit when all dice sets and add ons can be counted.\nThe cost will be counted as per item. Unlocked freebies won't affect this amount! Example: You have bought 2 dice sets, and paid for 1 extra add on. 3 Freebies was unlocked. Then you will only pay the 1-4 Items shipping cost, not 6.\n\nTHANK YOU!\nThis year has been absolutely crazy. A roller coaster like no other where we have been amazingly excited but also nervous for what the future holds! During this entire time you have been by our side, cheering us on and giving advice. We are so very thankful for those of you who have stuck with us and for those who have recently started to follow us and our project. It's thank to you that we can strive and continue to make our dream a reality. Our company will never be bigger than the people supporting it, and to have grown this much this past year... We are more thankful than there are dice in this world.\nWe hope that this kickstarter will be a fun event for you with magical dice and honest and good stretch goals!\nSUPPORTERS:\nCerberus supplies are an amazing company with big hearts that are doing a 10 persons job on only 2-3 people.

She has great customer service and have created many sucessful kickstarters! She always ships on time and can juggle many projects at the same time, and so we think that little dragon corp will be perfect for shipping our  US and canadian orders this time around!\nhttps://littledragoncorp.com/\nThis year we have have a dice partner! Crit Hit ceramics has helped us create these beautiful stone- rune dice. They have been amazing through the whole process and have made multiple samples for us without ever making a fuss if we needed to change something! Go and check their awesome ceramic dice!\nhttps://www.crithitceramics.com/\nThis is where it all began. The dice collecting, the love for new and exciting dice. We highly recommend that you take a look at this fantastic pillar of dice collecting and dice community!\n https://www.facebook.com/groups/DiceManiacsClub/\nThe Hoard! We all can relate to this goblin sitting inside of us just wanting more shinies. Goblin dice hoard is a wonderful and friendly place for any collector!\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/GoblinDiceHoard\nDce DB, collection and news is a great source of dice information and news and we highly recommend you follow them if you want to miss out on anything dice related :)!\nhttps://www.facebook.com/dicedb", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRisks and challenges\nAll our dice tests are already made and the dice are ready to be produced. We are using the same dice factories as in our last kickstarter since we were very happy with how they turned out, and with the friendliness of the workers!\n\nThe biggest risk with our Kickstarter, as noticed last time, is not to have the dice finished in time. They were finished long and well before shipping. But rather that we are an international kickstarter and we want to ship to anyone across the world. This makes it somewhat hard to know exactly when shipping is. Last time we added many months to our expected shipping goal, but then Covid 19 came. We can't know for certain if a second wave is coming, but we have chosen to imagine that it will not, and instead added another extra month on top of our shipping estimate.\n\nThis year we are also changing how the shipping works a little. We noticed that shipping from only one country was a little tricky. So this time we have chosen to have a separate shipping agent for the US (75% of our backers last year). We will be working with Coelette Miller from Little dragon corp, who has had amazing customer service and shipping times on her own kickstarters. She is an awesome human being, also running her own local game shop. Dice, add ons, freebies, you name it, will be sent to her. She will organize, pack and ship all the US orders. This means we can avoid delays between countries.\n\nFor the remaining countries, we will use Cerberus supplies, just like last time. They are a great company focusing on helping other creators to send their kickstarters, pack their orders, and even talk with factories and workers locally in China. We have spent many hours in skype chatting back and forth about add on designs and packaging. They have many successfull kickstarter shippings behind them and are truly passionate about what they do. We have all these skills in one place and in that way we can eliminate the risk of loosing information in transition. \n\nThey are wonderful people and have been amazingly patient with us this past year of Corona delays, and have worked so hard to help us deliver as fast as possible!\n\nAlso, this year we have made the choice to make our dice boxes with different people. We had some problems with our boxes last kickstarter, although they turned our pretty they took way longer to create than was agreed. This time we will use a more well known factory with a higher quality wood!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nSustainable materials\nThis year we have switched the leather bags for animal friendly PU/Faux leather bags, that is just as beautiful!\nEnvironmentally friendly factories\nThe factory we use take responsibility and reuse bad batches of dice for creating new, creative patterns in dice.\nSustainable Distribution\nWe will be avoding plastic envelopes and bags in our packaging.

The factory said the amount of white seems to have been a little off and caused the more orange effect. They will be available in 2-3 months.

At the time, the goal is to finish the game and make it available for Steam and Nintendo Switch. However, the possibility of porting Lonesome Village into more consoles has always been our objective.\n You can wishlist Lonesome Village now on Steam:\nWishlist Lonesome Village on Steam now\nLanguages \nThe mechanics of Lonesome Village will be reminiscent of classic RPGs, but our approach to the day-to-day interactions with different villagers and scenarios as well as life sim elements will make the game feel like a brand-new experience altogether.\nAscend the tower and solve your way to the top!\nFind yourself in dungeons that call to mind the atmosphere and quality of the 2D Zelda games.\nSolve tricky dungeon puzzles and save villagers in the tower to advance to the next chamber.  \nYou will find unique puzzles to solve for each animal friend you have to save.   \nHELP THE VILLAGE GROW - Unlock new areas and help Lonesome Village thrive through:\nExploring\nThe Village and its surroundings make up a great area to discover and explore:\nHome Customization\nWes is getting used to his new life in Lonesome, so he needs to make himself comfortable in his new house! During the game, you will find, build, and exchange many different items and objects to decorate your new home. \nFishing \nGardening \nAnd more...\nInteracting with the villagers you save from the tower will help make your life in Lonesome even more comfortable.\nCommunicating with your fellow villagers will allow you to be involved in other activities in the town, like:\nItem finding and exchange\nMore exploration\nComplete secondary assignments\nTrade Items\nAnd more...\nDay and night will play an important role in Lonesome Village. Some NPCs can only be found at night, so a significant percentage of the game will take place in the dark.\nDuring the game, you will discover different items and abilities that will help you complete all of your assignments. The \"Magic Glass\" will help you see into another reality, hidden in some objects and areas of the game. It will be a crucial object to solve some of the puzzles inside the tower. \n\nAs Wes will have much to do in town, he will discover a wide variety of items that will help him during his time in Lonesome. Once your backpack is full, you can leave some of your items at your place in the village.\nInteracting with the villagers will also help you at the time of trading items. The more happy or comfortable they're about you, they'll give a better price for sale and will pay you more for your items.\nInteracting with the villagers will make your relationship with them even better, which will also make your life in Lonesome easier as they will be nicer with you.\n\nWes is a curious coyote that has always felt a pull towards strange and mysterious things.\nOur little adventurer friend does not live in Lonesome, but he has become involved in the recent odd circumstances surrounding Lonesome and decides to make it his quest to rescue all the villagers that are trapped inside the Tower and save the village from catastrophe.\nThese are normal people (well, not quite like us, but you know) who want to help the village grow again.\nResponsible for Ubhora's disappearance. Will they try to awaken evil again?\nWe have been working really hard to create a unique aesthetic style. We want to show that every single detail of the game represents our commitment to creating a charming adventure like no other.\nThe soundtrack of the game will be created by Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 F\u00e9lix. She is a composer and sound designer that has participated in videogame projects like \"Greak: Memories of Azur\".\nDigital Rewards\nPhysical Rewards\n*Following assets are representations of what the assets will be like, the final result may vary\n\nVIP Rewards\n*Pay the shipping later! To make sure you get the best price possible, shipping fees of physical rewards will be calculated just before product delivery\n*Tiers prices are expressed in the approximately USD price, the final price may vary when the campaign ends\nFirst 100 backers who get \"Fun Pack\" Tier will receive a copy of the board game Cooking Rumble made by Emilio Estrada\nSummary of Digital Tiers and Rewards:\nSummary of Physical Tiers and  Rewards: \nSummary of VIP Tiers and Rewards: \n\nThe following Add-Ons are now available to be acquired with an extra amount on the pledge:\n Extra Steam Copy - $330 MXN (\u2248 $15 USD) \n Extra Switch Copy - $380 MXN (\u2248 $18 USD) \nDigital OST - $150 MXN (\u2248 $7 USD)\n Wes Plushie - $550 MXN (\u2248 $25 USD) *Shipping fees will be calculated just before product delivery\n Wes Pin - $200 MXN (\u2248 $10 USD) *Shipping fees will be calculated just before product delivery\n Wes Figure - $300 MXN (\u2248 $15 USD) Hand-painted *Shipping fees will be calculated just before product delivery\n Physical Comic - $200 MXN (\u2248 $10 USD) *Shipping fees will be calculated just before product delivery\n Physical Artbook - $250 MXN (\u2248 $12.5 USD) *Shipping fees will be calculated just before product delivery\n Physical OST - $250 MXN (\u2248 $12.5 USD) *Shipping fees will be calculated just before product delivery\n Sticker Pack - $200 MXN (\u2248 $10 USD) *Shipping fees will be calculated just before product deliver\n  At the time, just around 33% of the game is completed, so right after fulfilling the Kickstarter rewards for our backers, Kickstarter fees, and taxes, all funds will be used in the game itself, and they will cover the art, programming, sound & music and will allow us to properly port the game to Nintendo Switch.\nOgre Pixel is an indie studio based in Aguascalientes, Mexico since 2014. Our goal is to create fantasy stories in the form of indie video games.\nOur previous game 'Jumper Jon' became the 1st game entirely developed in Mexico for Apple Arcade\u2019s first 100 games release.\nThe experience we have gained from developing all these years has encouraged us to produce a unique experience for PC and Consoles.\nThe development of Lonesome Village has been quite slow, up until this point. Since the beginning of the production process, the game has been developed by a small fraction of the Ogre team. These points combined with a lack of funding has made finishing Lonesome Village quite challenging without support. \nThe current development advance of Lonesome Village is 1/3 of the total development plan.\nHowever, Lonesome Village has seen a lot of positive reactions from the press and on social media, which have praised the art style and the concept of the game, which motivates us to continue developing this project.\nWith your support, we can invest more time and resources into finishing the development of our game. We\u2019re committed to bringing the world of Lonesome Village to life, but we can\u2019t do it without you!\nStay updated with our development! We\u2019ll continue to share important updates on our social media channels:\n  E-mail: ogrepixel@gmail.com\nOur goal is to create a unique experience for those who love to challenge their minds and are always looking for something new to enjoy, that\u2019s why this game needs all of the team\u2019s attention.\nThe development process is complicated, especially for all the features we want to include in the game, which is why the required budget has increased to a point where we need the help of people who want to be part of such a special experience that we know our game can be.\nFortunately, the studio was able to keep operating in spite of the ongoing challenges which came with COVID-19. This allowed us to continue our commitment to finish the development of this charming game.\nThanks for taking the time to check out our Kickstarter campaign.

Together with A Fond Banishment, it forms a bookend to the collection, both tales exploring folklore about how devils and evil spirits were summoned and banished.\nA page from A Fond Banishment\nA page from A Devil Upon The Wires\nA Devil Upon The Wires is a short horror story based on a nightmare. Have you ever woken up in the night with a feeling like there is something wrong? Like someone was in the room just a moment before you opened your eyes? Maybe the devil on the wires was there, just a moment before you woke.\nA page from A Beached Devil\nA Beached Devil is a story of the strange things that wash up on remote beaches. Drawing on my childhood in the Highlands of Scotland, it tells the story of an isolated fishing community that finds a creature washed up on the beach, and takes it home. Are the riches in the depths of the sea worth the price?\nBlock print title page of Greeting A Devil\nGreeting a Devil  is a story about being seen. A woman feels invisible, lives on the margins of a world not built for her, inhabited by people who never have to think about her existence. Until she meets a charming gentleman who suggests that there is power in living on the edges of society, and encourages her to learn a new skill.\nA page from Greeting a Devil\nA page from The Stoneymollan Devil\nThe StoneyMollan Devil is based on a real place - Stoneymollan coffin road runs up over the hills between Balloch, a small town on the shores of Loch Lomond, and St Mahew's chapel in Kirkton. I've walked this path many times, and its fascinating history and beautiful, varied scenery seemed perfect for a spooky story about walking alone over the hills.\nThe Book...\nThe book will be A5 size, 60 pages including a cover, full colour throughout. As the project is funding super well, I'm also looking at some stretch goals, to improve the book and add other things, see below for details of those as we approach them!\nFor a few years I\u2019ve been using Inktober as an opportunity to improvise stories, and last year I wanted to incorporate block printing as well as just drawing in ink. The old-fashioned, starkly contrasting images produced by traditional block printing seemed very well suited to stories inspired by the many folk tales of the devil we have in the UK, so I decided to do a block print to start each week, as the cover to an illustrated story about a different devil. By the end of the month I had five stories I loved, and I knew they would make a great book all tied together. It took four months of work on additional art, polishing, and reworking, with several of the stories expanded and reworked, and one entirely new story (A Fond Banishment, to mirror An Invitation to a Devil at the start of the book), and now I have the full 60-page book ready to print. That\u2019s where you can help out!\n...And Other Rewards\nAs well as the book itself (available in both digital pdf and physical form) I wanted to put together some extra rewards to show off the art created for the book, and expand upon the devilish themes. Different reward tiers can pick up these rewards as well as the book itself!\n A piece of original art depicting a one-of-a-kind devil of your very own! Available both as a physical reward, hand drawn in ink on beautiful Khadi paper if you pick the Stygian tier, and also as a digital-only version on the Fiendish tier, still unique but sent as a high res print-ready file, so that backers abroad can get something really special without having to pay shipping costs!\n The chicken's foot print seemed perfect as an emblem on some magical item, and what better vehicle for it than a notebook you can keep your own spells and secrets in! Printed in copper foil onto an A6 notebook, with decorated inside covers and a space for you to write your name!\nA page from Flower Knights\nAnother page from Flower Knights\n Flower Knights is a collection of short stories about knights who are also wildflowers! Drawing on the folklore of wild plants and on the fairy tales I grew up on, I wanted to write stories about knights who were more than strong men slaying monsters and rescuing damsels. Some of these knights slay monsters, some rescue damsels, but they are not all men, not all interested in winning riches, and don't all use violence to solve their problems. They are based on weeds, and so they grow in strange shapes to survive in a strange world. Fully illustrated throughout, this is a cute little square book that forms a great accompaniment to Devilry.\n A collection of A5 print reproductions of all the blocks I used to illustrate this book, including the cover!\nReward Tiers\nThere are 7 reward tiers to choose from, plus a special early bird offer during the first week!\nStretch Goals\nThis project has been so much more successful than I dared hope already! I've put together some stretch goals to improve the book and add special extras for supporters!\n\u00a33000 - UNLOCKED! Extra stories in the book!\nAt \u00a33000 I'll add 6 micro-stories to the book! 2 single-page stories, and 4 2-page spreads, each with illustrations in block print or traditional ink, whichever works best for the story. Please note that this reward does mean a slight delay in production of the book from my original estimates. I now expect to start shipping rewards from January 2021.\n \u00a33500 - UNLOCKED! Familiar sticker set!\nAt \u00a33500 I'm adding a set of stickers to the Familiar tier and up! The 6 stickers are familiar themed - each is a spooky little animal to help with your magical antics! Here are the designs (subject to minor change before printing):\n(Note the fiendish tier will get a digital version of the stickers, to print out and keep or decorate online profile pages etc!)\n\u00a34000 - UNLOCKED! Original print artwork!\nAt \u00a34000 backers at Infernal and Stygian tiers will get a piece of original print artwork added into their rewards! ALSO I'm adding the virtual sticker set to the Impudent tier, so if you get the book in digital form it'll come with the set of little familiars!\n\u00a35000 - to be unlocked\nAbout Me\nHi, I'm Letty, a Glasgow-based small toad making comics and illustration that tends to focus on cycles of nature and all things unsettling and beautiful. I've been making books and comics for about 5 years, including a Scottish Independent Comic book Award winning graphic novel A Stranger Came to Town.

I have left extra time on the production estimates to allow for any issues around that, and the design part of the rewards is all done and ready to go, minimising lead time on production as much as possible. The only rewards that will need any time to create on my part are the unique devils, and I've limited availability accordingly and set realistic fulfillment schedules to complete these.\nThe unpredictability of shipping within the UK seems to be easing for now, but obviously is still subject to variation as lockdown restrictions vary. Overseas shipping is likely to face delays, and increases in shipping costs. I have done my best to account for this in my stated shipping costs, but understand that this is an unprecedented and unpredictable situation, and will keep everyone posted via updates as I get to shipping out rewards.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a35 or more", "title": "Be Impudent", "descp": "A digital copy of the book.\nINCLUDES:\npdf copy of Devilry", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2020"}], "stat": ["20 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a310 or more", "title": "Be Demonic", "descp": "Get a physical copy of the book, and also a digital copy.\nINCLUDES:\nPhysical copy of Devilry\npdf copy of Devilry", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Feb 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["14 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a315 or more", "title": "Be Familiar", "descp": "Get the physical book and pdf plus a matching notebook.\nINCLUDES:\nPhysical copy of Devilry\npdf copy of Devilry\nNotebook", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Feb 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["16 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a320 or more", "title": "Be Fiendish", "descp": "A digital copy of the book plus a unique devil to go with it!\nINCLUDES:\nUnique devil drawing (digital)\npdf copy of Devilry", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Apr 2021"}], "stat": ["0 backers", "Limited (50 left of 50)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a320 or more", "title": "Be Diabolical", "descp": "Get the book and notebook, plus Flower Knights, a book of illustrated short stories about wildflower knights.\nINCLUDES:\nPhysical copy of Devilry\npdf copy of Devilry\nNotebook\nFlower Knights book", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Feb 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["46 backers", "Limited (14 left of 60)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a330 or more", "title": "Be Infernal", "descp": "Everything above, plus a set of 7 prints featuring the block print designs from the book!\nINCLUDES:\npdf copy of Devilry\nPhysical copy of Devilry\nNotebook\nFlower Knights book\nset of 7 prints", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Feb 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["7 backers", "Limited (23 left of 30)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a340 or more", "title": "Be Stygian", "descp": "Everything mentioned above, plus your own unique devil ink drawing.\nINCLUDES:\npdf copy of Devilry\nPhysical copy of Devilry\nNotebook\nFlower Knights book\nUnique devil drawing (physical)\nset of 7 prints", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Apr 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["25 backers", "Limited (15 left of 40)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a37 or more", "title": "Be Demonic (Early Bird!)", "descp": "Get a physical copy of the book- with a discount!

I am an artist, a lover of art, a lover of astrology, a tarot card reader, a crystal collector, and a believer that if you do anything with passion and love, it will not only inspire others, but it will help make the world a more beautiful place.\nPLAY\n\n(A heartfelt thank you to all of you beautiful souls in this video below).\nPLAY\n\nIn June of 2020, my dream to design and publish my own tarot deck came true. With the help of the most beautiful backers, my Kickstarter campaign was funded and is currently being fulfilled. I call my deck the Destiny Deck.\nDuring my campaign, I talked about another dream I had, to publish a beautiful tarot companion treasury. I am thrilled to introduce this to you right now.\nI CREATED A BOOK...and I am offering it to you! 260 pages of beautifully designed pages.\nThe Tarot Treasury is intended for anybody to use, not only people who have purchased the Destiny Deck tarot.  This treasury is filled with beautiful illustrations, photographs, and explanations of the meanings behind the Major and Minor Arcana cards in Tarot. Each page is created with love and an artwork within itself.  \nAs an intuitive tarot reader, I believe we all have the gift to understand our story through the art of tarot.  Now, I want to share the knowledge I have gained throughout the years and allow you to gain an understanding of Tarot through this treasury so that the practice of interpreting and understanding tarot can become more approachable.\nFrom a page in The Tarot Treasury\nThis book is also intended for the well-versed Tarot reader. It is a treasury that can be used to keep notes and insights in. There are pages for your own interpretations, notes, and ideas.\nEvery Page is designed with the highest degree of detail\nThe Destiny Deck\nThe Tarot Treasury is created and produced with the highest attention to detail.  Every page is created as its own composition. The finest gold foil has been sourced for the cover art. The superior heavy-weight cover is crafted with a superior, beautiful and sensual satin-velvety feel to the touch.  This texture mimics the texture of a rose petal, as well as the Destiny Deck tarot card itself. This book feels amazing to hold and it is a perfect compliment to the Destiny Deck tarot cards. The book is a landscape format 10\u201d x 8\u201d and it consists of over 260 pages of wisdom on the finest heavy weight paper.\nAreas where you can write your own notes. This is a compendium of Wisdom that you can contribute to.\nEach spread has brought about information that has been beneficial for my clients and for myself. SO I wanted to include these beautiful tools for you.\nThis is the treasury that I have had endless visions of creating, and I feel so much gratitude for you in helping me manifest this long-awaited dream.  I cannot wait to get The Tarot Treasury and the positive energy it contains into your hands.\nMost of all, The Tarot Treasury was created with you in mind.\nIt was created with love and the belief any positive encouragement can help us walk forward in our journey towards our purpose.\nWith only love in mind, The Tarot Treasury is my passion project, and I am honored to offer it to the world. Thank you for believing in my work. I know you will love it as much as I do.\nI am sending you all so much love.\nLisa, xx\nAllow the Universe to lead the way in order to reconnect with the love within ourselves.

The pictures themselves are anecdotal - narrative miniatures - and like pieces of music, they hold moments and memories.\nI \"The Juggler\" / \"Anecdotes\"\nThe basis of this deck is Joanna Newsom's music, which like Tarot elicits obsessive diving and pattern-seeking. The narrators of Newsom's songs are archetypal in the same was as the figures of the Tarot trumps. I began in Autumn 2018 with an idle sketch combining Trump IX (Time, or The Hermit) with the song \"Soft As Chalk,\" and other connections gradually revealed themselves. The result is not a literal or definitive interpretation, but my personal response to both the music and the characters of the cards.\nIX \"Time\" / \"Soft As Chalk\"\nThe purpose of this Kickstarter is to raise funds to print copies of the deck. All art is completed, all that remains is to see how many people actually want a copy!\n\nEvery card in this deck is inspired by a specific lyric, or a song as a whole. \nThe 22 trumps follow the sequence of our old friend, the Tarot de Marseille. The imagery in all the cards has been inspired by other historic Tarots, such as the Sola Busca deck, the \"Mantegna Tarocchi,\" and the decks of the Etteilla school. The songs of the trumps span the entire discography. \n\"Wheel of Fortune\" / \"Sapokanikan\" incorporates a design from the so-called Mantegna series\nSome depict characters mentioned in songs, such as Monkey (XV) or Colleen (XVII). Others show an imagined narrator of the song. For each, the song has provided a landscape to fit the Tarot character into, whether they are a costumed character of the song or its narrator. \nThe trumps: The Fool, The World (flanked by the card-back design) // The Juggler, The Popess, The Empress, The Emperor // The Pope, Love, The Chariot, Justice // Time, The Wheel of Fortune, Fortitude, The Hanged One // Death, Temperance, The Devil, The Tower // The Stars, The Moon, The Sun, Judgement\nEach of the other four suits is based on one specific album, with added seasonal and elemental themes. The cards are mostly scenic, but do not follow any one model for illustrated cards. The sequence of each suit was chosen by combining the numerical readings of the Tarot with the story of each album, resulting in a hybrid of the two sources.\nThe Ace of Batons\nThe suit of Batons is based on the album The Milk-Eyed Mender, set at the end of summer and associated with the element Fire. These cards all focus on arts, crafts, and the natural world. \nThe 14 cards of the suit of Batons / The Milk-Eyed Mender\n\nThe Ace of Coins\n The suit of Coins is based on Have One On Me, set as autumn turns toward winter and associated with the element Earth. These cards deal with possessions, homelands, and belonging.\nThe Ace of Swords\nThe suit of Swords is based on Divers, set at the end of winter and associated with elemental Air. These cards share themes of individualism, remembrance, and intellectual conflicts.\nThe Ace of Cups\nThe suit of Cups is based on Ys, set in late spring and early summer and associated with elemental Water. These cards deal with community, family, and passions.\nThe cards will measure 4 inches by 6 inches, and will be printed on 330gsm cardstock. Close to the size of the original artwork (about 5x8\"), this extra-large card size displays as much detail as possible.\nComparison of giant prototype deck with a bridge-sized playing card. They are G I A N T.\nThe 78 card pictures, card backs, and borders were all drawn by hand using alcohol markers and colored pencils. I worked on this deck from 2018 to 2020. When I started, this medium was almost foreign to me, but after drawing and re-drawing many of the pictures I've learned a lot.\nThe card backs have an image of a cameo harp with foliage lovingly lifted from one of my favorites,  The Unicorn in Captivity.\nPrototype card back design\nThere are no titles on the cards - they are marked only with numbers and/or symbols. Each of the five suits has a unique border to allow them to be easily distinguished, and complement the color palette of each image.\nThe four Kings (clockwise from top left: Swords, Coins, Batons, Cups). The court cards are marked with chess notation.\n The tuck box design features birds who appear throughout the deck... except, a cuckoo? How'd he get in there? \nPart of the tuck box design\nEvery tier includes the 78-card deck with printed tuck box. I am writing a small guidebook which will be sent as a PDF file. For this campaign, I want to prioritize printing the decks rather than adding the cost of printing booklets, so this guide will be digital only. However, it will be formatted to be the same size as the cards (4x6\"), if you'd like to print it yourself.\nThe funding goal covers the cost of printing 100 decks, 100 tuck boxes, estimated shipping costs, and taxes and fees. \nThe estimated delivery is December 2020. If the project is funded, once I receive the funds the order will be placed with the printer in October, and I will begin shipping as soon as I receive them.\nThe other rewards may include . . . \nPrints. I will get a print of the picture of your choice from a local photo shop. Prints will be 5x7\" (approximately the size of original drawings). I will ask your preference in a survey after the project has been funded, and I plan to mail the prints at the same time as the decks. You can choose any card, or even one of the \"outtakes\" from the deck, if you've been following along! All images are posted on Instagram under #joannanewsomtarot. The estimated delivery for prints only is November, as I don't have to wait for these to be shipped to me.\nArt commission. A 5x7\" drawing in the same media and style as the deck, subject is up to you! Since this is made-to-order, this will most likely ship later than the decks.\nEmbroidered card case. An embroidered and hand-stitched polyester felt case for the deck - you can give me direction on the design. Polyester felt is durable and holds its color well, but if your taste in materials is more highbrow, I can use wool felt. Again, these will take time to create, and will most likely ship later than the deck itself. \nHere are some examples of cases I created for other decks.\nAbout shipping: Shipping costs are estimated based on current rates for USPS First Class Package Service. I am not offering to ship prints alone outside the US, as the rate is more than what I'd charge for the print! I learned from my last deck that certain countries, including Italy and Germany, have restrictions on receiving playing cards in the mail from the US. Please be aware of this if you're from one of these countries - if you're interested in the deck, I hope that we can work that out.\n\nNote: This is a personal project and not officially affiliated with Joanna Newsom in any way. \n\nThank you for reading, and if you have any questions feel free to send me a message or comment!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAll of the art for the deck is completed, so any risks will occur in manufacture and distribution.\nThe biggest risk is the possibility of international shipping restrictions from COVID-19.

Could the world really be as bad as her parents say? Can she find the courage to step outside, to find the truth?\nFirst, it was just curiosity.

Each card was carefully researched, designed, and illustrated to allow for both depth of symbolism as well as quick precision in your readings, all while still depicting the grim elegance of its supernatural motif.\nEach card is drawn in a red, black and white color scheme that keeps the whole deck unified in one consistent look and feel. The characters in the deck are a diverse cast that bring to life the varied beauty of the setting and its inhabitants. Every card meaning has a considered mediation between its different sources and as such you will see a melding of traditions. \nPips are fully illustrated with depictions of people and backgrounds like a RWS deck, but also contain symbolism and designs inspired by the Thoth deck, and titles inspired from both the Golden Dawn and Thoth. Meanings of cards follow the three sources, so where one differs from the other two, the more common meaning is applied. Cards ask you to read energy and themes and aren't tied to following specific gender expressions. The characters within are varied in their bodies, races, ages, sexual orientations, and genders (yes, even and especially the court cards, which despite their naming, follow no specific gender expression). \nCards are planned for two sizes and price points, but both have the same quality card stock and imagery.  The standard Tarot size of 2.75x4.75\" and pocket edition size of 2.2\"x3.43\" are both printed on master quality linen card stock with black core and matte coating, intended for durability, vibrant image reproduction, and ease of handling/shuffling. Each standard size deck is housed in a custom-labelled tin designed to provide protection and longevity even while you\u2019re on the go, and comes with a booklet for quick reference. The pocket edition comes in a textured matte tuck box which provides a quick housing with a decent amount of protection at an affordable price.\nThe two card sizes\nQuality linen cardstock with matte coating makes for easy shuffling even with the larger deck\nEvery card was designed to read visually at a glance, even with the smaller size, while still containing a depth of occult symbolism drawn from their source decks. Information on how to use this deck will be available for all skill levels! A free PDF download will be available on the website for all to reference, so if you're just beginning, don't feel intimidated, as you should have an accessible starting point! For the standard deck, a guide booklet for on-the-go reference will come with the deck and fit within the tin. Those that already have knowledge of Thoth and RWS traditions will have extra context and flavor with this deck, but that knowledge isn't necessary to get started using this deck.\nLost Hollow Altar Cloth design. To be printed on 21x21\" 100% cotton, large enough for a Celtic Cross Spread, Small enough to wrap the deck up in!\nThe Major Arcana\nWands\nCups\nSwords\nPentacles\n \"Night is the mother of counsels.\" - George Herbert\nTarot decks appeal to different people for different purposes. Some just like having an artistic collectible. Others use them for card games like Tarrochini. Some use them for occult purposes and divination. Others use them for self-reflection and self-improvement work. Whatever your usage is, my hope is that this deck will serve you well. \nHere you will find all cards fully illustrated with a rich and diverse cast of characters. I've tried my best to depict them with beauty and grace, but also with just a hint of horror and the macabre. Despite the dark setting, the contents of the deck read with the variety of light and dark themes and archetypes you'd expect from a Tarot deck. Bonus cards of Justice and Strength, each with their own unique artwork, let you choose whether you'd like them numbered according to the Rider-Waite-Smith standard or the Crowley-Harris/GD one. This brings the total card count up to 80, although you'll likely still only use 78 at once.\nFunding after the initial goal helps me to recover unexpected  costs, provide better product, and cement further campaigns in the future. As I\u2019ve managed with previous campaigns, my goal with this one is to provide fast fulfillment and shipping after the funding period.\nShould we fund, I\u2019m looking forward to offering these additional rewards:\n$8000 - UNLOCKED - Kickstarter specific Death card! Every deck  will ship with a bonus Kickstarter specific Death card printed just for  this campaign.\nKickstarter Exclusive Death Card\n$9500 - UNLOCKED - Lost Hollow Sticker pack. Included with every physical reward level!\nLost Hollow Logo Sticker\nLost Hollow Red Eye Sticker\nLost Hollow Crow Sticker\n$12,000 - UNLOCKED - Lost Hollow soft enamel pin. Included with every physical reward level!\nLost Hollow Soft Enamel Pin Mockup\n$30,000 - UNLOCKED - Limited print run - Signed letterpress printed mini Lost Hollow art prints included with every physical reward tier! \nThis campaign has a higher goal than my previous ones due to printing two different sizes of decks and the higher quality linen card stock. Out of the goal of $7000, funds are estimated to be allocated accordingly:\nEstimated shipping costs - 20% ($1400)\nEstimated Kickstarter+other fees - 10% ($700)\nEstimated production costs for the decks, boxes, booklets, and altar cloths - 70% ($4900 + personal funds added)\nThis timeline is an estimate based on past campaigns, not a guarantee, but each of my  previous campaigns have seen backer rewards sent out within a very short  time frame and I hope to continue that trend with this one. My goal is  to get the majority of decks (if not all of them) shipped in time for  the holidays. This estimate is assuming a similar amount of interest as previous campaigns. Should we fund, the timeline looks like this:\nOctober 2020: The campaign ends and Kickstarter begins collecting pledge money. I\u2019ve finished work on the  stretch goals as we hit them and have digital files ready to send to the printers as soon as the campaign completes. Digital rewards are sent out as soon as pledges lock down (usually a week after the campaign).\nLate October- Late November 2020:  Money is transferred to my account (usually 2 weeks after the campaign  ends) at which point I\u2019m able to place orders for all of the separate items. Decks should begin shipping by late October to late November.\nDecember 2020: I will continue shipping product to backers with the goal of getting it into your hands by the holidays.\nJanuary 2021: Except for multiple unforeseen delays or drastically long overseas shipping factors beyond my control, backers should have their rewards by now. Be sure to fill out your backer report as soon as possible to get your rewards in time!\nHello pals! I\u2019m James, and Pixel Occult is the name I\u2019ve  been working under for over six years now. I\u2019ve completed (with all  stretch goals met or exceeded) four Kickstarter Campaigns. Two of those were Tarot Decks based on the RWS, titled the Sinking Wasteland Tarot and the Neon Moon Tarot, respectively. The third was a cutesy cryptid  oracle deck, the Adorabyssal Oracle, which funded two years ago. Last year was the Wayward Dark Tarot, based on the Crowley-Harris Thoth deck.\nI\u2019ve been running an Etsy shop since 2016 and my reviews consistently note my shipping speed and product quality, among other very nice and  wonderful things that this community is kind enough to praise me with.\nI am an indie creator whose decision making process doesn\u2019t include  target audiences and market research, but rather starts with an idea of  something that I\u2019d like to see exist in the world. Thanks to all of the  incredible supporters out there, I\u2019m able to continue making my dark, odd, and fun projects. I truly can't think of anything I'd rather be doing than researching, designing, and drawing these wonderful decks and I'm so pleased to have the enthusiastic response that I've had for my creations from this community!\nThis particular deck started out as event posters for our local witchy market here in Portland called Market Obscura, and each one was designed to be a Tarot card eventually. I started making these while I was researching the Crowley-Harris Thoth tradition for my Wayward Dark deck, and I ended up blurring the RWS and Thoth symbolism together in the posters. Then it became a personal task to research and design these together with the Golden Dawn, split out pieces that I liked from each, and then re-assemble them together into something new. I am quite pleased with the result, and I hope that they will perform as well for you in your readings as they have for me in mine!\nIntro video music:\nSong: The Chase\nArtist: Karl Casey @ White Bat Audio\nWebsite: https://whitebataudio.com/ \nImages represent prototypes in progress. Final products may differ. Slight revisions to existing artwork are expected.\nI do offer worldwide shipping but I\u2019m sorry to say that I have little  control over shipping costs or customs fees. What I charge is what it costs me to ship, and unfortunately prices seem to have gone up in the past year. If you order from outside of the US, please be aware that I\u2019ve done my best to keep weights down, prices affordable, and  shipping tracked. Even with all of my precautions, some things are  simply beyond my control. \nFinally, a big thank you to all of the backers, friends, strangers,  and fellow internet oddities whose enthusiasm and support continues to allow projects like this to exist and thrive.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is a low risk campaign for backers. I typically ship product through my Etsy store 5-6 days a week and even with current delays effecting the Postal Service, packages still generally arrive within a reasonable time frame. \n\nI have prototypes of decks, boxes, and booklets in hand and arrangements for other product already underway. All artwork is completed(minus stretch goals, to be completed as we hit them) and ready to send to the printers. I plan to complete writing the book/booklet during the campaign and have it ready well before the campaign completes.\n\nFor my previous Kickstarter campaigns and my Etsy store, I have repeatedly received feedback for fast shipping, sturdy packaging, and satisfaction with the product.\n\nShould we fund, I am ready to commit myself (and some helpful recruits if necessary) full time to fulfilling orders and getting product out the door as quickly as possible. It is my goal with this campaign to repeat the speed of shipping and delivery that I\u2019ve maintained in my previous campaigns and Etsy store.\n\nThank you for checking out this campaign!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "Digital Reward Pack", "descp": "Complete pack of all digital rewards featuring custom avatar images, HD wallpapers, and the PDF booklet for The Lost Hollow Tarot\nINCLUDES:\nWallpaper and Avatar Pack\nLost Hollow PDF Booklet", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2020"}], "stat": ["17 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 27 or more", "title": "Lost Hollow Pocket Edition", "descp": "One pocket edition Lost Hollow Tarot deck with custom tuck box.

I know a big swath of campaigns go with Backerkit to help them keep track of rewards, but I've not dug into that particular source yet and so far have fulfilled all my previous campaigns using Kickstarter's tools. That doesn't mean Backerkit is out, but that right now it's not part of the plan.\nAnd so far my plan has kept me in a place able to fulfill rewards as quickly as possible, so I'm hesitant to add more complexity to the mix. To that end, I'd like to ask that if you want an add-on, DM me about what you'd like. For a quick idea of what I can add on, most anything from is fair game, or if you're after a booklet and only wanted the smaller deck, or if you're an early bird backer but still want a reading/altar cloth(or maybe a second deck) let me know and we can make that happen. Art prints aren't likely at the moment, as my print shop for those is currently closed down from the pandemic/fires and I don't think they'll be back in action in time for rewards to ship out. As far as what to expect for the process, I'll have you bump your pledge amount up by the amount of the cost of the additional item, plus any differences in shipping costs that come with adding extra size and weight to a package. This is how I've taken care of things in the past and (as far as I know) I'm batting 100% on it.

It\u2019s a book to help children understand what allergies are and how to deal with them. It also comes with a cookbook with recipes that are healthy and allergy friendly.\nBEHIND THE STORY\n I had never heard nor had to deal with allergies in my life till we got our first daughter. Just like Huppy we started to discover bit by bit about her allergies. In the beginning it wasn\u00b4t hard to adapt to her new diet but when she became older and when the birthday parties, day-care and other social events started, that was when things started to become complicated. \nHow do you explain to a 3-year-old, she can\u2019t eat the cake or all the nice food and sweets that\u00b4s on the table? As a parent with a child with allergies, you feel the pain that your child can\u2019t participate like all the other children but also the fear that she might eat something she isn\u2019t supposed to.\nThat\u2019s why I came up with a children\u2019s book to explain what allergies through a story they can relate to. The cookbooks come along with easy allergy friendly recipes to help children look for alternatives and to show that limitations are just the beginning of creativity.\nWith the books I hope to help as many families and children that have to face allergies everyday and to make people aware of the issue.\n I created a prototype for the books with all the illustrations and cover designs. Only the text needs to be edited\n The cookbook is a trilogy that comes in three separate books; breakfast, lunch and dinner. Each one is divided into different categories no eggs, no gluten, no nuts and no lactose. It also comes with a substitute list of ingredients that is nice to hang up in the kitchen. The cookbooks are downloadable and the recipes can be easily printed out. The recipes come from different families with a small story about their lives.\n\n\nWHO IS IT FOR?\nThe book and the cookbooks are suitable for all kids and adults. This is the perfect gift to comfort children with allergies, to make people aware about the issue and to show that healthy and allergy friendly food can be fun to!\nWHY IT\u00b4S SO IMPORTANT\nAllergy is the most common chronic disease in Europe. The current prediction is that by 2025 more than 50% of all Europeans will suffer from at least one type of allergy, with no age, social or geographical distinction.\n Most allergic conditions start in childhood and disproportionately affect children and teenagers, making the chance of a severe allergic reaction during school hours high, yet teachers are often not informed or prepared for such events.  \nStudies showed that implementation of public communication and awareness-raising campaigns, helps patients\u2019 reduce attacks, costs and treatments. (Source: EAACI)\nPLAY\n\nAltough COVID-19 has had some positive affect on children with food allergies, in a way that social events have been limited. Now schools are reopening and it\u2019s more important than ever to bring the subject up. Not just because of food allergies but also for the children that suffer from respiratory allergies. Coughs and sneezes can easily be mistaken for Coronavirus and children could be the victim of false accusations for being corona carriers.\nSOME NEWS STORIES \nhttps://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-london-53990961\nhttps://www.thesun.co.uk/news/9531778/allergy-anaphylaxis-natashas-law/\n\nTHE AUTHOR AND ILLUSTRATOR\nEline is the creator behind  \u00b4Huppy Naturals\u00b4.

It is associated with the bittersweet memory of missing something or someone, while being grateful of that/ their existence.\u201d\nThe HIRAETH  art anthology brings together the talents and imagination of 28 dedicated artists.\nI\u2019ve always been fascinated by spaces, and the lives we choose to make in them, and the intersection of the magical and the mundane. Inspired by the Welsh concept of hiraeth, or the Portuguese saudade, or the Romanian dor, this anthology was created with home in mind. Included in this book are a myriad of locations - real, imagined, and something in between - inspired by the artist's memories, narratives, and stories.\nThe final book will be a 6\"x9\" (roughly A5) matte softcover with over 50 pages of full-color, spread & single page artwork. Perfect bound, the softcover book will also feature a cover from Bex Glendining (@lgions on twitter). \nAJ AZUTILLO / ALEXANDRA \"LEXXY\" DOUGLASS / ASHANTI FORTSON / ASHLEIGH DAVIS / CAMERON LUCENTE / CARI CORENE / CAROLINE DOUGHERTY / CHRISTINA QI / CIEL BAHENA / CORI WALTERS / C.R.

The reward tiers were also adjusted slightly \u2014 both to give people more variety in reward bundles, and to also lower the price a bit so more people can afford HIRAETH in today's current global economy. We also have some new graphics! Yay! \nMost importantly, however, the artists came forward and agreed to a pay cut to see this book get printed, and it's my dearest wish that we not only get funded, but reach at least our first stretch goal to pay all of the wonderful and talented artists what they deserve. \nProduction costs cover everything from printing the physical book to manufacturing the enamel pins to creating the print sets for this anthology. Note that the rewards shown above are not the final, physical product \u2014 these are design mock-ups but they are as close to the final product as humanly possible. \nThe remainder of the funds will go towards paying Kickstarter's transaction fees, Stripe's fees, taxes, and other miscellaneous transaction fees.\nAs before, each subsequent stretch goal will also include a payment increase for all involved artists. Each artist will be paid based on their chosen type of illustration, with an additional payout for artists who also contributed merchandise for this anthology.  My main goal in starting HIRAETH was to ensure as large of an artist payout as possible, but I need your support and consideration to make this anthology a reality.\n REWARD TIERS:\n SPECIAL TIERS:\nAlong with the standard tiers above, and the commission tiers below, HIRAETH is also proud to offer two special tiers for your consideration: \n MORNING TEA (EARLY BIRD TIER): Get it fast, and get it cheap(er)! The Early Bird Tier includes the full book and merch bundle you'll find in the Oolong Tea tier, but at a reduced price. Strike while the iron's still hot, as this tier is only available until August 16th. \n HOME IS WHERE THE HEART IS TIER: Sometimes it just doesn't feel like home without someone to share it with. This tier includes a bundle of (2) Oolong Tea sets: one for you, and one for a loved one. Note that this tier includes all digital and physical rewards (books, bookplates, pins, etc).\nSHIPPING:\nShipping will be handled by White Squirrel, a small company just north of Seattle that specializes in online store management for independent artists, as well as bulk fulfillment for pre-orders, shops, and crowdfunded campaigns. They work with authors, designers, artists, and all types of creatives to consolidate, package, and ship their products.\nWhite Squirrel has worked with a myriad of talented creators, since 2019, for ongoing fulfillment, bulk fulfillment, and store management and comes highly recommended by the community. They will be shipping direct from the US. You can find more information on who they are and what they do HERE.\nHIRAETH is proud and excited to have White Squirrel as a fulfillment partner for this campaign.\nSTRETCH GOALS:", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAll art for this anthology is complete, so all that's left is to fund the production and shipping costs!

Food is a crucial part of the lifestyle and some people follow a strict diet for various reasons. It is difficult to find the food they like especially in gatherings for people with strict diets or allergies. I wanted to create memorable experiences for people and create an opportunity for anyone to eat the same sweets. Crystal Treats are made to share.  \n Crystal Treats comes inside of the \u201cjewelry box,\u201d and opening this box is part of the luxury experience. Once you open the box, picturesque edible crystals will be revealed and it is time to enjoy those delicious crystals! We offer 5-piece and 8-piece box.   \n5pcs box\n8pcs box\nWe offer 8 unique flavors of Crystal Treats. For anyone to enjoy, Misaky.Tokyo fuses sweets with global food culture. We use lavender from Europe, mango from Asia, Hibiscus from Latin America, Rose from the Middle East, Match from Japan, and so on. By gathering different flavors from around the world in one box, anyone would feel nostalgia and peace of mind. \nJapanese sweets, also known as \u201cWagashi\u201d , are traditionally served with Matcha at the tea ceremony. As part of the tea ceremony philosophy, no matter what their station is, people are treated equally inside the tearoom. This is how we came up with the idea of equality.   \nWe will provide an unforgettable experience with sweets and create social equality. Our goal is to make our customers happy with our Crystals.   \n About the Founder\nFounder: Alissa Miky\n When the founder Alissa Miky was 9 year-old, she experienced 9/11. Just three days later, her family was waiting at JFK airport to fly back to Japan. She could remember vividly, the cold feeling sitting on the floor at the airport. They were waiting to get onto a plane not unlike the ones that had caused so much pain just days before. She was scared. A tiny bit of solace came when a Red Cross worker appeared in front of her and gave her a small piece of candy and she felt a sense of safety. This is the moment she looked back and made her feel recreating this feeling to others. \nBusiness Insider Japan \"Game Changer\" 2019 Alissa in red dress\n Years later in Japan, despite having a level of success in the marketing field that garnered recognition from both Forbes and Business Insider, she still felt empty inside. She was talking with her friend, she was sad to hear about how her friend often couldn't find many good treats to eat. She follows a vegan diet and has Celiac disease, keeping her from also consuming gluten products. \n This all sparked a thought...Most Japanese desserts are vegan, gluten-free and beautiful; the desserts might be able to replicate that feeling of comfort she had experienced years earlier. She felt that I could not only create a dessert but a feeling of happiness and a better, safer world.\n(exclude shipping)\nHere are the flavors that come with for 8 piece box \n8 pcs box\nHere are the flavors that come with for 5 piece box\n5 pcs box\nWhy Kickstarter? \nThe fund is going to be used to expand the kitchen space to increase productivity.\nThank you for supporting Misaky.Tokyo and we hope to bring you joy with our sweets.\nHelp us with reaching our stretch goal of $7000 by sharing the project!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOf course, every Kickstarter project comes with a risk, but it has been almost a year since the brand was established and I am very proud of how much we have accomplished so far.\nWe have a very stable production line with kitchen space and all equipment that is carefully sanitized.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 20 or more", "title": "5 pcs (US Only First 100 boxes)", "descp": "Includes Jade (Matcha), Ametrine (lavender mango), Amber (Yuzu Yuzu peel), Phantom, Red Beryl (Hibiscus Cranberry)", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Only United States"}], "stat": ["96 backers", "Limited (4 left of 100)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 28 or more", "title": "5pcs (US & Japan)", "descp": "Includes Jade (Matcha), Ametrine (lavender mango), Amber (Yuzu Yuzu peel), Phantom, Red Beryl (Hibiscus Cranberry)", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Only certain countries"}], "stat": ["4 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 40 or more", "title": "5pcs X 2", "descp": "Flavors\n- Jade (Matcha)\n- Ametrine (lavender mango),\n- Amber (Yuzu Yuzu peel)\n- Phantom (Rose water & dried rose)\n- Red Beryl (Hibiscus Cranberry)\nBoxes can be shipped to different locations\nINCLUDES:\n2\u00d7 5pcs Crystal Treats", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Only United States"}], "stat": ["9 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 45 or more", "title": "8pcs (US & Japan)", "descp": "Includes Jade (Matcha), Ametrine (lavender mango), Amber (Yuzu Yuzu peel), Phantom, Red Beryl (Hibiscus Cranberry), Amethyst (Blueberry and pussy willow), Spessartine Garnet (Acerola and strawberry) Ruby (Passion fruit Dragon fruit)", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Only certain countries"}], "stat": ["26 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 50 or more", "title": "Snowflake Jelly & Crystal Treats Set", "descp": "Flavors for Snowflake Jelly\n- Strawberry, Raspberry, Pomegranate\n- Rose, Cardamom, Edible Flower\n- Kiwi, Flower Bud Water\n- Orange, Almond Milk\nFlavors for Crystal Treats\n- Jade (Matcha)\n- Ametrine (lavender mango),\n- Amber (Yuzu Yuzu peel)\n- Phantom (Rose water & dried rose)\n- Red Beryl (Hibiscus Cranberry)\nINCLUDES:\n4\u00d7 Snowflake Jelly\n5pcs Crystal Treats", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Only United States"}], "stat": ["10 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 70 or more", "title": "Snowflake Jelly \uff06Crystal Treats (8pc Set", "descp": "Flavors for Snowflake Jelly\n- Strawberry, Raspberry, Pomegranate\n- Rose, Cardamom, Edible Flower\n- Kiwi, Flower Bud Water\n- Orange, Almond Milk\nFlavors for Crystal Treats\n- Jade (Matcha)\n- Ametrine (lavender mango),\n- Amber (Yuzu Yuzu peel)\n- Phantom (Rose water & dried rose)\n- Red Beryl (Hibiscus Cranberry)\n- Amethyst (Blueberry and pussy willow),\n- Spessartine Garnet (Acerola and strawberry)\n- Ruby (Passion fruit Dragon fruit)\nINCLUDES:\n4\u00d7 Snowflake Jelly\n8pcs Crystal Treats", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Only United States"}], "stat": ["30 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 140 or more", "title": "5pcs X 5 boxes", "descp": "Flavors\n- Jade (Matcha)\n- Ametrine (lavender mango),\n- Amber (Yuzu Yuzu peel)\n- Phantom (Rose water & dried rose)\n- Red Beryl (Hibiscus Cranberry)\nBoxes can be shipped to different locations\nINCLUDES:\n5\u00d7 5pcs Crystal Treats", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Only United States"}], "stat": ["2 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 200 or more", "title": "Baking kit set", "descp": "New reward unlocked!\nINCLUDES:\n5pcs Crystal Treats\n1 on 1 talk with the founder Alissa (1h)\nCrystal Treats baking kit", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Only United States"}], "stat": ["0 backers", "Limited (3 left of 3)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 1,000 or more", "title": "Special Set", "descp": "You will receive a full-recipe for Crystal Treats that Alissa produced.

Northern Animal tarot started when I was l learning the tarot and was having a hard time connecting with tarot decks. I would get caught up in humans image. I found it hard to dive deep into the stories to find the messages.  I started dreaming about finding an animal tarot deck that I could still learn with and study books from! So then came the idea of making this Northern Animal Tarot deck! Ive been working designing and creating animal art for well over 15yrs. So off I went to the drawing board to make this come to life! Enjoy! Thank you!\n Enter a world full of magic where shunks ride mooses on sunny days, crows carry swords and raccoons become magicans beacuse of those thumbs!  While you use and read these fairytale animal tarot cards you can start to weave your own journey though the tarot with your new animal friends to help you. Childhood memories of building playful stories enter back into the tarot cards making them easier to read, less serious and you can dive just a deep into your questions.\nDifferent stages of the creative process of making cards!\n About the deck and its Anthropomorphic animals, I wanted a deck I could connect deeply with and yet still very playfully. So I could learn, heal and tell stories would feel like fables and stories. Easy fun and magical clear in ways only animal art can make stories. These cards can make tarot spreads in to sweet fables or long sagas with many mountains and valleys! Adventure awaits with these animal tarot cards.\n Animals as characters can bring stillness and incongruity, making stories more enjoyable. But animals also add a degree of emotional distance for the reader, which is important when the story message is personal, painful or powerful.\nFire, Earth, Water and Air cards.\n I am finishing up the colouring of this deck, Ive sketched out all 78 cards. Im very happy with the colour samples I got from the local printer. Im also packing each card full of details, so the reader has lots of exciting things to unpack in each card! With the card still being finished up, the images shown in this campaign may change slightly before the finals are sent to the printer! \nTarot Card Size: 3 x 5, full colour, gloss uv coated, 14 pt. \nThe design for the back of the tarot cards.\n Back of the tarot deck cards! A littel extra magic for this dreamy forest deck!\n\nHow to make this deck a reality! Pick one or two!\nIm printing the cards with a local company so that means no over seas stuff and more eco friendly! Locally printed and shipped to me, then I'll pack everything up all pretty and mail them out to you! The cards and box paper have 30% recycled content!\n\nAlso UNLOCKED!!! YAY! \n These goodies now included in everydeck!\n\n\nShipping things: All Canadian and American mail will have their packages shipped with tracking numbers. To all my international friends the deck will be ship by Air mail as to have it arrive as quickly as possible, but no tracking available sorry. And for customs I\u2019m sorry but I have no control over such things.\n Please make sure your payment is up to date, along with your right address! I dont want anyone to miss out on this limited edition run of decks!\nAll the pentacles and where they will be spent.\nSo my timeline is to mail out the decks in Feburay 2021!\nOn the rewards is the old date if i have launched earlier sorry! I missed changing those dates! So ignore Oct 2020 its going to be February 2021!\n Earlier would be great but I know making a good thing sometimes take more time. So after the new year in February is my mail out time line. But will keep you up to date on all the cards as they are each finalized. If in the event of any unexpected delays, Ill be completely transparent on the kickstarter page.

Each card will be lushly printed on 350gsm paper on traditionally-sized tarot cards (70x120mm), appropriately labeled with the title on each card ease of use.   \nThe Lubanko Tarot deck\nEach deck will also include a 110+ page guidebook written by me that will delineate card meanings, both upright and reversed (for those who prefer to read with reversals), as well as an introduction to help usher new folks into the concept of reading tarot. \nThe 6 of Swords. Mockup image - not final, but close!\n The deck will be held in a sturdy and richly-decorated hinge box that closes magnetically and securely, allowing for both display and transportation. I chose a sturdier box that still has a profile that is easy to transport\u2014 for those of us who are often in-between places, it is good to be able to carry our tools with us safely.     \nBox design- cover (digital mockup)\nBox design - interior (digital mockup)\n The Lubanko Tarot deck contains the standard 78 cards and is fully illustrated.  That means that all the Major Arcana and the Minor Arcana are full paintings\u2014 no pip cards.  \nThe Major Arcana art\n Every suit is a full journey, lushly-illustrated and packed full of metaphor, story, and the full range of the elements. The cards show beings of different walks of life, some closer to human and some far beyond, dipping into the diversity of life on earth and the divine of when we transcend our expected forms.  \nThe suits of Wands and Cups\nThese paintings have been lovingly and painstakingly perfected as both pieces of art and pieces to be used for reading. They were made to be read at both small and large sizes, with bright colors, strong values, and compositional movement\u2014as well as minding good contrast for those who may be colorblind and wish to read as well. I have maintained a stylistic consistency that will ensure that every reading can flow together, no matter the combination.      \nSuits of Swords and Pentacles\nYou can view some of the paintings at higher-res on my site, as well! \n   Updated: 12 pm EST, 8/24  \n\nStretch Goals - COMPLETE!\n $15,000 - SILVER EDGES -Silver holographic edges will be added to all decks. \n $25,000 - BIGGER CARDS - Cards will be made slightly bigger for even more visibility of the art, and the box/book to match!\n $30,000 - ALTAR CLOTHS - A 22\"x22\" altar cloth designed by the artist will be included with every deck order!\n $75,000 - TAROT CLASS - I will teach and stream a FREE Tarot 101 class to help people learn to read the tarot, and answer submitted backer questions!   \n  $100,000 -CLASS II - \"How To Make Your Own Tarot Deck\"  \n Stretch goals will be dedicated to making this the best deck it can be. \nThe first stretch goal will be holographic silver edges, for that extra-special touch and shine. The second stretch goal will be to make the cards slightly bigger\u2014since each painting started at 6x8\u201d (and some as large as 13x19\u201d, like the 7 of cups). They'll still be shuffling size, don't worry! \nI have a surprise or two as well if we make it past the first two! \nAny other stretch goals will be improvements to the deck and quality. My highest priority is making sure that this deck is an art object that is precious and usable. \nUPDATE: Altar cloth design COMPLETE.\nAltar Cloth design\nA reminder that altar cloths are only free with the deck at Deck level and above if you pledge on Kickstarter! All altar cloths sold afterwards will be sold for a separate price.\nBudget   \n The 10k budget includes printing (with estimates from the printer), shipping from the printer, distribution and fees, and Kickstarter fees. It is very important to me to make sure that this gets made, so I have kept things as simple and straightforward as possible! \nUsing The Cards\nMockup image. Everyone's altar is a little different!\nSo who can use this deck, and how? \nFor those who are familiar with Tarot, there are many ways to use a deck. Some use them for reflection, some for divination. Some people just enjoy having a special art object and collection of 78 prints to lay out and admire. Some folks also use tarot decks as altar pieces, or isolate specific cards. \nI personally use tarot from anything to meditation to therapy tool, and thus I have structured this deck for a wide range of uses.  \n A good tarot deck has lots of metaphor to chew on, so that each card can be a moment of self-contained meditation. With this in mind, each card was heavily considered for readability, true-ness to the intention I had for the card, and how I wished to diverge or converge with common meanings. Though many of these cards will have a familiarity to those who are experienced readers, some diverge for the sake of the clarity and honesty of message. \nEach deck will have its own 110+ page guidebook written by me with explanations of each card-- the intent, the meaning, and the reversed meanings as well. Whether you read with reversals (when the card appears upside-down in a reading) is entirely your choice, but the option is there should you like to! In addition to card definitions, there will be a short introduction from the artist, as well as a brief explanation of how to use your deck. Whether you are a beginner or advanced, this should be a welcoming tool for you.  \nThe Devil card.\n And as an art object: This is the largest collection of prints I have ever sold (some of which have never been and will never be for sale elsewhere), all contained in a handy artistic little box! \nThe Artist  \n I have been reading tarot for 18 years. Like many people, I started with a copy of the Rider Waite and many borrowed books from the library, journaling and noting. I learned to read tarot by asking myself \u201cHow does this art make me feel? What biases do I have, looking at this image? What is the story I experience when I look at this? What does the author intend, and how does that differ from my own story?\u201d \nI believe that tarot is about asking those questions, understanding how our foremost thoughts and feelings inform our decisions\u2014 and as an artist, creating a lush artistic experience that allows for people to confront those feelings, perhaps receive new intentions, and most importantly grow their own interpretations that work for them. Though each deck will include a guidebook to help interpret, these cards are meant to help the reader grapple with their personal metaphor and mythos.      \n  As a queer artist with a lens of the vivid-surreal, the sensual, and the pain-and-catharsis of life, I will be sharing that intensity, that queerness, those shocks of color with you. Where you take that is in your hands, and it is given gladly. \nThe 8 of Swords (and my funky altar)\nShipping and Fulfillment\nI am delighted to be partnering with White Squirrel, who have shipped many notable and successful Kickstarter projects before. I am excited to work with an experienced partner in shipping and fulfillment!\nSince I will be shipping this to as many countries around the world as I am able, shipping will be charged separately depending on your country and rewards level. Please make sure that you fill out the Kickstarter survey when it is time! This will make it easy for me to get the decks and rewards to you as quickly as possible.  \nNote:  All retailers interested in wholesale purchases, please reach out to me at emilylubanko@gmail.com. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI finished the deck before Kickstarting, so there\u2019s no risk of the art not being finished. The guidebook is 95% done\u2014 I have a second round of edits to do, but the bulk of the writing is done and I\u2019m just waiting on a quick editing pass. \n\nAll the art for the rewards, both current and Secret Stretch Goals, are done. The box art is done. \n\nI waited a while to launch this Kickstarter because I wanted to make sure that it was doable and done. I have already been in long contact with and have a good relationship with both my printer and the good folks at White Squirrel, so both the printing and fulfillment talks are in motion. \n\nCOVID-19 is the biggest risk for the printing, shipping and delivery section of this process, and therefore I have put a much later delivery date than I actually anticipate. Though I will likely be ready to start printing as soon as the Kickstarter ends, there is a likely chance of delays due to the nature of the beast there\u2014 in printing, but most especially in shipping. In a perfect world everyone would have their deck by the end of the year. However, I am printing my deck overseas and having it shipped to the US, and then back out to backers around the world. These delays and issues may especially impact international shipments. I have therefore opted for a conservative delivery date.

Stay Silent.\n90 years ago, a cataclysmic pandemic turned the Old World into a place of silence and fear. Most of the surviving population of the Known World live in Iceland, now the largest safe area in existence, with a few smaller settlements scattered in Norway, Sweden, Denmark and Finland.\nHunters, mages and cleansers dedicate their lives to defending these settlements from the terrifying beings from beyond the safe areas, creatures from the Silent World. Before now, there has been no official attempts to explore the Silent World.\nAn underfunded, questionably selected, rag-tag team of explorers are assembled and launched into the unknown in a search for information and relics of the Old World - hopefully valuable relics. Stand Still. Stay Silent. follows six people (and a cat) on a journey filled with adventure, camaraderie and Nordic mythology. Who knows what they might find on their journey... and what they might lose.\nStand Still. Stay Silent, also called SSSS, began in November 2013, and can be read online on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday on sssscomic.com. In 2015, SSSS won the Reuben Award for \"best online comic-long form\"\nSSSS is published online with the support of Hiveworks who also manages the store for the comic! \nStand Still. Stay Silent. Book 3 will include:\nA hardcover finish (with a textured cover).\nChapters 11 to 16 of the ongoing webcomic.\n 300+ pages in full color in a 7x10 format.\n Bonus content (a little kitty adventure and illustrations!)\nNo cat hairs (not a guarantee).\nThe first book was first printed thanks to an Indiegogo campaign ran by the author, Minna Sundberg. It was then reprinted as a second edition, along with the first edition of book 2, following a successful Kickstarter campaign in 2018 ran by Hiveworks. A small print run of book 3 has already been produced directly by Minna to be sold to buyers in Finland and select EU countries through her personal pop-up online store. This Kickstarter is for the larger run of book 3, printed and shipped by Hiveworks anywhere in the world.\nBackers have the possibility to not only grab the print volume, but also to select desired rewards. Here is a list of the available rewards.\nThe main two physical rewards beyond the books are the set of stickers and the bookplates. The stickers are a set of 3 die-cut stickers, two with a holographic finish and one with a color finish. \nThe Bookplate reward exists in two formats - Signed and Sketched. The Signed bookplate is a stylish adhesive plate autographed by Minna. Bookplates will be received with a backing covering the sticky side. Backers can then remove the backing and stick the bookplate wherever they please in their book. The Sketched one is also adhesive and sent with backing, and includes a cat doodle alongside Minna's signature.\nFor backers selecting the tiers that include all three books, please note that book 1 is exceptionally sold at the same price as books 2 & 3 ($35 USD) in the bundle!\nDue to current circumstances, this Kickstarter campaign has been kept very simple, with a limited set of rewards, and no stretch goals, allowing Minna to focus on her work, and allowing our team to get the books to backers swiftly. \nFor backers who are only missing the second book, or are interested in other SSSS goodies, we encourage you to check out the SSSS Hiveworks store. Among other items, we still have many kitty plushies looking for someone to take them on a journey!\nThank you for your support!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis Kickstarter is backed by Hiveworks Comics, a creator-owned publishing house and studio that supports hundreds of webcomics.

I'm Mongie, the creator of the Eisner-nominated webtoon, \"Let's Play!\" And I'm back with a new Kickstarter for the second book in the Let's Play Print Series!\n\n If you are new to my work and like gaming, comedy, and romance stories, I've got over 125 episodes of my comic to sink your teeth in.  Head on over to WEBTOON.com (letsplaycomic.com) and join over 3.6 million Let's Play readers!\n\n Thanks to our awesome supporters, the campaign for volume one was a huge success!  And despite all the chaos of 2019 and 2020, we delivered all the goodies to our lovely backers.  And in this project, we are hoping to raise funds for volume two print edition!  We have several new addons and stretch goals planned!  And thanks to reaching the stretch goal in the last campaign, volume two has already been formatted for print, so we will be able to put it into production as soon as possible!\n\n I wanted to thank you all again for your incredible support in my comic, Let's Play! It's been an exciting adventure, and I have loved seeing readers share photos of their Kickstarter goodies.  If you'd like to share your pictures with me, please do so by tagging me (@mongrelmarie) on Twitter or Instagram!\nABOUT LET'S PLAY: She's young, single and about to achieve her dream of creating incredible videogames. But then life throws her a one-two punch: a popular streamer gives her first game a scathing review. Even worse, she finds out that the same troublesome critic is now her new neighbor! A funny, sexy, and all-too-real story about gaming, memes, and social anxiety. Come for the plot, stay for the doggo.\nLet's Play is an ongoing webcomic on LINE Webtoon with over 3.6 million subscribers. This is your chance to be the first to get your hands on the reformatted print edition of volume 2, which collects chapters 24 through 40 of Let's Play - approximately 200 pages of content!\nThe goal of the Kickstarter is to get the comic into your hands as quickly as possible! The more we raise, the more content goes in the book, the more stretch goals are unlocked, and the more add ons we can offer. We'll reveal the stretch goal that's available to hit next, and when it unlocks, we'll reveal the next one. Ditto with the add ons, and we think everyone will be pleasantly surprised with each!\nThe other stretch goal we can tell you about now is to unlock volume 3; we're looking to hit 60k. That allows us to do all of the pre-production on reformatting and vendor work before the volume 3 Kickstarter. Meaning when that volume is Kickstarted, it will have already been sent to the printers, and we'll have approved proofs back.\nSo, what am I getting for my pledge? First, all backers at the $24 Let's Play Volume 2 Graphic Novel level will get the collected edition, printed at 5.7\"x8.2\" with a matte finish wrap around cover. Each page of the comic will be carefully reformatted to provide the same quality of reading experience many of you have already had online. Since we hit the Stretch Goal for volume 2 in the last Kickstarter, the entire book has already been prepped for print!\nLet's Play Volume 2 Page Proofs:\n Scroll down for more pages! \nPlease note that shipping costs are not included in your pledge.

I like to believe that we live again and again, it makes it all seem more worth something. Different lives give us a full understanding and perspective on what it means to really be alive. \nI created this oracle to tell one story of what may happen in the space between lives, re-imagined upon the structure of classic 78 card tarot deck. I spent years thinking about creating a companion deck to Prisma Visions and now after nearly 2 years of researching, drawing, rendering, redrawing and writing it is finally here! \nNothing about making Cosma Visions was easy, but it was a beautiful experience. It made me feel more whole, more connected and more inspired. All I can hope now is that it does the same for you and moves you along an elegant path filled of wonder and appreciation for the greatness of life. Thank you for your patience, I know for some of you it feels as if you have been waiting years for this deck, and I've teased you enough with it. So here it is, for you to hold and get to know and love, The Cosma Visions Oracle.  \nBefore you continue reading you should know that thanks to nearly 5,000 backers we have unlocked many many stretch goal items. Here's a look at what comes free with most pledges: \nDeath. It is what we often fear most and know so little about. We imagine it as the soundless dark void where there is nothing, everywhere. But in this oracle, death marks the start. Perhaps, it is here that we can finally see death not as the impending force of doom we so fear, but rather an escort to our next chapter. It is the end of a cycle and opens a door for a new lifetime to unfold.\nThe oracle then begins with the five alchemical birds, thought to be representative of the few moments after death and the journey of the soul reconnecting to itself. \nAfter the five birds, we are taken to the Spirit Plane and are reminded of things once forgotten: the importance of Soulmates, The Spirit Plane, The Orbs, The Cosmic Tree, Life Maps, Karma and Sacrifice. We are taught about Past Lives and when we are ready we are taken back to the Maze to journey to a new life. \nIn the Maze we find many Vessels, but only some are the right fit. Opening the Vessel takes you to the Shore until you cross the Veil and find the Bridge to Infinite Paths and the Unknown.\nIt is on the other side of the Unknown that you fall back into Life on Earth, and the beauty of another cycle unfolds...\nAfter the journey of the soul through the Major Arcana, we are met with the Minor Arcana - 56 cards that all come together to tackle living a human Life on Earth. \nLike the Prisma Visions deck, in each Cosma Visions deck are elaborate panorama images that you can assemble by lining up the suits:\nIn the first suit, The Spark of Embers, the soul embarks on its first journey on earth after spending time in the spirit plane. It takes you on a quest that challenges and inspires the soul. During this suit we encounter the devastation of fire but also the ability to turn this powerful element into a force of creation.\nIn the Dance of Lotuses, the soul is reconnected to the heart. Dominated by emotions, the heart searches for balance and freedom to love. During this suit we learn about pain and love and the interconnectedness of the two. We celebrate unions and connections and personal empowerment through understanding deep emotions.\nIn the Flight of Birds, the soul and the heart are reintroduced to the mind. It is here at the base of Wise Mountain that the soul must journey through the cavities of the mind to reach a point of clarity and understanding. In this suit we witness frustration, internal struggles and mental anguish, but we also learn about rest, reflection and mental precision.\nIn the Growth of Trees, the soul, heart and mind are fused together with the body. It is during this suit that we experience labor, wealth, leisure and decay. Through hard work and dedication we learn to grow from our challenges and foster our strengths.\n\n...But wait there's something else...\nCosma Visions panoramas connect back to where they started. For example, the tenth card loops back to the first card, creating an endless panorama. This means you can start the image at any point! I'm really excited by this new feature and I think it will allow the reader to break out of the box with creative readings. \n The Cosma Visions oracle can be used like any normal tarot or oracle deck. My hope is that it will be quick to learn because of the various similarities this oracle has to tarot. \nThe one major difference between this deck and a tarot deck, besides the names of each card, is the fifth suit - the suit of Beings. This suit is comprised of all of the court cards normally found across the standard four suits and instead creates the fifth suit. These are the court cards, transformed. \nThe Sixteen Beings\nI want this deck to be used just as if it were a tarot deck. I want weight to be held in the gravity of the Major Arcana and I want themes to unfold throughout the minors.

THE COSMA VISIONS ORACLE: $40 \nThe Cosma Visions Oracle is designed similarly to Prisma Visions, which will allow you to use both decks together. If you are familiar with my previous decks, you are likely aware that these cards are of the highest quality. \nThe cards are printed on high quality 300 gsm acid free paper and the finishing on the first edition cards of Cosma Visions is a hybrid between both Prisma Visions and Light Visions, they are smooth and matte but hold rich color and feel great in your hands. The edges are finished with a labradorite holographic blue.\nPLAY\n\nThe box is an upgraded version of the Prisma Visions box. It's a fliptop clamshell box with 1/8\" thick cardboard construction. There are holographic accents on both the inside and outside of the box and it is all printed on soft matte paper - it feels like butter in your hands!\nPLAY\n\n\nThe booklet is included with all decks and is around 100 pages. It includes an introduction to the deck, a few example spreads and upright card meanings for all 78 cards. The booklet fits snuggly into the box just like previous editions of Prisma Visions.  \nPLAY\n\nIf you want an in-depth look at all of the cards and the big book, Kelly has done a wonderful extensive review on the Cosma Visions deck, warning: spoiler alerts!\n 2. THE HARDCOVER EXPANSION BOOK: $25\nThis book has nearly 400 pages of content and is an expanded look at both Cosma Visions AND Prisma Visions.There are 200 pages dedicated to Cosma Visions and 200 pages dedicated to Prisma Visions. I designed this as a dual cover book, on one side is Cosma Visions and when you flip it over you can read the Prisma Visions Book. \nPLAY\n\nEach card has its own spread, on the left is a full color illustration of the card and on the right is the card meaning. The big book includes upright and reversed meanings as well as keywords to help you learn the cards.  \nThe beginning section of the book dives into the process of creating the deck as well as a few unique spreads that can be used with Cosma Visions and Prisma Visions together.  \nBeside each card's meaning is a full color illustration of each card, making it not only easier to flip through but also an art book. The book itself is 8.5 x 6 inches (21.5cm x 15.2cm),bound in fabric and embossed with metallics. If you're backing this project, It's not to be missed! The book is 8.5 x 6 inches \n 3. THE SATCHEL: $10\nThe Cosma Visions Satchel is similar to the Prisma Visions and Light Visions Satchels, and comes in a beautiful teal color. This time the design on the satchel is embossed! This is a custom designed satchel and fits the full deck as well as the mini guidebook. The satchel is designed as a fold-over closure with an extended flap to do quick 3 card readings on the go.\n4. THE ALTAR CLOTH: $10\nA 22x22 teal faux suede altar cloth with a metallic printed image on both sides of the cloth - one side for Cosma Visions, one side for Prisma Visions - it's two cloths in one! It's not wearable, but it's sturdy and won't hold a crease!   If you would like to add an altar cloth to your existing pledge you can do so now by adding $10 to your pledge. Post-campaign altar cloths will retail at $25.\n 5. COSMA VISIONS ART CARD SET: $10 \nA set of 22 4x6 cards of the major arcana of Cosma Visions. Each card will be double sided and have the meditation written on the back of the card with gold foil. \nPLAY\n\n   6. THE REGRESSIONS JOURNAL: 1 for $10, 2 for $20 \n There is a blank version and a regressions workbook version. They will both be 6x9 inches (the same size as the Big Visions Book) with a faux leather cover and a string closure with a custom metal charm. \nWorkbook: six-ring bound , 80 brown kraft pages with designed sheets. Available in Teal or Light Grey. \nBlank Journal: six-ring bound, 80 cream pages with blank sheets. Available in Teal or Light Grey. \nThe Regressions Journal is a $10 add-on item. If you want two/both versions it is a $20 add-on. Please see update #18 for more info on the Journals. \n\n 7. GEOMANTIC VISIONS: $35 \nA set of sixteen 3D metal coins that represent the 16 different geomantic figures based on the suit of beings.

Hopefully a lot of this will be resolved by the time rewards are sent out, but it is not uncommon for packages to take up to 8 weeks to arrive internationally (yes, I know, that's a lot of time). \nPlease keep in mind that your country may impose import taxes upon the items arrival in your country. Our pricing does not include local taxes, duties and VAT. That will be subject to the laws and regulations of each individual country, but we will do our best to minimize the costs on our end. \nI appreciate each one of you helping bring this project to life, truly, really. Over the past six years I have created five kickstarter campaigns and each one has brought a certain life into the projects that I could have never imagined. \nAlso please keep in mind, all of these images are of the first prototypes, there are bound to be changes to the design as the project evolves. \nPlease share among your friends with the link below, the more people we have the more stretch goals we will hit:\nhttps://www.kickstarter.com/projects/jamesreads/the-cosma-visions-oracle-deck-and-prisma-visions-tarot-book\nThank you, thank you, thank you.\nI hope you are excited as I am for the future of Cosma Visions.\nBe well,\nJames", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nProduction schedules have really been delayed due to Covid, but I have planned ahead for this and I have a great team that will be ready when it comes time to shipping off rewards.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "The Past is a Present", "descp": "A pack of 6 cards from the Prisma Visions editions.

But instead of slipping easily into a relationship - like Janek\u2019s used to - Chepi\u2019s emotional fragility keeps them apart.\nAfter everything they\u2019ve been through surviving the magical perils of the forest, Chepi can\u2019t bear to part yet, and agrees to come stay with Janek at the end of their long journey.   \nVolume 3\nNow, in volume 3, Janek has finally made it home from his travels to his family and friends - but now he\u2019s back, so are all his old problems he left to avoid. Worse still, his stressful new promotion in the family business suddenly keeps him away from Chepi.   \n Arriving in town, Chepi is swept up in a whirlwind of unfamiliar activity, new places and people. Desperately trying to keep control over his anxiety problems, and to avoid prying questions about a strange magic ritual he used on Janek, Chepi seems to be careening towards disaster.\nThe two of them are out of the woods. But can their new surroundings bring them together - or will it tear them apart?  \nRewards\nFor this kickstarter, rewards have been designed to help everything run smoothly in the current situation, and keep everyone\u2019s safety and delivering the book itself the highest priority.\nTimes are tough at the moment - so this project includes an increased number of reduced-price earlybird slots for the book itself, as well as more digital tiers and special bundle prices for those wanting to avoid international shipping costs and wait times.\nEach physical copy also comes with a PDF of Volume 3 free, so all backers can read the story sooner if they prefer - an estimated 9+ months ahead of the public webcomic.\n\nFor this kickstarter's physical rewards, bulkier merch items have been switched out to minimise manufacturing and shipping delays - instead focusing on working with some amazing artists to put together a really special art bundle that\u2019s small but beautiful. \n\n The Prince special bundle includes the book itself, along with a fold-out illustrated map and two A5 art prints by some of my favourite artists, with exclusive art made just for the kickstarter. The prints will be on card made from sustainably certified, 100% recycled fibres, and digitally printed with a silk finish.\nStretch goal extras\nAny extra money raised all goes in to being able to make the next part of Finding Home. There\u2019ll also be 2 stretch goals which are upgrades to the existing book and rewards if the project hits \u00a37.5k and \u00a310k...\n\u00a37.5k Stretch goal - UNLOCKED\nThanks to hitting the first stretch goal at \u00a37.5k, The Prince bundle will also be getting an extra print added - a second portrait by Marlowe Lune commissioned as a companion piece to Chepi's.\n\u00a310k Stretch goal - UNLOCKED\nExtra sketches and a flower guide added to the back of Volume 3 for easier reference!\n Guest Artists \n Charlot is a Black artist, designer and author based in Dublin who often depicts minorities and underrepresented characters in challenging socio-political context. She\u2019s illustrated for big name clients including Penguin Random House, the New Yorker and the New York Times, and her new graphic novel What We Don\u2019t Talk About is out this August with Avery Hill Press. \n Website | Twitter | Instagram | Book\nI\u2019m a huge fan of Charlot\u2019s beautiful, vibrant, evocative work and the tender, expressive moments she creates between characters. I\u2019m incredibly excited to be able to work with her on a special piece for this campaign!\n Marlowe Lune is a fantasy artist based in Cincinnati, Ohio. They specialise in beautifully lush and detailed illustrations exploring fairytales, book arts and queer stories.\nWebsite | Twitter | Instagram | Book\nI\u2019m in awe of Marlowe's illustration as well as their tarot and book inspired framing - they're working on a character portrait for their print that explores some of the symbolism in the series, and I'm extremely excited to see what they come up with.\n About the author \n Hello, I'm Hari - I'm both the writer and artist for Finding Home. I'm a queer, disabled comic creator based in the UK, and have been making Finding Home since 2016. Collecting and printing the story as graphic novels means a huge amount to me, and the comic really wouldn't be possible without reader support. \nAs well as comics I'm also an illustrator for fantasy books & games - you might know me as the author of the choose-your-own-path book Into the Dungeon, the artist for the official Adventure Zone game, or possibly the person who made their entire animal crossing island forest. \n You can find me on twitter & instagram, and my website here.\nMore info & FAQs\nHow many books will there be?\nThere are going to be 4 volumes in total - this is the penultimate book. (See FAQ tab for more info!)\nWhere can I buy all 3 books?\nWhile the kickstarter is running, you can buy the first two physical books in a specially priced bundle here on Etsy, and get the third separately through this kickstarter.\nFor this project, there isn't a reward tier with all 3 physical books (FAQ tab has more info on why this was the best choice for the book!) But if you're a new reader, you can get all 3 books as PDFs in the specially discounted catchup bundle tier - and they also come free with 'The Prince' bundle. \nWhat age is this comic suitable for?\nI describe Finding home as older teen+ or 16+, as a general guide - it broadly matches guidelines for a film rated 15 by the British Board of Film Classification.\nThe comic does not include explicit images, but the story does include strong language, themes about sexual relationships and touches on trauma and mental health issues. The Finding Home books (and PDF versions) have warnings on the contents page with relevant page numbers. Please message me on kickstarter if you have any questions or specific concerns.\nFinance breakdown\nThe majority of the money will go towards printing costs for the book, followed by the cost of postage and packaging (including shipping overseas), then rewards (including guest art) and Kickstarter fees.\nWho\u2019s the writer/ colourist/ editor/ printer?\nI do the art, writing and lettering for Finding Home.\n- The comic is edited by Claire Napier\n- And the books are printed by Comic Printing UK\nPlanning for COVID-19\nThis is a more streamlined kickstarter with a shorter runtime than some of my previous projects, focused on delivering the book itself in the most effective way possible in the current global situation.\nEverything\u2019s being planned for the project to be run with minimal disruption, with everyone\u2019s safety and delivering the book the highest priority.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI've fulfilled all my previous kickstarters with time to spare, and will be using trusted printers, manufacturers and postal systems I\u2019ve used many times before. I am expecting changes due to COVID-19 and have been making plans accordingly to minimise risks and delays.\n\n- Safety\n\nThe project is being run in a way to minimise risk and keep safety a priority for everyone involved. I\u2019m disabled and me, my family and usual assistant happen to all be vulnerable to the virus. Smaller reward parcels will minimise in-person contact at post facilities for everyone, and special precautions will be taken to keep everything absolutely clean and hygienic in the way parcels are packed and everything is handled.\n\n- International shipping\n\nMany countries' postal services are overwhelmed at the moment, notably USPS and Canada Post, which can take 4-6 weeks or longer to deliver international parcels at the time of writing, depending on your location. Please check online for details of your country\u2019s postal system and any delays they\u2019re currently experiencing! (If your country's postal system is not currently operational, it may not be possible to get a physical book to you - we'll do everything we can, but we may have to organise delayed posting or a refund. Please get in contact if you have concerns!)\n\nAs a result of disruption from COVID-19, estimated delivery has been pushed back to allow for delays with the post, as well as giving extra time to deal with any unforseen issues and fulfil rewards safely.\n\nBackers will be kept updated on progress of any disruptions if they arise.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a38 or more", "title": "PDF Book only", "descp": "INCLUDES:\nVolume 3 PDF", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2020"}], "stat": ["23 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a312 or more", "title": "PDF Book Bundle", "descp": "Volume 3 PDF, and a new 50+ page behind-the-scenes artbook.\nINCLUDES:\nVolume 3 PDF\n50+ page artbook PDF", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2020"}], "stat": ["15 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a315 or more", "title": "Physical copy - just the book", "descp": "INCLUDES:\nVolume 3 physical book\nVolume 3 PDF", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["89 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a318 or more", "title": "PDF Catchup bundle", "descp": "PDF bundle with all 3 volumes for new readers.\nIncludes a 50+ page behind-the-scenes artbook, and a short prequel not available in the webcomic\nINCLUDES:\nVolume 1 PDF\nVolume 2 PDF\nVolume 3 PDF\n\u2018Hunters\u2019 - prequel minicomic PDF\n50+ page artbook PDF", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2020"}], "stat": ["68 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a325 or more", "title": "The Prince special bundle", "descp": "A physical copy of Volume 3 plus exclusive guest art, map, and 50+ page PDF artbook.\nIncludes a free PDF bundle with all 3 volumes & prequel for new readers.\nINCLUDES:\nVolume 3 physical book\nFold-out map\nExclusive guest art prints\n50+ page artbook PDF\nPDF catchup bundle added free - 'Hunters' & Volumes 1-3 PDFs", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["191 backers", "Limited (9 left of 200)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a312 or more", "title": "EARLYBIRD Physical copy - just the book", "descp": "INCLUDES:\nVolume 3 physical book\nVolume 3 PDF", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["Reward no longer available", "100 backers"]}], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #6", "update_userinfo": "Posted! \u2728", "update_content": "As of next week, we will have posted out all the rewards for Volume 3!"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #5", "update_userinfo": "Books arrived!", "update_content": "The books have all arrived!!

I'm a digital artist living in the Netherlands. Thank you so much for checking out the Kickstarter for my first ArtZine!\nDuring the Mermay Challenges in previous years I created several mermaid illustrations. For these I received such positive feedback from my audience, that it inspired me to start this project! You may have seen my work before on Instagram or Facebook.\nThe title of the Zine is \"Siren Song\" and is a collection of 20 Mermaid illustrations I made over the last three months. I hope to share these illustrations with everyone in a physical format.\nSiren Song: mermaid artzine spread mockup (the final design may change)\nMermaids have always been my favourite fantasy creatures to draw. Did you know that over eighty percent of the ocean is still unexplored? This interesting fact makes my imagination go wild. I keep creating stories about the mysterious Merfolk with all their undiscovered secrets.\nFor example, I like to fantasize how mermaids don't age the same way as any other (non magical) creature. Instead of growing old they are slowly consumed by the sea. Turning into seashells and coral, returning to the ocean, not leaving a trace...\u2800\nSiren Song will be an A5 sized (14,8 cm x 21 cm) Artzine containing 20 full page art illustrations. The zine will be printed in full color on 170 gram high quality paper. To enhance a stylish presentation the Zine will have a 300 gram paper gloss laminated cover. \nSiren Song will be a limited edition print, so all zines will be signed and numbered. Backers at the highest tier will get an original & unique doodle inside their zine.\nWith your help I hope to turn this project into a reality.\nI'm keeping this campaign simple with a limited selection of reward Tiers.\n\nI'm able to ship worldwide! Simply select your pledge option and your location, Kickstarter will calculate the shipping for you. Please also be aware of customs fees in your country as this is out of my control.\nAll rewards will be sent out at the same time, packed with care and love.\nWe've reached all of our stretch goals! Meaning an additional eight new mermaid illustrations will appear in Siren Song. Plus everyone who has backed Tier 2 and above will receive a bookmark and a set of three postcards for free. \n*final designs may be subject to change\nThe primary costs for this project are printing and shipping. There is a small buffer for unforeseen costs. I'll only be making a profit from this project after the funding goal is met.\nSylvia is a digital illustrator living in the Netherlands. She graduated from Art Academy Minerva in 2012 with a bachelor in Fine Art. The ethereal and melancholic has always fascinated her. Currently she combines this with her love for portraiture and the fantastical, all with the goal to create work that lures you into an other world. \nFor those who are not familiar with Kickstarter, it\u2019s a worldwide crowd-funding platform for artists and their creative projects. Your payment is only collected at the end of an successfully funded campaign. If we don't reach the funding goal by the campaign's end date, you won't be charged anything. \nA month before shipping I'll send you a survey through Kickstarter, asking for your shipping address.

My Papa brought me up loving nature and those around me, and that love truly blossoms with Tam'n\u00fder\u2014a'. It is a dedication to him, and the beauty of our diverse world transmogrified into a role-playing Fantasy World.\nIn the past 3 years, what was only supposed to be a ship in some far off land as a platform for role-play evolved into this massive world that now 30 some-odd people across the world partake in. Along the way, Dorian came on the scene and soon fell in love with the world and was quick to become a collaborator. With her innate sense of creativity and spiritualism Tam'n\u00fder\u2014a' has only grown, and now is so much bigger than myself. \nMap of Tam'n\u00fder\u2014a'\nWith Tam'n\u00fder\u2014a' being a world originally designed solely for role-play, it has grown far beyond that box. With its Gods, Goddesses and being a world ripe with superstitions, the calling to make an Oracle Deck using the deities has been a natural evolution of our creative & spiritual process.\nNow, you might be wondering things like:\nWhat is an Oracle Deck?\nWhat do the deities of Tam'n\u00fder\u2014a' have to do with the real world?\nWhat does it include?\nHow much will the deck cost?\nWhen can I expect it?\nThese are all really great questions, and I'll do my best to give you a quick run down to answer all of these.\n\n               First things first;\n Chances are you've heard of Tarot and probably know what a Tarot Deck is. Tarot is a spiritual belief and 'fortune telling' tool comprised of 72 cards. Out of these 72 cards there is a Major Arcana and a Minor Arcana. The Major Arcana is where we get the popular cards - the ones you've probably heard about like 'The Fool' or 'The Hermit' or that dreaded Tower card! \n\n               An Oracle Deck is very similar to Tarot in the way that it is a deck of cards that deal with the metaphysical and help you sort out life's big questions. However, the key difference is that an Oracle deck can be whatever you want it to be, and how big you want it to be. It doesn't have a Minor Arcana that consists of Cups, Wands, Sword and Pentacles, and it's cards can be listed as whatever the creator of said deck wants it to be. \n\n               There are hundreds of Oracle decks out there, just like different stylizations of traditional Tarot, so you might find yourself wondering \"How do I know which one to get?\" and the answer is actually really simple. It's whatever you feel drawn to. Think of it like trusting your gut instinct, or being 'pulled' to a particular piece of jewelry in a store. It's the same idea. If you feel a resonance with a deck, that's probably a sign that this might be the one for you and we hope that as you read on that you might feel a pull towards ours: Tam'n\u00fder\u2014a', a Fantasy Oracle. But just in case you don't, that's okay too.\nJn & Nue's cards facing each other\nNow this answer might get a bit tricky and long winded, so buckle up and get ready!\nTam'n\u00fder\u2014a' itself is a fantasy world that is incredibly spiritual and stalwart. In the official lore most of all the Gods & Goddesses are considered to be dead, and yet people still worship the gods and give offerings. Where there is doubt, superstitions have crept in to take place and help act as guiding tools for the people there. In fact, reading cards, just like this Oracle Deck we are trying to make, would be a replica of the cards we envision the denizens of Tam'n\u00fder\u2014a' using to tell their fortunes and try to get clarity with their paths, be it their life path or their spiritual one. However, in Tam'n\u00fder\u2014a', we refer to this as \"making your own tapestry.\"\nEvery single God and Goddess plays an important role in representing a factor of life, or the world around us, and it is as intricate as the real world that we live in. There is good, and there is bad, but all of it helps us in our journey. Without it, we would not be who we are right now, in this moment. The same is believed in Tam'n\u00fder\u2014a'. There is very little that is different between this fantasy world crafted as a role-play platform and ours, as Tam'n\u00fder\u2014a' is inspired by the multi-faceted world we have created around us over time; diverse cultures & extraordinary peoples. \n\n               That being said, I invite you to check out Tam'n\u00fder\u2014a''s Gods and Goddesses and see for yourself the intricacies of the belief system here, and get an understanding of what they represent and how they can, not only effect you, but help you in your journey; in making your own tapestry.\n\n               For the sake of the Kickstarter and understanding that you are probably not at all familiar with Tam'n\u00fder\u2014a', I am going to be focusing on the three gods colloquially known as Y'ljn\u00f6x; they are the gods of Love, Friendship & Possession, and to help get you acquainted I will refer to them as we go on and to give you a taste of what this deck has in store for you.\nExamples of our Cards; Gods & Goddesses Nue, VuF, Q'Tam'sma, Nyer-a', Y'l, Jn & Ox\nIn Tam'n\u00fder\u2014a', the 32 Gods and Goddesses are viewed as transcendent truth. They define the world, their stories are eternal, and they touch and resonate with us as only myths can do. Their lessons are profound and multi-layered; they are compelling for the spiritual truth-seeker and the mundane-preoccupied alike. In other words, the perfect guides on our soul journey, allowing us to meditate and discover ourselves in all our beautiful complexity, but also to co-create our paths; make our own tapestry.\n\n               As everything, especially when it comes to mythos, they can be left open to interpretation individual to individual, but ultimately there lies a fundamental lesson. The Divine Family, in which Y'ljn\u00f6x are the sons, is where it all starts to trickle down.\n\n               To give you a quick understanding, on one fine evening when the brothers regaled whilst drinking, Jn decided to prank his brothers, but this time he would take it much too far and seal their fates. He decided that out of a bit of fun, he would sneak into their parents' room and take a piece of their heart. To Jn, this was not only fun, but a way to express love to both his brothers, both older and younger than himself; Y'l and \u00d6x. \n\n               Without telling his siblings what it was, he merely offered it as something for them to try, and knowing that it was their parents' heart, which consequently must be love for them, why not get high on it? So they did! The unsuspecting brothers tore it apart into little pieces and proceeded to smoke it. Jn, took part, of course, but not as much because he was much more excited to see the effects take hold, especially considering that he was expecting to watch his brothers become elated as they would no doubt be filled with love, admiration and gratitude.\n\n               However, that was not to be the case at all. Soon after, Y'l and \u00d6x became ill. Something was terribly wrong, and while Jn hadn't smoked too much, he wasn't feeling the best either. Lucky for Jn, he could leave the room with his life. His brothers were not so blessed as that as they laid there on the floor, bereft of life. \n\n               You see, the issue was that they already possessed their parents' love and that their parent's heart was not something that they had rights to take and alter. Them extinguishing the piece of heart for their own pleasure and enjoyment that was not their own showed a fatal level of greed.\n\n               Ah, but what happened to Jn? Well, of course he had to tell his parents eventually, and with that came full circle. Out of anger and heartbreak, Sea & Sky, their parents, killed their only remaining son, and with that, Jn's body fell down to Tam'n\u00fder\u2014a', and breaking apart on impact, his body became the various land masses of the world. Soon, overtaken by grief, Q'Tam'\u0161m\u0103, the Goddess of the Sea, laid down and held the broken body of her son, and unable to leave her, N\u00fder\u2014a', the God of the Sky, laid beside her, to never leave her alone with her grief which consumed her on account of their own hasty actions.\n \n               As you can tell, there are many lessons and various meanings to our tales, and these profound sentiments are reflected in our Oracle Deck even beyond just the cards, but the 8 exclusive spreads we have designed solely for it as well.\nNo matter where you are, or what race happens to tickle your fancy, the Gods & Goddesses of Tam'n\u00fder\u2014a' are paramount. This Kickstarter is to help bring them back to life in our own way; to honour them with proper art and a well-thought out Oracle Deck.\nThe Tam'n\u00fder\u2014a' Fantasy Oracle deck can be used both for mundane readings and spiritual ones, complete with exclusive spreads for readings as well.\nMundane Readings focus is on the tangible world, relationships, what is outside of us. Having a challenge or a personal issue, healing, trauma, would also be Mundane, in the sense of ordinary life, daily life. These Spreads are simple layouts depending on the type of question: the Tapestry (featured below), the Journey, United (Lovers), and the New Life, a customary reading to have for a child. Readings for other persons than the querent are strongly discouraged, with the exception of the New Life reading.\nThe Tapestry Spread, two versions\nYou will note that the Tapestry Spread, which is inspired by V\u00fc\u0191, the God of Time, also allows for an unfocused option; this is on purpose. When life is hectic, we don't simply have just one problem, and often we don't know what to deal with first. These are the times when we could use guidance the most!\nIn Spiritual Readings the focus is inward always, but also on reaching out and communing with the Gods (if they resonate with you), or reaching out (or rather, upwards) and communing with Spirit on our journey to enlightenment. These Spreads are are another four layouts known as The Guide, Redemption, Truth Seeker, and the V\u00fc\u0191 and Vojsh\u0101 Spread which is used when the only two Gods who are still deemed alive are asked for guidance.\nThe Guide Spread\nFor you, the reader, the Tam'n\u00fder\u2014a' Fantasy Oracle deck offers a fresh and unconventional perspective, the possibility to tap into inspiration unencumbered by centuries of history. If the images and stories speak to you, if you find them as compelling as we did, then this may be the Oracle Deck you were looking for. The layouts are there to guide you, and they could all be read for mundane matters as well as spiritual, but you could also use the cards and the beautiful images themselves for meditation and contemplation.\n Our reward tiers include something for everyone:\nAll 32 cards of the Oracle Deck will feature art done by Yayu @artofyayu \u2014 which is the bulk of what this Kickstarter hopes to achieve \u2014 with the backs of each card designed by myself and my co-creator Dorian Moreau to incorporate the symbol of the belief of Numerology in Tam'n\u00fder\u2014a', which ties into the Gods themselves. In choosing Yayu for the art, and freedom of artistic interpretation, I could not be happier as she has a knack and history of depicting mythological motifs; a huge reason why we chose her. \nFor collectors, we also have a limited edition tier:\nIn addition to the art, this campaign is designed to cover the production costs to make the Oracle Deck a physical reality and tied to that are also the Stretch Goals, but we'll get to those in a moment.\nThe Oracle Deck will include:\nBlue Core Standard - 280 gsm (Finish Type; Lamination)\nTuck Box; varnish; gloss finish\nInstructions*; printed in Black & White; 24 pgs\n*The Instructions are what each card means when you do your readings as well as the 8 exclusive spreads designed for the deck itself.\nFurthermore, we will be getting our Oracle Deck printed by PrintNinja!\nBy printing our deck with PrintNinja, we're not only getting a great product, but supporting a company that supports other Kickstarters as well. It's a win-win and it's an honour to work with them.\nThey offer fantastic service and our base minimums of printing with them (as well as shipping the lot to me) for 500 decks is $3,228.41\n*Please note that these prices are in USD and that I, Nicholas S\u00e9bastien reside in Canada, so I have rounded up the CAD exchange to make certain that I will have enough to transfer into USD when concerning the Goal and the unlocked prices for our Stretch Goals\n Making our TOTAL BASE GOAL = US$ 14,367.82 (roughly 20k CAD)\nThis brings us to\u2014\n The Oracle Deck itself will be $55 CAD\n\n               Right now, according to XE.com for a conversion rate of 1 USD = 1.34 CAD, that makes the deck approximately $41 USD\n\n*Please note that these prices do not include shipping and that the exchange rate fluctuates. Thankfully Kickstarter will adjust to your personal currency.\n Because the world is a bit topsy-turvy right now, and we never really know when things could potentially get worse or better, we are setting an expectation date of delivery in August of 2021. Now, do understand that that this isn't merely a production date, but a delivery date.\nYou should have the Tam'n\u00fder\u2014a', a Fantasy Oracle by the end August 2021 at the latest. We have also listed delivery this far in the future as we have received word that there have been delays with PrintNinja production due to COVID-19.\nThat being said, rest assured that I will keep you informed every bit of the way with frequent updates as far as the completion of art and production goes, and when I will be shipping out your deck as well!\nPLEASE NOTE: Canada Post has stopped shipment to certain countries due to COVID-19. You can find the list here.\nWe will honour purchases made from these countries, and ship ASAP once we have the product and Canada Post resumes shipment there. The countries affected are the only ones who we are not guaranteeing to be delivered to by the end of August 2021.\nFurthermore, please understand that we have two delivery dates. If you have backed us where the rewards are solely DIGITAL, your delivery date is February 2021. \nIf your chosen reward includes anything PHYSICAL (even if it does come with digital rewards); you will get your rewards all at once August 2021.\nThe Lovers; Examples of the Digital Print images\nThe Stretch Goals of our Kickstarter project are to ultimately transform the Tam'n\u00fder\u2014a', a Fantasy Oracle into a true work of art. \n\n               These Stretch Goals include:\nBlue Core Standard - 280 gsm\n\n               Finish Type; VARNISH; Gilded Edges to the deck (each card)\n  Custom-sized TWO-PIECE BOX; Laminated; gloss finish\n\n               Extra addition of Foil Stamping of\n               \"Tam'n\u00fder\u2014a', a Fantasy Oracle\" on each box\n  Instructions; printed in FULL COLOUR w/ Gloss Finish; 24 pgs\n  Card Backs printed with Metallic Ink\n  And the Stretch Goals will be hit in the following order:\nInstructions; printed in FULL COLOUR w/ Gloss Finish; 24 pgs\n               WILL BE UNLOCKED @ $20,320 CAD \nBlue Core Standard - 280 gsm\n               Finish Type; VARNISH; Gilded Edges to the deck (each card) \n               WILL BE UNLOCKED @ $21,700 CAD \nCustom-sized TWO-PIECE BOX; Laminated; gloss finish\n               WILL BE UNLOCKED @ $23,300 CAD \nFoil Stamping of \"Tam'n\u00fder\u2014a', a Fantasy Oracle\" on each box\n               WILL BE UNLOCKED @ $23,750 CAD \nCard Backs printed with Metallic Ink\n               WILL BE UNLOCKED @ $24,148.63 CAD \nBasic Card Back to Silver Ink Card Back\n_________________________________________________________\nStill want to know more about the Deck? Keep reading! \nWe wanted to give you more of a peek into our process and help you understand the deck better if you wanted to know. \nIf, however, you're satisfied, you don't need to keep reading below. :D\nLet's give you an example of a popular Mundane Reading next! In the United (Lovers) Spread, four cards are drawn and laid out in a single row, guidance sought when one is ready to take a further step with a lover. Only four cards of the Oracle Deck, The Lovers (Y'l, Jn & \u00d6x and Nue) are used, and the meaning of the reading attaches to the order of the cards first and foremost. \nSample reading of the United (Lovers) Spread\nHere is a breakdown of what we have designed for them and how they should be interpreted when doing a reading:\nCards 6,7,8 & 9 - The Lovers (Y'l, Jn & \u00d6x, Nue - 4 cards, Nue is considered to balance out the negative of the Y'l, Jn & \u00d6x cards, although not entirely)\nY'l - friendship, platonic love, the beginning of a new relationship (as lovers, friends or even business), crush or infatuation\nJn - lessons learned through suffering and loss, the perils of greed, jealousy and envy, obsession, destructive passions (cannot be reversed)\n\u00d6x - mature enduring love, marriage, balanced relationship, actively working towards such things\nNue, The Moon, God of Companionship - companionship, acceptance of others as they are, being faithful, unconditional love\nIn a Mundane reading, these cards are almost always interpreted according to the meanings above in the context of relationships, with Jn considered a challenging card, and Nue being considered a positive beneficial card (except when reversed, when it may signify that the querent is taken for granted or stuck in a toxic relationship).\n  If two or more of the Lovers cards appear together in a reading, then the querent must resolve a situation revolving around relationships and which has the potential of becoming highly destructive. Nue remains a beneficial card, but Jn and either Y\u2019l or \u00d6x or both is considered a disastrous combination.\n  Equally negative is a reading where the Q'Tam'\u0161m\u0103 (Mother of All) and Jn appear together, in which case the querent is advised of potential karmic effects of their past or current actions. At the opposite, the Jn and Uu'krieuvan (Death) cards together could mean redemption from past misdeeds.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhen it comes to risks, it is all about cost. The major hurdle is affording the art by Yayu, which we are hoping, with appropriate funding to be done by the end of November 2020. Then comes the production of the cards. \n\nIn addition to the production of the deck is the effect of the infamous COVID-19. As we broach a new world, so far the company we have chosen to produce the cards (PrintNinja) says there have been some delays in production. That does not mean that the project will not be delivered ever though. I have high hopes and faith that COVID-19 won't delay anything too too badly, but in case it does happen, I will communicate it with you all as soon as I know. This is also why the delivery date is projected at August 2021; to give leeway for any hiccups in production along the way.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: Canada Post has stopped shipment to certain countries due to COVID-19.

This new Mythic line of Elder Dice is designed around three new arcane symbols, with the symbol replacing the highest value on each die. With this new line of Mythic Elder Dice, each set of polyhedral dice will have an additional d20 in each box, coming with ten dice total (two d20s, one d12, one d10, one d%, one d8, three d6, and one d4).\nEach set comes packaged in a matching spellbook box with a magnetic closure, gold foil, spot gloss, and lore card. We also have sets of 9 six-sided dice as well as polyhedral booster packs that contain an extra 3d4, d6 and 2d10. We are also introducing our new ritual candle dice tubes that will look great on your shelf or at the gaming table. These candle tubes can hold up to ten dice and can also be used as a miniature dice cup for rolling in confined spaces. \nPrototypes Shown Above.\n                  Each set of Elder Dice contains a complete set of ten polyhedral gaming dice: 1 d4, 3 d6s, 1 d8, 1 d10, 1 d%, 1 d12, and 2 d20s.

It's a privilege to be entrusted by so many people to bring this project to life. We will work hard to make sure it is as smooth as can be. Together David and Heath have completed many Kickstarter campaigns. Each Kickstarter project brings many valuable lessons learned. Because of our experience, we feel very confident in our ability to deliver a quality product to you.\n\nWe have allotted time to finalize the project at the conclusion of the campaign, and then we will roll right into production. We have been working with our manufacturing partners in China for months on these Elder Dice designs to be sure the manufacturing process goes as smoothly as possible, however, making the new candle holder is something we have never done before. There is always the potential for delay when working with a new manufacturer. We have a strong relationship with our fulfillment partner. These relationships are incredibly important and give us confidence in our ability to deliver your rewards in a safe and economical manner.\n\nHowever, with our experience, we know that unexpected issues can arise during the production process. Final preparations for manufacturing after the Kickstarter campaign could take longer than expected. There can be manufacturing delays that are beyond our control. When the product is inspected for quality control, a flaw could be found and a part may have to be remade. Molds may breakdown and have to be recreated. We will not sacrifice quality, even if it pushes the schedule back!\n\nThere can also be delays with shipping. Products can be delayed at sea, there may be extended customs inspections, and even adverse weather conditions may slow down local delivery. Deadly pandemics may strike, causing governments to shut down commerce either regionally or globally.\n\nBut, when you support Elder Dice, we promise to keep you up to date about its progress from the campaign\u2019s close all the way to when the dice are shipped.

However, when the heart bleeds and becomes so heavy that our legs can no longer carry us, sometimes we forget it. Then you collapse in the dark, alone like drifting dust in the universe.\nI created the Mornes Plaines of Arcanya to help those who go through life's trials not to forget it, and to remember that even in the darkest moments, each of us has an infinite source of light, and unsuspected resources to rise again, stronger and greater than we were before.\nThe world of Arcanya seems hopelessly lost. This is a kingdom where the abyss buries every living thing. The 4 elements, Earth (the Pentacles), Air (the Swords), Water (the Cups) and Fire (the Wands) have given way to Stones, Wind, Rain and Ashes.\nYet it is a kingdom that belongs to you to cross, alongside the Magician, Justice, the Emperor or the Star to explore your own universe, to mobilize your own forces and your own resources, whose existence you have sometimes forgotten. You are the only person capable of repelling your Darkness. Have faith in yourself, and soon the Sun will illuminate again the Mornes Plaines of Arcanya.\nHere is an extract from the sublime symphonic orchestration composed by Lisa Van Hal, and a small note from soloist singer Julie Elven, who will sing on the main theme of Arcanya.\nPLAY\n\nJulie Elven is a soundtrack and filmscore vocalist. She has contributed as a soloist to major video games such as Horizon Zero Dawn, League of Legends, World of Warcraft, Hearthstone, Honor of Kings, Star Citizen, Tomb Raider and more.

This video dont explain the detailed rules, it just give you a first look on the type of game.\nThe booklet includes French and English translations from the outset.\nDon't worry : Strength will wear its traditional number (11) and Justice the 8.\n These cards illustrate the Stretch goal 2 : \"free addition of the inverted Strength and Justice cards\".\nThe remaining cards have already been studied and designed, but having them drawn by Anna represents an important workload, in terms of time and means, which only the project funding will be able to complete.\nThe Sacred Grimoire of the High Priestess, an authentic and imposing 220-page book, created by hand (see video below). You can order your copy at the same time as the deck (10 books available).\nPLAY\n\n (Sold without frame)\nThe longest side of a sticker will measure 3,15\u2032\n\u2013 Why propose a \u20ac25,000 project and set a first funding target at \u20ac18,000 ? \u2013\n\n    The minimum objective of \u20ac18 000 will not allow the creation of the entire Arcanya universe, in its luxurious version and with its soundtrack, but it will allow the project to exist in a standard version, even if the initial objective is not reached. You will be able to have your deck in hand, with its 78 cards and its astounding atmosphere.\nTo show you the prices in dollars, the amounts in euros have been converted at the time of the campaign launch. Slight variations may occur until final settlement. In case of doubt, only the amounts in euros are authentic.\nWhen you choose an offer, you will still be able to modify the amount you wish to donate (see the image above). You will not be able to give less, but you can always give more. This is the system that will allow you to add the options you want.\nExample 1 : If you have chosen the Asabel Pledge (i.e. the deck + the 3 exclusive cards for 89\u20ac/$100), but you want to add the novel and 3 posters, you will just have to add the price of the novel (+17\u20ac/$20) and the price of 3 posters (12\u20ac x 3 = +36\u20ac/$40) to the normal price of the chosen offer (89\u20ac + 17\u20ac +36\u20ac = 142\u20ac/$160). You will then have to select the Asabel Pledge and indicate an amount of 142\u20ac. (Reminder : the best offer, the \u201call-inclusive\u201d pack, is 119\u20ac/$132 for 48 hours)\nExample 2 : You don\u2019t want to buy the game, but you would still like the novel and the soundtrack ? As options are available for all offers, you can select the Hildmar Pledge (8\u20ac) and add +17\u20ac (novel) and +15\u20ac (soundtrack). You will therefore need to choose the Hildmar Pledge and indicate an amount (8\u20ac+17\u20ac+15\u20ac) of 40\u20ac/45$.\nYOU WILL BE ABLE TO SPECIFY THE POSTERS YOU WANT AND ALL THE DETAILS OF YOUR COMMITMENT AT THE END OF THE CAMPAIGN IN THE PLEDGE MANAGER. IT IS ALSO AT THIS STAGE THAT THE SHIPPING COSTS WILL BE ADDED.\nFor estimations, the shipping costs will be about 5\u20ac (without taxes) for recipients located in France, about 10\u20ac (without taxes) for recipients located in Europe, excluding the UK and Switzerland, and about 15\u20ac (without taxes) for the other recipients. These amounts will be degressive from certain stretch goals, until they are free.\nBONUS : as a bonus, here\u2019s a short film / trailer that was directed by Sebastien Weiss and Nico Pfister Photography with LucioleS Cosplay, and which nicely illustrates the universe of Arcanya.\n    Hope you\u2019ll enjoy !\nPLAY", "risks": "Risks and challenges\n- The standard version Vs The Deluxe version :\nThe minimum objective of \u20ac18 000 will not allow the creation of the entire Arcanya universe, in its luxurious Deluxe version and with its soundtrack, but it will allow the project to exist in a standard version, even if the initial objective is not reached. You will be able to have your deck in hand, with its 78 cards and its astounding atmosphere.\n\n- Delivery schedules :\nMost of the manufacturing elements are under control and we believe we have estimated them as close as possible to reality. However, some elements are totally out of our control and could cause delays in delivery.\n\n1) In 2021, the celebration of the New Moon (Chinese New Year) is scheduled for February 12, 2021. This date is an important celebration in China and industrial activities (including the printing of our cards) are suspended for 15 days. If we manage to ship the products before this date, there will be no consequence on the delivery times, otherwise, this holiday period will have to be taken into account.\n\n2) Of course, our delivery schedule will depend on the evolution of COVID-19 in China and France, but also in your country of residence.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nReusability and recyclability\nThe cardboard used for shipping packages is 100% recycled and PEFC certified.\nSomething else\n- To avoid overproducing plastic CD covers, plastic inserts, printing a cover and back cover, and having to wrap everything in plastic film, we decided to produce the OST only in digital format.

Sitting down at a quiet cafe to peruse the latest comics about the daily life of a magic user, articles about centering oneself, and DIYs for new ways to incorporate intention into your daily routine, Hazel offers kindly words of guidance and peace of mind in the midst of the busy pace of modern life.\nFull of more wonderfully witchy content than ever, at 5.5\" x 8.5\", this 76-page issue is no exception to our dedication to bringing heartfelt and joyous stories and artwork into your hands. Hazel's enchanted forest atmosphere brings us to a place where every moment is full of magic to discover, and every day is a celebration.\nThis is the LAST year of Hazel! It's sad to let it go, but this is still a celebration for us to be able to put out one last issue full of wonder and serenity. We want to make it extra special by including all kinds of new merch, extra gifts as the campaign goes on, and maybe even some stretch goals...! \nPrevious spreads from Issue IV\nOur big dream stretch goal is to bring back Issue I of Hazel for reprinting. There were only 100 copies initially printed, and all but a few have sold out. The remainder are stowed away in the Cottonbook Press library. Although digital versions of the books have always been available, we've received many requests to bring back the physical copy of Issue I. If we get enough support this year, as a major stretch goal, we would love to produce at least 100 more copies for our readers. It would still be on the lighter white paper of the original book, but with a cover stock that matches issues 3, 4, and 5.\nHazel Issue I, currently out of print, which we're hoping to reprint this year if we surpass our goal\nWhy a zine? Zines, small circulation publications getting their name from the word \"magazine,\" have always been a tool for those without means to get their ideas out into the world. We've had our amazing creators go out and have great successes after Hazel, even if all they needed from us was the confidence boost of seeing their first published work. In providing a space for underrepresented and beginning creators to show their talents and stories, we've been so proud to see former contributors go on to get book deals, launch illustration careers, and publish their own zines! \nRaising up the voices of underrepresented creators is one of the things we strive for with Hazel. Witch culture has been a haven for not only women who don't fit the mold, but also gender non-conforming people, trans people, and nonbinary people, and people of all races who identify as such. We celebrate that aspect in the making of this zine, bringing together all kinds of voices. Past issues have featured such incredible talents as Sudi Rouhi, Ragon Dickard, Tori Sharp, Jenny Park, and Sydney Anderson as well as budding new talent with clever ideas to share with our readership. These amazing artists, writers, and DIY instructors contribute beautiful and meaningful content year after year, elevating the emanations of our pages with each new issue. \n Our stunningly talented team of magic-makers this year includes: \nAvina-kei\nV. C. Slade\nVictoria Leeder\nKasia K.\nLulu VanHoagland\nSydney Anderson\nAllison Kupatt\nJennifer Chan\nPinceau Arc-en-Ciel\nNatalia Lopes\nlittlemousedeer\nKucera Bishop\nKirsten Petersen\nPenelopea\nPetrina Cheng-Tatara\nLucy Kagan\nMaxine Frizz\nJessica Mejias\nLara Smith\nCaroline Humphrey\nThais Lopes\nEllenor Mererid\nMelissa Brinks\nCody Tenaglia\nLibby Reed\nThali Demeter\nThanks to our consistently charming and supportive readers, we have been able to lift up the voices of talented creators of diverse genders, creating a place for their work to shine in an often dark landscape. Our backers on Kickstarter have allowed these luminaries to glow even when marginalized creators often struggle to thrive in a system that pushes them to the background. An essential element of witchcraft is finding power in ourselves and our communities, where we have been told there is none. \nSample pages by Caroline Humphries (left) and Jennifer Chan (right)\nSample pages by Maxine Frizz (left) and Natalia Lopes and Thais Lopes (right)\n Whether your magic is artwork, storytelling, coding, baking, or building, you have the power to make things that are greater than the sum of their parts. When we read and write Hazel, we have the opportunity to take part in a shared experience, an activity that connects us. Your support of Hazel is an act that strengthens us, and enhances the creative process. Together, we have magic.\nWhen you back Hazel on Kickstarter, you are supporting that magic, participating in a give and take that rewards both sides. We have some beautiful extra gifts to share with you this year, and the more we are able to raise, the more rewards we'd love to add on!\n A Digital Copy of Hazel Issue V & the whole Hazel library as PDFs \nA physical copy of Hazel Issue V and the Hazel library (not including out-of-print Issue 1)\nOur physical copies of the whole Hazel set will not include Issue I, which is currently out of print. If we can raise enough funds, we would love to reprint Hazel Issue I and be able to provide that option. What can you do to help us get there? 1. Back Hazel by pledging at any level to help us reach our funding goal. 2. Spread the word to friends, family, social media -- anyone you think would be interested! 3. Follow us on social media and give our posts some love (this will help us extend our reach and share Hazel with many many more!). \nPrevious issue in physical form\nWooden Pins:\nHazel V wooden pin design & mockup\nLast year's pins are pictured below to give you a sense of how this year's designs (above) will look in real life! \nPast wooden pin rewards\nCommissions (Limited Availability):\nOur highest tier, Patron of the Light Arts, allows you to support an artist directly from our enchanted trio of creators this year, Sydney Anderson, Cody Tenaglia, and Lucy Kagan. Wow, wait, let me amend that! The three slots quickly disappeared, so we added three new artists! Now, Lulu VanHoagland, Lara Smith, and Pinceau Arc-en-Ciel join our group of artists for commission. $100 of your pledge will go straight to the artist, who will create a custom 5\" x 5\" piece of artwork just for you, as you work with them to decide on the perfect subject (for example, one figure would be ideal, maximum two from the waist up, and they'd love to get your input on things and colors you like). Their artwork is featured below.   \nHow this works: Message us right away to reserve the artist of your choice! We can then put you in touch with that artist after the campaign ends to get you started. \nThree new artists added! littlemousedeer, Jennifer Chan, and Victoria Leeder are now available for commission - message us to claim your artist of choice!\n Stretch Goals: Additional wooden pins, digital goodies, stickers, and more! \nWow, we reached funding within our first three days! Thank you SO SO MUCH for making that possible! We're so excited to already be able to share with you some of our extra goals we were hoping for, and maybe we'll even get to reveal more along the way!  \nStretch Goal #3 unlocked! All contributors receive a raise for their incredible work! Next stretch goal at $8K: Tote bags!\nGoal unlocked: Baking tutorial video with Kirsten Petersen! Next: Contributor raises and a guided meditation audio recording!\nTotes: \nAt $8K, we'll unlock a tote bag design with a fictional Witches in Residence in the Evergreen Mountains design, so we can all imagine we had a wonderful summer at a witches' retreat in the woods!\nWe'd love to have even more Hazel merch this year, so we can go out with a bang! Of course, it's enough for us to just print this last issue, which is why we have a limited amount of extras included in our main goal this year. But as a last hurrah, we want to make all the fun witchy goods we've been dreaming of, so the more support we get, the more merch we can unlock with stretch goals along the way. Check out the reward tiers to see which one has the right combination of goodies for you.\nMore than the witch aesthetic, Hazel has heart. Every story and essay puts its heart on display, conjuring true connections with our readers. In reading Hazel, we hope to share a bit of ourselves, so that all of us, wherever we are, can feel seen by each other across any distance of time and space. The Spirit issue of Hazel is about the spirit within all of us, within each living thing, whatever you call it, and how we go about life respecting that quality of each being. For those of us in marginalized groups that feel that spirit within us denied, ignored, and trampled upon, this is a truly important and meaningful topic, and we can't wait to show you all the wonderful ways our creators have approached it.  \nSample pages by Libby Reed (left) and Lara Smith (right)\nHow is the money used?\nBy backing Hazel on Kickstarter, you're supporting the work and creative life of independent artists of all sorts. While the majority of the money from this budget goes toward our printing costs and rewards manufacturing, we strive to be able to give our contributors as much compensation for their wonderful work as possible. Honestly, with the amount of work and skill that our creators put into Hazel, their contributions are essentially a donation given for the love of Hazel, and I would value them at well over what I've been able to pay them. The more this campaign can raise, the more we will be able to pay our artists what they deserve. That's why we're so thankful to have such a loving and nurturing audience as the Hazel readership, who understands the importance of giving back to those who give us such incredible gifts. Thank you.\nSample pages by Syndey Anderson (left) and Lulu VanHoagland (right)", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nHaving produced Hazel for the past four years prior, we have learned so much about how to anticipate and work with risks and challenges. Our biggest risk is always not meeting our goal, and not being able to compensate our incredible contributors for their work. Next to that, if you ask any Kickstarter runner, you'll hear them say that shipping is a factor that is often very difficult to predict. Last year, we did lose some money on shipping to Canada that cost more than before. This is why we've never offered international shipping outside of North America, as frustrating as it is. We've done what we can to recalculate shipping in our cost calculations this year, but it is a challenge point for us with so many unknowns.\n\nAnother difficulty point is promotion. After the lessons learned from the first Kickstarter we launched, we've always managed to get funded by word of mouth and social media marketing, but part of the challenge of featuring creators with little to no audience yet is that our network has its limits. We're doing the best we can this year to reach for a higher goal for funding and reach for a wider audience at the same time, and with the help of our backers, we're hoping to surpass all previous goals as we grow even more this year than we have in the past.\n\nWe are confident that upon reaching our goal, we can get all the rewards out there to our backers in a timely manner, so if we can get the help we need, we're ready to supply the goods! Thank you so much for taking the time to support our book.\n\nThank you,\nLucy Kagan\nEditor, Contributor, and Publisher of Hazel: A Witches' Lifestyle Zine\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Spell of Abundance", "descp": "For your well-wishes in Hazel's success, we offer our heartfelt thanks and warmest wishes for joy and abundance in your life.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2020"}], "stat": ["1 backer"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 2 or more", "title": "Helping Hand", "descp": "We know this is a very difficult time for a lot of people.

The third issue script is complete and with your help we can go full speed ahead to commission art production and make issue #3 a reality!\nThanks for checking out my Kickstarter and Joining the Movement!\nI Am Hexed is a supernatural political thriller. There\u2019s magic, mystery, personal drama, and an accidentally carnivorous plant.\nWitches have been a part of the political fabric of Washington D.C. since it was founded. It\u2019s only since the 1960s that witches stood together and fought to take back the word \u201cHexed\u201d. A movement was ignited when witches came out of the shadows and proudly showed off their broomsticks. \nNow with the struggle for equality ongoing, Charlotte \"Charlie\" Helm, a junior staff member for Senator Royce, has been thrust into the murky and dangerous waters of political games between witches and their adversaries. Charlie goes on the run to find out who's behind it with her ex-girlfriend Jaya and her friend Florence, who is a witch well versed in science-magic. \nWill Charlie find out why the witch authorities are after her before they find her?!\n\nKirsten Thompson is a comic writer and editor based in the Pacific Northwest.

That being said, some of the things that rely on external production (The manufacture of rewards, logistics of packing & shipping individual rewards) may cause some delays. \n\nDepending on the print quantity, we may choose to print our books in Canada or overseas. If so, there could be problems such as our books being held in customs, and longer shipping times. I have spent the past eight months planning and refining this project.\n\nI have accounted for these potential problems and worked them into our schedule. \nEveryone will be updated every step of the way, throughout the entire production process. Of course, we will notify you of any setbacks that may arise. \n\nThank you for casting your bit of magic on I Am Hexed!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""},

Super compact, super lightweight and super bright.\nThe battery on our prototypes was 1000mAh.  In testing we have measured run times at approx:\n95 mins at MAX | 140 mins at MID | 240 mins at LOW.\nAnd full charge from flat is around 2 hrs. *Subject to battery age and weather conditions.\nBut with our stretch goals achieved, we can now upgrade the size of this battery by 1.5X to a 1500mAh battery - which will increase these timings.\nUSB-C allows for operation while charging, so if a need ever arises the unit can be run from a power source.\nAs we are injection moulding the diffusion panel, we will have full control of elements that effect the panel opacity (we'll be experimenting with the mix of composite ingredients / diffusing powders that give a glow effect etc). Once we have the tooling complete and can experiment with these options, fine tuning will take place to balance the LED outputs VS the diffusion opacity. As a result run times may vary up or down slightly in final production model.\nWhile CRI is a commonly cited score, as a film professional, a more important rating is the Television Lighting Consistency Index or TLCI.  It also runs from 0-100.  Our LED rating of 98+ puts us in the range where any colour variation is so small, a film colourist would not consider correcting it.  \n\nWe've been hard at work over the past three weeks confirming the final details of our tooling setup - we have paid and signed our contract and have been working on the finer points of the design, with tool cutting due to commence any day. We have opted to work with a higher precision tooling company as it will both allow us to produce more units faster, and also deliver a product with a higher quality finish.  \nWe're also excited to announce that since we can now order at higher volume, we have been able to negotiate some rates and add a couple of pretty cool features that will now be shipped with every BIGSOFTI.\nAnd after hitting our $650K Stretch Goal today - every single BIGSOFTI shipped to every backer will now have a 1500mAh battery!\n\nMy name is Al Morrow, I'm a Sydney-based TV commercial director who\u2019s worked with global brands in both Australia and the US for over a decade.  \nI'm the guy who walks into a room and has to fight the urge to adjust the lights. Lighting quality literally affects how we see the world, and yet so many people hardly give it enough thought.\nAl Morrow lining up the frame on recent Volkswagen TV Commercial.\nI know how important lighting is when filming, well, anything and because I shoot photos and videos on my phone all the time, I wanted to bring the same kind of high-quality light that I use on my film sets to my mobile.\nEven though I\u2019d been thinking of ways to bring film lighting to my phone, my \u2018aha\u2019 moment for BIGSOFTI didn\u2019t come on set or even during a shoot. It came one day in the car. My wife was driving and her sister was in the backseat; taking selfie after selfie. She was holding up a jacket to cut out the direct sunlight and complaining that her photos either had too many hard shadows or were being blasted by the phone flash.\nI commented to her, that without her knowing it, she was cutting and shaping light in a similar way that we would on a film set and that if she wanted full control of her image, she\u2019d need to have a small, powerful, soft light with her. Her face lit up (no pun intended) 'that would be great!'. Many months later, she was the first person we started our tests on, comparing our soft light to the hard light of the phone flash.\nNote the harsh light and hard focussed shadow from the single point LED on the phone (top left) VS much softer spread from BIGSOFTI (top right).\nThat was when I realised this was not just a product I would use. Everyone (director or not), uses cameras and anyone shooting photos or videos needs good light.\nThe first thing I did when I got home that evening was to look at what products already existed in this space. There were phone cases that seemed cumbersome. Products that were made with cheap, low-quality LEDs. Lighting attachments that were too big, too heavy, too expensive.\nThere seemed to be a gap in the market! I was curious to see if we could address these design flaws and make something better - and the BIGSOFTI journey began.\nBIGSOFTI began with me in my office pulling apart LED products I bought on ebay and hacking bits together but it really shifted gear when I brought on the team at Vert Design. \nI was impressed by both their enthusiasm and their experience (they had designed products for clients such as SONY, INTEL, BMW and DEUS among others) and, from the outset, our partnership was a perfect combination of my knowledge of lighting and photography and their passion for user-focused design.\nWe set off on two things: 1. Start on initial designs. 2. Find the right manufacturing partner.\nThroughout the process, Head Designer Andrew Simpson spoke about product design being a 'swinging pendulum' between tech functionality and human interaction. Swing too far in one direction you lose the core practicality of the product, too far in the other direction and you lose the great user experience. We needed to make a product that was the perfect combination of both.\nInitially, we created a light panel that would attach to the underside of a flip-out phone case. We found that while the function of the light module worked well, the user interaction with the design was lacking. We showed it to family, friends and colleagues who loved the effect of the lighting, but not the experience so we went back to the drawing board.\nWe explored fixed universal clips, magnetic blocks, locking rubber lugs, even a metal arm and shoe mount. We were split on the clip VS rubber lug and so decided to run some market research through the digital platform OnePulse, asking a focus group of 500 men and women 18-35, across the UK and US which design they preferred. A resounding eighty-five per cent said the clip-on design.\nOur direction became very clear. Several iterations later, we now have a rotating, removable mechanism (patent pending), which houses a universal clip for all leading smartphone, tablet and laptop brands. Plus the additional features of a cold shoe camera mount with \u00bc\u201d 20 thread mount and the 3M Adhesive Mount for general surfaces. It\u2019s this simple versatility that helps put BIGSOFTI into its own category - being effortlessly transferrable across all your devices. \nWe had our design, now we needed to get it made. After a false start with our initial manufacturer (bad communication, high costs, lack of knowledge and lack of passion about the product) we were put in touch with a man named Hunter Ho; an LED lighting product specialist.\nDuring our first meeting with Hunter, we discussed the technical requirements of LED numbers, size, spacing and distance, colour temp,  CRI and TLCI ratings, the diffusing materials, batteries and charge times, circuits and regulatory approval checks. Hunter had an answer to all our questions and within a few days had sent us itemised quotes with unit numbers, costs, recommendations and timelines.\nWith Hunter\u2019s input we were able to improve the lighting board and PCB layout, update the charge port to USB-C and increase the battery size and run time.  But most importantly, we were able to update the quality of our LEDs. We are now working with specialised, photography grade BI-COLOUR LEDs, so new that they may have never been used in a device this small before. They deliver changeable colour temperature functionality - with options for all scenarios - DAYLIGHT (5500K), TUNGSTEN (3000K) and a CLEAN MIX (4000K). Which means awesome colour reproduction for better images. We are super confident in our design and just as confident in our manufacturer. \nDuring these uncertain times in the world, shipping costs have gone up significantly, however, we believe these prices should return to normal as the global situation improves. To therefore minimise costs for our backers, we will not be charging the current higher shipping charges at the time of pledging.\nShipping, Taxes (and VAT / GST) will be calculated and paid for towards the end of the campaign, just before we ship out to our supporters.  This is being managed through BackerKit who will be in contact via email. \nWe will be working hard to secure you the best shipping prices. The good news is that BIGSOFTI is small and lightweight, so any multipack purchases will be charged as only single postage fees, so please consider ordering for someone else too, to help us cut down on shipping costs and air miles.\nWe were always planning to launch BIGSOFTI in the first few months of this year, and obviously things have been a little held up by this very strange and difficult time out there.\nWe\u2019ve stayed across developments of COVID-19 from the very beginning, as news of the pandemic first began to spread in China. We have adjusted our delivery timelines to take into consideration any delays that might be encountered as we move into tooling and production.\nCOVID-19 is certainly going to impact the way we work and communicate for the next little while. There is generally a movement towards remote working and this is only going to increase, and with that, comes adjusting to the new norm of endless video calls both for personal and business reasons. \nWe know there is a lot about social distancing that has been difficult.  Never-ending video calls is just one minor impact of the current situation.  But if BIGSOFTI can help solve this one little problem then great.\nWe couldn't have got where we are today, without lots of help from family and friends. This whole thing has been done as lean as possible. From learning how to build a website, to hassling my poor friends to be in the videos. Harassing my brother Matt to help me film things. To asking my wife Jan for feedback during scripting. And a couple of favours finishing the content with Chris at White Chocolate in Darlington, and Tone at Rumble Studios in Chippendale. So to all those people - a huge thanks. Literally could not have done it without you all.\nChief Technology Cat analysing LED spectrum lab reports. LOL - No he's not. He's a moron.\nThis project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 1,100+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $460M raised between them.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have been working on developing BIGSOFTI for nearly 24 months now and have built some great working relationships with our manufacturing partners.\n\nIf we are successful with our campaign, the team are ready to push the button on the tool making. As soon as we hit our funding goal, we can afford to pay the invoice at the factory to begin tooling.\n\nWe have every element fully costed out - so know exactly how to deliver BIGSOFTI out to customers - but as professionals with very high standards, we have identified a few risks that you should be made aware of that include:\n\n\n1 - Manufacturing Schedule\n \nWe know things are going to be a little backed up with the factories as China moves back to full capacity, and this has been factored into our production timings. We have outlined a longer delivery time-frame of 6 months in the hopes that we will end up being able to deliver earlier than expected. \n\nWe are working with a very experienced mould maker to manage our injection moulding process and a top electronic engineer and LED consultant to drive the component acquisition and circuitry construction.\n\nIt is critical to fully 'tune' the injection mould tooling to ensure we deliver BIGSOFTI to our high standards. The process of 'tuning the mould' has been described as sometimes more art than science. It can be quick or a can take a few passes to refine. The time to do this has been factored in, but if they nail it quickly, then it might be faster. But we will not be producing the first run of product until we are happy with the samples to make sure you will be too.\n\nWe can guarantee however to be fully transparent with communication updates so you guys know exactly how things are moving along. We want to make sure you love BIGSOFTI as much as we do - and won't ship until we know you will.\n\n\n2 - Shipping and Handling\n\nWe think it's important to get BIGSOFTI out to you guys nice and quickly, but at the lowest cost possible.\nGlobal freight and shipping is currently under the weight of massive demand and the road blocks of fewer flights and tighter borders. As such, costs for shipping are up (sometimes 2-3X) - which unfortunately is driving up our material and manufacturing costs somewhat, but this is something that we are absorbing at this stage to get BIGSOFTI off the ground.\n\nOur shipping team are set to pack and send BIGSOFTI as soon as it's ready to go - but as with any postage, we cannot control the amount of time it takes once it leaves our warehouse. Global freight is currently burdened during this health crisis so timings and costings will be effected. We hope by the time we are ready to ship, that access has returned to some level of normality. But our plan is to maintain good constant communication with all backers so everyone is kept well informed.\n\nIn order to give you the most competitive pricing on shipping, we will not be charging shipping and taxes through Kickstarter but will be charging it closer to our delivery dates through BackerKit. With costs far higher than normal at the moment, but the assumption that things should return closer to normal over the next few months, we hope to get BIGSOFTI out to you guys for the cheapest possible price. \n\nWe're working through trusted partners here so we're confident things will be fine, but please be patient as sometimes little hiccups in their system can cause a short (but understandably annoying) delay. \n\n\n3 - Minimum Orders\n\nBacking our project is not the same thing as buying an off the shelf photography light. It is about supporting our idea that professional lighting principles should be available simply and easily across all your devices. \n\nTo make this possible, we need to build enough support here in the KICKSTARTER community to get us over the line. This support will finally help us bring all our hours of research and development to life in BIGSOFTI.\n\nTo help make this idea a reality, we need your help in spreading the word.\n\nIf you like the look of BIGSOFTI, please click the green button and back our campaign. And please share it with anyone you think might also benefit from better quality lighting in their pocket. \n\nEvery pledge we get helps bring us one step closer to getting BIGSOFTI into your hands, as quickly as possible, and for the lowest possible price.

It is a story where fantasy and horror meet a torrid Western romance, full of betrayal, terrifying power, and the struggle of two men rebuilding their relationship.\nCONTENT WARNING: While it is first and foremost a supernatural romantic drama, this book contains queer erotic content, light body horror, and physical violence (including moments of visual gore). I ask everyone to keep all responses, inquiries, and other communications appropriate. You must be of legal age to contribute to this campaign.\nSHIPPING NOTE: Before you read any further, if you back this campaign, remember that shipping will be charged at a later date! I'll be using PledgeManager to gather surveys and shipping costs next year, so I don't have to charge you more than what's needed.\nConcept art for BULLISH.\nThis campaign is to help fund the production and printing of the graphic novel. In addition, the entire process of this book- scripting, research, editing, art generation, and book design- will be documented for all backers. Bi-monthly updates will be used to show progress, all of which will be collected into a digital PDF for backers at the end. There are minimal stretch goals for this campaign to keep things succinct. Think of it like a pre-order system, but you also get a first hand look into how the magic is made every step of the way!\nOur story focuses on the beginning of a new romance between two men in the fictional town of Labrinne, TX. Bill Black, a newly-arrived outsider in search of temporary work, meets Javier Rosales, the well beloved owner of the town's sprawling ranch. Almost immediately, the two men find in each other a curious rapport, and Javier hires him on to help at the ranch. Weeks turn to months...\nPage excerpt from BULLISH.\n...and a temporary hire turns into a budding relationship. However, when Javier discovers what appears to be his farmhand-turned-lover looting his safe in the dead of night, he's devastated. Pain quickly becomes anger, and Bill soon discovers his partner possesses terrifying magical power as he is brutally cursed into the form of the infamous Minotaur of Greco-Roman myth.\nPage excerpt from BULLISH.\nThe next morning rises, and the fraught lovers must now grapple with one another's violent betrayals as they struggle to find a path forward. Javier wrestles with what he's done, and if he can ever forgive the man he trusted his heart to. Meanwhile, trapped within his new beastly form, Bill tries to avoid incurring further supernatural wrath as his secret life threatens to destroy their love and the town...\nRough page excerpts from BULLISH.\nKey character concept art for BULLISH.\nThe original illustration of our protagonists came about from a warm-up exercise in May. I was immediately intrigued by the idea of a ranch owner and his beastly lover, finding myself drifting back to the concept over and over. Soon, more sketches appeared, thumbnails for a short scene were drawn up, and before I knew it, it had spiraled out of control into the campaign you see today!\nCharacter sketches for Javier.\nJavier Rosales is the owner of the only ranch in the tiny town of Labrinne. In his late 40s, he runs it by himself, much to the surprise of outsiders. A warm and welcoming man, he often holds gatherings and celebrations for the community on his property, earning him the title 'Papa Rosa' from many of the town children. Long separated from his last partner, Javier was content with sharing his affection with the town- until Bill arrives, and he takes a chance on love one more time...\nCharacter sketches for Bill.\nBill Black is a man hiding secrets that he no longer wishes to hold. Always sought after for his brawn, he prides himself in his usefulness- no matter the details of the job. Now in his 30s and growing wary of those he works for, life finds him in Labrinne for mysterious reasons... reasons he fears will undo the unexpected love he's grown for Javier, the town, and the new life he's made.\nThe book itself is planned to be approximately 176 pages in black and white, 6.5 x 5.5 inches, with a matte finish softcover. Two stretch goals have been unlocked to help really make this book stand out with deckled page edges and french flaps, and will be applied to all physical reward tiers. \nA closer look at the book specs and design details!\nA rough cover mockup for the book - not final.\nThe third stretch goal is a simple one - a 16 page, 18+ post-epilogue comic that will be exclusive to backers of the campaign. Now unlocked, all tiers will receive it either as a digital PDF or physical booklet, depending on the reward chosen! The content and mood of this stretch goal will be decided by backer polls later in the production cycle. Sweet and wholesome, dark and sensual, who's to know... \nDetails for the bonus post-epilogue comic!\n Here's more info on the previously mentioned stretch goals, plus some more!\nAll the stretch goals for the campaign!\nThe Extra Scenes goal is straightforward- I had to edit stuff out of the story to cut costs, and this will let me add them back in! The Enamel Pin will be a soft enamel pin based on the book, and added to all Signed Bookplate, Screenprint, and Original Ink tiers for free. In addition, a different hard enamel pin will be available in the new Enamel Pin Edition tier. What's Next is a short excerpt added to the back of the book that teases the next installment in the series (remember how other novels would hint at a sequel?). BULLISH is a part of a trilogy I've been developing, all loosely linked by the themes of supernatural horror, queer romance, and messy relationships. I hope to reveal more about the other two stories in the triad soon- though I'm sure I've left vague concepts and ideas all over my social media. Finally, at $30,000... Stickers. A screenprint style sticker will be added to all physical reward tiers, in a similar theme to the screenprint design!\nPage excerpt from BULLISH.\nLet's take a closer look at these extra rewards now... check out these sweet, sweet enamel pin designs. I personally am a sucker for pins, and 2 of my previous campaigns have been to fund enamel pin sets!\nThe Minotaur's Lament pin from the Enamel Pin Edition tier.\nThe Minotaur's Lament:\nis available with the physical book in its own tier, the Enamel Pin Edition ($25)\nwill be available as an add-on thru PledgeManager after the campaign ($5)\nany excess will be sold online at full price after all KS orders are shipped\nThe Shattered Heart pin, exclusive to the $30/100/200 tiers.\nThe Shattered Heart:\nis the 19k stretch goal pin, and is added to the Bookplate, Screenprint, and Ink Original tiers for free\nwill NOT be available as an add-on thru PledgeManager (only 200 being made)\nIn addition to the pins, there is an exclusive, limited edition screenprint being made for this campaign along with very limited slots for an original ink piece by yours truly! Both will be inspired by the themes and visuals from BULLISH (plus some backer input in the case of the originals). You can see the rough design for the screenprint and an example of my previous printmaking work below.\nRough design for the screenprint- black, white, and glittering terracotta red on a toned paper.\nExamples of my previous screenprint work.\nFinally, let's discuss the process art book, a look at the tier levels available, and my estimated timeline for this project.\nThe BULLISH Process Art Book will be delivered in two ways- over the duration of the book's production, and then as an assembled PDF for download. As mentioned earlier, bi-monthly updates after the campaign concludes will keep everyone in the loop on my progress. These updates will include how-to's, general advice, and detailed process documentation as I proceed through each step! I think this will be a very exciting way to share what my job entails to those unfamiliar, while also providing a map for comic artists who might need help getting started. My reward will hopefully be getting to read and support more comic artists in the future! \nSHIPPING REMINDER: if you back this campaign, again, remember that shipping will be charged at a later date! I'll be using PledgeManager to gather surveys and shipping costs next year, so I don't have to charge you more than what's needed. The prices listed below do not include shipping, which will vary depending on your location. Backers should expect around $5 for USA, $10 for Canada, and $12+ for anywhere else international, but trust that I will do my best to keep shipping costs down!\nThe rewards available for this campaign!\nMy current timeline for production of BULLISH is loosely as follows:\n---> 2020\n AUGUST - Campaign ends, introductory process post of current content, etc.\n SEPTEMBER - Further research, scripting and rough drafts.\n OCTOBER - Thumbnails, misc. cast and costume creation.\n NOVEMBER - Thumbnails end, font creation, type design.\n DECEMBER - Break month! Enjoy your holidays.\n---> 2021\n JANUARY to FEBRUARY - Pencils, pencils, pencils.\n MARCH - Pencils wind down, brush creation for inks/texture.\n APRIL - INK HELL BEGINS.\n MAY to JUNE - So much inking. \n JULY - Final print PDFs created, book orders sent in.\n NOVEMBER - Books arrive, shipping begins!\nAs is the nature of comics, things can change radically- you will always get 2 updates a month about the project (except December), and any sudden upsets or changes will be communicated!\nWait, just who is this gu- what on earth was that? A goblin?\nHowdy, I'm Cameron, the author and artist for this project! I'm also well known by my internet handle 'mancameron.' I'm a bisexual comic artist and illustrator currently based in the PNW. Hot pink is my favorite color, and I really, really like dogs. My work frequently varies in style and tone, but common themes range from the paranormal, autobiographical self reflection, ghostly horror, and queer love. I am very familiar with finishing large works of this scale and content. I've self-published Twenty Two & Alone, a 140 page collection of comics, poetry, and illustration in March of 2018, and I currently serialize my adult queer fantasy webcomic BAD MAGIK on Slipshine. You can find more work and examples on my portfolio site! \nThe logo! Ain't it cute lookin'.\nThis book will also be published under my weird little micro-press, Dum Sucker Press. I've published a few zines under it, but this will be its first graphic novel! If this campaign does well, I hope to do other stories of queer romance and drama under this press in a similar format in the future. Thank you for giving this project a look, and I hope to see you in post-campaign updates!\nPage excerpt from BULLISH.\n Before I forget, some thank you's to a few very important people!\nMy parents, for always being supportive of their hedonist son\n Hye M. for the help and advice in all things printing and kickstarters \nThe Bi Legends group for their constant light, joy, and work energy\nAll my friends who encourage me and my work every day- love youuu\nThe book font, miscellaneous type treatments, and design elements featured in the above promotional images were designed and executed by myself.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI am an experienced online shop owner and have shipped product across the US and abroad.

I've had a ton of fun making more comics since then and this December is the comic's 3rd anniversary!\nThe comic is series of journal comics, so you can expect the usual slice of life comics in here. There's also some funny moments from my DnD sessions with friends and even some comics about video games. There's a little bit of something for a variety of tastes! There is of course, a whole lot of comics with my cats. (What can I say? I love the little quirky goofballs.) You'll also find the rest of my family in some comics, and even my friends starring along side me on occassion.\nThe main reward is, of course, the book!

So keep an eye out for updates!\nI've never run a sucessful Kickstarter before, but I've been researching through Kickstarters I'd backed and through people documenting their process; as well as asking questions of my friend Bryan Ballinger - who sucessfuly funded his Animal Gas campaign.  Aside from asking questions, I am the only one running this Kickstarter. I've taken that into account and made sure I'm not adding too many rewards that would slow me down in regards to delivering things on time. However, we all know the postal system can be difficult at times, and as long as all the rewards get to me I will always update backers should anything get in the way of delivering this at my promised time.  As this is my first Kickstarter, I'm very open to learning how to make things better, especially for my backers. I can be reached in the comments and through messaging on Kickstarter, so I can make sure this process goes as smoothly as possible.\nThis image breaks down where the money is going for our initial goal of $1,900. Most of it, of course, is going towards getting the book printed. I have also set some aside to ship your orders to you and to make sure we have the kickstarter fees covered. There's some leftover as a buffer to make sure that we have enough to get everything printed and shipped out as safely as possible!\nThanks so much for taking a look at this Kickstarter. If you can't pledge any money to the campaign at this time, you can always share this with your friends and family. Maybe even ask someone to back it as a present for you? Any support is always helpful, and I appreciate you taking a look!\nKickstarter is a crowdfunding platform that brings people together in order to create things.
