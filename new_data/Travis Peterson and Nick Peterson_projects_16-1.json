[{"backer": "Travis Peterson and Nick Peterson", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Space Face Poster\nSpace Face: Mind of a Madman\nHello, my name is Han and I am directing Space Face, a feature-length documentary that explores existential questions through the life and career of my father, comic book artist Michael Allred. The film will feature interviews from some of the industry's greatest, including Kevin Smith, Brian Michael Bendis, Matt Fraction, Craig Thompson, Jo\u00eblle Jones, and many more.  \nMike Allred has continuously honed his craft while living out his childhood dream of creating comics. He is best known for his original works: Madman, Red Rocket 7, The Atomics, X-Ray Robot, his co-creations: iZombie plus the live-action CW adaptation streaming on Netflix, X-Statix, the brand new graphic biography, Bowie: Stardust, Rayguns, & Moonage Daydreams, and other projects: Silver Surfer, and Batman 66.  As bright as his life may appear, he has periodically endured extreme episodes of existential anxiety and psychological suffering. The first episode occurred at the age of 5. He has continued to experience them, with varying intensity, roughly every five years since then.\nMike Allred's Red Rocket 7\nThe episodes are reminiscent of an out-of-body psychedelic trip, brought on solely by existential questions of infinity, space, and meaning. These episodes have deeply impacted his psyche and, consequently, the work he has put out into the world\u2014most notably his creation Madman. \nMike Allred's Madman\nI have discussed these episodes and the questions that trigger them at length with my dad. I've also collected responses from dozens of interviews with fellow artists, writers, editors, musicians, directors and more. The responses have been thought-provoking.\nI am making this documentary both out of love for my dad and a desire to dig further into the questions that, at times, have driven him to become... a literal Madman. \nBehind the scenes with Mike Allred.\nPlan of Action\nI started research for the film nearly a year ago, acquired the necessary equipment and filmed my first interview last May. Since then, I have shot dozens of interviews with Mike's colleagues, collaborators and friends, mostly in the Portland and Eugene area. I am currently working on the rough edit and composing music for the film.\nMy intention for this campaign is to raise the necessary funds to travel outside the Pacific Northwest to shoot the remaining interviews and hire an attorney. If enough extra cash is raised above the initial goal, I would love to pay for color correction and professional sound to ensure the film looks and sounds as phenomenal as possible.\nI intend to complete all of the interviews by the end of the summer 2020 and the final cut of the film by the end of 2021. I will update supporters on a regular basis throughout the process. \nWho's Involved?\nI have help from people with years of industry experience to guide me as well as the resources at NW Film Center.\nI've already conducted interviews with some amazing talent (listed below) and there are many more interviews on the horizon.\nMike Allred, the subject of the film, is an Eisner- and Harvey-Award-winning comic book artist and writer, best known for his creator-owned series Madman, The Atomics, and Red Rocket 7, as well as his work on iZOMBIE, Silver Surfer, X-Force / X-Statix, Bug!, FF, Batman '66, Fables, Spider-Man, Sandman, and the recently-released graphic biography Bowie: Stardust, Rayguns, & Moonage Daydreams.\nLaura Allred is an Eisner-Award-winning comic book colorist best known for her work with her husband on titles like Madman, as well as her work with Jo\u00eblle Jones on Catwoman. \nGabriel Ba is a Eisner-Award-winning comic book artist best known for co-creating The Umbrella Academy, plus its live-action adaptation streaming on Netflix, Casanova, and Daytripper.\nInterview with Brian Michael Bendis.\nBrian Michael Bendis is an Eisner-Award-winning comic book artist and writer, best known as a co-creator of Miles Morales and Jessica Jones, as well as his work on Ultimate Spider-Man, Powers, New Avengers, Daredevil, Action Comics, and Superman.\nRandy Bowen is an acclaimed sculptor of pop-culture characters, best known for his work with Dark Horse, Marvel, and DC Comics.\nMatt Brundage is a comic book artist best known for his work on Art Ops.

The darker the shadow becomes, the world gets until the Destroyer of all Things finally emerges from the Void to swallow the world and everything in it. Are these the end times as foretold?\nPerhaps. Perhaps not.\nAcross the lands of R\u00fbl, great patrons have come forth to answer the threat posed by the Eternal Shadow by throwing back the darkness and sealing the rifts to the Demon Lord\u2019s realm. The Great Druid rouses the forests fight against demon and cultist alike, while the Queen of Faeries rallies the last of her children to make a final stand loosed by the growing unrest. These and others join forces to find the light they need to safeguard Urth for the rest of time.\nAgainst the Shadow is a cooperative board game designed by Adam Doochin and Dan Heinrich, where the patrons of R\u00fbl must come together to fight against the Demon Lord before this dreadful entity breaks through the cracks in reality and destroys the world. The patrons recruit heroes to undertake quests in the hopes of gaining treasures crucial for driving back the darkness. The Demon Lord, however, has many agents at its beck and call and sends cultists and demons to thwart these heroes\u2019 efforts. It\u2019s a race against time and the patrons must work together if Urth can be saved. Based on the popular horror-fantasy roleplaying game, Shadow of the Demon Lord, the board game gives you an all-new way to fight against the apocalypse. \nAgainst the Shadow is a cooperative race game for two to five players, with optional rules for one player or six. A typical game takes about an hour to play.\nWe need your help to make this game a reality. Even though the game has been designed and thoroughly tested, We still need to edit the rulebook and cards, finalize the layout, acquire a few more art assets, and, of course, pay for the printing and assembly. Given the expenses involved in these steps, We're asking for your help to bring this game to tables all over the world.\nThe best way to help is to choose a pledge level and back the campaign. The level you choose determines the rewards you get in return for your support. Provided the project funds, your dollars go toward covering the expenses incurred as we finishing this game. Now, if the unthinkable happens and the project doesn\u2019t fund, you pay nothing and the project doesn\u2019t happen. I do understand that not everyone can help, but if you believe in this project, I\u2019d appreciate it if you could help spread the word.   \nWant to see how the game works? Sure you do! Grab a prototype rule book here. Note, this is not the final rule book.\n(prototype)\nIn Against the Shadow, you become one of the mighty patrons of R\u00fbl, an individual who ranks among the most powerful in the land. You might become the High Jarl of the Jotun or the Faerie Queen. Each patron has special abilities that give you advantages in play.  \n(prototype)\nTo fight the Demon Lord, you need heroes. You recruit heroes from the land, finding dwarfs and clockworks, humans and goblins, and many other characters drawn from the pages of Shadow of the Demon Lord. Heroes, though, are meant to serve and fighting the Shadow means few will survive!\n(prototype)\nAs a patron, you issue commands that direct your heroes and change the circumstances in your favor, either to give you a much-needed edge against the Demon Lord or to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat! \n(prototype)\nAdventure awaits the heroes under your control. You send them into deadly situations to wrest treasures from terrifying locations and to find the light the world so desperately needs. Beware, though, for the Demon Lord has many tricks to thwart your efforts!\n(prototype)\nWhen your heroes complete quests, slay enemies, and explore the land, they find potent treasures to help you throw back the encroaching darkness.  \n(prototype)\nThe Demon Lord, however, will not give up without a fight. As you play the game, the Dark Lord of the Void places curses on the world, making the game harder to defeat. \n(prototype)\nAgainst the Shadow introduces a number of powerful patrons, each one the great movers and shakers in the lands of R\u00fbl. Patrons of the Demon Lord reveals their stories, histories, motivations, and servants. Packed with new lore, this 32-page PDF supplement is the perfect expansion for creating epic adventure for the Shadow of the Demon Lord roleplaying game.\nStay tuned for details!\nWe will be charging shipping after the Kickstarter concludes based on the table below. We will collect this via our pledge manager after the campaign ends. This is so we can be fair to all backer because shipping rates vary widely.  \nWill ship your rewards at our cost to Black Box hubs. Depending on where in the world you are, we will either ship to you from their hub in the UK, Canada, Australia, or the US.\nUSA: $11 to most states. $30 to Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico and US Virgin Islands \nCanada: $15\nAustralia: $14\nUK: $10\nMexico: $32 (from US)\nEurope (zone 1): $29 (from UK) Belgium, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Monaco, and the Netherlands\nEurope (zone 2): $29 (from UK) Austria, Denmark, Finland, Greece, Iceland, Malta, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland\nCentral & South America: $40 (from US) Most Countries\nCaribbean, Asia, & Middle East: $40 (from UK) Most Countries\nRest of the World*: $45 (from various hubs)\nUnfortunately, different laws and customs from some specific countries have made it impossible for Black Box to ship games to them. If you live in one of the countries below and back the project, let us know and we will research the shipping rate for you from the US and if possible make it happen. \n*BLACK BOX DOES NOT SHIP TO: Afghanistan, Brazil, Congo, Cote d'Ivoire, Cuba, Democratic Republic of Congo, Eritrea, Guam, Guinea-Bissau, Haiti, Iran, Iraq, Liberia, Libya, Myanmar (Burma), North Korea, Russia, Somalia, South Africa, Sudan, Syria, and the Ukraine.\n\nLegal\nWe would like to thank the great people at www.Game-icons.net for all the awesome icons we used during play-testing and mock-up creation.

That\u2019s why we created The Undress so you can CHANGE out of what you\u2019re wearing AND get into a new outfit - and it only takes about 30 seconds.\nSecurity, peace of mind, and convenience in a unique fashionable solution.\n      Remove Your Top: First, bring The Undress to your waist. Then use the soft handle to guide the front of the dress underneath anything you want to remove. Bring the straps over your head, and cinch both the neck and back cord locks to secure. Finally, simply remove your top and bra.\nRemove Your Bottoms: Insert your hands into the side access openings to easily remove your bottoms. Done!\n      Put your bra and top over The Undress, and use the special side openings to put on your bottoms.\nNext, simply loosen the cord locks and use the soft handle to guide the straps under all your top layers. Then just slip out of The Undress, and you\u2019ll be in your new outfit!\n  The Undress changes to fit YOU.

Love it, or send it back for a money-back guarantee! No questions asked!\nDo you guarantee it will fit? Yes! If it doesn\u2019t fit, you can exchange for a different size, or get your money-back. No questions asked!\nWhy isn\u2019t the bra strap included in the price? After we surveyed our customers, it was 50/50 in favor of a strap. So we did not want to force someone to buy the strap if they did not feel the need to have it. Also, it is quite laborious to make, so it does cost quite a bit to produce, and we make very little, if anything, on this item.\nHow did you decide on the length, and why isn\u2019t there a long version? This was debated and we made prototypes of both this current length and a longer version. We had test fitters try both, and the shorter length was the favorite BY FAR. The longer dress was quite cumbersome in comparison. But hey, if you really want a long version, email us and maybe we can be swayed!\nWhen does it ship?  Our target dates for Kickstarter Orders are September-October 2017. These are estimates and are subject to change.\nAre the prints really limited to Kickstarter? These prints are chosen specifically for Kickstarter and we plan to sell them out during this campaign. So, if you want any of the prints, you should back them early during the campaign.\nWhat is the fabric content? Information is being updated and all final fabric content will be posted in the Backer Survey. At that time you will be able to review all available fabric options before completing your survey and finalizing your order.\nWhat is the washing/drying instructions? Information is being updated and all final care instructions will be posted inside the Backer Survey. At that time you will be able to review all available fabric options before completing your survey and finalizing your order.\nWhat if I fall between sizes? If you fall between L and XL, we recommend picking Size C and use the Everfit System to adjust The Undress to your desired fit.\nInternational Orders / Shipping - Duties, Tariffs, Taxes are not included in price, and are the backers responsibility.\nLimited Fabrics -  Some of the PRINT fabrics are limited based on availability from our suppliers.  We will do the best we can to provide all prints options to everyone, but this may not be possible.  We will try to allow backers from earlier reward levels to select first (backers who ordered $194 or more dresses will also get choice priority.)\nThis is NOT a perfect system, although we believe it should work well. :)\nHopefully, our fabric suppliers have everything we need and this will not be an issue.\nAlso, we may continue our campaign into Indiegogo (at an increased price of course), and will reserve the option to have prints available there if they have not sold out in Kickstarter first.  Kickstarter backers get choice priority over Indiegogo backers.  Indiegogo backers may not have the full selection available.\nIt is vitally important that you fill our your order surveys as soon as you receive them, to help us navigate a potentially difficult ordering process.  We will send order surveys in \"waves\" starting around July 7-15 (but this is an ESTIMATE.  We will keep in touch via updates).\n     ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nHi! We LOVE Kickstarter and have already had 3 very successful campaigns, The Undress Version 1, The Undress Version 2 SPORT, and The Undercover in which we delivered over 13,000+ units in all three campaigns in 2015 and 2016 and 2017!\n\nOur factory production is already scheduled, and our fabric, trim, hardware are already sourced. We're confident we will be on time for delivery on this project, and the product will be of highest quality! Pledge with confidence!\n\nFABRIC LIMITED - We purposely have chosen fabrics that will be limited in production. If we happen to sell a \"bazillion\" dresses, we may add more designs and colors to balance the needs of the high volume of orders. Fabric supply is ALWAYS a commodity, and we will do our best to provide all choices to all backers (but know availability is highly dependent on suppliers)\n\nWe're veterans at this point, and we are very confident in our ability to fulfill on all pledges since we have be successful three times before!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Hello!", "descp": "Thank you for supporting our project!

My name is Thobias Hoffm\u00e9n and I\u2019m a Swedish writer and director. I would like to tell you a little bit about a passion project, We R Animals*.\nThat's me!\nAnimals*\n*creatures, pets, bestial, carnal, erotic, fleshly, lustful, beasts, lunatics, maniacs, psychopaths, savages, brutes.\nWe R Animals is a film project that I have, on and off, lived with for about eight years now. It all started with the idea of doing short films in the same style as Tom & Jerry or Itchy & Scratchy, but it developed over time and eventually ended up being a complete world with a lot of cool characters and stories. Based on all these ideas I wrote a first draft for a full length feature, which attracted a lot of interest. So in 2010 I ended up selling it to a big production company. However since I kept on wanting to do this as an r-rated film with animatronic puppets it was really hard to convince regular film financiers to invest in the project.\nI moved on to work on other projects, but in 2015 I got the rights back and I then took my own money and shot the pitch you can see at the top of this page, and thanks to that one I managed to get a small amount of money to create the conceptual teaser-trailer (which you can see above) and teamed up with Academy Award nominated producer Mathias Fjellstr\u00f6m.\nAnd all this leads to this campaign. With it, we're hoping to speed things up.\nStill from the teaser\nALL RIGHT! TELL US MORE. WHAT\u2019S THE MOVIE ABOUT? \nEver since we crawled up from the sea, and down from the trees, the gap between man and animal have become bigger and bigger. While humans have gone to the moon and invented smart phones animals are just hopelessly underdeveloped.\nOr, is that really the case? We R Animals tells the story of a different reality. They\u2019re not as stupid as they might seem and they\u2019re definitely not as cute and innocent as they appear to be. Being cute is actually something they\u2019ve learned to benefit from since a lot of the \u201dcute-animal-video-clips\u201d you see on the web are in fact produced by the animals themselves. Much like the porn industry, this is a nasty business where shady animals earn a lot of money on ads and treats their stars like shit. Welcome to the nasty \u201dcute animals film industry\u201d!\nFlash, a seemingly harmless, sphynx cat is one of these cute animal film producers and he has just found his new star, a bunny named Leah. Leah lives an unhappy life at a circus where she\u2019s never experienced any kind of love. Flash decides to kidnap her but nothing goes according to plan and this creates a chain of reactions filled with revenge, murder and mystery.\nLeah ends up in the middle of a conflict between Flash and his partners and a gang of vampire bats on a hunt for an emerald that they think possess magical powers.\nWe R Animals is a movie that mixes humor with action, crime with fantasy and the movies we grew up loving with the movies of today.\nStill from the teaser\nOK! SOUNDS INTERESTING. BUT PUPPETS? LIKE THE MUPPETS? \nNo, this is not the Muppets. We\u2019ll use puppets, but in another way. Have a look at the teaser and you\u2019ll get an idea of how it will look.\nYou can also take a look at the behind the scenes film below, and see how they are created. The puppets will get made by my dear friend Niklas Hermansson and his crew at Fixas.\n  COOL! SO NO CGI AT ALL?\nWell, yeah, we will be using CGI as well. I think that a clever mix is the best way to go and it also will give an unique look and feel to the movie. We\u2019ll use practical effects as much as possible and when it\u2019s necessary, we\u2019ll do touch ups with CGI. But no, I don\u2019t wanna make the characters as CGI-creatures. They\u2019re gonna be puppets.\nThe end result is what matters, and if that involves some CGI so be it. I\u2019m looking for a unique tone here and I think a mixture of old and new techniques are the way to go.\nLike this for example, how we created the throne-room in the teaser. \nWe built a foreground-miniature, and then a life-size throne for the puppet. After that we filmed a puppet in front of a green screen and put him in, and made a set extension. Tadaaa, great mix. A good example of a great collaboration between the guys at Fixas and the excellent vfx-people at Goodbye Kansas.\nFor the cyborg-dog, we made a miniature cyborg and built a miniature set for those shots. For the shots with the dog we built a life-size set and then used a hand puppet. \nGood mix!\nSO WHY KICKSTARTER? \nIn 2010 a bunch of stills from a test shoot was spread across the web, they went viral and attracted some interest to the project. However back then I didn't even have a script that I was satisfied with yet, and it was also before crowdfunding was a thing, so there were no real way to use that interest for financing the project. \nAfter that We R Animals has been lying in the background while I have done lots of other stuff. I wanted more experience in directing, and I wanted to find the right techniques to make the film as good as I know it can get, but also as cheap as possible. \nSo in recent years I have worked with a lot of different things. Web-series, TV-series and features. A lot of it praised and award-winning here in Sweden. \nI'm ready for We R Animals now. I have over the years gotten me a fine network of people who\u2019ll now be involved in this film. People you can read more about later in this text under \u201dcrew\u201d. \nSo yeah, we want to KICKSTART this movie, with the help of kickstarter and you guys. Basically to speed things up and to be able to work on it not only in our spare time.\nGOALS \nOk, so I have a real grand vision for this project, but making this film into the glorious feature that I\u2019ve envisioned will most definitely cost a lot more than I\u2019ll be able to finance through a crowdfunding campaign. \nHowever, there\u2019s a lot of stories to be told with the characters in the \u201dWe R Animals\u201d-universe. So as a first goal for this campaign I\u2019m aiming to make shorter films. I'd rather make good short films instead of trying to make a longer film with a lot of compromises.\nBut, of course, I still have the ultimate goal set on making this into a feature.  It might be a long journey, but please join me on this quest and I'll make sure it\u2019ll be worth it!\nBasically, the more money we can get, the closer to the feature we\u2019ll get. Every dollar (!), everything raised in this campaign will be used in my quest for making the feature. Either through shorts that will convince people to invest in the feature, or by making the feature right away! That\u2019s the best way to do it.\nREWARDS\n!!!Keep in mind!!! All pledges are based on Swedish currency! The amounts in dollars below are estimates. When you choose your pledge on the right you will always see the current value. The exchange is about 1 USD = appr. 8.50 - 9 Swedish crowns.  !!!\nIn the list below you can see a summary of all the rewards. As a lover of collectibles and stuff myself, I\u2019ve made sure to offer things that I would love to own as well. \nAlmost all of the rewards below will be produced exclusively for this campaign! So get on board now!\nUPDATE REGARDING DVD/BLU-RAY\nYou can now get the film on regular DVD or Blu-ray.\nSo if you already have chosen the digital download, but rather want it on DVD/Blu-ray, you can now manage your pledge and upgrade!\nBut what does this mean for the Super-exclusive-kickstarter-limited-DVD/bluray?? Well, it's still as limited and exclusive as before. Only 250 of them will get made. But we will now also throw in the poster in that pledge! And have a different cover as well. And yeah, it will be signed and numbered, which the regular one won't be.\n\nUPDATE REGARDING \"PUTTING YOUR NAME IN THE CREDITS\"\nYou can now put your name in the credits for approx $50 USD (440 SEK)! All the pledges above this tier will also have their name in the credits!\nNEW REWARDS!\nA thank you card! Signed by me. And yes, all of you who've already chosen a pledge above the 215 SEK-tier will get this one as well.\nAnd we also have this wonderful option. \nADD-ONS!\nBuild your own package of rewards with add-ons!\nYou can add a reward to your pledge level by simply choosing an amount to add and answer a survey at the end of the campaign to let us know what item you want.\nADD-ONS INSTRUCTIONS: To add an add-on to your pledge, follow those steps:\n1) Press the \u201cManage Your Pledge\u201d button above. If you have not pledged yet, it will say \u201cBack this Project\u201d.\n2) Increase your pledge in the \u201cPledge Amount\u201d box by the total of the add-on you want to add.\n3) After the end of the Kickstarter campaign you will receive a survey that will ask you questions so that you can explain how you would like the add-on money assigned.\nCREW\nWriter & director: Thobias Hoffm\u00e9n\nThe man behind We R Animals is Thobias Hoffm\u00e9n who\u2019s also written the script and will direct the film.

But here\u2019s what we do to minimize those:\n\nFirst of all we are professional film makers and have no illusion of the effort needed to make this happen. The film will be executive produced by David Sandberg, the man behind the world wide crowdfunding hit sensation \u201cKung Fury\u201d. David will both work with the project creatively, but will also share his experiences on how to handle a crowdfunded project. \n\nThe budget is quite dynamic. We\u2019re aiming for making the film with advanced animatronic puppets and high quality equipment as well as well crafted set design, but the film can of course also be made cheaper by using less advanced equipment, shot a lot of stuff on location and, most important, using less advanced puppets. This might give some limitations to the style and tone of the film, but it won\u2019t change the characters and the story and those are the most important things, This also means that the more money we get the cooler looking movie we\u2019ll get. \n\nThe biggest risk in the project is that it might be hard to make a proper time plan at this point. However this is what we\u2019re aiming for: \n\nIf the first goal is reached: The short film will be finished in 2018. \n\nIf the first stretch goal is reached: The prequel will premiere in 2018. \n\nIf the second stretch goal is reached (The full feature): This is the hardest one to predict, but we\u2019re aiming for a premiere in late 2018. \n\nOur plan is also of course to be as transparent on how everything is coming along. This will be communicated via the behind-the-scenes-film that is a part of the rewards and via updates on social media outputs.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Thobias Hoffmen\nFirst created \u00b7 9 backed\nA cat person with four dogs.

Pixelmash now includes support for reference layers, saving and loading layer effects, color profiles, tiled painting, and more. There\u2019s also a powerful new gradient layer effect, and even support for saving and loading files as reusable templates. Check the videos below for more!\n\nPixelmash 2020 trailer: youtu.be/mi2hsA5wzMc\n\n\nIf you need to upgrade your license (or want to check if you need to), you can do so at . If you purchased Pixelmash from nevercenter.com in the last year, your upgrade to the new version is free; simply download the new version from and use your same registration information. Pixelmash 2020 is also available on and via the .\n\n:\n\nWe've also created a brand new website with tons of feature videos both new and old, check them out and read more at ! Here is a quick overview of some new things in this Pixelmash 2020 update:\n\n\nThis is a major new feature which lets you easily re-use your work across projects, similar to Brushes in tools like Photoshop. If you've set up a complex (or simple) set of Layer Effects to achieve a certain style, you can now export that as its own file and easily import it into future projects. Just use [File > Export Layer Effects...] to export the effects on the current layer. If you want to export the entire layer structure with effects, use [File > Save as Template]\n\n\nPixelmash already had one gradient type, Auto Gradient. The new effect is just called Gradient, and it's a simple tool which allows you to choose the angle, colors, and number of steps, and is applied to everything in that layer.\n\n\nYou can now mark any layer as a reference layer. It will display with adjustable opacity, and will not be affected by layer effects or affect anything else in the scene. This is perfect for importing reference images, temporarily marking a previous animation layer as reference, and more.\n\n\nColor profiles can be an annoying headache when working with images. We've added simple tools for keeping your color profiles straight [Edit > Color Management]. By default, you're all set just leaving this as it is, but if you need more control you can switch to Adobe RGB, no color management, convert on export, and more.\n\n\nYou can now toggle whether a parent's layer effects will affect the children or not. Both are very useful for different circumstances.\n\n\nIf you are viewing your work in tiled view, you can now work anywhere in the space, not just the original image bounds.\n\n\nThe previous version of Pixelmash was 1.2.5, and the new version is 2020.0. Further versions will reflect the new scheme. This change emphasizes the live nature of Pixelmash's development, as we focus on faster, smaller, more frequent updates in response to the community's needs. We've also updated the licensing system, so that instead of us releasing a new paid upgrade each year, each license simply comes with a year of free upgrades. This is not a subscription; your latest valid version will always continue to work even if you haven't purchased future upgrades. It simply ensures that everyone gets a full year of upgrades regardless of when they purchase.\n\nHope you like it!

Skateboarding started out in California in the 50s, came into its own in the 70s, and now in the present, NUFF is taking it to the next level.\n  Our Boards\nAt the heart of what NUFF does is craft solid, dependable skateboards designed to do what skateboards do: help you get around town. NUFF boards are incredibly powerful with a 2000W motor, surprisingly affordable, and extremely fun to ride!\n                We\u2019ve pioneered some of the latest technology in super-light, high-powered electric motors in order to make our boards top-of-the line, while also remaining more affordable than our competition. \n*Update as of March 2nd! New Wheel Options!*\nThe team here at NUFF has endlessly been working to constantly have new and exciting upgrades to the boards. With this being said, we are proud to announce the brand new wheel options that all backers will have when they support our campaign! Check out a few samples below! \n       You now will have the option to choose what color board you would like to receive, which will dictate that wheel color as well! \nOur First Unboxing! \nTo really give you an idea of what you will be receiving when you back this campaign, we sent a brand new board to one of our consumers in the market and had him unbox it! Hear what Shahrukh had to say about what you will be getting in the box!\n    Beginner or Expert? We Have Modes That Are Perfect for You\nOur NUFF boards are beginner friendly as well as tuned perfectly for those who are experts and seeking that extra thrill. \nBeginner Mode : This is a mode for first time users and those who want to get a feel for how our boards ride! Cruise at a top speed of 15mph\nSuperior Mode : Finished with Beginner mode or are you an expert at riding skateboards? This mode is perfect for you! Our superior mode will give you higher acceleration while hitting a top speed of 24mph!\n  How You Control Your Adventure\n   Each one of our NUFF Boards comes paired with an intuitive and ergonomic controller. Easily control the speed of your board with the speed knob, as well as being able to keep an eye on the battery life of your board!\nThe Power Source \nOur NUFF Boards are equipped with a state of the art removable battery system. It is waterproof and dust-proof, so you can ride in almost any condition!  Each wheel is equipped with 1000 Watts of power as well, giving you that extra power you have never experienced before! Run out of juice from your adventure? No problem! Just detach the battery, give it a quick charge and you will be back on your adventure in no time!\nKnow Exactly What You Are Riding\n  Our Promise, NUFF Said\nWe firmly believe that being well-off should not be a prerequisite for owning a NUFF board. Skateboards were designed to be a fun, fast, and simple mode of transportation. That\u2019s why we have done everything possible to set our costs at a level that will not keep our boards out of the hands of people who love to skate. NUFF boards are not designed to be a Christmas present you use for fun and set it in the corner. These boards were designed to be a way to get from point A to point B\u2014only faster.\n    Gear Up!\nCustomize your NUFF board with our exclusive NUFF stickers!\nCannot escape the feeling of always being on our NUFF boards? We got you covered! With each NUFF board purchase, receive a mini fingerboard to cruise around on with your fingers!\nLastly, we want our NUFF riders to be comfortable while they ride. This being said, all boards will also include a ultralight and comfortable tee to cruise around in!\nShipping Details\nWe want you to have the NUFF board as soon as we can get it to you! Shipping will take place in early June, and as a token of our appreciation, shipping within the United States is completely free and on us! However, for those supporters outside of the States, a $75 dollar shipping fee will be added.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nHave Fun Riding, While Being Safe\n\nOur NUFF Boards are fun to be on, but it is also an electric skateboard. For first time users, it will be different riding feeling, so it is advised that you try the board in the \"low mode\" and in an open area before tackling the higher speed and more crowded areas. Nuff also believes in safety when riding our boards, so always wear a helmet and any personal protective gear in case anything happens. Do not ride the board out of your skills and care about your environment.\n\nLegality\n\nLaws and regulations regarding electric vehicles and electric skateboards vary by country, state, county, and municipality, so before hopping onto one our NUFF boards, be sure to check out your local laws about electric skateboards!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "David R Checker\n2 created \u00b7 0 backed\nWith passion for skating, we set on a mission to build a more powerful and affordable skateboard.

Have you ever considered growing a lemon tree indoors? Maybe strawberries on the wall? A pineapple? I know what you\u2019re thinking, there is NO WAY I can grow a pineapple in my house! Actually, it is quite easy with the support of the Aspect.\nThe Aspect is the first LED grow light developed specifically for interior design, allowing you to grow whatever plant you want wherever you want while aesthetically enhancing any space.\nENERGY EFFICIENT \u2013 Save hundreds on electricity and maintenance over other technologies.\nCUSTOMIZE - With over 17 different cord choices and the addition of a lampshade, your plants will be growing in style.\nFULL GROW SPECTRUM \u2013 Maximize plant growth and improve plant quality with our full spectrum LED light that is efficiently absorbed by plants.\nBUILT TO LAST - Never replace our bulb! We assemble the Aspect right here in Bethlehem, PA to insure the highest quality! With the help of our US based LED manufacturer, we can achieve a lifespan of over 90,000 hours!\nSMALL OR LARGE - Support most small plants with our 20 watt unit, or grow trees with our 40 watt units. We even offer a commercial high yield package of 160 watts.\nSUPPORT YOUR HEALTH - Houseplants extract up to 87% of pollutants from indoor air, including volatile organic compounds, formaldehyde, pesticides and more.\nWARRANTY - We pride ourselves on our dedication to each customer, because to us, customer satisfaction is everything. We offer a 3-year warranty, with a 90-day Money Back Guarantee!\nCHRISTMAS DELIVERY Great gift idea for anyone. We guarantee to deliver the EARLY BIRD special packages before Christmas.\nLimited light? Whether you are growing near a window in a dark corner of your room, the Aspect is here to help. With the right light, you can easily grow any plant inside. It is time to get creative with your d\u00e9cor!\n2 clicks is all it takes to share our campaign and make a huge difference\nDepending on what you want to grow, we have an Aspect for it! We outlined applications and coverage below to help you pick the right Aspect for your home.\nThe SMALL 20 watt Aspect is great for partial sun plants such as houseplants plants, herb, spices, succulents, flowers, and some bonsais. It is also great for those larger plants that just need an extra boost of light to thrive indoors.\nThe LARGE 40 watt Aspect can support larger plants that demand full sun, such as tomatoes, cannabis, peppers and more. It is great for citrus trees and fruiting plants that grow to a large size and need more intense light coverage.\nAn interchangeable lamp shade hook is included in your Aspect Kit which allows you to hang most lampshades to match the decor of any room (lamp shade not included).\nJust hook it, hang it, and plug it in! The Aspect is incredibly easy to set up. With 3 easy steps you will be on your way to enhancing your home with beautiful green plants.\n Don't want to hang the Aspect from the ceiling? Don't worry, there are numerous alternatives such as a Shepards hook\nPlants convert certain wavelengths of light into energy using photosynthesis. With the wrong light, plants will elongate or die. Too much blue light and your plants will never grow, too much red and they will never develop strong roots. By using LED technology, we are able to produce the exact wavelengths in the right balance of blue and red that supports beautiful, healthy plants.\nWe offer two spectrums for both residential and commercial growers.\nD\u00e9cor White (20w & 40w Aspect Kits)\nBrilliant white for D\u00e9cor Lighting\n3000K Color Temperature\nRepresents Colors Vibrantly (High CRI Value), no blue or red tint\nSupports Plant Growth\nHigh Yield Amber (Deluxe 420 Package & upon request)\nAmber Color\nDesigned for Large and Commercial Grows\n1700K Color Temperature\nSupports Plant Growth\nWe reached our goal of $9,500 so if our backers get us to the $20,000 mark we will make 10 additional cord colors available.

Our team is compiled of Penn State University and Temple University graduates with backgrounds in Environmental Science, Energy Engineering, and Political Science.    \nWe initially created Soltech Solutions 2 years ago to design and manufacture traditional, high powered, red and blue growlights. After some extensive research in groundbreaking LED technology and plant growth we realized there were no growlights that could efficiently grow your plants while simultaneously creating a welcoming indoor atmosphere. We set out to bring a solution to this problem and developed the first d\u00e9cor pendant style growlight.\nIn the early stages of development we ran through heaps of prototypes finally landing on a design that could work. The first model of the Aspect hit the market January of 2016 and we\u2019ve had nothing but positive feedback.\nBecause of our manufacturing space (the basement of a local business incubator) and the long manufacturing process, we knew we had to come up with a better design. We took all of your feedback into consideration and developed the new Aspect model. It\u2019s sleeker, more efficient, and includes custom options never before offered. With a colorful choice of cords and the addition of lampshades, your home d\u00e9cor will never look the same.\nOur mission is for everyone to be able to use our product, weather you have a green thumb or are a Grass-assassin! We want to make it easy for people to bring nature indoors and with the Aspect, you can.\nCheck us out on:\nhttp://www.thevalleyledger.com/?p=22075\nhttp://areatech51.com/aspect-first-grow-light-developed-interior-design-launches-kickstarter/\nhttp://kickingitforward.org", "risks": "", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 2 or more", "title": "Virtual High Five", "descp": "If the Aspect isn't right for you, you can still show your support by donating $2 to our campaign.

STICKY FINGERS will be similar to this in style, but will be a narrative film with actors, and textures similar to the poster. If you like this style of animation, you'll love this short film.\nJOKER GREETING CARD!!\nI'm the Co-Founder of Joker Greeting Cards and we made a special edition HALLOWEEN CARD for this campaign.\nWhen you give your friend/enemy this card and they press the PLAY button, the card will play this ANNOYING scream sound over and over again for 3+ hours straight... the screaming WILL NOT STOP until they destroy it.

Who is this man? Who is controlling him behind this mask? And what do they want with this woman?\nThat's as far as I wanna go into detail, but trust me everything will be revealed in the short!\nWHY WE NEED YOU!\nThis is a different kind of animated film.\nThe short has already been shot and edited and now we need your help to do the animation. -- This will be created by the classic technique of hand drawn rotoscope animation. Basically, the live action footage will now be re-drawn as animation.\nThis is NOT a fancy photoshop filter, It will be hand drawn by people not robots.\nDANNY ELFMAN!!\nWe have 2 posters and 4 CD Soundtracks Signed by Danny Elfman\nSIGNED Nightmare Revisited CD\nDanny Elfman Rewards - Signed SPIDERMAN - SLEEPY HOLLOW - BETTLEJUICE CD SOUNDTRACKS\nSIGNED 24'' tall and 16'' wide Poster from Danny Elfman's Music from the Films of Tim Burton Oct 30 - Nov 2 2014 shows at LA Live and Nokia Theater\nSIGNED Nightmare Revisited Poster by Danny Elfman.

This was the foundation for Boulder Denim. Knowing that there are many pants with many features we decided to design a pant that included the most useful of those features, making them the most functional and stylish jeans on the market.\nOur sizing guarantee to YOU:\nIn the year we spent developing Boulder Denim we realized a few important things about fit and sizing.\nFor women, we discovered that we could completely simplify the fitting process when we finally settled on the blend that makes up our patented ultra-stretch denim. After testing our woman\u2019s cut on women that are both slim and curvy, we were able to design a single cut that fits virtually all body types.\nBecause men don\u2019t typically wear skin tight clothing it was important to design a cut that sits naturally on a man\u2019s lower body, while not being overly tight. This discovery lead to the creation of our two fits, SLIM and ATHLETIC.\nWe are so confident with our sizing that if your jeans don\u2019t fit, all you do is send them back to us and we will send you another pair on us.\n*Customers outside of North America will be charged an additional $20 for international shipping.\n FOR MEN:\nTo determine your fit, there are two key measurements.\nFirst, measure the smallest part of your waist at your natural waistline. Second, measure your thigh 2 inches below your crotch Then cross reference, your waist and thigh measurement with the sizing chart to determine your fit. Men looking for a skinny fit can size down. The denim will stretch to your body.\nFOR WOMEN:\nYou only need to measure the smallest part of your waist at your natural waistline. Our jeans are so incredibly stretchy to ensure an absolutely skin tight fit we recommend sizing down.\nMade with the climber in mind and created to truly combine fashion and adventure for a slimmer fit you can wear anytime.\nMedium rise that sits just above the hip, slim through the thigh, knee and calf with a slight taper\nOffers a perfectly tailored fit that works for men with slim to medium legs.\nFits well for slim or medium builds as the taper increases proportionally with waist size.\nBEST FOR: Men with slim to medium legs that want a tailored look.\nFor the gym rat, crossfitter or bodybuilder. This fit is muscular-glute approved and designed for men that spend a lot time in the gym.\nMedium rise that sits just above the hip, more room through the thigh, knee and calf with a slight taper.\nOffers more thigh and calf room for men with muscular legs.\nBEST FOR: Men with big legs that have trouble finding pants that can accommodate their thighs. These are for the crossfitter, bodybuilder or football player that never skips leg day. They also look great on men with thicker legs or larger builds that are looking for a roomier fit.\nDesigned to combine our 360-degree stretch and a perfect cut that embraces the natural movement of a woman\u2019s body. The stretch is perfect for women of all shapes.\nMedium/Higher rise, that is meant to move with you as your body bends.\nThe ultra-stretch denim allows you to have a higher-waist that doesn\u2019t restrict movement or dig in when you bend over.\nBEST FOR: Women that are slim to very curvy. The denim is so unbelievably stretchy that it will hug even the most curvaceous women.\nSo rest assured and order with confidence that not only will these pants fit you perfectly and feel amazing, your butt will look phenomenal!\nThe Boulder Denim brand was inspired by necessity and created by adventurists. We know what it\u2019s like having to balance our thirst for thrill and everyday responsibilities. Which is why created our denim to cater to whatever it is your day has in store for you. Aside from selling comfortable pants, we wanted to be the true advocates for adventure and we\u2019ll do this by giving back to you, our amazing community. \n#1 | Every year a portion of our earnings will go towards our \u201cWhat\u2019s your adventure?\u201d campaign. You tell us what your idea of an epic getaway would be and the person with the best trip will be decided upon by the Boulder Denim community. The prize being the trip you dreamt and 2016\u2019s trip that will be accompanied by world record highliner, Spencer Seabrooke and the boulder denim team. \n#2 | The \u201cEveryday Athlete Sponsorship Program\u201d (EASP).

All the major parts are in place for the basic gameplay. Multiplayer, Brawlers, weapons, and multiple maps are ready to go. Over the next rounds of development we will be working on extending our custom game editors for more variety and awesomeness. Let's begin with some talk on the game and our plans.\nWe say retro multiplayer platform mayhem, and we mean every word of it. Mighty Brawlers is built on solid old school platforming with updated twists.\nWe have added tools to ensure the mayhem of brawling will be in tune with how a retro platformer would play. Intuitive strafing, and simple angular aiming took us a bit of time to refine, but they were worth the effort. Ultimately, moonwalking as the Mad Hatter while pwning with a Velociraptor gun is quite amusing. \nWe have added teleport stations to allow for jumping between and around maps. Teleporting is handled with a timer to free you from the need to press a trigger, or heaven forbid to stop firing to tap another button.  It can be an escape or means to jump to another part of the map.\nA few testers have described it as a retro Smash Brothers, meets Super Mario Bros., in a Halo death match. \nEach Brawler has been pixel-crafted with loving care. We have the ambitious goal of 200 unique Brawlers, each with a unique weapon. Then after launch, we want to continue with at least 1 new Brawler pack per week. \nThere are 75 Brawlers in the current roster. All unique, but a few favorites that might need licensing ;). We couldn't resist putting a few well-known characters in for pre-release testing. Of course they will need to be removed if we can't secure a license. \n59 of 200 Brawlers\nWhat is a Brawler Pack?\nA Brawler Pack is a group of usually 3 - 5 themed Brawlers with an accompanying weapon. This an example of the Military Brawler Pack. \nGeneral/.44; Soldier/MP5; Sniper/.50cal; Pilot/9mm; Battle Rattle/RPG\nSome packs will have more, while some will have fewer. There will be packs with 7 Brawlers, like Dante's Inferno Brawler Pack. While a pack with only 1 Brawler will be quite unique. (Just wait until you see Uncle Sam).\nOur world is ginormous! We are planning on 3 maps on our launch date. A map will be a section of the world dedicated to one type of style, like neighborhoods. There will be missions and NPC's specific to each map. We are planning to release a new map each month. \nIf you can image 2 sugar cubes (a Brawler) stacked inside something the size of 2 football fields, this is getting close to our total area. Mighty Brawlers' world will be constantly evolving and growing. Each map will bring its own challenges and benefits. \nWhere will the money go? Content, Expansion, Platforms & Servers.\nContent\nBoth our roster and world are huge. We will use the funding to dedicate more of our time and talents to fleshing out both of these. \nGenerally, a Brawler goes from idea to animation in around 2 hours. After they are running around, we have to create their weapons, and projectiles; then build both of them out for playability. \nNext, we have tile sets and our maps. The tile sets that are already or nearly completed are dirt, ghetto, warehouse, and pipe. We will then plan each enormous map, create NPC's & backgrounds. Then actually build it out. \nWe have thousands of hours of content creation ahead of us.\nExpansion\nOur game is already playable. We want it to launch with an amazing set of features. We need time and some support to extend our list. These are the most important items.\nCharacter Editor - Extend parameters to allow for flight/hover, and wall climbing.\nWeapon Editor - Extend to account for 2nd weapon.\nBullet Editor - Extend to account for flight patterns, attribute manipulation, spawning, waves, and multi-origin points.\nWorld Editor - Extend teleports, switches, and rewrite \"water/lava\".\nRedeem System - Create a system where users will be able to input codes to unlock packs and worlds. \n\nPlatforms\nWhen we reach our funding goal of $25k, we will be launching Mighty Brawlers on 2 gaming platforms.\niOS\nAndroid\nServers\nOur servers are running on Node.js, and tweaked for performance. These are ready to really turn some sweet multiplayer action for everyone. As the game grows and expands to have more and more players, we want to be prepared to scale quickly and effectively. Then be ready to handle the costs of supporting multiple servers running more than 1000 players per map. \nDouble Our Fun(ds)! - $50,000\nWe're participating in OUYA's #FreeTheGames Fund, created by OUYA to support developers making new and creative console games. OUYA will match your pledge dollar-for-dollar if we raise a minimum of $50,000, so help us get there and make a great game for everyone! To be eligible for this match, we commit that this game will be an OUYA exclusive for six months\u2014no matter what. To learn more about OUYA, go to www.ouya.tv\nWe are ready and prepared to release on Android and iOS if our funding goal of $25k is met! However, if we can reach the stretch goal of $50k we can release our game on Ouya first, and add more Brawlers, more maps, and more features!\nStretch Goal Additions:\nOuya Release!\n200 More Brawlers at launch\n3 More Maps\nNew Features: personal Brawler upgrades, revenge system, team system, power-ups, and BOSS LEVELS! (Join up to conquer the Kraken!)\n\nCheck them out. They are quite useful.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are challenges to overcome before launch of Mighty Brawlers. \n\n1. The exorbitant amount of Brawlers. We have 75 Brawlers ready, we want 125 more before launch. This just takes time. \n\n2. The vast world that is NOT auto-generated. We have to touch every single one of 864,000,000 tiles to fill our world. We don't plan on having all this done at launch, but we want to get a solid running start. Again, this just takes dedicated time to plan, build and test. \n\n3.

Steve Wang will take these drawings, and other references and make it into something cohesive and amazing. \nDevelopment Artwork of \"The Demon\" to be played by Doug Jones\nConcept Art\nTHE VISITANT \nGENRE: HORROR\nSYNOPSIS : A MOTHER PROTECTS HER CHILDREN FROM A DEMONIC INTRUDER   \nWHY KICKSTARTER?\nUnlike a feature film which has a market to make money once it's been made, there is no short film sales market. And because there is no financial gain for an investor, it's hard to get the money needed to make unique projects like this.\nKickstarter lets us give you unique rewards you cannot get anywhere else and in exchange you give us the artistic freedom to create new and uniquely awesome content just for you. \nAfter our first successful Kickstarter collaboration on the short film DRAINED, we have re-teamed again to create both a film and a video game. Influenced by classic horror films like THE SHINING, but updated for today\u2019s audiences who love films like INSIDIOUS and PARANORMAL ACTIVITY we want to give you an awesome experience.\nWhy a film and a game? We know your hard earned money is valuable, and you want a lot of stuff for it. So this time around we're going beyond the short and we're including a video game that expands the story told in the short film.\nWe agree that most video games based on films generally suck. They suck because there's no story, no cool characters and no ambiance to get pulled into . . . they're lame cause nobody cares while making them. Jon and I are avid gamers who love games like Bio-Shock (HOLY CRAP ISN'T 'INFINITE' AMAZING), Skyrim and Zelda... (games that tell a story) and we want to make something awesome. While the film tells the story of a mother who protects her children from a demon in her house the game tells the origin story of the demon and is a prequel to the short film.  As a gamer it will take you on a journey of moral choices and lead you to emotions that you may or may not want to visit.\nWhat if we get more money than we're asking for?  Every indie film and video game is written with a minimum budget in mind to make something great, but we all have awesome ideas in our back pocket that we'd love to do if we get more money.  \nIf we go beyond our goal, we can expand both projects and give you things that weren't possible before. Basically, the more money we get, the more cool visual stuff we can put onto the screen. \nTHE FILM\nFor the past 6 years each October Jon has hosted a weekly series of horror film screenings for a small group of friends... since then we've seen A LOT of horror films and we're really excited to make a film that movie lovers AND fans of the genre will love. We've put together an amazing roster of talent to make it happen.\nSTARRING - DOUG JONES  as THE DEMON. Doug is a true master of bringing character and personality to unique creatures. We\u2019re really excited to work with Doug to make a new original creature.\nDoug Jones as... All of these guys.\nSTARRING - AMY SMART as THE MOM. We're very excited to announce that Amy has joined us in the making of this film! She'll keep the fear and the high emotion of a mom scared to death to face the unknown, but does it to save her daughter. \nCREATURE DESIGNER - STEVE WANG We wanted to make sure Doug looks 100% legit as our demon, so we called up Steve. As a veteran special makeup effects artist and creature designer from films like Hellboy I&II, X-Men: Last Stand, The Predator, and Underworld. Steve has worked with fellow veterans before him including Stan Winston, Rick Baker and Dick Smith. Steve will make sure that Doug looks creepy, scary, and above all realistic.\nSteve Wang with The Predator\nCOMPOSER - CHRIS BACON has scored films like the Jake Gyllenhaal film SOURCE CODE and gave us the haunting score on DRAINED. Most recently he's been writing like crazy for the new Bates Motel series on A&E. \nChris Bacon, composer for the new Bates Motel series on A&E.\nTHE VIDEO GAME - Every story has to start somewhere. \nThe game tells the origin story of the demon as an RPG set in the world of the 1930's dust bowl. The story is about a father who makes a deal with a demon to accomplish a series of tasks to save his dying family. Here are some early beta released stills from the game so nothing is final. We're excited to take you from a poor dust bowl farm, into the bowels of the demon's lair and beyond.\nCharacter Description\nInside Spencer's humble home. Circa 1930's dustbowl.\n\nInstead of discovering the water he needs to save his family, Spencer finds a demon willing to offer him oceans of water in exchange for one night of service.\nSpencer looking for water.\nThe demon's humble lair\nWill you choose to do the demon's work to save your dying family, or will you go back to your family empty handed and pray for rain?\nREWARDS\nWe're trying to give you guys unique rewards that you can only get from us.

It is a low budget action sci-fi thriller where a Fugitive exiles him self on a remote planet and coming from off world, he discovers that he is smarter and faster than any of the native inhabitants. It starts to go to his head. Loneliness is as common as off road vehicle chases, gun fights and stealing food or equipment so when an Alien Sherif comes after him he actually gains a friend. Not only a friend but an chance to gain amnesty in the Galaxias and return to his previous life. The only problem with this odd feel good story is a woman! A woman with a gun! Justice is served in the end but it needs to be told with a stronger ending.\nUnfortunately Scourge Runner was over shadowed by other productions but to date has been my only full length movie. So after talking with some people about distribution I decided to bring it once again on one of the front burner.\nReviewing the movie after all these years I decided that it could use a little face lift and needed a stronger ending. The ending it has now is ok and tells the story but just needs a louder voice so the story is told more clear and satisfying. Everyone knows how important the ending is and I'd like your help to make it that way.\nTo make this new ending I wrote up a few more scenes to add on, and they will be edited into the existing ending to make the movie end the way it should and to keep the awesomeness to the end!\nTo make this awesome new ending I saved up some and will use the pledge money to make costumes, props, sets, organize details, put together a crew to shoot at the two locations and make some upgrades with my editing equipment.

If for some reason they decide not to work with me, everyone will still get copies of the movie from me just minus the flashy cover.

I have included anecdotes of my life story and my experience of Mormonism, and I seek to ennoble my religious culture (and especially Mormon women) by delicately discussing an association that is dominantly left unclear by the scriptures, rites, culture and protocol of our religion.\nI have incorporated at least 40 of my pen and ink illustrations, most of which involve a style that is born from my admiration of expressionism, futurism, cubism, graffiti, comics, Czech animation and religious iconography. Because of these associations, this book promises to be a unique artifact in my religious culture, which is dominated by nonfiction books that are concerned with ancient studies, apologetics, and religious scholarship.\nBecause I am an artist, this book is more concerned with illuminated lettering, elaborate borders, and visual symbols than it is with scholarship. But I was an English major, so there will be plenty of literary turns, prose, critical theory, and examinations of popular culture to chew on as well.\nTo properly fund a book that I can't afford to publish, I am offering as incentives for pledging all of the original artwork that I can find... which, again, comes out to about 40 pen & ink drawings. Each of these will be signed and framed. I am also printing lovely posters of two of the most pertinent images in the book (the cover and the title page), and giving you the option of procuring either a soft or hard cover version of the book itself.\nAll of the money raised will go towards the publishing of the book. I have set a low goal because I will publish whatever amount of books that I can with whatever total I reach. So the more I raise, the more I can publish. I have also made it easy for you to give any amount you can, as even a single dollar will garner you an acknowledgment in the book (but please consider going beyond that if you can :).\nThank-you so much for checking my project out!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #3", "update_userinfo": "Update on progress :)", "update_content": "Many thanks to those who have pledged to my book!

To all of you, thank-you so much for your help and interest!\nI have been asked a lot of questions about the content of the book, so this update is to provide a link to my public photo album on Facebook that contains examples of my artwork and excerpts of writing associated with each image.

Here's one of my favorite films by Jan Svankmajer: http://www.youtube.com/watch...\nSTORY (5 min short film.)\nThe film is about the relationship between a man and woman, where the man brings into their lives different vices and addictions symbolized in the film by mud, cigarette packages, adult magazines and other filth from the outside world. These items will come to life, crushing the woman's soul. \nWe firmly believe that drug abuse, alcohol, and pornography addiction can break down individuals and tear families apart. We hope this film will serve as a cautionary tale, shedding light on the effects of abuse and encourage those in bad relationships to seek help before it is too late.\nIt sounds dark but it will be told in an unconventional, and beautiful way.\nTECHNIQUE\nThis film will be shot using a combination of stop-motion animation and live action actors. The actors will be animated frame by frame to make the props of mud, rocks, bottles, cans, etc... move across their bodies.\nMy last animated short film \"MuM\" premiered at the Sundance Film Festival and went on to win many awards around the world. Here it is below: http://www.nxtdream.com/project/mum\nHere are two examples of recent commercials I shot using Live action and Animation together: http://www.nxtdream.com/commercials/rogue-tattoo/ http://www.nxtdream.com/commercials/cvs-pharmacy/\nHOW THE MONEY WILL BE USED\nI shot a live-action commercial for a friend of mine a little while ago and we did it all for the price of a lunch. We shot in a place we got for free and in 3-4 hours we were outta there. Post was editorial on my mac, and the sound was music with no foley. So pretty easy to do and it turned out AWESOME. Here's a link: http://www.nxtdream.com/commercials/joel-ward-magician/\nAnimation of this nature, on the other hand can be quite expensive to do it right. You need to rent a place and be there for at least 14-16 days of shooting (not including prep). Gear you can usually borrow from a friend for a day, but for two+ weeks of shooting, you need to pay them something. Same thing with actors and crew. People can work for free for a day or a weekend, but for this type of animation you need to be able to pay people for the 2 week+ time commitment. (Even though our crew will be very very small.)\nAlso we need cash to buy the supplies and props. Bottles, cans, magazines, trash, etc... sounds like free stuff, but we'll have to purchase most of it, and build a small set on stage. Also we'll need gallons of white makeup for the actors to wear everyday... Basically all of the stuff you can get for free for a live-action deal we'll have to pay for.\nFor post there's a lot of work.... in live action you can get a lot of the sound from production and sweeten it with foley. There is no sound while shooting animation, you have to literally re-create EVERYTHIING and mix it in. It's a lot of work, but that's part of the fun of filmmaking.\nMy hope is that kickstarter will allow filmmakers to be able to make great films by testing out new ideas, camera techniques and tell truly original stories. Not as a full time career as a short filmmaker but as something to do in-between paid commercial projects to push new ideas and develop great films that everyone can enjoy.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #34", "update_userinfo": "Hello Drained Friends!", "update_content": "Hello Drained Friends!\nThanks again for making Drained such a success.
