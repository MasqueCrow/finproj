[{"backer": "Deniz Derin \u00d6zer", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Back in 2016, I started designing Aton Playing Cards as a private project to merge my two passions for Egyptian mythology and graphic design. I wanted to create a playful yet sophisticated design that balances the fine line between modern-minimal and classical Egyptian art style. After completing a first version of the then called Wadjet Playing Cards (unreleased), I closed the project with a few individual prototypes.\nAs I rediscovered the cards during lockdown 2020, I began to take on some minor changes and introduce a few new ideas to the design. No sooner had I returned to this project than I was filled with verve and eager to rework the whole design.  \n\nDELUXE tuck boxes feature matte colored paper stock with embossing and gold foil. Embossing on the tuck box alludes to relief sculpture, an art technique used by ancient Egyptian artists to emphasise the three-dimensional structure of the depicted gods and godesses. The gold foil accentuates the highly detailed design and refers to the gilded artworks of ancient Egypt. \nCLASSIC (printed) tuck boxes feature a sleek and modest design. Inspired by the frugal use of color in hieroglyphic wall inscriptions, they pull the attention towards the richly colored cards inside. \nCLASSIC Tuck Boxes\nThe tuck and back designs are inspired by the winged sun disk, the Egyptian symbol of divinity, royalty and power. The disk represents the sun god ATON himself. He is protected by the two goddesses Wadjet (serpent) and Nekhbet (vulture), the patron goddesses of upper and lower Egypt.  \nEbony DELUXE Edition (Gold Foil & Embossing on Tuck Box)\nEbony DELUXE Edition\nEbony CLASSIC Edition\nEach suit represents one of the four major aspects of life in ancient Egypt. They're embodied by the three deities on the corresponding court cards.\nThe red suits represent the two positively connoted aspects of life. Hearts refer to the origin and integrity of Life. Here we find the creator, the protectress and the reviver. Diamonds represent the power of Wisdom, Skill and Magic. The corresponding gods have to rely on physically stronger deities for protection so they can carry out their duties.\nAs the lord of the sun, I appear in a variety of forms. Some call me Ra, others refer to me as Horus. Call me as you like, but remember that it's me who steers the solar barque across the sky. I'm accompanied by multiple gods who assist me on this journey.\nAs a moon god and scribe for the gods, I accompany the lord of the sun during his nightly voyage. I keep him informed of what happens down on earth and in the lands of the dead.\nEvery night, the solar barque is attacked by a monstrous snake. I'm the protectress of the sun god and his scribe. Without my help, the sun would never make it's way through the dangerous nightlands.\nThe controversial aspects of life are represented by the blue suits. Spades are associated with Strength, Violence and Destruction. They feature the most powerful and reckless deities of ancient Egypt. Clubs represent the many facets of Death, including the rites and challenges a decedent undergoes after his/her death.\nI'm the fierce lioness, goddess of warfare and the vengeful aspect of the cat goddess. Once, I was sent to earth to destroy the mortals who conspired against the sun god. In my wrath, I destroyed almost all of humanity and let the Nile flow red.\nI'm the goddess of truth and justice. Your heart will be weighted against my feather. If you lived a virtouous life they will be in balance with eachother and you may hear your verdict from our lord. Else, your journey ends in the reeking maw of a deamoness.\nThis is merely a formality. If you passed every test so far, I can't hold anything against you. Come! I welcome you into my kingdom of eternal life!\nThe Jokers\nThe Aces\nBack Design (circular fan)\nBack Design (open fan)\nPip Cards\n\n\nTamarisk DELUXE Edition (Gold Foil & Embossing on Tuck Box)\nTamarisk DELUXE Edition\nTamarisk CLASSIC Edition\nI'm the ram-headed creator god and the guardian of the Nile's source. I created the bodies for gods and humans from the silt and clay that's washed out during the annual flood of the Nile.\nThe morning sun is embodied by me. Just like the scarab beetle pushes a dung ball, I lift the newly born sun over the horizon.\nI'm the goddess of life and magic. With the help of our divine scribe, I was able to mend and resurrect my slain husband.\nThe Nile is the source of life and growth for all of Egypt. At the same time it holds many unpredictable dangers and is home to a multitude of wild animals. As the god of the Nile, I'm both feared and worshipped at the same time.\nNo other god is feared as much as me! I'm the lord of the red desert, the bringer of chaos and the murderer of my gullible brother Osiris. I hacked him into pieces and scattered them all across egypt.\nFortunately, most of you won't suffer the same fate as Osiris. Still, one day you will find yourself before me. As the god of death it will be my task to guide you through your final judgement. I'm going to embalm and mummify your mortal body, so your heart and soul may proceed to their judgement.\nThe Aces\nBack Design (circular fan)\nBack Design (open fan)\nPip Cards\n\n The CardBack went through a multitude of different designs until it reached it's current and final state.

Therefore, I'm collaborating with experienced professionals who have been working in the playing cards industry for many years. The cards will be printed by USPCC, one of the worlds best renowned playing cards manufacturers. Fulfilment and shipping will be handled by Gambler's Warehouse. They are highly experienced in fulfilling Kickstarter projects in the playing cards industry.\n\nWe are aware, that due to the current COVID-19 situation, the level of unpredictability in the manufacturing process has heightened. We have added one month extra to the estimated fulfillment date. There's a good chance that we'll actually be able to fulfill in September, but the situation is changing daily. We will, of course, keep everyone informed of any changes.\n\nBe aware that printed colours could vary from the ones you see on your screen.

The turning point was the trip to Switzerland in 2019, where during a gloomy and rainy day I accidentally found the museum with an exhibition of gladiatorial armor. I am a big fan of Ridley Scott's films, and one of my favorite - the Gladiator. This exhibition in Switzerland impressed me so much that I started working on the deck dedicated to these strong and courageous men.\nThese decks will not be glamorous as the idea was to create a design that would reflect harsh reality of those difficult days and the strength of spirit of those brave warriors. The restrained and dark colors of the boxes, and the small accent on the foils, symbolize short and instantaneous eruption of glory at the peak of life and the brink of death.\nEveryone decides either to leave with honor, or to stain oneself with blood and shame. Eventually, the same thing awaits all of us - the death. It smiles at us, and all we have to do is to smile back.\nMain features:\nCards printed by EPCC.

We decided to create the world's first crypto card, which can be purchased on Kickstarter. \nWhat is the point, you ask? This is a completely new era of collecting, because now you can not only buy a crypto art, but also sell it legally!  If you have already heard about this kind of art, you understand what profits you can make by selling collectibles on NFT platforms. \n\nWe created a crypto pledge, and it is one of the aces of our deck. It has a three-dimensional format and an animated structure. You can purchase it in this project, and we'll send it to you at the end of the campaign. In addition to this crypto card, you will receive a large JPEG format of this card, which you can print for yourself.\nHowever, to receive crypto card, you will need a special crypto wallet. We will send your crypto card from the Rarible website and you will need the MetaMask wallet, which is one of the most common crypto currency wallets in the world.\n\nHow to creat a virtual wallet and to receive Crypto Card: \nFirst, we recommend you to read this article about crypto art: https://www.theverge.com/22310188/nft-explainer-what-is-blockchain-crypto-art-faq\nBut, if you don\u2019t have much time, we prepared the FAQ list to make it easier for you to understand everything.\nWhat is NFT and crypto art:\n1) What does NFT mean?\nNFT stands for non-fungible token \u2013 a digital token that is a type of crypto currency, much like Bitcoin or Ethereum. However, unlike a standard coin in the Bitcoin blockchain, an NFT is unique and can't be exchanged like-for-like (hence, non-fungible).\n2) What is NFT Crypto ART?\nNFT stands for \u201cnon-fungible token,\u201d and it can technically contain anything digital, including drawings, animated GIFs, songs, or items in video games.\n3) How do NFT work?\nArtists who want to sell their work as NFTs have to sign up with a marketplace, then \u201cmint\u201d digital tokens by uploading and validating their information on a blockchain (typically the Ethereum blockchain, a rival platform to Bitcoin). They can then list their piece for auction on an NFT marketplace, similar to eBay.\n4) Where can I sell or buy NFT?\nThere is a variety of marketplaces on which to buy and sell NFTs: Nifty Gateway, MakersPlace, SuperRare, OpenSea, Decentraland, and Rarible are just a few of many.\nHow to creat a virtual wallet:\nHere is the official website where you can easily download and install your own crypto wallet: https://metamask.io\nIs MetaMask safe?\nMetaMask does not control any of your personal/private data on their servers. Everything is encrypted on your browser and protected via your MetaMask password. Therefore, when you lose your MetaMask accounts, and need to restore MetaMask, you could only do that with your seed phrase.\nAfter receiving this crypto card, you can trade it on crypto platforms, get crypto currency and buy anything!\nIf you have any questions, please write in the comments or in PMs. \nQuantity of copies is limited to 20 - be among the first!\nPLAY\n\n Like Lightning Playing Cards.

Whenever I have some spare time in between commissions, I would try to play around, and make something new and exciting.\n  The idea to create a full deck of playing cards, has long been a pet project of mine and is already in the final stages of design, and almost ready to be produced.\nThis is the part where you come into play! To make this a reality, I need some help from all illustration and playing card enthusiasts.

However, it was very hard to pick a theme among many different elements of Asian culture. Finally, my co-designer and I decided to create the Kasa playing cards. The playing cards set is inspired by the Japanese Noh plays (\u80fd\u697d) and its mask culture. Kasa (\u5098) means \"umbrella\" in Japanese, and it is the main inspiration of the card back.\nNoh or \u80fd is a Sino-Japanese word for \"skill\" or \"talent\". It plays a very major part of the classical Japanese musical drama that has been performed since the 14th century. Usually, the performers dress in traditional costume and wear strange-looking masks during the performance. The box art features 2 different masks depends on the deck: The white mask is a fox mask and the red one is a Tengu(\u5929\u72d7) mask.\nTwo colors of Kasa playing cards\nDark Kasa Playing Cards\n2,500 decks limited edition printed by USPCC\nBicycle branded\nPremium paper stock\nThin crushed for better handling \n      Backs with the traditional umbrella element\n    Jokers -- fox mask and tengu(\u5929\u72d7) mask\n            Wood Kasa Playing Cards\n2,500 decks limited edition printed by USPCC  \nBicycle branded  \nPremium paper stock  \nThin crushed for better handling\n    Backs with the traditional umbrella element\n    Jokers -- fox mask and tengu(\u5929\u72d7) mask\n            A Detailed Look\nWood Kasa , Clubs\n  Wood Kasa, Diamonds\n  Wood Kasa, Spades\n  Wood Kasa, Hearts\n  Wood Kasa, Jack of Spades\n  Wood Kasa, Back\n  Dark Kasa, Back\n  Dark Kasa, Ace of Clubs\n  Dark Kasa, Ace of Hearts\n  Dark Kasa, Ace of Spades\n  Dark Kasa, Ace of Diamonds\n  Dark Kasa, 9s\nAdd-ons \n*Add-ons could be any Kasa decks in any combination.

I do have a small amount of unbranded Sky Descender and unbranded Samsara left, but, as you may notice, they are not included in this project. It is mainly because that I want to keep some of my decks as part of my collection. Branded Sky Descender and Samsara are so sold-out that I, as the creator, can't even afford to open a new deck :( Thus, this project is for Kasa only. I'm sorry if you are new to my cards, or maybe want to buy some of my previous decks.\nAlso, my friends always suggest me to make more cards at a time, at least more than 2,500 decks, but I refused. I do not plan to make a living solely from designing cards. It's just a hobby. I love collecting them and sometimes designing some, that's all.

Well i thought it did, and i was wrong!  \nTwo decades Lost ...\n17 years went by and I never touched magic, not even a french drop. One day my girlfriend found out I used to go to \"Hogwarts\" when I was younger and now I had to show her something. I only could remember one trick and it was her reaction to my performance that inspired all that I am doing right now. I even returned to the college to praise and thank my mentors for the huge impact they had in my life and how they played a massive part in who I am today; funny thing is I only realized all this a year ago!\nHere we are...\nJinto's and Jokers playing cards was created as a way of representing Cape Town and our street identity, the word \"jinto\" (thanks to my great friend Derra) in its harshest translation means Prostitute in Cape Afrikaans Slang, but it can also be used in a lighter term meaning hustler, which is what sleight of hand is built on, and what we here constantly find ourselves doing: Hustling. \nI really was lucky to have worked with such an amazing and gifted designer, Miss Kayleigh Garret, who got my ideas and made this beautiful deck come to life!

The Limited Ed. decks were being sold at really high prices (around 18$), with not the best quality and some of them had zero innovation: always the same designs, but different colours.\nThis made us think about our brand. \u00bfWhat were we going to do about it?\nAs a result, we changed completely our philosophy by not sticking to any philosophy. This might seem absurd, but in a world dominated by trends, we didn't want to follow any of them. This way, our brand will be offering each time completely different and new products, with the best possible quality at the lowest possible price, such as our new Juggler Marble Edition.\n\u00abprogress is impossible without change and those who cannot change their minds cannot change anything\u00bb - George Bernard Shaw\nBack Design\nINSPIRATION\nThe problem with new ideas that hasn't been done before is to think them.

We would like to thank all of our amazing backers for contributing to the unprecedented success of this project.\nFor anyone that missed the Luna Moon deck, you\u2019re not going to leave empty handed either. We present to all our supporters an extremely special Stretch Goal: an opportunity to obtain the Helius Sun deck. After the Moon sets, the Sun rises and brings us a new day and a fresh start filled with courage and excitement.\nHelius Sun Deluxe Edition\nAfter the Moon sets, the Sun rises and brings us a new day and a fresh start filled with courage and excitement. We originally planned on releasing the Helius Sun deck on the anniversary of the Luna Moon deck next year, but we received such overwhelming support in the first 48 hours of the launch we couldn\u2019t help but release it now. Since we are entering spring, we want to celebrate the warmth that we are about to receive and we hope that the new year can let you shine and prosper!\nClassic Edition (Left) & Deluex Edition (Right)\nThe Helius Sun Playing Card includes 2 versions: a Classic Edition (Left) and a Deluxe Edition (Right). The box for Helius Sun is just as special as Luna Moon, and incorporates some complimentary details. The Maroon Red box is reminiscent of the Sun\u2019s flaming heat. The rigid, hexagon opening represents the Sun\u2019s fierceness. The opening of the box is like sunray beaming towards us on Earth, providing the warmth and freedom that we so desperately after months of freezing cold.\nThe Helius Sun deck is extremely meaningful to us in a way since we incorporated a unforgettable sunrise we saw during a trip into the design. If you haven\u2019t had the opportunity yet, you absolutely must watch the sun rise from the horizon with someone you love. We promise you won\u2019t ever forget it.\nHelius Sun Classic Edition\nThe back of the cards is focused on illustrations of the Sun, but if you look very closely at there is a Moon crescent hugging the Sun. The flashes of red stars in the background hints at the many suns we see across the universe, and their powerful bursts are best captured in the crimson red. \n  The Joker is a flaming hot Sun with scorching rays emitting from the surface. The simple artwork at the corners are depictions of dawn and when the Sun rises, there is an alluring spectacle created and we wanted to capture that in the cards.\nThe Ace of Spades is taken from an altar on the highest mountain in China, TaiShan. It is a prime location to see the sunrise above the clouds and having travelled there ourselves it was a sight we cannot forget for the rest of our lives.\nThe inspiration for the deck is drawn from historical significance of the moon in both Western and Chinese culture. It is a symbol of change and repetitive cycles in life. The moon is associated with family, especially during the mid-autumn festival where mooncakes are to be eaten with a reunited family. \nThe moon waxes and wanes from empty to full and it\u2019s a great reflection of our lives. There are peaks and troughs in our lives through which we must progress and improve ourselves. But whenever we are too burdened with thoughts at night, gazing up at the moon removes all the unnecessary anxiety and clears the mind.\nToday, however, the moon is hidden behind city lights and skyscrapers. But if you ever feel the need at night, take some time to gaze at the moon. We hope it can bring clarity to you just as it has brought us.\nHere is the showcase video of Luna Moon Playing Cards, featuring the One and Only Joe Feldpausch (Instagram: Joefldpsch).\nIn the current environment, the design of playing card peripheral products have matured. It is very challenging to take a new path and especially create a new path, but someone has to confront the incumbent. After six months of brainstorming and design, Bocopo created this revolutionary deluxe case.\nLuna Moon Deluxe Edition\nThe Luna Playing Card includes 2 versions: a Classic case Edition (Left) and a Deluxe case Edition (Right). Both editions are highly limited with only 2500 each. Once the Kickstarter is end, the retail value will be Doubled.\nClassic Edition (Left) & Deluex Edition (Right)\nDeluxe Edition Luna Moon\nWe wanted to incorporate the different phases of the moon into the case, but it was extremely to show visually demonstrate in a normal case. An idea came to us while peeling an orange: to open the case with multiple layers and each layer representing a phase of the moon from empty to full.\nClassic Edition Luna Moon\n The case is fanned open to produce a stunning and dazzling experience. Through the gaps between the different cases, the different phases of the moon are uncovered. Every element of the case is a true testament to craftsmanship and imagination.\nThe back of the card is the view of the starry night sky looking into the Milky Way. With the sun is in the far distant background, the Moon shines guidance to all. The deep indigo background contrasts nicely with the golden light reflected off the Moon.\nThe Jokers consist of a Sun and Moon combo, for the Moon cannot shine without the Sun. The role of the two have been reversed in this theme, with the Moon having higher priority. We constructed orbiting planets around the Moon to express our admiration for the Moon and how it is under-appreciated by many. It can and should be worshipped as much as the Sun.\nThe Ace of Spades is like the letter A but with moonshine beaming from the Moon to the round Earth. The reflective light at guides those still awake at night and shines through the confusion hidden in the darkness.\n The Face cards for the deck are drawn without emotions or faces even. Instead, the highlight lies in the different white crescents. The mirrored streaks injects a sense of motion into the characters, and leaves their faces for your imagination.\nThe box of the Deluxe Editon is made from Kurz foil paper from Germany and Neenah Paper from France are carefully chosen to construct the case. These special materials each cost more than 7 times of regular supplies. Every box is completely hand-crafted by skilled artisans, and each takes 15 to 20 minutes to create. Their devotion and expertise can be felt from the moment you pick up the deck.\nThis is the Uncut Tuck Case of Luna Moon Deluxe Edition. This is an extremely rare item that we decided to make available to our supportive collectors ONLY on Kickstarter. When you pledge for the 6 sets or 12 sets tires of Luna Moon Playing Cards, this item will be Gifted to your collection and each sheet will be Numbered & Signed by Kevin Yu himself.\nThe Deck will be printed with USPCC, Air Cushion Finish, Casino Stock.

I admire these cards for their fidelity to the source material, rendering creatively and beautifully the myths of the Viking Age for a 21st-century card player. Of the projects I've consulted on, this is among my top favorites.\"  \nDr. Jackson Crawford, Instructor of Nordic Studies and Nordic Program Coordinator at the University of Colorado Boulder \nThe interest in the Norse gods has grown substantially in popularity from the emerging archeological finds, television shows, and Marvel movies. We are learning more about the Viking culture every day and people want more! We decided we wanted more as well - a playing card deck featuring a more authentic interpretation of the Norse gods. So, we went digging into the sagas and decided to create a deck based on the famous final battle of Ragnar\u00f6k.  \nThrough that research, we discovered Dr. Jackson Crawford, Instructor of Nordic Studies and Nordic Program Coordinator at the University of Colorado Boulder and author of The Poetic Edda: Stories of the Norse Gods and Heroes and The Saga of the Volsungs: With the Saga of Ragnar Lothbrok and a wealth of knowledge on everything Viking. \nWith Dr. Crawford's personal consulting and guidance for this project we were able to incorporate the correct, strict Old Norse names and descriptions for these mighty figures of legend, depictions so accurate to the original sources that Dr. Crawford has even suggested they be used in an academic environment!  \nThe outcome of all this work is a stunning deck that the gods themselves would be proud of - GJALLARHORN!\nWhat is GJALLARHORN?\nGJALLARHORN, or the Yelling Horn, is known by many as the horn wielded by Heimdallr to announce the coming of Ragnar\u00f6k.When sounded, all of the players of the final battle will gather; Odin, Thor, Loki, Hel, Tyr, and many others. Once gathered, the mighty battle will begin. Here, in this unique deck, we have gathered the deities and creatures who will play an important role in this battle. The GJALLARHORN is sounding! Will you join your fellow warriors in battle?\nA deck worthy of the gods! We have taken every step to ensure that the GJALLARHORN Deck will be the pinnacle of quality: \n\u25ba High Quality 310 gsm German card stock\n\u25ba Unique Norse mammen art style inspired box and card designs. \n\u25ba Gold/Silver foiled, embossed tuck boxes\n\u25ba 100% unique courts illustrated by hand in the Art Nouveau style\n\u25ba Gold/Silver metallic inks for card backs\n\u25ba 54 poker sized playing cards (52 cards + 2 jokers)\n\u25ba Printed by NPCC with premium linen finish\n\u25ba Savings on each deck with higher tier pledges\n\u25ba All artwork is complete and ready to print\n\u25ba Rewards shipped to backers in protective boxes\n* To add a deck to an existing pledge simply add $16 per deck.\nThe striking box design of the GJALLARHORN deck incorporates elements from the card back design to create a cohesive deck that is sure to inspire.

Welcome to the redesign Kickstarter launch for Grid Series Two, the typographic playing cards.  \nThe Grid playing cards are a three part collection based on the design principals of the International Typographic Style, otherwise known as the \u2018Swiss Style\u2019 of graphic design. Series Two has been reworked from its original launch because I wanted to refine the design and bring the whole deck closer to the original concept set out by Series One. I feel now, the whole deck has a cleaner more precise and elegant look, one that is important to have in every collection.\nGrid Series Two - Standard Edition\nOriginally starting in the 1920s in Germany, the Netherlands and Russia, the \u2018Swiss Style\u2019 later developed in Switzerland in the 1950s. It\u2019s main principals are readability and cleanliness, with most creations adopting an asymmetric layout, always based on the use of a grid. These grids, usually made up of hidden columns and rows, are used to align words, numbers, pictures and patterns and so each series in the Grid collection adopts these principals. The works of designers such as Ernst Keller and Josef-M\u00fcller Brockmann have been a real inspiration from a graphic point of view. \nGrid Series Two - Standard Edition\n  Grid Series Two - Standard Edition\nThe cards are poker size and printed by USPCC but are far from traditional. These cards will be printed on linen, magic air cushion stock which I know first hand really does feel like nothing else with fully customised tuck box and seal. As a graphic designer more than an illustrator, as well as a card collector, I wanted to find a way to combine two of my biggest passions and make a collection of decks which truly stand out from the crowd. I fully appreciate the incredible work of designers of other playing cards currently in the world, I am often drawn to the cards with incredible detail and illustration. After all, I am a Kickstarter backer as well as a creator. Personally, I see the detail of my decks as \u2018less is more\u2019, doing away with traditional pips and instead adopting a typographic format, with each card acting like a miniature poster, with bold words setting the theme rather than illustration and numbers.\nGrid Series Two - Standard Edition\n  Grid Series Two - Standard Edition\nI have tried to keep the design minimal but functional, even the back of the card is super stripped back to just the name of the deck, with full colour bleed for real impact of colour. If, for example, you look at my version of the picture cards, they each have a diagonal line introduced as a minimal graphic, like a poster, but it replicates the diagonal line often found on traditional picture cards where the suit is duplicated and rotated. It\u2019s a small detail but it\u2019s my way of reflecting tradition.\nGrid Series Two - Standard Edition\n  Grid Series Two - Standard Edition\nWith Grid Series Two, as well as vertical and horizontal alignment like in Grid Series One, I have introduced the circle to create a dial effect and explore how different grids can be adopted on playing cards. Each card has a bespoke set of alignment with the numbers and letters that sit on the edge of the circle so that they visually look to have the same alignment, whilst not always sitting in exactly the same place on each card.\nGrid Series Two - Standard Edition\n  Grid Series Two - Standard Edition\nThe cards can be read and viewed in many different ways with only two being symmetrical.\nA) The card is written in it\u2019s full name; seven of diamonds. \nB) Traditional use in the corners with 7 and the diamond pip. \nC) Written with upper and lowercase next to it; Seven / Diamonds. \nD) Around the circle there is the current sequence of cards before and after; 6 7 8. \nE) Short hand code in the upper right corner; se/di \nF) In the lower left corner similar to Grid Series One, the current card is shown by the pip and lit up dots, with ones that don\u2019t apply being faded out for ace to ten, and then switching to diagonal lines for the picture cards; diamond pip with 7 white dots.\nGrid Series Two - Standard Edition\n  Grid Series Two - Standard Edition\n  Each backer will receive 2 free phone background images of their selected cards available for download, as well as a PDF certificate of gratification to download. This is to say thank you and will include your name and backer number. Backers who would like these bonus items just need to message me after funding to confirm selection and I can send the files to them.\nTwo custom phone backgrounds for every backer\n   Signed Standard Edition\nIf you would like your deck signed, simply increase your pledge by \u00a35 per deck and message me to confirm this add on. You will be able to choose where the deck is signed and if you would like it resealed with protective plastic cellophane.\nLimited Edition\nThe limited edition Grid Series Two deck is an extremely rare product. There will only be 20 made, they will also never be printed again. These will be printed on professional grade plastic coated, lower stock than the standard edition, the same I used for Series One limited edition, this is purely because the print run is so small, I need to use a different printer to get them made. From previous campaigns, I know these are highly sought after, so keeping them so limited increases their exclusivity.\nUpdate - I did post this in my first update but thought best to note it here as well; the limited edition decks are currently all reserved, but if you would like to be added to the waiting list please still do message me!\nGrid Series Two - Limited Edition\n  Grid Series Two - Limited Edition\nEvery deck will be numbered and signed in a place of the backers choice. There is no limit to how many decks each backer can request out of the 20 made. Every deck will come with a printed certificate of ownership, signed and numbered to match the deck.\nGrid Series Two - Limited Edition\n  Grid Series Two - Limited Edition\nEach deck will cost \u00a325 which includes delivery and certificate of ownership. If you would like to add on any limited edition decks, please private message me directly to reserve a deck and be added to the waiting list.

I graduated in graphic design in 2017 and decided to start as a freelance and realize my own projects. With my Micron pen and my paper, I am giving life to my universe by drawing inspiration from my surroundings. The nature and animals are very present in my drawings that are often full of details, in black and white, sometimes with hints of red. I also use a lot of dotwork and geometrical elements.\nPackaging of LM Playing Cards\nQUEL EST MON PROJET ? / WHAT'S MY PROJECT ?\nMon projet est un jeu de 54 cartes ayant une illustration unique pour chacune d\u2019entre elles. \u00c0 travers ces cartes, vous trouverez une invitation \u00e0 l\u2019aventure, au voyage. Ici se m\u00ealent principalement faune et flore dans un imaginaire tout en d\u00e9tails et en po\u00e9sie. Ce projet a \u00e9t\u00e9 con\u00e7u dans l\u2019id\u00e9e d\u2019aborder le jeu de cartes sous un angle diff\u00e9rent, plut\u00f4t comme un objet de collection avec lequel on pourrait jouer comme on le souhaite. Dans ce jeu, chaque valeur correspond \u00e0 un th\u00e8me, pour certains plus abstraits que d\u2019autres. Les voici : \n 2 : des r\u00e9f\u00e9rences personnelles faisant un clin d\u2019oeil \u00e0 des moments ou des personnes qui ont contribu\u00e9es de pr\u00e8s ou de loin \u00e0 la mise en forme de ce projet \n3 : la mer, l\u2019oc\u00e9an \n4 : les 4 \u00e9l\u00e9ments \n5 : le road trip \n6 : le temps, l\u2019attente \n7 : l\u2019espace, l\u2019astronomie \n8 : la l\u00e9g\u00e8ret\u00e9, la fragilit\u00e9 \n9 : les 4 saisons \n10 : l\u2019exotisme, l\u2019\u00e9cologie \nValets/reines/rois : les animaux incarnants pour moi les caract\u00e9ristiques de ces valeurs \nAs : la repr\u00e9sentation des 4 techniques principales que j\u2019utilise dans mes dessins (g\u00e9ometrie, dotwork, aplats, d\u00e9tails au trait) \nJoker : une vision fantaisiste et personnelle des jokers avec la folie et la festivit\u00e9 de la bi\u00e8re, la malice et l\u2019intelligence du raton laveur  \nMy project is a deck of 54 playing cards with a unique illustration for each one. These cards are an invitation to adventure and travel. Flora and fauna combine in an imagination all in details and poetry. This project was conceived by thinking of playing cards from a different angle, much more like an collector's item that you could manipulate and play with as you like. In this deck, each value represents a theme, some more abstract than others :\n 2 : personal references to moments or people that contributed to this whole project in a way or another \n3 : the sea, the ocean \n4 : the 4 elements \n5 : road trip \n6 : time and its course \n7 : space and astronomy \n8 : lightness and fragility \n9 : the 4 seasons \n10 : exotism, ecology \nJacks / Queens / Kings : i tried to pick subjects that reflects the figures' characteristics \nAces : the representation of the 4 main techniques that i use: geometric, dotwork, patches and details with lines \nJokers : a fancy and personal vision of the jokers with the pep and festivity of the beer, and the mischief and cunning of the raccoon.\nAces\n  Some of the cards\n  Queen of Spades\n  Jokers\nL\u2019id\u00e9e de ce projet m\u2019est venue il y a maintenant 2 ans et demi. En suivant le travail de l\u2019illustrateur Kerby Rosanes qui a particip\u00e9 \u00e0 un jeu de cartes avec plusieurs autres artistes (Playing Arts), j\u2019ai trouv\u00e9 cette nouvelle vision des cartes absolument g\u00e9niale. Color\u00e9e, surprenante, unique. L\u2019envie de cr\u00e9er mon propre jeu de cartes est donc venue tout naturellement. J\u2019ai d\u2019abord cr\u00e9e une premi\u00e8re version enti\u00e8rement \u00abfait maison\u00bb puis, sous les conseils de mes proches, j\u2019ai d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de le retravailler pour l\u2019imprimer et le commercialiser. Les photos que vous pouvez voir sont le prototype du jeu qui va donc \u00eatre imprim\u00e9. \nThe idea of the project came to me 2 and a half years ago. Then, following the example of Illustrator Kerby Rosanes who participated to the creation of a deck of cards (Playing Arts), along with several other artists, I found that new vision absolutely awesome. Colorful, surprising, unique. The desire of creating my own deck therefore came rather naturally. I made a first homemade version, then under the advice of my friends and family, I decided to rework it in order to print and commercialize it. The photos you see are from the prototype of the deck that is going to be printed.\nPrototype\n     Back of the cards\n QUEL EST MON PLAN ET MON BUDGET ? / WHAT'S MY PLAN AND MY BUDGET ?\nPour imprimer ce jeu de cartes, j\u2019ai choisi Cartamundi qui existe depuis 1765 et qui est reconnu pour la qualit\u00e9 de ses services, ayant notamment travaill\u00e9 pour Monopoly, Uno, Pokemon et bien d\u2019autres. C\u2019est la premi\u00e8re fois que je me lance dans un tel projet et pour une premi\u00e8re impression j\u2019ai d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de commencer avec 250 exemplaires, comprenant les cartes (56x87mm) et leur \u00e9tui. D\u00e8s la fin du Kickstarter, apr\u00e8s l\u2019impression r\u00e9alis\u00e9e et les jeux de cartes r\u00e9ceptionn\u00e9s, je m\u2019attelerai \u00e0 l\u2019envoi des commandes (pour la livraison il faut compter d\u00e9but mars). Pour les retardataires n\u2019ayant pas pu commander leur jeu via Kickstarter, il vous sera possible de vous le procurer sur le site Etsy qui permet aux cr\u00e9ateurs et aux artistes de vendre leurs cr\u00e9ations. Il sera vendu au m\u00eame prix qui est de 20\u20ac. Mais pour r\u00e9aliser ce projet, j\u2019ai besoin de votre aide ! En effet, les fonds r\u00e9colt\u00e9s serviront \u00e0 payer : \nl\u2019impression des cartes et de leur \u00e9tui \nles frais d\u2019envoi \nles frais d\u2019emballage \nles frais mat\u00e9riel \nEt si jamais l\u2019objectif se voit d\u00e9pass\u00e9, une quantit\u00e9 plus importante de jeux de cartes pourra \u00eatre imprim\u00e9e, une autre version du jeu pourra \u00eatre envisag\u00e9 (coffret, \u00e9dition sp\u00e9ciale, planches non d\u00e9coup\u00e9es de toutes les cartes ...), voir m\u00eame des collaborations.\nTo print this deck, I chose Cartamundi, which exists since 1765 and is recognized for the quality of its services, having worked for Monopoly, Uno, Pokemon and many others. It's the first time that I am realizing a project like this and for a first order, I decided to start with 250 decks, comprised of the cards (56x87mm) and their case. Once the Kickstarter ends and after the packs are printed and delivered to me, I will then procede to send all the orders (you will have to wait early march for the delivery). For those late to the party that couldn't order their game through Kickstarter, It will still be possible to order it on Etsy, a website made for creators and artists to sell their work. It will be sold to the same price of 20\u20ac. But to finalize this project, I need your help ! The funds gathered will be used to pay :\nThe printing of the cards and cases\nThe expedition fees\nThe packing fees\nThe materials cost\nThe printing of the cards and cases The expedition fees The packing fees The materials cost If the funds gathered exceed what i expected, a bigger quantity of decks could be printed, other variations could be considered (luxury box, other versions, uncut sheets, ...) or even collaborations.\n  All the cards of the game\nVous pouvez voir mon travail sur les diff\u00e9rentes plateformes ci-dessous.\nYou can look at my work on the different platforms below. \nInstagram\nDeviantArt\nTumblr\nBehance \nPinterest \nFacebook", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nJe me suis document\u00e9e du mieux possible, j\u2019ai contact\u00e9 dif\u00e9rentes personnes ayant d\u00e9j\u00e0 particip\u00e9 ou cr\u00e9\u00e9 un projet comme celui-ci.

With shades of cherry wine red and buttery yellow, the colours complement one another and fuse to create a unique pattern. This harmonious composition awakes the sense of a warm winter, thus; \u201cWinter Warmth\u201d.  \nThe design \nWe wanted to continue the trend of assembling diamonds together in such a way that it creates a geometrically pleasing pattern with vivid colours that pop when fanned, flourished and dealt. This time around we decided to change the index to the traditional font to make it easier to play with. We continue to work with the quality of the USPCC to ensure that the cards are top-class. This guarantees that N\u00b0 5 will be even better than the previous version N\u00b0 2.\n*Note that most of the the pictures still work with the old index. See picture below for the updated index.\n    The cards will be printed on Bicycle grade stock by the United States Playing Card Company with the renowned Air-cushion finish. Additionally, the cards will retain the crushed stock and traditional cut. This will guarantee outstanding handling so you can perform with ease. One deck contains 56 uniquely designed playing cards and a custom tuck box.\nN\u00b0 5 & N\u00b0 2 Reward Tier\nDidn't have the chance to get your hands on our first deck?

Throughout the campaign we will post occasional updates, so you can stay up to date with what is going on on our side.

A savage, no-holds-barred design that captured the authentic, uncaged outlaw spirit and the fierce freedom these born-to-ride rebels live for.\nThe Outlaw artwork is in the hands of the big dogs at the U.S Playing Card Co. They're ready to crank up their gears and print these bad boys at the highest quality, however...\n...there's just one rebel in my crew missing. You.\nLike every deck I create, I've invested hundreds of hours, days and nights into designing the Outlaws. It's my passion, but they'll never become a reality without you.  By becoming a backer you're giving me the critical support I need to pay for the entire production and bring this deck to life.  If you're down to ride with me, grab some rebel Outlaw decks from the reward tiers and share the project with a friend, I can't do this without you.\n It's time to play a little dangerously.\nFor the hell-raisers who live on the edge...The wild ones, trouble-makers, rebels and risk-takers... these are the Outlaw playing cards.\nA vicious, striking black and white design with an authentic armory of iconic outlaw motorcycle club details. With a sharp, custom bordered edge to set it off, the Outlaws are a savage feat of design bad-assery with a gritty wildness that commands attention and roars with attitude. \n Caged in a heavyweight, raw, smokey matte black tuck box, every fine detail of the design will be stamped in a lighting-white foil with precision embossing all around. We\u2019re crafting a metallic black and silver foil deck seal to keep these troublemakers protected, featuring a custom die-cut edge design you won\u2019t find anywhere else out there.\nA Motorcycle Club ain't worth a damn if you don't have an Official Club patch. The most iconic card in the deck, the Ace of Spades is emblazoned with the fearless skull and spade rider patch to show the world who you ride or die for.\nInked up and armed to the teeth, this is a serious band of mofos. A custom-illustrated rebel crew of court cards in authentic leather \u2018cuts\u2019 and official club patches. Scarred, smoking and dangerously good looking, the Outlaw court cards feature some of the most bad ass Jacks, beautiful Queens and toughest Kings you\u2018ll ever deal with.\nNo Outlaw is complete without their F.T.W. patch (which stands for \u201cf*** the world\u201d, but you knew that). The Outlaw Joker is a down and dirty rebel-twist on the old-school Bicycle\u00ae 808 Rider Back Joker we know and love. Instead of riding some punk bicycle, we\u2019ve got our leather-clad Outlaw King thundering down the highway on his iron steed, flipping off the entire world as he goes. That\u2019s one bad hombre.\nIn true Outlaw style, I've kept it gritty, real and raw. The faces are bold, straight-talkin\u2019 and a lil' rough around the edges. A custom but classic pip design in blood red, and deep black with a worn texture. A functional layout, they\u2018re strong and stylised but clear and easy to read no matter what your game. Even at 5 am in the bar all whiskey\u2019d up after one helluva night. \nWhether your game is poker, magic or cardistry, the Outlaws are down to ride with you \u2018till the end.\nLike any free-wheelin' Outlaw knows, standard just doesn\u2019t cut it. Packin' attitude in every deck, these bad boys are nothin\u2019 but custom from the ground up. With the U.S. Playing Card Co, Clove St. Press and Art of Play involved in manufacturing this deck at the highest standards, the Outlaw deck will be one serious weapon of mass deception.\nFEATURES\nA vicious, custom-edged bordered back design, it's authentic to its outlaw core. A rebel design that strikes fear into the squares of society, it's a wild ride of a back design.\nWith fully-custom designed faces, Outlaw features 12 illustrated bad-ass court cards, 40 bold 'n' gritty faces, 2 rebel rider jokers, a custom Ace of Spades club patch design and a special \"db\" gaff card.\nThe playing cards will be printed by the big dogs themselves, the U.S. Playing Card Co. at the highest production quality. Original rebel motorcycle clubs were born on US soil, so it only makes sense.\nPrinted on a Premium, Casino-Grade CRUSHED card stock with signature Air-Cushion Finish and a Traditional Cut, it's the smoothest ride out there. A deck made just the way the card gods intended.\nArmoured by a premium weight, extra tough, smokey midnight matte black tuck box with a lightning white foil stamp and registered embossing crafted by the letterpress artisans at Clove St. Press. \nProtected by a metallic black and silver foil seal, custom-made from a unique die-cut of our own design. You won\u2019t catch anyone else out there with one like it. \nProfessionally assembled and wrapped for protection by the in-house experts at Art of Play, ready for carefully packing and shipping to you. \n*Please note: I've done my best to showcase the deck accurately in the mock-up photographs above but some details may be subject to change during the production process. I guarantee any changes will be minor in appearance and only implemented to add value and/or improve. It will not lower the overall design or impact at all.\nOnce you\u2019ve chosen your main reward tier from right, you can always add-on extra items (listed below). This is how...Step 1) Simply add up the total cost of your chosen add-ons using prices for either a US or International backer. 2) Find your chosen Reward Tier from the list on the right (you must already have chosen a reward). 3) click to edit it. 4) manually add that extra cost on top of your total pledge.\nPlease remember what items you added the extra money for (e.g. 1 t-shirt,1 uncut sheet 1 extra deck, US shipping ), so later you can specify exactly which items the extra funds are for on the survey.\n              Once the Kickstarter campaign ends, we will be using a great service called BackerKit to help manage all pledges, specifically helping to choose any add-ons and extras, finalize/update addresses etc. Each backer will be sent an invite to a BackerKit survey once Kickstarter has processed all funds.\n  I'll also be working with the seasoned pro's at Art of Play in California to help us safely ship all rewards from the U.S. to the world.  This means we've also included US shipping for all reward tiers. And that cost is further used to subsidise international shipping for Non-US backers based on Art of Play's rates.\nArt of Play are a Dan & Dave company, known and trusted experts in the playing card industry and are responsible for safely shipping thousands of premium playing cards to customers around the world every month, so we'll be in good hands. As elements of the deck are actually being produced and finished in California too, it will also serve to minimise the moving parts of the process and keep production as streamlined and effective as possible.\nKnow someone who'd like this deck?\n  Whether you get your kicks from cards, magic, or cardisty, design, poker, or motorbikes, I hope the Outlaws will give you one more damn good reason to crack open a new deck and do what you enjoy. If you're down to ride, grab a few decks and share the project with your squad to help me make it happen. I can't do it without your support. Thank you,\nLee\nFollow along with me at Kings & Crooks for more playing card photography, updates and announcements along the way:\n         ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis will be my third project on Kickstarter, and 5th deck that I've produced so far. I'm familiar with navigating the entire process and although I'm based in Australia, I have developed good relationships with the US playing card co and other US-based suppliers, which has allowed me to successfully make and ship thousands of decks to backers in the US and around the world without any major issues. \n\nAlthough having the tuck box printed and assembled outside of USPC is a new element of production to me, the suppliers I'm working with (Clove St. Press and Art of Play) are very experienced and set up to complete exactly what's required, so I don't foresee any problems.\n\nAny potential challenges that arise will always be communicated to my backers along the way via the project updates. I'm certainly not a project creator who will leave you hanging for the entire 30 days with zero communication. (But I also won't blast you with unnecessary updates too)\n\nDuring my last project to create a card clip/holder, I experienced significant challenges, delays and huge personal loss in bringing it to fruition. However, the actual playing card element of the project (and t-shirts, coins, uncut sheets), were produced without issue. Concerning the card clip accessory, I never quit, and after great pains, I'm happy to say we are now on the road to completion after all.\n\nI mention this to be fully transparent and show I will do what it takes to honor my promise to you. Choosing to back me with your hard-earned money is not something I take lightly. You can expect total honesty and my dedicated devotion to successfully producing and delivering this project to you.

The most obvious is the mythologycal and astral aspect of the Earth's satellite. \nThe hidden face is the psychologic aspect: the Moon is also the symbol of the mercurial human emotion, that can change from sadness to happiness in a blink of an eye.\nEquinox\nEquinox, in astronomy, is the event when the Sun can be observed to be directly above the equator. Occurs twice each year, around 20 March and 23 September. On an equinox, day and night are of approximately equal duration all over the planet. In Lunatica, Equinox is the symbol of balance, the beginning and Life.\nSolstice\nThe Solstice occurs twice each year, around June 21 and December 22 - The day of the solstice has either the most sunlight of the year (summer solstice) or the least sunlight of the year (winter solstice) for any place other than the equator. In Lunatica, Solstice is the symbol of the extreme unbalance, the end and Death.\nChimera\nChimera is a mythologic, monstrous fire-breathing hybrid creature, composed of the parts of more than one animal. The term \"Chimera\" is used, both in italian and english, to describe anything is percieved as imaginative, implausible, or dazzling.\nLunatica's Chimera has the soul of a monster, but it's the symbol of the Crescent Moon...young, crazy, full of life and hope.\nChimera is also the symbol of the impossible dreams: the ones we love to hunt, but that are hard to reach.\nPhoenix\nPhoenix is a mythologic bird that cyclically dies and is reborn. After a Phoenix die in a show of flames and combustion, a new Phoenix arise from the ashes of its predecessor. \nUsually Phoenix is associated with the Sun, but in Lunatica, it is a dying version of the Goddess of the Night - the Waning Moon.\nThe Phoenix is also the symbol of the human capability to recover after a trauma.\nPhoenix is dying - and she's sad. But she's also filled with hope, since she knows that she'll be reborn as a Chimera after a few days.\nFor cardistry, collecting and play\nLunatica is the first cardistry oriented project of Thirdway Industries: it's focused on cards in terms of design, ink, materials and handling - the tuck box of Equinox and Solstice will be relatively simple, compared to my other projects.  \nAnyway, I also love to design premium tuck boxes as well, so I wanted to offer two special collector's versions of the unlimited decks: Chimera and Phoenix.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is my eighth Kickstarter, I already printed Evil Deck, Delirium, Omnia, Dedalo, Pantheon, SINS and Eva.

They have already shipped a lot of Kickstarter decks and have a lot of experience in this field.\n\nOf course problems might happens.

The first leg of this project has already been completed, and I\u2019ve been truly floored by the positive responses and the love that it has elicited from all parts of the world. The 1998 deck is a 4-part series that uses legendary Hip Hop artists as it\u2019s imagery, but still follows the size and layout guidelines of official poker cards. \n I\u2019ve created The Biggie Deck (see the video). Now i'm trying to mass produce The Nas Deck. In each of the decks the legendary rappers shift their position and the artwork evolves. So, when the series of 4 is finally completed, Biggie Smalls will be the King of \u2018Spades\u2019, \u2018Clubs\u2019, \u2018Diamonds\u2019 and \u2018Hearts\u2019; all with different coloration and design variations. This deck was created with Spades players in mind. In this iteration of the deck, Nas leads as the power card when he becomes the King of Spades. However, because this deck follows standard guidelines, it can be used for any of your favorite card games. \nHere is where I need your help! I need money to produce the deck and to get it shipped. I have exhausted over 300 hours of design work to create the Biggie deck alone! This project is a true labor of love. I\u2019m pushed by my passion for the project and fueled by the people who have told me they\u2019ve used my artwork to unwind after a stressful week. \nWHY 1998?: I had to figure out how to narrow down amongst the all of the legendary artists in hip hop. It was clear to me that the biggest rivalries in Hip Hop\u2019s history had to be illustrated. After all\u2026card games are a battle. One day I ran across an old Magazine cover. It had Foxy Brown, Missy Elliott, Lauryn Hill and Lil Kim on it. Perfect! I\u2019d wanted it to be within the Biggie / Tupac era and I needed to find four powerful women for all my queens. I told myself whatever year was on the spine of that magazine would underline the deck. And so, The 1998 Deck was born.\n  The Jay Z Deck - Our Stretch Goal\n                     Photo by Grant Sylvester\n                                                                                              Ace of Spades\n  Nas as the King of Spades and the Leader of this deck\n  Foxy Brown as Queen of Spades\n  Snoop Dogg as the Jack of Spades\n  10 of spades\n    Photo by Grant Sylvester\n  Ace of Clubs Rimmed by Tupac's Bandana\n   Biggie as King of Clubs\n    Lil Kim as Queen of Clubs\n    DMX as Jack of Clubs\n  10 of Clubs\n    Photo by Grant Sylvester\n      Ace of Diamonds Surrounded by 'Killer Bees'\n    Tupac as King of Diamonds\n    Lauryn Hill as Queen of Diamonds\n  Outkast as Jack of Diamonds\n  10 of Diamonds\n    Jay Z as King of Hearts\n    Ace of Hearts.

The modern hipster image has been proliferated through the Internet, fashion, and art world and it's changing continually, but several aspects have stayed constant over time.\nHipsteria box\nA subculture that value independent thinking, counter-culture, progressive politics, indie-rock, creativity, intelligence, witty banter and so on. Hipsters reject cultural attitudes of mainstream consumers, and are often be seen wearing vintage inspired clothes, tight-fitting jeans, old-school sneakers, and thick rimmed glasses. We may love hipsters or not, but they are definitely a part of world culture.\nHipsteria card back\n  The art of Hipsteria playing cards was created by Slava Shestopalov (Behance, Dribbble). He says, \u201cThis deck represents the most remarkable elements of hipster subculture, designed in a minimalistic manner. During the working process, I've made all the sketches by hand and then finished them on the computer.\u201d\nOutdoor sketching\nHipsteria is created in the line-art manner. Every character and thing is a smart combination of lines, arches, curves and dots.\nDesigning the box\nAll the illustrations were sketched by means of black liners, special ink pens that produce perfect lines of different thickness.\nInspired by forest\nIllustrations follow a certain style and proportions, so all the 54 cards look nice together.\nThe devil is in the detail\n  This deck consists of 54 playing cards and each card has its unique design. These cards will become a good choice for youth and collectors, as they can be used in trips, at youth hostels or pubs, as a tabletop game for the family evening or become a part of the collection.\nThe printing company will be NPCC.\nSeven hipster topics told by the cards\nThe deck touches 7 hipster topics: food, interior, accessories and tools, clothes, hipster people, logos and emblems, and fun.\nCourt cards\n    Hipster accessories and tools\n\u201cMy idea was to make each piece of the deck individual even if it is a numeric card. Hipsteria numeric cards contain the quantity of items that matches their value\u201d, says Slava.\nAces are inspired by hipster logos and marks\n    Clubs show hipster's interior decoration\n  The funniest part of the deck\n  A bit of hipster yummies\n  Pattern for the inner part of the box\n  Our project doesn't finish with just printing a deck of cards. There are some additional goals that can be reached thanks to your support.\nAzure Hipsteria deck\nWhen the budget reaches $6000, we'll unlock chocy variant of Hipsteria.\nChocy Hipsteria deck\n$7500 funding will allow us to add one more color option \u2014 milky.\nMilky Hipsteria deck\nYou'll be able to choose the color or colors of the deck you want to receive in a special survey.\nA set of three color variants\nBacking of $9000 is a great chance to print true hipster notepads with the line-art illustration on the cover. You'll be able to use it for score sheets that are an essential part of some card games.\nWhen the budget reaches $10,000, we'll add foil on all tuck boxes. \nSo, thanks for your attention to our project. Over the next 30 days we'll stay in contact with all the backers and hope this project will be funded. \nAll the elements shown could be changed and improved.

We printed 1,200 decks and our inventory officially sold out at the tail end of 2015. This led to many individuals requesting status on the next edition of Jetsetter Playing Cards and when it would take flight. So, we'd like to introduce you to the Premier Edition deck in the Altitude Blue colorway.\nWe took the concept of our original deck and decided to take it a few steps forward. The newest edition of Jetsetter Playing Cards is now further inspired by the classic casino and vintage airline decks of the past. We've added to the clean and simple design of the original while still appealing to aviation, travel, and playing card enthusiasts.\nTHE DECK\nThe tuck case will have a vintage and classy feel with modern appeal. Once in your hand, at the right angle, you'll notice a clear UV spot coating creatively applied as the pattern of airplanes found on the front of the tuck. Furthermore, it will be produced with exclusive synthetic stock providing durability beyond your standard tuck case that plagues your everyday deck - perfect for traveling. The back design of the playing cards will showcase the Altitude Blue colorway with the same airplane pattern as the original Luxury Edition deck. We've added our new Jetsetter Playing Cards logo to the back design in the traditional two-way casino-style. Additionally, the custom Ace of Spades will prominently exhibit that same new logo.\nTuck Box for the Premier Edition in Altitude Blue\nBack Design for the Premier Edition in Altitude Blue\nAce of Spades for the Premier Edition in Altitude Blue\nThe deck will be printed with standard court cards that have been re-colored to match the overall theme and feel of the Premier Edition deck in the Altitude Blue colorway, while paying homage to airline frequent flyer tiers. Spades and Clubs will showcase blue, black, and silver court cards. Diamonds and Hearts will showcase a deeper casino red, black, and gold court cards.\nRe-colored Spades for the Premier Edition in Altitude Blue\nRe-colored Diamonds for the Premier Edition in Altitude Blue\nThe deck will include two untraditional, yet functional Jokers that resemble a pair of fictitious airline boarding passes for a round trip flight. Each of the Jokers will show variation between the two, making them ideal for gameplay. Hidden within one of the Jokers will be an Eight of Clubs reveal. Additionally, as an added bonus for the traveling magician, both Jokers will have a location dedicated for a written prediction or signature.\nJokers for the Premier Edition in Altitude Blue\nLastly, the deck will be printed with the sought after Classic Finish, which provides a familiar and functional feel right out of the box.\nTHE MANUFACTURER\nThe thin borders of the Premier Edition deck relies on precise registration with the printing and cutting. Due to that critical requirement, we have selected The Expert Playing Card Company based in NYC to manage the production of the newest version of Jetsetter Playing Cards. However, we will be manufacturing this deck within the same factory as the Luxury Edition deck.\nTHE FIRST CLASS REWARDS\nSigned Deck with Display Case. Receive one (1) signed and numbered Premier Edition deck of Jetsetter Playing Cards. Each deck will be signed and individually numbered in silver (with the cellophane removed).

Designer playing cards with attitude.\nRemember us?\nThe Buzz:\nIn April 2015, over 500 people from all over the world contributed to the Kickstarting of the Joker and the Thief Playing Card Company. We released our debut deck - a completely custom, foil-covered deck of playing cards that oozed attitude. The design that you helped create was a hit, and is now loved by people around the world, all thanks to you! \nWe're extremely proud of the original deck and its general reception. It won a place on Kardify's Top 12 Decks of 2015! We were interviewed by ABC Local Radio Australia and the Local Newspaper. The original deck recently won third place in United Cardists' \"2015: Deck of the Year Contest\" for three categories - Best Ace of Spaces, Best Jokers and Best Tuck Box. The deck also landed a spot within the Top 100 Hot New Releases in Toys and Games on Amazon, as well as being featured on Art of Play, Cardvolution, and Gambler's Warehouse - three of the biggest playing card retailers on the planet. \nWe\u2019ve been absent for a while, but now we\u2019re back! The Joker and the Thief return with a striking and luxurious colour way \u2013 White and Gold.\nJoker and the Thief: White Gold Edition \nSharp. Streamline. Sublime\nTuck box photography by our friend Fabien Defaucheux. Check out his work on Instagram - @Fabiendefaucheux\n In collaboration with our artist Pedro Oyarbide, we originally sought to create a deck that was distinctly unique amongst other decks of playing cards on the market. We focussed on 100% custom illustration, striking details, eye-catching packaging and deep connotation evident through symbolic design. \nTo add to the mythology that the Joker and the Thief Playing Cards evoke, we decided to create a white and gold edition. This creates a third dimension of meaning, contrasting the darkness of the original deck with the light colour scheme of the second edition. This builds upon the conflict between life and mortality that is apparent on the back design. The Joker and the Thief emerge from the shadows more beautiful than ever.\nThe Back Design\nJoker and the Thief: White Gold Edition rocks a metallic gold, inverted colour scheme.\nA thought provoking dynamic of mysticism and myth.\nThe first step in creating the original cards was to create a unique back design. One that not only had an intricately beautiful design but one that both appealed aesthetically and sentimentally. It had to be thought provoking. From the first sketches to the end product, it slowly developed its own flair, and this continues throughout the deck! \nThe back design is one way; it is perhaps one of, if not, the most unobtrusive and functional major one-way design on a deck of cards.\nThis allows for a unique story and symbolism to be evoked; metaphors of life and mortality, thievery, lies, deceit, power, mysticism, struggle, and love. We see the opposition of the King and Joker, the way they oppose each other, each being attacked by a viper, a symbol that despite their contrast, both share the same fate. The chained hands, both of flesh and bone, represent mortality. They hold cards; life holds the ace of spades, the death card, and the skeletal holds a card with a skull on it, representing the inevitability of death. The chains and manacles link the Joker and the Thief, and the daggers represent the danger of their opposition.\nThe Joker and the Thief: White Gold Edition features an inverted back design sporting bright gold metallic ink for gorgeous shimmer in sunlight. \nThe Ace of Spades \nIconic. Draped in Gold.\nA bold statement. The ace of spades is the source of the original deck's identity.\nJoker and the Thief's debut Ace of Spades returns\nThe Court Cards\n12 Completely Custom Court Cards\nThe court cards are all completely custom, illustrated from scratch. The themes that you see on the back design can be seen here. You may even start to see a story forming as you shuffle through them. We have created something different. We have done away with borders to free the courts - to make use of the space and to make each of them distinct and prominent characters.\n\"12 court cards, dressed with charisma and distinct in character - royalty ready for battle.\" - Art of Play\nThe Joker and The Thief \nThe Two Troublemakers Return. \nThe Joker and The Thief\nThe Tuck Box \nPeppered with Lavish Touches.\nBy far the most praised aspect of the original deck of Joker and the Thief Playing Cards was the tuck box, which was adorned with a heavy amount of silver foil hot stamped on both the exterior and interior of the box. Now we have dressed the second edition in a beautiful white and gold colour scheme. \nWith gold foil stamping, embossing, a perforated blood red tax stamp seal now featuring gold foil, and a new uncoated matte finish for the white stock - this version is bound to stand out amongst your collection. Impress your friends with a deck that many are calling a conversation starter!\nThis tuck case will look amazing on your poker nights, pulling them out to perform to a spectator, residing on a shelf amonst your prized collection, or featured in an opening shot of one of your Cardistry Videos. \nBeautiful and extravagant tuck boxes are going to be a consistent feature of the Joker and the Thief brand moving into the future.\nInterior Hot Foil Stamping\nDesigned with Handling in Mind\nLightened and Improved. Taking full advantage of design and composition.\nAs a more refined version of the original deck, the White Gold edition had to be lightened, and stripped back. By inverting the back design, it not only created an elegant aesthetic, but it also significantly cuts the amount of ink saturation within the card stock. This takes full advantage of the composition of Classic Finish. By stripping back a significant amount of Joker and the Thief\u2019s ink, this deck should possess a far snappier; far more responsive and papery feel in comparison to the original deck. \nThe Bells and Whistles \nAll the features you want, know and love!\nThinner Borders\n100% Custom Pips, Fonts, Court Cards and Art Work\nUpdated Colour Scheme\nGold and Silver Metallic Inks (Faces and Backs)\nInterior Tuck Case Gold Foil Stamping \nExterior Tuck Case Embossing + Hot Stamped Gold Foil Coverage\nDramatic Ink Saturation Reduction \nCLASSIC Stock and Finish for Improved Handling\nMatte Finish Tuck Case Paper\nTraditionally Cut for Smooth Edges\nPerforated Blood Red Tax Stamp Style Seal now with Gold Foil\nManufacturing\nThe Expert Playing Card Company will manufacture the second edition of Joker and the Thief Playing Cards. This ensures that you receive the highest quality product possible, and a deck of playing cards that is both incredibly durable and handles amazingly. \nJoker and the Thief: White Gold Edition will sport the highly acclaimed CLASSIC Stock and Finish. To take full advantage of this type of stock and finish, this edition will feature a reduction of ink saturation due to its inverted back design. This, along with being traditionally cut, ensures snappier, smoother, crisper and more responsive cards for maximised performance.\nThis praised finish has both the snappiness and durability of EPCC's previous decks combined with the more papery feel and slick finish of a traditional USPCC deck. It is the best of both worlds.\nLEFT: Standard USPCC Cutting.

My name is James Milaras, and I am the co-founder and owner of the Joker and the Thief Playing Card Company. \nSecondly, we're very thankful here at Joker and the Thief for you guys, our backers! Last year, you made something very special happen. My best friend and business partner, Reuben, and I wanted to create a special deck of playing cards. Creating a deck of cards was our dream ever since we first got into cards. Our backers made that a reality! You will always be apart of team Joker and the Thief.\nReuben Nutt, while still collaborating with us has since moved town to pursue other interests. His continued efforts in creating beautiful video and photographic content for Joker and the Thief has been outstanding. Of course a shout out to our beast of an illustrative team member, Pedro Oyarbide, for his amazing work on this project as well as an upcoming monster of a project.\nWith that said there is even more cool stuff from us this year! Joker and the Thief: Dystopia is coming (*winks*). If you don't know who we are, here's a little something that will bring you up to speed with us!\nJoker and the Thief was founded by two Australian Cardists, videographers and photographers that have huge love for all things playing cards.\nBack in 2012, we started up a YouTube channel called Joker and the Thief Card Deck Reviews. Through this we collaborated with Art of Play. We got together on our weekends, and in our spare time to go out and location scout to shoot. We then edited in house, usually side by side, listening to music and fuelled by snacks. We had minimal equipment and a very small budget (if there really was one) Oh the joys of indie film making!\nWe sought to change the way deck reviews were made and in doing so, many adventures were had along the way. Since we didn't have a car at the time, our bikes and our legs were the main source of transport in our city, if we were to shoot on location. With little time, little transport, a budget of... not much, and our favourite Youtubers, Film Makers, and Cardists as our inspiration, we slowly but surely developed our skills. We had some truly memorable moments along the way. We always knew that we were going to create a deck of cards... one day. And here we are - Round 2! \nWe've done this once guys! We can do it again.

I am a Graphic Designer and Illustrator based in London, UK and I am happy to introduce my eccentrically drawn and colourful custom playing card deck V\u00edvido.\nI started this deck earlier this year with the idea of creating a bright, colourful and vivid deck that was fun to use. With the addition of some slightly eccentric fantasy court characters V\u00edvido playing card deck was born. Each court card is hand drawn and painted with a slight digital clean up for something unique and original. The deck features flamboyant and period themes such as masquerading, vanity, pomp and just plain strangeness!\nMy main goal when creating this playing card deck was to do something light hearted and fun but to also do something unique and vibrant.

You could say right off the bat that I had to overcome some major challenges wanting to design a deck of cards. Not only do you need an idea but you have to put a lot of time and effort into the whole process. When I first started I was not sure how I wanted my deck to look or what to call it. But it came together with the help of others in the card community and previous backers. I love how this deck turned out it looks better than I expected it to look in real life. I tried to get the designs on this deck to look hand drawn and came up with something new that looks very real. I really want you to enjoy it and so I have been hard at work again to make it better. I updated the pips and I made the indices smaller. I picked a different card company called Make Playing Cards because I can print the exact amount of decks I need and the cost is less. So if you have been here before thanks for coming back and if you are new to Unique Designs welcome and enjoy.\nPhoto Of The Actual Deck\nDeck Seal\nCosts Explained:\nI will be using Make Playing Cards to print the deck. I have all my artwork finished and it is ready to print. I need $3,500.00 to print and ship the decks and I don't have the resources to fund my dream printing this deck. $3,500.00 is for the printing, packaging, shipping and handling of the decks. I have been studying other card projects on KS and I have purchased a few as well. First I will be overseeing the shipping and I will be making sure that the cards are packaged well so that they arrive safely. Second the estimated delivery time is 4 months to print package and ship out the decks. I don't have a busy schedule so you can be sure that my time will be devoted to getting your orders out in a timely fashion. Please know that shipping International is expensive, but for this deck it is worth it.\n Limited edition Signed Deck.

That's why we moved away from traditional vector based mirrored cards and gave it more organic and playful look to it.\nThe deck features 56 cards, including an index card that lists the names of all the 54 puns in the deck. \nThe decks will be printed by the United States Playing Card Company, creators of the famous Bicycle deck of cards. These cards are known throughout the world for their remarkable decks and incredible craftsmanship.\n\nI\u2019m Alberto and together with my childhood friend Moo Hyun Chung, we launched a website 5 years ago called: \u201cDaily Critter\u201d. The idea was to illustrate a pun in the form of a fictional creature ( a critter ) every day, for the rest of our lives. Eventually, we realized that it was impossible for it to be daily, we tried for a while ( we have drawn more than 500 critter puns in the past 5 years ), but as you get older, life gets busier. Regardless, we stuck with the name and kept making \u201cOnce-in-a-while-critters\u201d. In 2014, Moo came to Korea, so we got together and decided that we should make a product out of Daily Critter. And that brings us to the Daily Critter playing cards, a deck of 54 illustrated critter puns currently being crowd-funded on Kickstarter. We wanted to elevate the quality of the illustrations and make a beautiful deck of cards completely drawn with water colors. But more than beautiful, we wanted to create something fun to play with by guessing the critter puns and also something you can keep playing with as a standard 52-card deck. We are really happy with how it turned out and we hope you are too!\n\n\nEXTRA STUFF: \nBECOME A CRITTER PUN!! \nFor 70$ we\u2019ll draw a watercolor pun illustration out of your name, using a photo of your face.

I want to pay homage to that history and create a deck of playing cards with art inspired by the tarot. \nIn some countries, traditional tarot cards aren't used just for divination, they're actually used for games the way we commonly use regular playing cards. Likewise, today's standard playing cards are used by some for divination\u2014known as cartomancy. The two card systems started out as the same thing and are still inextricably linked. This deck is the first I'm aware of that takes that simple fact as the inspiration for its design.\nThe Art, Suits, Symbolism, and the Rider-Waite\nThe art for this deck is heavily influenced by the 1910 Rider-Waite-Smith tarot deck\u2014its pretty much the standard for tarot cards used for divination. Though the style of my art is very different from Pamela Smith's art, the themes and intent will be very much in the spirit of her artwork with a healthy dose of my own intent and interpretation. \nArcana is first-and-foremost a playing card deck. Wherever possible I've pulled inspiration from the RWS Tarot, the Tarot of Marseilles, and the Sola Busca Tarot. That includes the royals, the suits, and the symbolism. That said, combining the two has meant a few tradeoffs.\nArcana isn't intended to be a full tarot deck. Playing cards printed through USPCC are 56 card decks (main cards plus 2 jokers, and 2 extra cards) while the tarot uses 78 cards. As a playing card deck, I'll be designing 56 cards, which means I have to limit the Major Arcana to 4 cards (replacing the two jokers and the 2 extra cards). The four cards I've chosen to include are The Tower, The Lovers, The Fool, and Death. I've consulted with a lot of tarot readers on this and they more or less agree that these cards are of importance to any reading and make sense to include. Additionally, these cards will not include the Page/Knave cards.\nCorrelating the suits was also a little dicey as there is at least a little healthy debate about which playing card suit goes with which tarot suit. I opted to go with what seemed like the most common concensus. Spades, Clubs, Hearts and Diamonds are paired up in this deck with Swords, Wands, Cups, and Pentacles respectively.\nAlso, just a note about my art. I take inspiration from all over\u2014art history, found images, my own sketches and photographs. I combine all of it to create something new. I create the final art by combining art from scratchboard and images I draw on my tablet. It's all hand drawn, and I'm meticulous about making sure the final imagery works at the relatively small scale of playing cards.\nThe Cards\nI hope you can tell from this artwork how much passion and dedication I have for the project. Each card takes many, many hours to draw, and I've been working on it for about a year. For me, the art is what custom playing cards are all about. If you backed one of my past projects, you know how detailed and unique my work is. It's a great pleasure to bring you these cards which I think takes my art to a whole new level. Please note that all images are just comps and subject to change.\nCard back light\nCard back dark\nJack of Clubs/Wands - light\nKing of Spades/Swords - light version\nJack of Spades/Swords light version\nAce of Hearts/Cups - dark version\nQueen of Hearts/Cups dark\n10 of Hearts/Cups dark\nAce of Spades/Swords light\nAce of Spades/Swords dark\n7 of Spades/Swords dark\nQueen of Diamonds/Pentacles\n5 of Clubs/Wands dark\nThe Tower - one of the 4 major arcana cards in this deck\nThe Lovers\nDeath\nJack of Hearts/Cups light\nKing of Hearts/Cups light\nKing of Diamonds/Pentacles - light\nMany of the other royals are in various stages of completion. My goal is to have all the artwork finalized by the end of the funding period. That's a tall order, so it's possible completing the art might stretch a bit past the funding period. I'll definitely be posting more card images as I create them, so be sure to check back and feel free to offer suggestions.\nThe Box\nAs you can tell, there will be 2 versions of Arcana, one light and the other dark. Here are some images of the box:\nText translates roughly to 'As above, so below'\nThe Prints\nNOTE: Prints can now be included as add-ons for $50/ ($58 Int.)\nAs with my past projects, I'm making prints available of of each royal design, the card back, box front, and the aces. My process is to create plates from the original card art. I ink the plates, then run them through my press on museum-grade artist paper:\nInking the printing plate\nLining it up on press\nThe finished hand-pulled print\nAn example of the detail in the prints\nThe finished print, signed and numbered. Please note that print rewards will not include the easel or board.\nI think there's something really rare and special about the artistry of hand-pulling editions. I'm thrilled to offer these gallery worthy prints for about the same as what others offer mass-produced silk screened prints or even less than Giclee prints (which are nice, but really they're just ink-jet prints with a fancy name). These hand-pulled prints are a unique chance to own a limited edition work of art.\nAll prints will be 12\" x 16\" on Stonehenge paper, with hand-torn deckled edges\u2014I personally tear down the paper myself to size. All prints will be 1 color, signed and numbered editions.\nPrints can be added on to your pledge for $50/($58 Int.)\nAdd Ons\nAdding any of the add on items below is pretty simple:\nFirst, choose a reward tier\nSecond, click on the \"Manage my pledge\" button, and add the amount of the add-on. \nThat's pretty much it. After the funding period, You'll be able to specify versions, sizes, etc.If you're an international backer, be sure to add the shipping amount if an add on has additional shipping costs (specified below).\nHardbound Illustrated Book - $28/$36 (Int.)SHIPS  DECEMBER 2015\nThis 6\" x 9\" black linen hardbound book with dust jacket will be illustrated with full page art for every major card (every card that has an illustration) and gives you a chance to learn more about what I wanted to accomplish with each illustration. It also will serve as a primer for those newer to tarot on how to read each card. It will contain approximately 150 \u2013 200 pages. \nPlease note that this is only a comp image and final art and layout is subject to change\nComp image of an interior layout. Minor cards (2s-10s) will likely be ganged 2-up on a page, all major illustrations will be full page art.\nMAJOR ARCANA Expansion Deck - $20/$25 (Int.)\nDeck with both light and dark versions of the Major Arcana tarot cards. This deck is for folks who want a complete tarot set and is in addition to the light and dark main cards. \nPLEASE NOTE THIS DECK WILL NOT SHIP UNTIL DECEMBER 2015\nMajor Arcana Expansion Deck\nTarot 2-piece Boxes - $5 each, int. shipping included\nShips December 2015\nDark version 2-part box (please note that no cards are included with the box and the design is subject to change\nLight version 2-part box (please note that no cards are included with the box and the design is subject to change\nAs promised, these premium finished boxes are being made available to you more-or-less at cost. These are 2mm thick cardboard boxes that will come in dark and light versions, will have metallic foil and spot UV varnish. These are 2-part boxes, meaning the top fits over the bottom and encloses the cards within. I did my best to mock these up, but please note the comps are for the general idea only and do not show the final design or premium finishes. These boxes are intended for folks who want to separate light and dark cards from the expansion deck and keep full tarot sets together.\nBlack Walnut and White Oak Inlay Wooden Tarot Box with Arcana Medallion - $45 / $55 Int.\nShips December 2015\nPlease note: The medallion in this image was comped, the box is a real prototype. Wooden box does not include cards.\nPlease note: Wooden box does not include cards.\nThis box is STUNNING in person, I hope the images do it justice! The white oak inlay really sets off the black walnut which has an at times reddish cast to it. This is sized to perfectly contain one full Tarot set (not included). This box can be used to protect and store complete tarot sets when used with the expansion deck. It features a swing hinge top piece that opens up to reveal the cards within. And, of course, it is topped off with an inset Arcana Silver-Finish Medallion.\n30\" x 30\" Black Silk Tarot Reading Cloth with Metallic Silver Imprint - $22 / $26 Int.\nSilk Tarot Reading Cloth. Please note design is subject to change slightly before being produced. Does not include wall or moulding, but shadows are included free of charge.\n I've found an amazing source for 100% silk tarot cloths. These beauties will be screen printed with metallic silver ink. They'll make an amazing setting for tarot readings!\nExtra decks - $11/$13(Int.)\nNo Extra deck limits, add on as many as you'd like.\nT-Shirts - $22/$32(Int.)\nPremium 4.2 oz. Available in S-XL (after the funding period you'll be able to select which version and size you'd like).\nArcana tree of life t-shirt\nArcana rota fortunae t-shirt\nArcana Uncut Sheets - $50/$75(Int.)\nUncut sheets are taken off the press as they're printed at the USPCC. They show every card in the deck, front and back. Each sheet will be signed and there is no limit to the number you may add-on. Each sheet is approximately 22\" x 26.5\"\nArcana Uncut sheets - dark and light versions\nAntique Silver Finish Coins\u2014$12, shipping included for domestic and international\nThese are the same heavy-duty, 10 gauge, half-dollar sized coins I had minted for my past projects, this time with an antique silver finish. They're a great weight (about the same as 5 quarters), super detailed and have a gorgeous finish. Other coins are molded, these are minted and that's a difference you can see and feel in the detail. Nothing beats a 100 tons of pressure making every detail pop. \nAntique finish coins - this is just a comp image and art is subject to change\nSolid Silver Proof Arcana Coin\u2014$55 (shipping included for domestic and international)\nOne troy ounce of .999 pure silver coin - note that this is just a mockup.\nOne of the advantages of having coins minted (as opposed to molded, don't get me started\u2026) is that I can mint them in solid precious metals. For the first time, I'm proud to offer a SOLID silver version of the Arcana coin. This coin isn't silver plated, it is one troy ounce of solid .999 pure silver. These are \"proof coins\" and will have with a mirror finish. Below is a comp (since they aren't minted yet), but should give you an idea of what it will look like and how it differs from the regular antique silver-finish coin (which is a great genuine metal minted coin, but is not solid silver, it's a brass alloy coin with a finish applied).\nPlease note that because of the nature of this reward, outside the US it is strictly \"buy at your own risk\". We will under no circumstances issue replacement coins if your postal carrier loses it, misplaces it, or you otherwise do not receive it. We lose tracking ability when most international shipments fly out through Chicago, but our responsibility for packages ends when ship to you in good faith. We've experienced some fraud in the past, and this type reward opens us up to a LOT of risk, so we are also limiting orders to 5 per backer. Also, within the US these coins will be sent separately from other rewards and the USPS will request your signature for you to receive the coins.\n It's hard to comp up the coins to show exactly what they look like, but here's a picture from a past project showing the detail when coins are minted:\nActual minted coins\n Stretch Goals\n50K - Iridescent pearl paper stock for tucks\u2014REACHED!\n55K - Designs/printing inside tucks\u2014REACHED!\n60K - Embossing + foil(s) on tucks\u2014REACHED!!\n65K - Major Arcana expansion deck\u2014REACHED!!!\n75K - Free print for EVERY PRINT BACKER\u2014REACHED!!!\n100K - Free gift for EVERY BACKER (over $11)\u2014REACHED!!! \n120K - The Illustrated Guide to Arcana hardbound book released. \u2014REACHED!!!\n150K stretch goal - LE deck sleeve for every every deck, Gilded Edition released\u2014REACHED!!! What? Yes!\nThis last stretch goal requires a little explanation. I want to do something very special that doesn\u2019t require backers to add anything on\u2014a true thank you from me to you for getting the project to this point. So if we reach this goal, I\u2019ll include a signed and numbered sleeve for every deck that won\u2019t interfere with you being able to open the cards up and use them. This will only be for backers\u2014only the KS decks will come with the LE sleeve. This will make every deck in the project extra valuable, since only KS backers will ever have them.\nThe Gilded Edition release will be a set of all three decks with a special leather bound book box I\u2019ll be hand binding myself (book binding is a one of my passions as you might have been able to tell from all the pictures with the cast-iron book press in this project). The decks will have edges gilded with palladium leaf. Palladium leaf is more expensive than silver leaf and has one major advantage. Palladium leaf does not tarnish, or oxidize, and maintains it\u2019s finish under the harshest of conditions. It\u2019s so stable in fact, that it\u2019s used for gilding in conditions where it will be exposed to outdoor elements. Personally I think it\u2019s more beautiful too, it has a slightly warmer tone than silver leaf. There will only be 25 (changed - now 45, also, will include everything at the $500 level too) of these very rare and special sets made available. Because these decks will be EXTREMELY labor intensive to produce, they will be a new reward tier and will cost $500. I know that sounds like a lot of money, and it is, but others sell genuinely gilded decks (not fake gilding using cheap foils) for upwards of $125 a piece. Hand gilding decks is an EXTREMELY labor intensive process requiring sanding multiple times at progressively finer grits, buffing to a glass-like finish, sizing the edges to receive the metal leaf, and then carefully applying the leaf. Truly these will be the ultimate collector\u2019s item. If we reach the 150K mark, I\u2019ll release the timing details of the Gilded Edition tier in advance (see Update) so everyone has a fair shot if interested in them. They will be first-come, first-serve.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is my third project so I feel like I've got a lot of experience.

Between commissions paid to Kickstarter, Amazon and Backerkit, manufacturing the cards and Add-On items and shipping them to Backers all over the world, expenses can mount quickly. So, we've raised our funding goal to a more realistic number.\n\nWe've also learned how important it is to stay engaged with our Backers, answering their questions and listening to their feedback so a project can reach its potential. For Dia de los Muertos, we took notes from a few Backers that definitely improved the overall design. This campaign will be no different - we're going to stay active on the message boards and provide regular updates. And we want to hear from not just card collectors but hopefully hardcore RPG-ers as well, so that we can make these decks enjoyable for everyone.\n\nWe've also decided to keep our pledge tiers simple. Of course, Backers are still free to add to their pledges by purchasing as many Add Ons as they like - we just don't want the tiers becoming too complicated as that tends to complicate shipping, which slows things down. Faster shipping, happier Backers. Which brings us to...\n\n...fulfillment. This is easily the most challenging aspect of a successful campaign. No matter how on schedule Creators are, the vendors' schedules are a different story. With Dia de los Muertos, we encountered delays from different manufacturers that were beyond our control. So, we've decided to be even more conservative this time and plan on completing fulfillment for this project in April. There is every chance we could fulfill earlier than that, but it's more realistic to plan on delays.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Edgy Brothers\n12 created \u00b7 50 backed\nEdgy Brothers is a design company based in Los Angeles, Ca. and Austin, Tx.

As you can guess, the pants were a huge hit for their comfort, ornate designs, and the resulting superhero feeling you'll experience while wearing them.  \nAfter seeing the positive responses, Nathan decided to pursue something larger and began locking down elephant pants suppliers. With a supplier lined up and styles selected, Nathan enlisted the help of his business partner James and together they began forming the foundation of the brand, The Elephant Pants. The Elephant Pants bring you adventurous and stylish comfort that can accompany you on your daily journey. Wear them around the house, while running errands, on your way to yoga class, or out to the movies with friends.  \nNow The Elephant Pants needs your help to bring these amazing pants State-side. With our goal set at $5,000, we will be able to bring six styles of elephant pants into the mix. As a \"thank you\" for being an early-adopter, we will be covering the shipping costs on all U.S. pledges being shipped out. Help us by pledging and declare victory for your legs.\nSay No Campaign\nFor every pair sold we are donating $1 to the African Wildlife Foundation and their Say No Campaign. This campaign has been created to help bring an end to Elephant Poaching. In 2012 alone there were more then 35,000 Elephants poached for their tusks.\n Help us save some Elephants and get stylish in the process!\nThe Pants\nThe most comfortable and uplifting pants you'll ever own. The Elephant Pants are guaranteed to put a smile on your face and those around you. Our styles are authentic Thai designs coming in an array of designs and colors. The pants are made from 100% cotton. They are one-size-fits all with an elastic band on the waist and legs. Pockets are conveniently located on both sides and can easily fit a cellphone, wallet, or pair of sunglasses. \nThe Styles\nWe are starting with six styles and bringing them here to the States. Each $18 pledge is for a particular style, so be sure you are pledging for the style you want! Scroll down to see the first six styles and declare victory for your legs #legvictory.\nBlack Diamond\n Raja\n Tarra\n Chunee\n Batyr\nRuby\nReward Packs\nThank you for your help!

She studies nature, including birds, and from her efforts has come an absolutely stunningly elegant natural bird deck. Karina is an illustrator and fine-artist, born in Leningrad, USSR (St. Petersburg, Russia), and is currently based in Vienna, Austria.\nArtist Karina Eibatova\nKarina specializes in drawing, illustration, murals, video, calligraphy and typography. She has had exhibitions in St. Petersburg and Moscow, Russia, Gerlesborg, Sweden, and Vienna, Austria. She is 1 of 3 people in a creative artist group called the Dopludo Collective.\nSome of her other clients include: Sunday New York Times (USA), Wired Magazine (England), Iloveyou Magazine (Berlin, Germany), Monsterthreads (Sydney, Australia), and Atlantic Records (USA). She recently completed painting a mural inside a luxury hotel in Barcelona, Spain.\nBicycle AVES Deck Playing Card Features: \nPrinted by The United States Playing Card Company\nBicycle\u00ae branded\nHand drawn and designed by artist Karina Eibatova\nDeck produced by LUX Playing Cards\n100% completely custom designed cards, including art, pips, royalty, backs, everything.\nCustom Tuck Case with textured linen cover\n56 cards including a full 52 card deck, plus 2 Jokers, a LUX card, and a double backed card.\nNormal sized poker deck of playing cards.\nLinen finish. Also known as Air-Cushion finish for fine handling.\nPrinted on premium Bicycle card stock.\nArtwork inspired by birds of nature.\nThe tuck cases are amazing. We wanted the cards to be held in something as stunning as the cards themselves, so we are using a unique textured, linen cover for the tuck case, which reminds me a lot of the lines and hatch work on the Madison Rounders / Dealers tuck cases. The raised texture on this tuck goes really well with the theme of the deck.\n The nests in the corners are part of the 2 small side flaps that fold down under the initial opening. Each part of the tuck case is being used to show off the art.\nThe card back is extremely detailed, and features feathers from many bird types tied together with a beautiful, one of a kind coordination. The cards fan really well with this colorful, elaborate design. Even with a large picture, the intricate designs are amazing.\nThere is amazing attention to detail on each different royalty card, all of which are illustrated by hand.\nThe level of sophistication on the illustrations is incredible. You won\u2019t know whether to play with them or hang them on your wall.\nThis Bicycle playing card deck will feature 56 cards, including a full 52 card deck with 2 Jokers, a LUX ad card, and a double-backed card, all carried in a unique textured linen finished tuck box.\nThe United States Playing Card Company has already approved the artwork, so this deck is ready to fly into your hands.\nThe Aces are striking. You\u2019ll see they still carry the Bird theme while retaining a unique individuality.\nThis is my second playing card deck to produce, and the first one successfully funded here on Kickstarter. We waited to launch this deck until the first playing cards - The Illusionist Deck - had shipped.\nThank you for helping to make this deck of playing cards a reality. Please share this project on Facebook and Twitter so that others can share in this beautiful art.\nPips - 4 of a kind.\n Below are a few pictures of the hand-made LUX leather playing card holders. They each hold one deck of cards, as seen in the photos. There are only a total of 12 of these: 6 red and 6 chocolate brown, so when they're gone, they're gone!\n Special anodized aluminum card cases are also available as an add-on. You can simply add $9 to your existing pledge, and you can choose either the black or gold versions. They are light-weight and will protect your cards from almost anything. Only 100 total of the special anodized aluminum card cases were made of each color.\n Wooden Coins\nInstead of a metal coin for this project, we wanted to do something more in touch with this playing card deck, so we are going with custom engraved wooden coins. These 2 inch diameter wooden coins are absolutely amazing in their detail. Each wooden collector\u2019s coin is laser engraved for the highest possible resolution.\nWooden Coins Set of 5 Complete\nI\u2019ve even added the tip of a pencil to a picture to show you just how detailed the engraving is on these wooden collector\u2019s pieces, which can also be used as a dealer coin when playing poker or card night.\n  The coins come in a set of 5: the Swan pictured here (Queen of Spades), as well as the Peacock (Jack of Hearts), Penguin (King of Clubs), Owl (King of Hearts), and Pelican (Queen of Diamonds). You would simply add $30 on to your base pledge to have us ship this 5 collector coin set to you. The back of the coins are represented by the 4 different card suits in their own unique Bird designs, plus a coin made up of 2 feathers represented on the tuck case and card back design.\nOriginal Art, 1 of a kind. Signed by artist.\nThe original art would look great in a 5 inch by 7 inch frame. The suit designs (Diamond Feather, etc) are smaller by nature than the birds, but are still amazing in their detail.\nPelican and Diamond Feather with Ruler\nUncut Sheets are available as an add-on. An uncut sheet is approximately 26 inches by 22 inches, and it is the printed sheet of cards that is pulled from the rack before it was cut into a deck of cards. It is a great display piece. One side has the card backs while the other side has the front (faces) of all of the cards.\nArt prints of any bird design are also available as an add-on. Art prints are 14 x 22 inches, and finished on a linen stock, so they'll look amazing. Make sure you get one of these amazing fine art prints for yourself or for a friend.\nTo manage your pledge, just add-on an additional dollar amount to your base pledge if you want Add-on items from below. You will receive a survey at the end of this campaign so that you can detail what your pledge was for, and you will receive any extra items that you want (wooden coins, extra card decks, uncut sheets, art prints, card deck holders, etc.) Thank you!\nAdd-Ons\nBicycle branded playing cards have the Bicycle logo across the front of the deck, as in the pictures above.

They continue to fight for their rights to the land on Easter Island which was taken away from them during the centuries of raids, a foreign company takeover of the Island and 1888 annexation by Chile. This project pays homage to RongoRongo scribes who created those amazing glyphs.\nBLACK DECK\n RongoRongo BLACK Deck / Back\nRongoRongo BLACK Deck / Queen of Hearts\nGILDED DECK\n RongoRongo GILDED Deck / Back\nRongoRongo GILDED Deck / Queen of Hearts\nGOLD DECK\n RongoRongo GOLD Deck / Back\n RongoRongo GOLD Deck / Queen of Hearts\nAnimated RongoRongo GOLD back.

The Chumash people often played two styles of games, one involving chance, and the other skill. The ancestors of the Chumash often would even place bets on the outcomes of these games as well.\nEach village had a special area in which these games were played, they called it Malamtepupi. With this in mind we have shortened the name to Malam, and merged it with one of the most notorious items used in the current age of gaming and created Malam Playing Cards.\nThe Gold Foil Box.\nBack Design, Ace of Spade and Joker.\nWe used extreme detail on the faces of the cards, creating gorgeous court cards and beautiful pips to create a deck you would be proud to own. The backs of the cards we took a simple approach while still maintaing some of the detail, using a tomahawk and building around it. \nSpades Sample\nThen there are the Aces..Many people raved about the Aces on our Believe Playing Cards, so we carried that over into this deck, creating another extremely detailed set of Aces. Using inspiration from such items as dream catchers and tomahawks, we put together what we believe to be our best set of Aces yet. \nDiamonds Sample\nAll of this with our custom Feather pips, created a true piece of artwork you can carry in your pocket at all times. \nWe are honored to bring you Malam Playing Cards!\nHearts Sample\nClubs Sample\nTWO DECKS? \nWe made two versions of this deck..One being the Deluxe Edition, the other is what we call the Standard Edition. \nDeluxe Edition:\nThe Deluxe Edition comes with all the bells and whistles, custom court cards, custom pips, custom aces and in a beautiful box, with gold foil printing and embossing. \nThe Deluxe also come with a Custom Seal. \nDeck Seal for Deluxe\nStandard Edition:\nThe Standard edition keeps the deck simple for those who may want to use the cards for such things as Magic, and not draw to much attention to the design. This version includes The Box, with with gold foil printing and embossing, the custom Ace of Spades and the custom Court Cards. All the number cards have standard pips.

Peter has drawn decks for many different companies over the years including not only Newt's Playing Cards, but also US Games and Piatnik.  Just shy of 20 have been published and another 30+ have been created as part of or one offs for various collectors worldwide.  We are proud to continue the legacy with this unique, Limited Edition deck of cards that includes your normal 52 cards plus 4 jokers...all drawn by Peter Wood.\nThis Kickstarter campaign features a LIMITED EDITION, numbered deck of cards that takes you on a journey that is reminiscent of comic book heroes of the past.\nCan you find all the hearts?\nHere are a few words from Peter Wood:\n-- WHAT MAKES THIS DECK DIFFERENT  --\n-  Strict Limited Edition run of 1152 decks of cards or 8 cases.\n-  Numbered Edition, Gold Colored Decal or label on each deck.\n-  Printed design inside of the tuck box.\n-  Decks will sell for $12 plus shipping after shipment arrives.\n-  Uncut sheets will ONLY be available here on Kickstarter.\n-  If we print a \"normal\", retail deck it will not include bonus jokers, labels or foil back (if stretch goal is met).\nLimited Edition Label/Decal\n-- WHAT IS SEMI-TRANSFORMATIONAL ART --\nThis type of art isn't really new as it has been around since the late 1800s.  As the video states multiple times, at NewtsGames.com we just happen to love this type of art so much that we continue to create more decks with it.  In the \"old days\" this type of art was called \"semi-transformational\" but we like to call it \"hidden images\" or \"seek-n-find\".  \"Semi-transformation\" just means that the suit signs or \"pips\" are hidden in the picture...which is exactly what these decks do.  They are 'transformed' in a subtle and fun way just like they did back in the late 1800s.\nCan you find the hidden clubs?\n-- THE STORY BEHIND THE DECK --\n\"NEWTROPOLIS & The Fantastic Fur\" Is the latest deck of cards created by UK artist Peter Wood exclusively for Newt's Playing Cards!  Peter has always been a huge fan of comic book superheroes and remembers reading them as a young boy a 'few' years ago.  Likewise, he loves to draw teddy bears.  Together, this deck features Peter's \"Super Teddy Bears\", straight from his own imagination.  While he freely admits that some are parodies of famous comic book heroes and villains, most are inspired from every day life.\nSimilar to some of our other decks like \"WILD!\", \"Cats - Pips-N-Paws\" and \"Busy Bears\", Peter has created \"NEWTROPOLIS & The Fantastic Fur\" in the same semi-transformational format. At Newt's Playing Cards we often call them \"seek and find\" playing cards to help folks better understand what the deck is.  The basic scoop is the deck has hidden Pips (hearts, clubs, diamonds and spades) on each card.  As an added dimension Peter has also hidden the symbol of Newtropolis, a hexagon, throughout the deck.\nCan you find the hidden diamonds?\n-- WHAT IS NEWTROPOLIS? --\nNEWTROPOLIS is the main city of Hugobia (The Land Of Bears).  What makes this city so unique is not the buildings or it's location, but many of it's inhabitants. NEWTROPOLIS is the home of a host of powerful and very special teddy bears who have a vast range of special powers. Some are gained from unique circumstances, some from accidents and some from years of dedication to their craft. These 'Super' bears are joined by their desire to rid Hugobia of all evil and wrong.  They are divided into 3 main 'factions': The Diamonds, Hearts & Clubs.  They are all connected in their battle with evil via BRAIN (Ace of Clubs) who has the mental ability to contact anyone at any time and read their minds whilst planting his own thoughts within his subjects heads. All is not well in NEWTROPOLIS! Although the 'good' bears in Hugobia derive much of their energy from the honey combs pure honey, there is a mutant strain of this food that was infected many years ago - some say deliberately. For those bears that eat from this source it eats away at their more positive traits and has created the villain 'Spades', which are the sworn enemies of NEWTROPOLIS.  They also have a wide range of bears with special powers of their own.\nAnd so the battle for NEWTROPOLIS begins. Heroes versus Villains.  Good versus evil.  One lovable hug at a time...but who will win?\nOh, and you better watch out for the \"Joker\" bears.  Who knows what side they align with!\nCan you find all the pips on the Jokers?\n -- ABOUT THE CARDS --\nThe decks will be printed by one of our regular manufacturers in China.  The quality of the deck is very important to us.  Over the years we have worked with various suppliers in other countries and the couple that we use now provide the best service and excellent quality products.\nHere are basic details of the decks:\n- 300 gsm (10pt) stock\n- Block out core to make sure cards can't be seen through\n- 56 cards per deck (52 Normal, 4 Jokers/Wild Cards)\n- Poker Size (2-1/2 x 3-1/2)\n- Matte, Linen Finish\n- 4 color front, 4 color back, 4 color tuck box - 300gsm (10 pt stock)\n- Shrink wrap around tuck box\n- Print INSIDE of tuck box.\n-  INCLUDES LIMITED EDITION DECK SEALS or numbered labels on all of the decks!\nCan you find all the spades?\n -- OTHER DECKS BY NEWT'S & PETER WOOD? --\nNewt's has been publishing decks of cards for almost 15 years now.  Usually small \"Indie\" style runs.  While we have done quite a few decks with this semi-transformational style art.  We have also published political cards, other forms of art and historical decks.  As collectors we ended up taking our passion for collecting playing cards to a much larger scale and it has been a blast.\nOther decks of cards drawn by Peter Wood and published by Newt's Games & Puzzles.\nShown above you can see some of the other decks we have published with artwork done by Peter Wood.  There are actually a couple of \"rewards\" you can get to help fund this new deck and get some of the others too.  It's a great way to add to your collection.  One of the reward levels is for the last 12 known decks of the \"Chamber of 52 Cards\" which is a limited edition deck of 500 decks worldwide.  Before we launched our first KS campaign there were more of these, but now we are down to only these 12 because quite a few sold on our site.\n  -- CARD BACK DESIGN --\nKeeping with the tradition of \"hidden pips\", our card back features a honey comb design with various flourishes and the \"leaders\" of the Good and the Evil bears.\nCard Back Design for NEWTROPOLIS & The Fantastic Fur\n We've just enhanced the \"HONEY COLLECTORS 12 PACK\"!  Now it not only includes some of the limited items we have on some of Peter's artwork, but there will ONLY be 5 of them available.  Basically because that is all of the uncut sheets we have of Genesis and Pips and Paws.  So far we have not found uncuts of any of the other decks.\nVERY Limited Quantities!\nSo if you want to collect pretty much everything we have from Peter Wood, then this new level is for you.  We are even going to get Peter to sign the others decks we've printed!  So you'll not only get a signed copy of NEWTROPOLIS, but also of WILD!, Pips and Paws and Busy Bears.  We will leave it up to you if you want us to open the Genesis deck and have it signed or not.  The uncut sheets in this reward level will NOT be signed.\n~~  S T R E T C H    G O A L S ~~\n1) Reach $2,500 = The FIRST 50 Backers whose pledge is $40 or more will get a FREE deck of Peter Wood's other deck of teddy bear playing cards called, BUSY BEARS.\n2) Reach $3,500 = The black areas on card back will be printed with FOIL.  This is similar to what you see on various collectible card games but instead we will do it on the card back and they are playing cards.\n3) Reach $5,000 = We will make a standard retail edition available.  A minimum of 1,000 decks from the run of the retail deck will be donated to hospitals to be given out to children who are diagnosed with diabetes.  No foil back, no printing inside tuck box.

It was the first rail line that connected the east to the west and revolutionized transportation and commerce in a post Civil War United States. A Golden Spike was created as a commemorative piece to celebrate the completion of the 1st transcontinental railroad and was driven into the ground where the Union Pacific met the Central Pacific Railroad at Promontory Point, Utah. When the hammer rang out and the golden spike was driven into the ground, a new era of industry and expansion rang out across the United States.\nEach playing card deck has been illustrated using a cross hatch technique to mimic the style of engraving and lithographs that were common to the time period.

This increases variety and value!\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nI grew up in Los Angeles and at a very young age, I was exposed to a lot of different cultures, especially that of the Mexican heritage. There are many aspects of the culture that I become accustomed to, but it wasn\u2019t until I started looking into my fear of death that I was introduced to the holiday known as Dia De Los Muertos. The imagery and symbolism of Dia De Los Muertos is incredibly beautiful and has a lot of whimsy and playfulness to it despite it involving the very somber topic of death.\nMy goal when creating the imagery for the Muertos deck is to honor the message that Dia De Los Muertos celebrates. From Aztec influences to Jos\u00e9 Posada\u2019s works and even the Mexican-American Wars, I aimed to capture the social classes and implications that are set within the history of the culture. By encompassing all of it and expressing it in my style and my background, I feel it\u2019s true to me and a product I am very proud of.\nIn the next couple of weeks, I hope to get work with you to release more awesome rewards and make Muertos come to life together!\nMuertos Night Deck back design\nMuertos Night Deck Aces\nMuertos Night Deck Spade Face Cards - (Left to Right) El Padre, La Hermana, El Soldado\nMuertos Night Deck Hearts Face Cards - (Left to Right) El Catrin, La Viuda, El Bandito\nMuertos Night Deck Clubs Face Cards - (Left to Right) El Caudillo, La Bailarina, El Campesino\nMuertos Night Deck Diamonds Face Cards - (Left to Right) El Azteca, La Catrina, El Caballero\nJoker cards feature the Calaveras (sugar skull) and the Muertos Insignia.\nThe pips on numbered cards has been updated to a design that reflects the symmetry of traditional decks but is new and refreshing. \nMuertos Queen of Clubs - La Bailarina\nMuertos King of Diamonds - El Azteca\nMuertos Tuck Box Layout and Layers\n\nThe Muertos Night Deck come packaged in a black and grey embossed box featuring gold foil accents, and a grey tax stamp seal.\nMuertos tuck box grey seal\nOnce $40,000 Stretch goal funding is reached, the limited Muertos: Mourning Gold Edition will be unlocked as an add-on.\n\nOnce $60,000 Stretch goal funding is reached 1 additional Mourning Gold Edition deck will be free for all backers with 3 Night Decks or More!

Thank you for stopping to look at our project! We are Peter Dunham and Linnea Gits, the designers and artists behind the Chicago design studio, Uusi and we are excited to introduce our project to you: an entirely hand-drawn deck of Limited Edition Playing Cards called \"Hotcakes.\"\n  \"Hotcakes\" is the fifth deck in our eventual six-deck series that began a little over two years ago. With every deck we have created for our series we try to push the boundaries of what this genre has seen. No two are the same in style, medium or theme, but all are created using traditional artistic methods. Whether using the Fine Art medium of oil paint as we did with our Pagan deck, or the expressionistic, colorful washes of gouache that gave Bohemia its signature look or, rubbing soft pastels over color pencil to add a velvety look and texture to our first deck Blue Bloods, our goal is always to create a unique style and theme for each deck.  With \"Hotcakes\" we reached for the most spontaneous medium in our art tool bag \u2013 markers! \nFollowing in the historic, playing card tradition, our Ace of Spades is always the title card for our decks.  With Hotcakes we wanted to give it the same saucy attitude of the court and felt nothing could be more fitting than two naughty cherubs!\nTrue Hotcakes Fools! Our courting Cock and his bashful Hen add just the right amount of old-fashioned, \"awe-shucks\" charm to this racy little deck.\nOur Diptych Ad Cards are unique to Uusi. We were the first designers to develop a diptych for playing cards and used it for the first time on our \"Royal Optik\" deck. The diptych was originally inspired by cards of transformation decks, that when pieced together form a larger image. We feel they add an original, artistic flair to what otherwise would have become a throw-away set of cards in the deck and bring the perfect last touch to the uncut sheets.  \nNothing but a borderless, lacy back would be right for Hotcakes! The \"tighty-whitey\" borders have been thrown off for a full-pattern reveal. The hot-neon magenta design makes for an eye-popping fan and a flush of excitement on every deal.\nOoh la, la! Our Hotcakes tuck is royally good fun.  A hand colored bustier barely covers this buxom nobel's treasured assets and is printed on luxurious, uncoated, premium paper stock. The design is unzipped in the back adding the perfect, naughty hint at what's inside. \nOur Limited Edition, Hotcakes \"Modesty Sleeve\" keeps all this cheekiness discreetly hidden with the beautiful Hotcakes back pattern printed on very heavy paper stock\u2013 the perfect cover to protect and hide a deck of misbehaving royals! These LE cases and decks will not be cello wrapped, they will be vellum wrapped together with a special, Hotcakes seal.\nNEW UPDATE: BY POPULAR DEMAND MODESTY SLEEVE AVAILABLE AS AN ADD-ON! FOR THE SLEEVE ONLY (BLACK OR RED) ADD $12 TO YOUR PLEDGE. \n Vellum Wrap and Oversize Seals for Hotcakes Modesty Sleeve Decks\n*All images of the deck and tuck boxes you see in these photos are prototypes made at Uusi's studio. The finished product may vary slightly from what you see here \u2013 backers will be kept up-to-date of any minor changes that may occur. The overall design and theme will remain UNCHANGED throughout the funding and printing process. \n Our inspiration for Hotcakes came from traditional 17th Century, full figure court cards that have a cartoonish flair and lent themselves easily to a burlesque-style exaggeration. This new and \"naughty\" court was then mixed with the Pop Art era's hot-neon colors, Andy Warhol's playful illustration style, the one-off art decks of Charles Pry and the distinctive quailty of the Italian designer & artist, Emillio Pucci's gorgeous patterns to arrive with the final look of Hotcakes.  \nUsing a one-way court does make Hotcakes more of an \"art deck\" for us than all our other decks, but we were very careful to keep the deck as playable as we could. We made sure \u2013 as always \u2013 that our indices are large and easy to read when held in your hand, as are the small suit symbols below them. As product designers, creating a deck of playing cards always means keeping a very strong emphasis on the \"playing\" \u2013 we want you to have a deck that is not only pleasing to look at, but one that you can enjoy and share playing any of your favorite games with your family and friends. \nFifty-two playing cards and two jokers \u2013 all with original, eye-catching artwork that makes them ideal for magic and card games, yet at the same time very familiar and immediately recognizable by players and spectators alike.\nTwo illustrated Uusi Ad Cards that form a diptych. \nPrinted by the United States Playing Card Company (USPCC). *All our artwork has already been pre-approved and is ready for print.\nLimited Edition of 5000 Black decks. \nPrinted on Bicycle Playing Card Stock with an Air Cushion (linen) finish.\nHeavy, premium paper for the tucks and a bit heavier paper for the sleeve.\nEach deck we create is a labor of love. We put an enormous amount of time into designing these unique decks and rewards as we truly want you to have something of value to enjoy for years to come \u2013 as will we! The Kickstarter experience has introduced us to people from all over the world, like yourself, who share the same passion we do for this humble item. You have enriched our work and our lives with your generosity, your own stories and invaluably helpful suggestions. \nWe have been producing Limited Edition decks for over two years now and with each one we maintain a high level of artistry and continue to raise the quality of the overall product.

We truly love creating these decks and are grateful to a community of backers who have supported us and allowed this series to come into the world.

I decided to combine my skills as a graphic artist with my love of playing cards and when I finally stumbled across Kickstarter, everything fell into place. \nMy wife and I had a great time with the entire process of creating and distributing Radical 80's Playing Cards (californiaplayingcards.com). We enjoyed interacting with Kickstarter, working with the USPCC and getting to know the playing card community. We enjoyed it so much in fact, we're back for more. \nWe are excited to present Rock 'N' Roll playing cards through Kickstarter.  With your help, Rock 'N' Roll Playing Cards will become more than just a dream on my hard drive. By backing this project, you will help create the hardest rocking deck of playing cards in Bicycle's 129 year history. \nThank you for being part of this project. For those about to pledge for Rock 'N' Roll Playing Cards; we salute you!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is my second Kickstarter playing card deck.

We'll relaunch in a few months, so keep an eye on our site (www.vixentorgames.com) for info on joining the Facebook page or Twitter. More details will be coming as we have them!\nStart with the Old West. Then add a little bite to it. Skeleton cowboys and barbed wire. Guns and dynamite. And a bullwhip.\nThe Plugged Nickel Playing Cards are a limited-print, specialty deck of cards printed by the United States Playing Card Company, so you know you're getting the same quality and finish you expect from the company that creates the world-famous Bicycle playing cards. There will be no second printing - once these decks are gone, they're gone for good.\nPlugged Nickel Playing Cards - Rusted Tin Tuck Box\nPlugged Nickel Playing Cards - Wanted Poster Tuck Box\n  Dead Man's Hand - Wanted Poster\nDead Man's Hand - Rusted Tin\nThe highlights of the Plugged Nickel Playing Cards are the face cards. Each was specifically designed to resemble its traditional counterpart, from the angle of the head and pose of the body to the shapes found in the body of the card itself. The barbed wire, of course, is new.\nWanted Poster Clubs\nRusted Tin Clubs\nWanted Poster Diamonds\nRusted Tin Diamonds\nWanted Poster Spades\nRusted Tin Spades\nWanted Poster Hearts\nRusted Tin Hearts\n That does it for the courts, but I still have a few aces up my sleeve. Literally, aces. Not literally my sleeve, though. Next time I update here, I'll show off the aces, and before too much longer, we'll get to the jokers and the ad card.\nI'm particularly excited about the ad card.\nThe piece de resistance, the feather in the cap of this Kickstarter, is the extremely limited card box. This wooden box is made of South American walnut that grows in an area prone to lightning strikes. The wood gets these cool black streaks from all the electricity being pulled up out of the ground.\nThe lid of the card box boasts the Plugged Nickel Playing Cards logo, carved right into the wood. This picture shows the lid and showcases the gorgeous burn marks that the lightning has made into the wood.\nCard Box - Closed\nThe inside tray of the box is carved from a single piece of walnut, and has space to hold two decks, six dice and the dealer's coin. Here's a shot of the box with the lid up. The dice are just standard dice for now, but they will be the Plugged Nickel specialty dice in the finished product.\nCard Box - Open\nThe card boxes are extremely limited. Only five will be available, and when they're gone, they're gone. These boxes will not be available after the Kickstarter ends. The boxes go for $150 each, and will come fully stocked with two decks of cards, a dealer's coin and six dice. These are not technically add-ons - they are available at the highest pledge level.\nWhile the focus here is on printing the Plugged Nickel Playing Cards, and making them as great as they can be, we do have a few cool extras for you to add to your pledge.\nThere are three options for art prints. The first two are the card back and the Ace of Spades, from either the Rusted Tin or Wanted Poster deck, each available as a 20 X 30 giclee print. These are high-quality art prints, signed and numbered, printed on bright white archival paper. Each is available by adding $40 to your pledge.\nCard Back Prints - 20 x 30\nAce of Spades Prints - 20 x 30\nThe third art print option is for a set of four 8 X 10 prints, this time of the four kings. These lords of cowboy poker will be proud to decorate your game room or office, whether you prefer the Wanted Poster look or the Rusted Tin. Like each of the art prints, these are high-quality giclee prints, signed and numbered, on bright white archival paper. You can add a set of the kings by adding $40 to your pledge.\nKings Prints - set of four 8 x 10\nPersonally, I can't wait to be holding an uncut sheet of the Plugged Nickel Playing Cards. There are two decks, so there are two sheets available. Each is available by adding $40 to your pledge ($80 for both of them).\nPlugged Nickel Uncut Sheets\nWe've also got a few great bits for poker fans. First up is the dealer's coin. This is a heavy, 1.5\" coin, 4mm thick. Obviously, the image below is an artist's rendering; the real coin will look even cooler. You can grab up one of these great coins by adding $10 to your pledge.\nPlugged Nickel Dealer's Coin\nSome custom dice will go nicely with your custom cards. These are engraved dice, bone-colored, with the insets painted black. Again, this is just a mockup. A pair of dice can be yours by adding $6 to your pledge.\nPlugged Nickel Dice\nThe dice will be made by Dice Empire. They make a whole bunch of cool custom dice - you can see them here:\nDICE EMPIRE\nWe will be using Backerkit to sort out the add-ons when the project is finished. Once the project closes, we will send out Backerkit surveys so you can tell us exactly what you want.\nI don't just want to print a couple decks of cards. I want to print two of the coolest decks ever seen. I need $25,000 to cover postage and printing; everything after that will go to making the Plugged Nickel Playing Cards even more awesome.\nThe first improvement to the Plugged Nickel Playing Cards is a pretty obvious touch - at $30,000, we'll have custom seals on every deck.\nThe next upgrade after the custom seal will be to add embossing to the tuck box. This will make the design pop out, and give the deck a great tactile feel. We'll do that at $35,000.\nOnce the embossing is in the bag, I want to add copper metallic ink to highlight the art on the tucks. When we get to $40,000, both tuck boxes will get metallic ink.\nArt on the inside of the tuck box is a really cool touch that you don't see with every deck. That will happen at $45,000.\nTo make the Plugged Nickel Playing Cards feel authentic, I want to use upgraded stock on the tuck box that will give it a rougher, more natural feel. We'll see that upgrade at $50,000.\nThe art card in the Plugged Nickel Playing Cards looks awesome - cool enough to hang on the wall. So when we hit $50K, every backer who is getting a deck of cards will get a postcard-sized version. And yeah, I'll sign every one of them.\nI've got more ideas for interesting stretch goals, but let's not put the cart before the horse, shall we? When we get close to $55,000, I'll add some more stuff I would love to see happen with these decks.\nThe Plugged Nickel Playing Cards started out as just a creative impulse - I thought it would be fun to design a deck of cards. And it was. But after I designed a deck of cards, I wanted to play poker with them, and figured other people might want them, too. That means getting them printed, and the US Playing Card Company will make them look and feel great.\nAs I was adding color to the hand-drawn designs, I ended up with two very different looks. The problem was, I couldn't decide which I liked more. So I went with both. The decks share the same line art, but the similarity ends there.\nThe Wanted Poster deck is the closest in appearance to a traditional deck of cards, with colorful court cards and a relatively neutral background. I wanted it to look like, well, a wanted poster, so I went with sort of weathered paper texture.\nThe Rusted Tin deck is more of a departure from the everyday. The background resembles rusted metal, and every card has a red or dark brown background, depending on its suit. The face card art and pips are burned into the background, but with enough contrast to still stand out.\nI also wanted cool pips, and since I was already doing barbed wire everywhere else, I thought, what the heck, let's go for broke. The pips on the cards are highly customized and all wrapped up in barbed wire. But at the same time, I have played poker with some custom decks, and let's face it, all that artsy-fartsy stuff doesn't mean a hill of beans if you can't tell what card you're holding. So the corner pips are essentially the old standby suits - but with a skull in the middle, because, you know, dead people.\nI did start off with some art extending off the edges of the cards, but again, I've played poker with some of those custom decks, and that art can mark the cards and make it easy to tell where the face cards are hiding. Not only that, but after being a designer for 15 years, I know that dark colors at the edge of the card make chips and scratches show up and look ugly in a hurry. So while I did get pretty wacky with borders and barbed wire and skulls and what-not, I kept the edges white. You'll be able to play with these cards for a good long time.\nA few other notes:\nI'm digging the idea of Kicking It Forward, so to that end, I've agreed that 5% of what I make on this Kickstarter will be spent supporting other startup projects on Kickstarter. Which isn't that hard, really - I spend more than I should on Kickstarter as it is. You can read more about Kicking It Forward here:\nKICKING IT FORWARD\nFinally, I want to thank Cauhaus for providing the music in the video. The song is called Rednecks with White Faces, and it's channeling Johnny Cash if he was into vampire movies. You can hear the whole song here:\nREDNECKS WITH WHITE FACES", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis might be my first Kickstarter, but it's not my first rodeo. I've owned VixenTor Games for seven years now, and have been a professional print designer since the 90s. Sure, things can go wrong, but I've allowed a wider delivery deadline than is strictly necessary so I can underpromise and overdeliver.\n\nWe could run into snags with the printer. Any good designer counts on it, even, and builds it into the timeline. If it happens, it won't be the first time a print project ran overbudget or past the print date. We stay flexible, deal with it, and hit our deadlines.\n\nWe could hit some issues with fulfillment. But again, I've done this before. I've shipped all over the globe, dealt with customs forms, ordered bulk pickups from the post office. I'm almost certain something will go wrong - but years of fixing my own mistakes has helped me learn how to deal with them, so if your order is broken, I'll make it my personal mission to make sure you're not just compensated. I want you happy.\n\nThe non-card rewards are another potential pain point. I'm not stamping the coins or building the card boxes. And working with new vendors means unpredictability - which is why I've already been in contact with those vendors and arranged fail-safes, including backups should the primary sources fall through.\n\nOne area we won't hit any problems is making the art. I've been working on these cards for nearly a year now, and this one is in the bag. The art is drawn, colored, refined, cleaned up, positioned and assembled. As soon as this Kickstarter project closes and I know how many decks we're printing, we're off to the races.\n\nI figure there are other areas where this whole thing could hit a hiccup, and I won't know about them until they happen. That's the reason for the July delivery date - it gives me time to adjust if unforeseen complications throw me a curveball.\n\nIn short, there's nobody as excited to own a deck of the Plugged Nickel Playing cards as I am. I aim to make everything as smooth as possible, because this isn't just a business venture.

Mike Ratledge of Charleston South Carolina took over ownership of UC in late 2013 after having been a moderator of the forums and bought out the previous owner, allowing the membership to direct the future of UC\".\n\"Grotesque\" is the result of this effort. With your help, it will become a reality!\nA few words about \"Grotesque\"\nThe original meaning of 'Grotesque\" was restricted to an extravagant style of Ancient Roman decorative art, rediscovered and then copied in Rome at the end of the 15th century. Since at least the 18th century (in French and German as well as English), grotesque has come to be used as a general adjective for the strange, fantastic, ugly, incongruous, unpleasant and thus is often used to describe weird shapes and distorted forms such as Halloween masks.\nAlthough there is an immense variety of motifs and figures in Grotesque style, the three main tropes of the grotesque are doubleness, hybridity and metamorphosis.\nDuring Renaissance, artists began to give the tiny faces of the figures in grotesque decorations strange caricatured expressions. In the 17th and 18th centuries the grotesque encompasses a wide field of teratology (science of monsters) and artistic experimentation.\nAlthough grotesque art mainly favored the weird, ugly and monstrous, as an artist I try to bring \"Grotesque\" to my taste and make a deck which will be at the same time strange and beautiful.\nI was always impressed by these haunting figures and about a year ago I decided to make some drawings for a deck called \"Grotesque\". After a year's nourishing, the deck finally came out and it's ready to begin its KS adventure!\nAs I did with \"Venexiana\", I'll be releasing the courts one by one during the campaign. I hope you'll enjoy the ride.\nHere's a short interview about the deck to Ivan Choe from \"kardify\" which I hope you'll find interesting.\nhttp://www.kardify.com/2014/02/kickstarter-7-questions-with-lotrek-of.html\nThank you,\nLotrek\n\"Grotesque\" will be available in two editions: The \"Original edition\" and the \"Limited edition\". Each edition will have the same faces but different back. Both editions are going to be printed only once and won't be reprinted. So, what is the difference? Read below.\n\"Grotesque\" Original Edition\nO.E. tuck case design\nThe \"Original Edition\" is what the word says: It's how the deck was conceived. If after the campaign there are decks left. they will be available in the market until they're sold out.\n\"Grotesque\" Limited  Edition\nL.E. tuck case design\nThe \"Limited Edition\" will be available ONLY during the KS campaign and ONLY for KS backers. I will not wholesale after the end of the funding period. I'll produce only the number of decks needed to fulfill all rewards. However as one cannot  determine the exact number of decks coming out of he machine, there may be some decks left. Few of them will be for sale exclusively through my website but at a really unfriendly price. The rest will have the task of dust collecting in my closet. :-)\nSIGNATURE EDITION\nSignature edition is a very special one. It has tuck case hand crafted and assembled by me, with gold or silver foil , its own custom seal and a numbered certificate of authenticity signed and dedicated to the owner. Only 60 backers will get this edition which is available in gold (called signature gold) or silver foil (called signature platinum). Each backer can have both colors but not two of the same color. 40 backers have already gotten their decks and I'll release another 20 places 3 days before the end of the campaign. The cost is $60 per deck.\nSignature edition Gold and Platinum uncut\n- Standard USPCC stock, magic finish (Bee stock if $40K is reached)\n- Embossing on the tuck case\n- Casino quality \"Bee\" stock\n- Custom seal on both editions\n- Two-way back design\n- 1 gaff card\n- Limited edition.

However, to give you a taste of what to expect, here is what real people posted on Amazon after trying out its cousin, the OBDLink MX Bluetooth:\n\u201cThe greatest thing since sliced bread! ... This is SLICK!\u201d\n\u201cMy favorite feature by far is the auto shutoff, and this adapter is the only one I'm aware of which has it. I leave it plugged in 24/7 in my car and it automatically shuts off after I turn off the car, and comes right back on when I start the engine.\"\n\u201cThis adapter has the fastest response times and supports the largest amount of data out of any of the OBD/Bluetooth adapters. If you're using a program like Torque, you'll want the extra data capacity/speed, as each gauge you add to Torque uses more bandwidth.\u201d\n\u201cDevice worked great and paired with my windows laptop and android phone with no issues. I leave it plugged in all the time and have not had any battery drain issues.\u201d\n\u201cI've used cheapo adapters before, but this one blows them out of the water. This one from Scan Tool provides information at (according to my Torque) at around 40-50 PIDs/second, at least five times that of the old adapter.\u201d\n\u201cAfter reading through a roller coaster of reviews of the Chinese knock offs, I went with the most expensive option but I think I made the right decision. This thing reads PIDs at blazing speeds, it is claimed to be the fastest on the market and I believe it. I never have to worry about a dead battery because it automatically shuts off when the OBD signal stops. It took about 10 seconds to set up on my EVO 4g.\u201d\n\u201cThis is an excellent tool that I am very pleased with. It is fast, accurate, and very useful. It is faster and easier to use than the high dollar scan tools we have in the shop! For about $150, I grab it before the shop one ($2000)! That one is left on the bench!\u201d\n \u201cThis has saved me lots of money and worry. I run a small car lot where I do most everything. Being able to know what\u2019s going on with a car before I buy it is priceless. And knowing what my mechanic told me was true or not keeps him honest.\u201d\n\u201cOBD\u201d stands for \u201cOn-Board Diagnostics\u201d, a network of small rugged computers that control everything in a modern vehicle, from engine and transmission, to anti-lock brakes and climate control. You are likely familiar with one element of the OBD system, the \u201cCheck Engine\u201d light. Another element of the system, the OBD port, allows you to access the network for troubleshooting or other purposes.\nOBDLink MX WiFi is a pocket-sized, wireless device that enables you to access the data available on the OBD network with your smart phone, tablet, or PC. The device plugs into the standard OBD port found in all modern vehicles, and requires no tools to install.\n  The average installation time is 3 minutes, including the OBDLink app download. You can safely leave it plugged in: the unique BatterySaver technology will automatically put the device to sleep. Once you plug it in, MX will appear in the list of available networks as a secure WiFi Access Point.\nThe OBD port is standard on all 1996 and newer vehicles sold in the USA. Manufacturers typically locate the OBD port in the area below the dash, as shown.\nMX supports all legislated OBD-II protocols, plus advanced Ford & GM vehicle networks (Ford MSC and GMLAN). It works with all 1996 & newer cars and light trucks sold in the United States, and also supports EOBD, JOBD, and all other international variants of OBD-II.\nWith OBDLink MX Wifi, you can use your phone or tablet as a diagnostic scan tool, trip computer, heads-up display, and even as a remote control (on select vehicles).\n\n  Create custom digital dashboards\nMeasure and display fuel economy\nDisplay, graph, and log 90+ real-time parameters\nTurn off the \u2018Check Engine\u2019 light\nRead and erase stored, pending, and permanent trouble codes (both generic and manufacturer-specific)\nAccess freeze frame information\nYou'll also get our OBDwiz software, which offers the same functionality on Windows computers.\n  Compatible third party apps offer you a wide assortment of awesome functionality, including:\nControlling windows and door locks on newer GM vehicles\nDisplaying auxiliary gauges on Google Glass\nImproving driving habits, saving money on gas, and remembering where you parked\nAnd of course, making your Honda sound like a Ferrari\nMost WiFi-enabled OBD adapters only work in so-called \u201cAd Hoc\u201d mode. With Ad-Hoc, you have to manually configure your IP settings every time you want to connect to the adapter. To make matters worse, Android users have to root their phone for Ad-Hoc adapters to work.\nOBDLink MX WiFi dispenses with the Ad Hoc mode altogether, and provides you with 3 useful modes:\nAP (Server) mode\nInfrastructure (Client) mode\nWeb Configuration\nJust select 'OBDLink MX' from the list of available WiFi networks, and enter the supplied unique passphrase. Your phone can still use 3G/4G for Internet connectivity.\nIn infrastructure mode, MX connects to an existing WiFi network. The pairing process is simple: push the WPS button on the router, then press MX\u2019s multi-function button. MX broadcasts its presence on the network, allowing compatible apps to automatically\nOBDLink MX WiFi has a built-in web interface for editing connection settings from your phone, tablet, or PC.\nProven Technology\nOBDLink MX WiFi is based on the hugely successful OBDLink MX Bluetooth, launched in 2011. It has overvoltage protection, doesn\u2019t get hot, and reliably connects to all OBD-II compliant vehicles.\n\nUnmatched Software Support\nIn addition to the included OBDLink apps and OBDwiz software, OBDLink MX WiFi will work, out-of-the-box, with dozens of existing third-party applications, across multiple mobile and desktop platforms.\n\nOpen Architecture\nWe don\u2019t use a proprietary protocol in an effort to create a closed ecosystem. In fact, we published the programming manual and designed an inexpensive OBD simulator to promote the creation of new apps. If you\u2019re interested in developing OBD applications, contact us for help getting started.\n\nPrivacy\nLast year saw the launch of a number of OBD adapters that have a cellular radio, and save user data in the cloud as part of their normal operation. We encourage you to read their user agreements before you sign up. As for our part, we promise that when you use OBDLink MX WiFi, your data will not be analyzed, used for surveillance/tracking, or sold to advertising and insurance companies. And since the data isn\u2019t automatically saved, hackers won\u2019t be able to get at it, either. With OBDLink MX, you truly have full control over your information.\n\nNo Monthly Fees\nThere\u2019s no data plan, no subscription fees, and no hidden costs.\n\nSuperior Design\nYou don't have to look hard to find cheap wireless OBD adapters of all shapes and sizes. The vast majority of them are clones of our hugely popular, but by now largely obsolete ElmScan 5 ELM327-based design. Besides getting hot and sometimes catching on fire due to questionable workmanship, these clones have a number of inherent design flaws: excessive car battery drain, lack of security, difficulty establishing and maintaining a connection, complicated setup, and disappointing data performance. OBDLink MX has been designed from the ground up to address these shortcomings.\n\n\nUNLOCKED! Thank you for your incredible support!\n  OBDLink MX supports all model year 1996+ cars and light trucks sold in the United States, as well as vehicles based on EOBD (Europe), JOBD (Japan), and all other international variants of OBD-II.\nOBDLink MX WiFi is compatible with vehicles in the above countries. For imports, compatibility is determined by the country of origin. All-electric vehicles are not required to be compliant with OBD, but hybrids are.\nOBDLink MX WiFi can work with any WiFi-enabled smart phone, tablet, or PC. Officially supported platforms (this means, we verified that MX WiFi works with apps running under these operating systems) include:\niOS (iPhone, iPad & iPod Touch)\nAndroid phones & tablets\nWindows Phone\nWindows 2000 and later PCs\nGiven MX\u2019s open architecture and strict adherence to the 802.11 standard, we anticipate apps to be developed for other platforms as well. In fact, compatible third party applications are already popping up for several other platforms, including Blackberry and Linux.\nOBDLink MX works with Android, iOS, & Windows operating systems. Use it with any WiFi-enabled phone, tablet, or laptop.\n\nYou'll have lots of app and software options, as OBDLink MX is backwards-compatible with the popular ELM327 command set. Here's a small sample of apps and software we recommend:\n\niOS:\nOBDLink (free, exclusive)\nDashCommand\nHarry\u2019s Lap Timer\nAndroid:\nOBDLink\nDash\nTorque Pro\nobdCANex\nDashCommand\nWindows:\nOBDwiz (free, exclusive)\nScanMaster\nScanXL\nDashCommand\n\nMX WiFi won't interfere with your legroom while driving, and fits in your pocket!\n\nWireless module: 802.11b/g\nEncryption: AES128\nCurrent consumption: 100 mA (normal), 0-10 mA (sleep)\nDimensions: 1.97 x 1.77 x 0.91 inches (51 x 45 x 23 mm)\nWeight: 1.2 oz (33 g)\nOperating Voltage: 8-18V DC\nOperating Temperature: -4\u00ba to 131\u00ba F (-20\u00ba to 55\u00ba C)\nOperating Humidity: 10 to 85% (non-condensing)\nISO 15765-4 (CAN)\nISO 14230-4 (Keyword Protocol 2000)\nISO 9141-2 (Asian, European, Chrysler vehicles)\nSAE J1850 VPW (GM vehicles)\nSAE J1850 PWM (Ford vehicles)\nSAE J2411 (GMLAN, Single Wire CAN)\nFord MSC (Medium Speed CAN)\nFebruary: Finish debugging WiFi firmware, final integration testing.\nMarch: Order packaging & print documentation. Receive and test production samples. Begin production.\nApril: Package and ship the first production units.\nNormally, it takes six weeks to receive the first batch of a new design. However, we already sourced electronic components, raw PCBs, and enclosures to shave 2 weeks off the schedule. Also, we plan to deploy new-generation assembly-line testers, which should reduce the test time by over half. In the best possible scenario, we expect to start shipping production units in mid-April.\nJoe Baumbach, Senior Engineer\nJoe has a Bachelor\u2019s degree in Computer Engineering Technology from DeVry University, and handles all aspects of the hardware design -- digital, analog, and RF. He is responsible for capturing schematics, laying out PCBs, testing prototypes, and preparing files for manufacturing.\nDave Beecham, Director of Business Development\nDave is tasked with doing market research to ensure that MX WiFi\u2019s feature set meets customers\u2019 needs, and is responsible for developing the marketing strategy (this Kickstarter is a part of it).

Vitaliy graduated from DeVry University with a degree in Computer Engineering Technology.\nJason Smith, Senior Engineer\nJason is responsible for creating the assembly-line tester, which will be used by the factory to program and stress-test the devices to make sure they will long outlast our 3-year warranty. Jason earned his degree in Electronic Engineering Technology from DeVry University.\nIt\u2019s been a long journey, but we are nearing the finish line: the prototypes are meeting our expectations, and as soon as the remaining WiFi glitches are fixed, we will be ready to begin production. All we need, is one last push. Your pledges will be used to cover the cost of manufacturing the first batch of OBDLink MX WiFi\u2019s.\nDon\u2019t wait to make your pledge: we are practically giving away the first 100 units, and once they\u2019re gone, they\u2019re gone.

While testing the prototypes, engineers discovered several elusive glitches that may negatively affect user experience. The engineers created a suite of automated tests, and are working with the vendor on tracking down the remaining bugs. If worst comes to worst, our contingency plan calls for implementing workarounds in the driver code.\n\n* New assembly-line tester. Using lessons learned from the previous generation testers, we designed a new tester to drastically reduce the time necessary to test each unit, and provide more details about the failures, which will enable the production manager to quickly identify and correct manufacturing problems. There is a small chance that it may not be ready in time for production, forcing the factory to fall back to using the slower old testers.\n\n* Unforeseen manufacturing difficulties. Over our 12 years in business, we\u2019ve seen projects get delayed for all sorts of reasons: from being unable to buy a particular transistor, to floods that keep delivery trucks from reaching the factory. To minimize this risk, we followed a stringent, proven pre-production checklist. Barring natural disasters, there should not be any delays due to manufacturing.\n\nOBDLink MX WiFi was designed by the same team of engineers that designed the hugely successful OBDLink MX Bluetooth, and will be manufactured at the same facility. The two devices have comparable complexity, and share many design concepts.\n\nThe STN11xx codebase that is at the heart of MX, has been road-tested on over 100,000 vehicles of every imaginable make and model, in every part of the world -- from Africa to Alaska.

The magicians head was moved away from the Bicycle logo.\n A Note from the artist:\nI began with the idea of the flames burning in front of a pyromaniac and thought about the beauty he probably sees in them, maybe as flame dancers, and that is how the fire started.\nThe main problem with it was how to make each court different if they were suppose to be all in flames, all the same color, etc... So i tried to give each one of them a particular air.\n-The club court has vegetal details, the color is a little orange-softer, i tried to make them kinder than the rest.\n-The diamond court has little details of jewellery, and more yellow than the others. The queen has a rich organized brench, pearls and a certain desdain, the king is crowning himself, and the jack exhibits himself proudly.\n-The heart court is the most simple of the courts because i wanted it to be a little dark and pure as desire.\n-The spade court is easier to explain, all of them hold spades, knifes or a spear of fire, the cards have more red to remember the blood or the anger and all of them have an agresive attitude.\nThe jokers are the magician in the tuck case, is the Pyromaniac who was finally burnt by the flames and has become a flame skeleton devil, who plays with the burning cards coming out from his top hat.\nAnd then all those spades, hearts, clubs and diamonds remain inside of the top hat, with the fabric liner holding them until they come out to play their magic.\nThis high quality metal chrome flip top lighter is a wick, flint and fluid fuel petrol lighter.

You can learn more about him by visiting the website.\nI had three sources of inspiration for drawing these portraits:\nFirst, historic records of Persian legends. I've researched etchings, archaeological images, remaining statues, books and stories of these people to picture their appearances.\nSecond, Iran\u2019s most precious form of art: Persian rugs. When I was a child my lovely grandmother sat me by her rug frame (called \u201cdaar\u201d) and taught me how to weave a rug and read patterns. I've been bewitched by that art since.\nThird, my love and passion for this inherited art and history. It excites me to finally find my original style of drawing. I constantly seek opportunities to make this art accessible through my designs.\n   Each suit is marked by a Tazhib element which is also used in Persian rug patterns. Each of them depicts a unique time in Persian History. In your deck you will find:\nSpade: Achaemenid\nClub: Sassanian\nHeart: Zand\nDiamond: Safavids\nIn the video, you might have noticed that I mistakenly mention 'Abbasids'. Unfortunately I found out about my mistake after the video production was completed and couldn't fix it. I wanted to clarify that Diamonds represent \"Safavids\" dynasty.\n    Design of Jokers is based on a traditional Eslimi element called \u201cBotteh\u201d.\nDetailed with intricate patterns, the two color theme backs has luxurious looks with gold accents.  \nDrawing these portraits was a year-long journey of going through buried tales in history books. I wanted to share my process and inspirations with you, so I designed a book to compliment the collection. The book tells short stories of each of the face-card characters. My goal is to have these stories constructed in a casual but mystic tone to achieve a level of stickiness not found in typical story books. \nIn Partnership with Ramin Takloo\nI am very excited to announce my partnership with Prof. Ramin Takloo-Bighash in writing the Surena story book.\nRamin Takloo-Bighash is a professor of mathematics at the University of Illinois at Chicago. He received his doctorate at Johns Hopkins University in 2001, and subsequently taught at Princeton from 2001 to 2007 before moving to Chicago. Other than mathematics, he is interested in literature, history, and music. His other ongoing projects include a translation of Shahram Shaydai's \"Laughing in the burning house\" (with Amy Grupp) from Persian to English, and a novella about his experiences growing up in the south of Iran during the Iran-Iraq war. He is also a member of the Middle-East Music Ensemble at the University of Chicago. He and his family live in Evanston, IL.\n (Renderings of the book below, contain place holder texts and does not display the actual stories of the book.

Enjoy the comforts of a padded room with this delightfully liberating deck, and treat yourself with the playing cards by which the Joker himself would be proud of.\nWe have created a deck with the goal of satisfying the highest demands of playing card users everywhere - primarily players, magicians, collectors, and cinema admirers. We put tremendous effort and creativity in creating an interesting deck with innovative design, but ultimate functionality for everyday players and pros alike. We respect traditional values and standards, successfully incorporating new aspects of design which blend into a unified design with an intriguing background. With never before seen faces, each card is easily recognizable and easy to read.  These faces will only be printed once, and then shall re-enter the asylum, never to return.\nWe are big fans of classic horror movies. We found some of our inspiration for Asylum in some of the anthological movies and retro/cult cinematographic creations and characters. (consider it as our tribute to the masters of the silver screen such as Vincent Price, Kathy Bates, Sir Anthony Hopkins, etc.)\nThe main word which correlates to Asylum Deck is \"CUSTOM.\" Everything is fully customized, patiently painted and designed for this once-in-a-lifetime-deck opportunity. Every Card, every symbol on every card, Jokers, court cards, special cards, everything. Through all of its segments, Asylum is accompanied by slightly deviant background taste, which fits perfectly in the overall concept. We devote special attention to the characters on the court cards, made them unique, yet slightly resembling to some of the most famous \"loonies\" from the history and cinematography. The main image from the box is specially designed as a tribute to the great art of Alphonse Mucha and Art Nouveau movement, but adopted in our unique manner and style.\nMagicians and illusionists weren't neglected at all during the creative process. On the contrary, we respected every aspect of their needs. From the important features of symmetry, density of ornamental structures, special and double back cards, to the quality of material, making cards easy to handle. That's why we choose the USPCC as our playing card partners, and are offering high-quality BICYCLE\u00ae grade cards.\nSPECIAL REWARDS DETAIL\n\"Deal-irium\" Dealer Button - Ceramic Chip\n\"There will never be a doubt as to who is the most delirious in each poker round!\"\nADD-ONS!!!!\nAsylum Dice!

BentCastle features the combined talents of Chris Pallace (illustrator) and Ben Crenshaw (designer).  We've come to reach out to the Kickstarter Community for help getting our latest playing card deck underway.\nTHE DECK\nThe new deck employs lavish Steampunk styling, but to a very specific purpose: our homage to Jules Verne.  It's titled, Deck of the Extraordinary Voyages, and draws from a collection of works by Jules Verne known as Les Voyages Extraordinaires.  Within the deck, each suit draws upon his worlds for its theme and imagery. Spades rule the ground and below, Hearts the skies, Diamonds the stars, and Clubs the oceans.\nWe've got finished art for the aces, numbered cards, backs, box cover, and a few of the face cards. From these you can see the passion and scope of our vision for the completed deck.  As a supporter, you will see the creative process as it unfolds.  As we complete the remaining face cards, jokers, and Emissaries (explained below), we'll post updates.\nAbout our decks, for those of you who are not yet familiar:\nWe print a 60 card deck. To the standard 52 plus two Jokers, we add four X cards, a double-backed card, and a blank. Those last two are for our magician friends. If you don't know what they're for I can't tell you, because you're not a magician.\nThe four X cards are for gamers, who will be more than happy to tell you all about the games they play and invent that utilize these extra cards.  The X cards have added an extra conceptual and art dimension to each of the decks  we've created.  In our Pirate deck they were Sea Serpents, in the Zombie deck Grim Reapers, and in this deck they are Emissaries: from the moon, the undersea kingdom, the skies, and subterranean kingdoms.\nCARD QUALITY\nOur decks are top quality playing cards. They are intended to be as close to a Bicycle playing card as possible. They are not Bicycle playing cards because USPCC will only print a 56 card deck. I am sure some of our kickstarter faithful can attest to the quality of our decks.\nOVER-FUNDING BONUSES\nShould we reach more than our funding goal of $13,500, we will use it to order a larger print run.  This, in turn, will allow us to price the cards a bit lower- just enough that we can afford to get some extras for you!  (Lots of math went into this part, trust me.)  We already have three bonuses figured out, and will add more if you guys go nuts for this deck.\n18,000 Bonus 1 - Wallpapers\n24,000 Bonus 2 - Stickers & Signature card\n30,000 Bonus 3 - 1865 Patch\nArt for the patch.
