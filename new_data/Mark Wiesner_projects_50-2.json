[{"backer": "Mark Wiesner", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Born into the outcast breed of werewolves known as the Monoki, eighteen-year-old Rodney Marcelli is reluctantly pulled into an ancient war between good and evil, during a modern time where the line has blurred. \nWith the help of Snow Paw, the Pureblood Monoki, and the supernatural evil slayer, Night Hunter, Rod must learn to master his newly found lycanthropy and mysterious kinetic energy power that only he possesses. Rod must fight the Dark Covenant in order to avenge his friends and family, and to save the girl he loves from the master vampire, Lord Malice. \nRodney Marcelli is Night Wolf!\nWelcome to the Night Wolf #1-5: Urban Fantasy Werewolf Coming of Age Drama Kickstarter campaign! My name is Robert A. Multari and I'm the creator/writer of Night Wolf. \nIt has been my dream since I was a kid, struggling with Attention Deficit Disorder and Dyslexia, to be a comic book creator because comic books have helped me to overcome my learning disabilities. I've had the pleasure of self-publishing Night Wolf Issues 1 through 4, with the help of my past Kickstarter backers, who I refer to as my Wolf Pack. \nNow, I stand ready to publish my Night Wolf Issue 5 which is 100% complete, and is ready to send off to the printers. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve come back to pay for the printing and the rewards that you will receive for backing my project.\nThe Kickstarter staff on on day one selected Night Wolf #1-5: Urban Fantasy Werewolf Coming-of-Age Drama as a \u201cProject We Love,\u201d which is their way of highlighting brilliant examples of creativity. We are very thankful and honored that we were tagged!\nNight Wolf Issue 1\nRodney Marcelli, a small town high school senior from a wealthy family, had everything a teenage boy could want; popularity, a beautiful girlfriend, and a full-ride football scholarship to Keystone State University. However, as his eighteenth birthday draws near Rodney is haunted by nightmares of ghoulish creatures and visions of losing his loved ones. During his waking life, Rodney starts to notice elements of his nightmares are coming true as vampires, werewolves, witches, and demons start to invade his sleepy little town.\nNight Wolf Issue 2\nRodney, still haunted by nightmarish visions, has a growing concern that something terrible is about to happen in his sleepy little town. On the night of his 18th birthday, Rod and his girlfriend, Jennifer Conway, are attending their high school Homecoming Dance, where they are crowned Queen and King. Their celebration dance is cut short by the twin witches, Janelle and Circe, who crash the party unleashing monsters upon the unsuspecting student body and faculty. Rod and Jen barely make their escape outside only to be confronted by the bloodthirsty werewolf, Black Claw.\nNight Wolf Issue 3\nRodney is left for dead after his first encounter with the cruel werewolf, Black Claw, who has taken Rod\u2019s girlfriend, Jennifer Conway, prisoner. Rod awakens the next morning in the hospital where he overhears a doctor speaking with FBI Agents, who want to question Rod about the four missing teenage girls and the massacre at the Homecoming Dance. Afraid the Agents would not believe him, Rod quickly escapes out a window. Upon returning home, Rod discovers a horrifying scene left for him. Then, without warning he is overtaken by horde of vampires and werewolves.\nNight Wolf Issue 4\nAfter fending off a horde of vampires and werewolves, Rodney and Snow Paw flee to escape the FBI Special Investigation Agents, who have come to investigate the scene. While hiding in the dense woods behind Rodney\u2019s family\u2019s home, Snow Paw tells him of their Monoki werewolf heritage. Snow Paw concludes that Rodney is unlike all other members of their breed. Then without warning, the supernatural monster slayer, Night Hunter, drops in on them armed to the teeth, with his sights on Rodney.\nNight Wolf Issue 5\nAfter gathering supplies from his family home, Rodney Marcelli embarks on a journey with Snow Paw to one of her safe houses deep in the Appalachian Mountains. Upon arrival, Snow Paw wastes no time to begin Rodney\u2019s weapons training and teaching him how to control his lycanthropy, in preparation for the upcoming battle against the Dark Covenant. Meanwhile, FBI Special Investigation Agents are hot on their trail, and Lord Malice\u2019s sinister plan for Jennifer Conway starts to unfold.\nFans of Supernatural, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Underworld, and other anti-hero monster horror stories.\nPeople who like stories that encompass elements of horror, magic, and science in a modern setting.\nCollectors of high-quality modern independent comic books from an amazing team of up-and-comers!\nAnyone who likes unique takes on the horror, supernatural, theology, mythology, and fantasy genres.\nAnyone who loves stories about supernatural beings like werewolves,  vampires, demons, witches, zombies and more.\nWhat Exactly Do You Get When You Join the WOLF PACK and Back This Campaign?\nAll issues of Night Wolf are 24 pages printed on high-quality paper.\nAll backers at any pledge level will receive a FREE digital copy of HAUNTING #1 by Phil Falco!\nAll backers at any pledge level will receive a FREE digital copy of Monster Matador #1 by Steven Prince!\nAll backers at any pledge level will receive a FREE digital copy of Killeroo: Scars by Darren Close!\nAll backers at any pledge level will receive a FREE digital copy of Xtreme Champion Tournament (XCT): Spartacus by Shaun Keenan!\nAll backers at any pledge level will receive a FREE digital copy of Crucifx Executioner #1 by Killer Comics!\nAll backers at any pledge level will receive a FREE digital copy of The Wild Warriors #1 by Camilo Ruiz!\nAll backers at any physical pledge level will receive a FREE Night Wolf #5 2x6\" Bookmark by Carlos Herrera and Gat Melvyn!\nAll backers at any physical pledge level will receive a FREE Exclusive Night Wolf #5 Retail Cover 5x7\" Print by Carlos Herrera!

It\u2019s been my dream since I was a kid, struggling with Attention Deficit Disorder and Dyslexia, to be in the comic book business. Comic books helped me learn how to deal with my learning disability. When I was 14-years-old, I wrote fan fiction for the X-Men and submitted it to Marvel in hopes that Stan Lee would read it. Someone from Marvel was nice enough to write back to me saying that Stan loves to hear from his fans and encouraged me to keep up my writing. As naive as I was at the time, it spread my passion for the business like a wild fire and inspired me to go to art school at Edinboro University of Pennsylvania, where I graduated with a Bachelor of Fine Arts Degree in Applied Media Arts. I have been working on Night Wolf since I was 16-years-old. The story and the characters have grown up with me, evolving into the amazing tale that it is today.\nWhy a werewolf comic book? Well, I have always loved any werewolf or supernatural related entertainment in movies, video games, etc. I didn't feel like there were any comic books out there doing werewolves any justice, so I decided to make a comic book based on a werewolf anti-hero myself. In high school, after I started developing Night Wolf, I got into Werewolf: The Apocalypse is a role-playing game by White Wolf Publishing.  I love the artwork in the game guides so much that I longed for them to put out a comic book to build on their world. Unfortunately, it never happened, but the artwork heavily influenced how I like my werewolves should look in my comics.\nFollow Robert A.

I appreciate so it so much!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIn April of 2016, I launched a failed Kickstarter campaign for Night Wolf Issues 1-3. I played the game on hard, setting a $20,000 goal. However, I did manage to raise $5,064 from my 74 backers, unfortunately Kickstarter is all or nothing. At the time I only had the character designs, a cover and 5 sequential pages during that launch. Even though the Kickstarter didn\u2019t fund I was bound and determined to publish my story. Because I didn\u2019t have the funds to finish the first issue, I decided to raise the money on my own doing freelance web design work to pay for the artwork.\n\nAfter self-publishing Night Wolf Issues 1 and 2, I launched another Kickstarter in October 2019 to print Night Wolf Issues 3 with a more reasonable funding goal of $5,000. The campaign successfully over funded, thanks to the amazing 217 backers that I refer to as my Wolf Pack. Since then I have launch two more successfully over funded Kickstarter campaigns, thanks to returning/new Wolf Pack members, for Night Wolf Issue 4 and the Night Wolf Volume 1 trade paperback. Now, I'm back and ready to release Night Wolf Issue 5 which is 100% completely finished and print ready!\n\nI know 2020 was very challenging, and there is still a lot going on all over the world right now in 2021. This turmoil is very stressful for us all. Collecting, reading, and creating comics books have always been an escape from the stressful things in my life. My hope is that by creating my comics books and putting them out into the world for you to enjoy also helps to relieve some of your stress as well. And that is what I am laser focused on doing!\n\nIn addition, I have been educating myself through the Comixlaunch course, which is a Kickstarter training program created by Tyler James. Tyler is the Publisher of ComixTribe and has successfully funded many Kickstarter campaigns. Through the ComixLaunch community I have also been a part of a ComixLaunch Mastermind group of independent creators that have all ran successful campaigns in the past, and I've spent time learning and being mentored by the very talented members of the group.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "Digital Edition", "descp": "Backers at this level will receive the digital copy of Night Wolf #5 as well as this Kickstarter's video theme song MP3, Mind Games by Crimson Dawn\nINCLUDES:\nNight Wolf #5 Digital Edition\nTheme MP3 - Mind Games by Crimson Dawn\nThank You On the \"WOLF PACK DEN\" Website Wall!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2021"}], "stat": ["101 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 15 or more", "title": "Print Edition: Carlos Herrera Cover", "descp": "Backers at this level will receive the 24-page print edition of Night Wolf #5 featuring the standard retail cover by Carlos Herrera, the digital copy of Night Wolf #5, and the Kickstarter's video theme song MP3, Mind Games by Crimson Dawn\nINCLUDES:\nNight Wolf #5 Print Standard Cover By Carlos Herrera\nNight Wolf #5 Digital Edition\nTheme MP3 - Mind Games by Crimson Dawn\nThank You On the \"WOLF PACK DEN\" Website Wall!\nFREE SHIPPING IN THE US!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["125 backers", "Add-ons"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 18 or more", "title": "Digital Catch-Up", "descp": "Backers at this level will receive digital copies of Night Wolf #5 and the Night Wolf Volume 1 Digital Edition, which collects the first four issues of Night Wolf and features extra bonus content, over 150 pages of story and art!

While most fans of the era can quote various episodes and talk in depth about character backstory, James' encyclopedic knowledge goes much deeper. He can tell you when and where characters appear with slightly different color shades, when lines were dubbed in, when and where storyboards were different than the final episode, and knows all about unproduced shows and future plans. He lives and breathes it and specifically, He-Man and the Masters of the Universe. Ever since he was a kid, he's wanted to tell He-Man stories and while he's authored books for Dark Horse detailing every single episode of the beloved cartoon, edited the celebrated fan magazine, cereal:geek, and remains a popular resource for 80s cartoons, his childhood goal has alluded him - until 2017. \nFour years ago, James decided he was going to fulfill his dreams and create an unofficial He-Man cartoon that, ideally, would seamlessly fit into the heralded Filmation version of the famed character. The look, the sounds, the voices, the music - It was all going to be like the Filmation series. After 3.5 years of hard work with a handful of collaborators all volunteering their efforts because they shared the same passion as James, the cartoon was completed and ready to showcase at Power-Con - and then came the legal warnings from NBC/Universal, the rights holder for He-Man and the Masters of the Universe. With his childhood dream on the precipice of becoming a reality, James must now choose what he wants to do: does he shelve it and save himself from expensive legal action? Does he find a way around the situation? Does he release it no matter what - because dreams matter more than money? Of course, he has decided to journey forward!\nJames Eatock at Power-Con 2019\nWhile chronicling James' journey to create and release his unofficial cartoon, we will talk to industry insiders, animation aficionados, and cartoon lovers from everywhere about the impact of cartoons, the current state of cartoon culture, Saturday morning, weekday and prime time Cartoons, the rise and fall of Filmation, the impact of He-Man and the Masters of the Universe, Fan Films and so much more!!!\nWhile the main drive of the film will be James' story including his beginnings, personal life and so forth, it's all being wrapped in a giant discussion about cartoons with some of the most respected and talented people on the planet. So what kind of topics will the film showcase? LOTS:\nCartoon history/evolution, the rise and fall of Saturday Morning, emergence of afternoon/weekday cartoon dominance, prime time toons, cartoons and learning, hand-drawn vs CG, Cartoon Network and 24/7 cartoons, cartoons for adults, branding/licensing, cartoons and politics, cartoons and toys, viewer impact, domestic and foreign production, cartoon heroes and villains, from movies to television to youtube and SO MANY MORE!\nThose are some very broad topics but just know our focus rests in episode content created for television - that's what we consider cartoons for the purposes of this film - even when practice was to bundle theatrical shorts for air on TV.\n\nBut what cartoons will we discuss and showcase?\nOf course, we'll discuss He-Man and the Masters of the Universe and She-ra: Princess of Power given the obvious tie to James' story, but we'll also explore other shows like G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero, Transformers, M.A.S.K., C.O.P.S., Visionaries, The Mighty Hercules, Blackstar, Bravestarr, The Real Ghostbusters, Captain Planet, Reboot, Scooby-Doo, The Flintstones, The Simpsons, South Park, Rick and Morty, Adventure Time, Batman: The Animated Series, X-Men, Spider-Man, Thundercats but basically whatever  people bring up during our discussions! There is certainly a heavy 80s and 90s influence with the above shows, but it would be impossible to tell this story and leave out hits from the 60s and 70s, plus everything that's happened in the last 20 years too!\n\nIt's also no surprise, given the title that we will be looking specifically at the work of Filmation, since that studio directly impacted James and had a HUGE part in creating Saturday Morning (and weekday afternoon) cartoon culture. We'll look and explore the vast majority of their shows in some way and look to explore their full history.\nLou Scheimer, New York Times Article, 2013\nWill the film discuss any other topics?\nGiven the nature of James' story, we'll look into the history of fan-driven projects and all the legal issues with creating content that one might not own.\nHere are some of the people who have agreed to participate in our production if we get funded:\nErika Scheimer - Producer/Production Coordinator/Voice Actor, He-Man, She-Ra\nRob Lamb - Writer/Storyboard Artist, He-Man, She-Ra, Filmation's Ghostbusters\nTom Tataranowicz - Director/Producer/Animator, He-Man, She-Ra, Biker Mice from Mars\nAndy Mangels - Co-Author, Creating the Filmation Generation\nLarry Houston - X-Men: TAS, G.I. Joe, TMNT, C.O.P.S., Batman: TAS, Exosquad\nJ. Larry Carroll - Writer, TMNT, Captain Planet, G.I. Joe, Thundercats, Bravestarr, She-ra\nVictor Dal Chele - Director/Storyboard Artist, Extreme Ghostbusters, Exosquad, SWAT Kats\nRon Friedman - Writer, Transformers: The Movie, Bionic Six, G.I. Joe, Fantastic Four\nBrynne Chandler - Writer, Batman: TAS, Spider-Man, Gargoyles, TMNT, He-Man, She-ra\nChristy Marx - Writer, Bucky O'Hare, G.I. Joe, Dino-Riders, Jem\nZadoc Angell - Co-founder of The He-Man and She-Ra Episode Review Website & Producer, Van Helsing\nVal Staples - Event Director, Power-Con\n\"MOTU Joe\" Teague - Masters of the Universe collector and pop culture expert\nDaniel Benedict - Filmmaker, Fall of Grayskull, The Bloody Man\nDusan Mitrovic - Director/Producer, The Return of Faker\nAndrew Cramer - Lead colorist, The Return of Faker\nKeith Seymour - Special FX, The Return of Faker\nJukka Issakainen - Writer, Dark Horse MOTU books / Colorist, \"The Return of Faker\"\nJay Bartlett - Toy Collector, Action Figure Adventure, Nintendo Quest\nJordan Morris - Writer, Former Toy Store Owner\nGlenn Stanway - Video Game Producer\nAND MANY MORE PROFESSIONALS, FANS, COLLECTORS, INSIDERS AND PEOPLE LIKE YOU!\n BASE GOAL - \"SORTA FAKING IT\" - $30,000 - ACHIEVEMENT UNLOCKED!!!! \nOur base goal lets us tell more of the story about Filmation, James, and his initial mission with his cartoon, The Return of Faker. You'll see and hear more about this pioneering studio via interviews with people that worked there, and people from the animation industry. You'll hear about the impact and evolution of cartoon culture with as many people as can film. NOTE: Due to the pandemic and the on-going, ever-changing travel and health restrictions, we might have to capture most of these interviews remotely. \n\n STRETCH GOAL - \"THE RETURN OF FAKER?\" - $37,500 - ACHIEVEMENT UNLOCKED!!!!\nThis is a fun add-on that we'll give to all backers that pledge above $29 for a physical reward. Essentially, we'll send a second disc-cover your way that'll make your DVD or Blu Ray case feel like the ultimate unofficial release of James' cartoon, \"The Return of Faker.\" While this alternate art hasn't been designed yet, expect it be quite nostalgic. Remember, \"The Return of Faker\" is an unofficial, fan-film and this campaign and documentary focuses on the process to create, and, potentially and legitimately release the cartoon as it pertains to the larger telling of James' story. As such, there will be some process elements that appear on parts of the cover - because that's what this is all about!\nJames Eatock's Dream Art for this stretch goal! We know it can't be this for legal reasons - but too fun not to share!\n\n STRETCH GOAL  - \"COMPLETELY FAKING IT\" - $50,000 - ACHIEVEMENT UNLOCKED!!!!\nThis is the master ULTIMATE vision, the project we really want to make. This allows us to trace the history of Saturday morning cartoons, the rise of Filmation, and the origins of the He-Man and the Masters of the Universe cartoon and how all of this impacted James at an early age. We'll chart James' story and other fans that have dared to make unofficial tributes to the shows and brands that impacted them - and we'll also see what happens next in James' journey forward with The Return of Faker, specifically watching him try to achieve his NINE goals for his cartoon. Production quality increases as our resources increase, so we hope to conduct interviews in peson versus remotely. NOTE: This version will take more time since we will be traveling, and shooting with more people - but the result will be night and day compared to the $30K version.\nTHANK YOU!!!\n\n STRETCH GOAL - MINI COMIC - $65,000 - ACHIEVEMENT UNLOCKED!!!! \nEveryone who's backed at $29 for a physical reward item, or HIGHER, will receive a brand new FAKE 8-page Mini Comic. The mini comic will emulate the look and feel of the original Masters of the Universe mini comics (see below), but contain all new unofficial fan-created content related to our campaign. Do we have the power to hit this goal?\nOriginal Masters of the Universe Mini Comic, shown to illustrate the look, feel and size of our unofficial FAKE fan mini comic!\n STRETCH GOAL - LONGER RUNTIME - $80,000 - ACHIEVEMENT UNLOCKED!!!! \nWe did it? YOU DID IT!\n STRETCH GOAL - Stand-alone Short Documentary - $90,000 - ACHIEVEMENT UNLOCKED!!!! \nIF WE HIT $90,000, ALL THE BACKERS will get a 22-44mins stand-alone short documentary on a subject matter that ALL THE BACKERS get to vote on and suggest topic ideas. This stand-alone piece could be an expanded look at Filmation or another animation studio, it could be a look at another cartoon series like Thundercats or G.I. Joe, or it could about the cross pollination between European, American and Asian studios and creators, and that impact on the industry. LOTS OF OPTIONS and we will sort those possibilities out IF we hit $90,000 AFTER the campaign.\nHow is this possible? That sounds like a lot more work! It's true, it will be more work, but going into our interviews, we can reserve some time to address the subject matter and craft responses just for this piece of bonus content. Essentially, if we're talking about cartoons, animation and evolution with people anyway, we will push for a few more questions about this topic. On top of that, we can use voice over and imagery to connect the dots and tell the story, whatever that may be. Since we do not know if we will hit $90,000, and since we do not know the subject matter, it's really hard to predict the length which is why we have left the length up in the air. I think it would be safer to suggest something shorter and the more we raise above and beyond the $90K, the more we can explore the subject while continuing to support our main documentary. MORE is BETTER!\n STRETCH GOAL - SHOW THE WORLD - $100,000 - ACHIEVEMENT UNLOCKED!!!! \nHitting $100,000 is the ultimate symbol of support for all things Filmation, Masters of the Universe and James - it shows the world how much this stuff matters. Such a feat might even help James on his journey to properly and publicly release \u201cThe Return of Faker\u201d and could even conjure additional intangible rewards for all of us because we chose to make this happen now because this stuff DOES matter; it's not just for kids. So, let's send a signal and shine a beacon of hope for all the Filmation fans out there, those who love and adore Lou Scheimer and his legacy, and all of us in the cartoon community. WE CAN DO THIS!!\nJames and Lou\nBE IN THE FILM!\nSelecting this tier guarantees you a spot in the film or one of our select bonus features. Share you opinion, thoughts and feelings on any number of things we might ask, but it'll likely relate to He-Man, Filmation, Cartoons or James Eatock! Filming with you will depend our on our funding level, travel restrictions and your schedule and location. For example, we may cross paths at Power-Con. We may not. In a worst case scenario, we will look to employ tools like Zoom or Skype to get you in the film. \n\nON-SCREEN CREDITS!\nThese credits are great for adding to your IMDB page and of course sharing your love and passion about our film project. The Executive Producer tier even lets you see early and rough cuts of the film ahead of everyone and anyone else!\n\nDIGITAL DOWNLOADS\nWe're making DRM-Free digital versions of our documentary and all the bonus features available for all tiers, so no matter which tier you select you will always have access to these goodies forever.\n\nRETRO SLIDE VIEWER\nEnjoy this add-on item with any tier. You'll get exclusive access to unique imagery with this fun retro experience. Will you dare to view these top secret images?\n\nVHS COPY\nWe're offering a limited number of VHS Copies of the Documentary and we will add whatever bonus features fit with whatever remaining space on the VHS tape. These will be extremely limited but also give access to our Digital materials.\n\nBLU-RAY and DVD COPIES\nWe're offering our documentary on region free (region 0) Blu-Ray and DVD discs. They will include select bonus features - mainly due to space restrictions - but you'll be able to access and download all our bonus features digitally. Also, we have another tier that includes a second Blu-ray Disc that'll be packed full of Bonus Content and will have at least ONE item that IS NOT available anywhere else.\n\nASSOCIATE PRODUCER TIER\nHave your name listed as an associate producer in the end credits of the film AND, if you so wish, James will add your name to the end of \"The Return of Faker\" too! PLUS you'll get our DVD/BLU Ray Cereal Box-Like Slip Case designed by James Eatock! Free Prize inside as well! And James has offered to send you a Filmation-Like Faker Model sheet as well - if you select this tier or higher!\n\nEXECUTIVE PRODUCER TIER\nWe love our executive producers so much that we're now adding a few special perks to that tier not directly listed. Our Exec Producers will now receive a VHS Copy of our film (if desired) as well as a special separate poster print not shown yet, our Retro Slide Viewer and their likeness done in Filmation style and added to \"The Return of Faker\" too! \n\nSPONSOR THE FILM!\nIn addition to everything listed in the Executive Producer tier and the listed criteria, your name/brand/company/show/convention/event LOGO will be shown up front at the very beginning of the film for all to see, mentioned in all our advertising, on all our physical media (discs, posters etc) and in press releases. We reserve the right to restrict, limit, adjust or manipulate that logo, name, or wording if it's not appropriate, causes legal infringement or represents bad taste. You must supply your logo for us and perform any required technical adjustments we need to include it in the film. Below is an example of how we've shown sponsor logos in other productions:\nExample of Sponsor Credits as seen in the \"The Jay And Rob Toy Show\"\nDigital Mock-Up - what secret imagery might we include??? You'll have to wait and see!\nVHS mock-up\n\nFaking Filmation Blu-Ray Mock Up\nFaking Filmation DVD Mock Up\nWelcome to the world of ADD-ONs for Kickstarter campaigns! Want 2 DVDs, Blu-Rays or something else we're offering? Here's your chance! People have demanded Kickstarter add the ability for people to load up their pledge with multiple items above and beyond a specific tier - and we love this too! For our campaign you'll find extra copies of the movie, but also, unique items like Posters and Sketches that aren't part of the other tiers. So if you want the add-on items, you have to back at a tier to access them!\nHere's a sample sketch that we're offering, wonderfully illustrated by James Eatock. James will offer these to any backer and CHALLENGES you to make him draw ANY CHARACTER from any CARTOON! Limit one character per sketch, done in this unique style. These sketches will likely be sent independently of other rewards.\nSample Sketch by James Eatock\nWe're also offering DVD/Blu-Ray slip cases that emulate that fun cereal box aesthetic and ours has been designed by James Eatock. Of course if we're talking cereal box, you've gotta have a free prize inside!\nHere's a rough, work-in-progress shot of our DVD/Blu Ray Cereal Box Slip Case!\n One more unique Add-On is the chance to have your likeness done in Filmation Style! AND, with your permission, James will add your filmation-likeness to a crowdshot in \"The Return of Faker.\" You'll also get a digital image of the crowd shot emailed to you too!\nWhile we thought just turning you into a \"Filmation\" version of yourself was cool, James wanted to take it to the next level!\nMany of you visiting this campaign are curious if we will include The Return of Faker as  bonus material, in some sort of uncut, unaltered capacity. I can say our current goal is to include The Return of Faker as a piece of bonus content. To make this possible, we will seed the cartoon center-frame and have various \"pop-up facts\" that appear throughout the runtime that further showcase the process to make the unofficial cartoon come to fruition. None of the pop-ups will cover the cartoon but will appear beside the cartoon and point out things like dialogue that was used from other episodes, instances where other Filmation cartoon characters were used for reference poses, FX work etc. This is important because a lot of time and effort went into creating this unofficial cartoon and given that the focus of this documentary is the cartoon, it's creation and hopefully, it's release, showcasing it uncut and in full, further showcases our goals.\nA little process teaser that shows how \"The Return of Faker\" team created some shots\nBut there's more...\nI firmly believe this is a rare opportunity to take James' love for cartoons from the 80s and his efforts to make The Return of Faker as a vehicle to unpack all of cartoon history, and of course, Filmation. I've been waiting for a great, current day story about 80s cartoons for a long time and to have one that follows an individual who's hellbent and driven beyond any relative rational sense of sanity to most people is RARE. It'll be great if we hit our base goal and showcase how James and his team made The Return of Faker, but it will be special and significant if we can showcase the James' journey to see his childhood dream come true. Specifically, there are NINE key goals that James has and wants to accomplish with \"The Return of Faker\" - and they're all awesome!!!\nThe Return of Faker - Title Screen\nIt's no secret that making films is not a cheap endeavor. Below you will see the projected cost of this film, for the full blown feature length, global release version - which is only a starting point depending how long the journey takes to truly unfold and resolve. On average, documentaries take 3-5 years to shoot, edit and complete. We think our story will resolve sooner than that with delivery around the 2 year mark. \nRob McCallum - Writer/Director, Pyre Productions\nLocked in a tower in parts unknown, Rob McCallum spends his time building elaborate story-driven worlds, playing with action figures, video games or air drumming to some of his favorite tunes.

I'm doing this Kickstarter to pay for the  printing of a new set of tales based on real life mafia events.  Here's one of my favorites:\n\nThe Cal Neva Resort and Casino is a resort and casino straddling the border between Nevada and California on the shores of Lake Tahoe. The original building was constructed in 1926 and was a casino property so colorful that it rivaled Vegas during its heyday.\nOnce gambling came to The Cal Neva in 1928, the property\u2019s state line status became a boon for gambling. If county sheriffs were to raid the lake from  either the California or Nevada side, guests would simply move to  whichever side of the room was safe. \nIn 1960, entertainer Frank Sinatra  purchased the Resort alongside Dean Martin and Chicago mobster Sam Giancana.\nIntroducing Based on a True Story Vol. 3\nCover art by Juan Gomez, colors by Ryan Kroboth.\n\nBased on a True Story Vol. 3 is a 32 page mini comic collection (8.5\" X 5.5\") containing 29 comics, printed in  glorious full color, each based on a real life mobster story.\n\nFor years I have been fascinated with mobsters, but more memorable to me than Hollywood interpretations of the mafia lifestyle are the real life  stories of the Italian American mafia.\n\nWho will love Dust Bunny Mafia?\nFans of mafia-related pop culture like The Godfather, Goodfellas, and The Sopranos.\nLovers of Saturday morning cartoons and the Sunday funny papers.\nPeople who like cartoons such as Looney Tunes and Animaniacs.\nCollectors of high quality independent comic books.\n\nCampaign Exclusives\nLimited edition poker chip\nYour mobimal featured on the back cover line-up\nYour mobimal on the limited edition poker chip\nMobimal Line-up Cameo (Back Cover)\nIn 1932, the press happened to snap a photograph featuring an arrest lineup of Chicago mafia and New York gangsters: Paul 'The Waiter' Ricca, Sylvester  Agoglio, Charles 'Lucky' Luciano, Meyer Lansky, John Senna (Rocco  Fischetti), and Harry Brown. A mobimal modeled after you could be featured in a re-creation of this photograph on the back-cover of the booklet.\nMobimals pictured here are for display purposes only.\n\nLimited Edition Variant Cover - Geoff Munn\nFor Based on a True Story Volume 3, I wanted to do something different, so I commissioned Geoff Munn of  Pocket Science Studios to create a variant cover based on my comic Clam  Up. Geoff knocked it out of the park, creating an image that explains  what happens between panels 2 and 3 of the below Dust Bunny Mafia strip.\n***DOMESTIC U.S. SHIPPING INCLUDED***\nExclusive Story Only to Be Released in This Edition\nOne of the stranger stories that I've adapted in this edition is the story of Aladena \u201cJimmy the Weasel\u201d Fratianno, who was a longtime Mafia hit man and  Los Angeles mob boss before turning into an FBI informant. \nAfter turning  informant, he spent most of his time traveling the country to testify  against fellow mobsters and becoming the highest-paid participant in the  history of the federal witness-protection program. \nLife in retirement  did not always go smoothly, as he sued his hand-picked biographer of his  first book, \u201cThe Last Mafioso,\u201d saying it contained false quotes. He  blamed the second, \u201cVengeance Is Mine,\u201d for his being dropped from the  witness program\u2019s payroll in 1987. \nFratianno gained his nickname from  running \u201clike a weasel\u201d from a pursuing police officer, though, like  Benjamin \u201cBugsy\u201d Siegel, he was seldom called it to his face.\nBased on a True Story T-Shirts\nBased on a True Story T-shirts are Included with several tiers. Below you will find several designs that are parody shirts featuring some well known mafia-related businesses that are featured in this volume.\n\nSchofield's Flowers - Chicago, IL\nSchofield's Flowers was established in 1896 by William F. Schofield, A.K.A. \"Big Bill\". It was located at 738 North State Street on the north side of the city of Chicago.\n\nIn 1921, with only $10,000 dollars and .38 caliber pistol in hand, Dean O'Banion an American mobster of Irish heritage, made \"Big Bill\" Schofield an offer he could not refuse, and they became \"business\" partners. \nThe Chicago North Side Gang transformed Schofield's into the florist of choice for mob funerals, all of the North State Street Gang's weddings, holidays and special occasions, like providing the wreaths for the victims of the Saint Valentine's Day Massacre. \n\nUmberto's Clam House - Manhattan (New York City), NY\n On April 7, 1972, around 4:30 a.m., \u201cCrazy Joe\u201d Gallo and his family entered Umbertos Clam House in Manhattan\u2019s Little Italy to celebrate his  43rd birthday and what would be his last meal. \n\nEarlier that evening, the Gallo party had visited the  Copacabana nightclub to see a performance by comedian Don Rickles and singer Peter  Lemongello. Once at Umbertos, the Gallo party took two tables in the  back corner, with Gallo and his bodyguard Peter \u201cPete the Greek\u201d  Diapoulas facing the wall. \nBetween seafood courses, four gunmen walked into the dining room and opened fire with .32- and .38-caliber revolvers. Gallo swore and attempted to draw his handgun, but twenty shots were  fired at him, and he was hit in the back, elbow and buttock. After overturning a butcher block dining table, Gallo staggered to the front door.  \n\nThe mortally wounded Gallo stumbled into the street and collapsed. He  was taken in a police car to the hospital where he was  pronounced dead shortly after at around 5:30 a.m.\n\nPelican Tomato Company - New Orleans, LA\nInspired by Carlos Marcello, an American crime boss considered to be  the Godfather of New Orleans crime from 1947 until the late 1980s.\n\nCarlos claimed that he was simply a salesman for the Pelican Tomato Company and earned $1500 a month. Despite his illegal profits in motels, restaurants, banks, beer and liquor stores, taxi and bus firms, etc.\nAccording to a Washington Post article in May of 1975, which headline  read, \u201cU.S. Government Buys Produce Linked to Mafia\u201d the Defense  Department bought $1.1 million worth of produce from a firm whose top  salesman was Carlos Marcello, alleged Mafia godfather of New Orleans.\nAlthough responsible government officials privately insist they don\u2019t like doing business with a reputed Mafia boss, they are obliged by law to buy their tomatoes from the lowest bidder.\n\nWhat do people say about the Dust Bunny Mafia? \n***READ BASED ON A TRUE STORY VOL. 1, A DUST BUNNY MAFIA MINI COMIC COLLECTION, FOR FREE BY CLICKING HERE.

Before we get started, I know it's been a really long, strange, difficult 12 months for a lot of us, so I hope everyone is doing okay and staying safe.\nSo... where were we?\nIn the not-too-distant past \u2013 about 6 years ago, November 2015 AD \u2013 we ran a Kickstarter to BRING BACK MST3K after 15 years in hibernation.\nIt was a little bit stressful, and a lot of work, but I've gotta tell you... the whole experience went better than we had ever hoped:\nThanks to you, our campaign broke a bunch of Kickstarter records.\nOver 48,000 of you took up the cause... and together, we raised over $6 million.\nWith your help, we got picked up on Netflix and made 20 new episodes!\nAnd you know, you can't ever please everybody, but it seems like most of you were pretty happy with 'em.... and the critics were too: \nAlso, having those new episodes on Netflix, along with a lot of our \"classic\" episodes, helped a lot of folks discover Mystery Science Theater for the first time. So, if you weren't there to help #BringBackMST3K... Welcome! We're glad you're here to help  #MakeMoreMST3K.\nThanks to our Kickstarter, we also built up enough momentum to experiment with taking MST3K in new directions, including three live national tours, where we got to meet thousands of you in person!  Also, during our live tours, it became really clear to me that MST3K works best when you can experience it together, with your family and friends, or your fellow MSTies.\nAnyway: as you know, nothing good lasts forever.  Sometime in late 2019, during our third live tour, we got word: even though Netflix liked how our new episodes came out, they wouldn't be renewing us for a third new season.\n(Sometimes, business is just business, you know? Was it disappointing not to get renewed? Well, sure. But starting now, we want to focus on looking forward, not back. And when you see what we're planning now, I hope you'll agree that this could end up being the best thing for MST3K in the long run.)\nThen, the day after we finished the live tour, the whole world shut down for a year. And you know, as terrible as COVID has been, it did mean that I had plenty of time to think about where Mystery Science Theater can go next.\nWhen I thought about it long enough, I realized three important things:\n 1. The world isn't done with MST3K yet.\n We still want to make more episodes of MST3K.\nA lot of you still want us to make more MST3K.\n2. It's time to try something new.\nIf enough of you want more MST3K, maybe we don't need anyone to renew us.\nFrom now on, we want you to decide how long MST3K keeps going.\nWe don't need a network to \"let us\" make more MST3K. We can make it for you. \nWhen we do, you should be the first ones to see it.\n3. We need a better space for sharing MST3K, and watching it together.\nWithout a network, we'll need a home for new MST3K, and...\nWe want it to be easy to enjoy MST3K live with other people, so...\nWe need our own online theater for live screenings and events! \nI'm glad you asked, friend... because that's what this new Kickstarter is all about.\nThanks to all of you, Mystery Science Theater 3000 has come a long way since our first Kickstarter.  Now, if you decide to get involved again, here's what we can do next:\n1. MAKE MORE MST3K episodes with a new, sustainable model, that lets you decide how long we should keep going, and lets us bring new episodes directly to you, without depending on a network to distribute or keep renewing us for new seasons.\n2. BUILD THE GIZMOPLEX, our own virtual online theater, where we can host frequent live screenings, premieres, and community events \u2013 and you can host MST3K watch parties with friends whenever you want. More on that in a minute. \nMan... you're way ahead of me. \nIf you were part of our first Kickstarter, this next part might sound familiar:\n If our new Kickstarter can raise at least $2,000,000, we'll be able to make three more new episodes of Mystery Science Theater 3000...but we'll also have enough to build the Gizmoplex. \nAnd then \u2013 just like last time \u2013 the more we raise, the more we can do! Here's what we'll be able to do at each of our goals, all the way up to our final goal of $5.5 million: \nUPDATE (5/8): We hit $6.4M, which means JOEL ROBINSON will return to HOST 2 NEW EPISODES and we'll add a 13TH NEW EPISODE!\nAlso, you know, we don't want to get ahead of ourselves, but if things go well, we've got a lot of other ideas we'd like to add into the mix. You can find out more about that below, and also in this Backer Update.\nNow listen, I hope you're already convinced that the best reason to join our new Kickstarter is because we'll able to #MakeMoreMST3K and #BuildTheGizmoplex.\nBut since this is Kickstarter, let's talk about REWARDS.\nI'm really proud of how most of the rewards from our first Kickstarter campaign turned out, and ever since then, a lot of you told me how much you loved them too. So, this time around, I want to do our best to \"raise the bar.\" You'll have to decide for yourself if we pull it off, but I'll tell you that we've got a few rewards this time that I'm really excited about \u2013 especially the Gizmoplex DIY Concession Pack, our new Challenge Coins, and a pretty amazing design for an MST3K Musical Snow Globe! \nUPDATE \u2013 Since there are so many rewards to keep track of, and we want to make sure you know what to expect in each pledge level, we've also put together this chart, which has been UPDATED to include the ALL-DIGITAL EXPERIMENT 85! \nSo yeah, as you can see, until you get above Experiment 500, most of the rewards \"stack\", which means you get all of the rewards listed in all of the lower pledge levels,  not just the new rewards listed with each pledge level. And unless it says otherwise, all reward levels above Experiment 500 include everything listed on this chart. I'm telling you, it's a lot of cool stuff. \nUPDATE (MAY 5): Joel has shared some \"sneak peek\" images of the designs for our new rewards, including TWO T-SHIRT DESIGNS, TWO POSTER DESIGNS, the MUSICAL SNOWGLOBE and the just-released MISSION PATCHES!\n FIRST LOOK: T-SHIRT DESIGNS \nFIRST LOOK: POSTER DESIGNS \nFIRST LOOK: MUSICAL SNOWGLOBE \nYou can read more about the Musical Snowglobe in this Backer Update, but you should know that it will have a \"wind-up\" mechanical element in the base which plays a new rendition of the MST3K Theme Song, composed just for this reward by Paul Sabourin:\nFIRST LOOK: NEW MISSION PATCH (ADD-ON) \nAlso, one big change since last time is that we're now able to offer \"Add-On Rewards\" right here on Kickstarter. That means that we don't have to guess exactly what you'll like, or create a million different confusing pledge levels. \nHere are some of the Add-On Rewards available right now:\n\n SHIPPING NOT INCLUDED!\nAlso, just in case you missed the notice in the description of each reward level: We're not collecting shipping costs for any rewards until after the Kickstarter ends.\nAbout 2-4 weeks after our Kickstarter campaign ends, you'll get a reward survey to give us all of the details we need, like your t-shirt size, or the name(s) you want us to use for each of the \"Special Thanks\" rewards. When you give us those details, we'll also collect shipping for any rewards that go in the mail!\nREWARD TIMING\nWhile a handful of rewards \u2013 like the \"MST3K Season 13: Collector's Box Set\" on DVD and Blu-Ray \u2013 might not be available until as late as June 2022, other rewards \u2013 like Weekly Production Updates \u2013 will start within just a few weeks of when our Kickstarter campaign ends. So, don't let the \"June 2022\" delivery date scare you. Kickstarter just asks us to list the latest date when we expect all rewards to be sent out.\nNow, I know this is already a lot of information, especially if you already watched our video, and I think I've told you most of the really important stuff.\nAnd, if you still want more information, there's a lot more detail below, so keep reading if you want to know more about...\nHow the Gizmoplex will work!\nHow the Gizmoplex can make MST3K better! \nHow we set our funding goals!\nHow we'll spend whatever we raise!\nAlso, one of the things I like best about Kickstarter is that it's not just a \"monologue,\" but a really great way to have a conversation with all of you who care about the show. So, if there are other things you want to know about, I hope you'll take a look at our FAQ... and if the answer isn't there, I hope you'll ask!\nWe'll also do our best to read and respond to all of your comments. But just so you know, I'm pretty sure that our first Kickstarter also got more comments than any project that came before it! So, if that happens again, please be patient if it takes us a little while to get to everything. We've got a whole month, and a lot more to tell you!\nThere's one more thing I need to say before you go, and it's pretty important:\nOver the last year, as I was trying to imagine where Mystery Science Theater can go next, I also spent a lot of time thinking about how we got here.\n(It's kind of crazy to realize that it's been almost six years since our first Kickstarter, and almost thirty-three years since we first aired on KTMA on Thanksgiving in 1988.)\nAnyway, when I look back on everything that's happened, it's really clear that our first Kickstarter was one of the defining moments in Mystery Science history. For our first campaign, we asked you to help us make new episodes, and to prove to \"the networks\" that there was still an audience for MST3K... and you did!\nBut together, we've done a lot more than that. Thanks to you, Mystery Science Theater has been able to produce 2 new seasons, 20 new episodes, 6 comic books, 3 live national tours, and 1 record-breaking Kickstarter.\nToday, I hope you'll join us again to write MST3K's next chapter: to prove that we can #MakeMoreMST3K without depending on a network to keep us alive, and to #BuildTheGizmoplex, a unique online theater where MST3K can continue to grow.\nBut \u2013 and this is the important part \u2013 I also want to be cautious. We're all just crawling out from COVID, and it's been a difficult year. I know that things are more difficult for a lot of people than they were during our first Kickstarter. If you decide to pledge, please: only give what feels comfortable, even if it's just a few bucks. And if you can't afford anything, that's okay too! We'll find other ways for you to stay involved, and to make sure you can still get access to all of our new episodes and Gizmoplex events.\nThat's all: more than anything, please just take care of yourself... and if you can't help out right now, don't think twice about it. We'll still be here when you're ready.\nI guess that's everything, so... we've got 30 days. Let's see how this thing goes.\nCheers & Thanks,\nJoel\n\n\nHey, you're still here. So, I guess you want more details, huh?\nOh yeah, that's right. Thanks for reminding me.\nI think the Gizmoplex might be the biggest \"new idea\" we're working with this time around, so there are a lot of details and possibilities I'm excited to share with you as we go. Here's what you should know right away.\nHaving a Gizmoplex All-Access Pass has three important benefits:\n1. Live Premieres & Events: The Gizmoplex will host at least TWO LIVE EVENTS EVERY MONTH for our first year, where you can join me, our cast and writers, and some special surprise guests. Each event will be like a night at the theater, and will have a lot of fun surprises. Some of our ideas include theme nights hosted by our cast and special guests, live commentaries, and maybe even live riffing! Also, we won't just screen episodes: it'll be a real show, and could include new sketches, trailers (done \"MST3K style\"), live Q&A panel discussions, interviews, contests... and the return of the MST3K \"viewer mail\" segment! (And yes, if you can't make one, you'll be able to see it after.)\n2. The MST3K Watch Club: To make it easier to watch MST3K with your friends, the Gizmoplex will also be the official home of the MST3K Watch Club! Each month, you'll get on-demand access to a new selection of episodes, and the ability to host your own live screenings for up to 10 people! Anyone with a Gizmoplex Pass can join for free, and if you want to invite someone who doesn't, they can get a \"Day Pass\" for just $0.99!\n3. Gizmoplex Apps: Since we reached our second goal ($3.3M) we'll be able to develop apps that bring the Gizmoplex to mobile devices and TVs! Right now, the plan is to include apps for six of the most popular platforms: iOS, Android, AppleTV, AndroidTV, FireTV and Roku. And no promises, but we're also looking into apps for XBOX, PlayStation and Samsung TVs. Like Crow says: we're gonna conquer cyberspace, man! (Read more about the apps here.)\nSo, if you think about it, we think it's a pretty different model than we could pull off anywhere else. I really want the Gizmoplex to feel like something new: less like another Netflix with nothing but MST, and more like a charming, off the radar, suburban cineplex that plays movies for 99 cents, long after their first run.\nIf we get this right, the Gizmoplex Pass won't just give you a monthly subscription to a catalog of MST3K episodes, or a place to watch the episodes you own on-demand: it'll be more like a \"Season Pass\" that gives you tickets to every show at your favorite theater: front row, opening night, every time. Take that, Moviepass!\nYou can read a LOT more about our plans for the Gizmoplex in this Backer Update.\nAlso, even though this won't make a lot of sense until I give you more details, there's one more thing I want you to understand:\nThe Gizmoplex won't just be our new online theater and event space. It's also going to be an important new location that The Mads are creating on the show, and inside the world of Mystery Science Theater, as their next step toward world domination: the first cineplex on the moon!\nAnyway, I think it'll all make sense when you see it... but until then, remember, \u201cIt\u2019s just a show, I should really just relax.\u201d\nSo, there you have it: in a nutshell, this is what we want to do. After 33 years, it's time for Mystery Science \"Theater\" to have an actual (virtual) theater that MSTies can call their own. It's time... to #BuildTheGizmoplex.\nAny other questions?\nOh, wait. I think I know what you're going to ask. \nJust like last time, I'm sure some of you are wondering, so go ahead and ask. \nI knew that's what you were gonna ask! And since we're asking you to pledge some of your hard-earned money \u2013 especially after a difficult year \u2013 I want to be really open and transparent about this. So, let's break this down a little bit.\n1. Without a network supporting us, we need to fund everything ourselves. During our first Kickstarter, we estimated that, once production was up and running, we'd be able to produce new episodes for about $250K each. In the end, though, the budget for each new episode ended up being closer to $350K. For the last two seasons, we were able to cover the difference through our deal with Netflix... but this time, we're on our own. We've got a lot of ways we can keep the budget lower, but, you know... it's still going to cost something. And when you think about it, $350K for 90 minutes of television is still one of the best deals in show business.\n2. We still can't spend everything we raise on Kickstarter to make the show.\nCampaign Fees: Between Kickstarter and the credit card processor, we pay about 8% of your pledge in fees. There's also a fee for CrowdOx, the platform we'll use to manage all of your surveys and rewards after the campaign ends.\nMaking Rewards: We reserve about 20% of your pledge in order to design, produce, print, sort and pack all of your rewards. And that's not even including shipping, which we're not collecting until after our Kickstarter campaign ends!\nDedicated Support: During our first Kickstarter, we underestimated the amount of work involved in providing customer support and creating detailed backer updates, so we had to depend on volunteers to do a lot of it. This time, we want to make sure we're prepared, so we budgeted about 4% of each pledge for that.\nBuilding & Running the Gizmoplex: We really want the Gizmoplex to be great, but getting it started will take some work \u2013 and keeping it running also means we'll have some monthly fees to cover. We also need some budget to support all of the special live events we're planning to host. So, we're using about 3% of your pledge for that.\nWhen you put it all together, we have to spend about 35% of what we raise just to cover Kickstarter expenses, and to keep all the promises we're making to you.\n\n3. The more episodes we make, the less each one costs! Like we explained during our first Kickstarter, the basic idea is pretty simple: for some parts of production, we have to spend the same amount up front, no matter how many episodes we're making.\nFor example, let's say that our writers realize the show needs a custom-built oversized rubber chicken. No matter how many episodes we have, it's going to cost $1000 to make. So, if we only use it in three episodes, we have to spend $333 per episode on a rubber chicken. But, if we use the chicken in twelve episodes, that $1000 goes a lot farther, and our rubber chicken kaiju only costs us $83 for each episode. Make sense?\n     Based on those numbers, you can see that the cost for each episode gets lower as the number of episodes goes up:\nSo yeah, just like our first Kickstarter, I know that a fair number of you won't care about these types of details... but since some of you will, we want to be as clear as possible.\n1. KEEP CIRCULATING THE URL. Back in the day, MST3K wasn\u2019t seen nationwide and we encouraged people to record the shows on VHS and send them to their friends and loved ones. It was our version of \u201cI Want My MTV.\u201d Every episode of MST3K ended with a message that encouraged MSTies to \u201cKeep Circulating the Tapes,\u201d and you guys did. Then, in our last Kickstarter, we updated that to \"Keep Circulating the URL,\" and you did that too. Now, we've got a new URL, so we're asking you again:\n2. FOLLOW @MST3K ON SOCIAL MEDIA. Be sure you're following our account on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and YouTube. Those are one of our best ways to keep everyone up-to-date on what's going on, so encourage your fellow MSTies to follow them too! We really appreciate it, and we couldn\u2019t do it without you. You\u2019re like our virtual street team!\n3. CIRCULATE THE MESSAGE FROM EACH UPDATE. From now until our Kickstarter ends on May 7, most of the backer updates that we send will include a suggested message or image. Copy, paste, and post them on your own social accounts to help spread the word. It's as simple as that! \n4. CHECK IN WITH YOUR FELLOW MSTIES.  We don't want you to pressure anyone, but we do hope you'll check in to make sure they know about this Kickstarter.  And when you do, be sure to remind them that pledging even a $1 token pledge will still help us unlock more Challenge Goals, Bonus Rewards, and get them weekly updates all the way through the production of Season 13!\n5. JOIN OUR \"VIRTUAL STREET TEAM.\" If you've got a little extra time, and want to make sure we reach our final goal, there are more specific ways to volunteer and help. If you want to get specific \"assignments\" to help us #MakeMoreMST3K, you can sign up to be part of our elite volunteer team.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs we learned last time, there are always risks with Kickstarter... and the world is a little crazier right now than usual.

REACHED!\n\nBOSTON METAPHYSICAL SOCIETY needs your help to print our new story, THE BOOK OF DEMONS (41 page story in a 48 page perfect bound book) and produce our NEW PLAGUE DOCTOR LAPEL PIN!\nHere's our cover:\n\nWho will love Boston Metaphysical Society?\nFans of Penny Dreadful, Girl Genius, Ruse, steampunk and gaslamp fantasy stories.\nPeople who like to read paranormal, historical fiction, and/or alternate history.\nIf you like character-driven comics with a mix of paranormal and science fiction, then these are the comics for you!\nTHE STORY\nWhen Erin, Caitlin\u2019s mother, discovers her daughter can control a demon, she is outraged. In her mind, only a Great House has the right to such power, but who will listen to a poor Irish woman? House Lowell will. For Alice Lowell has inherited an old Puritan journal which describes how to find and enslave a demon, but she needs a psychic to do it. Kidnapping Caitlin is the first step in a plan to rid her husband\u2019s House of debt. But with a demon to do their bidding, her ambitions will be limitless.\nThe Book of Demons can be read as a standalone, but it is a continuation of Ghosts and Demons.\nFirst Three Pages:\nNEW TO BOSTON METAPHYSICAL SOCIETY?\nIf you are new to the series, the original six issue mini-series is about an ex-Pinkerton detective, a spirit photographer, and a genius scientist who battle supernatural forces in late 1800\u2019s Boston. They  live in an alternate steampunk history where ghosts and demons are a normal part of life. Families known as the Great Houses control the economy of the Great States of America while the middle class and lower classes sole purpose are to serve the Great Houses.\nThe original trade paperback is available in several reward tiers.\nWHAT'S IN THE TRADE?\nI'm glad you asked. Not only does it include all six issues from the  original mini-series as well as the cover art, but it also contains a  ten page  short story called, Hunter-Killer,  and additional bonus pages. With art by Emily Hu and coloring by Gloria Caeli, the story is set at the beginning of the House Wars (my version of the American Civil War) and features the crew of a prototype airship.  I introduce three new characters: Gwen Warrick - Captain;  Emmet Rochester - Navigator; and Joaquin Medina - Engineer.\nThe complete sequential art version of Hunter-Killer will ONLY be available in the trade.\nWHAT ELSE IS THERE?\nOur three previous standalone sequels will be available as well. And they are:\nTHE SCOURGE OF THE MECHANICAL MEN \nSTORY: Granville and Tesla are in a race for time to save Boston from a mysterious disease that turns human beings into machines.\n\nTHE SPIRIT OF REBELLION \n STORY: Caitlin flees to Philadelphia only to discover a ghost, a rebellion, and perhaps, her destiny.\n\nGHOSTS AND DEMONS \n STORY:  A disturbing dream leads Caitlin and the team to face off with a new enemy.\nTHE BOSTON METAPHYSICAL SOCIETY COLORING BOOK:\nTwenty (20) gorgeous illustrations for you to relax  and color away to your heart's content. Includes illustrations of  Samuel, Granville, Caitlin, Tesla, Houdini, and more! It will be an 8  1/2 x 11 book and is suitable for all ages. Art by Alejandro Lee\nOTHER REWARDS\nIn addition to THE BOOK OF DEMONS, we are offering the trade paperback, the anthology Boston Metaphysical Society: Prelude, the first novel set in this universe, Boston Metaphysical Society: A Storm of Secrets, plus a NEW PLAGUE DOCTOR LAPEL PIN. It is 1 inch in diameter and will be an antique bronze color. (Designed by Alejandro Lee.)\nLapel Pin Set\nA set of SEVEN Boston Metaphysical pins (Plague Doctor, Bowler Hat, Teapot, Dirigible, Tesla, 1800's Box Camera, and Triquetra) in a lovely gift box with our logo are available as well. (As long as supplies last.)\nBOSTON METAPHYSICAL SOCIETY: A STORM OF SECRETS\nThe award winning novel, BOSTON METAPHYSICAL SOCIETY: A STORM OF SECRETS, is a prequel to the original graphic novel though it can be read as a standalone. It takes place five years prior to the original series.\nIt was awarded a Silver Medal as well as The Write Companion Award for Best Overall TOP PICK - Adult, Children's and Young Adult categories in the 2019 Feathered Quill Book Awards.\nStory: As the Great Houses of Boston jockey for power, an ex-Pinkerton detective, his psychic wife, and his father-in-law must contend with treachery, subterfuge, and a new supernatural threat, in this political and supernatural thriller set in an alternate-history Boston of 1890.\nThe award winning cover is by Luisa Preissler. Title Graphics by Anke Koopman.\n\nAnd if you haven't read Boston Metaphysical Society: Prelude yet, then this would be the perfect time to get it. This anthology of short stories and novellas includes stories of how Granville and Samuel met and their first case together; what set Caitlin on her path; and how Samuel met his wife, Elizabeth Weldsmore Hunter. Several reward tiers  include it as either a pdf or print version.\nThe Underground - A Boston Metaphysical Society Short Story (Available as an Add-on for all tiers and is already included in the Granville Woods and All Things BMS tiers.) \nIn The Underground,  Andrew O'Sullivan takes his young daughter, Caitlin, on a case that might reveal a past and a potential future neither of them expected. This is a prose story and is available in Epub or mobi formats. (Previously published in Last Stop on the #13.)\nNEW REWARD TIER!\nSPECIAL COMMISSION REWARD TIER (KICKSTARTER EXCLUSIVE)\nEver wanted to time travel?

My stalwart shipping envelopes met their match at USPS, so this year I will be using the ULINE S-165 cardboard mailers (or their equivalent) along with boards and extra packing material for anything outside of California (and probably in California as well.) Those who order the Nothing But Books and All Things BMS will get the usual sturdy cardboard box as those have worked well in the past.\nINTERNATIONAL SHIPPING: We were able to obtain discounted international postage for over 55 countries this year. I have passed on those savings to you depending on your shipping address. To extend these savings even further, for those who pledge to the Nothing But Books or the All Things BMS, and it is shipped to one of those 55 countries, we will be splitting up the rewards into two boxes in order for you to receive the discount. \nTHE TEAM FOR THE SEQUELS:\nMadeleine Holly-Rosing - Writer/Creator: A   TV, feature film, comic book writer, and novelist, Madeleine holds an   MFA in Screenwriting from UCLA where she won numerous awards as well as  the Sloan Fellowship.

Inspired by fantasy and the art of storytelling,   Holly-Rosing uses her imagination to create a fantastic story that is   both well-written and fearless.\" - Valerie Complex (Fansided)\n\"If you have a taste for an intelligent, well written, elegantly   illustrated award winning independent book, you can't go wrong with   Boston Metaphysical Society!\" - Alex Yarde (The Good Man Project)\n\"This very inventive series posits a totally believable Steampunk   world that is populated by appealing characters who act (and react) in   believable manners to the extraordinary events that swirl around them.\"  -  Robert Sodaro (Comic Reviewer at Examiner.com)\nTHE STORY BEHIND THE STORY\nI love writing BOSTON METAPHYSICAL SOCIETY.  Not only does it bring my  love of science fiction and history  together, (which by the way, equals  steampunk), the steampunk time  period allows me to address the themes  of classism, sexism, and racism  in America in a thoughtful and engaging  way. For at its very core,  BOSTON METAPHYSICAL SOCIETY is an American  story. And you can't tell an  American story without including women and  people of color.\nIt has been and always will be important to me to write characters  who, though they come from diverse backgrounds and have different  points  of view, are able to work together for the common good.\nADD-ONS\nI have decided not to use the option of Kickstarter add-ons during this campaign, though I will be using Backerkit when I send out the surveys if you'd like to add anything to your pledge.\nSTRETCH GOALS\nSTRETCH GOAL #1 - $5,700 - (KICKSTARTER EXCLUSIVE) **REACHED!**\nBackers who have pledged $10 or more to a physical reward will  receive  this wonderful 8 1/2 x 11 inch print on 10 pt. cardstock gloss  by the  amazing Ashley Woods. \nAshley has worked for Marvel, Dark Horse, IDW, and Stranger Comics (Niobe).

Kipo and The Age Of The Wonderbeasts.\nVideogames like: The Legend of Zelda. World of Warcraft, Skyrim, Witcher, God of War\nMy main goals for this project have been to Introduce the world to powerful stories and the legends of Aotearoa. Leave a resource to help normalise Te Reo (The Maori Language) globally and within NZ homes and to make it part of the everyday language for young Kiwi kids to absorb. Raise enough money for lettering for issue 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat do mean you don\u2019t know your history?\u201d I had just completed the UK citizenship test and realised not a single one of my Uk friends could have passed this. How was that possible?\nHow did the NZ school system teach me better about British history than theirs had!\nHang on a minute.\nI didn\u2019t know my NZ history either.\nWhy was that?\nMy recollection of M\u0101ori legends was limited to picture books in primary school.\nI had virtually no grasp of Te Reo (the Maori language) aside from kia ora /Hello and kapai/Thankyou so why was that?\nLooking at Aotearoa/NZ from afar I see so many potential opportunities where my younger self could have been exposed and educated in the history of my country rather than it been given lip service and more than often treated with conscious/unconscious racism.\nI'm interested in telling stories that show M\u0101ori myths and legends' as important to the identity of all New Zealanders whether we're M\u0101ori, P\u0101keha, or Tauiwi.\nSo I created a new world where our people are using the lessons and legends of the past to guide them (literally in some cases) to a better tomorrow.\nI grew up with Tintin and Asterix books and somehow still remember French and Latin words from those books and believe that comics are the perfect medium to subtly introduce Te Reo M\u0101ori for another generation.\nNot only for the children of New Zealand but potentially for a global audience as well.\nThat Book is THIS LAND\n2020 was difficult for everyone. I have worked hard my collaborators to find solutions to get the book to completion and we now have 5 issues completely inked and ready for colouring and lettering.\nThe good news is Issue 1 is complete!\nIssue 2 is coloured!\nIssue 3/4/5 are inked!\nIn 2019 we had 2 successful print runs of Issue 1 in the UK and sold almost 1000 copies.\nWe have refined the book and added 4 additional pages of story to give YOU the reader the best bang for your back and elevate the story to the next level!\nKickstarter Fees\nShipping and Packaging\nNew Print Run\nLettering for Issue 2 plus a few lettering changes for issue 1 (new pages)\nColouring for Issue 3\n\n\n\n\nNOTE: NOT FINAL LETTERING\n\nCHECK OUT THE ORIGINAL ART AVAILABLE BY CLICKING HERE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome things to remember - \n1) Pledge early and help spread the word, as this helps our Kickstarter stay at the top of the projects list longer and will also helps our endeavour to reach our goal.\n\n2) The more we make the more you get. If we are able to reach our goal and beyond our stretch goals then we will load you guys up with some extras.\n\n3) You are not charged until the end of the Kickstarter so pledging early doesn't mean you will be charged straight away.\n\n4) We are always here to answer any questions. The team will always be on hand to answer any questions which include add on's, specials and anything else about the project or story.\n\n\nSo what are you waiting for?\nBack us today and be part of History!\nWe will be successful!\nThe earlier you back the earlier you can help us unlock some extra stretch goals and goodies for everyone!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nNone! \nIssue 1 is complete!\nissue 2 is coloured\nIssue 3,4& 5 are inked!\n\nFor a sneak peek of the remaining 5 issues art go to http://www.arohacomics.com and sign up to our newsletter for access to our Colouring book/preview of the entire series!! (Also included for each pledge)\n\nAs a Kickstarter backer myself, I know how much it means to ask you to support a new project with your hard earned money.\n\n I've made every effort to minimize any risk to you as a potential backer before launching this campaign. Part of this endeavor was making sure the first issue was 100% complete so that when (with your help) the campaign is successful, files can be uploaded to the printer immediately and digital files will ship to backers upon receiving the completed surveys. \n \n I have already been in contact with multiple printers and have chosen to go with Rich at Comic Printing UK , who have already done a fantastic job on the First print run and is the go to man for Independent comics in the UK\n\nIn New Zealand we are working with Jason and his team at Beyond the Ledge Press in Christchurch who\nare ready to hit the presses should we need upon the campaign's completion. \n\nThere are already 28 copies of the First printing in New Zealand Randy to go out.\nThe only thing holding those back is the distributor (Mum!) will be heading back from visiting Australia and will be in quarantine hotel for 14 days!\n \n This campaign will be my first Kickstarter, so I will not claim to be an expert, but I have made every effort to educate and surround myself with knowledgeable individuals who have run successful Kickstarter campaigns in the past. Including attending Tyler James & Jeremy Melloul's ComixLaunch Course (http://pro.comixlaunch.com) for creating a successful Kickstarter campaign. \n \n This project is close to my heart, and my goal is to make sure that every backer leaves this experience satisfied and eagerly looking forward to the next instalment of THIS LAND. \n \n If you have any questions or concerns that I may not have covered, please feel free to message me.

What if you had the power of a GOD?"}}, {"backer": "Mark Wiesner", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": " Mia Raven. The thief who became a detective who became a thief, \nonly this time she steals from crooks.\n Mia Raven: swarthy, strong-willed woman who cares less about the law than she does recovering stolen items. Mia Raven: gun-toting feminist icon with a troubled past, bad attitude and tattered psyche. Mia Raven: CEO and founder of Recovery Incorporated, a company that will help you get your (valuable) stolen item back when the police can't. Or won't. For a hefty price, of course.\nRecovery Incorporated is a 24 page, over-sized 9x12 inch European formatted comic, part 1 in a 4 issue mini-series.\n My name is Michael Penick and I've been a professional artist and writer for over twenty years now, a freelancer in the advertising, film, illustration, comic book, motion graphics, and interface design industries. A jack of all trades, really, but my first love has always been visual storytelling, and at 51, I'm tired of letting all the stories I've been developing and writing languish alone in my imagination and on my computer. \nThanks to all the wonderful and generous support I've received so far, its time to interrupt this regularly scheduled kickstarter page and introduce some stretch goals! If so many stretch goals seem generous, then you're just going to have to live with it! \ud83d\ude09 I'm so grateful for how my campaign has gone so far that I want to help you get as much extra stuff as I can!  \n Recovery Incorporated - Another Day At The Office marks the beginning of my journey to bring those stories to you. It's the first of a four issue mini-series. I've been working on issue 02 since the beginning of the year. If you'd like to keep up with my progress, you can sign up for my newsletter here.\nThe first issue of Recovery Incorporated is finished. In fact, it's been finished since 2012! I was hired, at the time, to create a story for a British magazine. I brought my long time friend and writing partner Dean Deckard along with me to help in the creation process. The story would unfold in eight page increments each month. \n Unfortunately, the financier of the magazine, who lived in Eastern Europe, had trouble getting funds to the UK, which meant the editor there couldn't get funds to me! In light of that, I felt i had no choice but to stop my comic from running in the magazine. It was only a few months later that the entire magazine folded. It was a sad, but not uncommon affair, in the comics world.\nI \"shelved\" the story at the time because, well, I really needed to find work and make up for the months I had just spent working for no pay, but I also felt it wasn't really something American comic book readers would be into. In the time between then and now, however, the independent comic book market in the US has truly flourished, as has the Kickstarter platform. So here I am.\n Because I've been around. Ive seen what the publishing world looks like and what the contracts look like. I think, more and more, that Kickstarter is the future of comics and, potentially, publishing. I think this is the place to be. Even with an industry publisher I'd have to do my own marketing if i really wanted my book to be successful, so why not just do the rest of the work while I'm at it? And if I'm really, brutally honest with you, my ADD makes it easier for me to work for myself than under the deadlines imposed by the comic book industry most of the time. I'm a self-motivated guy - I don't require artificial stimulation to motivate me. Kickstarter provides me with the one link that was missing in my ability to complete my own production chain.\nTo answer that, let me ask yet another question: what makes Mia Raven different from all the other Femme Fatales you've seen in recent years? A lot of things. \n First off, she's a thief, not a spy. \n Second, she's into using her brains far more than she is using guns or sex. \n Third, unlike other people in the modern world of storytelling (think storytellers whose names rhyme with Bay Bay Haybrams), I like to plan ahead - I know what happens to Mia through each of the 4 planned story arcs. I know her character arc from before issue 01 begins through where we leave her on the final page of her saga. \n     You know what allows me to do? It allows me to put clues in issue 01 for which you won't see a payoff for another 10 issues. Those are the kinds of stories I love reading, so those are the kinds of stories I endeavor to write. \n I also like to do my research. Everything you'll find in these stories - every piece of tech, every security system or vehicle or any other such thing - either exists or is technically plausible. I love science, so I love to get it in wherever I can. I also hate when stories do ridiculous stuff I know is impossible - I don't write 80s Bond films, okay? \ud83d\ude09 \n     To up the ante even further, I served in the army, in the infantry, for a little over 4 years. I fast-roped out of Black Hawks, skydived out of all manner of military aircraft (even at night), trudged through the jungle on moonless nights wearing NVGs with an IR laser attached to my rifle - I got to do a lot of high speed stuff in my 4 years, stuff that not only allow me to bring a lot of knowledge and accuracy to my stories, but authenticity to my characters and the things I put them through.\n I've just shown you the first eight pages of my comic. Why? Because this is like the opening scene in Raiders of the Lost Ark - it introduces you to the character and the kind of thing she does, but the actual plot of this story doesn't begin until the next page.\n     One thing you might notice about Recovery Incorporated is that it's not drawn to typical American comic book proportions. It was commissioned for european standards, which I love, so that's the way I plan to print it. That means Recovery Incorporated will be printed at 9x12 inches, making my comic as wide as typical American comics are tall. I want the work to be presented the size it was intended to be shown. Not only will you be getting a larger comic than normal, but you're getting more story per page than typical American comics. There's plenty of story left in 16 pages, and I plan on having issue 2 ready to go once you get issue 01 in your hands. \n     A word of caution, however...\n     While there's no nudity in Recovery Incorporated, there's adult language and reference to adult situations. This isn't for kids. It would be irresponsible for me to not let you know that up front.\n     So what are early readers saying about the first issue of Recovery Incorporated?\n Andy Jenkins - \"It's a polished book with some really fluid dynamic art and well thought out panel and page structure... it's exciting, builds up the characters well and has enough little twists and turns to keep you reading and looking forward to the next issue.\"\nRandy Stone - \"I knew going in that with Michael Penick's art, this would be a great looking book, but I was equally impressed with the story he did with co-writer Dean Deckard. The ideas were fun and the pace was exciting. This is a blockbuster on the page!\"\nMark Freeman - \"Recovery Incorporated is everything I love about independent comic books. The story itself is fresh and different. The characters are written as real people with real-world issues. The artwork is crisp, clean and easy to follow, while the writing has layers of complexity. This makes for a fun and engaging read. I can\u2019t wait to see what happens next.\"\nDanny Gorny - \"The action is compelling. It's a pleasure to read a globetrotting heist story with such an elegant setup. The art and colouring are great - featuring excellent use of dramatic shots during the exposition scenes, and the backgrounds and setting are exciting. The colouring choices, especially during the flashbacks, is inspired.\"\nGabriel Hernandez - \"Recovery Incorporated starts strong and gets stronger with each page. It's a refreshing update to  the 'Gentleman Thief' legend for the 21st Century.\"\nI'm not asking for a lot. I'm keeping it simple because I want this to succeed. If i can pass my funding goal, I'll shoot for some simple stretch goals like a nicer cover stock and a couple of other things I'll introduce later in the campaign. What I am asking for is covered in the graphic here:\nAs you can see, there's nothing fancy here. No thrills, no frills - nothing outside what it costs to run this campaign, print the books, and get them to you.\nHere's what you can expect from me once the campaign has ended. You can see the plan right here; I'll keep backers up to date as each step here comes to pass so you'll know everything is going as scheduled. If there are any hiccups, I'll let got know immediately and tell you how that will affect the schedule.\n2/11 - Campaign ends \n2/26 - Receive funds from Kickstarter \n3/1 - Place ptint order\n3/15 - Receive print order at my house \n3/29 - All orders packed and shipped\n5/23 - Domestic orders received by mail\nMedia mail can take 8 weeks to arrive - that's why the long shipping window. Many packages may arrive quicker than that, but I'd rather have you're package arrive earlier than I told you than later. During this time I will be busting my hump to get issue 02 pencilled, inked, colored, and ready to go so that I can launch the campaign for issue 02 right on the heels of you getting issue 01 in your hands. If you want to follow my progress along the way, my newsletter is the best place to do it! If you missed it before, you can sign up for it here.\nI'm offering three covers for my first issue of Recovery Incorporated. The main cover, drawn by me, will be used everywhere. The two alternate covers will only be available here on Kickstarter, possibly only during this one campaign. I will never offer them anywhere else - that's a promise. So let me show you the covers:\n     As I mentioned before, my longtime friend and co-writer Dean Deckard helped me create Mia Raven and the story that covers this first mini-series. We\u2019ve been the closest of friends for 30 years now. We challenge each other over everthing, make each other think, and work well as writing partners because neither of us care about ego. All we care about is story.\n     My only other collaborator on this issue was the Eisner award winning colorist John Rauch. I can't begin to tell you what a joy it is to get pages back from John. I've worked with him on several projects and never once have I had to fret over a single thing. Its like he reads my mind, but more clearly than I can. My biggest hope for this campaign, in fact, is that I can raise enough funds to hire him to color issue 02 for me as I get the pages ready - that will allow me to get issue 02 to you in the shortest time frame possible. That's one of those stretch goals I mentioned a second ago.\n     Now let's take a look at the pledge levels I'm offering up. I've tried to keep them as simple and easy to understand as I could. \n Update: Funding goal bonus reward - all backers at every level will now receive free access to an audio commentary of me talking my way through issue 01 as both a writer and an artist \nAllow me to take a moment and explain the \"Prior Work Bundle\" limitation. I don't have 10 bundles in reach of the three tiers I'm offering it in, I have ten total. If a person pledges for one in one tier, it reduces their availability in all three tiers together. To reiterate: I only have 10 Prior Work Bundles in total. \nOn top of these support tiers, you can add any of the following items to your pledges (in case you're wanting to build your order in a way I haven't thought of in the tiers, want more of one thing, or even two forms of original art):\nFor the sketch cards, pin-ups, original pages of art, and covers, I will contact each person in the order that they pledged to choose which piece of art they want from the available choices. \nThank you so much for your time, and, if I get your support, for helping me get this ball rolling. You are an essential element of my future and I value you more than I can say. Every day when i get up and work, I will endeavor to make sure i have given you more than your money's worth.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs far as risks and challenges go, the book is ready to go to the printer, which I've already chosen, and is here in the US, so turn around time will be quick. I'll pay for insurance on the shipping so if anything were to happen, I'll be covered to get another print run done. That just leaves getting your packages to you. I've taken lessons from the most experienced kickstarters and have gotten the best materials to make sure your books reach you as safely and perfectly as possible, and while this is only my first kickstarter, I've been a professional artist and writer delivering jobs on time for over 20 years now - you don't stay in business if you don't communicate well, get your work done, and delivered on time.

You can also order the graphic novels from the Godsverse as well.*** \nThe Godverse takes my two most popular graphic novels, Katrina Hates the Dead/Katrina Hates Dead Shit and Pixie Dust, novelizes them, and adds FIFTEEN additional stories set across 13,000 years to fill in the mythology about how we moved from polytheism to monotheism, why the gods abandoned us, and why the universe feels like a chaotic mess with no rhyme, reason, or order.\nThese books are exciting, action-adventure mythological fantasy novels steeped in mythology, then filled with humor, action, conflict, and fun.\nThese novels will come as paperback books, while the graphic novels and anthologies will come as hardcover books.\nWhat is the Godsverse?\nThe Godsverse is a universe where all gods are real, but they are kind of useless dicks, just like the old gods from mythology.\nI could get the ethos behind those gods. They aren't all-powerful, all-knowing, or all benevolent. They just kind of sucked, like the humans they ruled. Those gods made a lot of sense based on how the world has devolved recently.\nIn the Godsverse, when a new habitable world is formed, all the gods from all pantheons come to make sure that it's functional and sustainable. They help humanity, fragile and weak creatures, flourish in the harsh universe.\nThat's why there were so many god sightings in the past, and not many at all right now.\nThey abandoned us.\nOnce a world is sustainable, then the gods move on to the next world, leaving one god in charge as regent.\nSome gods are good rulers. Some are not so great. Others downright suck.   \nThe Godsverse is funny fantasy, with mythological and action thriller tendencies. It is fast-paced, full of plot twists, and will keep you on the edge of your seat...when you aren't falling off of it laughing.\nReviews of the Godsverse Chronicles\nDon't take it from me that it's awesome, though. After all, I am biased. Here are some reviews from fellow readers. \nWho am I?\nMy name is Russell Nohelty, USA Today bestselling author and publisher of Wannabe Press, a small press that creates weird books for weird people, creator of Katrina Hates Dead Shit, Ichabod Jones Monster Hunter, and Pixie Dust, along with the editor of both the Monsters and Other Scary Shit, and Cthulhu is Hard to Spell anthologies.\nI have raised over $200,000 on Kickstarter from 13 different projects, and have gotten exceedingly good at crafting amazing books that audiences love.\nI have a simple motto when it comes to Kickstarter. I outlay all the money to get the book print-ready, and then I bring it to my audience and try to raise finishing funds for the book.\n\nTwo types of Godsverse Chronicles books\nThere are two different types of books in the Godsverse Chronicles. The first type are individual character books, which feature stories from the individual characters from the Godsverse. The second is team-up books, which feature multiple characters teaming up to take on a massive threat to the universe. \nBelow, I'll talk about each type of book. \nThe individual character books and their heroines\nThe Godsverse is all about strong-willed women who take their fate into their own hands and fight back against their destiny, even if it's against the gods themselves. While that trait binds them, they are each very different as well.\nEach of these books features one of the main characters from the Godverse. \nThis is the series order, and how they will appear on Amazon.\nAnd Hell Followed Behind Her\nAnd Ruin Followed Behind Her\nAnd Death Followed Behind Her\nAnd Doom Followed Behind Her\nAnd Darkness Followed Behind Her - NEW\nWhile you can read the first four in ANY order, you absolutely need to read And Darkness Followed Behind Her AFTER And Conquest Followed Behind Her, as there are spoilers in that book for the rest of the series.\nAnd Death Followed Behind Her\nKatrina was just a normal person with a simple life. Then, the Apocalypse descended upon her, and she spent two years fighting with and living among monsters.\nThey were neither pleasant nor polite neighbors, so she snapped and set out to Hell to kill the Devil.\nThat's when the carnage started.\nAction, adventure, humor, and chaos abound in this mythological fantasy supernatural thriller book box set that's paced for edge of your seat excitement.\nJoin Katrina on three hair-raising adventures that pit her against God, the Devil, Zeus, Hera, and Cronos himself as she traipses across the universe breaking as many things as she fixes, fighting her way through Greek, Roman, and Judeo-Christian mythology, and causing trouble at every stop along the way.\nAnd Doom Followed Behind Her\nThe Universe is a dangerous place\u2026even for the gods\n\n   Rebecca Lobdell survived her planet being attacked by a vicious alien race in And Death Followed Behind Her, but now she has taken on her biggest challenge yet.\n  Rebecca Lobdell has joined the Godschurch, an intergalactic agency that protects gods around the universe. For a time, their job was easy. However, a terrorist organization known as the Godless has found a way to kill gods, and they won\u2019t stop until every seemingly immortal being is vaporized into oblivion.\n\n   Follow Rebecca Lobdell as she journeys from planet to planet to bring down the Godless and return peace to the universe. Continue your journey through the Godsverse with the follow-up to And Death Followed Behind Her, but now from a totally different perspective.\nAnd Hell Followed Behind Her \nLiving is the best revenge\u2026even if it\u2019s living in Hell. And Hell Followed Behind Her combines three fantasy thrillers into one book.\n\n   In Betrayed, Akta is poisoned, sent to Hell, sells her soul to the queen of the underworld, and comes back from the dead to seek revenge on the king that killed her.\n\n   In Fallen, God asks Akta to retrieve a fallen angel in Hell, which sends Akta traveling across the underworld with her new guide, Lucifer, as she seeks to fulfill God\u2019s wish and achieve eternal salvation in Heaven.\n\n   In Hellfire, a conspiracy has arisen to kill the Devil, and Akta is the only one who can protect the newly appointed king of the underworld, Lucifer, and assure he\u2019s not murdered before he\u2019s even settled into his new job.\nAnd Ruin Followed Behind Her\nPixies are real. They are being hunted. Julia Freeman must protect them. And Ruin Followed Behind Her combines three books into one.\n\n   In Mystery Spot, Julia Freeman finds out that she is a pixie and must stop a dangerous cult from using her blood to open a portal to Hell.\n\n   In Into Hell, Julia travels into Hell to rescue a young pixie who was kidnapped by an evil banshee as a gift for the dark lord, Lucifer.\n\n   In Last Stand, Julia tracks a secret society that wants to use pixie blood to summon a demon to do their bidding, and only Julia and her new apprentice can stop them. However, when their investigation goes south, Julia must survive her most difficult challenge yet; the pits of Hell.\n\n  If you love dark fantasy, demons, action, and adventure, then pick up And Ruin Followed Behind Her today.\nAnd Darkness Followed Behind Her\nAfter the first four individual character books came out in 2020, fans asked me to write a book starring Kimberly, Julia Freeman's ward and acolyte in And Ruin Followed Behind Her. \nThis is her book, and like the four before it, there are three stories inside, which take place at different places throughout the timeline of the Godverse Chronicles. \nKimberly hasn\u2019t had an easy life. It started with her being kidnapped by a banshee at the tender age of eight years old. As a teenager, she watched in horror as her mentor was sacrificed at the hands of a bloody cult. As an immortal, she helped save the world from the throes of Ragnar\u00f6k.\nHowever, there is so much more to her incredible story.\nAnd Darkness Followed Behind Her follows fan-favorite Kimberly across three stories encompassing different monumental, never before seen moments in her immortal life.\nThe first story, Death\u2019s Kiss, sees a college-aged Kimberly as she desperately tries to summon Julia from beyond the veil of death with the help of the demon queen Lilith.\nIn the second story, Death\u2019s Return, Kimberly tries to find the love of her life during the first days of Hell\u2019s bloody siege on the Earth in The Godverse Chronicle\u2019s first story set during the Apocalypse since Katrina Hates the Dead.\nThe final story, Death\u2019s Bargain, picks up after the events of And Conquest Followed Behind Them, and deals with the ramifications of Kimberly\u2019s new role in the cosmos.\nTeam-up books\nThese are my Avengers-style team-up books featuring multiple point-of-view characters from through the Godsverse universe. It's a great way to catch up with your favorites in epic adventures with the fate of the universe in the balance. \n***And Conquest Followed Behind Them - NEW\nPOV: Characters: Katrina, Akta, Julia, Kimberly\nThe Lords of Hell collude to ruin Katrina and end her reign as Devil.\nKatrina has been the Devil for over 150 years, and the demons of Hell hate her. Not only is she a woman, and a human, but she\u2019s trying to modernize Hell, bringing technology to Dis, and treating monsters like employees instead of slaves.\nBlasphemy to the natural order.\nA conspiracy congeals to take down Katrina by summoning the Four Horsemen and initiating the cataclysmic destruction that is Ragnar\u00f6k.\nIf the demon dukes succeed, the Universe is doomed.\nOnly Katrina, Julia, Akta, and Kimberly have any chance of stopping the world from descending into chaos.\n***IF you buy only one book, this is the one I recommend. It will introduce you to all the main characters, even though it will spoil some of what happens in the previous books. \nAnd Chaos Followed Behind Them - NEW\nPOV: Characters: Katrina, Akta, Julia, Kimberly, Rebecca\nThe end of the Universe is coming, and it will consume everything in its wake.\nIt\u2019s been over 10,000 years since the Apocalypse, and all is not well in the cosmos.\nThe Godschurch is in shambles after the events of And Doom Followed Behind Her, hemorrhaging money and support among the pantheons. Katrina, Julia, Akta, and Rebecca spend their days fighting for backing among the deities but are making mercilessly little headway with them.\nIn the eyes of the immortals, the Godschurch is a joke. However, when the gods start dying at an incredible rate, the church might be the only hope for the galaxy\u2026whether the divines like it or not.\nJoin Katrina, Akta, Julia, Kimberly, and Rebecca in the most explosive entry into The Godsverse Chronicles yet, as they work to stop the Primordials from unraveling the very fabric of existence\u2026with the fate of the universe hanging in the balance.  \nWhich pledge should I choose?\nI know there are many pledge levels.\nThis is the curse of having so many books. \nI tried to design the pledge tiers in three tracks: digital, physical, and pin, each of which is broken down below, with what is included in each.\nI have found that people are either physical book backers, digital book backers, or pinheads, and either way, I want to make sure you have the right options for you.\nIf you don't see something you like, please message me and let me know. I'm sure I can help you select the right pledge level for you.\n Digital book track: \n***Note: Every pledge over $50 comes with a special thanks. Every pledge over $100 comes with tuckerization (being written into a future book). You must have your name to me within 48 hours of the campaign ending, or I will use your Kickstarter name.***\n$1 - original outline for And Conquest Followed Behind Her\n$5 - one Godsverse ebook\n$10 - two Godsverse ebooks\n*$15 - three Godsverse ebooks* - This will get you all three new novels. \n$20 - four Godsverse ebooks\n$25 - five Godsverse ebooks\n$30 - six Godsverse ebooks\n***$35 - SEVEN Godsverse ebooks*** - This is the complete novel collection of all SEVEN Godsverse stories, and my recommendation for digital buyers.

Do you have any extra goodies only available during the campaign?\nAbsolutely I do. The great part about Kickstarter is that YOU are helping me create the books and make them available. No other humans in the history of the universe will help this book get made, except for my team, and Kickstarter backers.\nBecause of that, I always like to offer something unique and special for backers that nobody else, no matter how many copies they buy, will receive.\nSpecial thanks\nEvery pledge over $50 receives a special thanks inside all four books for helping me creating this universe. Every printing of the book and every person who buys it digitally will see your name inside the book. You must have your name to me within 48 hours of the campaign ends, or I will use your Kickstarter name. \nTuckerization\nEvery pledge over $100 gets themselves written into a future Godsverse book as a minor character, in name only. This is perfect if you or somebody you know is a big fan of the Godsverse. I've only offered this inside two of my books ever, and it's a lot of fun.\nEvery person who ever reads the book will see your name, and you'll be able to tell them that you helped me make this series happen.\n\nWhere is the money going?\nThis is easily my most expensive novel series, as they are the longest and most involved of anything else I write.  As I'm still printing POD, I still don't know exactly what I will be paying for printing and shipping, but I've used last year's numbers as my estimate of what it would cost to break even on these books. \nProduction - $4,900\nPrinting - $3,000\nShipping - $2,000\nKickstarter - $1,100\nPrinting will be more expensive because there are SEVEN books to print this time, instead of four, which brings the total cost to $11,000 to break even on these books. \nThey are still just so, so, so expensive, but I love them so, so much. \n Other books and pins\nSo, there is a chance you've gotten this far and don't know that I am a pretty prolific author who's written a lot of well-received comic books that, um, weren't drawn, but were still written and published, by me.\nDuring the Kickstarter campaign, you can choose from several of our other books. Here's a quick rundown of what we have available.\nIchabod Jones: Monster Hunter\nIchabod Jones: Monster Hunter - Ichabod is my most beloved graphic book, and has gone into eight printings thanks to the help of thousands of fans. It's about a mental patient that escapes from an asylum and becomes a monster hunter during the Apocalypse, but doesn't know if he's killing monsters, humans, or its all in his head the whole time.\nCheck out the first issue for free by clicking here.\nKatrina Hates Dead Shit\nThis is my most popular book and the first comics drawing credit for Marvel artist Juan Frigeri, who has worked on things like Renew your Vows and Immortal Hulk among others.\nKatrina is about a woman who gets sick of living during the Apocalypse so she sets out to kill the Devil, and along the way gets embroiled in a battle between Heaven and Hell.\nHere's a couple of interior pages.\nGet a preview of issue #1 by clicking right here.\nPixie Dust\nPixie Dust was drawn by Nicolas Touris and is meant to be read like an animated movie. It's been likened to Zelda with gore, or a failed D&D campaign.\nPixie Dust is about a pixie monster hunter who sells her soul to the queen of the underworld and comes back from the dead to seek revenge on the king that murdered her. This second book takes place 3,000 years before Katrina Hates the Dead/Katrina Hates Dead Shit. You can find the novelization of this graphic novel in the And Hell Followed Behind Her book.\nHere are a few of my favorite panels from Pixie Dust.\nThe first two pictures are of Akta, and the last is of possibly my FAVORITE character in all the Godsverse, the goddess Velaska.\nGet a free preview of Pixie Dust by clicking right here.\nCthulhu is Hard to Spell\nCthulhu is Hard to Spell is the first volume of our smash hit anthology series. It contains 35 stories about the gods and monsters of Lovecraft. There are funny stories, cute stories, scary stories, psychologically damaging stories, but they all deal with the gods and monsters themselves.\nThe first volume of our anthology series is a 176-page hardcover collection featuring 35 amazing stories from 70 more creators, featuring stories by Lea Hernandez (Teen Titans Go) and Megan Hutchinson (Will o' the Wisp).\nHere's a rundown of the styles.\nCheck out a sample of the stories by clicking here.\nCthulhu is Hard to Spell: The Terrible Twos\nCthulhu is Hard to Spell: The Terrible Twos is the second volume of our smash hit anthology series.\nIt contains thirty-eight all-ages appropriate stories from 73 creators about the gods and monsters of the Lovecraft universe. Yes, there is horror, but there are also silly stories, funny stories, sci-fi stories, whimsical stories, and slice of life stories as well. The focus is on the gods and monsters themselves, with plenty of psychological and cosmic horror thrown into the mix, too.\nThe second volume features stories by Paul Jenkins (Spider-Man) and Tony Donley (Grimm's Fairy Tales), Ray-Anthony Height (Wakandaverse), Christian Gossett in his FIRST comic book art duties since The Red Star years ago, and a fantastic cover by Aaron Alexovich (Invader Zim).\nIn total, over 70+ creators contributed 38 incredible stories to this 160-page hardcover collection, and the results are pretty mindblowing.\nHere is a rundown of the styles.\nCheck out a preview of the book by clicking here.\nMonsters and Other Scary Shit\nMonsters and Scary Shit is an anthology filled with 30 stories from more than 50 creators. It's cute stories, scary stories, funny stories and more all about monsters, and it's the cover that the nightmare elf is from, drawn by Invader Zim artist Aaron Alexovich.\nHere are some images from that book (assuming the .gif loads. If not, just give it a minute).\nHere's a rundown of the styles.\nTo get a preview, click right here.\nI'll also have all of my pins. \nThe blocks and square pin are 2\", the Cthulhu head pin is 1.25\", and the rest are 1\". \nYou can pledge $45 and get any four pins you would like from this set.\nYou can also pledge $95 and get ALL ten of our pins.\nThe Crush it on Kickstarter course is my introductory course about how to run a Kickstarter campaign. It shows new creators (or ones who want to up their game) how to create, launch, fund, and distribute their campaigns.\nAnd it's 50% off during this campaign!\n***READ THE LYNCHPIN BOOK OF THE UNIVERSE, AND DEMONS FOLLOWED BEHIND HER, FOR FREE BY CLICKING HERE.***", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe risks are REALLY low on this one, since I've already set everything up and I'm not doing a big print run for the books, so I really, really think this will go smoothly, but I suppose there's always a risk of nuclear winter, or something else going wrong.

For the young and young at heart...for anyone who loves mellifluous mammals saying silly things, as hijinks and high adventure ensue! \nFans of Paddington, Ratatouille, Babe, and Winnie The Pooh will want to spend time with Fight-Bunny and her beautiful bevy of beleaguered beasts in The Great Flooded Forest!\nLEGEND TELLS OF A BUNNY!\n...but not just any bunny. Oh no. A Fight-Bunny! \nThe Effervescent Adventures Of Fight-Bunny is the super-true story of a bunny what likes a fight, so she grabs a sword and a cape (like you do) and goes trawling for tussles.\nArt by Meyer, Script by Cosby, Letters by Maher\nShe travels, from forest to field to fjord, seeking to assist any with an issue only resolved by outsized confidence, and butting in before she understands what the problem actually is!\nAll was well in The Great Flooded Forest! Squirrels and foxes played gin rummy, birds enjoyed bubble baths, there was a hippo with very judgy opinions on tea preparation...life was swell. But on a specifically particular day, WATER started FLOODING the forest...and the cause? BEAVERS WITH IMPRESSIVE WORK ETHICS! While some of the animals prepared to move on to higher/drier ground, others fretted and flailed and fanned out for a hero to save their home! \nGLUP (a mouse)\nLuckily, at that very moment, they were visited by (spoiler)... Fight-Bunny!\nCAN Fight-Bunny battle and baffle a bevy of belligerent beavers? WILL the secrets of The Great Flooded Forest unfold in time to save all those that live there? WHY is the hippo SO adamant about the boiling temperature of their English Breakfast tea?\nFind out in this all-new, all-ages comic!\n\nWho Are We? \nJENNIFER L. MEYER is an award-winning artist whose work has been featured multiple times in Spectrum: The Best in Contemporary Fantastic Art. Her previous work includes Star Wars Adventures: Chewbacca, If I Could Give You Christmas, Saving Emma The Pig and many more. Born into a fantasy-loving military family, she grew up a big fan of comics, reading, and drawing animals (especially bunnies).\nNATE COSBY is an Eisner and Harvey Award-nominated writer/editor/producer who's worked on Cow Boy, Thor The Mighty Avenger, Red Sonja, Jim Henson's The Storyteller, Buddy Cops, World War Hulk, Spider-Man Loves Mary Jane, James Bond, The Wonderful World Of Oz, Flash Gordon, World War Hulk: Aftersmash: Damage Control, and soooooooooo many other things. He runs indie comics publishing house LINNEY INCORPORATED.\n\nARIANA MAHER is a Brazilian American letterer with a decade of experience. She is a new member of Virtual Calligraphy, a lettering studio that works on titles produced by Marvel Comics. Her recent projects include Outpost Zero (Skybound), Lupina (Legendary), James Bond (Dynamite Entertainment), Catwoman (DC Comics), and Excalibur (Marvel Comics).\n\nWhat Can You Get?\nThe Book: The Effervescent Adventures of Fight-Bunny is 45 pages of story, printed in an 8.5x5.5 inch hardcover, color book. You can also get the book digitally, or with a bookplate by Jennifer and Nate!\n\nThe Pins: We are excited to provide Fight-Bunny as a small enamel pin (measuring approx. 2\") as part of some of our reward levels! You can also get the amazing hippo pin, as an add-on. How do add-ons work? Well, select your reward level, pledge, and then you will see the opportunity to add-on a hippo pin to your pledge!\nThese pins are possibly the MOST aggressively adorable things you can put on your jacket/bag/cork board/etc (y'know, pin places!), and are of course designed by the great Jennifer L. Meyer!\nCommissions: At higher levels, you can get yourself a custom commission from artists Chris Eliopoulos, Roger Langridge, Bob Q, Jacob Edgar, or Marc Laming. \nWhat's up with shipping?\nDue to the unpredictable nature of shipping costs, we will be adding shipping prices onto this project later in Backerkit. You will be sent a survey to your e-mail, closer to when we actually ship the book in 2021. The survey will ask for your shipping address. Our estimates for shipping costs are as follows: \nPin: US - $3 / Canada -  $12 / Elsewhere - $14\nBook Only: US - $3 / Canada - $19 / Elsewhere - $25+\nBunny Pack: US - $9 / Canada - $19 / Elsewhere - $25+\nRetail: US - $15\nWhy Kickstarter?\nWe have had this idea of a lil' fighting bunny for years, and we want to make it exactly the way we see it in our heads. Kickstarter finally makes it possible for us to give Fight-Bunny life and send it directly to the people who will love it most, in the MOST affordable way possible!\nWhere does the money go?\nThe funds raised in Kickstarter will make it possible for us to pay our creative team and produce a limited print run of Fight-Bunny!\nThank You!\nFrom the bottom of our pie-loving hearts, we (and Fight-Bunny!) thank you so much for your support!

If you use a screen reader there is a text only version of this campaign here.\nThe Board Game Survival Kit is a fun gaming accessory that contains a combination of common board game player pieces and dice that allows you to play as your colour even if the game doesn't include it. No more deciding between a bunch of playing colours you don\u2019t want. Instead, take your survival kit with you to every game night and use your own game pieces.\nIt comes in a mint tin that fits neatly in your pocket. The tin will have waterproof vinyl stickers as well to make the product more durable for travel. There are three versions to choose from: Basic, Meeples and Deluxe (see 'Tin Contents' below). There are also 10 colours available to choose from: White, Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Purple, Pink, Black and Any. See 'Examples' later in the campaign for some possible uses for your Board Game Survival Kit.\n\nYou will be able to decide on your colour in the pledge manager after the campaign ends, in the meantime I'd love if you could comment on the project with your preferred colour, not only will it be lovely to see but also it will help me gauge the numbers of each colour that I need.\nThe tin fits neatly in your pocket and has a sliding lid that will stay closed rather than hinged tin lids that can open by accident.\nThe 'I play any' kit is designed for the person who always says \u201cI\u2019ll be any colour.\" It comes in a rainbow tin with a mixture of different coloured pieces inside. The two dice will match each other and the 5 (or 10) meeples will match each other too so that the kit is useable for you.\nThese are just examples of the many combinations you could receive.\nPhotography by Small Fries Games\nBut I want it all!!\nWhy can't I have 10 meeples and the mini dice set?! The answer is of course you can! I've included the mini dice set as an add-on item. If you choose the meeples reward tier you can add the dice set with Kickstarter's new add-on system. Please keep in mind with those 10 meeples taking up space you wouldn't be able to fit your dice in the same tin but they'll come in a little black drawstring dice bag.\n\nDo you have trouble differentiating between colours?\nI would love if this kit is not only fun but beneficial for those who struggle to differentiate colours. I would like to send out stickers to anyone who may need them to adorn their player pieces with so they can tell which are theirs. Hopefully this would mean you could use your kit to help with many games, no need to put stickers on your own copies of games you may want to resell in future, or a friend's game you wouldn't want to mess with. If this would be beneficial to you, I will provide stickers to anyone who feels like they may help (at no extra cost), just get in contact with me to let me know.\nPlease excuse the labels printed at home for the prototypes and the missing black cylinder and purple pawn\nImage for scale of the mini 7 piece dice set (red) against standard size set. Close up of both D20s\n Basic - 5 meeples, 2 D6 dice, 1 cylinder and 1 pawn\n Meeples - 10 meeples, 2 D6 dice and 1 cylinder - made with worker placement games in mind\n Deluxe - mini 7-piece dice set* in black mini dice bag, 5 meeples, 2 D6 dice, 1 cylinder and 1 pawn - made with tabletop role playing games in mind\nAs you can see from the photos provided the components all originate from different sources so the shades of each colour on each piece will vary.\n\n*The mini dice set is only available in 6 colours (red, purple, green, blue, yellow and orange) I really wanted to accommodate pink, black and white but sadly I couldn't find a supplier for these. Because of this anyone who backs this project for the deluxe kit (whichever colour you choose) will be able to choose from these 6 colours in the pledge manager after the campaign.\nAs a Kickstarter exclusive you can get a personalised copy with your name on the tin!\n\nI've put some examples together for you to see, if you'd like to see an example of your name before committing to your reward tier just let me know. (These images are quick examples, keep in mind the finished labels will be trimmed to size and will have rounded corners).\nNames up to 5-6 characters can use black and white text, longer names are best in black or white text only and may need to be repositioned.\nAll Board Game Survival Kits are available in the 10 colour options seen on the main image (White, Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Purple, Pink, Black and Any (Mixed)). With the exception of the mini 7-piece dice set which will be available in 6 colours (as listed in the 'tin contents' section).\nCustom Mini Memory Mischief means you can choose the two dice and two heart action tokens that come with the game (it doesn't include a personalised tin like The Board Game Survival Kit).\nDice bags measure approximately 9cm x 8cm when flattened and fit a standard size 7-piece dice set.\nHandmade dice bags and meeple keyrings in a variety of colours will be available for you to choose from in the pledge manager after the campaign, feel free to contact me ahead of time to check if a colour you want is available, this also gives me a chance to make enough of the colours people want.\n Please keep in mind that add-ons may increase the cost of postage.\nUK - The Board Game Survival Kit is a UK developed gaming accessory and I'm delighted to be able to offer Free Shipping within the UK.\nRest of the world - I will ship worldwide and shipping will be calculated and charged in the pledge manager after the campaign. Here are the estimated shipping fees:\nImportant shipping information, please read:\nKeep in mind that the delivery month on your reward is the date by which I will fulfil the project, it may not arrive in the same month.\nIf you add more games (weight) to your order these costs may be greater. The cost will be worked out by weight in the pledge manager for you, if you'd like to check ahead of time what your final cost will be just message me.\nPlease note that you may be responsible for duties, handling fees and taxes applicable to your region, especially if choosing to buy in bulk.\n*Shipping for bundles/large orders outside of Europe will be sent via 'Economy' mail which can take a long time to reach its destination. If you would like to pay extra for 'Standard' delivery I can arrange that for you, for details check the FAQs.\nThese are just a few examples of when your Board Game Survival Kit might come in handy. With the exception of Tri To Win, I am in no way affiliated with any of these games and they are only used for illustrative purposes. These examples focus on the playing pieces rather than the dice which you could choose to use whenever you need a dice roll with 1-2 D6\u2019s or the 7-piece set when playing Dungeons and Dragons and other tabletop role playing games.\nAtikin Games is an indie tabletop games publisher and very much a one woman show. It's just me, Nikita, hi! I do all the game design, art, writing, etc for my games and gaming accessories myself. I'm very proud of my work and love the board gaming community and being a part of it.\n\nI run The Indie Tabletop Newsletter which is full of news from other indie designers and is released once a month. And I regularly host #BoardGamersLift's over on Twitter on a Monday.\n\nThere are some very important additions to my team for whom Atikin Games wouldn't be the same without:\n\nThere's Captain; he's the Atikin Games mascot and even has his own page on the website. He's a wonderful mascot and a great therapy cat for when times are tough. He's also very good at testing the durability of a game.\n\nMy husband is always my first play tester, and then another close family friend helps as well so that I can iron out any possible problems and strengthen the game before play testing with a larger audience.\nSo far, I\u2019ve created 3 games, and I love them all. If you\u2019d like to know a little more about my games please keep reading.\n\nMini Memory Mischief \u2013 is a cute and nerdy mint tin game for 2 players based on Last-In-First-Out memory processing played with Mikro and Chip, two cute pixel cartoon characters that let you play on their memory stacks. In the game you use operators to push and pop letters on and off of memory stacks in order to get the most letters in alphabetical order before your opponent. It funded on Kickstarter in October 2020 with the help of 231 backers.\nSmall Fries Games Review\nTabletop Games Blog Review\nMovin' Meeples Review\nBoardgamegeek Ratings\n\nTri To Win \u2013 is a triathlon themed card game for 2-6 players and tonnes of fun for friends and family. You build up the skills of your athletes whilst building the race course together before racing on the board game you\u2019ve just built out of cards. It funded on Kickstarter in February 2020 with the help of 132 backers.\nSmall Fries Games Review\nAmazon Reviews\nBoardgamegeek Reviews\n\nMalum Hortus \u2013 is currently in development and already has a fan base all of its own. It\u2019s a much bigger board game with a horror theme and some wonderful artwork. It\u2019s a 1-4 player co-operative game, you play as nymphs trapped in and trying to escape an evil garden that\u2019s beautiful by day and dreadful at night. I hope to be able to kickstart it towards the end of 2021.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs I have previously worked on a small mint tin project made from my own home (Mini Memory Mischief) which fulfilled early, and a manufactured game (Tri To Win) which I fulfilled within 2 days of receiving the games from China, I feel confident in my own ability to fulfil a campaign. There are always some risks and challenges, especially with suppliers meeting deadlines and a pandemic still going on. I will do my best to fulfil on time despite any hiccups that may occur.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nLong-lasting design\nThere are no disposable components.

This means I'm not outsourcing manufacture and not shipping/importing a large quantity of games from China.

Since their creation, these mafia bunnies have been featured in two full-length comic collections (Meet the Family and The Blind Tiger), several booklets (Based on a True Story Vol. 1-2), and have run amuck in countless comic anthology projects (Unlawful Good, Out of the Deep, Forgotten Histories...just to name a few). \nAnd yet, after all of these successful products, there's one project that really shows the true nature of the Dust Bunny Mafia outside of the comic book landscape, which has eluded me thus far: playing cards. With this Kickstarter, I plan to make that dream into a reality. \nIntroducing Dust Bunny Mafia Playing Cards\nThis deck will be a 55 card, standard poker-sized deck of playing cards featuring 52 of my favorite Dust Bunny Mafia characters from the comics to complete the standard deck. \n\nThis will be a limited edition print run for the deck. No more than 500 decks will be produced.\nHere you'll find all 52 cards that complete the standard deck.\nDeck Specifications\nFor the funding goal of $3,000, below are the playing card specifications. As stretch goals are unlocked, there will be chances to upgrade elements of the cards. The more funding that's raised, the better deck quality I will be able to produce.\n Card Stock: (S30) Standard Smooth\n Size of deck: 55 cards\n Print type: Full color print\n Finish: MPC game card finish\n Packaging: Custom Tuck Box (Unsealed) - Glossy\n Box seals: Custom seal\n\nJoker Cards\nAlong with the standard deck there are 3 Joker cards. Two of the Jokers are by guest artists, which will be revealed during the campaign. \n\nThe first guest artist Joker card is Floyd the Crow as drawn by Sean Luke, creator of the Zombie Raygun comic. You can find Sean Luke on Instagram, check out Zombie Raygun on Facebook, or pick up your own copy of Zombie Raygun on Indyplanet\nThe second guest artist joker card is by The Awkward Yeti (Nick Seluk)!\nNick Seluk is the creator of The Awkward Yeti, Heart and Brain, Medical Tales Retold, and Olo.\nYou can find Nick on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, and Patreon.\nThe third, and final Joker card, is a Mobimal (Mobster animal) commission card.\n\n***DOMESTIC U.S. SHIPPING INCLUDED***\nWhat do people say about the Dust Bunny Mafia?\n ***READ BASED ON A TRUE STORY VOL. 1, A DUST BUNNY MAFIA MINI COMIC COLLECTION, FOR FREE BY CLICKING HERE.

With Aveliana I want to bring novelty to indie games with fun and original gameplay! Aveliana is an infiltration-action-adventure game!\nJUMP INTO THE ADVENTURE AND PLAY THE DEMO ON Gamejolt!. \nAveliana is a 2.5D game with unique gameplay: based on the detection pattern of enemies, you find your own route through the world. All the enemies can be avoided in the idea of a commandos-like. The gameplay is ultra-dynamic because it is focused on a single character, Aveliana. \n(This trailer was selected as \"best indie game trailer\" by Best Indie Games!)  \nIf you feel one path is too complicated or you want to explore a new route, it is always possible to find a secret path, in which the game smoothly transition from 2.5D to a 2D platformer. And if you are tremendous, you can choose to stand and fight your enemies!\nThe gameplay is constantly renewed in Aveliana thanks to the many enemies that I have crafted for you. Each of them has a different detection and attack pattern. Tall enemies, like robots, can not be directly targeted because they are too tall. However, Aveliana has other tricks in her bag. All along with the game, you will also unlock new abilities to build your character. \n Don't you love hiding in high-grass?\nPLAY\n\nAveliana is also a game with beautiful environments that you will want to explore to discover all the secrets of the game (and you can contribute to it in some rewards!). Each level has a different environment and atmosphere. Sometimes, after an action-packed sequence, you will have the joy to admire the landscape before continuing the adventure! After a long journey in an environment entirely hand-drawn, you will face fierce and unique bosses!\n2.5D / isometric view environments:\n2D environments:\n Note: you don't like too difficult games and you just want to know Aveliana's story and discover the levels? No worries, there will be a \"story mode\" for you! \nThe game will be initially released on Steam and will support Windows, Linux and Mac. Later it could be ported to consoles.\nElevator pitch\nAveliana is an action-infiltration-adventure game recognizable by its art design as well as for its fun and unique gameplay!\nEmbrace Aveliana\u2019s quest to bring back someone she has lost! The game takes place alternatively in an isometric or a 2D point of view and is fast-paced. Guide her through arduous paths watched by monsters, follow the trace of a mysterious fox, and find the powerful artifacts she is looking for at the core of wonderful temples. Will you stealth your way to victory? Seek a forgotten path on the edge of a cliff? Or stand and fight against your enemies? The choice is yours!\n PRESS KIT\nWhat are my inspirations?\nJust before starting the game development, I was playing a series of games that probably initiated the thought process in my mind. I played Zelda Breath of the wild, Celeste, Cuphead, Disco Elysium, and finally Children of Morta. I am also inspired by other games such as Gris, Commandos, Rayman origins, and of course Zelda Ocarina of time! Other arts also inspire me, such as painting or music, but also poetry, and anime (in particular Miyasaki's work that I find unique and so poetic!).\nWhat makes Aveliana unique?\nThe gameplay, the story, and the art style!\n2.5D to 2D smooth transition! You can find hidden 2D passages but if you fall, you may fall onto enemies:\nPLAY\n\nUnique and diverse stealth gameplay\nPrecise and fast gameplay for experts (speedrunners!), and adjustable for occasional gamers\nA recognizable artistic design\nHand-drawn environments with a lot of variety\nA meaningful story with a lot of story twists\nChoose your set of skills for the adventure\nIn Aveliana, at the start of each level, you can reassign your abilities and adapt the set of skills to the upcoming level and to your playstyle. For instance, here the first ability I have chosen (which is the one by default in the demo) is the Dash ability because I like to move quickly, but I could have chosen the Hard skin instead to take less damages. For each slot, you will have to choose between two options! \nFoes in Aveliana \nAll enemies in Aveliana have their own detection and attack pattern! The game already has three \"common\" enemies that detect you with a cone (like the yellow guys in the little video below)! Each of them will be of a different type (melee, zone, ranged)!\nHere you can see the new ranged enemy I have just implemented (quite challenging to fight for me):\nPLAY\n\n It also already has 7 unique and more challenging enemies, like the ones below, that will force you to modify your approach and think about your movements! Look at the rewards because you could participate in the development of more enemies like this!\n (this one below you can only see when you are on specific spots where you can activate your medallion)\n(that one makes a circle around you and you have to stay in it!)\nPLAY\n\nAnd finally, we have already three unique bosses in the game! One more is programmed!\nAll this variety in terms of detection and attack patterns is excellent for renewing the gaming experience all along with the game! The enemies can combine in fun and original ways to surprise you at all moments!\nWhat about the story?\nWhile looking for three artifacts, Aveliana will wander a poetic yet dangerous world and discover about her and her environment! As an indie game developer and following my personal thoughts about our world, I wish to use the videogame as a medium to share and carry meaningful messages. As a scientist, what passionate me the most is how a bunch of atoms can come to live, think, eat, love, etc. Aveliana is a strong and reckless bunch of pixels; she is guided by a fox and she starts to understand who she is thanks to him! The whole artistic design, being minimalistic and poetic, has been thought for you to enter into Aveliana\u2019s story and to live a great experience!\n[Work in progress] In-game, if you want to get more details about the story, you can use your medallion and scan around to find hidden little NPCs that will give you the precious information:\nPLAY\n\n Who is Thefrenchdev? \nI'm Romain, a French man from La Rochelle (France). I'm 32 and I have started this project at the end of February 2020 and I literally fell in love with game development. Since then, I have been working on Aveliana every day during my free time (from 6 pm to midnight). It has become my passion and the development has gone so well that I have quickly been able to share playable demos with people. This has motivated me, even more, to continue working on it and make it as fun, interesting, and enjoyable as possible.\n I jumped into game development suddenly but I have a background in programming since I am a theoretical physicist and I have painted and drawn all my life. This has helped me a lot during the whole journey since I haven't had to remove any good idea for the game because of technical limitations.\nI am doing this project solo but I receive a lot of support and help from my wife, Fanny. We did a lot of brainstorming for the story and we often discuss artistic and gameplay ideas!\nThey loved the game! \nThe Escapist has selected the game for The Escapist Game Showcase!\n Gamejolt has selected Aveliana to be featured as an Indie Gem! \"YOU are an indie gem! Really excited to follow along on your progress!\" \nThe game was selected in a video by Best Indie Games!\nAll these awesome guys including IndieGameiacs!\n Why I am doing this Kickstarter? \nBy backing the project, you can really make it outstanding and support a solo indie dev who put all his heart into it! If the game release is successful, maybe I can make my dream come true and become a game developer! \nFirst, for the game development, I want to invest in a new computer because the one I am currently using has neither a great GPU nor CPU. This would help me to be more efficient in game making and game testing (which is an important upcoming phase). For now, it suffers a bit when I need to test the game having other software opened (Unity3D, Photoshop, etc.)!\nOne big reason to kickstart this project is that I would like to raise funds to attend game events and promote the game. I think many beautiful indie games have been forgotten because no one knew they ever existed. Going to such an event costs about 1-2 K$ for the registration fee, the transportation (when we are able to travel again), and a hotel room.\nThen I would like to be able to afford to pay the people who are gratefully contributing to the game. I am specifically thinking about game music. I think the music is so great that the composer deserves more than what she is asking for.\nI bought a few days ago instruments and tools to make and register music (a workstation, a MIDI controller, a sound card, a DAW software, and an amp)! But who will make this music and why? Well, my wife plays the piano very well and I play guitar so we want to make additional music for the game that will be played procedurally. This means, the current music will be used as intro/outro tracks and for special events in the game and the new music will vary depending on what you do! For instance, if you encounter a lot of enemies, the rhythm and instruments in the track will change. I hope this will create a unique atmosphere and I think I have not seen this kind of thing in a game! I am really excited about it and I will use part of the Kickstarter funds for the things I have bought.\n I really want to make a Switch version for the game, and reaching the main goal and then the stretch goal for it would convince me totally to do it! Plus, I have been accepted (in just 3 days!) as a Switch developer (this means they really loved my project)! I will surely dedicate some funds to the port to this console.\nThe Kickstarter goal of 12K will greatly help me with this project! It will also unlock the Kraken (a unique mini-boss that I will design, draw, and implement in the game!).\nThe two stretch goals are important bonuses! The first one is a totally new world and environment for the game that I will draw, design, and implement! This is a mock-up of an environment that I want to create: \nPLAY\n\n The second stretch goal will unlock the voice-over for the English version! I would love so much to have voices for the game story. \nA new and unique reward!\nI have added a new reward called \"The music lover\" which is unique and is a big support for me! \nFor the game, I want to continue working with Ally, who is making awesome tracks, and I want, with my wife, to create new music that will be used during the levels and will be generated procedurally. This means the music will change accordingly to what is happening with smooth transitions. For this, I borrowed some money to pay for a midi keyboard, a sound card and to pay for the 16-tracks version of Bitwig (it is a DAW, a software to create music). All the funds from this reward will be used used to reimburse the instruments and to pay for the upgraded version of Bitwig (I have found some really awesome sounds that can only be used in the \"studio edition\" and tested (but can't be saved) in the \"demo version\"). This is why this reward is unique and matters so much for me: it will contribute to an extremely important piece of the game! If you love music and game music this one is for you! You will have access to all the soundtracks that we will make thanks to your contribution and we can discuss about game music during a discussion.\n(you can make your design)\nBONUS: The music lover is the only one who will be able to add a bonus to his pledge to order a unique Vinyl of Aveliana's soundtracks! The design isn't definitive and because it will be edited only once, you'll be able to choose your image of the game for the cover and the sticker.\nPhysical rewards! (organic/environment-friendly materials)\nI have prepared rewards with a lot of attention and I hope you will love them!\nFirst of all, all ranks have access to a digital version of the game when it will be released!  \n A reward for everyone: If we reach the first Kickstarter goal, I will implement the Kraken into the game! Alongside much other stuff for which you can contribute!\nDiscover the rewards!\nThe design of the tote bag and Aveliana's portrait illustration has been done in collaboration with LesPetitsMo who is an awesome french artist I've discovered during the game development! \nThe other designs are the artworks I have done for the game. The scene with Aveliana and the fox is my absolute favorite, I have spent 10 hours on it! I also love the T-shirt design with Aveliana surrounded by many little details that correspond to the lore of the game (e.g. the fox, the medaillon). If you choose a reward with an illustration please contact me in order to tell me which one you prefer! (non-definitive designs)\nT-shirt (choose your design)\n\nTote bag (design LesPetitsMo)\nPrints (size approx. 21x31 cm)\nContribute to the game creation! \nI have prepared contributive rewards so you can participate in the game making!\nWrite a piece of text that will be added (on my approval) in the game! \nIt can be a side-story, a joke, a quote, a poem, anything you'd like! People will be able to read it in the game and you will be credited in the game! Characters in the game will talk about your legend, or have a laugh when reading your funny joke. I think this is really a unique way of adding your name to the game!\nDesign a new mini-boss or enemy for the game!\nWe will discuss and collaborate to make a new and awesome new monster for the game. Your contribution can be either sketch, drawings, animations, or just ideas of an awesome monster that would make the quest of Aveliana even more arduous!\n\nWhy doing eco-friendly rewards and at what cost? \nI have decided to make the rewards as respectful as possible of the environment because this is something that matters to me! I also wanted to have good fabric for the T-shirt, tote bag, and high-quality paper and printing for the illustrations. For this, I have decided not to increase the reward prices thus it will slightly reduce the margin I will get from physical rewards. For you, it's all beneficial and I hope you will appreciate it!\n Share the news and join us on social media! \nSince I have started the project, about 7 months ago, I have grown a community of more than 8K followers on Instagram, Twitter, and Discord. This has been an exceptional journey with a lot of awesome feedback. I would love it if you'd like to participate in it, follow me, discuss with me, and make the game even greater than it is right now! And you can find news about the game, about the Kickstarter, about Steam release, etc.\nFor the launch of the Kickstarter, I am going to start a fanart challenge! There is nothing to earn and it is all for fun (to thank all the artists that are following me)! The last events I organized received the participation of over a hundred people (#thefrenchdevDTIYS on Instagram)!  Check for more info on my social media!\nRemember you can wishlist the game on Steam!\nTHANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT! MERCI!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are always risks when doing such a big project alone. However, I have managed to progress a lot already on the game development and there are already many milestones that have been reached (getting a Steam page, making a demo, etc.).\n\nAt which stage am I in the project and what is the plan?\nEven if this is my first game development project, I think I know from the start where I am going and what is the scope of the game. This has helped me to always be on time with my schedule, and even be in advance on many aspects (for instance the IA of the game is already done, the game mechanics and the physics is coded, I have already about 18 levels that are completed and ready for polishing, etc.).\nI have started the game development on the 23rd of February and after about 1 month, I have started to send versions to people on my social media so they could try it and give me feedback. I got a lot of positive feedback and bugs to solve. After 2 months of game development, I have proposed a \"pre-alpha mockup\" on Gamejolt, which has been played more than 250 times! I received a ton of really good feedback and this demo was stable. Then I focused on doing a real demo for the game, the one you can find now on Gamejolt. This version is a glimpse at what will be the game in terms of story, art design, gameplay...\n\nNow for the next 6 months, I want to focus on drawing all the levels of the game (about 25 for about 6-7 hours of estimated gameplay). On the fly, I will of course add new enemies, implement the story, and add features (such as unlocking new abilities for Aveliana). After this, I will enter the final phase of the game development and during the last 6 months, I will focus on polishing everything. Playtest the game a lot and finish the drawings, animations, cutscenes...\n\nI think I can say now that the game will be finished because the project is sufficiently advanced and I see where I am going with it. All the stages have been completed ahead of time until now. \nThe current version of the game is playable and stable, it is just too short and it doesn't carry yet the story I want to tell!

See Our Stretch Goals!\nKickstarter Loves Our Project and We Love Our Supporters\nABOUT THE AUTHORS\nOur authors are a father, Curtis, and daugther, Ruby (2), who are creating a series of children\u2019s books inspired by the whimsical conversations that followed when Ruby asked \u201cwould fox eat orange.\u201d The stories are designed to remind everyone to appreciate the little whimsical moments in their day and to stop and smell (or eat) the roses that life has to offer.\nCurtis and Ruby\nREPRESENTATION MATTERS\nDid you know: Black, Latino, and Native Authors combined wrote only 7% of the new children\u2019s books published in 2017, according to The Diversity Gap in Children\u2019s Books, 2018, Lee & Low Books.\nRepresentation means more than simply including or promoting images of people of color. It also means promoting thoughts, stories, and adventures created from the fertile and unique imaginations of people of color.\n Fox Eats is an opportunity for readers to follow the unique imaginations of an African-American father and daugther. \n\nABOUT THE INSPIRATION\nThe year 2020 was a tough time for family trips, social gatherings, family outings and was an overall lull for most joys of life. Curtis noticed that, despite the world going on pause, Ruby\u2019s curiosity in the fine details of the world was incessant and her thirst for learning and growing did not take a break simply because the amusement parks and grand events had shuttered their doors. \n One day Ruby asked \u2018would fox eat orange?\u2019 Daddy almost said no because he wasn\u2019t sure what a fox might or might not eat. On another occasion at the park, Ruby asked if fox might eat a soccer ball, or green grass, or a big butterfly. At the pumpkin patch, she declared confidently that fox would eat a pumpkin because fox likes the seeds and the bumps on the pumpkin.\n Curtis and Ruby took this wondrous curiosity and love of learning to create the Fox Eats series. The little fox in our stories reminds readers of the youthful curiousity within all of us. We too can see the world with renewed perspective each day and follow our hunger to learn more!  \nABOUT BOOK 1: FOX EATS A RAINBOW\nThe first book, Fox Eats A Rainbow, is currently available on Amazon and follows our curious little fox as it discovers a rainbow for the first time and decides to take a bite. Readers follow the little fox on this poetic adventure learning the colors of the rainbow based in part on Ruby and Curtis\u2019 whimsical conversations about what fox would eat.  \nFox Eats A Rainbow (Cover Design)\nThe little fox is on the move\nSees a Rainbow!\nFox Eats Orange\nLook what happens when Fox Eats Orange!\nWHAT YOUR CONTRIBUTION MEANS\nWe hope to continue the Fox Eats series. Your contribution will fund the illustrations and printing costs for Books 2 and 3.\nEach dollar you pledge means we are one step closer to making the Fox Eats dream come true. Too often, especially among people of color, our children\u2019s voices and thoughts and imaginations are suppressed and forced into quiet corners. The stories in Fox Eats are inspired by the wonder, closeness, and love that can only be felt in the quiet conversations between parent and child. We hope to inspire families around the world to let the parent-child stories, imaginations, and joy run freely and openly.\n HOW WILL WE USE YOUR PLEDGE?\nYour funding would cover expenses for Book 2 and 3 in the following way:\nIllustrations - 40%\nPrinting - 35%\nContent Creation And Marketing - 20%\nKickstarter Fees - 5%\nSTRETCH GOALS \nUpdated After Reaching Our Funding Goal!\nWe are so happy to update our stretch goals in light of reaching our funding goal!\nIf we are fortunate to reach the below overfunding milestones, we would be able to grow the Fox Eats stories in powerfully unique ways.\n[Giving Back!] $3,000 - We will donate 25 books to charities and educational institutions in the Austin, TX area!\n[More Giving Back] $4,000 - We will offer giveaways and donate a combination of 100 books to families in need and educational institutions Nationwide!\n[Growing Fox Eats] $5,000 - Release hardcover editions of Book 1 and Book 2\n[Reaching More Readers] $10,000 - Create an audiobook version of our stories to support persons of unique circumstances\n[Growing Fox Eats] $15,000 - Animate Fox Eats A Rainbow and make content available on Youtube", "risks": "Risks and challenges\n1.

They teach them where to find food, what to eat and how to build a sleeping nest. Well I didn't, until I was lucky enough to take a field trip in Sumatra, Indonesia. The reason I had the pleasure to go on this trip was because I work with wildlife and nature conservation at WWF International. \nLet\u2019s start from the beginning. Once upon a time, there was an island called Sumatra. It was completely covered in rainforest, inhabited by all kinds of weird and wonderful wildlife \u2013 including orangutans, dubbed by natives \u2018men of the forest\u2019 for their uncanny similarity to humans. The rainforest was so thick that the natives said orangutans were able to cross the whole island, swinging from tree to tree, never touching the ground.\nAnd then palm oil arrived.\nI wrote this story shortly after my visit because I was shocked at the rate of deforestation in Sumatra and saddened that the Orangutans have declined by around 50% in the last 60 years.\nBing is about to leave his cosy nest for the first time and take a swing into the wild Indonesian forest. He encourages bravery, determination and imagination.\nYoung readers of all ages will find that it\u2019s not all doom and gloom out there \u2013 and that your imagination can be the key to solving the problems facing our world today.\nThe book is approximately 95% complete pending any minor alterations. The book will only be printed on-demand to avoid paper from continuing to incentivise deforestation. Please think twice before acquiring a physical copy.\nThe writing sets you deep in the forest and pulls you in through a clever and daring story told in rhyme. Your child will quickly find themselves lost in Aneta Neuman\u2019s extraordinary detail of the jungle. It's a page-turning experience that is sure to awaken a wildling.\nPerfect for girls and boys ages 4-10.\nSize: 8in x 10in, 22 pages.\nAdditional activity pages and resources to talk to your child about deforestation will be available to help you learn and enhance topics children are learning in school these days.\nInvesting in the creation of this book will help me fund final illustrations, initial printing, marketing and creating future books in the Wee Wild World series. Every plush and keyring package purchased will aid wildlife conservation projects.\nAbout Wee Wild World: Nature conservation stories of friendship, bravery and hope. Mildly touching on complex topics and encouraging young naturalists and wildlings on a journey into a world where they feel inspired to become problem solvers, change-makers and innovators.\nLastly, don't forget to follow Bing and his friends\u2019 adventures on Instagram\nI'm truly grateful for your generosity and support\nThank you!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThank you again for your interest and support of Bing and his swing!\n\nReduced staffing around the world due to COVID-19 has often caused delays in production and shipping for many products.

These books will guide children, and adults alike, through worldly adventures, learning about different cultures, and making friends. Future books will include more coffee explorations, surfing adventures, and more. \nIn Slothee Wants Coffee, Slothee travels from Costa Rica to Brazil, Colombia, Indonesia, Ethiopia, and Hawaii in search of the perfect cup of coffee. On the way, he meets new friends and learns about coffee and culture. Will Slothee find the best cup of coffee? Read this book to join him on an educational, yet fun adventure!\nFeatured on Yahoo News, MSN, The Patch, and Oncenoticias\n\nTHE INSPIRATION \nAfter traveling domestically and internationally, the inspiration behind 'Slothee Wants Coffee' comes from the love of exploration (and coffee)! As a single mom, my goal is to set my son up for success and allow him to experience new surroundings. Slothee and Slothee's mom represent that relationship and desire to encourage learning through discovery.\nOn a trip to Costa Rica, we fell in love with sloths, seeing them in the rainforests and watching their slow, yet smooth movements. It is our spirit-animal! After taking a coffee (and chocolate) tour, we learned that there is much more than just brewing a cup of coffee. From bean to your cup, it is a process. We wanted to bring that process to life and add fun facts in the book that kids can understand and relate to.\nThroughout this book, we hope to excite children and parents to explore cultures outside of the norm. Not only will you meet Slothee's friends, but you will learn about coffee and traditions. Travel virtually to different countries with Slothee!\n\nSNEAK PEEK\n*The sample pages below are not in order and are being shared to give you a glimpse into the overall style.\n\nBEHIND THE SCENES\nPublishing a book is a process. In fact, 'Slothee Wants Coffee' became an idea one year exactly from when it will be printed and shipped. From writing to editing, illustrations to formatting, printing to shipping, and research in-between every step, it is not an easy process for a first-time author. However, it is a dream. With every emotion came a sigh of relief, knowing that it is a process and the end result will outweigh the many sleepless nights of working on this passion.\n\nTHE AUTHORS\nNikki Pezzopane\nNikki is originally from Metro Detroit but moved to Arizona in high school. She attended Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, receiving a Bachelor's in Criminal Justice and Criminology. Nikki also earned a Master's in Forensic Psychology from Argosy University. However, she realized her heart wasn't with her degree path and took a different route in life by starting a Digital Marketing/Social Media Management company in 2014. Nikki always had a love for writing, even at a young age, so she was inspired by Cameron's idea, and together they wrote Slothee Wants Coffee. She also has a passion for travel, having traveled to 38 states and 16 countries. \n\nCameron Fica\nCameron has a passion for traveling and went on an airplane for the first time at 3-months old. He is 8-years old, has lived in 3 states, and traveled to 14 countries and 22 states. Cameron loves sloths and came up with the idea of Slothee Wants Coffee during a trip to Costa Rica. He also loves playing on the beach, science experiments, and playing Roblox.\n\nKeep in touch with the authors, and find more of their work here:\nEmail: slotheewantscoffee@gmail.com\nFacebook: @slotheewantscoffee\nInstagram: @slotheewantscoffee\n\nTHE ILLUSTRATOR\nYury from Yury Illustration is an illustrator based in Europe.

I think so. I hope so. Our 12-page comic includes deliberate twists and a Twilight Zone feel, so the fewer spoilers, the better.\nOnly time and your support can confirm my hypothesis.\nTHE REWARDS \nThere are only three reward tiers in this short #make100 campaign: one for readers, one for curious \"process lovers,\" and one for collectors.\nABOUT THE LUMP SUM SAGA UNIVERSE\nThe Lump Sum Saga started as the story of Lump Man\u00ae. I was struggling to flesh out my hero's origin story and getting nowhere fast. \nAnd then Mars Curiosity Rover happened.\nImagine having the success or failure of your entire life's work coming down to one breathless moment in time. The brief seconds before Curiosity reached the surface of Mars were the scientist equivalent of being in the middle of a gold medal high dive at the Olympics. I will always remember the JPL team's shouts of joy and relief that filled the room when they finally received confirmation that they had \"stuck the landing.\" To this day, it still makes me well up remembering the pure emotion of that moment. I needed that for my story.\nWhat began as a fairly standard superhero story ultimately became a story of fearless space exploration and first contact. The story has haunted me for years now. \nIronically, you will not meet Lump Man in this issue. Or even the next. But you will meet characters who personify the same deep commitment to the exploration of another planet that I saw at the Jet Propulsion Lab the day Curiosity landed.  \n THE TEAM BEHIND THE LUMP SUM SAGA \nHow do you ensure that your first comic maintains a certain level of professional quality? My approach was to work with industry professionals who have WAY more experience and \"cred\" than I do. I am proud to have collaborated with so many talented co-creators. Here is our team:\nTHERE IS A PRINTED COMIC COMING BUT...\nThe floppy edition of issue #1 of The Lump Sum Saga, Prologue: Only the Fate of Our World, will be released later this year. However, this digital campaign will let you become one of the first to discover the TLSS universe, without major spoilers, months before others have the print edition in their hands.\nThank you so much for your support of this campaign.

This is the story about brotherly love run afoul, and the people they enlist to do their dirty work.\nMeet the beautiful DINA DELUX, a scientist in the Fizz division at POPSO COLA. She's on the verge of creating a formula that will make soda 50% fizzier, keeping it carbonated longer than any other brand on the market. A breakthrough like this would put all the competition out of business in a heartbeat.\nWhen Popso's main rival FIZZ ONE COLA hear the rumors about the discovery, they activate their best man, JON PYLE, an oversexed mercenary, to take care of the situation. His orders are to convince Dina to switch sides, and if that fails, to eliminate her. However, after they meet the attraction is undeniable and a third option kicks in, one which triggers repercussions from BOTH sides.\nEach book you buy will come with an official CERTIFICATE OF AUTHENTICITY pictured below.  \nSTRETCH GOALS:\nCOVERS:\nHere are just a few of the amazing covers you'll see with these issues from DAVE JOHNSON, ADAM HUGHES and BILL SIENKIEWICZ!\n\nPOP KILL #4 Cover by Dave Johnson\nBILL SIENKIEWICZ Variant Cover\nADAM HUGHES Variant Cover\nSuper Secret Sexy covers by AMANDA CONNER\nPREVIEW PAGES:\nTake a look at some amazing interior artwork from Juan SantaCruz and Brian Rieber from the story!\nREWARDS:\nBelow you will be able to see a visual of all of the great tiers we have available with this campaign for backing.  **Please note, some tiers are limited so please, read each tier description to the right carefully!**\n\n POST CAMPAIGN ADD ONS:\nWe are anticipating having some great Add On options for those backers.

I have a  Masters in Creative Writing for Film & TV and have been working in comics for over ten years. Among this work, I created Cabra Cini: Voodoo  Junkie Hitwoman, a character who had a strip annually in the Halloween issue of H!M Comics' IF-X anthology, and has now come into the Geek-Girl ongoing series. I have self-published two The Almighties one-shots (a comedy super-team co-created with Mike Gagnon); released a 4-issue Geek-Girl Mini-Series through publisher Markosia monthly from Nov 2016, and ran a successful Kickstarter for its TPB - which has now been followed with Geek-Girl's ongoing series.\n\"My favorite comic and biggest influence is Grant Morrison's bizarre run on Doom Patrol,  which has helped inspire a number of weird and wonderful creations that, now we're ongoing, I am going to be bringing to the pages of Geek-Girl. Weirdness such as The Hall of Diamonds, the Rat Fink and Groovejet: The  Living Party are all in GG's future, as  well as the aforementioned Cabra Cini.\"\n\nColombian C Granda is Geek-Girl's artist.

Wild adventures I could get lost in as I followed the heroes along on their journey. Middle Earth, Hyboria, The Young Kingdoms, The Dying Earth. To me, it's not escapism to want to dwell in worlds like that for a little while. The wonderful thing about fiction, especially genre fiction is that it gives you a taste of the impossible - a window into another world. And that feeling, that exhilarating feeling of cracking open a book and getting lost in it, even for a moment, is something that I've always wanted to create for someone else. And I believe that Wailing Blade is a book that will.\nIt's often said that you should make the comics that you want to see in the world. In that respect, Wailing Blade is everything we've ever wanted to see in a comic. It's got action, it's got adventure. Compelling characters, and a lush, vibrant world for them to inhabit.

Come to find out this little \u201crock\u201d is in actuality an alien homing beacon for some previous inhabitants, that just so happen to be the relatives of our Earth dinosaurs. Aboard their ship, The Megalodon, Tor and his team of his misfits known as the Dino-Thrashers arrive from the planet Reptilia and greet the humans that have drawn them to this location. The Dino-Thrashers have been patiently waiting for years for that button to be pressed, but for reasons that are unbeknownst to all others. Joined by his team composed of five other members: Trips, a Triceratops and second in command, Tigrella, a female sabre-tooth tiger whose mouth is even faster than her running ability. Dirus, a Dire-wolf who has seen some battle and has the scars to prove it, but gets through it all with comedy since he\u2019s not the brightest bulb in the lamp. Glide, the comic relief of the team and a Pterodactyl and sniper of the team. And finally Snapper, a giant snapping turtle who is the technology genius and medic that keeps them all from going extinct.\nNoah\u2019s Inks on the Dino Thrashers\nKnowing that another group of not so kind dinosaurs have made their way to Earth, Tor and his team take it upon themselves to make sure they bring them off world. The Terrorsaurs led by the evil and villainous Julius Rex, were once part of the same team of the Dino-Thrashers back on Reptilia, until there was a falling out between the two faction leaders. Joined up with the most ruthless and power hungry billionaire on the planet, Samuel Rhodes, the Terrorsaurs are looking for more than just money on earth. Standing by Rex\u2019s miserable side are his team of numb-skulls: Croc-shot, an overgrown crocodile, who is Rex\u2019s number two and he is treated like a number two most of the time. Brachs is a Brachiosaurus who loves to see things blow up, too bad his brain is the size of a pea and his hand - eye coordination is not even close to 20-20. Jarbeak is a female Pterodactyl that is the recon for the team and always puts her team first, even if she doesn\u2019t believe she has to. Dade is a prehistoric boar known as a Daeodon and to say his brain is the size of a pea would be to give him credit, he may be as strong as a house of bricks, but that\u2019s about all he has in his head, but is loyal to Rex to a fault. Tusk is a woolly mammoth that will beat your behind to a pulp and then as the medic of the team, fix you right up to beat your butt again.\nThrilling Dinosaur Action!\nWith lots of nostalgia for the 80\u2019s and 90\u2019s comics like anything Marvel, DC, TMNT, this is the comic that you are going to want to pick up. Filled with action, comedy, fun and nothing short of spectacular battle scenes!

All art shown during campaign is not final and subject to change. Final product may differ slightly from what is shown.\nThe man known only as Berzerker is half-mortal and half-God, cursed and compelled to violence...even at the sacrifice of his sanity. But after wandering the world for centuries, Berzerker may have finally found a refuge \u2013 working for the U.S. government to fight the battles too violent and too dangerous for anyone else. In exchange, Berzerker will be granted the one thing he desires \u2013 the truth about his endless blood-soaked existence\u2026and how to end it.\nCover art by Rafael Gramp\u00e1. All art shown during campaign is not final and subject to change. Final product may differ slightly from what is shown.\nIf you love intense, savage characters with mysterious pasts like Wolverine and John Wick, Berzerker is sure to be your next favorite warrior! \nPlease note: BRZRKR is an action-packed, high octane comic book series with depictions of graphic violence, blood, and gore.\nTimeline\nBRZRKR will be released in 12 epic comic book chapters and collected in 3 beautiful graphic novel volumes, each containing 4 comic book chapters (issues). Each graphic novel is a 7\u201dx10\u201d, 128 page full color book. Through this Kickstarter, we are offering the opportunity to pre-order all 3 graphic novels (384 pages total!) and receive them directly to your home as they are released in September 2021 (Volume 1), April 2022 (Volume 2), and September 2022 (Volume 3).\nSoftcover set shown. All art shown during campaign is not final and subject to change. Final product may differ slightly from what is shown.\nKickstarter allows fans to pre-order all 3 books with a single purchase and allows us to fulfill them as they are produced and released to the public. When you pre-order on Kickstarter, you can rest assured you will receive the complete story of BRZRKR direct to your door. \n At BOOM! Studios, we believe comic books and graphic novels are the greatest form of storytelling in the world! We\u2019re passionate about helping new fans and potential readers discover their first comic book or graphic novel.\nWhen we partnered with Keanu Reeves on his first comic book, we knew we had an amazing opportunity to reach new audiences. We\u2019re excited to join forces with Kickstarter to introduce people who have never read a comic book or bought a graphic novel to the endless world of storytelling possibilities of comics.\nCover art by Mark Brooks. All art shown during campaign is not final and subject to change. Final product may differ slightly from what is shown.\nAnd for the superfans, we\u2019re also offering the opportunity to pre-order premium and limited edition versions of the graphic novel collections, including a number of versions exclusive to Kickstarter!\nGunmetal edition shown. All art shown during campaign is not final and subject to change. Final product may differ slightly from what is shown.\nFor those of you that love having a super premium, limited edition version to fully celebrate your fandom, Kickstarter gives us the opportunity to offer beautiful deluxe editions that traditionally might only be available as exclusives at comic conventions. \n Most importantly, we can\u2019t wait to share our excitement for BRZRKR, the storytelling art form of comic books, and our love of the comics community through updates in Kickstarter. We hope that by pre-ordering BRZRKR and participating in this campaign, you\u2019ll (a) have a lot of fun and (b) fall in love with the limitless world of comic books and graphic novels.  \n\n\n We\u2019ve prepared eight stretch goals to make the shared experience of pre-ordering BRZRKR more exciting and fun, but also as a way of saying \u201cthank you\u201d to the fans. Each time we unlock a stretch goal by meeting a certain pre-order goal, new features will be added to various tiers or release a shared reward for the fans who have pre-ordered through Kickstarter.\nCover art by Rafael Gramp\u00e1. All art shown during campaign is not final and subject to change. Final product may differ slightly from what is shown.\nThe basic graphic novel set will remain the same throughout the campaign, so if you want to capture any of the stretch goals make sure to check out the other pre-order options.\nThe stretch goals will be hidden until the campaign goal is reached, and we'll start revealing them as the campaign progresses. You can help us unlock additional goals by sharing a link from our Kickstarter page to your website, blog, or social media page. Sharing this pre-order campaign with others will ensure that more people have an opportunity to pre-order and everyone will benefit with new rewards. We hope to unlock all of the goals by the end of the campaign so we can make all of our wild ideas happen!  \n\n Anyone who pre-orders through the Kickstarter campaign will have an opportunity to add-on additional items through CrowdOx after the end of the campaign.\nFor example: if you pre-order the limited edition softcover set, but you also want a copy of the limited edition hardcover set, you\u2019ll be able to add that to your pre-order after the campaign ends.\nAnother example: if you preorder the limited edition hardcover set, but want to pre-order an additional copy as a gift for a friend, you\u2019ll be able to add that on to your pre-order after the campaign ends. \n After the campaign ends, your shipping will be calculated based on your pre-order and shipping address. Shipping fees are not included in your pre-order. Rather, all shipping will be charged after the campaign ends, just before each graphic novel ships.This will allow us to charge the lowest possible shipping fees based on where and when the graphic novel ships.\nEach graphic novel will ship separately as it is released to ensure you receive it as early as possible. Because of this we cannot use a one-size-fits-all approach to shipping and pre-orders will be sent out in waves (more on that below), and shipping will be charged to you based on how many packages you receive and the total weight in each package.\nInterior art by Ron Garney & Bill Crabtree. All art shown during campaign is not final and subject to change. Final product may differ slightly from what is shown.\n We\u2019ve included some estimated shipping costs below for many parts of the world, so that you have a sense of what the shipping costs may be when they are charged. These are only estimates and shipping costs may go up or down before the actual shipping occurs.\nPlease note that Total Shipping costs reflect the total you will pay for shipping and handling for your pre-order. For international orders, please note that your country might have additional customs fees. We do not collect those. Please check your local regulations for that information.\nWe will do our best to minimize shipping costs!\n\nWave 1\nWhen BRZRKR Volume 1 graphic novel is finished, we will verify all backers\u2019 addresses \u2013 including addresses outside of the United States \u2013 then provide this information to our fulfillment partner who will ship your books packaged in a box directly to you. Any metal boxes and prints will be shipped at this time. We expect Wave 1 to ship in September 2021.\nWave 2\nWhen BRZRKR Volume 2 graphic novel is finished, we will re-verify all backers\u2019 addresses \u2013 including addresses outside of the United States \u2013 then provide this information to our fulfillment partner who will ship your books packaged in a box directly to you. We expect Wave 2 to ship in April 2022.\nWave 3\nWhen BRZRKR Volume 3 graphic novel is finished, we will once again re-verify all backers\u2019 addresses \u2013 including addresses outside of the United States \u2013 then provide this information to our fulfillment partner who will ship your books packaged in a box directly to you. We expect Wave 3 to ship in September 2022.\nAbout BOOM! Studios\nWe are BOOM! Studios.\nIt\u2019s a big, bold name. That boldness is no accident, it\u2019s embedded in the DNA of who we are.\nWe love comic books. We believe comics are capable of telling any kind of story. We are storytellers. We believe that the medium of comic books is the greatest way to tell our stories.\nWe were founded by Ross Richie in 2005 with the singular focus of creating world-class comic book and graphic novel storytelling for all audiences. Through the development of four distinct imprints\u2014BOOM! Studios, BOOM! Box, KaBOOM!, and Archaia\u2014BOOM! has produced award-winning original work, including Lumberjanes, Once & Future, Something is Killing The Children, Giant Days, and Mouse Guard, while also breaking new ground with established licenses such as Buffy The Vampire Slayer, Firefly, WWE, Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, Dune, and The Jim Henson Company properties.\nWe get up every day excited to create new fans, readers, and customers for comic book stories.\nWe all need stories. Stories that help us reconnect with our humanity, that capture our imaginations, that help us make sense of the world around us, stories that allow us to escape, and stories that inspire us.\nWe believe that the stories we tell matter and we want as many people to read them as possible. Whether you are one of the millions of people who have never read a comic book or are looking for that first comic to share with someone in your life, we want to help you Discover Yours.\n   ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nBOOM! Studios has been publishing comic books and graphic novels for over 15 years, so we\u2019re very experienced in the production and timely release of books and limited editions. As a matter of fact, in 2019, 98% of everything we published was released on time! BRZRKR the series is in active production already with scripts, line art, colored art, covers, and lettering complete. \n\nWe\u2019re confident that the creative work, printing, and design on these graphic novels will be of the highest quality. The highest quality in storytelling requires careful craftsmanship, from writing the stories to hand illustrating them, bringing them to vivid life with color, and making sure they\u2019re lettered properly for a great reading experience. Our printing partner and our fulfillment partner are top notch and both organizations we\u2019ve worked with for years. Our delivery dates may seem far off in the future, but they reflect the realities of producing the content and delivering it to everyone on time. \n\nThat being said, as we\u2019ve seen from world events this year, it has become increasingly difficult to predict larger disruptions to our supply chain. If we have to delay or hit pause on our production timeline in order to keep people safe, we will do so, in an effort to stay safe and keep others safe.

A craftsman of the culinary arts. Celebrities fill your tables and your bar is never with an empty seat. You\u2019re living the good life, rolling in the dough, when the Dust Bunny Mafia comes knocking at your door. They might look harmless, but it\u2019s hard to resist their investment. You\u2019re partners now, forced to fill their bellies and give them a cut until you\u2019re broke. But the Bunnies aren\u2019t finished. They drop a stogie and burn your baby to the ground. Good thing they made you get insurance. Except the check isn\u2019t going to you.\" - Frank Martin\nThe Dust Bunny Mafia is my series of noir stories featuring anthropomorphic animals.  I'm doing this Kickstarter to pay for the printing of a new set of tales based on real life mafia events.  Here are some of them:\nIn 1944, Joseph Barbara bought a 58-acre parcel of land in the rural town of Apalachin, New York, and built an estate on 625 McFall Road for a total of $250,000. Barbara soon involved himself in local business circles and philanthropy. When Barbara applied for a New York handgun permit, the police chief of Endicott, New York, served as a reference. \nIn November of 1957, an estimated 100 Mafiosi from the United States,  Italy, and Cuba are thought to have attended the Apalachin Summit.  Local and state law enforcement became suspicious when numerous  expensive cars bearing license plates from around the country arrived in  what was described as \u201cthe sleepy hamlet of Apalachin\u201d. After setting  up roadblocks, the police raided the meeting, causing many of the  participants to flee into the woods and area surrounding Joseph Barbara\u2019s estate.\nUp to 50 men escaped, but over 60 were apprehended, including  Commission members Genovese, Carlo Gambino, Joseph Profaci and Joseph  Bonanno. Virtually all of them claimed they had heard Joseph Barbara was  feeling ill and that they had visited him to wish him well.\nIntroducing Based on a True Story Vol. 2\nBased on a True Story Vol. 2 is a 32 page  mini comic collection (8.5\" X 5.5\") containing 29 comics, printed in  glorious full color, each based on a real life mobster story.\nFor years I have been fascinated with mobsters, but more memorable to me than Hollywood interpretations of the mafia lifestyle are the real life stories of the Italian American mafia. \n ***DOMESTIC US SHIPPING INCLUDED***\n\nTruth is Stranger Than Fiction\nFrank \"The Prime Minister\" Costello\nIn June of 1944, the Prime Minister of the New York Underworld, Frank  Costello took a short cab ride. When he exited the cab, he left behind  two envelopes containing $27,200.00 in hundreds and fifties. Edward  Waters, the honest cabbie, found the envelope and turned it into the NY  police. After the story hit the papers, Costello made a claim alleging  this was his money and it was from a debt he collected from a friend. A  court case followed. In the end, Costello only retrieved $120 of the  original amount.\nMilestone Bonus Rewards\n\n\nWhat do people say about the Dust Bunny Mafia?\nWho will love Dust Bunny Mafia?\nFans of mafia-related pop culture like The Godfather, Goodfellas, and The Sopranos.\nLovers of Saturday morning cartoons and the Sunday funny papers.\nPeople who like cartoons such as Looney Tunes and Animaniacs.\nCollectors of high quality independent comic books.\nCampaign Exclusives\nKickstarter-exclusive black-heather Apalachin Cola tee\nMobimal (mobster animal) cameo in the booklet\nLimited edition poker chip\nYour mobimal (mobster animal) on the limited edition poker chip\n\n***READ BASED ON A TRUE STORY VOL. 1, A DUST BUNNY MAFIA MINI COMIC COLLECTION, FOR FREE BY CLICKING HERE. This is a great introduction into the Dust Bunny Mafia universe.***\n***DOMESTIC US SHIPPING INCLUDED, and all books come signed by creator Bret Juliano.***\n\nApalachin Cola Kickstarter Exclusive Tee\n In 1946, Joseph Barbara was convicted of illegally purchasing 300,000 pounds of sugar (intended for the manufacture of bootleg alcohol). Soon after this, Barbara entered the soft drink distribution business, buying a Canada Dry bottling plant. Barbara eventually gained control of the beer and soft drink market in Binghamton, New York.\nIn memory of the historic Apalachin Summit of 1957, I am releasing this Kickstarter-exclusive heather black t-shirt only available in this color variant during this campaign. Once this campaign ends, no additional Apalachin Cola shirts will be sold in this color.\nWhere's the Money Going?\nBret \"The Fedora\" Juliano - Creator\nBret Juliano is a cartoonist and creator of the all ages Dust Bunny Mafia comic, which has over 700 comics in its archive and Mobimals. In late 2016, Bret published Meet the Family, a Dust Bunny Mafia comic collection. In 2019, he successfully funded a Kickstarter for Based on a True Story, a Dust Bunny Mafia mini comic collection. Earlier this year, Bret returned to Kickstarter to fund his second Dust Bunny Mafia collection, The Blind Tiger. His dust bunny mobsters have also been included in several anthologies including Unlawful Good, Forgotten Histories and Out of the Deep as part of the Let\u2019s Make Comics: Chicago Collective. He is an avid  consumer of mafia trivia, both fact and fiction, and a passionate  collector of fedoras.\nFor as far back as I can remember I was always drawing. When I was a  kid, my dream job was to be an animator for Disney, but as I grew up, my  focus shifted into the world of comics...newspaper styled comics  especially.\nGarfield, Calvin and Hobbes, Peanuts, Zits, Get Fuzzy...I could keep  going, but I won't. I would read the Sunday funny paper back to back for  years.\nThese were the things that brought joy to me and my comics, the Dust  Bunny Mafia in particular, is my opportunity to tell my stories and give  back in comics form.\nWhat about the rewards?\n\n\n\n  ***DOMESTIC U.S. SHIPPING INCLUDED***", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis mini collection is 100% complete.

THE BUSINESS OF INDEPENDENT COMIC BOOK PUBLISHING is edited by Aftershock editor-in chief Mike Marts, and features a foreword from writer and Heavy Metal executive editor Joseph P Illidge. It\u2019s a book by pros, for pros and aspiring creators alike. If you\u2019re serious about a career in comics, this book is an essential read. After all: who wouldn\u2019t want to create the next Superman (and retain ownership of the intellectual property)?\nThe book will guide you through the following:\nTurning your creative ideas into published comics\n  Developing intellectual property that you own and control\n  Creating a business plan tailored for your specific publishing goals\n  Finding and hiring a professional team to create your book and support your business\n  Understanding the distribution process\n  Creating comics\u2014that you can be proud of\u2014on time and under budget\n  Using your comics to generate multiple streams of revenue\n  Building a long-term relationship with your readers\n  As acclaimed writer and editor Joseph P Illidge writes in the introduction to THE BUSINESS OF INDEPENDENT COMIC BOOK PUBLISHING:\n\u201cWe are living in the time of a global paradigm shift, from a business culture that wanted to marginalize, trivialize, and ignore the stories and lives of people from diverse communities, lifestyles, life conditions, and gender identifications, to a global corporate complex that invites new stories, diverse narratives, and creators of different cultures.\nThe business relationships of the future will be determined by an understanding of mutual value between the creator and the publisher, making it more important than ever that both sides are armed with the knowledge to protect their intellectual properties.\nTHE BUSINESS OF INDEPENDENT COMIC BOOK PUBLISHING is the roadmap to a secure creative future, a journey that begins with personal and tough questions.Questions requiring the aspiring entrepreneur to be self-aware and honest\u2026.\nThe comic book industry, and business of intellectual properties based on characters and worlds, can be both exciting and perilous. A journey of great importance and substantial reward is best undertaken with the aid of a guide, and the dawning clarity of a clear path.\nYou have found your guide, and the means through which to illuminate your path.\u201d\nComic Pros & Cons' Derek Becker, Gamal, and Dirk Vanover of Vanover Legal, LLC\nTestimonials for Gamal Hennessey\n\u201cHard-working, patient, keen eye to detail, and always on your side. That\u2019s just a few words that described my experience with Gamal and his services. I felt very positive with the work he did and when the need comes about, I would go to him in a heartbeat.\u201d\u2014 Tim Smith, acclaimed artist for Black, Marvel, DC and Archie Comics\n\u201cGamal has provided me with excellent advice on potential publishing contracts on several occasions, and he steered me away from some deals that just weren\u2019t right for my own goals. As a result, I was able to place my creator-owned properties in better situations. I highly recommend Gamal for any comics creator facing the legalese of a publisher contract.\u201d\u2014 Rob Anderson, Writer of Creature Cops, Rex the Zombie Killer and My Little Pony\n\u201cDeadline oriented expert. Innovative, strong and detail oriented professional. He is not only a responsible and hard working General Counsel but also an inspiring professional. I have had the pleasure of working with Gamal since we both left CPM and I have seen him turn his passion into his profession. It's amazing to work with such a person.\u201d\u2014Sara Erickson, Creative Director Design & Development, Hasbro\n\u201cGamal was the first attorney who bothered to explain my contracts to me. He wasn\u2019t just interested in tweaking language, he wanted to increase my understanding of contracts going forward.\u201d\u2014 Andy Schmidt, President of Comics Experience\n\u201cGamal is very knowledgeable about IP and Entertainment law and very professional, but that\u2019s just the minimum. He went above and beyond the call and he took the time to make sure I felt listened to and not only that I understood things, but that I felt understood as well. I have already recommended several people to talk to Mr. Hennessy and I hope to work with him for years to come!\u201d\u2014Ian Powers, President of Dragon's Gate Entertainment, Ltd.\n\u201cI went to Gamal to help me a create work for hire contract and to give me a legal analysis to protect my work. He was incredibly helpful and explained things thoroughly in my consultation. He was also reasonably priced in comparison to many others that I\u2019d inquired after which was a huge help for a small business owner.\u201d\u2014Jack Wallace, President of Disposable Fiction Inc.\n\u201cI hired Gamal to help me put together a boilerplate contract for use as a freelance writer, so I would have clear terms to hold clients to. Gamal directed the conversation, asked me the right questions about what was important to me, and helped me put together a contract that has since served me well (and that I haven't once had to enforce). He was quick, responsive, and far more affordable than just about any other lawyer you're likely to find. I would absolutely recommend his services.\u201d\u2014 Brandon Carbaugh, Author of Black Knight and The Wish\n\"Highly recommended.\"\u2014  Chris Lewis, Author of Karma Police\nWhy We\u2019re Bringing This Project to Kickstarter\nThe plan was to release THE BUSINESS OF INDEPENDENT COMIC BOOK PUBLISHING at New York ComicCon.

He's the first person born with superpowers.  The city's current hero, The Ascender, was patrolling the skies in a metal suit (like Iron Man).  After Johnny's brother got hurt by a psychopath, and the Ascender chose not to intervene, or even help, Johnny decided that he could do a better job, and became KINETIC.\nWell, after two years, eight issues, and thousands of books sold online and at conventions, he's beat the bad guy, mastered his powers, and got the girl.\nNOW WHAT?!\nKinetic: Identities #1 picks up where the story left off.  When a villain from his past is up to his old tricks, it's up to Johnny to save the day!\nBut is Kinetic a match for the villains when this time, they're ready for him?!\nIf you are a card-carrying Kinetic VIP, welcome back!  But if this is your first time hearing about this series, don't worry, I've got you covered.  You don't have to have know anything to read and enjoy this issue, and I've also got plenty of catch-up tiers to get you up to speed.\nThree Main Covers to Choose from!\nI get emails, messages, and even mail to my PO Box all the time asking me when there will be more Kinetic. \nI'm happy to know the answer: RIGHT NOW.\nThere are even more awesome rewards further down the page, but here's a sneak peak at a couple of our reward tiers for backers:\nAt some of  our higher tiers, we also have rare and Kickstarter exclusive rewards, such as Physical Scripts, and these Ultra-Limited Black and White Variants:\nUltra-Limited - ONLY 30 available!\nThis is the first time Kinetic is being offered internationally, but also, ALL ORDERS SHIPPED IN THE USA HAVE FREE SHIPPING!\nI've also got a few other fun surprises up my sleeve as the campaign moves forward...\nThough I'm the writer and creator, Kinetic wouldn't be able to happen without the help of my entire creative team!  They should get all the accolades for how great this book looks!  Here's a little about me, and the rest of the creative team:\nThis book wouldn't be able to happen without the help of my wonderful creative team, and I am proud to call them collaborators and friends!\nSince my very first time behind a booth at my first comic convention, Kinetic has built up a dedicated fanbase...\nAnd a few reviewers, and industry professionals have had some nice things to say, too!\nThere's been a little hiatus since the last Kinetic book released.  We've had to deal with losing an artist and finding a replacement.  Thankfully, we found a wonderful talent in indie comic veteran Luis Rivera.  I met him at a convention, and hit it off immediately.  With Luis onboard, we could get started again.  I am proud to say that, except for Rafael, the creative team remains completely unchanged!\nI just had to tell more of Kinetic's story.  Like so many of you, I've also fallen in love with the world of Velo City, and I knew Johnny's tale wasn't over yet.\nWe're coming back to Kickstarter because my first campaign was so successful, and I want to keep sharing Kinetic with this wonderful community.  Since joining Kickstarter as a backer, I've helped over 50 creators by backing their projects and make their dreams come true.  Kickstarter really is the place you want to find the newest and freshest comics!\nSince last year, we've been running the gauntlet with 2020.  So why now?  Well, with so much going on in the world, the best way I feel that I can help is to continue offering up awesome comics to you.  A sense of normalcy is important in turbulent times, even if it's just a little getaway time away from the madness.\nThe funds raised here will be used to fund the print run of Kinetic, Identities #1, and shipping those books to you.\nIf we're lucky enough to overfund, we'll put that towards making more great comics.\n I would never ask you to back something that I wasn't 100% sure we could completely finish in a timely manner.  The artwork is almost totally done for this book, and I think Luis and Omi did a great job:\nNow, you may notice a few characters are unfinished.  Astute eye, my diligent reader! For the first time ever, we are offering to have you (or a loved one!) DRAWN INTO KINETIC!  You can either be a citizen saved by Kinetic (and help him try to catch the bad guys) OR become a nefarious GOON.\nFind out more about that, and a ton of other fun reward tiers, below...\n\n\nHere's the plan:\nThis is the first campaign I have run where our custom reward tiers (being drawn into the story) actually mean the art is almost entirely done.  I'm factoring in extra time it will take Luis, Omi, and Lucas to have high end backers drawn in the story.  I doubt it will take as long, BUT I'd rather estimate a long time and get you the book ahead of schedule than the other way around.\nHere's what our timeline looks like:\nAgain, I think this timeline is the worst case scenario.  I'd rather estimate a longer time period, and deliver early, than the other way around.\nI want to get these books into your hands as fast as possible. \nWe've gotten our fair share of comics that arrived mangled by the mail carrier.\nYou pay premium prices on Kickstarter, and you deserve better. That's why we've started using Gemini Comic Mailers:\nThese babies are sturdy. They require a little more money, a little more time (and a lot more tape!) but it's worth it to make sure your comics arrive in pristine condition.\nAnd if somehow your comic still gets roughed up?\nI'll replace it free of charge.\n\nThank you for checking out this Kickstarter!  Kinetic would not be possible without the support of the wonderful fans, and I appreciate you giving me the chance to make my dreams of becoming a comic book writer a reality!\nNow, I'm going to ask you to look over our awesome reward tiers, find the one you like best, and let's get Kinetic: Identitites #1 in YOUR hands!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOne of the best parts about working on Kinetic, Volume 1 was it let me get a lot of the inconsistencies and mistakes out of my system. This book is nearly complete: all that's needed now to finish the art is to add in any likenesses from the higher end reward tiers, and then send it to the printer. My last Kickstarter fulfilled before it's estimated time, and I will do my best to fulfill this campaign early, as well.\n\nWith the uncertainties in the world, mainly shipping delays due to COVID, we have added a healthy buffer in the timeframe to account for any delays. We've also estimated very, VERY conservatively for how long it will take to finish artwork and print the books.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "Digital - Kinetic: Identities #1", "descp": "A digital copy of Kinetic: Identities #1.\nINCLUDES:\nDigital Deluxe Copy - Kinetic: Identities #1", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Feb 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["30 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 15 or more", "title": "Physical - Luis Rivera Cover", "descp": "In addition to the digital version, you also get the physical book - Kinetic: Identities #1, featuring the Luis Rivera cover.

It features a huge collection of amazing arcade titles in one book for the very first time, ranging from the '80s to the '90s. This second book from me (Darren Doyle) & Greyfox Books will pay a huge tribute to this incredible and fascinating past time we all loved during our childhood and even now into adulthood. These classic Coin-op arcade games have made a great come back in recent years, becoming very popular once more through emulation or even Mini Arcade cabinets. \nLike our first book \u201cAtari: a Visual History\u201d which successfully funded in May of 2019. It was backed by 665 people, which enabled me to produce the ultimate unofficial Atari book for everyone. Once again I need your help to make this second book a roaring success.\nCoin-Op: The Arcade Guide Front Book Cover\nCoin-OP: The Arcade Guide Back cover\nCoin-Op@ The Arcade Guide page sample\nCoin-Op@ The Arcade Guide Index page sample\nThe Coin-Op: The Arcade Guide is a first for a book specialising in a visual aspect of classic arcade games never represented in this manner before. The full premise of this book is to produce a visually rich experience based on multiple genres of classic arcade titles. \nThe book will be split across 9 chapters to cover all areas of the Coin-Op gaming scene in a fully-fledged hardback book. Chapters in the book will cover:\n Side-scrolling Beat'em up games \nArcade Driving games\n Arcade Shoot'em\u2019 ups \nArcade Action games\nMiscellaneous arcade games\nObscure arcade games\nArcade Horror inspired games\n1 vs. 1 Fighting games\nAn arcade Hall of Fame\nWith over 100 classic arcade games covered, each one has its own bespoke layout to showcase each game in all its visual beauty. We have some amazing arcade trivia for you in here too and some exclusive interviews and much more ensuring a premium publication with a word count of 60,000 \u2013 70,000 words.  I have also included some really neat bespoke ideas that you will discover as read the book, but that will have to remain a surprise for now. The main aim is to produce the book in an A4 annual sized orientation. I believe it would be criminal to have it any smaller than this and it will feature the following specifications:\nAnnual Size format\nBook size:  8.5\u201d x 11.5\nBook Cover: Gloss finish\nPaper stock: 140-150gsm page thickness\nPage count:  300 pages + endpapers (imagery)\nPrint quality: Satin Silk Finish (highest finish)\nBinding: thread-sewn bind\n Weight: 1.68kg  \nCoin-OP: The Arcade Guide book preview\nThis publication will only be available in a hardback form, making the Coin-Op: The Arcade Guide a must-have coffee table book. The print quality will consist of a 150GSM gloss cover stitch bind with a satin page finish on each page within the book to ensure beautiful quality throughout this publication. \n-=STRETCH GOALS UNLOCKED=-\nAll Stretch goal reached! \n 1 x 4-page gatefold will be added to the Coin-Op: The Arcade Guide. \n 1 x 4-page gatefold will be added to the Coin-Op: The Arcade Guide. \nEverybody will now receive a large Holographic Arcade Sticker with their book.\nTen Extra pages with more arcade titles will now be added to the book for everyone.\nNow that we have funded the book thanks to all our amazing backers, We want to add even more to the book for you. So Become a backer and find out what these stretch goals are. \nContent within the Coin-Op: The Arcade Guide\nLet\u2019s have a look at what the book is about? \nWhen I started working on the Coin-Op: The Arcade Guide it was initially planned to be part of another publication back in 2012.  I felt this would be such a missed opportunity to simply have one arcade title covered in each issue of this magazine. It was then that I decided to make it a fully-fledged publication in its own right hence the Coin-Op: The Arcade Guide was born, The book covers some fantastic and unique arcade games from your childhood.\nCoin-Op: The Arcade Guide Side-scrolling beat'em up introduction pages\nSo let me introduce the chapter covering side scrolling fighting games. I decided to display each game in a way never seen before in a publication. For example, I cover classics like \u201cDouble Dragon\u201d & \u201cCadillac & Dinosaurs\u201d. Each one includes many elements and not just simple screenshots or write-ups and that's the same for each title covered. They will include pre-mastered \u201cArcade Flyer\u201d artwork including specifications on the year of release and the hardware used. All in-game imagery has been all captured in the game's original resolution so as not to spoil the final presentation or look.  Every game featured in the book gets a description of what was so good about them and maybe even tempt you to play them if you haven't before. Also, each game gets some facts and trivia you may have never read about previously. \nDouble Dragon (\u00a9 Technos / Taito 1987) - Alien vs. Predator (\u00a9 Capcom / Twenty Century Fox 1994)\nCoin-Op: The Arcade Guide 64th Street (\u00a9Jaleco 1991)\nThe Coin-Op: The Arcade Guide is a book aimed at both newcomers and arcade enthusiasts. Each chapter of the book covers 10 select arcade titles as well as other surprises I can't tell you about for now. One great piece of trivia about the project is each title has its very own layout and design, this is something I am extremely proud of, ensuring every game in the Coin-Op: The Arcade Guide is completely different and something you simply do not see other publishers and authors doing, but then again they aren\u2019t creating the ultimate arcade guide book are they?\nFollowing on from the side scrolling chapter is the shoot'em up/SHMUPS chapter where we look at games like Namco's\u2122 \u201d,\u201d detailing the original cabinet artwork to showcase just how stunning this cab was. Another game we look at is the epic Sega\u2122 isometric arcade hit \u201cZaxxon\u201d from 1982. We use a ton of imagery from each shooting game so you will need to spend quite some time examining each game in detail. So if you are a vintage shoot-em-up fan you\u2019re going to love this by your side.    \nCoin-Op: The Arcade Guide - Shootem' Up title introduction\nI wanted to cover a varied collection of shoot'em up titles in the book due to the sheer amount of games in this genre. So it was tough to choose which games to include and leave out, but remember the focus here is heavy on the visual impact of these amazing games and how much they have come on as you read about them.\nZaxxon (\u00a91982 Sega)\nAll the classics are here for you to reminisce about, to stare in amazement at those beautiful graphics and gameplay screenshots. This chapter is a very special addition to the Coin-Op: The Arcade Guide book.    \nParodius (\u00a9 Konami 1990) - Galaga (\u00a9 Namco 1981)\nOne of the most popular genres in arcade gaming has to be the \u201cArcade Driving game\u201d. I've spent many hours deciding which driving games to cover in the book from the arcades of the past trying to balance what people remembered fondly or never got a chance to experience back in the day and I think I\u2019ve managed to select some of the greatest driving games we all loved to feature in the book.  \nOutRun (\u00a9Sega 1986)\nSega\u2019s\u2122 1987 hit \u201cOutrun\u201d has to be the best one of the best arcade machines and do you remember that thumping music? Or the adrenaline injecting turbo-boosting thrill ride of the brilliant Taito\u2122 hit \u201cChase H.Q.\u201d both are covered in all their visual glory for you to reminisce over and will hopefully urge you to have another play once more.\nChase H.Q. (\u00a9Taito 1988)\nNext up is the \u201cArcade Action\u201d chapter which covers some great classics like Bally Midway\u2019s\u2122 \u201cJoust\u201d testing the patience\u2019s of a saint or Atari Games\u2122 & LucasFilm\u2122\u2019s second collaboration with the brilliant \u201dIndiana Jones and the Temple of Doom\u201d  I feel have covered a diverse collection of action arcade games in this section of the book for you to read about. \nCoin-Op: The Arcade Guide - Arcade Action Introduction sample page\nA few examples of what you can expect in this chapter below.\nIndiana Jones & the Temple of Doom (\u00a9Atari Games 1985) - Joust (\u00a91982 Williams) - Black Tiger (\u00a9Capcom 1987) - Strider(\u00a9Capcom 1989)\nWhen faced with the sheer amount of content we could have added to this book, I took the decision to add two extra special chapters that would cover \u201cMiscellaneous Arcade Games\u201d like platformer style arcade games, examples like Taito\u2019s\u2122 arcade perfection that was \u201cBubble Bobble\u201d or Bally Midway\u2019s\u2122 ingenious beer tender arcade classic \u201dTapper\u201d to name but a few are all in here for you.  \nTapper (\u00a91983 Bally Midway) - Dig Dug (\u00a91982 Namco) - Bubble Bobble (\u00a91986 Taito)\nOnce you have seen the attention to detail that has gone into the book you will understand why it is the ultimate Coin-Op Arcade guide. Classics like Atari Games\u2122 Gauntlet, Cinematronics\u2122's \"Dragon Lair\" and Capcom\u2122 's \"Ghost\u2019n\u2019Goblins\" and so on are all covered. I have done my utmost to present a wide range of content throughout the book for you and promise that it will not disappoint, in fact, I believe it will only fuel your love for arcade games as you progress through it.\nSo rather than simply having you read about one game after another, I have broken up the game content with some unique material with a section of the book. I\u2019ve called \u201cDid you know?\u201d covering some great and rare trivia facts that I researched across 4 full pages of arcade goodness.  \nCoin-Op: The Arcade Guide \"Did You know?\" Sample pages\nI wanted to cover some arcade history within the book and \"DataEast\" was the company I chose mainly because of their prolific output of games over the years. This is followed up by another great showpiece within the book called the \u201cThe Arcade Hall of Fame\u201d, covering an additional 30 arcade flyers from the very best arcade vendors of the 1980s & 1990s completely remastered to their original state. Also included is a huge array of classic marquee artwork included from a total of 60 remastered pieces, all in ultra-high-resolution artwork. You will see every line and dithered colour halftone as it was meant to be seen in the Coin-Op: The Arcade Guide book\nDataeast Feature - Arcade Hall of Fame sample pages\nCoin-Op: The Arcade Guide Marquee Art sample pages\nCoin-Op: The Arcade Guide Arcade Flyer and Marquee Art sample pages\nAnd finally a collection of unique interviews with the prolific Arcade Club based in the UK, Free Play Bar Arcade based in Rhode Island in the United States, and Level Up Arcade & Restaurant based in Limerick, Ireland to add something fresh and interesting about running an arcade.\nNow, to the dark side of the book\u2026yes..the Horror chapter of the Coin-Op: The Arcade Guide covering a satanic collection of pixelated gore or blood and was quite surprised how little the genre has been covered anywhere in a publication, so this chapter is here to straighten this out. From the crypts of Exidy\u2122 \u2019s sadistic minds brings \u201cChiller\u201d, a Zombie mash-bash side scrolling beat'em up from DataEast\u2122 \u201cNight Slashers\u201d through to the horrific mansion of Sega\u2122 \u2019s horror light Gun smash hit \u201cHouse of the Dead\u201d, all the best of the best horror titles are featured in the book.  \nHaunted Castle (\u00a91988 Konami\u2122) - CarnEvil (\u00a91998 Midway Games\u2122) - Splatter House (\u00a91988 Namco\u2122)\nAnd finally one of the most popular genres in the arcades had to be the 1 vs. 1 arcade fighters. With many reputations on the line pitting life long friends against each other, facing off in a tag or 1 vs. 1 fighting tournament. I was heavily exposed to this culture back in the day it was only fitting to include this genre in the Coin-Op: The Arcade Guide book.  \nCoin-Op: The Arcade Guide 1 VS. 1 Fighting title Introduction page\nLike the SHMUP section of the book, this chapter could get its own publication on its own right, I wanted to include so many fighting games and the task of choosing them was not easy either.  However, I believe I have chosen some of the best games in the genre, like Capcom\u2122 's \"Street Fighter 2\", Namco\u2122 's amazing \"Tekken\" or SNK\u2122 's fantastic \"King of Fighters'94\" are all in here for you. \nSamurai Shodown (\u00a91993 SNK) - Fatal Fury 2 (\u00a91992 SNK) - Mortal Kombat (\u00a91992 Midway Games) - Street Fighter 2: The World Warrior (\u00a91991 Capcom)\nThere is so much content covered in the Coin-Op: The Arcade Guide, it's been an amazing personal journey for me and after many years in production, I can finally bring it to you all on Kickstarter. I hope you will help make this happen for everyone by pledging so we can all experience these amazing games in all there glory in one magical tome. Allow yourself once more to cherish and hold these amazing arcade games close to your heart as much as I have. \nLet's shout together why a book like this needed to be published.\nGames listed in the book.\n64th street\nAlien vs Predator\nCadillacs & Dinosaurs\nDouble Dragon\nTeenage mutant ninja turtles\nKung Fu Faster\nShadow Warriors\nViolent Storm\nTiger Road\nWWF Wrestlefest\nChase h.q.\nEnduro Racer\nOutrun\nPole Position\nRally - x\nRoad Blasters\nSpy Hunter\nStun Runner\nSuper Hang-on\nSuper Sprint\nGalaga\nGunbird\nParodius da\nRaiden\nR-type 2\nShock Troopers\nStar Blade\nThunder Blade\nXevious\nZaxxon\nAliens\nJoust\nBlack tiger\nGhost 'n' goblins\nIndiana Jones and the temple of doom\nStrider\nRastan\nRolling Thunder\nShinobi\nSunset Riders\nArkanoid\nCommando\nBubble bobble\nDig Dug\nDragons Lair\nGauntlet\nOperation Wolf\nReturn of the Jedi\nTapper\nTrack 'n' Field\nTron\nChicken Shift\nPyscho Nics Oscar\nDomino Man\nMonster Maulers\nSnap Jack\nLaser Ghost\nTimber\nBlazer\nThe Astyanax\nBogey Manor\nChiller\nNight Slashers\nEvil Night\nHaunted Castle\nSpace Gun\nCarnEvil\nSplatterhouse\nHouse of the dead\nBeast Busters\nCrypt killer\nKarate champ\nStreet Fighter\nMortal Kombat\nFatal Fury 2\nVirtua Fighter 2\nStreet Fighter 2 - the world warrior\nThe King of Fighters '94\nTekken\nSamurai Showdown\nDarkstalkers: The Night Warriors\n Plus another 74 games are covered which will remain a TOP SECRET.\n\nSo let's see what we have to offer with the book, including exclusive and backer-only pledges when you pledge on the book. I have thought long and hard about presenting and producing incentive perks, created especially for this Kickstarter campaign. Thinking why people should consider pledging to help this product get funded? Here\u2019s why I think you'll agree that they are unique, exciting & original. There are 5 exclusive perks for you to choose from in the hope it will offer you a great incentive for your investment to the Kickstarter campaign. \nSomething you don't see much of these days in people's gaming rooms is classic old school posters, sure you have your neon signs, etc, but where are the bespoke designs? I wanted to go all out and commission an original design so I contacted veteran video game artist and industry legend Simon Phipps. Simon has worked on many classic video game projects including, Rick Dangerous, Switchblade, and Harry Potter video game series to name a few. \nSimon Phipps Video Game Artist\nSimon has been in the video game industry for over 30 years and I have always admired his work and am a huge fan, the design was a collaboration of minds, together with both Simon and myself created my vision for a poster in spectacular style any Arcade fan would love hanging on their wall in celebration of Coin-Op video games and I believe we have achieved just that! \n Coin-Op: The Arcade Guide Bespoke Poster\nMy idea was to feature bespoke art of characters and arcade machines that feature form the Coin-Op: The Arcade Guide and unify them in one arcade scene piece. Each one of these scenes was inked and pencil-drawn and finished off with a presentation of Neon elements to capture the vibe and atmosphere from those days of course.  \nCoin-Op: THe Arcade Guide Bespoke Poster close up\nCoin-Op: The Arcade Guide bespoke poster sample preview\nCoin-Op: The Arcade Guide Bespoke poster full-size preview\n The Poster specifications are of the highest print quality for such a bespoke masterpiece.\nSize: A2 Photograph print\nQuality: 170gsm Silk \n Shipped in an A2 cylindrical tubing \n Coin-Op: The Arcade Guide bespoke Wallet \nIntroducing a world-first pledge concept for those that want a custom bespoke identity item on their person we are proud to introduce the Coin-Op: The Arcade Guide bespoke Wallet you don't see in Kickstarter campaigns too often.

That's right, the crew at PAPERFILMS has put together another exicting issue of the successfully launched comic series POP KILL.  Issue #2 of this action packed, beautifully drawn, top quality production will be available for everyone to join in on the campaign.  Featuring some of the top talent in the field to present to you our 40 page second issue of an ADULTS ONLY comic mini-series called POP KILL ! \nWritten by JIMMY [ Painkiller Jane, Harley Quinn, Jonah Hex ] PALMIOTTI and DAVE [ 100 Bullets, Red Son ] JOHNSON and illustrated by the amazing JUAN [ Painkiller Jane, Twilight Experiment ] SANTACRUZ with colors by BRIAN [ X-Men, Bloodshot ] REBER, lettering by SEAN [ Aliens, Aliens vs Predator ] KONOT and the brilliant design by John J Hill , the man responsible for so many great projects there are too many to list, but for the PAPERFILMS projects, he designed the PAINKILLER JANE Hardcover and the KILLING TIME IN AMERICA hardcover.\nTHE STORY:\nImagine a world where the two dominant and competing Cola companies, each worth billions, are owned by former Siamese twins who are now separated and have grown to hate each other so much they hire assassins, saboteurs, and espionage personnel to meddle with each other on a daily basis.  This is the story about brotherly love run afoul, and the people they enlist to do their dirty work.\nIn the first issue, we met the beautiful DINA DELUX, a scientist in the Fizz division at POPSO COLA. She's on the verge of creating a formula that will make soda 50% fizzier, keeping it carbonated longer than any other brand on the market. A breakthrough like this would put all the competition out of business in a heartbeat.\nWhen Popso's main rival FIZZ ONE COLA hear the rumors about the discovery, they activate their best man, JON PYLE, an oversexed mercenary, to take care of the situation. His orders are to convince Dina to switch sides, and if that fails, to eliminate her. However, after they meet the attraction is undeniable and a third option kicks in, one which triggers repercussions from BOTH sides.\nThe story continues in issue 2 as Dina learns more about Jon and deals with her life going up in flames as they both hide out to let things cool down, which unfortunate for them, they do not.  With this issue, the excitement and espionage gets amped up a bit as both sides start to come apart at the seams trying to control their rivalry as Jon is fooling himself that he has everything under control.\nTHE PREVIEW:\nBelow is a short sample of what you can expect with this exciting issue of POP KILL!\nPOP KILL #2 Preview\nPOP KILL #2 DAVE JOHNSON Standard Cover\nPOP KILL #2 DAVE JOHNSON LTD VARIANT COVER\nSTRETCH GOALS:\n**UPDATED**  The great thing about hitting the campaign total so amazingly early is that we can plan some great STRETCH GOALS.

For 20 years I lived in the big city and worked at tech companies. My heat and water came from city utilities.  My food came from the supermarket.\nOne of our sheep, Elsif, and her daughter.\nSeven years ago I moved to a farm in the countryside.  I still work for tech companies (remotely), but now I heat my house with firewood from my forest. I grow my own fruits and vegetables. I make my own bacon, from pigs I raise and butcher.\nA sane, possible choice\nThis project is for people like you - people who live in the city or the suburbs.  Whether you're already convinced that there's a better, more in-touch-with-the-world lifestyle for you in the country, or just want to learn what your options are, this project has the information you need.  \nA tomato, fresh from our garden.\nThe good news is that moving from the city to the country is easier than you think... and it can be a lot more affordable than you think too.  If you have even a modest home in the city or suburbs, you can trade it for a much nicer farm or homestead in the country, with all the conveniences you're used to, at the same price.  I know, because I've done it.  I traded a 1,000 square foot, two bedroom 1950s cookie-cutter house on a postage stamp lot, for a 5,000 square foot, five bedroom recent-construction house...and it came with 40 acres of forest, 16 acres of pasture, and two ponds.\nI used to commute in stop-and-go rush-hour traffic and shop at an overpriced supermarket.  Now I work from home, where I eat lamb, pork, beef, eggs, fruit, and vegetables fresh from my farm - all of it higher quality than what I could buy at Whole Foods.\nYou can do the same. \nA beaver pond on our property. Good land is a lot cheaper than you might expect.\nAll you need is information\nYou can move to the countryside, work a good-paying job, see your cost of living drop, and see your quality of life improve. \nMost days half or more of the food we eat comes from the farm. Some days, it hits 100%.\nThe only tricky part is learning the skills.  When I moved to the country, I didn\u2019t even know what questions to ask. I had to learn thousands of things about tractors, gardens, compost, livestock, and more.  A lot of it the hard way.\nNow I've put it all in a book - two books, actually, because there's too much information to fit in one volume.  Absolutely everything you need to know about country living and homesteading, to help you move from the suburbs or city out to the country, and thrive once you're there.\nWhether you want to plant orchards and raise livestock, or just want to have a few chickens for eggs, my books will give you everything you need to know.  They'll tell you what equipment and tools you need, and show you the skills to use them. \nWe planted an orchard a few years ago. The peach trees are already delivering tons of fruit.\nWhy this book ?\nThere are endless books on gardening, farming, and homesteading - I know, I own hundreds of them.  All of them have three failures.\nThey don\u2019t have sufficient breadth.  One will talk about compost but not gardening. Another will talk about gardening, but not tractors.\nThey all have blind spots. Especially about the basic stuff. They forget that thousands of things aren't obvious to everyone. The difference between straw and hay, between sweet corn and field corn, discing versus plowing versus rototilling, pastures versus fields, the different kinds of fencing, how utilities differ from the suburbs to the countryside. A book on gardening doesn\u2019t tell you what you really need to know about hoses. A book on firewood might tell you to haul logs with your tractor, but not everything you need to do it safely.\nThe third failure is the lack of itemized lists and step-by-step instructions.  For every topic that I cover, there's a conversational discussion, but I follow that up with simple checklists, overviews, alternative choices for different price points or enthusiasm levels, and step by step instructions.  I also included dozens of recipes for every vegetable and fruit I grow, and for every part of every animal I raise, from apple cobbler to red wine, from beef fajitas to T bone steak, from Asian fried pork chop cutlets to head cheese and English black pudding. \nIf you've never had pesto made from basil picked from your garden minutes earlier, you haven't lived.\nThis project delivers\nThis is not \"here's what I\u2019m going to do\" kickstarter.  I've already written the book.  ...and I\u2019ve done this before.  Three years ago I kickstarted two novels I wrote, released them on time, and went on to win awards for them.  All I need is your help to turn the manuscript into a finished, printed book...and put it in your hands.\nYou\u2019ll get all the benefit of my experience \u2014 including dozens of misadventures, so you can learn from my mistakes.  Broken shear pins, logs jammed in snow blowers, bent tractor buckets, the wrong way to make vineyard trellises, invasive weeds and what not to do with them, trees falling where they shouldn't, broken tractor implements, trespassing neighbors, dogs barking at coyotes, dogs barking at bears, escaped sheep, and pig carcasses falling from great heights. \nThings break. But if you have step-by-step troubleshooting instructions and a list of the right tools, you can fix them and get back to work.\nAnd, of course, I talk about the pros and cons of farmhands, and why I really don't believe the one who told me that the Hopi Indians planted corn seeds 4 feet underground.\nOver the last decades millions of people have become more interested in gardening, ethically raised meat, becoming more self-sufficient, and having a lifestyle that doesn't feel consumerist, fake, and constrained. I\u2019m guessing you\u2019re one of them. Whatever your dream of living in the country is like - a small vegetable garden, eating home made bacon in an off-grid compound, or just having a bigger house than you have now and heating it with a wood burning stove - I'll tell you everything you need to know to plan realistically, and how to make your move to your country dream home a success. \nHeating with wood warms you three times: once when you log the trees, once when you stack firewood, and once when your burn it.\nCollaborative writing and early access\nIn these crazy times, a lot of people are looking for information RIGHT NOW.  It's my intention to share early drafts of the book, and invite conversation with the first 300 backers.  You'll get access to the content immediately, to help you make decisions about your own life in summer 2020 and beyond.\nThe books\nI expect the finished project to be around 1,000 pages of information - 800 pages of text, and 200 pages of photos, though that ratio could change based on a lot of factors.

The hopes and dreams awaiting them at journey's end are foremost in their minds as the wagon train sets out from Independence, Missouri. But the perils of the trail to California are many and exacts a heavy toll. \nFalling behind the wagon train, they decide to take a southerly route to avoid the winter weather. They're deep in the Nevada territory when this decision proves disastrous as they're forced to ground by a deadly blizzard. \nWhen the storm breaks, Colman spies a town on the horizon, or is it two towns? Colman knows it's their only chance and he heads out to get help. The Cooper family is forced to seek refuge in Dugganville where they  become stranded at the worst possible time.  The town is host to a deadly annual contest that has attracted a collection of thieves and killers from far and wide. Without his good wife's counsel Colman finds his way into Lead City. \nPitted against seven deadly fighters, Colman must find a way to outlast his adversaries in the anything goes, tooth and nail battle for survival. Who will win the richest prize in the West? A raven-haired pistolera with a penchant for lullabies. A jack Mormon looking for redemption. A Nepali man-of-war with a legendary blade. An Aussie sporting a mean Irish brogue and a chip on his shoulder. A Confederate guerrilla looking for a fortune. A Buffalo Soldier looking for revenge and a Shaolin Monk looking for a challenge.

Stop Starving. Start Thriving. \nDiscover how you can turn your art skills into your own thriving career in Illustration. \nFACT: Being an Illustrator is tough!\nYou have hopes and dreams to make it big as an artist; but you don't know how to make it happen. Still, you push along doing the best that you can. Yet, as you move forward you can't help but feel stress & anxiety about the future. \"Will I actually succeed with my art?\" \"Is it even possible to find an art career that will pay my bills and  fulfill me creatively?\" To make things worse, you sometimes cave into your fears because of social distancing and/or your past.\nWell, listen up!

Your successful career in illustration is possible. I've written a guide to help you make it happen. \nThese may be BOLD words from a stranger - Why can I make you this promise?\n\n\nMy name is Will Terry and I am a successful  illustrator. - I\u2019ve illustrated over 30 children\u2019s books for publishers like Scholastic, Penguin Random House, and Simon Schuster. I co-founded the wildly popular illustration podcast - 3 point perspective. I co-founded SVSLEARN.com with Jake Parker and Lee White where we teach illustrators all over the world. I\u2019ve created a thriving comic convention brand. I taught illustration and business practices for 9 years at UVU. I\u2019ve been giving entrepreneurial advice on my popular YouTube channel  for over 10 years!\nThe point is, I've made my own successful illustration career. I, along with 12 other award winning illustrators, will show you how to make yours.\n\n What They Don't Teach You In Art School is a guide to help you create new opportunities using your art skills to pay the bills, even if you have no prospects right now. \nIn this BEAUTIFUL 300-page fully illustrated hard cover book; you're going to learn:\nIndustry Insights\nYou will learn the most relevant professional practices I use in my career to this date. To name a few: How to find clients, how to price effectively and close deals, how to figure out which industry your art is best suited for, how to correctly invoice, industry mistakes you should avoid, and more...\nThis means you will be fully prepared to find and secure the right opportunities that will fulfill you creatively and pay you fairly.\n\nHow To Land Your Dream Art Job\nFor some of you, landing that nice prestigious illustration job at a famous company like Disney, Riot games, or DreamWorks is your dream. In this guide you will learn how to network effectively, how to get yourself & your art noticed, how to nail an interview, and much more.\nThis means that you will have a competitive edge over all the other illustrators out there trying to get the top jobs in your industry.\n\nHow To Get Freelance Work\nFor those of you looking for the thrill of freelancer life, I've got you covered. You will learn how to get the best freelance work, how to get your work discovered to attract more clients, how to correctly structure your portfolio, best practices to follow as a freelancer, and more\u2026\nThis means that you will be able to create the freelance work-hard/play-hard lifestyle you want, earn a living, and still have time for conventions and games.\n\nHow To Create Your Own Brand\nAs artists, what we want most is to be known for our accomplishments and abilities.

You could spend an entire academic career at an art university and still not even come close to learning the gems that are in this guide. \nLuckily, this isn't art school so you won't have to take out student loans to get access to this valuable information. For this Kickstarter only, I am going to give you access to a massive discount. \nI'll give you one copy of \"What They don't Teach in Art School\" for the price of $29 for a soft cover or $39 for a hard cover. \nThe invaluable knowledge of how to monetize your art skills and craft your own successful career all for a fraction of the cost of student loans, housing, text books, and Tuition. This deal lasts only for the duration of the Kickstarter. It will go back to full price afterwards. Claim your guide at a massive discount today!\nSoft Cover\nHard Cover\n\n\nSo What? Why should I care? \nThe vast majority of artists out there have the art skills to earn a living, but they have no clue how to monetize their skills; so they starve. Artists just assume that if they don't have any opportunities to make money with their art now; they will never have any opportunities in the future. This is false. They just lack the understanding of how to apply their art.\nWhat They don't Teach in Art School gives artists the edge they need to go out there and make a successful career for themselves. \nIf you personally apply the principles in this book:\n* You'll learn how to establish a career where you are both earning a living and creatively fulfilled.\n* You'll learn where to spend your time to get your career off the ground and save a lot of money in the long run.\n* You'll skip past mistakes and obstacles that inexperienced illustrators make in the industry today.\n* You won't have to listen to that naysayer in your life, you know the one, and instead you'll take life into your own hands.\n* You'll be recognized for your own content and your own brand.\n* You won't have to be afraid of the future and instead look at it as your oyster.\nFear is a tough thing to shrug off. It paralyzes you from head to toe; preventing you from taking the necessary steps towards success. The greatest source of fear is the anxiety of not knowing how your future will play out. But let me clue you in on a secret, the future is yours to decide. You have what it takes! Decide to make your future a bright one. I wrote this guide to help illustrators, like you, to succeed in the most challenging time of your life. It's going to take work, there are no shortcuts, but there are open highways.\n- Will Terry\n\nShipping & Fulfillment\nBoth soft & hard cover books are ready to be printed!\nBooks will ship to the United States & Internationally.

Can't wait to read another!\" - Frederick Knight \nHi, I'm Robert A. Multari, but you can call me Rob. It\u2019s been my dream since I was a kid, struggling with Attention Deficit Disorder and Dyslexia, to be in the comic book business. Comic books helped me learn how to deal with my learning disability. When I was 14-years-old, I wrote fan fiction for the X-Men and submitted it to Marvel in hopes that Stan Lee would read it. Someone from Marvel was nice enough to write back to me saying that Stan loves to hear from his fans and encouraged me to keep up my writing. As naive as I was at the time, it spread my passion for the business like a wild fire and inspired me to go to art school at Edinboro University of Pennsylvania, where I graduated with a Bachelor of Fine Arts Degree in Applied Media Arts. I have been working on Night Wolf since I was 16-years-old. The story and the characters have grown up with me, evolving into the amazing tale that it is today.\nWhy a werewolf comic book? Well, I have always loved any werewolf or supernatural related entertainment in movies, video games, etc. I didn't feel like there were any comic books out there doing werewolves any justice, so I decided to make a comic book based on a werewolf anti-hero myself. In high school, after I started developing Night Wolf, I got into Werewolf: The Apocalypse is a role-playing game by White Wolf Publishing.  I love the artwork in the game guides so much that I longed for them to put out a comic book to build on their world. Unfortunately, it never happened, but the artwork heavily influenced how I like my werewolves should look in my comics.\nCarlos Herrera is a Professional illustrator residing in Santiago City, Chile.

I appreciate so it so much!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI'm a relatively new creator and Night Wolf is my first comic book series. In April of 2016, I launched a failed Kickstarter campaign for Night Wolf Issues 1-3. I played the game on hard, setting a $20,000 goal. However, I did manage to raise $5,064 from my 74 backers, unfortunately Kickstarter is all or nothing. At the time I only had the character designs, a cover and 5 sequential pages during that launch. Even though the Kickstarter didn\u2019t fund I was bound and determined to publish my story. Because I didn\u2019t have the funds to finish the first issue, I decided to raise the money on my own doing freelance web design work to pay for the artwork. \n\nAfter self-publishing Night Wolf Issues 1 and 2, I launched another Kickstarter in October 2019 to print Night Wolf Issues 3 with a more reasonable funding goal of $5,000. The campaign successfully over funded, thanks to the amazing 217 backers that I refer to as my Wolf Pack. Now I'm back and ready for round 3 to print Night Wolf Issue 4.\n\nI know it seems like there's a lot going on all over the world right now that is very stressful for us all. Collecting, reading, and creating comics books have always been an escape from the stressful things in my life. My hope is that by creating my comics books and putting them out into the world for you to enjoy also helps to relieve some of your stress as well. And that is what I am laser focused on doing!\n\nIn addition, I have been educating myself through the Comixlaunch course, which is a Kickstarter training program created by Tyler James. Tyler is the Publisher of ComixTribe and has successfully funded over 17 Kickstarter campaigns. Through the ComixLaunch community I have also been a part of a ComixLaunch Mastermind group of independent creators that have all ran successful campaigns in the past, and I've spent time learning and being mentored by them.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "Digital Edition", "descp": "Backers at this level will receive the digital copy of Night Wolf #4 as well as this Kickstarter's video theme song MP3, Gone by Robert A.

Thanks to Sean Michael Robinson and The Waverly Press that wait is now over.\" \n- Dave Sim, 2020 \nEvery legend has a beginning\u2026\nIn December 1977, Deni Loubert published Cerebus No.1, Dave Sim's comic book that followed the adventures of a short-tempered, barbarian Aardvark. Originally conceived as a parody of Barry Windsor-Smith's masterfully illustrated Conan the Barbarian (which was a big hit for Marvel Comics in the 1970's), Sim quickly found his own voice as a storyteller and illustrator, abandoning the typical self-contained, single issue adventures in favor of elaborate story-arcs which would often span dozens of issues.  \nDave Sim at the Forest Heights College Comic Book Convention in Kitchener, Ontario, about a year before Cerebus No. 1 was published. Photo by Max Southall.\nThe dawn of the 1980's saw the popularity of Dave Sim's Cerebus explode, igniting a revolution among self-motivated artists and storytellers who were looking for ways to go it alone, outside of the corporate structure of the BIG TWO publishers at the time, Marvel and DC Comics. Dave Sim helped pave the way for countless other self-publishers of the day, including Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird's Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Bob Burden's Flaming Carrot, Jeff Smith's Bone, and Colleen Doran's A Distant Soil, to name a few... Along the way, Cerebus found its place as one of the most intelligently written, entertaining, and influential comic books of all time! Though the series ended in 2004 with issue No. 300 after more than 6,000 pages of story and art, Cerebus still enjoys an intense and loyal following to this day.  \nDue to popularity of Cerebus, original copies of the first issue now command thousands of dollars, putting them out of reach for most collectors. \nThe original Cerebus No.1 was printed on newsprint paper and after 43 years, most of the few examples that have survived are typically found in lower grades. This new edition is presented with fully remastered art, prepared by master digital restoration artist Sean Michael Robinson, and will be printed on premium paper for stunning crystal clarity! We are working with one of the best printers in North America to ensure the highest quality reproduction!\nRED - 24 Page Standard Edition. The original 24 page comic as it was presented in 1977, with remastered art. It's like owning an original Cerebus No. 1, only cooler!\nGOLD - 48 Page Expanded Edition.

Limited to the number of advance orders we receive. NOTE: Aardvark-Vanaheim \"Cerebus Archive\" patrons can specify their unique Cerebus Archive number for the Signed & Numbered platinum edition. \nPROOF EDITIONS - These are proof copies produced for final internal review by Dave Sim, Sean Michael Robinson and the Publisher. These final stage pre-production proofs that we are offering represent the culmination of all the work that went into developing the \"Expanded Cerebus\" No. 1. This is our way of sharing the experience of the final stage of production with Cerebus readers who will receive the exact same copies we will be reviewing before the book goes to press. \nRED (proof) - 24 Page standard Edition (50 Numbered Copies).

However, we plan to go to print in June and get all orders shipped in July so long as everything remains open. NOTE: Orders shipping outside of the United States may see extended shipping delays. In the event that postal delivery services are temporarily halted in any country, we will hold your package until normal shipping resumes.

But in addition to our main cover by Afro Samurai's Takashi Okazaki, we have... \nTHE BEN TEMPLESMITH VARIANT \nAnd if you missed any of our other campaigns for RED XMAS or PBOW, you can catch up with our ...\nBox of Fries \nMore details below...\nNOTE ABOUT THE TIME PERIOD\nDEADSKINS! takes place in the Wild West, and as such, some characters--particularly the villains--express attitudes that seem outdated today. We think our readers are smart enough to know that we aren't condoning these things, but we also know that in 2020, some people don't want to read about it. So: fair warning. \nThere's also donkey-f*cking.\nFRIED Comics is a proud purveyor of offbeat, irreverent pulp fiction since 2013, and a labor of love for Clay Adams and Alexandre O. Philippe.\nSo far, we have seven successful Kickstarters under our belts. (And between us we have a lot of belts. ) So, we're stoked to return to the scene of the crime.\nClay is a writer and filmmaker who's funded seven projects on Kickstarter with FRIED Comics. His feature script, THE ECLIPSE, placed second in the horror category of the FADEIn Awards, and his latest comic, ELECTRIC YOUTH, co-written with Kyle Roberts, was recently featured in the LA Times. He has written and directed for television and holds a BFA in Dramatic Writing from NYU. When Clay first met Alexandre, he thought, \"My, what a sophisticated European.\" Boy, was he wrong!\nFilm nerd/director Alexandre's most recent documentary is LEAP OF FAITH: WILLIAM FRIEDKIN ON THE EXORCIST. He holds a Masters Degree in Dramatic Writing from NYU\u2019s Tisch School of the Arts and has written and directed numerous award-winning films and documentaries, including MEMORY: THE ORIGINS OF ALIEN, 78/52: HITCHCOCK'S SHOWER SCENE, AND THE PEOPLE vs. GEORGE LUCAS. When Alexandre first met Clay, he thought, \"My, what a stupid American.\" Boy, was he right!\nLeila is a comic book artist and writer living in Portland, Oregon. She draws SLEEPLESS, SHUTTER and writes AFAR at Image Comics. Leila has drawn for titles such as THE WICKED + THE DIVINE, SCARLET WITCH, AMERICAN VAMPIRE, and THE PANTHEON PROJECT. In 2015 and 2016, Leila was nominated for the Russ Manning Promising Newcomer Award for her work on SHUTTER. She only took this job because she thought she'd be paid in fries.\nBrett Nienburg is a Denver-based artist who has worked as a concept artist for LEGO and  designed sets for feature films. We're sorry we made him peel so many potatoes. He looks pretty sad about it.\nCharles is from Canada, so we imagine he looks like one of those flappy-headed dudes from South Park.* He has lettered books for Aftershock, Image, IDW and Top Shelf (among others) and is a founding member of Frozen Beach Studios. (*As far as we know, Charles has a normal-looking head.) \nUgh. Just... ugh.\nThe Package\nWe've gotten our fair share of comics that arrived mangled by the mail carrier.\nYou pay premium prices on Kickstarter, and you deserve better. That's why we've started using Gemini Comic Mailers:\nThese babies are sturdy. They require a little more money, a little more time (and a lot more tape!) but it's worth it to make sure your comics arrive in pristine condition.\nAnd if somehow your comic still gets roughed up?\nFrieda will replace it free of charge.\nWHY KICKSTARTER?\nPLAY\n\nWe are coming to Kickstarter to put the first two issues into print. The book is 100% complete, our printer is still operating as an essential business, and we are ready to deliver quickly. We just need YOU to make it a reality.\nAll funds from this campaign will go to:\nPrinting rewards\nShipping them to you\nAnything above our goal goes towards making more comics\nImage copyright Can Stock Photo / pressmaster\nTHE TIMELINE\nThe Kickstarter Campaign: 23 days (Apr 29-May 22)\nKickstarter Funds Released: ~June 15\nDigital Rewards Released: ~June 15\nBook Goes to Printer: ~June 15\nBook Printed and shipped to us ~June 30\nPack and ship - ~July 1\nExpected delivery to US backers - 2 Weeks (Early July)\nExpected delivery for International Backers - 4 Weeks (late July)\n THANKS, HON!\nWe're not asking for a million dollars.\nWe just want to put a cool book in your hand and entertain you for a bit during these crazy times.\nSo find a pledge level you like and pre-order. We'll make more comics.\nOh! And finally:\nWe heard somewhere that Kickstarter campaigns do better when they have pictures of cats on the page. So, here's a picture of Clay's cat:\n\"Don't just stand there... refill it.\"\nThanks for supporting! And remember...", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe book is 100% finished.

Yes, the bakers dozen of Kickstarters. We are so excited to get the oppertunity to distract you all from the madness going in in the world and offer you our latest campaign! The crew at PAPERFILMS has put together an exciting new project that we think you will love.  Featuring some of the top talent in the field to present to you our 40 page first issue of an ADULTS ONLY comic mini-series called POP KILL ! \nInterior Art by Juan SantaCruz and Brian Reber\nWritten by JIMMY [ Painkiller Jane, Harley Quinn, Jonah Hex ] PALMIOTTI and DAVE [ 100 Bullets, Red Son ] JOHNSON and illustrated by the amazing JUAN [ Painkiller Jane, Twilight Experiment ] SANTACRUZ with colors by BRIAN [ X-Men, Bloodshot ] REBER, lettering by SEAN [ Aliens, Aliens vs Predator ] KONOT and the brilliant design by John J Hill , the man responsible for so many great projects there are too many to list, but for the PAPERFILMS projects, he designed the PAINKILLER JANE Hardcover and the KILLING TIME IN AMERICA hardcover.\nTHE STORY:\nImagine a world where the two dominant and competing Cola companies, each worth billions, are owned by former Siamese twins who are now separated and have grown to hate each other so much they hire assassins, saboteurs, and espionage personnel to meddle with each other on a daily basis.  This is the story about brotherly love run afoul, and the people they enlist to do their dirty work.\nMeet the beautiful DINA DELUX, a scientist in the Fizz division at POPSO COLA. She's on the verge of creating a formula that will make soda 50% fizzier, keeping it carbonated longer than any other brand on the market. A breakthrough like this would put all the competition out of business in a heartbeat.\nWhen Popso's main rival FIZZ ONE COLA hear the rumors about the discovery, they activate their best man, JON PYLE, an oversexed mercenary, to take care of the situation. His orders are to convince Dina to switch sides, and if that fails, to eliminate her. However, after they meet the attraction is undeniable and a third option kicks in, one which triggers repercussions from BOTH sides.\nEach book you buy will come with an official CERTIFICATE OF AUTHENTICITY pictured below with a variety of reward tiers consisting of 4 different covers being offered of issue 1 of POP KILL. \nUPDATE:  CONGRATS, STRETCH GOALS!!\nWe hit the second goal and below are the new stretch goals we hopefully hit over the remaining campaign days!

Prohibition, the Constitutional ban on the sale of alcohol in the United States, comes into effect.... And business couldn't be better at the Little Daisy Cafe.\nBut things aren't what they seem. Atlas May, proprietor, uses the charming little restaurant as a front for his real cash cow; the Lackadaisy speakeasy, where flashing the club symbol from a deck of cards grants everykitty in-the-know access to more moonshine than they could ever drink. Life is good... Until Atlas is murdered in cold blood.\nNow, it's 1927. Mitzi, Atlas' widow, struggles to keep Lackadaisy afloat, as the patrons drift away and a skeleton crew of staff sticks by her side. Scrappy young musician/rum-runner Rocky Rickaby, his wide-eyed but tightly-wound cousin Freckle McMurray, and the endlessly resourceful and sharp-tongued Ivy Pepper, heiress to the quickly-dwindling Lackadaisy fortune, are forced to make do in a world of increasingly unfriendly competition, intent on shooting, smuggling, and conspiring their way back to a successful bar, against all odds. \nLackadaisy Cats has been running online since 2006, immersing its readership in a world of sepia-toned crime, adventure, action, and comedy. And now, it's ready for its next big move... to a screen near you.\nWhy a cartoon? Why now?\nThere's never been more interest in adult animation, with shows like Bojack Horseman, Big Mouth, and Primal capturing the attention and imaginations of millions of viewers. \nLackadaisy is an exceptional webcomic, but in her mind, Tracy has always pictured it as an animated film. It\u2019s a side effect, perhaps, of a childhood nourished on Looney Tunes, Disney, and Don Bluth features; a dream of sharing that living, breathing, musical version of Lackadaisy with its dedicated readership. But the when-and-how something like that could ever be achieved has always lacked an obvious ingress.\nAs the 20s dawn upon us again, with new animation tools and techniques available, with talented and excited artists on deck an raring to get to work, and with the internet eager for more independently-created media, the auspiciousness seems writ-large - splashed across an art deco picture palace marquee, if you will. \nNow\u2019s the time.\nThe Lackadaisy animated short proposes a 10-minute, fun-and-action-filled adventure, full of car chases, shootout, sass, and  un-requested violin solos. And with your help, we can make it happen!\nThe finished short will be available for everyone to watch!\nMeet the people in charge of (and contributing to) the project! \nA former game dev, illustrator and graphic designer, Tracy Butler began Lackadaisy after researching the history of her century-old Saint Louis home, and being inspired by her love of jazz music and 1920s aesthetics. Boasting over 1,600 backers on Patreon, Lackadaisy has been her full-time job for years, garnering a dedicated readership of thousands. As the creator of the comic, Tracy will play a role as co-director on the animated short, as well as overseeing art direction.\nFable Siegel is a veteran animation professional, boasting a resume that includes Titmouse, Starburns, the internet phenomenon Hazbin Hotel, and two Game Grumps Animated shorts, along with storyboard work for Cartoon Network (Ben 10), Stoopid Monkey (Adam Ruins Everything: Reanimated History), Warner Brothers (Wacky Races), Shadow Machine (F is for Family), and more, as well as being a board artist, animator, and designer for Six Point Harness (Like Share Die).  Brought onto the Lackadaisy animated short as a production manager, director, and producer, they'll be overseeing the project utilizing their years of professional experience and skill.\n Our awesome line-up of talent, in no particular order:\n Michael Kovach  (@kovox) as Rocky Rickaby! \n Belsheber Rusape (@BelRusapeVO) as Calvin \"Freckle\" McMurray! \n Lisa Reimold (@lisareimold)  as Ivy Pepper! \n Ashe Wagner (@TheQueenViking)  as Mitzi May! \nand SungWon Cho (@ProZD) as Mordecai Heller! \nCharacter Design\nTai (@corvidmonster)\n3D Modeling\nZachary \"Newt\" Nall (https://www.noneuclideandesigns.com/)\nStoryboard Artist\nAshley \"Kilomonster\" Green (@AshGMonstrology)\nSound Direction\nM.

And will the Littlest Viking be big enough to rise to the challenges that come his way?\nThis book will be the first 24-page chapter in Beorn's saga. It will be professionally offset printed, saddle-stitched, with full color interior pages on 60# bright white paper, and 80# gloss cardstock for the cover.\nWe are currently working toward (and through!)

In the meantime, he\u2019ll spread his personal brand of mischief across his new home...a fantastical island where ancient myths, powerful gods, and magical fairy tales come to life. \nAs rambunctious and unruly as Beorn can be, he somehow manages to endear himself to those around him and forge friendships with an amazing cast of characters and creatures. None of those friendships is more special than his secret friendship with a little troll named Goob.\nSome of the first colored concept art for Beorn and Goob.\nI've been working on Beorn's saga for around a decade. It was initially inspired by my long-time love for newspaper comic strips. But as I was writing the daily strip, Beorn's world kept growing. His slice of life experiences couldn't be separated from the amazing and fantastical world in which he lived. Soon, Beorn's story was chalk full of Norse mythology, and Old-World fairy tales. Epic fantasy and high adventure followed this kid wherever he went! His curiosity and his thirst for adventure were insatiable.  \nAvailable as a signed print in Rewards below!\nBeorn was a little Viking who kept leading me down roads full of big moments...and big feelings. I fell in love with the cast of characters. It was a delight to see how their relationships with Beorn, and each, other grew.\nOf course, not all of Beorn's world was safe and welcoming! Outside the safety of the small village where Beorn settled was a Dark Forest filled with dangerous and mysterious creatures and beings. Sometimes they were misunderstood and harmless. Other times, Beorn found himself in very real danger! \nAvailable as a signed print in Rewards below!\nBut no matter how Beorn's world and saga grew, there was always one constant. At it's center, Beorn's story was about friendship. A magical friendship between a little Viking and his best friend who happened to be a troll. I have found it to be something very special, and I'm excited to finally share it. \nA quiet moment shared between best friends.\n\nIn this first chapter, we will see Beorn's first fateful experiences as he lands on the island and discovers some of its inhabitants. I hope you'll join me in seeing this project come to life, and enjoy reading Beorn's adventures as much as I do!\nBeorn and Goob out for an afternoon ride.\n Aside from the printed copy of the book, I'm offering some fun rewards to celebrate the printing of the first issue of BEORN!

I have worked incredibly hard to be aware of, and avoid, the common pitfalls first-time creators come across. I have done a good bit of research going into the campaign to try and understand how best to run a smooth and successful Kickstarter, and how to provide the best possible experience for my backers. I'm also lucky to have a solid group of folks in my corner who have all run successful campaigns, coaching me since long before the actual launch. \n\nI am starting small with this campaign, printing a single issue rather than a large volume graphic novel, so that the creative burden on my end is drastically reduced. And as of now, the entire book is drawn, and lettered, and more than half of it is colored and ready to go. As of the date of the campaign launch, that leaves me ample time to finish the remaining coloring and editing before the campaign comes to a close.\n\nProduction of materials always offers risks of slowing down a project. With all the social isolation, and small business slowdowns, or shutdowns, I have taken extra care to ensure the book and rewards are printed on schedule. \n\nThe location where I am having the books printed is still up and running. It is a small operation, and has no plans to shut down for social distancing as that is not a problem for their setup. In the unlikely event they do close down for some reason, I have another printer lined up already. \n\nThe rewards are all set to be printed, or have already been printed! A first batch of stickers is already printed and in my possession, ready to ship. And the prints are designed and ready to go to the printer. If something happens with my usual printer, I have a backup in line, and as a last resort am fully set up to print high quality prints in my own studio. \n\nTo better guarantee fulfillment in a timely manner, I have given the campaign an ample buffer.

Therefore, I've taken great consideration to make Bright Ideas, Dark Mind of the highest quality I can.\nOf course!\nEach physical book will receive a numbered and signed 3\" x 4\" bookplate, exclusive to Kickstarter! Pretty cool, right?\nI mean, since you're helping me make this thing I wanna make sure you have something you can't get anywhere else.\nKeep an eye out for an upcoming Kickstarter update where YOU can help choose the final art!\n \n  Hey, there! I'm Ryan Kroboth, and I'm an illustrator, colorist, and writer from Pennsylvania. \nMost of my art education has been self-taught through books (and later blogs). However, in the last few years I've taken digital coloring, lettering, art, and digital inking courses through Comics Experience. \nThrough these classes, I\u2019ve experienced a large leap in my artistic growth in a short period of time. The biggest being learning to color digitally, and learning about color in general.\nPerhaps one of the most exciting parts of Bright Ideas, Dark Mind is it contains just about all of my digital colors after the Comics Experience course. You\u2019ll get to see my experimentation and growth across the course of the book!\nI have a passion for teaching, and I love sharing the lessons I\u2019ve learned with others. And I\u2019ll be sharing a story or two throughout the campaign.\nTo bring you the best possible book, I teamed up with Dave Lentz to help me with the logo and the finalized design of the book. Dave has been a big help with Sunmaker, and you'll see some of his art in Bright Ideas, Dark Mind in our Cthulhu story!\nHere's a bit more about Dave:\nDave Lentz is a family man, letterer, graphic designer, and sometimes artist. When he's not making comics he's usually reading them.\nHe is a fan of Star Wars, Batman, Ninja Turtles, and ninjas in general. \nSome of his credits include Metalshade, Spero: Breaker of Worlds (coming soon from Source Point Press), and Arabella Damage (coming soon from Action Lab).\nYou can find some of the things he do here\nFew things get me as pumped as an awesome art book!\nWhat's not to love?!\nWhile some collectors are looking for a single image that resonates with them to hang on their wall, I prefer a book that collects the work of an artist.\nI love seeing the growth across multiple projects. \nNot only that, but I feel like I get more value from an art book. I wanna see all the art!\nAnd I wish more artists collected their work into books. I feel it's not a common thing in the comic artist space... I'm always looking when I find a new artist I dig! Seriously, every artist should make an art book!\n(You can ask my friends. I'm always bugging them.)\nWith my passion for art books, I'd love the opportunity to offer one of my own.\nReaching the point in my artistic journey to consider this is a bit mind-blowing, honestly.\nAs there was a point that I almost gave up on art.\nIn high school I discovered Deviant Art. This was my first window into seeing art from other artists. The sheer talent of the work crushed my confidence. In retrospect I know this is silly, but at the time I felt like I'd never be \"good enough\". So I stopped drawing for a very long time.\nAsk any artist and they will tell you drawing is a part of who you are.\nEventually I found my way back. And through the encouragement of my wife I finally took the steps of becoming the comic artist I'd always dreamed of being.\nI'm still learning and growing. Over the last few years I've released two self-published creator owned comics, done several anthologies, and had the privilege of sharing the worlds of other creators by doing pinups and a few covers.\nBright Ideas, Dark Mind collects developmental material and sketches of those pieces.\nAnd I'm hoping to raise money on Kickstarter to fund a print run of the book so I can share those with you.\nAt one point seeing great art crushed my confidence, now it inspires me.\nI'd love the chance to inspire you and others.\nThe book is already 99% complete! The only page left to complete is the one bearing your name as a backer.\nI'm looking to print 100 digital-press copies of the book through PrintLore.\nTherefore, most of the funds will go to cover printing costs. Kickstarter and Stripe take a small fee off the top, with the rest of the money raised going to cover shipping.\n \n   \n  Here's what to expect for the campaign:\nAs an avid collector of books, I want to make sure you receive your book in excellent shape.\nNot only will it be shipped in a Lil Packaging bukwrap cardboard mailer to keep your book protected, you will find it secured by cardboard inserts and wrapped in a plastic sleeve to shield it from the elements.\nBut the real secret?\nNinjas.\nThat's right. Your own personal package protector. These guys will keep your shipment safe, as no one wants to mess with a ninja.\nNo one.\nWhile I've done my best to attempt to select shipping materials that will best keep your product safe, I'm aware that things do happen.\nIf for any reason you receive a package at fulfillment that doesn't meet your quality standards I will replace it at absolutely no cost to you.\nI know there are collectors out there, and I want your book to make it to you in excellent condition.\n Thank you for the opportunity to share my project with you.\nI'd like to ask for your support in bringing Bright Ideas, Dark Mind to life. Please back this campaign today and allow me to share my journey with you!\nWith gratitude,\nRyan", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI understand what it means to ask for your support. \n\nThis is my third Kickstarter, so I (more-or-less) know what to expect.\n\nThe biggest challenge to the campaign is the outside vendors, namely our printer. I have nothing but confidence in our printer, PrintLore. I've worked with them on my previous Sunmaker campaign. If any problems arise, I have had great communication from the company and I don't think that will change.\n\nAll the shipping supplies have been purchased, meaning all shipping costs will be for postage.\n\nI'm very familiar with Kickstarter platform having backed over 300 campaigns. This helps give me insight to what a backer looks for and expects. In addition, I am a part of the ComixLaunch course which specializes in crowdfunding comics. With this community I have an experienced group to turn to should the unexpected arise.\n\nAnd above all, I pride in communication.

I would read the Sunday funny paper back to back for years.\nThese were the things that brought joy to me and my comics, the Dust Bunny Mafia in particular, is my opportunity to tell my stories and give back in comics form.\nI am coming to Kickstarter in order to create The Blind Tiger, a Dust Bunny Mafia comic collection because there's a supportive audience here that can help me grow my brand's reach and I know people need a to laugh and I know that my Dust Bunny Mafia comics can help with that.\nWhy did I write this book?\n  I love mobster stories, they are the modern day version of the cowboys of the wild West.\n This book proposes a world where mobsters may not be evil. What if they are not the corrupt ones after all? What would it look like if the mobsters didn't know they were the villains at all?\nWhat will the funds be used for?\nWith this Kickstarter, I'm looking to do a 200 copy first run of this collection. Last go-around, I was shooting for a 250 copy print run and was looking to cover all expenses of the project.\nThis time, I am only looking to cover the cost of the smaller print run, packing materials, getting the books delivered to me, and of course the Kickstarter & Stripe fees.\nWith a smaller campaign goal and less books, it should still allow for enough copies to fulfill the Kickstarter pre-orders and have some stock to sell at conventions in the future. \nMain Chapter: The Sugar Ban\nWhen a nationwide sugar ban goes into effect leaving citizens craving  sugar, Leo Veronisci only sees opportunity. Allying himself with the  Corvalus brothers to leverage both families to push his bootleg sugar to  the masses makes both families rich. Until a bumbling detective  accidentally stumbles into a sugar delivery.\nA Look Inside The Blind Tiger\nSo...What's in it For Me? (The Pledge Levels)\n  Get Your Own Mobimal Drawn Into the Book!\nAt the Boss ($175) and Boss of Bosses ($300) pledge levels, I will draw your very own mobimal into the book in an advertisement for the Four Deuces casino, run by the Dust Bunny Mafia. Limited to 5 characters only.\nProject Timeline\nMilestone Bonus Gifts\n  After we reach funding at each of the major milestones above, a new Blind Tiger related Dust Bunny Mafia mini-print will be revealed. Each print was done by a different comic artist, but I need your help to unlock them! Digital mini-prints will be sent to everyone at the Soldier level ($15) or above. Physical mini-prints will be sent with every Made Member level ($30) or above.\nWhat's left to do?\nThe Blind Tiger is 99% complete.\nThere is only one page that hasn't been finished, the Four Deuces advertisement page. Once the Kickstarter ends, I will be in contact with the backers at the Boss and Boss of Bosses levels to get started on their mobimal characters, and hopefully be able to draw them in during the two weeks while I wait for the funds to clear.\nOnce that's been done, I can send the files to the printer and then ship the books out once they're printed.\nLast year I brought my first project to Kickstarter, a mini comic collection, Based on a True Story and I can't thank everyone enough for supporting my work before on Kickstarter. You are directly responsible for helping me achieve this dream of producing my own comics. Please join me and back this Kickstarter to help my dream of making comics come true.\nFREE PREVIEW\n***READ BASED ON A TRUE STORY, A DUST BUNNY MAFIA MINI COMIC COLLECTION, FOR FREE BY CLICKING HERE.

In between launching the campaign again, I have re-worked several of the pledge levels and decreased the funding goal to reflect a lower quantity of books being ordered and taking on more of the cost for shipping the books out to you on myself.\n\nAs stated above, the collection is nearly complete. There is only one page that hasn't been finished, the Four Deuces advertisement page. Once the Kickstarter ends, I will be in contact with the backers at the Boss and Boss of Bosses levels to get started on their mobimal characters, and hopefully be able to draw them in during the two weeks while I wait for the funds to clear.\n\nOnce that's been done, I can send the files to the printer and then ship the books out once they're printed.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Associate", "descp": "Get a digital wallpaper created by Travis Hanson!\nINCLUDES:\nDigital Wallpaper", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2020"}], "stat": ["0 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "Goombah", "descp": "Get a digital version (pdf) of the main chapter of The Blind Tiger comic collection, The Sugar Ban, emailed directly to you.

I've used this to integrate actual science into over the top science fiction in the technology used to power a cyborg shark.\nI've wanted to write comic books all my life, but I didn't know any artists and didn't know how to draw. But I've always been good with computers. So when I had the idea for Shark of War, I knew I had to get it made no matter what. I spent the last year learning the different digital drawing and modeling programs that let me create exactly what I envisioned.\nWhy Kickstarter?\nThe book is 100% complete. The funds are to cover a large enough print run to get the book in the hands of many fans as possible.

I have a Masters in Creative Writing for Film & TV and have been working in comics for over ten years. Among this work, I created Cabra Cini: Voodoo Junkie Hitwoman, a character who had a strip annually in the Halloween issue of H!M Comics' IF-X anthology, and is coming into the Geek-Girl ongoing series in the new 'Tights 'n' Capes' 2-part Story Arc. I have self-published two The Almighties one-shots (a comedy super-team co-created with Mike Gagnon); released a 4-issue Geek-Girl Mini-Series through publisher Markosia monthly from Nov 2016, and ran a successful Kickstarter for its TPB, and then for the first four issues of the ongoing series, which are now collected in the Crime War TPB.\n\"My favorite comic and biggest influence is Grant Morrison's bizarre run on Doom Patrol,  which has helped inspire a number of weird and wonderful creations that, now we're ongoing, I am going to be bringing to the pages of Geek-Girl.  Weirdness such as The Hall of Diamonds, the Rat Fink and Groovejet: The  Living Party are all in GG's future, as well as the aforementioned Cabra Cini.\"\nColombian Carlos Granda is Geek-Girl's artist.

He left the Police Service to work in the Middle East as an Explosive Detection Dog  Handler in the private security industry but then (as you do) got back into the comic scene in 2008, when he lettered a small 6 page project called \"Camouflage\" written by Martin Conaghan (Fallen Heroes), later lettering Martin's Graphic Novel Burke and Hare.\nHe  now works on a number of projects for various publishers, and his most recent have been comics for the Unseen Shadows  Universe,(www.unseenshadows.net) and a Graphic Novel about the life of  Aleister Crowley.\nGeek-Girl #5's cover is by Sun Khamunaki,  a comic cover artist & illustrator from Victoria BC Canada known for her fine art inspired style.

Each game is designed to last for one session, but also can be played repeatedly, delving deeper into the story, learning new secrets, or just playing for fun where the whole table can level and grow together. \nCheck out the Free Sample Deck on DriveThruRPG right now!!!\n Khieron's Keep 29 Card Sample Deck \nMission Decks work perfectly as a cooperative play game. On nights when no one wants to DM/GM, or players couldn\u2019t make it to the game, this is the perfect activity. Map and Conflict cards take players through randomly drawn dungeon, facing different encounters, and exploring storylines. Monster cards and loot cards keep the party progressing, allowing the players to grow together at the table. Parties encounter NPCs and work their way to the Boss Fight of the Dungeon.\n Each Mission Deck has a built-in storyline that requires repeated playthroughs to be fully explored. When players tire of the storyline, map cards also have untyped maps designed to be used in any setting. Players can the map cards to enjoy randomly drawn dungeons again and again.\n In addition, DMs/GMs can use the decks as tools for quick no-prep or low-prep sessions. Using the Conflict and maps cards, you can build quick encounters in interesting locations as well as build quick monsters to fight against.  \nThe web-based App expands gameplay options. Parties can also use the App to load map cards onto tablets, allowing for the use of miniatures in gameplay, generate random loot, or generate random encounters.\nIn addition, while the conflict cards come with a prebuilt story, the App allows parties to expand on that story, tracing down different storylines. By adding in the code found on the map, the party can then play in one of several arcs that expands their adventures, dives deeper into the storylines, and builds up their capabilities. When used in succession, the app allows for the Mission Deck to expand beyond merely a one-shot and into a campaign.\nPLAY\n\nBuilt using the 5e Open Gaming License, Khieron\u2019s Keep takes players under the ruins of an ancient fortress exploring the mysteries that called to them. The deeper they journey into the keep, the stronger its hold upon the party grows. Ancient power, deadly challenges, and epic glory await those who journey into the keep.\nThe OGL has most of the classic monsters you are used to from your campaigns. These will be the Baddies you are facing as you go through Khieron's Keep, along with a few additions we have added of our own.\nPLAY\n\nHaedus 8B takes players deep into the Carbyne Jungle\u2019s Reknown-Galaxy, exploring a recently discovered research facility abandoned for millennia, Codenamed Hell\u2019s Gate. Parties dive into the base, searching for the lost secrets of the fallen Spine Empire and seeking to stake their claim. Rival corporations, horrific monsters, and a dark secret all threaten to the tear the party apart.\nBoth game decks are built with custom adventures, bosses, and multiple storylines accessible through the Web-Based App. In Khieron\u2019s Keep: Card fronts have images and quick combat information on the monster, while the backs have the complete stat blocks. For Haedus 8B, the cards have both the full stat blocks, and the front of the cards have Carbyne Jungle\u2019s Flip and Fight ruleset information.\nDigital Deck copies: Print and Play decks are also available, and each P&P deck comes complete with all the same cards as the print deck and the same access to Web-Based App features. In addition, the digital copy also comes with 8.5 x 11 PDFs of all the maps.\nMap Cards\nMap cards are two sided. The first is a setting specific map with details about the location, objects in the room, and a scale for the room to give an idea of the size of the area. The back of each card is a non-typed map, also with objects and scale, that can be used in any setting type the players or DM/GM would want. \nUseful both for cooperative play, or for running a game, the map cards allow everyone to get a good idea of the setting. Every map card also comes with a code that can be loaded onto the Web-Based App, so the map could be loaded onto a large phone or tablet. With the printable PDF of the decks, each map also has an 8.5x11 printable version for tables who prefer to have a map large enough for miniatures.\nEncounter/Conflict Cards\nEncounters for 5e, Conflicts for Carbyne Jungle, these cards deal with the challenges and stories the players face in the game. Like the map cards, these are a mix of setting specific cards and generic conflicts that will work for any setting. Because of this, the decks can be used indefinitely for cooperative play, or also as a tool for DM/GMs. In any setting, whoever is running the game can pull a map card, grab a conflict card, and then plan out a quick encounter.\nWith the app, different conflicts can also be added. Each deck has multiple storylines available, so players who complete either Khieron's Keep or Haedus 8B can use the web-based app to load alternative storylines with different challenges for the party to face. \nMonster/Target Cards\nEveryone needs a good fight, and there is no reason that fights need to be the same every time. Used in conjunction with the Conflict/Encounter cards, the Monster/Target cards allow for a different challenge every time the table plays the game. Each encounter is built differently.\nLoot Cards\nSure, you can find gold or credits, or possible a sword or mass driver in a fight, but that can get old. Loot cards allow for unique rewards as well as unique fights. Roll up loot before the fight, and all of sudden you are fighting a goblin with a staff of fireball.\nBoss Cards\nBoss cards are templates added to monsters cards, allowing for unique challenges to finish the dungeon every game. Every time you enter Khieron's Keep or Haedus 8B, you don't know how the game is going to end... which is exactly how it should be. \nNPC Cards\nIn the mission decks, not only will you face monsters, but you will also run into Non-Player Characters that will present unique interactions and situations. NPCs will make offers, ask for help, offer rewards, join the party, and possibly even betray the party. \n Decks are broken into Tiers, giving players the proper challenge for the level of the players and their characters. As characters advance, players can buy full decks to get more variety on their maps and conflict cards, or players can just pick up the next Monster Pack, getting new creatures and Boss cards to contest against, along with new loot specific to your levels. In short, you get the game that will be the best challenge on most fun for your party.\nKhieron's Keep (5e OGL)\nThe Keep Decks will be broken into 3 Tiers: Levels 1-4, 5-10, and 11-16. Each tier  will be offered also as Half-Decks for tables who only want the Maps/Encounters or the Monsters/Boss/Loot.\nHaedus 8B(Carbyne Jungle)\nFor the Hell's Gate compound, their will be 3 sets: The Alpha/Beta deck, the Gamma Delta Deck, and the Epsilon/Omega Deck. Like the Khieron's keep decks.\nDeck Options\nEach deck will be over 100 cards of awesomeness and can be bought Complete or as Half Decks. After players have completed the mission, they may find they want to move up to the next set of challenges or just add more rooms and conflicts to their game. Each Tier of decks will have a Map/Conflict Half Deck and a Monster/Boss/Loot Half Deck. So if your party is happy with the map and conflict cards they have, they can just expand their collection of baddies to fight, or get a new set of encounters, more rooms, and additional story.\nAll of the decks will come with a PDF Guidebook explaining how to use the decks, along with guidelines for dealing with parties of different levels/tiers, and sizes. The guidebook for Khieron's Keep will work for all the 5e OGL decks, as the Haedus 8B will cover all the versions of the Carbyne Jungle decks. (For those interested in crossing over, the backs of each PDF guide will include the information for the other deck system).\n$4,000 Stretch Goal Unlocked!!! - Face the Undead Legions\nAt the $4,000 mark, we will be adding undead decks with nifty baddies to both our 5e and Carbyne Jungle games. So any backer can choose to get an undead deck for either system! These decks will have many of the classic undead you love, along with some of our own creations you can enjoy as well as a nifty necromantic boss to raise your game (it's a bad pun, we know, we just don't care)!\n$5,000 Stretch Goal - An additional Storyline and Free PDF Deck for all $20+ BACKERS!!!\nStarting off, each deck will have 3 playable storylines: 2 deck specific for the level tier and one that is shared by all three.

Both of these storylines will also be expanding on the undead decks, with a strong Necromantic theme! Every backer of $20 or more will get a free Printable PDF copy of this deck!\n$6,000 Stretch Goal - \"The Nameless Terrors of the Void\" Storyline, Deck option, and Free PDF Deck for all $20+ BACKERS!!!\nAt $6,000 we will build a Lovecraftesque horror deck filled with unspeakable terrors, demoniacal beings of unspeakable fear, and other fun stuff! We will also add a storyline in the same vein as the deck and every $20+ backer will also get a free digital deck!\nCarbyne Jungle Decks\nOn top of the mission decks, we also offering the Carbyne Jungle starter decks as options. The starter decks have all the information for species, power domains, archetypes, along with the starter equipment for any character. On top of that, we also have expanded equipment decks, and ritual decks.\nDo you want to try out Carbyne Jungle? \nFor those of you who haven't tried Carbyne Jungle yet and would like to get a copy of the game, all backers can get a discounted copy of the core rulebook!\nBackers can buy a digital copy for $5 or a color hardback copy for $25+shipping (on the survey when you pick your deck after the Kickstarter, you can select to get one of these options if you so choose).

At this very special triathlon you will build your skills as well as contribute towards creating the three courses that make up the race. Tri To Win is a card game where players build their own board game. Everyone can see the race course, you're building it as a team. But only you know what skills your athlete has, this means each player is trying to build the course that their own athlete is more likely to win, and leave the others in the dust.\nAn example race from Tri To Win\nThe race course is different every game, your athlete's skills will be different every game, and so your tactics will need to be as well. Can you build the ultimate athlete? Good luck!\nHere's a lovely little gameplay video for you. Scroll down to 'Game Instructions' for written explanation and a link to the full rules.\nPLAY\n\nThis campaign is to raise funds for the first print run of Tri To Win, a card game where players build up the skills of their athletes and create a triathlon race made up of three courses which is then played like a boardgame. The game is 2-4 players, age 8+, can be played in 10 to 30 minutes depending on how you play and is a great game to play with family and friends.\nThe initial idea for Tri To Win came about 18 months ago during a weekend where my husband competed in the Blenheim Triathlon and we also went to the UK Games Expo at the NEC in Birmingham. After the idea formed, I left it for a while and the rules for the game started expanding in my head until I had to create a prototype. My sneaky plan was to create the prototype, iron out any problems by playing it with my husband and then get a single print copy for him as his Christmas present. It very quickly transpired that not only did my husband like the game, he loved it! Persuaded me that everyone else would as well and here we are!\nPlay tests have been going really well and I'm looking for local gaming groups to bring the prototype along to throughout my Kickstarter campaign so if you're local to Hampshire, UK get in touch.\nThe game is played in two phases. In the first phase of the game players draw and play one card per turn to build up their athletes\u2019 skills, create the race courses, and a little bit of card and skill thievery. Skill cards are played face down next to your athlete, only you know what skills you have. All other cards are played face up, the Course cards are played along the corresponding course (as in the image below). And Action cards are used to cause some mischief, with Action cards you can steal skills, cards, remove pieces of the race course and stop other players actions. Phase one ends when a player uses their turn to play the 'Start The Race' card at the end of the running course.\nExample of how the race course can look, using the new updated cards. I am gradually replacing the graphics on this campaign with the updates, stay tuned!\nIn phase two, players use their accumulated skills to race on the course they made in phase one. The Course cards are used as a board game with coloured player tokens that match each athlete. Add up all skills your athlete has gathered and these are now your movement points. Each player takes turns moving their token the number of swim points they have, then cycling, then running, stopping at each race transition until their next turn. The winner is the first player to make it past the finish line to the Gold 1st place position at the end of the running course. Keep playing to find out who comes 2nd and 3rd! We haven't been able to play a game yet without continuing after we have a winner; we just have to know!\nClick here for the full rules of Tri To Win\nIn the game box you will receive:\n84 x 310gsm black core playing cards\n6 x wooden player tokens, one for each athlete card\nWhat's in the box\n \u00a31 - Thank You - an extra big thank you to anyone who just wants to back the project without a reward, you will be able to keep updated on the project as it progresses.\n\u00a312 and \u00a324 - Early birds - I'd like to thank my first 40 backers who'd like one or two games, you can use these two reward tiers to get the game for \u00a312 each.

You'll also get any stretch goals that are unlocked during the campaign.\n\u00a314 - Get the game for less than the RRP of \u00a315 along with any stretch goals unlocked during the campaign.\n\u00a328 - Get two copies of the game for \u00a314 each (RRP \u00a315) along with any stretch goals unlocked during the campaign.\n\u00a352 - Buy in bulk - Get 4 or more copies of the game for \u00a313 each (RRP \u00a315) add an additional \u00a313 for each extra copy you'd like to receive, e.g. for 6 copies pledge \u00a378.

This also means you'll have your personalised cards as well as the original six athlete cards to choose from when playing. Your game will also include any stretch goals unlocked during the campaign.\n If everything runs according to plan then your rewards will be delivered in May 2020. However, I have set the delivery date on the rewards to June 2020 to create a buffer for any unexpected international delivery delays.\nUK - Tri To Win is a UK developed game and I'm delighted to be able to offer Free Shipping within the UK.\nRest of the world - discounted shipping to the rest of the world in the hopes that shipping won't be a blocker for anyone wanting to back this campaign. See reward tiers for specific shipping rates as they vary (for bulk orders for example)\nWe will ship Tri To Win worldwide. Please note that you  may be responsible for duties, handling, fees and taxes applicable to  your region, especially if choosing to buy in bulk.\nFunding goal - \u00a32,800\nWhen we reach this funding goal we will try and work towards the below stretch goals. \n6 players - target: \u00a33,400 - updated to be included at \u00a32,800 funding goal\nThe game is currently optimised for 2-4 players. It's not impossible to play with 6 players at the moment but the deck is not optimised for it. More cards will need to be added to make this a 6-player game. I'm very keen to reach this goal as I was set on having 6 athletes, two for each triathlon discipline. So, you're asking why isn't it 6 players to start with? It's more cost effective at the moment for it to be a maximum of 4 players, but it's not a massive stretch goal to be able to add enough cards for inclusion of 2 more players. Fingers crossed!\nInterrupt cards expansion (working title) - target: \u00a35,150\nThis adds an expansion to the game where a new deck of cards is used for phase two of the game. A card is drawn each time you move your token in the race, you choose when you play the card (at any time during the race) they all interrupt the race in some way. A player may have to wait an extra turn at their next transition or be stopped from over taking the owner of the card, you might get +1 for a chosen skill. \nThis expansion pack will be sold separately after the Kickstarter campaign but will be included for anyone who backs the campaign to get the game.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAll projects contain the potential for surprise and delay.

Join us as we tell the tale of this legend from Japan's rich history.\nThis KickStarter campaign funds the printing, shipping and remaining art costs of Issue Two.

Journey with us as we go back in time and examine the story of these legendary figures.\nAlexia is currently illustrating and coloring pages.  We will be adding pages from issue two in updates throughout the campaign to showcase her work on this issue and to give backers an inside looking into the creation process.\nVariant Cover Art by Paul Walcott\nOur campaign funds the art, lettering, printing and shipping/fulfillment of this issue.

Successful funding will  also allow us to order the press run for the printed comics on the same high quality stock we used for issue one!

Funds raised in excess of goal will be applied toward development of future projects.\nBased on costs and quotes from artists, printers and the USPS\nYou may have noticed that there isn't a calculation to pay the writer (me).  That's by design. I conduct crowdfunding campaigns to pay for the creation of the product/publication at the highest quality I can deliver.  I plan to make money subsequent to the campaign through sale of finished product AFTER the campaign is fulfilled.   If we fund well over goal I'll be using the majority of any excess funds to pay for production of art for issue three.\nShipping\nSince 2017 I have seen constant increases in shipping costs.  International shipping will be done via first class international mail through the USPS.  For all backers outside of the United States, please be advised that you may be charged import tax / VAT for your rewards upon arrival. We cannot and will not falsify the value information of your rewards, we must report that information honestly and will do so.   Rewards will be inspected prior to packaging and will ship to the address you indicate.  \nWhen completing your backer survey, please indicate the English equivalent for your address.  This is necessary to ensure accurate addressing for USPS first class international mail and to help me avoid potential errors with shipping addresses.\nI will ship to any address that is serviced by the USPS. \nThis banner was created under contract by artist Brian Lee\nFounded in 2017, Sinopa Publishing LLC is registered in the Commonwealth of Kentucky.  My little company exists to publish role playing games, comic books and children books.  I operate by funding product creation through crowdfunding campaigns and pay my artists/contributors fair wages.  \nSince 2017 I have successfully funded and fulfilled campaigns under this (my private account) and under the Sinopa Publishing account (set up so I can hand it down to my children one day).   Each of my successfully funded campaigns have been fulfilled.

She is in good health and we do not expect any sickness, but this is a point that caused a slight delay on issue one and I wanted to make certain that it was addressed in Risks.\n\n2) Print delays - Any delay in printing will slow delivery of finished printed products. We don't expect this to be an issue. Mixam provided our copies of Issue one well within their projected delivery date and we expect the same to be the case here.\n\n3) Shipping problems ~ Shipping is always a big point of concern for any KickStarter creator. We hand off the product and place it in the care of the shipping partner and hope that it arrives in pristine condition. To this end we take precautions, using Gemini comic mailers to protect comics and using the USPS who have proven reliable. The biggest challenge with shipping is in addressing.

Despite being the better athlete, Mike loses the final bout as he fails to overcome his internal conflicts. His struggle intensifies as he turns professional, making the decision to keep his relationship with Jude a secret to ensure that he has equal opportunities in the international sport.\nBut when Mike\u2019s first opponent makes a homophobic remark to Jude, his two warring identities are forced into conflict.\nMike Shepherd: Mike starts the book as a young, amateur athlete turning professional and is trapped between the traditionally masculine persona that boxing demands and the industry\u2019s perception of homosexuality.\nJude Collins: University educated and with a strong sense of self, Jude is both a lover and guide to Mike, as well as to the audience. Jude\u2019s academic approach to sexual identity offers a different perspective to Mike\u2019s working-class upbringing.\nVictoria James:  Acting as a \u2018beard,\u2019 (a partner who aids in concealing sexual orientation), Victoria is a soap actress and single mother who agrees to attend fights and events as Mike\u2019s \u2018girlfriend'. Initially only interested in the publicity opportunities, Victoria grows to care deeply in Mike\u2019s struggle.\nAndrei Bitaev: The champion of Mike\u2019s weight class, Bitaev dominates his sport and is thought of as a once in a generation talent. His fights are highly publicised, making it more difficult for boxers below him to gain media attention.\nAn analysis of modern identity, A Boxer takes artistic inspiration from the traditionally masculine art of American realist, George Bellows and contrasts it with \u2018theatrical\u2019 lighting techniques to create a sense of conflict and imprisonment within the everyday.\nPrinting and costs\nA Boxer has already secured a deal with BHP Comics for printing and distribution. This crowdfunding campaign is to pay for the creative costs of our fantastic team. Our funding target of \u00a325,000 is to cover:\n\u00a317,000: to pay the creative team to produce the book. At 100 pages, this works out to a cost of \u00a3170 per page. The writer is not including a page rate until all stretch goals have been met in order to keep this cost to a minimum.\n\u00a36,450 to purchase the backer's rewards from the publisher. This is the cost based upon the estimated number of backers required for the Kickstarter to be successful.\n\u00a31,250 to Kickstarter, based on their 5% fee.\n\u00a3150-300 to PledgeManager, according to their fees based upon the number of backers. \nShipping costs will be handled after the Kickstarter by PledgeManager, meaning that they are not budgeted into our costs. For more details on this, please see the Important Details section of our page.\nThemes\nWhen we initially pitched the project it was named The Boxer but we decided to change the title. We felt that A Boxer suggested the story was universal rather than specific, which resonated with us as Mike\u2019s journey is one experienced by multitudes of people. While cultural boundaries have shifted, sports are still one aspect of society that struggle to deal with these issues and confront bias. This was made clear by the experience of the Twitter account \u2018The Gay Footballer\u2019 (https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-49093329) and even the English national football team (https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/50212951).\nA Boxer details the experience of a homosexual man struggling to find his place between two worlds, feeling himself equally impassioned and alienated by both the boxing and LGBTQ+ communities.\nWriter - Dominic Archer: Dominic is a comic book writer and graduate of MLitt Comics and Graphic Novel s  from the University of Dundee. His work includes Love In The Time of Wertham, an analysis of the infamous Fredric Wertham \u2018anti-comics\u2019 Senate hearings, as told from the perspective of two books that fall in love; and The Architect, the tragic story of a man who designs supervillain lairs, and longs to be remembered, only to see his work inevitably destroyed by the forces of good. Dominic\u2019s work is available at: dominicarchercomics.com\nThe first draft of script for 'A Boxer'\nPencils - Gary Welsh: Gary is a graduate of the MDes Comics and Graphic Novels course at Dundee University. He is currently working as a freelance comic book artist in Scotland.  He recently worked with 2000AD founder, Pat Mills on Ragtime Soldier and was an artist on Scottish superhero comic Saltire: Invasion. Gary's work is available at: gw2000.artstation.com/\nGary's pencils for Page 5 of 'A Boxer'\nInks - Marc Casilli: Marc has two Master's degrees, one in comics and the other in film. A Brazillian artist, he works as comfortably on his semi-autobiographical comic Legit, as he does on the surrealist series Jesus Christ: Time Traveller. When not working on his own books, Marc also teaches comics classes to low-income communities in Sao Paulo.

Hassan\u2019s work is available at: https://hassanoe.co.uk/\nCompleted page, with Hassan's lettering.\nPledgeManager\nA Boxer will be using the PledgeManager platform to handle addresses, postage charges and rewards. PledgeManager helps streamline the delivery of rewards and allows the creative team to focus on making the book. \nWith PledgeManager, backers are charged for shipping after the Kickstarter. These charges are based on the weight and dimensions of your reward, which means more accurate shipping costs for you and no chance of the Kickstarter underestimating the cost of shipping.\nDeadline\nThe artists have set themselves a deadline of 8 months from the successful Kickstarter campaign to complete work on A Boxer.\nDuring that period, all pledge supporters will have access to a monthly creator content made specifically for this project. This will include interviews with A Boxer\u2019s creative team, analysis of the art and the creative process, as well as content exploring the themes and influences on the book.\nOnce the creative work has been completed and the book has been edited, the digital comic will become available while BHP Comics organises printing and distribution. If you are hoping to read the book as early as possible then we recommend backing a reward that comes with a digital comic. \nRewards\nThere are a variety of reward tiers available for backers, ranging from A Boxer in digital form, up to paperback and hardcover versions of the book.\nHigher reward tiers also come with a set of collectible postcards, featuring important events from the book and a variant cover by Robert Carey (Aliens: Resistance, James Bond 007, Red Sonja, Power Rangers, Batman/The Shadow.) \nBackers of the Greatest of All Time tier will also receive an original penciled page from the book, as drawn by Gary Welsh. But there limited pages available so don't wait!\nStretch Goals\nThe A Boxer campaign comes with 4 stretch goals to expand the book to a total of 120 pages.\n\u00a326,000 - A 5-page epilogue for Mike and Jude detailing the changes in their relationship after the end of the main story. This epilogue is already written and will be created by the book\u2019s artistic team.\n\u00a327,000 - A second 5-page additional story that explores the character of Victoria James in more depth.

I\u2019ve worked for almost all the American publishers doing the likes of Wynonna Earp for IDW, Stargate, Robocop, Lady Death for Avatar Press, Cowboys & Aliens for Platinum press, Green Lantern, Teen Titans and Scooby Doo for DC comics and 20 years and still going of works for Disney.\"\nSword of Justice #1, Cover A by Silvio Spotti and Vittorio Astone.\n\nSword of Justice #1, Cover B by Silvio Spotti.\nSword of Justice #1, Cover C by CB ZANE and YLENIA DE NAPOLI\nSword of Justice #1, Cover D by Silvio Spotti.\n NOTE: Updated pages are here!\nSword of Justice #1, Page #1\nSword of Justice #1, Page #2 & #3\nSword of Justice #1, Page #4\nSword of Justice #1, Page #5\nWant something?

I'm John Daniel Taylor IV, the Owner and Creator of most of the Top Secret Press products. We are entering our seventh year of making color comics, with over 40 successful and completed Kickstarters behind us.\n\nLet's talk about this Kickstarter...\n\nMost of the time, I have a list, but I want to say something first. \n\nI have been working with Silvio for some time now on the Sword of Justice #1 project. This project is created, written and owned by Silvio Spotti.\n\nIt's a project I believe in and one I have faith in as well as the creator. At the same time, as a publisher, I want everyone to know I have a firm hand on both the project and delivery. I mean that for myself as well as the people I work with. I've been doing this a long time, and I've delivered every time. This one will be no different. Everyone will get their Incentives. That's a promise!\n\nNOTE: If you want to hear more of what I have to say, you can see the video above entitled, \"Let's do the right thing.\"\n\nRight now, Silvio has pages coming in on a weekly basis. I hired a new colorist for this project and you can review her talents above. She is talented and excellent at her craft. She is also a new addition to Top Secret Press.\n\n1) ABOUT THE COMIC - Silvio has completed 12 of the 20 pages. He makes about a page a week, so we have plenty of time. The colorist has also completed the first five pages. All covers are done and ready. So, all is well on on the way. The rest is up to you guys!\n\n2) WHERE DOES THE MONEY GO? - As far as where the money goes, 80% goes to artists and printing; the rest to Incentives, Kickstarter Fees and Shipping. Every penny counts! I get paid in copies that I sell at shows when I promote the product.\n\n3) Sword of Justice #1 comic is scheduled for a April 2020 release.\n\nOkay! That's it for now! I hope you can pledge to help get this series finished! Thanks in advance everyone! You guys are great!

Though it is a happy reunion with Samuel and Granville, something much more sinister awaits her and the team.\nGhosts and Demons was inspired by my standalone short story, Here Abide Monsters, which was part of the Some Time Later anthology, published by Thinking Ink Press.\nFirst three pages:\nTHE BOSTON METAPHYSICAL SOCIETY COLORING BOOK\nI am so excited about this! The amazing Alejandro Lee has put together twenty (20) gorgeous illustrations for you to relax and color away to your heart's content.

They  live in an alternate steampunk history where ghosts and demons are a  normal part of life. Families known as the Great Houses control the  economy of the Great States of America while the middle class and lower classes sole purpose are to serve the Great Houses.\nThe original trade paperback is available in several reward tiers.\nWHAT'S IN THE TRADE?\nI'm glad you asked. Not only does it include all six issues from the original mini-series as well as the cover art, but it also contains a ten page  short story called, Hunter-Killer, and additional bonus pages. With art by Emily Hu and coloring by Gloria  Caeli, the story is set at the beginning of the House Wars (my version  of the American Civil War) and features the crew of a prototype airship.  I introduce three new characters: Gwen Warrick - Captain; Emmet  Rochester - Navigator; and Joaquin Medina - Engineer.\nThe complete sequential art version of Hunter-Killer will ONLY be available in the trade. The original six issue mini-series and the trade paperback were picked up by Source Point Press in 2018.\nWHAT ELSE IS THERE?\nOur two previous standalone sequels will be available as well. \nTHE SCOURGE OF THE MECHANICAL MEN\n STORY: Granville and Tesla are in a race for time to save Boston from a mysterious disease that turns human beings into machines.\nTHE SPIRIT OF REBELLION\nSTORY: Caitlin flees to Philadelphia only to discover a ghost, a rebellion, and perhaps, her destiny.\nNEW REWARD TIER!\nThis limited package includes a signed copy of Ghosts and Demons along with 4 pieces of Chocolate Covered Vegan Caramels adorned with edible printed yellow gears. 68% Dark Chocolate (single origin:  Madagascar) Organic & Vegan, coconut cream, fresh vanilla bean and sea salt.

Inspired by fantasy and the art of storytelling,  Holly-Rosing uses her imagination to create a fantastic story that is  both well-written and fearless.\" - Valerie Complex (Fansided)\n\"If you have a taste for an intelligent, well written, elegantly  illustrated award winning independent book, you can't go wrong with  Boston Metaphysical Society!\" - Alex Yarde (The Good Man Project)\n\"This very inventive series posits a totally believable Steampunk  world that is populated by appealing characters who act (and react) in  believable manners to the extraordinary events that swirl around them.\" -  Robert Sodaro (Comic Reviewer at Examiner.com)\nTHE STORY BEHIND THE STORY\nI love writing BOSTON METAPHYSICAL SOCIETY. Not only does it bring my  love of science fiction and history together, (which by the way, equals  steampunk), the steampunk time period allows me to address the themes  of classism, sexism, and racism in America in a thoughtful and engaging  way. For at its very core, BOSTON METAPHYSICAL SOCIETY is an American  story. And you can't tell an American story without including women and  people of color.\nIt has been and always will be important to me to write characters  who, though they come from diverse backgrounds and have different points  of view, are able to work together for the common good.\nOTHER REWARDS\nIn addition to GHOSTS AND DEMONS, we are offering the trade  paperback, the anthology Boston Metaphysical Society: Prelude,  the first novel set in this universe, BOSTON METAPHYSICAL SOCIETY: A STORM OF SECRETS, plus a NEW BOWLER HAT PIN.

(Click to Tweet)\"\nBret Juliano - Creator  \nBret Juliano is a cartoonist and creator of the all ages Dust Bunny Mafia comic, which has over 650 comics in its archive and Mobimals. In late 2016, Bret published Meet the Family, a Dust Bunny Mafia comic collection. In 2019, he successfully funded a Kickstarter for Based on a True Story, a Dust Bunny Mafia mini comic collection. His dust bunny mobsters have also been included in several anthologies including Unlawful Good, Forgotten Histories and Out of the Deep as part of the Let\u2019s Make Comics: Chicago Collective. He is an avid consumer of mafia trivia, both fact and fiction, and a passionate collector of fedoras.\nFor as far back as I can remember I was always drawing. When I was a kid, my dream job was to be an animator for Disney, but as I grew up, my focus shifted into the world of comics...newspaper styled comics especially. \nGarfield, Calvin and Hobbes, Peanuts, Zits, Get Fuzzy...I could keep going, but I won't. I would read the Sunday funny paper back to back for years. \nThese were the things that brought joy to me and my comics, the Dust Bunny Mafia in particular, is my opportunity to tell my stories and give back in comics form.\nI am coming to Kickstarter in order to create The Blind Tiger, a Dust Bunny Mafia comic collection because there's a supportive audience here that can help me grow my brand's reach and I know people need a to laugh and I know that my Dust Bunny Mafia comics can help with that.\nWhy did I write this book?\nI love mobster stories, they are the modern day version of the cowboys of the wild West. \nThis book proposes a world where mobsters may not be evil. What if they are not the corrupt ones after all? What would it look like if the mobsters didn't know they were the villains at all? \nWhat will the funds be used for?\nWith this Kickstarter, I'm looking to do a 250 copy first run of this collection. 200 copies of the standard cover and 50 copies of the variant cover by Travis Hanson. This should allow for enough copies to fulfill the Kickstarter pre-orders and allow me with copies to sell at conventions in the future. If the project is wildly successful and over-funded, I will look into printing more copies as the funding allows.\nMain Chapter: The Sugar Ban\nWhen a nationwide sugar ban goes into effect leaving citizens craving  sugar, Leo Veronisci only sees opportunity. Allying himself with the  Corvalus brothers to leverage both families to push his bootleg sugar to  the masses makes both families rich. Until a bumbling detective  accidentally stumbles into a sugar delivery.\nIt all ties in together... \nOne of the biggest influences for me with this campaign was planning all of the details, not just with the actual logistics of the campaign, but rather, with incorporating the small details that most people wouldn't notice or even know about. For instance, with both this campaign, and the book itself, the overarching theme is Prohibition. And the inspiration for this came from my researching of Al Capone, one of Chicago's biggest bootleggers. \nThis campaign was launched on Al Capone's birthday, January 17th; it's running for 29 days, which is just past Valentine's Day; and in 1929, Al Capone was supposedly the brains behind the St. Valentine's Day Massacre, which resulted from the struggle to control organized crime in the city during Prohibition between the Irish North Siders, headed by George \"Bugs\" Moran, and their Italian South Side rivals led by Al Capone.\nIn fact, I did an in-depth Facebook live-stream explaining all about it, which you can watch by clicking on the screen below.\nhttps://www.facebook.com/DustBunnyMafia/videos/207316790427776/\nSo...What's in it For Me?\n\nGet Your Own Mobimal Drawn Into the Book!\nAt the High Roller ($150) and Boss of Bosses ($300) pledge levels, I will draw your very own mobimal into the book in an advertisement for the Four Deuces casino, run by the Dust Bunny Mafia. Limited to 5 characters only. \n Project Timeline\nMilestone Bonus Gifts\nAfter we reach funding at each of the major milestones below, a new Blind Tiger related Dust Bunny Mafia mini-print will be revealed. Each print was done by a different comic artist, but I need your help to unlock them! Digital mini-prints will be sent to everyone at the Soldier level ($15) or above. Physical mini-prints will be sent with every Made Member level ($35) or above.\nWhat's left to do?\nThe Blind Tiger is 99% complete.\nThere is only one page that hasn't been finished, the Four Deuces advertisement page. Once the Kickstarter ends, I will be in contact with the backers at the High Roller and Boss of Bosses levels to get started on their mobimal characters, and hopefully be able to draw them in during the two weeks while I wait for the funds to clear.\nOnce that's been done, I can send the files to the printer and then ship the books out once they're printed.\nLast year I brought my first project to Kickstarter, a mini comic collection, Based on a True Story and I can't thank everyone enough for supporting my work before on Kickstarter. You are directly responsible for helping me achieve this dream of producing my own comics. Please join me and back this Kickstarter to help my dream of making comics come true.\nFREE PREVIEW\n***READ BASED ON A TRUE STORY, A DUST BUNNY MAFIA MINI COMIC COLLECTION, FOR FREE BY CLICKING HERE.

You are the head of an elite team of cryptanalysts tasked with breaking the infamous Enigma code. But you're not the only one working towards this goal. It seems that rival teams are trying to decipher it as well - and only one can gain the fame and recognition that comes with deciphering this near impossible cipher. It seems the fate of the war rests on your shoulders.\nYou better get crackin'.\nGame Features\nCode Crackers: The Enigma is a 3-5 player \u201ccooperatively competitive\u201d game where players work towards the same goal of cracking the enigma code. However, there can only be one winner. Whomever has added the most percent when the tracker reaches or exceeds 100% on the end of any given player\u2019s turn wins!\nWho\u2019s this game for?\nCode Crackers is a 3-5 player game meant to be an entry level game along the same level of difficulty as Catan or Ticket to Ride. Each of the game\u2019s mechanics are simple, but together they create a complex, dynamic system that rewards clever planning and creative playstyles.  It is a game that can be quick to learn but difficult to master! Cardgame players will find Code Cracker easy to pick up!\nWhile Code Crackers\u2019 board layout may seem traditional, it relies on it\u2019s unique tracker mechanic that shows the overall progress rather than each player\u2019s individual contribution.  It\u2019s great for people looking to transition from more traditional board games (like monopoly and risk) to more complex games that are still easy to pick up. With 3 different ways to play, plus characters with their own unique abilities, you can make the game as difficult or as easy as you want!\nWhat\u2019s in the box?\n1 Game Board\n  5 Player Cards\n  30 Coins\n  15 Player Percent trackers\n  5 Main Percent Trackers\n  150 Research Cards\n  85 Asset Cards\n  7 Character Cards\n  18 Event Cards\nPrint and Play\n\nHere is a print and play for you all to try the game!\nhttps://drive.google.com/open?id=1pO57k-4qmJkndFfNUi51lO3GGc9YTwDS\nHow to Play\nFull rules here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zqJoImC7arp3Oz1mdRmnb7zsCgjZuvoDfCKlo8jneMU/edit#\nPlayers on their turn will go through 2 phases: the Research Phase and the Investment phase.\nResearch Phase\nDuring most player\u2019s research phase, they will turn any active cards on their facilities clockwise from 3 descending to \u201cResearch Complete\u201d. When Research Complete is hit, the card is flipped over and the player does what the card says.\nFor example, if it says add 5%, the player adds 5% to their own personal board and 5% to the main board.\nIf it says minus 4%, the active player chooses another player to lose 4% and 4% is lost on the main board.\n\nInvestment Phase\nEach player has 3 actions during this phase and can choose from any of the following options. A player may choose the same option multiple times, but they must take all 3 actions on their turn.\nPurchase: Market\nThe player may purchase a Research card from the Market row. Spend gold equal to the number in the gold circle in the card\u2019s bottom right hand corner, then add that card to their hand.\nAlternatively, face down Research cards may be purchased from the top of each deck for an amount of gold equal to the number in the gold circle in the bottom right hand corner.\nImmediately replace empty spots in the Market row with the top card of the respective Market deck.\nPurchase: Asset\nThe player may spend gold to purchase an Asset card from the Asset row. The cost of the card is located in the gold circle at the top of the card.\nImmediately replace empty spots in the Asset row with the top card of the respective Asset deck. Make sure that the top card of the deck is face up.\nImmediate effects resolve as soon as the card is purchased. Conditional Effects can never be triggered off of an immediate action on the same card.\nIf it has an immediate action, the effect happens as soon as the player purchases the card. If the card has a Conditional Effect, it does not trigger itself when the card up.\nActivate a Card\nThe player may place one of the cards from their hand face down on one of their open facilities with the circled number on the back completing the circle on their player card.\nExpedite\nThe player may turn one of their active research cards clockwise, as if it was in the research phase.\nReceive Funding\nTake 1 gold from the bank.\nAt the end of their turn, if a player has more than 5 gold, they must reduce down to 5 and return their extra gold to the bank.\nOur Story\nCode Crackers: The Enigma was born over 3 years ago with a simple idea of adding and subtracting percentage. Stored in a closet for about a year until Rob, newly moved to Massachusetts, decided to turn this idea into a reality.\nRob went to Great Stories, his local game shop, to see how the game would fare, and it was a great success!  Spending the next year and half refining and expanding the game, it has been played hundreds of times by dozens of people.The reception has been extremely positive from people of all walks of gaming.\nWe are now trying to get this game to a market near you!

T. Titus Thyme and Bev investigate a church that had been struck by lightning seven times. Meanwhile, a small high school in Connecticut has a new hero tragically brought to life as she takes on a shooting in her classroom.\nSaving Grace part 1 is filled with wonder, battles, magic, and standing up against past forms of deity.\n\nDive deeper into the world of The Following Casework\nEnjoy a new take on faith and divinity in the modern era\n24 pages gorgeously brought to life in Full color\nThe beginning of this ongoing series\nInterested?

Through my study, I saw that art pieces were allowing me to see God in a way far clearer to me than treatises. Art brought on a new way to bring faith to life, and explore the nature of belief.\nSaving Grace is the starting point of what The Following Casework is going to be all about: a tale of belief, magic, gods, current conflicts, and the power and costs of faith. What do we gain when we believe, and what do we lose? The Following Casework hopes to bring these questions and answers to life.\nKickstarter has proven to be our best way of getting the word out to you, dear audience. The first issue of Saving Grace is complete, and ready to go to print. The funds will go to offsetting the print run cost, and moving us towards the next issue. \nThis is the beginning of a four-issue arc. With your support, we will be able to make The Following Casework a success, launching onto the next issue and beyond.\n\nWe love making comics. It is absolutely wonderful to be able to bring these to life. Most of the funds will be used for printing our books. We have set some aside to begin the production of part 2, and excess funds will help make it a reality. The more that we are able to raise, the faster we will be able to turn around and make the next issue!\n Thank you so much for reading so far. Enjoy the first seven pages of \"Saving Grace,\" absolutely free!\n\n\nWe have fantastic books coming to you from Arcane Inkdustries. Make sure you check out everything and get caught up on all of our works, including:\nPrint and digital editions of \"Saving Grace\"\nOur one-shot for The Following Casework, \"#INeedaMiracle\"\n\"Why Faith?\" a new comics anthology featuring 30 comics on faith, compassion, and raising awareness of belief.\nProse Books from Arcane Inkdustries, including \"Dealing with the Apocalypse,\" \"Demon Riders,\" and \"Born of Magic\"\nError 60D: Immortality Not Found Titus T-Shirt!\nThank you so much for reading about The Following Casework.

There are more preview images and information below, but I am also inviting you to enjoy the first issue of Kinetic absolutely FREE so you can decide if the book is right for you!  Just visit www.ycomics.net/kickstarter \nEnjoy Kinetic either Physically or Digitally!\nImagine you are developing superpowers, but there is just one problem...\nYour city already has a hero.\nBut that hero is a jerk, and he doesn't really care, so you think you can do a better job.\n\nHi!  I'm Bill Coulombe (pronounced \"cool - ohm\"), and for the last year and a half I've been pitching those sentences to anyone who will listen!  That's the basic premise for my behind my comic, Kinetic, an independent superhero story.\nI've sold Kinetic comics at any comic convention that will have me.  I've appeared at over 50 comic conventions and have sold over 11,000 of these books.\nJoin the hundreds who already enjoy Kinetic!\nNow, I want to take the story and turn it into a Trade Paperback. \nWe've packed the entire first story arc, issues #1 - 8, into one oversized book.  It's going to feature the first eight issues of Kinetic, as well as a cover gallery so you can take in some of the beautiful artwork of Jason Metcalf and Ivan Nunes.\nOne cool thing about Kinetic, that you don't see in too many comics anymore - it is the same creative team for all 8 books.  This even stays true for the revised pages for the trade paperback!\nRevised pages?!\nIn the first printings, there were a few pages that I put a mental asterix by.  I wanted to spruce them up.  I rehired on the original team to draw and color a few revised pages.  They don't affect the story at all - any changes are very minor.\nExample of one of our revised pages. Old on the left, new on the right!\nWE ARE ALSO INCLUDING FREE U.S. SHIPPING ON ALL PHYSICAL PLEDGES!\nNot familiar with Kinetic?  Shame on you!  (I kid, of course)\nBut good news: this is the best way to hop on board and read the full story.\n Here's a little something to help you figure out whether this book is for you:\n But enough about me.  It takes a whole team to put together a comic...\nWe have all put a lot of blood, sweat, and tears into this series, and we think it's a pretty great read.  But of course we're going to say that!\nHere's what some others have said about the series:\nBelow is a small preview from the first few pages: \nPage 1\nPage 2\nPage 3\nPage 4\nPage 5\n\nBut I just don't want you to take THEIR words for it, or even this short preview.  I'm inviting you to try out the first issue of Kinetic for absolutely FREE at the link below:\nJust go to www.ycomics.net/kickstarter and I will send you a digital copy of issue 1, totally FREE.  So you can go check out the first issue, and decide for yourself!\nKinetic always started with a simple idea:  I thought that it would be a good name for a superhero.\nI had written some comic scripts in the mid-2000s that never really went anywhere, but had never really tackled producing the books.  Back then, the internet wasn't as advanced as it is today.\nIn 2016 I decided that this is something I seriously want to do.\nNext thing you know I had a script, then some artwork, then a comic, and then a whole series!\nBut until now, Kinetic has not been available outside of convention sales or my company website, which begs the question...\nI have a confession.\nWhen I started Kinetic, I didn't think very highly of Kickstarter.  Way too easy for someone to walk away with my money, I thought.  And I considered it a source of pride to self fund my books.  But as the platform has expanded, I had two epiphanies:\nI would never walk away with anyone's money.  So...what exactly is stopping me?!\nAnd as the platform expanded and I have backed more and more of my fellow creators, I realized that Kickstarter is not just a funding platform...\nIt is an awesome community!\nI want to share my story with this awesome community.

By now you should have a good idea about the campaign and some of our awesome rewards.\nSince writing Kinetic, the last few years have been crazy (in the best possible way!).  I am very blessed to do this and hope I will continue making fun stories for years to come.\nSo now it's time to act.  Whether it's just the High Five Level, Digital Bundle or the Ultimate Collector Level, go pick out your favorite reward tier, and let's make this happen!

It was my first time on the platform, and I did a lot of things wrong.

I have also volunteered looking after cats in adoption centres for over a year. I wanted to create a book inspired by the cats I have met and get a collection of illustrations together. \n\nWhy hats? \nBecause cats are incredibly stylish!\nI thought it would be a fun way of getting a large group of cats together and show how unique they all are. Every single cat has their own personality, and all need love and understanding. I also wanted to try to raise awareness of rescue cats and those who work with and volunteer with them. Some are abandoned and unwanted and I thought it would be interesting to include some of my experiences within the book too, showing how rewarding and important it is to help cats get re-homed with caring owners. \nThe book also contains information on hats (some are quite unusual, such as the umbrella hat!) and some quite fascinating cat facts too. I hope this book will appeal to cat lovers, will make people smile and also encourage readers to find out more about the work adoption centres do to help cats in need. \n\n Original art available too. \nMy plan\nThe artwork is complete and the target of \u00a3550 is to cover printing/shipping. \n\nRewards\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Other books in rewards: \nDREAMS\nA 100 page collection of artwork. \nTHE MAGIC ACCORDION\nA pirate cat adventure.\nGOOSE VS MOOSE\nA story about teamwork and emotional well being.\nHugs for Mummy\nA deer and fawn story.\nHugs for Daddy\nA story about a lion and his cub.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe artwork is complete and ready to ship if the target is reached.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a33 or more", "title": "PDF of 'Definitive Feline Guide to Hats'", "descp": "A digital copy of the book.\nINCLUDES:\nDigital PDF of 'The Definitive Feline Guide to Hats'", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jan 2020"}], "stat": ["7 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a35 or more", "title": "Digital PDF Bundle", "descp": "Digital PDF versions of the following:\n'The Definitive Feline Guide to Hats' 40 pages\n'Goose Vs Moose' 32 pages\n'The Magic Accordion' 32 pages\n'Look Marley' 24 pages\n'Dreams' 100 pages\nSketchbook 40 pages\nINCLUDES:\nDigital PDF of 'The Definitive Feline Guide to Hats'\nDigital PDF of 'The Magic Accordion'\nDigital PDF of 'Goose Vs Moose'\nDigital PDF of 'Look Marley'\nDigital PDF of 'Dreams'\nDigital PDF of sketchbook", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jan 2020"}], "stat": ["5 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a37 or more", "title": "Physical copy of 'Feline Guide to Hats'", "descp": "Physical copy of 'The Definitive Feline Guide to Hats' 40 pages\n2 A5 prints\n6 A6 postcards\nINCLUDES:\nPhysical copy of 'The Definitive Feline Guide to Hats'\n2 x A5 prints\n6 A6 postcards", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jan 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["30 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a312 or more", "title": "Physical copy and promo/PDF set", "descp": "Physical copy of 'The Definitive Feline Guide to Hats'\nPromotional set and Digital PDF bundle\nINCLUDES:\nPhysical copy of 'The Definitive Feline Guide to Hats'\n2 x A5 prints\n6 A6 postcards\nDigital PDF of 'Dreams'\nDigital PDF of 'Goose Vs Moose'\nDigital PDF of 'Look Marley'\nDigital PDF of 'The Definitive Feline Guide to Hats'\nDigital PDF of 'The Magic Accordion'\nDigital PDF of sketchbook\n1 x Top Hat cat coaster\n1 x Feline Guide to Hats Magnet\n1 x Cap and Bells Cat badge", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jan 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["16 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a317 or more", "title": "Photo of your rescue cat in the book", "descp": "Physical copy of 'The Definitive Feline Guide to Hats'\nPromotional set and Digital PDF bundle\nPhoto of your adopted cat -

After Welles's first interaction with \"Martians\", he joins an organization that defends Earth from extraterrestrial threats and lives a double life as a film director by day, alien-hunter by night. This Kickstarter campaign is for Volume 1, which tells the first half of the story.\nEach chapter of the graphic novel is illustrated in a different style, often as an homage to one of the many films of Orson Welles. The structure of the story is inspired by Citizen Kane. When Orson Welles dies, he leaves Paula, a lifelong friend and filmmaking collaborator, a clue that leads her to search for answers to many mysteries Welles left behind. She soon finds herself in over her head - amidst secret government agents, laser guns, and powerful alien technology. Her curiosity puts her on an irresistible path to adventure. Film lovers will find several easter eggs and Welles aficionados will notice thematic parallels between our alien-hunting warrior and the maverick film director.\nVolume 1 will include approx. 85 pages of art and story, a mixture of black and white and full color. \nPreview art pages: \nDouble-page splash by Erik Whalen:\nTwo pages from a chapter with Welles in Brazil in 1942, art by Martyn Lorbiecki:\n Here is the cover and the first five pages of Orson Welles: Warrior of the Worlds :\n\n\nOrson Welles: Warrior of the Worlds is written by Milton Lawson, the writer of Roger Ebert and Me (Ghost City Competition Finalist), Winter Sale, and Thompson Heller: Detective Interstellar. \nThe team of artists on Orson Welles: Warrior of the Worlds has been assembled to bring an array of visual styles to the story - with the art for individual chapters often being inspired by films from Welles's work as a film director. The artists in the book are: \n\n\nThe lettering for Orson Welles: Warrior of the Worlds will be by: \nVIDEO ART TEAM\nThe promo video for the Kickstarter uses illustrations by Dave Chisholm and Christopher Doray. If Volume 1 is successfully funded, there's a good chance you'll see both of them again, contributing chapters to that volume in 2021.\n\n\n EXTRA SPECIAL THANKS \n\nSpecial thanks to Maurice LaMarche for providing the audio narration for our video. DISCLAIMER: The narration in this video is fictional, any similarity to any historical figures is simply due to the marvelous vocal talents of Mr. LaMarche. \nBUDGET BREAKDOWN\nWhere does the money from the crowdfunding go? Funny you should ask, we've got a pie chart for you that shows where the funding money goes:", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe biggest challenge for the project will be maintaining the original artist lineup 100% as planned. We've given ourselves enough of a delivery window to overcome most scheduling conflicts, but, the comic industry is unpredictable and it's possible one of the team members will need to leave or delay their contribution until the second volume. We already have a roster of amazing talent already helping the project in various ways, including prep work for volume two, so if one of the collaborators has to change, we will be able to do so swiftly and be able to maintain a high level of quality.\n\nThis is my first Kickstarter project, but I have delivered two comic shorts, one of which was a finalist for the Ghost City competition. I've also completed a three-issue miniseries which has a publishing deal and is expected to be in comic book shops in 2020. Since there are multiple artists on the project, once it is funded, all of them can begin work simultaneously, and make progress quickly. We hope to deliver ahead of schedule.

It\u2019s been my dream since I was a kid, struggling with Attention Deficit Disorder and Dyslexia, to be in the comic book business. Comic books helped me learn how to deal with my learning disability. When I was 14-years-old, I wrote fan fiction for the X-Men and submitted it to Marvel in hopes that Stan Lee would read it. Someone from Marvel was nice enough to write back to me saying that Stan loves to hear from his fans and encouraged me to keep up my writing. As naive as I was at the time, it spread my passion for the business like a wild fire and inspired me to go to art school at Edinboro University of Pennsylvania, where I graduated with a Bachelor of Fine Arts Degree in Applied Media Arts. I have been working on Night Wolf since I was 16-years-old. The story and the characters have grown up with me, evolving into the amazing tale that it is today.\nWhy a werewolf comic book? Well, I have always loved any werewolf or supernatural related entertainment in movies, video games, etc. I didn't feel like there were any comic books out there doing werewolves any justice, so I decided to make a comic book based on a werewolf anti-hero myself. In high school, after I started developing Night Wolf, I got into Werewolf: The Apocalypse is a role-playing game by White Wolf Publishing.  I love the artwork in the game guides so much that I longed for them to put out a comic book to build on their world. Unfortunately, it never happened, but the artwork heavily influenced how I like my werewolves should look in my comics.\nOscar is a professional illustrator residing in Lima, Per\u00fa.

The Mystery Boxes will be BUBBLE WRAPPED before being inserted into a second shipping box, so that it arrives in great condition. \nFurthermore, for this campaign, I will be handling fulfillment 100% in-house. I want to make sure that everything arrives to you as quickly as possible and limit the possibility of unforeseen delays, which is why I will be rolling up my sleeves to personally overseeing fulfillment for every backer. \nI would like to personally thank you in advance for backing this project and joining the Wolf Pack!

Scroll back up this page, choose a howling reward, and pledge to be a part of this campaign today. Again, thank you, for taking this creative journey with me. I appreciate so it so much!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI'm a relatively new creator and Night Wolf is my first comic book series. In April of 2016, I launched a failed Kickstarter campaign for Night Wolf Issues 1-3. I played the game on hard, setting a $20,000 goal. However, I did manage to raise $5,064 from my 74 backers, unfortunately Kickstarter is all or nothing. At the time I only had the character designs, a cover and 5 sequential pages during that launch. Even though the Kickstarter didn\u2019t fund I was bound and determined to publish my story. Because I didn\u2019t have the funds to finish the first issue, I decided to raise the money on my own doing freelance web design work to pay for the artwork. Since then I have published both Night Wolf Issues 1 and 2 in both print and digital formats. Now, I stand ready to publish Night Wolf Issue 3, I\u2019m more prepared and more determined than ever to fund this Kickstarter.\n\nIn addition, I have been educating myself through the Comixlaunch course, which is a Kickstarter training program created by Tyler James. Tyler is the Publisher of ComixTribe and has successfully funded over 17 Kickstarter campaigns. Through the ComixLaunch community I have also been a part of a ComixLaunch Mastermind group of independent creators that have all ran successful campaigns in the past, and I've spent time learning and being mentored by them.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "Digital Edition", "descp": "Backers at this level will receive the digital copy of Night #3 as well as this Kickstarter's video theme song MP3, Shadows by Robert A.

Lovecraft's Dreamlands and thought...\"I wish this was funnier and gorier\"?\nAre you excited by stories that keep you on your toes and make you question the very fabric of reality?\nThen you are going to love Ichabod Jones Monster Hunter. Ichabod comes from a deep, almost primordial, place in my soul. It's the part that devours movies like In the Mouth of Madness, Event Horizon, and Jacob's Ladder, while still binging on Gravity Falls, Frankenweenie, and Army of Darkness. It's the part that read Johnny the Homicidal Maniac and laughed hysterically at every gruesome scene. \nAll of that went into Ichabod Jones Monster Hunter, which is what has made it my most beloved property, and for the first time since it released in 2014...there are more issues, written and drawn by the original creative team. \nThat's right. Renzo Podesta is back on art for the fifth issue (and the whole second arc). Renzo brings so much to the look of the book, and turns Ichabod from a creepy psychopath into a lovable character...who is also a bit creepy. \nWe're now ready to release the single issue of Ichabod Jones Monster Hunter #5, a 32-page ode to monsters and monster hunters, which starts the second arc of the series.\nThis Kickstarter is to fund TWO different print jobs. \n The 96-page paperback re-release of volume 1 (containing issues 1-4), Ichabod Jones Monster Hunter: A Psychopath's Work is Never Done.  \nThe 32-page fifth issue of the book, single issue comic, which starts the second arc and is independent of the first trade paperback.\nWhat is the story about, really? \nA lot of people told me when the book came out that it wasn't the right time for a book about a psychopath. \nHonestly, I think that criticism would be even more valid right now. However, I think those people are missing the point. \nIchabod isn't about a psychopath who's ruthlessly killing people. It's about a broken man, who was cast off by society, and whether that person, a person who nobody wants, can be a hero. \nCan he find his place in the world? Can he come to terms with everything that he's done? Can he become a hero? \nI'm very interested in that idea, as a person who is severely broken myself. I've had depression and anxiety for as long as I can remember, and it's getting worse with every passing year. \nI never felt like I fit in for the first 30 years of my life. It wasn't until I went out into the world and became the hero of my own story that I started to think that maybe I wasn't the worst human being on the planet. \nIchabod, though, came from a place where I was very much alone, broken, and wondering if it would ever get better. \nI think what makes Ichabod really special is that is was started by a person who never knew if he could be fixed, one who felt like he was cast off from society, and now it's being written by a person who understands that the broken bits are what make him special. \nSee, Ichabod, at its core, is about hope. It's about taking what's special about you and using it to bring light into the world; of shining hope in a bleak universe. Ichabod's world is harrowing and awful, but Ichabod can bring light into it, not despite of being broken, but because of it. \nA psychological mind screw\nIchabod Jones is about a psychopath that escapes from a mental asylum and becomes a monster hunter during the Apocalypse, but he doesn't know if he's killing monsters, humans, or it's all in his head the whole time. \nIchabod has been imprisoned in a mental asylum for crimes he definitely committed. When he was arrested, the police found him wrist deep in the guts of his latest victim. \nWhile he's never claimed he was innocent, he says he only committed atrocious acts because an authoritative, and unwelcome, voice in his head told him he was doing God's work. \nHe tried to say no to the voice, but it was very insistent and persuasive. It told Ichabod that the people he was killing were monsters and he was saving the world by murdering them. \nHe was wrong...or so he thought. \nAt the beginning of the story, Ichabod wakes up in the Apocalypse, being chased by a monster trying to devour his soul. He has no choice but to use his training as a monster hunter to fight off the beast, and accept his fate as the savior of the world. \nHe meets a band of other inmates, helps them escape the asylum, and they begin their long journey across the desert to freedom, trying to carve out a bit of humanity as they go. \nSomething strange happens to Ichabod throughout the story, and I say strange in a tale that is already at 11 on the strange meter. \nEvery now and then...he snaps back to another place, where he's sitting with the his doctor, talking out what just happened to him, or on the run from the law, and definitely NOT in the Apocalypse. \n Is he really there, is it a memory, or is he having a psychological break? \nIt's that juxtaposition between reality and perception that makes Ichabod special. It's not just an Apocalypse story, or a dark fantasy, or a chosen one book. It also messing with your very perception of the universe, and whether Ichabod is truly a hero, or a psychopath killing the innocent. \nAfter all, he was wrong about being a savior once, and that's what got him locked away in the first place. What's to say he's not wrong again, only now he's having a much more vivid hallucination?\nOr perhaps he's only fantasizing about being a hero, while being locked in his cell, unable to smell freedom ever again. \nWhat's new in the fifth issue? \nThe fifth issues starts the second arc of Ichabod Jones Monster Hunter. Once the second arc is complete, the fifth issue will be bound in a second trade paperback along with issues #6-8, which are currently in production. \nWhile it continues the story, for printing purposes the fifth issue is completely independent from the first trade paperback that is also funding during this campaign. \nThe volume one trade will be printed as a 96-page softcover (unless we hit our stretch goal), while the fifth issue will be printed as a 32-page, single issue floppy comic.\nWe are introducing a new character, and maybe my favorite of all time...Necromonica, the first wizard of the Apocalypse. \nYes, the book is going full dark fantasy with issue 5, and what better way to go fantasy than to introduce our Gandalf. Necromonica is a blast to write and it takes less than a page to fall in love with her. \nAlso, NEW MONSTERS! \nIt's not an Ichabod story without tons of new monsters, and I can't wait to introduce you to the NIGHTMARE ELVES in issue #5!\nAnd so much more. \nWho am I? \nMy name is Russell Nohelty, USA Today bestselling author and publisher of Wannabe Press, a small press that creates weird books for weird people, creator of Katrina Hates Dead Shit, Ichabod Jones Monster Hunter, and Pixie Dust, along with the editor of both the Monsters and other Scary Shit, and Cthulhu is Hard to Spell anthologies.  \nI have raised over $100,000 on Kickstarter from 8 different projects, and have gotten exceedingly good at crafting amazing books which audiences love. My previous project, Cthulhu is Hard to Spell, raised over $39,000 on Kickstarter from over 1,000 backers, and the two before that, Monsters and Other Scary Shit and Pixie Dust, both raised north of $25,000 from over 600 backers each. \nI have a simple motto when it comes to Kickstarter. I outlay all the money to get the book print ready, and then I bring it to my audience and try to raise finishing funds for the book.\nWho drew that dope art? \nRenzo Podesta is a bit of a king maker in indie comics. I didn't know it when I first started working together, but Renzo has helped some of the coolest comic creators on the planet build their careers. \nHe's worked with Charles Soule on a book called 27 from Image Comics. From that book, Charles started working with Marvel, and has written Death of Wolverine, X-Men, Poe Dameron, Han Solo, and a bunch of books for them. \nHe's also worked with Jeremy Holt, who has several books out with Insight Editions, including After Houdini and Skinned, and Skip to the End for Heavy Metal. \nHe was also the original artist on Howard Lovecraft and the Frozen Kingdom before it was picked up as an animated movie. \nI met Renzo all the way back in 2010, well before I was a name anything. In fact, he was producing the first issue arc for me while he was producing the second arc of 27 for Charles, and well before Charles was even at Marvel, which seems like two lifetimes ago. \nHe's one of my favorite artists, and he's the reason Ichabod became such a beloved character. He took a psychopath who could have easily come across as evil and creepy, and turned him into an enduring, lovable person. \nAre there any variants? Maybe from Walter Ostlie? \nYou betcha. Your bro and mine Walter Ostlie from Metalshark Bro did a dope variant cover for this issue, and it's exclusively going to be printed for THIS issue alone. \nI'm printing it to order (with a small over run in case of defects and additional fulfillment orders) for this issue alone and then I'm never printing it on any cover again. \nPretty exclusive right? Here's a mockup of what it will look like when printed. I looove this cover. \nIf you love Walter's work, definitely pledge at least at the variant level, but I tried to do make a cool combo which has both variants (or both variants and the first volume) and a cool pin designed by Aaron Alexovich for $40. \nAaron is an artist on Invader Zim, creator of Serenity Rose and It's Not Scary, and cover artist for both the Monsters and Other Scary Shit and Cthulhu is Hard to Spell anthologies. \nIf you want a preview of the pin, just scroll down toward the bottom of the page. \nWhy did I write this book? \nI still remember the moment I came up with the idea for Ichabod Jones Monster Hunter. \nI had just returned from San Diego Comic-Con 2010, after pitching my book, The Wannabes, a YA superhero story about fake superheroes who get real superpowers. Everybody, and I mean everybody, rejected it. \nThey said it was too cute, or not cute enough, but most often they just flat out told me no without any explanation. So, I came home, disillusioned, and I told myself \"If they're going to tell me no, I'll give them a good reason to say no.\" \nI set out to make the most unlikely hero imaginable. Something unpublishable by the standards of any conventional publisher. \nI didn't know the story yet. I just knew I wanted it to be my big screw you to publishing, and everybody who told me no. \nThen, it happened. \nI was cresting over the hill to the valley on the 405 in late 2010, looking out on the city below me, and that's when it hit me like a ton of bricks. \nWhat if the hero was a psychopath, somebody that society had written off for being objectively evil? What if he didn't even know if he was in his own head or the Apocalypse was really happening? \nCould a person like that...could they be a hero? \nIcbabod Jones is the exploration of that question. \nWhat's the history of the book's production? \nI originally wrote Ichabod Jones issues 1-4 in 2010, when I was 27 years old. It was right around this time of year in fact. Originally, I asked Renzo Podesta to do five sample pages to pitch to publishers.\nEven though I was furious about being rejected by them, back then I still craved the validation of publishers. It took me years to shake that monkey off my back and realize that the existence of my work validated itself.\nI pitched it EVERYWHERE. I figured everyone would say no, but was surprised when Viper Comics said they would take a chance on it, if only for a digital run of the book. \nFunny, right? My big screw off to publishers actually got me a publisher. Weird how that happened. \nSo, I set about making Ichabod #1-4, expecting never to recoup a single dime of the money it took to produce the book. \nI didn't care. I just loved it so much. \nWe finished production on the book in 2012, and took the first issue to San Diego Comic-Con that year, where it sold out of it's original production run. \nIt was my first signing at SDCC, and I will never forget it.\nViper Comics does not publish this book anymore, and hasn't since 2012, so, once I got the rights back, I took it to Kickstarter in 2014. \nWith the funds from the campaign. I purchased 1,000 copies of the trade paperback and started my company, Wannabe Press. It was an homage to my first book, The Wannabes, and an acknowledgement that I would never be accepted by the publishing establishment and would always be an outsider; a wannabe. \nOnce the copies shipped to me, I quit my job and went out on the road selling Ichabod and my other books. Ichabod sold pretty well, but it wasn't burning up the sales chart. Still, it was slowly finding its audience. \nThen, in 2017, when we printed our seventh run of Ichabod Jones Monster Hunter, it exploded in popularity. Sales went off the charts. \nIt was so popular, in fact, that we ran out of our seventh printing faster than any run before it. I always thought Ichabod would fade from memory after the seventh printing, but something magical happened. \nWith each passing year, people loved Ichabod more and more. It wasn't fewer people that came up talking about the book...it was more people. More people came every convention, and begged me to keep going with the book. They demanded more issues...\n...but I always told them no. \nWhat changed?\nWe're currently working on the TV pitch for the show with an A list showrunner. Hammering out the details of the show gave me an epiphany about the comics. The same ideas that we were using to develop the TV show could be used to bring Ichabod back to life. \nWhich brings us here \nThat's why we're on Kickstarter; to see if the fans, you, really love Ichabod as much as you say you do. You've begged me thousands of times for more of his story, and here we are, ready to give it to you.\nI love Ichabod and am ready to keep making Ichabod issues for a long time. I have 24 issues tentatively sketched out, and it could go on for much longer. \nWhether we continue the book or not all depends on YOU. \nWe're here to see if there's enough interest in Ichabod to print an eighth edition of the first volume and fund the single issue printing of the fifth issue. The fifth issue is 100% complete, a 32-page thing of beauty. \nIf there is, then I'll keep making them as long as you keep buying them. If not, then Ichabod will fade back into the ether never to be heard from again. \nThe choice is up to you. Will Ichabod live...or die? \nThis is the exact kind of thing Kickstarter was made for, and I can't wait to bring Ichabod back to you if we fund. I think we have a ton of great pledges, but it all depends on you. \nIchabod's fate is in your hands. \nCan I get a look at the book? \nAbsolutely. At any time you can:\nCLICK HERE TO READ THE FIRST ISSUE OF ICHABOD JONES MONSTER HUNTER\nand/or...\nCLICK HERE TO GET A PREVIEW OF ISSUE #5\nI also recorded this little video to show you inside the first volume of Ichabod Jones. While the fifth issue is complete, it hasn't been printed yet, but even if I could show it to you, just about every page is a big juicy spoiler, so I wouldn't. \nPLAY\n\nBackers really love our books\nThere is no way I would be here without our fans and backers. I only have a career because of you, and I'm not being hyperbolic. Ichabod Jones started on Kickstarter, and with each Kickstarter I grow because of you. \nHere are just some of our super enthusiastic backers from our Monsters and Other Scary Shit campaign. \nWhere is the money going? \nA valid and important question. Here is how the money will be used: \nKickstarter - 10% - $1,566 \nProduction - 16% - $2,500    \nPrinting - 49% - $7,640    \nShipping - 16% $2,500   \nContingency - 9% - $1,460     \nTotal - $15,666\nLike I said in the video, it costs a lot to produce comic books. \nOther books\nOne of the pledge rewards is the ability to pick up one of our back catalog hardcovers. All our hardcovers run for $30 by themselves + $8 shipping, so you are getting the digital for Ichabod Jones Monster Hunter issue #5 plus the digital for volume one for free, basically. \nHere's a quick rundown of our other books. \nKatrina Hates Dead Shit -This is the first book drawn by Marvel artist Juan Frigeri, who mostly draws on the Spider-Man team and have worked on things like Renew your Vows among others. \nKatrina is about a woman who gets sick of living during the apocalypse so she sets out to kill the Devil, and along the way get embroiled in a battle between Heaven and Hell\nHere's a couple of interior pages. \nGet a preview of issue #1 by clicking right here.\nPixie Dust -Pixie Dust was drawn by Nicolas Touris and is meant to be read like an animated movie. It's been likened to Zelda with gore. \nPixie Dust is about a pixie monster hunter who sells her soul to the queen of the underworld and comes back from the dead to seek revenge on the king that murdered her. \nHere are a few of my favorite panels from Pixie Dust. \nGet a free preview of Pixie Dust by clicking right here. \nMonsters and Other Scary Shit - Monsters and Scary Shit is an anthology filled with more than 50 creators. It's cute stories, scary stories, funny stories and more all about monsters, and it's the cover that the nightmare elf is from,  drawn by Invader Zim artist Aaron Alexovich. \nHere are some images from that book (assuming the .gif loads. If not, just give it a minute).\nTo get a preview, click right here.\nCthulhu is Hard to Spell - This is our most popular book right now. It's the sequel to Monsters and Other Scary Shit, but this one focuses on the gods and monsters of H.P. Lovecraft. It's 35 stories about the gods and monsters of Lovecraft's universe from 70+ creators, including a cover by Aaron Alexovich. \nHere's a rundown of the styles. Just like above, give it a second to load. \nGet a preview of the book by clicking right here.  \nPlease be aware that the Cthulhu is Hard to Spell book is not available at the $38 level, but it is available in limited quantities at the $39 level, and it is included as an option of all $80+ pledge levels that qualify for multiple books. \nAny additional copies will be made available during the fulfillment phase.\nWhat about other add-ons? \n ***YOU CAN ADD $15 to get digital copies of issues 6-8 when they finish, months before they will be available to the public***\nBecause I use Backerkit, I handle all of my add-ons after the campaign. For instance, if you would like a second copy of the variant, then I will have those available after the campaign is over on our store. If you choose to do so now, then you can add $23 to your pledge for each variant and $13 for each standard issue. Shipping will be charged during the final fulfillment process. \nI'll also have my entire collection of ebooks available once the campaign ends. If you want to add the money now just so you don't forget, then each ebook is $6, or you can pledge at the $28 level to receive all my novels. \nI also have a digital collect of all my graphic novels available at the $29 level, and my entire digital library, including novels, graphic novels, and anthologies, available at the $60 level.\nI'll also have all of my pins. You can order the main pin, the nightmare elf, right now, but during the fulfillment stage you can order all the others. If you want to add some money now for it, each pin is $12 and shipping will be charged once you fill out your form. \nOr you can pledge $45 and get any four pins you would like from this set + the digital copies of issue #5 and the volume 1 trade.\nWhile most of this will be handled once the campaign ends, there are a couple of things that are available during the campaign that I would like to talk about now. The first is the pin designed by Aaron Alexovich. \nThis pin is straight from the cover of Monsters and Other Scary Shit, designed by Aaron, and the monster is straight from the pages of Ichabod #5. The nightmare elf comes upon you while you sleep, hypnotizes you and forces you to do it's bidding before killing you. It's very dark and creepy. \nThis is what it looks like on a bag. \nYou can get it at the $20, $30, $40 and up campaign levels, and ordering additional will be available once the campaign is over, or you can add $12 NOW to make sure you have it later, if you want. You won't be charged shipping for extras until after the campaign, though. \nAdditionally, you'll be able to order from our library of hardcover graphic novels, including Katrina Hates Dead Shit and Pixie Dust, as well as our anthologies, Monsters and Other Scary Shit and Cthulhu is Hard to Spell. \nPixie Dust and Katrina Hates Dead Shit are in a universe called the Godsverse, and there are multiple novels connecting them together, ranging from the time of Pixie Dust until 10,000 years after Katrina Hates Dead Shit. \nPixie Dust happens at a time when gods and monsters roam the world. Then, the gods abandon us, monsters are hunter to extinction, and they come back during Katrina Hates Dead Shit. \nAlso, we'll be offering our variant white eye addition of the Monster anthology, instead of the normal yellow eye edition. I only had a couple hundred of these white eye variant Soulless eye editions made, and they are almost gone! \nOur most popular book right now is Cthulhu is Hard to Spell, which is 35 stories about the gods and monsters of Lovecraft. There are funny stories, cute stories, scary stories, psychologically damaging stories, but they all deal with the gods and monsters themselves. This pairs very nicely with Ichabod Jones Monster Hunter, and they are our most popular combo. \nThe Crush it on Kickstarter course is my introductory course about how to run a Kickstarter campaign. It shows new creators (or ones who want to up their game), how to create, launch, fund, and distribute their campaigns. As a person who has run eight campaigns and successfully filled them all without going over budget, and having raised over $100,000 on Kickstarter, I know a thing or two about this stuff. \nMore importantly, I am a seasoned course creator through my website, The Complete Creative. If you would like to see the course, you can do so by clicking here. \nMy How to Make an Awesome Comics Anthology course is one I made specifically to help creators build better anthologies. \nAfter my first anthology campaign, people asked me a ton of questions about how to make a comics anthology, but I was too overwhelmed to answer them. Before my second anthology campaign, I wanted to be prepared, so I laid out my exact strategy for making an awesome comics anthology, and then went out and used the strategies I teach to raise $39,246 for Cthulhu is Hard to Spell. \nI'm very proud of this course and think that whether you are a seasoned pro at anthologies or just starting out, you can learn a ton from it. I take you all the way from finding your theme through running your Kickstarter campaign. \nPlus, if you buy this course you ALSO get my Crush it On Kickstarter course absolutely free. You can check out the course by clicking here. \nMy signature course is called Build a Rabid Fanbase. It's all about how to find your perfect fan, find out what they love, make money giving them exactly what they want, and then find thousands of other people like them. \nIt's pretty amazing, and if you back at the $500 level, you get all my courses, over $1,000 of my best stuff, for half price, plus you get everything at the special thanks level. You can check that out by clicking here. \nI also have a two hours consultation option, where I will help you build your creative career and move it to the next level, as I have done with numerous creatives around the world. If you get the consultation option, which is usually $600 by itself, I throw in all three of my courses for free, a $1000+ value. \nSneak preview of the book\nI don't want to spoil the fifth issue, so here are the first five pages of the first issue for you to check out. \nCLICK HERE TO READ THE FIRST ISSUE OF ICHABOD JONES MONSTER HUNTER\nand...\nCLICK HERE TO GET A PREVIEW OF ISSUE #5\nStill on the fence? That's okay. \nCLICK HERE TO READ THE FIRST ISSUE OF ICHABOD JONES MONSTER HUNTER\nand...\nCLICK HERE TO GET A PREVIEW OF ISSUE #5\nI hope you believe in this book and love it as much as I do. This is all for you, so I hope to be able to make Ichabod for many years to come. All we need is your help to make it happen. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI have delivered eight projects successful, and while they have all reached backer hands, each one has its own issues. I never start a campaign before I have the finished book through production, but even then there are potential issues with printing and shipping. \n\nI am conservative when I give my estimates and hope to beat them, but all I can promise is that I will keep you abreast every step of the way to make sure you are aware of the process. I try to work with the same vendors with every campaign so that I know their process, but even then there are unexpected delays that change things.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "PDF pack", "descp": "Get a pdf copy of Katrina Hates the Dead #1, Oxymoron #1 from Tyler James at Comixtribe, and Tart volume 1 from Kevin Joseph at Kechal Comics.\nINCLUDES:\nPDF pack", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2019"}], "stat": ["15 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "PDF + CBZ of Issue #5", "descp": "Get a PDF and CBZ copy of Ichabod Jones: Monster Hunter #5\nINCLUDES:\nDigital copy of issue #5\nPDF pack", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2019"}], "stat": ["38 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "PDF + CBZ of Ichabod Jones volume 1", "descp": "Receive a PDF + CBZ file of Ichabod Jones: Monster Hunter volume 1.\nINCLUDES:\nDigital copy of issue #5\nPDF pack\nDigital copy of volume 1", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2019"}], "stat": ["105 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 13 or more", "title": "Print copy of issue #5 - standard cover", "descp": "***DOMESTIC SHIPPING INCLUDED***\nGet a physical copy of the 32-page Ichabod Jones: Monster Hunter #5, the first new issue in 5 years!

In May 2019 we published Volume One thanks to the support of wonderful backers!  Now we're back with Volume Two, collecting the content releases from April through September of 2019 (6 releases in all).  Stretch goals fund additional art, allowing us to include additional content!  \nThis campaign funds a small soft cover press run and the fulfillment of backer rewards.  We are printing soft cover editions of this book through the same printer we used for our comic 47 Furious Tails, Issue One  and expect the same remarkable quality.  The Sinopa Omnibus is printed in 8.5 by 11 format.  Our press run will be done with a heavy  130 lb cover with a satin / soft touch finish and with durable 80 lb text pages. \nYou can see excerpts taken from the print file of Volume Two below.  We hope you will greatly enjoy this book and get great use from it in your games.  \nLilyandrea, the Spring Sorceress / Artist: Nick Caponi (excerpted from print file : pages 4 -5)\nWhat is in the book:\nThis volume contains six (6) entries.  Content includes a powerful sorceress ; a monster out of Japanese folklore; a legendary Greek sorceress; a tragic undead monster; a faerie queen straight out of Shakespearean tales (a new sorcerous blood is detailed here as well), and \"Major\" the hell hound raised by a fallen angel (the narrative describes the angel's fall and how \"Major\" came to be named.  Each entry contains its own story, stats, treasure information, story hooks and more.\nSir Morgan / Artist: Zack Viola (excerpted from print file : pages 22 - 23)\nBacker Rewards:\nPDF of the Book ~  Backers at all reward tiers receive PDF copy of the Sinopa Omnibus, Volume Two.  This is fulfilled through Drivethrurpg.com\nPrint on Demand Codes ~ Print on demand codes allow you to order a print copy of the book through Drivethrurpg.com and pay only the actual print cost from drivethrurpg (no mark-up) as well as the shipping costs specific to your address.  This campaign rewards backers with PoD codes for both soft and hard cover copies.\nPrint on demand Poster codes ~ These codes allow you to order 12 by 18 inch mini-posters through drivethrurpg.com of the following illustrations at a cost of $0.50 each (plus shipping):  \nGlenfallow Regional Maps (Players  & Game Master's Versions)  \nCirce, goddess and sorceress of legend\nJorogumo, spider demon woman of Japanese folklore\nTitania, Queen of Fairie and Arcadia\nOl' Jack, a legendary undead monster\nPlease note that Drivethrurpg folds these posters once for shipping.  {Yes, you can use these now.

This is one of my favorite things about KickStarter fulfillment. \nJorogumo, a monster from Japanese folklore / Artist: Anthony Ojeda (excerpted from print file : pages 10 - 11)\nCampaign Coffee Mug ~ Size 15 ounces / Please specify which of these you would like in your backer survey.

Due to the pricing for shipping to international destinations, I have appended the shipping costs to pledge levels.  It is an unfortunate reality that in this instance the shipping costs for international backers is higher than the book costs.  \nShirts and mugs ship directly from our supplier.\nSigned copies ship from the United States and are printed through Mixam. Each book is packed in a gemini mailer and packaged in a bubbled envelope for shipping.  Backers are responsible for any/all import duties/tariffs and taxes.

It is the position of Sinopa Publishing LLC and myself (W.S. Quinton) that labor has every right to organize without fear of reprisal.\n\nWhatever my support is worth, the workers and organizers at Kickstarter have it. If and when the employees at Kickstarter call for work to stop, I'll stop this campaign. So far, the union hasn't called for a boycott. If they do, the very moment they do, I'll end this campaign and launch it on another platform. \n\nIn the event of a strike I call on management and employees to keep cool heads on both sides of the picket line.

STRETCH GOAL FOR ALL BACKERS OF A PHYSICAL TIER  WILL BE UNLOCKED AT \u00a3700\nAbout me\nMy name is Patrick Brooks and I am a children's book illustrator and writer with 17 books published and am represented by Advocate Art. www.psbrooks.com \n What's the story? \nGoose and Moose live across from one another on two sides of a cliff. They compete in absolutely everything, from riding bikes, to eating the most sweets - always wanting to outdo the other. Their rivalry and fighting escalates until it gets way of out of control. Goose can't fly and Moose can't swim, which affects their confidence and makes them outsiders at school. Not even Mother Goose can calm them down.\n Why did I write this book?\nI felt like it was important to create a children's book about the rivalry and conflict children might have with one another. It was also to explore themes such as problem solving, not fitting in, mindfulness and emotional well-being, but done in a way that was fun, educational and easily accessible. I hope it will help children through many everyday situations in and outside of school when interacting with those around them, and will benefit parents, teachers and others too. \n Rewards

London is gripped by madness, dominated by cosmetic surgeons, lifestyle coaches, and pill-pushers.

Due to this, he has enemies both legal and criminal. As he runs for his life, he must put his business empire aside and find out what it means to live, love, and be loved in return. Throughout this chaos, Justin finds that his only chance at redemption may just be a young punk named Luna.\nCoronary Volume 1 cover.\nClick here to help us reach our goal by sharing on Twitter!\n Here are a few samples from the story so far.

The story as a whole is told out of sequence and from many different perspectives. Our books are a comic book adaptation of this novel.\nIn 2017, we successfully Kickstarted The Ronin #1. If you were not part of that campaign I encourage you to go check it out here. Now, we are raising the necessary funds for color and printing to help expedite the creation and release of The Ronin #2. \n  **CLICK HERE FOR A 10-PAGE PREVIEW OF THE RONIN #2** \nIn Issue One, we met The Ronin and followed him as he terrorized a small town. The Ronin seems to destroy every town and village he visits with little resistance and seemingly zero consequences. \nAs the story progresses, we will meet the people whose lives the Ronin has impacted, with a focus on one character in particular. One victim, a child made an orphan by The Ronin, vows revenge. We explore his story alongside the Ronin's as they each grow and change over the years. Their two paths collide, ultimately culminating in a final, unexpected conclusion. \nIn Issue Two, we meet a character known as The Old Swordmaster who is a key figure in The Ronin #2 and throughout the rest of the story. He is a retired samurai turned instructor, but he hasn't had a student in years. \nWe also meet \"The Three\". These are three young boys who want nothing more in life than to become samurai. They frequently petition the Old Swordmaster to train them. \nAfter a lifetime of military service and battle, The Old Master wants nothing to do with \u201cthe sword\u201d and he initially declines their requests. However, soon something changes his mind and their samurai training begins.\nThroughout the pages of this issue, we see the three young samurai's growth, development, and training as they pursue their ultimate goal. These characters are on a collision course with The Ronin, and in book three, we will see how they are all connected. It\u2019s thrilling, and you\u2019re gonna love it!\nThis is chapter two of a multi-chapter project. The plan is to release each completed chapter on its own and to collect all 8-10 chapters into a final graphic novel. It is a huge project that will take a lot of time. This campaign is to help put us in a position to produce these chapters, and we thank you for your support. \nWHY NOW?\nWith the success of The Ronin #1, everyone wanted to know when Issue Two is coming out. The Ronin #1 was completed with funds out of my pocket. Needless to say, it took a long time to finance and produce. If I were to approach Book Two the same way it would be a long time before it saw the light of day. By Kickstarting The Ronin #2 now we will be able to complete it a lot sooner. \nWHERE DOES THE MONEY GO?\nEverything we raise will go exclusively toward producing, printing, and shipping the work. The funds will be divided primarily between the artists and printing costs. Of course, Kickstarter will take their fees, then there are reward costs and shipping, but this campaign is mainly to complete and print The Ronin #2 in a timely manner. \nAny money raised above and beyond our needs will go toward chapter three, which is projected for release in early 2020.\nWRITER\nMy name is Chris Dickens. I am a comic book writer and creator known for my indie series \"Vigilante Project\", and now for \"The Ronin\". I discovered The Ronin when world-famous actor Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa and I were discussing villains in comics and film. He expressed a concern that bad guys today are too one-dimensional and I agreed. \nAt the end of our conversation, Mr. Tagawa recommended that I read a novel called The Ronin to experience the ultimate bad guy. So I ordered the book and couldn't put it down! I read the whole thing in a matter of hours. \nCary-Hiroyuki Tagawa after The Ronin #1 Success!\nThe Ronin character is the ultimate bad guy and his story was like nothing I'd ever read. I looked for a film or comic book based on this story but couldn\u2019t find anything, so I decided to make it myself. \n\nPENCILS AND INKS\nGIAN CARLO BERNAL \nThe artist for The Ronin #1 was Gian Carlo Bernal. On the heels of The Ronin, Gian Carlo's services were requested by a variety of publishers and he was unable to complete Book Two. However, Gian Carlo did complete the first 10 pages. \nEder Messias\nPicking up where Gian Carlo left off, is Eder Messias, an amazing artist from Brazil! Eder's pencils and inks are so dynamic, I knew that he had to be our artist. Eder has done a lot of work and his services are in high demand. We are lucky to have him on board. \nPencils and Inks by Eder Messias\nCOLORS\nFor colors, Jeremy Shepherd continues to shine after doing amazing work on book one. Jeremy  has done work for Image and DC Comics in the past and I am lucky to have him on this project. However, he is very busy so we weren't able to get him back for book two, but Jeremy contributed colors for the book three cover and the sample page below. We hope to have him back soon. \nColors by Jeremy Shepherd\nOmi Remalante\nTaking over for Jeremy is Omi Remalante! Omi has done work for Aspen Comics, Image, Dynamite and many more. However, I am most fond of the work he did for our Vigilante Project graphic novel cover. Check it out below. \nColors by Omi Remalante\n\nLETTERS AND DESIGN\nLetters are provided by Sean Glumace. Sean is an experienced graphics and letters person with a number of credits to his name. Sean is an Adobe Certified Associate, and he has lettered books for Image, Dark Horse, and more. \nThe Ronin #2 Cover by Eder Messias!\n\n\nWe are estimating an October shipping date for ALL rewards and ALL domestic orders INCLUDE shipping!

I have a Masters in Creative Writing for Film & TV and have been working in comics for over ten years. Among this work, I created Cabra Cini: Voodoo Junkie Hitwoman, a character who had a strip annually in the Halloween issue of H!M Comics' IF-X anthology, and will be coming into the Geek-Girl ongoing series in the future. I have self-published two The Almighties one-shots (a comedy super-team co-created with Mike Gagnon); released a 4-issue Geek-Girl Mini-Series through publisher Markosia monthly from Nov 2016, ran a successful Kickstarter for its TPB, and then for the first four issues of the ongoing series, which are now collected for this Kickstarter in the Crime War TPB.\n\"My favorite comic and biggest influence is Grant Morrison's bizarre run on Doom Patrol, which has helped inspire a number of weird and wonderful creations that, now we're ongoing, I am going to be bringing to the pages of Geek-Girl. Weirdness such as The Hall of Diamonds, the Rat Fink and Groovejet: The Living Party are all in GG's future, as well as the aforementioned Cabra Cini.\"\n Colombian Carlos Granda is Geek-Girl's artist. His previous work includes Grimm Fairy tales, The Jungle Book, Heroes of Home Room C (which was successfully funded on Kickstarter) and Pirouette. Besides handling his own workload, Carlos is co-director of The National Comic & Manga Hall and FICCO - groups dedicated to  nurturing and exhibiting the artwork of local creators in Medellin www.artstation.com/grandacomicfan \nGeek-Girl Colorist Chunlin Zhao lives in Sichuan, China. She has been coloring and illustrating comics since 2012, working on such comics as Wretches, The Misadventures of Electrolyte, and Shogun Knight Dyson V - for publishers including Oddworld, Jackalope and Outland Entertainment.  \nGeek-Girl's letterer Paul McLaren started off drawing comics as a kid, with his school friend and fellow Scotsman Mark Millar (Kick-Ass, Kingsman, Secret Service)  - though went on to have a career in the police. He left the Police  Service to work in the Middle East as an Explosive Detection Dog Handler  in the private security industry but then (as you do) got back into the  comic scene in 2008, when he lettered a small 6 page project called  \"Camouflage\" written by Martin Conaghan (Fallen Heroes), later lettering Martin's Graphic Novel Burke and Hare. \nHe  now works on a number of projects for various publishers, and his most recent have been comics for the Unseen Shadows Universe,(www.unseenshadows.net) and a Graphic Novel about the life of  Aleister Crowley. \nGeek-Girl #5's cover is by Sun Khamunaki, a comic cover artist & illustrator from Victoria BC Canada known for her fine art inspired style.

We're back to bring you the next installment in the 'sitcomic' adventures of Morgan and the crazy organauts living inside his body. Are you ready to see what might really be going on inside our insides?\nIn 2016, we introduced Kickstarter and the world to Book 1 of our quirky concept, and in 2017, we returned with Book 2. Thanks to the love and support of our incredible fans, we're able to return for Book 3 of Morgan's Organs. The great thing about this series is each story is standalone - you can read it in any order and still enjoy the heck out of it!\nIn Book 1 (click to preview), we witnessed Morgan's two \"heads\" of the body clash for control of Morgan's decision-making, all while Morgan battled the pressure to end a dry spell.\nIn Book 2 (click to preview), we cringed as Morgan dealt with the pains of swallowing something he shouldn't, and the consequences it would have for the organauts as it moved through his digestive system.\nThis time, we're bringing you a story riddled with alcohol, phallic artwork and a secret Morgan wish he never knew. And what I am most excited about is that we're using an unconventional narrative style for this book with a structure similar to that of Christopher Nolan's hit movie, Memento.\nTake a look at the Book 3 preview pages below!\n Dick drawings, black eyes and amnesia, oh my!\nMorgan's Organs is the brain spawn of me - Daniel Brodie. After a couple years of pursuing the idea as a television series, I realized that the best way to bring my idea to the world would be to make it happen myself. So I partnered with the incredibly talented artist, Robert Jennex, to create the world of Morgan's Organs. Rob brings an incredible vision and spark to the series, and none of this would be possible without my Canadian partner-in-crime.\nWe're also excited to continue to have Tyler Kelting from Oklahoma, USA, on our team as the series colourist. Tyler joined us for Book 2 to handle the full colours, and he has brought an incredible sense of discipline and creativity to build on the Morgan's Organs style.\n(From left to right): Daniel, Rob, Tyler\nThis series focuses on Morgan as he navigates everyday college life, which is made difficult by the fact that he isn't completely \"human\". Inside his body lives a variety of organ-like characters (called organauts) who control his various body systems and ultimately, are keeping him alive. The problem is these organauts don't always operate with the best interests of their host in mind.   \nThe stories take place on two levels. Outside, we follow Morgan and his group of friends as they navigate college life. Zoom in to his insides and we see how Morgan's struggles are made worse by a group of organauts who bicker, lie, cheat, argue, act selfish, and generally, don't work together as one.\nStretch Goals Unlocked!\n\nClick to learn more about this stretch goal\nClick to learn more about this stretch goal\nMake sure to read the below highlights about our rewards. \nBelow is a summary of the various reward tiers. Most rewards tiers build on their previous tier.\nAll of the below tiers include physical rewards. Shipping is incremental to the dollar amount indicated.\nI have always tried to be transparent about the budget for my Kickstarter's and what the funds will be used for. I don't see this as a business - not yet, at least. These campaigns are part of my long-term vision to have Morgan's Organs picked up by a publisher, and eventually made as a television series. All of my rewards are priced appropriately to cover exactly what I need to support this vision. That means covering artist salary, production (including printing), and packaging/shipping. \nI pay my artist team what I am able, but we have a mutual understanding this is a partnership and we're investing in a long-term vision. Between Book 1 and Book 2, I was able to increase my per-page-rate for the art team. I hope to be able to do so again for this campaign by exceeding our campaign goal.\nOur Kickstarter goal of $4,000 CAD supports the below:\n60% = artist salary\n30% = the 4P's - printing / production / packaging / parceling (shipping)\n10% = Kickstarter fees\nEverything raised above this goal will go to a combination of:\nAdditional printing (further driving down per-unit-cost and creating opportunity to invest in our stretch goal rewards)\nIncreasing artist salary\nConvention booths at future events\nFuture stories in the series!\nBook 3 is already more than 75% complete - we only have about 10 pages left to ink and 20 pages to colour. Our goal is to deliver all campaign rewards by end-July/early-August.\nRead some of the past coverage we've received on Book 1 and Book 2 of the series!\nStarburst - Book 1: 8/10 stars - \"Smutty, slapstick yet spectacularly striking in its approach and relatability, this is a battle of the heads that\u2019s an absolute riot to watch unravel.\"\nStarburst- Book 2: 8/10 stars - \"Even more charming and funny than its predecessor... a hell of a fun ride.\"\nComic Crusaders -\"Daniel lays out a wonderful story that I, no WE, need to read more of! The art is great, Robert brings to life the world of Morgan\u2019s organs with a clean, animated style.\"\nComixBrew - \"Morgan\u2019s Organs is the kind of comic that is good to show your buddies for the laughs but also contains a deceptive amount of depth.\"\nComic Unknown - \"If you ever wondered how Inside Out would have worked through the eyes of a male college student, look no more. Morgan's Organs is a gut-busting comedy that while the idea has been seen before, it is the fresh take we need and want.\"\nBleeding Cool - \"Morgan\u2019s Organs #2 hits a rhythm that the first issue only brushed up against. With this issue, each character has its place, and the situation is so ludicrous that it really lines up with the surreal premise of the comic.\"\nThe Outhousers - \"The delightfully cartoonish art and exploration of maturity help [Morgan's Organs] defy expectations. It's a satisfying read for those that love thoughtful comedy.\"\nIf you've gotten this far, might as well read the rest of it! I'm honestly humbled that Morgan's Organs is even a thing in this world. I remember six years ago, I was embarrassed to even spill my idea to friends. Now, I am on my feet at Conventions, shouting at people walking by my booth to check out a comic that features a talking penis.\nThe reception to the series on Kickstarter, online, and at events has been incredible. I am not in this industry to make comics - I'm here to make Morgan's Organs! With each book, I get closer to my goal of getting picked up by a publisher so that I am able to make books more frequently, and who knows, maybe one day I can go back to my original dream of making this into a television series.\nOnly more books and more time will tell what the future of Morgan's Organs holds... oh, and your support for the series!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRisks, schmisks! We've done this twice before already and know exactly how to execute a Kickstarter campaign. In our previous two campaigns, we delivered within one to two months of the original promised date, with delays simply because we wouldn't sacrifice time for quality! This campaign, we have even more of Book 3 complete than ever before to ensure we can deliver that much sooner.\n\nShort of Rob and Tyler getting enlisted to be the first humans to land on Mars, there is nothing stopping this project from happening. And even if they do end up on Mars, I'm sure there will be decent Wi-Fi connection for them to keep working between their less important, interstellar missions.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge CA$ 1 or more", "title": "Atom", "descp": "Every dollar helps!\nThe description in the below tiers indicates the feature reward available.

At this time Drip is scheduled to be transitioned to a new platform model, with new features.  When this happens, later this year, the folks at KickStarter/Drip have announced that they would help existing Drip creators with the transition and/or help them migrate to a new platform if they wished to.  If the new platform is not to my liking, I will be migrating to Patreon.\nI hope to grow the subscriber community on my Drip page and eventually begin releasing even more content with each monthly publication.  Current subscribers to my Drip page received the digital (PDF) file already.  You can find my Drip page HERE:\n\nDigital rewards are fulfilled through Drivethrurpg.com / Physical copies are printed through Drivethru/lightning source unless we reach press run stretch goal.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe book is complete with the original content and is undergoing final edits as we launch.\nArt is formatted.\nWriting for stretch goal content is outlined and will be complete by end of May. \n \nStretch goal art is being distributed between very talented artists who have always displayed the finest attention to deadlines. I expect no delay from art.\n\nI have the utmost confidence that this project will fulfill on schedule but I also have considerable experience in resolving problems that are common to KickStarter campaign fulfillment. That said, the following are the most likely risks associated with this campaign:\n\n1) Printing delays (signed copy backers) ~ printing problems can happen and when it does it slows down fulfillment of printed copies. Any such problems will be disclosed as they are encountered and projections updated for fulfillment. I have a primary printer, a secondary and yes, even a third option if needed. When we fund you can be assured we'll be shipping those printed books out to signature backers!\n\n2) Delivery problems (signed copy backers) ~ Lost or stolen packages can severely impact deliver times. I will be announcing when packages are shipped so you can be aware of when these book went out. If after two weeks you haven't received your copy, please contact me directly.\n\n3) Flaws with digital delivery. This is usually the result of typographical errors where an email address was incorrectly input. Best way to prevent this is to check your answers to the backer survey before submission. If something changes with your information, please contact me directly so I can update it on my end for fulfillment.\n\nI've made every effort to make certain this campaign runs as smoothly as possible. We have a limited number of stretch goals set and unless we fund well beyond the current top stretch goal we'll sticking to that amount of content in order to adhere to our fulfillment

From this point on, everything will go to producing our next story. \n***\nA BIG THANK YOU to Scott Baker (4scottbaker@gmail.com) for making this video.\nBOSTON METAPHYSICAL SOCIETY needs your help to print our new standalone book, THE SPIRIT OF REBELLION (A Caitlin O\u2019Sullivan Story). It is a 34 page story in a 44 page perfect bound book, which means 10 pages of extras!\nHere's our cover!\nWho will love Boston Metaphysical Society?\nFans of Penny Dreadful, Girl Genius, Ruse, steampunk and gaslamp fantasy stories.\nPeople who like to read paranormal, historical fiction, and/or alternate history.\nIf you like character-driven comics with a mix of paranormal and science fiction, then these are the comics for you!\nTHE STORY\nEven after saving Boston from The Shifter, Caitlin is thrown out by her mother for working with Samuel and Granville. When she goes to Samuel for help, he takes her to the boarding house of an old friend in Philadelphia. There she discovers a ghost, the beginning of a rebellion, and perhaps her destiny.\nLike Boston, the poor and working class of Philadelphia are pushing back against the Great Houses, and Caitlin and Samuel are caught in the middle of it. And much to her surprise, Caitlin has discovered that the battle with The Shifter has left her with telekinetic powers. What no one realizes is that a Pinkerton by the name of Harry Connelly has taken a special interest in Caitlin and the boarding house. Is he friend or foe? And what does this mean for Samuel and Caitlin?\nTHE SPIRIT OF REBELLION is a standalone continuation of the original six issue mini-series. \nFirst three pages:\nNEW TO BOSTON METAPHYSICAL SOCIETY?\nIf you are new to the series, the original six issue mini-series is about an ex-Pinkerton detective, a spirit photographer, and a genius scientist who battle supernatural forces in late 1800\u2019s Boston. They live in an alternate steampunk history where ghosts and demons are a normal part of life. Families known as the Great Houses control the economy of the Great States of America while the middle class and lower classes sole purpose are to serve the Great Houses.\nThe original trade paperback is available in several reward tiers.\nCOVER ART BY EMILY HU. COLOR AND INKING BY GLORIA CAELI.\nWHAT'S IN THE TRADE? \nI'm glad you asked. Not only does it include all six issues from the mini-series as well as the cover art, but it also contains a ten page short story called, Hunter-Killer, and additional bonus pages. With art by Emily Hu and coloring by Gloria Caeli, the story is set at the beginning of the House Wars (my version of the American Civil War) and features the crew of a prototype airship. I introduce three new characters: Gwen Warrick - Captain; Emmet Rochester - Navigator; and Joaquin Medina - Engineer. \nAnd for what the story is about, well I have two words for you - Airship Battle!\nThe complete story of Hunter-Killer will ONLY be available in the trade.\nTHE SCOURGE OF THE MECHANICAL MEN (A Granville Woods and Nikola Tesla Story)\nThis was our first standalone continuation of the series and it is available as well. \nSTORY: Granville and Tesla are in a race for time to save Boston from a mysterious disease that turns human beings into machines. \nTHE MONEY:\nWhere the money goes...Your backing would enable us to pay for a print run of the book which means printing enough copies to send off to backers with some leftover to sell at conventions, incentives, shipping (which includes mailing envelopes, postage and handling.) And, of course, the fees (5% off the top, plus credit card fees.)\nTHE TEAM FOR THE SPIRIT OF REBELLION and THE SCOURGE OF THE MECHANICAL MEN:\nMadeleine Holly-Rosing - Writer/Creator: A TV, feature film, comic book writer, and novelist, Madeleine holds an MFA in Screenwriting from UCLA where she won numerous awards as well as the Sloan Fellowship.

Not only does it bring my love of science fiction and history together, (which by the way, equals steampunk), the steampunk time period allows me to address the themes of classism, sexism, and racism in America in a thoughtful and engaging way. For at its very core, BOSTON METAPHYSICAL SOCIETY is an American story. And you can't tell an American story without including women and people of color.\nIt has been and always will be important to me to write characters who, though they come from diverse backgrounds and have different points of view, are able to work together for the common good.\nOTHER REWARDS\nIn addition to THE SPIRIT OF REBELLION, we are offering the trade paperback which includes a brand new ten page story, a BRAND NEW bookmark, the anthology Boston Metaphysical Society: Prelude, and the first novel set in this universe, BOSTON METAPHYSICAL SOCIETY: A STORM OF SECRETS, plus a NEW TEAPOT LAPEL PIN.

Pin set will include all five different pins.)\nBOSTON METAPHYSICAL SOCIETY: A STORM OF SECRETS\nThe award winning novel, BOSTON METAPHYSICAL SOCIETY: A STORM OF SECRETS, is a prequel to the original graphic novel though it can be read as a standalone. It takes place five years prior to the original series.\nIt was recently awarded a Silver Medal as well as The Write Companion Award for Best Overall TOP PICK - Adult, Children's and Young Adult categories in the Feathered Quill Book Awards. \nStory: As the Great Houses of Boston jockey for power, an ex-Pinkerton detective, his psychic wife, and his father-in-law must contend with treachery, subterfuge, and a new demonic threat, in this political and supernatural thriller set in an alternate-history Boston of 1890.\nThe award winning cover is by Luisa Preissler. Title Graphics by Anke Koopman.\nAnd if you haven't read Boston Metaphysical Society: Prelude yet, then this would be the perfect time to get it. This anthology of short stories and novellas includes stories of how Granville and Samuel met and their first case together; what set Caitlin on her path; and how Samuel met his wife, Elizabeth Weldsmore Hunter.

Tom leads on the art and Nimue on the stories but we both do  both.   Hopeless, Maine, is an island off the coast of Maine and has been our occasional home for some years now.

Thank you Tom and Nimue!\nSTRETCH GOAL #2 - $5,600 - REACHED!!\nDIGITAL COMIC BUNDLE #1\nOver the years, I\u2019ve run across a number of comics, both online and at Cons, I\u2019ve enjoyed.

He has to reconcile the regimented existence he's worked his whole life to perfect versus the outrageous one he's unintentionally created for many others and himself.

To protect what was left of their culture, the Sunmakers sealed themselves away from the doomed world. Now their numbers have dwindled, and Tibhan, the last of the Sunmakers, must risk everything by returning to the desolate wastes to fuel the fire that preserves his people's essence.\nEven if the cost is great and unthinkable.\nThis is the second chapter of a three issue mini-series. \nSunmaker is for those who like their fantasy dark, with thematic undertones, and who want some color in their apocalypse!  \nA fantasy story that takes place in a vivid apocalyptic world.\nStrong theme of legacy and what happens when your values come into conflict with morality.\nThe struggle of understanding that for something to thrive, something else may have to be sacrificed.\n22 pages of full-color sequentials plus 6 pages of extras which include a pinup gallery. That's a whole 28 pages total!\n6.625 x 10.25 on 85b gloss paper with a 105lb gloss cover, just like issue #1!\nOff-set printed for the highest quality.\nA limited variant cover by John Edingfield II. \nFree digital issue #1 standard version with every pledge\nAnd, you know, a glove that shoots fire...\nTibhan and his father are the last remaining Sunmakers. Their legacy, the great fire of the Second Sun, must be preserved by any means.\nWith the fire of the Second Sun nearly extinguished, Tibhan must leave the safety of the vault and find more energy to fuel it. During his travels of the frozen wastes he runs into opposition; a race of ice people known as Sunbloods.\nDid I mention those Sunbloods are hostile? Very hostile? \nLucky for Tibhan, his Combustion Glove makes him no pushover.\nHowever, with their greater numbers, Tibhan is over-come... sweet flame thrower glove or not.\nTibhan awakes to find himself saved by Meirin, another Sunmaker!\nTo save her own people, Meirin agrees to travel along with Tibhan to the Sunbloods tower and retrieve the source of the Second Sun.\nAnd just when it seemed like it was going to be easy... well, let's not spoil that.\nHow far will Tibhan go to preserve the legacy of his people? We find out in issue #2!\n\u201cWhen are you going to stop talking about making a comic and actually make a comic?!\u201d\nNot exactly the words you want to hear from your significant other, but for me they rang true and struck deep. They pushed me to take action.\nAnd then? \nNot having the first clue about what exactly making a comic entailed, I stumbled upon a website called ComixTribe which, for the first time, broke down all the steps. Included on the ComixTribe website was a column called The Proving Grounds, a weekly public script edit by two professional comic editors.\nThis is where I found the script for Sunmaker. There was something that captivated me about the world and the characters. Especially the line \"All things return to the cold!\"\n  After the first time I read the script I'd feed my cats and I'd be shouting \"All things return to the cold!\" at them (which was met with \"just freakin' feed me already\" stares). \nDamn cats.\nI had to tell Liam how much I loved the script, which ended up kicking off Sunmaker  coming to life. My hope is to capture as much energy and excitement  that I felt the when I initially read the story and bring that to  each page. \nBut the reason I reached out to Liam beyond all the other submissions to TPG is how he kept coming back to TPG. He submitted more than anyone else. His desire to grow and learn made him someone that I would love to work with.\n  Because of that, I've grown as a storyteller.\nI think Liam is a fantastic writer, and if this project means a book Liam has that he can give to people to see his skills and use it to get more work in the future, that would mean more to me than anything for this series.\nStories are meant to be shared.\n \"I wanted to write Sunmaker to tell a story about tradition and the lengths people are willing to go to preserve it. \nFantasy works best, in my view, when it examines a particular facet of the human condition (albeit through the lens of magical fires and ice-people) and there's something inside all of us that speaks to the need to preserve; it's a basic human instinct. \nIn that way, we are all Sunmakers looking to keep our respective fires aflame. But as is the nature of reality, all things return to the cold, and clinging our dying legacies pulls us further from the warmth and the light. \nLetting go is then what keeps us human, and that's really what I wanted to convey with Sunmaker.\" \n\"It feels like a video game when you're reading it.\"\n          -Kat Calamia, Comic Frontline \n\"Sunmaker has an art style that will melt your heart and a story that will freeze it back together!\"\n          -Chris Orndoff, Headmetal Press\n\" Sunmaker is a fantastical romp through a frozen hell of snow and ice monsters that only the bonds of friendship and family can keep at bay and ultimately overcome. All things return to the cold, but some things are greater than the cold.\" \n          -Will Allred, writer of Diary of Night\n\"A dying sun, a tormented warrior, and a glove that shoots fire! Sunmaker carries you into heated battles, tortured pasts and mournful music, before returning you longingly - where all things belong - to the cold...\"\n          -Andy Perry, writer of Undetermined\nIndeed. And a giant one, at that.\nCheck out the first few pages of issue two that picks up where the battle left off!\nThe book is 100% complete! The only thing left to do is print, and that is why we are coming to Kickstarter.\nWe are looking to fund an offset print run of 1,500 books through KrakenPrint that Liam and I will split for product to sell at conventions and other channels.\n Most of the funds raised in the campaign will go towards printing costs.  Kickstarter and Stripe take a small fee off the top of the campaign,  with the rest of the money raised going to cover shipping.   \nOh, we're bringing the BOOM to a whole other level.\nIf this hasn't been enough and you still want to see more, then how does an 10 page full-color preview sound? \nBy signing up to to my email list, you'll receive it right now, and I'll even throw in the full issue #1 if you're new to the series and want to be sure this is for you!\nShow me more!\nJohn Edingfield II, creator of Rancidville, contributed this AMAZING variant cover for Sunmaker #2! \nFor you collectors out there, this is limited to 150 copies!\nOh, yea, did I mentioned it would be signed by John? How cool is that?!\nIf you want a print copy of Sunmaker Chapter #1 and it's not included in your pledge, don't worry!\nAll you have to do is click \"Manage your Pledge\", then \"Change my pledge.\" Add $6 to any print level reward and you're set!\nI love comics. The larger majority of books I get are from creators  themselves, so I appreciate when someone takes that little something extra to be sure that my package gets there in excellent shape.\nHere is a look at the packaging mock-ups you can expect to receive your reward in.\nFor tiers that include the physical book, sketch-in, and aluminum prints this is what your shipment will look like. All comics are bagged and boarded, then packed inside a rigid cardboard envelope.\nOriginal art mock-up packaging looks like this:\nThe comic is still protected inside of a bag with a board. Aluminum prints have their own bag to protect them from being scratched. The original art will be placed inside a rigid plastic protector, then inserted into a priority mail box to make the package even more rigid.  Finally, that box will be placed into a large bubble mailer to protect your reward even further.\nBut the real secret?\nNinjas.\nThat's right. Your own personal package protector. These guys will keep your shipment safe, as no one wants to mess with a ninja.\nNo one.\nWhile I've done my best to attempt to select shipping materials that will best keep your product safe, I'm aware that things do happen.\nIf for any reason you receive a package at fulfillment with a book that doesn't meet your quality standards I will replace it at absolutely no cost to you.\nI know there are collectors out there, and I want your book to make it to you in excellent condition.\nIf you've played video games, you know collectibles are a big part of the experience.\nSince Sunmaker has huge influences from gaming, I thought it would be cool to take that part of the gaming world and bring it to this project. \nThe only way Sunmaker is possible is because of your support, and I'm ever grateful for that.\nAnd as a Kickstarter supporter, I feel that you should have something unique, only available through the campaign. \nWhenever you support the book through a physical tier (because of shipping) you will receive a Sunshard for that corresponding issue. These Sunshards can be collected together to form an image that will be used to attach to a future bookplate.\nNo one from a convention will get these pieces. \nNo one from an online store.\nOnly the people who help make this project a reality.\nJust a little something to make it extra cool and as a thank you.\nThis is not the final art, but it should give you an idea of what to expect!\nThe campaign will run throughout January and Febuary. Since KrakenPrint does all their offset printing overseas, there is approximately a two month wait for books to arrive. Books are expected about the middle of May, and will ship immediately upon arrival.\nBackers should expect to receive their rewards by July.\nA big, blue caption box can't express nearly how grateful I am for allowing me to share my project with you. Thank you for your time and attention.\nI'd like to ask for your support in bringing Sunmaker to life. Please back this campaign today and join us for the fun we have in store for our backers!\nWith gratitude,\nRyan", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI understand what it means to ask for your support.\n\nThis will be my second Kickstarter campaign, so I know (more-or-less) what to expect. \n\nBut let's be realistic, there are always surprises\n\nI'm very familiar with Kickstarter platform having backed over 200 campaigns.

But she doesn't want him, or anyone.\nJustin must put his business aside and concentrate on what it means to live, love, and be loved in return. He created an unattainable standard for women that drove them to buy his miracle pills and pushed them into the arms of his surgeons.

We're looking to raise $3500 -- here's how it breaks down:\n$1500 for the creative team\n$1200 for the 10,000 copy print run\n$300 shipping\n$300 for Kickstarter fees\n$200 for reward creation\nThis is the minimum we would need to produce the comic and get it to backers and retailers as well as get funds to the creative team for their hard work on the issue.\n11x17 mini-poster\nWait -- $1200 for a 10,000 copy print run??\nYes! Alterna Comics prints all of its single issues on newsprint -- this enables us to keep costs very low! We also sell advertising space in our issues, which again, helps keep print costs down. So that's why a 10,000 copy print run will cost as low as $1200. We'll be combining this print run with our normal print runs as well, which is part of what helps to provide a lower unit cost too. Our average print runs are between 4000 to 7000 copies (as we print copies for distribution to comic shops and newsstands).\n  Carry some comics around with this 13x15 tote bag!\n  Show your Alterna Comics pride in this shirt!\n  Keep your noggin warm with this Alterna Comics beanie!\nSo what's AMAZING AGE about?\nThis series focuses on three childhood friends that are no longer friends by the time high school rolls around.  But when they get sucked into the comic book world they all created as kids, their friendship is reignited as they must focus on finding a way to save the day and make it back home in one piece. The complete 5 issue mini-series is currently available in comic shops across the world and was one of our top 10 best-selling titles in 2017.  It's also available for purchase on this Kickstarter (or you can get the upcoming graphic novel compilation which is also available on this Kickstarter!).\n#0 features the untold origin of the Amazing Age universe.\nMatthew David Smith (writer/co-creator) Matthew's past works include the graphic novel BEE STING (with artist Jeremy Massie) which he later turned into a film that also spawned a sequel: BEE STING 2: Bear Sting.\nJeremy Massie (penciler/co-creator) Jeremy's past works include ALL MY GHOSTS, THE DEADBEAT, and BEE STING.  Jeremy is the sole creator, writer, and artist on ALL MY GHOSTS and THE DEADBEAT.\nChristine Brunson (colorist) Christine has been involved with several other comics including UNDEAD NORM and AMAZONIA.\nThe graphic novel cover to AMAZING AGE.\n FIVE PAGE PREVIEW of AMAZING AGE #0\n         ALTERNA COMICS Gallery\n         ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe only risk here are ones that are out of our control (natural disasters, shipping delays due to weather, etc.) -- we've got everything else under control!

REACHED!\nA BIG THANK YOU to Scott Baker (4scottbaker@gmail.com) for making this video.  Music by Emmett Cooke.\nBOSTON METAPHYSICAL SOCIETY needs your help to print our new book, THE SCOURGE OF THE MECHANICAL MEN (A Granville Woods and Nikola Tesla story). It is a 34 page story in a 44 page perfect bound book, which means 10 pages of extras!\nIf you are new to the series, the original six issue mini-series is about an ex-Pinkerton detective, a spirit photographer, and a genius scientist who battle supernatural forces in late 1800\u2019s Boston. They live in an alternate steampunk history where ghosts and demons are a normal part of life. Families known as the Great Houses control the economy of the Great States of America while the middle class and lower classes sole purpose are to serve the Great Houses.\nTHE SCOURGE OF THE MECHANICAL MEN is a standalone continuation of the series written by Madeleine Holly-Rosing. Art, inking, and color are by Gwynn Tavares.\nTHE STORY\nGranville and Tesla are in a race for time to save Boston from a mysterious disease that turns human beings into machines.\nGranville returns home to Liberty Row only to find an almost insane Tesla hiding there. But his efforts to get rid of Tesla hit a snag when they discover that a virus is turning humans into soulless mechanical men. Realizing that Emily and Travis Morgan of Morgan Medicinals are behind the outbreak, they fear that the twins are after more than just control of Boston \u2013 They want to take over the Great States of America.\nEMILY AND TRAVIS MORGAN\nEmily, a brilliant scientist, has spent her life creating cures for other people and seeing none of the financial rewards or acknowledgement. Her brother Travis handles the business side of the company and resents that neither he nor his sister has ever been given their due.\nCan Granville and Tesla work together to save the city? Or will Boston and the Great States of America fall under the control of THE SCOURGE OF THE MECHANICAL MEN?\nCover art, inking, and color by Gwynn Tavares.\nThe entire story is off to our letterer, Troy Peteri, so here are the first three colored pages for you to see the amazing job that Gwynn has done.\n      NEW TO BOSTON METAPHYSICAL SOCIETY?\nNo worries. The original trade paperback is available in several reward tiers.\n Cover art by Emily Hu. Color and inking by Gloria Caeli.\nWHAT'S IN THE TRADE?\nI'm glad you asked. Not only does it include all six issues from the mini-series as well as the cover art, but it also contains a Boston Metaphysical Society ten page short story called, Hunter-Killer, and additional bonus pages. With art by Emily Hu and coloring by Gloria Caeli, the story is set at the beginning of the House Wars (my version of the Civil War) and features the crew of a prototype airship. I introduce three new characters: Gwen Warrick - Captain; Emmet Rochester - Navigator; and Joaquin Medina - Engineer.\nAnd for what the story is about, well I have two words for you - Airship Battle!\nThe complete story of Hunter-Killer will ONLY be available in the trade.\nTHE MONEY:\nWhere the money goes...Your backing would enable us to pay for a print run of the book which means printing enough copies to send off to backers with some leftover to sell at conventions, incentives, shipping (which includes mailing envelopes, postage and handling.)

Inspired by fantasy and the art of storytelling, Holly-Rosing uses her imagination to create a fantastic story that is both well-written and fearless.\" - Valerie Complex (Fansided)\n\"If you have a taste for an intelligent, well written, elegantly illustrated award winning independent book, you can't go wrong with Boston Metaphysical Society!\" - Alex Yarde (The Good Man Project)\n\"This very inventive series posits a totally believable Steampunk world that is populated by appealing characters who act (and react) in believable manners to the extraordinary events that swirl around them.\" - Robert Sodaro (Comic Reviewer at Examiner.com)\nThe original series was also nominated for Best Comic/Graphic Novel at the 2014 Geekie Awards.\nTHE STORY BEHIND THE STORY\nFor those of you who have read the original series, my version of Tesla is not what you usually see in fiction, but it does stay true to his obsessive nature. Granville was a real person and a contemporary of Thomas Edison and Alexander Graham Bell. (He did business with both of them.) As a writer, I wanted to put my fictional versions of Granville and Tesla in the same room together for an extended period of time to see what would happen. Let\u2019s just say that Granville is more of a hard ass than I thought he was. This story allowed me to delve deeper into the lives of those who did not belong to a Great House, but were closer to the rest of us. Specifically, I wanted to show what it was like to live in Liberty Row, the middle class Negro neighborhood I created for this universe, and those whose work was used by the Great Houses, but never received any benefit for their effort.\nI love writing BOSTON METAPHYSICAL SOCIETY. Not only does it bring my love of science fiction and history together, (which by the way, equals steampunk), the steampunk time period allows me to address the themes of classism, sexism, and racism in America in a thoughtful and entertaining way. For at its very core, BOSTON METAPHYSICAL SOCIETY is an American story. And you can't tell an American story without including women and people of color.\nIt has been and always will be important to me to write characters who, though they come from diverse backgrounds and have different points of view, are able to work together for the common good.\nINCENTIVES\nIn addition to THE SCOURGE OF THE MECHANICAL MEN, we are offering the trade paperback which includes a brand new ten page story, a BRAND NEW bookmark, the anthologies, Boston Metaphysical Society: Prelude and Some Time Later, and a NEW BMS TRIQUETRA LAPEL PIN.

The Kickstarter is for a print run of #2 (and #1!) of the mini-series. The comic is a perfect balance of 50's sci-fi, 80's action, and everyday life.\nThe first Kickstarter for Prospects #issue 1 was a Kickstarter staff pick and funded in just 100 hours.\nStory:  \nThe town of Ridgeville has been stuck in the middle of a 150-year-old battle between two mad scientists, and former colleagues, Edwin Grabowski and Victor Farsimov. Both claim to have figured out the secret of immortality and created armies of zombies and cyborgs using their respective methods. The scientists have waged a war for so long within the town that the townspeople now consider it an honor to be abducted by one of the mad scientists in their quest for glory. Anyone who shows any bit of potential, be it brains, brawn, or anything in between, will be captured by one of the scientists by the time they are 25 years old. \nOn the outside looking in is 30-year old Colin Bates, who isn\u2019t one of the prospects. He has been selected by no one, not by scientists, girls, or even friends. He spends most of his days watching TV in his basement where he avoids doing odd jobs for his Grandma and her friends. Everything changes when a notorious terrorist, intent on destroying both scientists, appears in Colin\u2019s basement begging Colin to take over his legacy. \nOn the inside looking out is 18-year old Andrew Russell. Andrew has it all, the brains, brawn, and looks to be whatever he wants: the ultimate 5 tool prospect. The problem is that the whole community wants him to be a soldier for one of the scientists, while he just wants a normal 18-year-old life. He has to deal with the pressure of the town, especially his mom, about every aspect of his day AND the thought that he can be abducted by one of the scientists at any moment.\nAccolades\nPreview\n            Meet the Team\nMax Majernik (Writer) @SnowballMax I currently reside in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. I have a passion for writing and took classes such as dramatic and theater writing in college in hopes of getting a dramatic writing degree.

This past year, I felt compelled to go back to my creative writing background and to focus my free time on writing an original idea.

SFC is world of super powered sports entertainment. These solo series are a chance to get to know the characters outside of the ring. \nKasai Starting Out\n The Story\nKasai returning home to Kyoto to find her estranged demi-God father has broken his promise to his sister, Mizuhame, the goddess of water, never to fight again. Though Kasai begs him to stop, he refuses and Mizuhame exacts her revenge by kidnapping him. Now, Kasai must face her own fears to rescue a father who once abandoned her.\n The Cast \n Kasai is a demi god who burned her mom at birth. She spent many years in an orphanage until her father Kagu wanted to train her. She stayed with her father for a few years then left to be on her own. She stumbled into the world of Super powered wrestling in her late teens. After a few years she was a big hit in Japan. Samson, CEO of SFC brought her to America to be a big star\nKagu-tsuchi aka Kagu is god of Fire who burned his mother at birth. He is the estranged father of Kasai. He is a care-free spirit that likes to have fun.\nMizuhame is water goddess with a stern belief of a seperation of mortals and deities. She is deeply bothered by the interaction of beings\n We can try to use words to try to convince but let's allow the comic to speak in this preview\n     WHY THIS STORY?\nWhen Marcel Dupree, editor and co-founder of Evoluzione Publishing and SFC Comics, approached me about writing Kasai, I was absolutely thrilled. I love mythology and action and though I\u2019m not a pro-wrestling fan per se, I have a deep respect for their athletic skills. (Whoever tells you pro-wrestling isn\u2019t real doesn\u2019t know what they are talking about. It\u2019s scripted, but every hit is real as are the injuries.) We talked about the world of the Super Fighting Championship and the mythos behind Kasai. It was clear that we had the makings of a complex character on our hands and I ran with it. But Kasai isn\u2019t just about action and the ring, at its heart it is a father-daughter story. One that is fraught with resentment, trust issues, and love.\nPlease join us as we explore this world and journey with our characters into the unknown. I think you\u2019ll like it and the lizards. Especially, the lizards.\n   BONUS REWARDS\n SFC Comics believes in rewarding loyalty. All previous backers of SFC Comics Kickstarters get this print for free when they pledge $10 or more to Kasai: The Homecoming #1.\nBoston Metaphysical - The Scourge of the Mechanical Men backers who also back Kasai: The Homecoming #1 at the $10 level get this print for free. \nCROSSOVER PRINTS\n If you back both Sword Theory #1 and Kasai: The Homecoming #1 at the $10 you get this free print by Phil Buckenham and Marco Pagnotta.

No joke!\nBeing a parent of three children, I wanted something that would be fun for me to read as well as educational. Being a nerd-fan of all things geeky, I included pop-culture easter-eggs for the parents.

Faced with the disappearance of dreams by every man, woman and child the world is thrown in turmoil and it's up to SteamBear and his compatriots to save the world from curmudgeonry.

The book received rave reviews when it debuted in 2015 with a sci-fi theme and then went on to become a fan and creator favorite in 2016 (and three times the size) featuring a theme of super powers.\nThis year's theme is crime.  \nPacked with 38 stories and clocking in at 336 pages, it's the first IF Anthology title that will contain mature content.  Stories will range from the impact that crime has on the lives it affects, the psychological and sociological factors that lead people down its path, to the way people deal with being victims of a crime. Crime-fighting has long been a staple of comic book storytelling, and this thrilling and thought-provoking graphic novel anthology will be no exception to that rule.\n2018 \"Horror\" and 2019 \"Hope\" -- coming soon!\nI see that the book is available for pre-order on Amazon and at comic shops when I use code SEP171104, so why should I pre-order on Kickstarter?\nThe IF Anthology began its life on Kickstarter and each year we've grown. It only feels right to be able to offer something unique to the Kickstarter community, whether that be signed copies of books, original artwork, sketches, merchandise, or even the ability to catch up on previously released versions and support directly.\nIf you'd like to pre-order the book at your local comic shop or on the website of your choice, by all means please do so. We're just trying to provide another means to get the book to people that want to support directly or people that would like to get things like original art, commissions, or signed/sketched in books.\nLike last year, we're raising funds for the shipping cost of getting creators their books.  We have nearly 100 creators on board with over 20 that live outside the US.  Shipping is expensive and nearly everything raised of the initial $1000 goal will go towards those costs.\nWho is involved on this year's book?\n2017's IF Anthology features a cover by series creator Peter Simeti (that's me!) and over 100 creators involved.\nWRITERS:\nDaniel Santos - Brian Level - Cody Sousa - Brian Funk - Ashley Victoria Robinson - Jason Inman - Luis Roldan Torquenada - Jacoby Salcedo - Jerry Willoughby - Tyler Wentland - Ben Rosenthal - Glenn M\u00f8ane - Paul Axel - Rob Pilkington - Dave Swartz - Par Thorn - James E.

Due to this, he has enemies both legal and criminal, that want to end ventures permanently. Throughout this chaos, Luna hopes to help him achieve redemption, while he's still breathing that is.\n*If you missed Coronary: Episode One - don't worry!

To protect what was left of their culture, the Sunmakers sealed themselves away from the doomed world. Now, their numbers have dwindled, and Tibhan, the last of the Sunmakers, must risk everything by returning to the desolate wastes to find fuel for the fire that preserves his people's essence.\nEven if the cost is great and unthinkable.\nThis is the first chapter of a three issue mini-series. \nSunmaker is for those who like their fantasy with dark undertones but don't always want apocalyptic scenario's that are gray and drab.\n     A fantasy story that takes place in a vivid apocalyptic world.\nStrong theme of legacy and what happens when your values challenge your morals.\nA story that features the struggle of realizing for something to thrive something else may have to be sacrificed.\n22 pages of full-color sequentials plus 6 pages of extras which include a pinup gallery. That's a whole 28 pages total!\n6.625 x 10.25 on 70lb gloss paper with a 85lb gloss cover.\n             \"When are you going to stop talking about making comics and actually make a comic?\"\nNot exactly the words you want to hear from your significant other, but for me they rang true and struck deep. They pushed me to take action.\nAnd then?\nI found the script for Sunmaker on an online editing column called The Proving Grounds, which is found on the ComixTribe website. I was captivated by the characters and the dialog, especially the villains catch phrase, \"All things return to the cold!\"\nI had to tell Liam how much I loved the script, which ended up kicking off Sunmaker coming to life. My hope is to capture as much energy and excitement that I felt the when I initially read the story and bringing that to each page.\nNow what?\nSunmaker is my first comic, and the thought of holding it in my hands...heck, the thought of anyone being able to hold it in their hands... is nothing short of empowering. I eagerly await the first time I get to open a box filled with comics that I helped create. It's a huge milestone.\nWith having printed books, the next big milestone will be the ability to attend cons. Being on the other side of the table and sharing a story I helped bring to life feels like one of the biggest joys of making comics.\nStories are meant to be shared.\n    \"After reading an early preview of Sunmaker, my only question is, 'When can I see issue 2?'\"\n          -James W. Powell, TEN31 Publishing\n \"Ryan Kroboth's art crackles with energy and style.\"  \n           - Clay Adams, Fried Comics\n \"Hayes and Kroboth pull off the difficult task of introducing a mysterious new world without spoon-feeding the audience. They build to a revelation that has me yearning to know more, and a climax that leaves me fearing what will come next.\"\n          - Kevin Joseph, Kechal Comics\n    Don't worry, I got you covered! Here is the first scene.\n                                         The book is 100% complete! The only thing left to do is print, and that is why we are coming to Kickstarter.\nWe are looking to fund an offset print run of 2,000 books through KrakenPrint that Liam and I will split for product to sell at conventions and other channels.\n     Most of the funds raised in the campaign will go towards printing costs. Kickstarter and Stripe take a small fee off the top of the campaign, with the rest of the money raised going to cover shipping.\n      Boom?\n         If this hasn't been enough and you still want to see more, then how does an 11 page full-color preview sound?\nShow me more!\n                                            I love comics. The larger majority of books I get are from creators themselves, so I appreciate when someone takes that little something extra to be sure that my package gets there in excellent shape.\nHere is a look at the packaging mock-ups you can expect to receive your reward in.\n    For tiers that include the physical book, sketch-in, and aluminum prints this is what your shipment will look like. All comics are bagged and boarded, then packed inside a rigid cardboard envelope.\nOriginal art mock-up packaging looks like this:\n  The comic is still protected inside of a bag with a board. Aluminum prints have their own bag to protect them from being scratched. The original art will be placed inside a rigid plastic protector, then inserted into a priority mail box to make the package even more rigid. Finally, that box will be placed into a large bubble mailer to protect your reward even further.\nBut the real secret?\nNinjas.\n  That's right. Your own personal package protector. These guys will keep your shipment safe, as no one wants to mess with a ninja.\nNo one.\nWhile I've done my best to attempt to select shipping materials that will best keep your product safe, I'm aware that things do happen.\nIf for any reason you receive a package at fulfillment with a book that doesn't meet your quality standards I will replace it at absolutely no cost to you.\nI know there are collectors out there, and I want your book to make it to you in excellent condition.\n   The campaign will run throughout September. Since KrakenPrint does all their offset printing overseas, there is approximately a two month wait for books to arrive. Books are expected about the middle of January, and will ship immediately upon arrival.\nBackers should expect to receive their rewards by February.\n             A big, blue caption box can't express nearly how grateful I am for allowing me to share my project with you. Thank you for your time and attention.\nI'd like to ask for your support in bringing Sunmaker to life. Please back this campaign today and join us for the fun we have in store for our backers!\nWith gratitude,\nRyan", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is my first Kickstarter campaign.

It was an honor to have him be a part of this film and it was a surreal experience to get a call from him, wanting to make sure that he did right by a character that I created.  His portrayal of \"Murphy\" in this film is absolutely disturbing and yet relatable at the same time; it's easily Roddy's best acting to date.\nDuring the course of filming and even afterwards, I had a few great conversations with Roddy that I'll always remember but the one thing I regret, is that I never got the chance to meet him, shake his hand, and say thank you. \nSo thank you Roddy, for being a part of this film.\nYou became more than a hero to me, you became a friend.\n- Peter\nADD-ONs!\nIf you're interested in adding on rewards to your pledge, please reference the list below and add the amount to your pledge tier -- then send a message or comment via Kickstarter to let us know what you're adding on. \nHere's a list of some of the most asked about items and how much it would cost to add them on to your reward (if you live in Canada, please add $4 additional for shipping, if you live anywhere else outside the US please add $7 for shipping):  \nExtra copies of the blu-ray/DVD ... $20 each \nExtra graphic novel copies ... $14 each \nExtra single issue copies ... $1 per issue \nBlank sketch cover variant ... $4 each \nAlterna Comics counter-top display ... $9 each (new!) \nT-shirt ... $15 each \nCustom short box (without sketch) ... $18 each (new!) \nCustom short box (with sketch) ... $40 each (new!) \nSketch card ... $20 each  \n9x12 art ... $90 each (add $50 for color) \n11x14 art ... $140 each (add $50 for color) \nLogo ... $50 each \nHand made felt ornaments of Sullivan and the Warden ... $28 each set ($15 individual)\nOn Death Row, The Only Monster Is Man...\nTHE CHAIR began life on Kickstarter and it's only fitting that we've come full circle like this.  The film is done and everything is ready to go to press.\nIf fully funded, will enable us to start prepping and formatting the film for a digital release as well (iTunes, Google Play, Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime, etc.).  As the campaign goes on, we'll introduce stretch goals and stretch rewards as we try to unlock new digital avenues of distribution for the film.\nHere's some history on THE CHAIR...\nTHE CHAIR started out as a print on demand comic in 2006, that was quickly turned into a graphic novel and released in 2008.  This year, it's been released in stores for the first time as a single issue mini-series - on newsprint - and for a dollar an issue.  Yes, it's been a long road!\nThe comic was created and written by me, Peter Simeti, and the pencil work was by Kevin Christensen. Erin Kohut, who wrote the screenplay, also edited the comic.  \n...and a quick synopsis:\nA man struggles to escape a grisly fate on death row in this intense story of betrayal, revenge, and humanity's horrifying capacity for evil.\nRichard Sullivan (Tim Muskatell) is an innocent man struggling to escape his fate on death row... Witnessing the brutal killings of his fellow inmates (Ezra Buzzington, Jacob Banser, and John Siciliano) at the hands of the prison's sadistic and psychotic Warden (Bill Oberst Jr.) and his crew of guards (Roddy Piper, Noah Hathaway, Zach Galligan, Derrick Damions, and Kyle Hester), Sullivan decides that the only way to survive is to fight back. But as he's forced to match the brutality occurring in the prison, Sullivan is pushed to the brink of madness and begins to suffer from the trauma that his mother (Naomi Grossman) subjected him to as a child.\nYou can learn more about The CHAIR on our IMDb page.\nThe CHAIR is now available for pre-order on blu-ray & DVD!\n  This is the \"Creator Cut\" of the film and is different from previous versions offered through Kickstarter.  While this version will soon be available in select stores and online, this Kickstarter campaign is the only place where you can get exclusive rewards like a \"piece of THE CHAIR\" with every blu-ray/DVD purchase (this is a square inch of wardrobe used in the movie and worn by one of the film's actors).\nThese wardrobe swatches will be chosen at random, included with each copy of the film, and will come with a signed Certificate of Authenticity and a tamper proof seal.\n  THE CHAIR had a limited theatrical release in 2016. It made its debut in Burbank, CA.\n   UPCOMING FESTIVALS AND CONVENTIONS\nTHE CHAIR is currently touring conventions and film festivals as well.
