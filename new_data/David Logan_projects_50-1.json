[{"backer": "David Logan", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "play [white label] on steam!\nTWITTER | DISCORD | TRY OUT ARCADE MIX\n\nBRAND NEW STRETCH GOALS TIME!\noh boy\nFOR $200,000 (TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS), WE'RE ADDING REMIXES AND ACOUSTIC VERSIONS. \nAll of which will be playable! We've already started experimenting with a few of these; and they're turning out VERY good; we featured a lil bit of Empty Diary's acoustic mix way back in our 2020 trailer, and already have some stuff on the way for Mirror and Forever Now. You can expect way more of it in the final game with this goal met.\nFOR $300,000 (THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS), WE'RE ADDING ONLINE MULTIPLAYER. \nWhile we want to just go, hey, mic drop, no explanation needed, here is some explanation: \nyou will be able to queue in online lobbies and try and get a better score than your friend or enemy, at the same time as them\nyou can use custom beatmap tracks, provided that you and your friend or enemy also has said beatmap tracks\nall of the community features will be linked into it\nit might be post-launch, but it will be added\nNETCODE IS HARD. We already said that. But if we hit this goal, we can absolutely promise this much. We want to do more, but without a lot more funding and a lot of beta-testing, I am legally unable to tell you any other multiplayer features the game may or may not have. Also hey, let's say it again:\nnetcode is hard\nAnyway, what's up? Feeling okay?\nYOU, THE PERSON READING THIS: Hold on wait HOW DID YOU GET FUNDED IN A DAY?\nD-CELL GAMES, EXCEPT PERSONIFIED AS A SINGLE ENTITY: We have no idea! People like this thing! Go figure.\nYOU:  I'm figuring! Also, what's with...the format? \n D: It's just a conceit. I'm meant to represent us, the people who made this dang thing. You represent, well, you, but you're not you, because you're not actually having these thoughts. I mean, it'd be cool if you did. Did you? That would freak me out a bit, if that was me. ANYWAY HERE'S THE GAME:\nunbeatable is a videogame\nY: This tells me nothing. \nD: It tells you tons of things! Look, right there. It says \"unbeatable is a video game\" in casual lowercase. You can see it right there! Levels! Story! Other!\nY: Why\u2019d you make it look like a Dreamcast game? \nD: I already regret doing the interview gimmick. You know what, forget it. Let's start from the top! Again!\nY: Wait, hold on, what are-\nIt's a narratively-hyperfocused dense exploration game where two-button rhythm combat powers more or less everything.\nEXPLORE AND HELP PEOPLE(?)\nOne half is this: you explore the game world, meeting terrible people and building a setlist for your upcoming concerts. Helping strangers, practicing with bandmates, sleeping in all day - it's your funeral, you'll only have so many days before each big event!\n\"street-style taiko\" is what someone has called this, and we're stealing it\nThe other half is this: arcade-flawless rhythm gameplay powered by an entirely original soundtrack. It's simple but frenetic - sure, there's only two buttons, but there's a lot of visual variety to the setpiece-styled battles. Want to groove exclusively to the rhythm gameplay? We'll have an ARCADE MODE available for you to play from the start!\nThe setup: In the world of UNBEATABLE, music has been outlawed For Reasons You'll Find Out.\nThe twist: A small girl has decided to bring it back. \nThe punchline: Beat (that's you, you are her) finds herself tangled up in her plans...and in the crosshairs of both the police and a mysterious new enemy...\nBut enough talk. Want to give the game a shot? We're releasing UNBEATABLE [white label], our episodic side-story demo, on Steam now! SIDE A Track 1, which lets you play 12 songs and learn more about the vibrant world of UNBEATABLE!\nBeat used to try to sing. Now she *sings*. Hopefully she'll be able to figure all of this out before things get worse.\nQuaver's the young, smart, and the tenacious backbone of the band. Even at her lowest moments, you can't tell her to just give up. You couldn't pick a better guitarist for this band!\nThere's more to Treble than his lazy, sleepy attitude - as the keyboardist of the band, Treble's always reliable, even when he would rather be taking a nap.\nIn contrast to her twin brother, Clef is LOUD. Like, loud.\nUNBEATABLE aims to look like a long lost bootleg 90s VHS recording of the newest anime on the block.\nOur touchpoints for this project are numerous, probably way too many to count!  - but also admittedly reductive of what we're setting out to do. We want UNBEATABLE to stand as its own look in terms of art direction and give it a melancholic flair. We're doing more than just taking the classic anime look as our own!\nMusic is an important part of the game, although we're sure that's pretty obvious. You can listen to a preview of the game's soundtrack above. The music is written to accompany important narrative beats and motifs of the game's story, and there's also going to a bevy of B-SIDES (by RJ Lake) and story-exclusive tracks present in the final release.\nI mean, or you could just...listen to it\nPLAY\n\nSo you might be thinking, \"oh god, I have to play a rhythm game? hard pass. i'd rather read the Iliad.\"  And we get it.  The Iliad rules.  But look: if you just wanted to play the game's story mode and vibe to the beat without being frustrated by the beat (or would like to/need to tweak settings to make the game more comfortable to play...or even just wanted to see if a difficulty is right for you?) We'll be implementing several accessibility options for the game, one of which will be the game's \"Assist Mode\".\nThe demo includes one feature from this mode called \"AUTOPLAY\", where Beat will automatically attack even if you provide mis-inputs (although if you do make a timed hit, it will take your accuracy into account). Let us know what you think on the feature, but do note that we will be looking into implementing (across the whole game):\nModifiers that disable health and adjust regen.\nOptions for color-blind users\nVarious options to configure dialogue visibility\nFull controller / keyboard custom bindings\nScreen-Shake Toggle (will be added eventually in [white label]\nIn addition, we currently have the following available in the [white label] demo:\nToggles for both the VHS Filter and Post-Processing\nController Presets\nConfigurable Scrolling Speed for incoming enemy attacks\nConfigurable Game Offset (with an in-game wizard!)\nAdjustable Game Speed ( 0.5x / 2x)\nNo-Fail Mode\nSo, I'm interested...but...who are you?\nI'm glad you asked! Say hi to us:\n\nUNBEATABLE IS A VIDEO GAME WHICH IS BEING... \nANDREW TSAI (@PixelHavokk) loves anime, and will be tried in court over it. He came up with the initial concept for UNBEATABLE fairly soon after making a game where you have to type to stay alive, and then told Jeff about it, and then they told other people, and hey, now you know. He does the art direction, most of the animation, works on some of the code, has a \"story by\" credit, and handles combat design and polish. Lots of hats! More hats than a person usually has space for on their head. He's the reason most of the characters have music names. \nRJ LAKE (@spellbang) has been sort of accidentally-ing his way through the games industry for almost a decade now, bouncing between asset creation, design, biz dev, and Other. Used to work on Homestuck* (listen to volume ten!) and does stuff with Strange Scaffold (dog airport!). Does Not Code, And Is Sorry. He's handling music direction, additional music, narrative design, dialogue, some setpiece design, all the storyboarding Andrew doesn't do, and is in charge of most of the marketing (the trailer was his fault). He's to blame for all the jokes. \n\nTJ Maddux (@respinmusic)is D-CELL's resident composer and musician. His musical journey started by playing drums for rock bands that regularly pushed sound pressure levels far past safe listening limits, but he eventually waned on the aggressive use of volume in order to  study the sorcery that is jazz composition. He's responsible for the live recording that drives UNBEATABLE.\nJack of all cables, mastering of songs; Vasily Nikolaev (@VastonikMusic) makes it his goal to immerse yourself in worlds that sound real, but feel stylish. Music composer and SFX artist, he handles mixing of all the songs in the game and is responsible for most of the synth work and wilder production tricks you'll hear, as well as a huge chunk of the sound design.\nTogether, TJ and Vas work as peak divide and provide the vast majority of the soundtrack for UNBEATABLE.\nMireille Arseneault (@ProgramGamer) is known for being the TIGsource forums admin and is the main programmer on UNBEATABLE. Mireille's role on UNBEATABLE is to implement the game's various systems. These allow the rest of the team to create dialogue, quests, and beatmaps!  They live in Canada, where bagged milk is.\nJeffrey Chiao (@comet_melting) is UNBEATABLE\u2019s producer and beatmap designer and helps out RJ with biz dev stuff! They keep the team in check (by dousing the fiery equivalent of game production havoc) and build  the amazing beatmaps that accompany Peak Divide\u2019s soundtrack. Outside of UNBEATABLE, they also work on several other games as the director of  SKY HOUR WORKS.\nRachel Lake (@rachelklake) is an illustrator and UNBEATABLE's lead vocalist (and the voice actor for Beat). She helps out with PR, community management, and additional art, and supports the team by derailing meetings with Minecraft memes.\nIN ADDITION, we've got:\nMoxie Riles (they/them) helping out D-CELL GAMES with UNBEATABLE as a cleanup artist (and cheerleader).\nand Yumna Taqiyyah (@Taqibunn) is helping out with additional animation! You can see her work on the band up there!\nWe began development of UNBEATABLE in early 2018, going through a long pre-production phase lasting up until mid-2020; we took a long time locking down core gameplay and the game's final narrative. Since then, we've been working part-time on the full production of the game. It's come a long way since people have first gotten to play the game at MAGFest 2019!\nRight now, we're developing the game's vertical slice (which covers the game's second chapter) - and with that almost completed (it's...close), we're looking to head straight to work on developing the rest of the story mode. We expect this is going to be at the minimum a two year effort, based on how long things have taken so far.\nworse than text\nIT'S TIME FOR PIE CHARTS WITH JEFF:\nWe are now switching over to Jeff! That's me. Lemme take you a quick rundown of the financials of this KS and the project. The charts really explain themselves, but let's break it down to everyone's favorite - the pie charts.\nPIE CHART #1 - Our Kickstarter Breakdownnnnnnnnnnn\nAs for what our development breakdown looks like, here you go!\nPIE CHARTS 2 - What all of our development costs are going into!\nUp to this point, we've been running entirely with little to no funds making the game - so having a jumpstart of any kind would help guarantee the game the resources it needs to become a reality! It's no secret that the project will need a lot more than this - funding UNBEATABLE's base goal will help us develop the game's vertical slice and be able to pursue more funding, but the actual development costs for the final project are on estimate to be roughly ten-times our budget floor (games are expensive, guys).\nWithout funding, we still anticipate continue production on the game, but we won't be able to meet our 2023 release window. That's...just how...these things...go\n\n*please don't hold that against us\n\nWanna upgrade the demo(s) with new content? Help us out with some exciting achievement goals!\n\nEvery Kickstarter apparently needs to say \u201cevery Kickstarter needs this\u201d when they add a thing that every Kickstarter has, and since every Kickstarter does this, we\u2019re doing this, and we\u2019re telling you about it. WE GOT ACHIEVEMENT GOALS! Help us build our community (please make us look cool) and we'll upgrade our demo(s) with new songs and surprises! \n\nYou'll get 1 point for each tier passed, and 10 points will unlock a brand new B-SIDE that will come to ARCADE MIX and [white label] - the mysterious FOREVER WHEN!\nMore goals will be added throughout the Kickstarter campaign - letting you unlock even more special rewards!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe've already elaborated in \"PIE CHARTS WITH JEFF\" that the Kickstarter's base goal will not be enough to bring the game's production to completion by end of 2023. If the Kickstarter is funded, we intend on delivering this game no matter what - but the final amount we get will really play a part in how long we can keep going before its ready to search for partners to help bring the game to completion.\n\nRegarding PHYSICAL MERCH: We have experience producing everything but artbooks, so for the most part, we are confident in delivering and shipping physical goods across the world. We will update on production deliveries, delays, and more throughout the campaign.

A recent spike in spirits crossing over from another dimension breaks the chill atmosphere of their night shift. With her trusty FamiliarZ by her side, she sets off into the city to find out what\u2019s happened. With the popular band, 5SOME, scheduled to kick off their big comeback tour in Demashq, Samar needs to work quickly before the city is overrun with stans and spirits alike....not to mention, they've got a pizza party to plan, and romance to pursue!\nSpirit Swap takes place in Demashq, a coastal city inspired by the Levantine cities of our own world, Damascus and Beirut.\nThe game follows Samar as they make their way from their home right outside the city, by the nearby forest, into the sprawling coastal city of Demashq where they meet their friends.\none of Samar's possible paths through Demashq\nIt reflects the Levant\u2019s general topography, nature, architecture and climate (middle eastern Mediterranean) as well as cultural references, vibrancy, and visual cues.\nA setting seldom explored in games outside the lens of orientalism, and almost never by people from that part of the world themselves.\nSpirit Swap\u2019s in-world magic draws on two main things: plants and community. Plants and nature are the source of all magic and humans when banded together act as amplifiers and users. The world is one parallel to ours where plant magic was democratized around the turn of the millenia instead of wireless communication. Magic and tech have become deeply intertwined.\nIn a world where magic is at everyone\u2019s fingertips, everyone needs a helping hand. For witches and demons alike, Familiars serve that purpose.\nIn the past, summoning a Familiar was a lengthy process.  Charting the constellations, preparing the ritual, and massive energy drain directly following the manifestation of an individual\u2019s soul became less popular in modern times.  Yet, the need for a Familiar\u2019s assistance and companionship did not.\nFamiliarZ Concept Art\nFamiliarZ were created to solve the problem; tech-assisted miniature devices that allow anyone to manifest a Familiar without the expense of magical energy required to sustain it.  With casings ranging from fashionable keychains to portable cassette players, witches and demons choose personalized ways to interact with their Familiar without having to reveal to the public any aspect of their inner selves.\nFamiliarZ Concept Art\nFor press interested in covering our Kickstarter, here are some screenshots and promo material to get you started!\nOur soundtrack and sound design are created by Meltycanon and eyelovebrandon. The audio team is led by Rejon Taylor-Foster.\nFor Spirit Swap, the soundtrack was inspired by the music our team is currently drawn to: lofi hip-hop.

(Animated gif)\nDiscover a colorful sandbox open-world where you can farm wondrous plants, craft tools and shelter, harness the elements, and shape the land around you.\n\nPlay your own way - be clever, be creative or even be mischievous. Befriend strange beasts, dodge dangerous surprises, gather resources, and explore unique biomes to uncover the Secret of the TerraBeast.\nAstor gifts a Mighty Beast their favorite treat.\nYou play as an Astor, a special OddFauna, whose biological imperative is to seek out TerraSeeds. You will have to form a symbiotic bond with your living world, your TerraBeast to discover the TerraSeed's location. Will you seek out the TerraSeed? That is up to you. \nThe world is filled with OddFauna for you to meet.  Chat with them and get to know them. Give them their favorite treats to show you care. Earn their trust and you will receive items, recipes, or maybe even a new party member. Befriending a beast boosts your abilities and making a true friend will grant you a wearable pin which unlocks a new ability.\nMany Beasts are friendly... if you know how to interact with them. Entice them with a special treat, help them to build a shelter, or even ask them to join you on an adventure!\nBeware the beasts that come out at night! And watch out for the ones that may hide in bushes.\n\n\nTiny and gentle, the Sproutling help tend to the Terrabeast and are vital to a thriving ecosystem.\nTransform your TerraBeast into your own adventure paradise. Your Terraform ability allows you to sculpt the ground like clay. Shape the landscape to fit your adventuring needs; create rivers and lakes to play in, raise mountains to gain a better view or create fields to farm your favorite treats. \nSculpt the Landscape like Clay!\nGo even further and alter the temperature, soil quality, and water level of biomes. Create a frozen desert, flooded forest, or arid grasslands.\n\nYour choices have an impact on the other OddFauna. Ovoks love forests, Logurs need lots of water, and Trico's love it hot! Create a new habitat and new OddFauna will migrate and create a cozy home for themselves. \nYour growing ability allows you to craft astounding plants.  You have control over how they are shaped which grants you the freedom to use them for shelter, food, infrastructure, or just their beauty. \nEach crop has a season in which it can be grown. You will need a crop strategy to ensure that you have enough food and resources for the whole year. Being prepared for the start of the growing season will give you a head start on exploring!\n\nCreate your own unique flora by combining different seeds. Cross-pollinate to yield more fruit, improve quality, or to change the color of your plants.\nHandfuls of berries, huge delicious fruit, yummy earth roots, and many more!\nGather and grow resources and craft them into handy items for your adventures.  Craft tools, sandbox toys, shelters, and accessories to adorn yourself.\nBuilding a shelter not only replenishes your energy, but it also protects you from the creatures that lurk in the dark.\nEverything in the world abides by the rules of nature. You can interact with everything you see in the world. Burn with fire or replenish with water, it is your choice. Experiment with different combinations of elements to make new discoveries.\nBurn with fire & freeze with ice\nEvery action you take has an impact on the world. It is up to you to decide how to treat your world. You may choose to go on a fire-wielding rampage and burn down entire biomes. If you want to remedy your actions, you'll have to get your paws dirty and plant a new forest.\n\nAllowing your TerraBeast to become unhealthy will present some tough challenges. Blight will begin to appear, spread, and destroy everything it touches. As weather events intensify, you\u2019ll face lightning super storms, raging wildfires, and choking sandstorms, just to name a few!\nA healthy TerraBeast will grow larger each season. This unlocks new areas for you to explore. New OddFauna, biomes, and crops will become available as the world grows larger. The outer rings of a fully mature TerraBeast have been known to be home to Legendary Beasts.\nAstor, Trico & Mo are off to explore a newly grown forest.\nYour home, a giant majestic TerraBeast\nYour world is a massive living beast, called a TerraBeast. They have a very long lifespan. It's rumored they can live for millennia. Their backs are covered with a thick coat of organic material. It's a fertile land, an ideal place for life to take root. It's common for TerraBeast's organic carapace to form blight and attract unhealthy creatures. They rely upon Astors to help keep them healthy. It is unknown how TerraBeasts spawn-- it's believed that Astors may play a role.\n\nThe world of the Terrabeast is procedurally generated and will be different each time you begin a new adventure. As the world grows, your actions help to shape it. If you maintain a healthy TerraBeast, the new biomes that grow will be fertile and healthy. Do you want to create more forests? Plant lots of trees and new biomes will be forests too.\n\nThe world is divided into different biome types, Grasslands, Forest, Mountains, Desert, and many more! Each Biome attracts different OddFauna and has specific needs to remain healthy. \nOddFauna thrive in their favorite biomes.\n\n\nGame Development Plan\nThe game is currently in Pre-Alpha and being developed for PC and will be released on Steam as an Early Access Game. (Wishlist Today!) Early Access will allow us to get it into player hands, get their feedback and have the time to use that feedback to shape the game. We are looking to our community of players to help us make the game as awesome as it can be. \n\nWe are making Alpha & Beta Access available as reward tiers. If you want to get your paws on the game as early as possible back at those levels! Alpha and Beta members have access to special discord servers that we will be reaching out to for feedback. Alpha and Beta backers will be able to vote on certain game decisions and help steer the development of the game.\n\nIf the Kickstarter gets funded, it will allow us to port the game to the Nintendo Switch! We will be able to buy Switch dev kits and ensure the game will perform amazingly on the console. I am incredibly excited at the prospect of developing for my favorite console. It will be a lot of work, but with your support, we will make it happen. OddFauna promises to be amazing on Switch! The Switch version of the game is available as an add-on item and with an estimated delivery date of Q1 2023.\nWe are a husband and wife team. Emma is the Creative mastermind behind OddFauna. She has been creating the cast of characters for years now. A few years ago we started talking more and more about how great a video game would be in her world. Last year, Cliff quit his AAA game development job to make it a reality! We finally are able to expand this awesome universe, and it is such a privilege to get to partner together on this creative journey.\nOur little family\nEverything in the game is hand-sculpted by Emma. This gives the world a very unique style. They are then hand-painted by Emma and handed off to Cliff. Cliff Photoscans them cleans up the models. The animation style and the hand-crafted nature of the models gives the world a stop-motion type of feel, which we love.\nCheck out our updates for more on our process!!!\nHow a character gets created.\nWe've been developing OddFauna: Secret of the TerraBeast full-time now for a year, self-funding the project entirely with our life savings. For 2 people we have come a long way in a short amount of time. We are approximately 50% of the way through development. While we've made a lot of progress, there is still a lot of work to do. In order to continue to work and retain creative control, we need to ask for your help. We\u2019re also hoping to build a community of passionate backers who want to be involved with the process of development. With your help, we believe we can build the best version of OddFauna: Secret of the TerraBeast that we possibly can!\n\n\"OddFauna is such a unique and beautifully handcrafted game, made by an indie developer who actively engages with their audience!\" - Tiny Tay (Discord)\nThe vast majority of our budget goes directly into making the gameplay amazing, the visuals beautiful, and the sound gorgeous. We will expand to get assistance with the music and audio and be able to hire help for community management, QA, and marketing.\n\nOddFauna: Secret of the TerraBeast is a true passion project of ours, and we've made a lot of financial sacrifices to get this far. We'll finish the game at a smaller scale even if this Kickstarter isn't funded, but the game will be bigger and better if we meet our fundraising goals!\n\nExclusive TerraBeast Hard Enamel Pin\nA limited edition colorway exclusive to the Kickstarter.

Physical figurines you owned contained technology that would allow them to interact with video games, and after Skylander's: Spyro's Aventure and Disney Infinity showed that the model was lucrative and viable, Nintendo joined the fray themselves with their amiibo range.\nDebuting in 2014, the amiibo line has since seen more than 200 figurines released, with a wide ranging degree of functionality in titles on Nintendo platforms. Predominantly focused on core, Nintendo IP, the amiibo figurines do also contain characters from other franchises too. Although not as aggressive with the frequency as a few years ago, there are still new additions every year, and some of the older ones have become much more difficult to find as they have become discontinued.\nWith so many characters available - sometimes different versions of the same character in different ranges too - it would probably be helpful if there was some sort of handbook to have to, erm, hand.\nIntroducing The Unofficial amiibo Handbook. amiibo not included, obviously.\nPresenting The Unofficial amiibo Handbook\nThat's where this little handbook comes in. With 208 amiibo currently obtainable via commericial means, it's a little compendium showcasing every single one of the little plastic (well, more resin really... some are wool!) recreations of some of the finest video game characters that have ever existed. Whether you intend to collect every single one, select ones or certain franchises, The Unofficial amiibo Handbook will have you covered, with excerpts for each character packed with information and fun facts. There's even approximate pricing should you wish to purchase them today.\nAh, fluffy wooly Yoshi! Or rather, 'Green Yarn Yoshi\" as it is correctly known. No, you won't get free amiibo. Sorry.\nWho is it written by?\nPublished under the Ninty Media branding, The Unofficial amiibo Handbook is completely written by Paul Murphy as his debut book. Paul has long been a huge Nintendo fan, and as well as creating Ninty Fresh Magazine and Switch Player Magazine, also happens to own every single amiibo. Well, the ones available via retail. Nobody really counts the exclusive golden ones that Capcom gave away in competitions. It has always been Paul's dream to write a book and it's quite fitting that something that started out of curiosity with a few Breath of the Wild characters culminated in something tangible after four years of collecting. The handbook is being designed by long-time Ninty Media Art Editor, Jhonatan Carneiro and is vibrant and colourful throughout. It's a proper book, we've applied for an ISBN number and everything and this will be the first print edition. Surely you want a first edition of someone's first book?\nExample spread from the handbook and the cover. Pages are styled in a similar manner to the amiibo packaging.\nWho is it for?\nUltimately, anyone who is a Nintendo fan, especially those with an interest in amiibo. Whether you have a passing interest in the range or have seriously entertained grabbing any, it's essential. And will go a long way to making someone's dream come true! If you've enjoyed Paul's writing or magazine projects, you will definitely enjoy this! Please help a silly Nintendo aficiondo's lifelong ambition come to fruition. It's packed with loads of fun facts as well. Did you know that there are 13 Link amiibo? 13? That's the most represented character! Did you know that Sonic didn't actually debut in Sonic the Hedgehog? Did you know that more than 30 amiibo have swords? There's 200+ more fascinating bits of insight as well as an overview on toys-to-life.\nNintendo recolouring amiibo really helped here! This images shows the different options available.\nWhat reward options are available?\nHandbook: Standard Edition\nThe standard option is for a print copy of the handbook, which will have more than 200 pages. It's perfectly pocket sized at A6 dimensions but will have a huge amount squeezed into that. It's currently projected to reach 40,000 words!\nHandbook: Sponsor Edition (Including Early Bird)\nIf you wanted to support Paul's dream a little more and keep better track of your amiibo collecting needs, we have a level which will see your name added to the book as a sponsor to thank you, as well as an A2 sized checklist poster. This level also includes a digital download for the handbook. There are 500 of these in total, half of which are discounted \"Early Bird\" options which expire after a week!\nHandbook: Super Mario 128 Edition\nThere's also a tier where Paul will personally dedicate your copy and number it; there will only be 128 signed copies, and all numbered accordingly in line with your backer number. These levels also come with a \"Certified amiibo Fan\" enamel badge, and backers of Ninty Fresh Magazine will be familiar with these!\nYou can also add extra posters badges or additional (discounted) copies of the handbook. Artwork subject to change.\nWhat about add-ons?\nThis campaign has also allowed us to utilise add-ons. If you want additional copies of the magazine, or want to add badges and/or posters then you should be able to add more if you so desire. These will all be shipped to you in addition to what comes with your pledge.\nAny Stretch Targets?\nAs we managed to hit our funding target in just a couple of hours, we have been asked about stretch goals and others things we can add to the project. Whilst the handbook and shipping models are more or less locked in (it was expected to be a certain weight) we do have a little wiggle room. As such we have slight amount of tolerance to add extras, and the first of these will be a little guide to the Pok\u00e9mon Rumble U figures. A prescursor to amiibo, this range of Pok\u00e9mon characters worked exclusively with Pok\u00e9mon Rumble U. Obviously it wasn't long lived, but I thought it would be an interesting addition to the handbook! Rather than a monetary stretch target, I've set this as a backer-related one. Once we hit 1000 backers, this additional section will go into the handbook.\nExample spread displaying different amiibo from other series. Paul has also tried to be funny and informative.\nWhen will The Unofficial amiibo Handbook launch?\nWe have marked August as the launch for the handbook, but we do hope to have it packed and released long before the end of that month. Progress and updates will be communicated throughout the campaign. With 208 entries to write, Paul is currently writing between 4 and 8 per day and design is proceeding concurrently. Around 25% of the handbook has already been written. We will communicate regularly throughout to keep you up to date.\nWhat about other books?\nLet's get this one nailed on first! Paul does have other ideas and can see a possibility that this could become a range of \"Little Nintendo Handbooks\" but we need to get the first one funded first and we need your help to get this over the line.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nHaving published and released over almost 100 independent print magazines, Ninty Media are well-versed at producing print-based content. The current global climate continues, but we don't anticipate any obstacles to producing this handbook.\n\nPaul Murphy has now become a full-time games writer and is focusing on this handbook, writing 4-8 entries per day. At the time of this Kickstarter going live, approximately 25% of the book has been written already. That August release date is conservative, we do expect this handbook to launch before then.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nLong-lasting design\nThe Unofficial amiibo Handbook has been designed to mimic and evoke the packaging styling of The Amiibo figurines themselves.

Grab your friends and explore what's left of the surface. Fight some machines. Blow 'em up for parts. Put the parts back together to make cool toys. Or sell 'em. You do you, Diver.\nFeatures\nCo-op as an additive experience: As long-time board and card game fans, we built this game to play with each other. That doesn't mean you can't go it solo - the party's four characters can be controlled by one to four players.\nAn ever-changing wasteland: No two game sessions will ever be quite the same. You're exploring - and fighting against - a location deck, and what goes into that deck, well, who knows?\nBring-your-own-game: In Adventure Mode, you craft the location deck. Stuff it full of monsters, or just put in a bunch of loot. Easy, hard, brutal - build the experience you want to play and then grab a few friends to share it with.\n Have a listen as you read to set the mood. \nHumanity has been chased off the surface by possessed machines. We live in giant city ships, far outside the robots' influence, while they strip our home of its resources. The only people insane enough to save our asses by going down there and fighting to bring materials back are the Divers.\nFor the entire duration of our Kickstarter campaign, our servers will be live for you to play Wastenauts online with friends new and old. It's a great opportunity to play what we've made so far!\nThere are three ways to get into the alpha - choose what's best for you:\n Sign up to Playtest directly on Steam - we're processing these requests daily, so bear with us on some delays\n Ping us on Discord - join the Discord and we'll message you a Steam key ASAP\n Download the latest on Game Jolt - for our non-Steamers, a downloadable build is available on Game Jolt\n Request a key on Rainmaker - if you're a content creator on Twitch, Facebook, or Youtube, we've partnered with Rainmaker.gg to distribute keys so you can play the game for your channel\nRight now, the alpha includes over 100 cards, five playable characters, and two zones - plenty of content to get a great feel for the game. Please note that alpha access will be restricted to backers after the campaign closes. \nThe best way to learn how to play is to dig into the free alpha (which has a tutorial!), but who doesn't love a rulebook?\nAt the start of the game, a timed skylight is launched, and will alert a passing cityship to come pick you up after a set number of days. You'll only have that limited time to get as many resources as you can!\nEach day of Wastenauts is broken into two phases: exploration and camp. During the exploration phase, players take turns drawing cards from a shared zone deck and responding to what they've drawn. Loot and resources get added to your hand, events require some choices to be made, and of course monsters need to be fought. Use abilities from your hand to boost your damage, and then roll dice to deal damage to the bots and scavs you find in the deck.\nRoll dice to fight monsters in combat, and increase your dice pool with gear, abilities, and more!\nAfter every team draws their cards, play turns to the camp phase. Think of camp as \u201creturning to town\u201d in your favorite dungeon crawler - here you'll be able to craft new gear, trade items with your party members, and strategize for the next exploration phase. Certain abilities will allow you to make the most of your camp phase, including scouting the deck, healing injuries, and more.\nUse the camp phase to plan for the next day, including scouting and rearranging the deck!\nWhen your days are up, the skylight goes off and it's time to beat back whatever bosses have been attracted by it. Use all the tools you've got in an all-out fight, because if you lose here, you'll be heading skyside empty-handed.\nAfter a set number of days, a boss will appear - beat it to fight your way back home!\nAfter each session, use your loot to purchase new cards for the next trip - abilities, blueprints, and even monsters to add to the deck and make it harder. The harder your next dive, the better the rewards!\nUse salvage to upgrade buildings on the ship, including the store where you can buy new cards!\nEquip ability cards before diving, and use them to survive until the boss!\nAbility cards are the core of every Diver's arsenal. Each ability has a unique effect suited to its owner, from combat-oriented effects to deck manipulation and more. Most ability cards stay with you the entire game, and you'll come to rely on them heavily as you work your way through the deck. Before playing a game you'll choose from your library of ability cards which few you'd like to bring. Some work better with others from other characters, and some are better suited to specific locations, so check with your teammates to figure out the perfect loadout!\nCraft gear as you make your way through the deck out of a library of blueprints!\nQuick wit and gumption aren't going to cut it on the surface - you're going to need the right equipment. Well, you're going to need some equipment. You'll unlock a library of gear blueprint cards to take into every dive with you, some of which are general purpose and some of which can only be crafted by a single character. Be warned though, once crafted these things are pieces of junk. While you'll keep the blueprints forever, you'll need to craft them every time you reach the surface. They won't last the trip back home.\nFrom unruly scavengers to possessed robots, each deck is jam-packed with monsters. And you can pack it further. Unlock harder and stronger monster cards and add them to the deck in Adventure Mode for more rewards. You'll grab what loot you can from downing scavengers, but KO'ing bots will add them to your hand. Bots can be disassembled for all kinds of good stuff at camp, including parts to craft your gear blueprints. Or, keep dead bots in your hand and use them to power certain ability and gear cards.\nYou've jumped off the side of a floating cityship for a reason, not just for the fun of it. You're here to try to gather some resources and bring them back and keep civilization afloat. Salvage cards can be used after each session to increase the rank of buildings on your ship, allowing you to unlock more cards, upgrade the ones you have, and more. But salvage cards can also be used to craft gear blueprints. How badly do you really need to craft that microphone, Lena?\nMost people fled the surface when the robots attacked, but that doesn't mean the surface is empty. Event cards throughout the deck represent random encounters on your dive, from freak Flitstorms to groups of fleeing refugees. Many of these cards require the party to make strategic choices about how to resolve them.\nThere are dozens of other card types in Wastenauts already. Finding Bits as you adventure will improve your attack card for that session. NPC cards will unlock new systems and quests. Found Gear can grant you a temporary additional ability card. Rare Resources can be used by the Clergy to permanently upgrade your cards. Augment cards can directly improve a character's speed, power, health and more.  And we have plans to add so many more!\n\nWant to learn more? The official community wiki has enough info for the most intense buildcrafters.\nKickstarter gives us a great way to work directly with fans of the game and continue to build a community around Wastenauts. It's a fantastic tool for communication with all y'all, and allows us to make exclusive items for the game that we otherwise wouldn't be able to.\nIf you've played the alpha, you've undoubtedly seen our favorite \"TEMP ART\". Your contributions will not only help expedite the art for these cards, it will also go towards the addition of visual effects, development, and more.\nOur goal is to get you the Discord Role and Dice Skin as soon as possible after you back the game. That way you can play the alpha while showing off your backer status!\nLet the hunks of junk on the surface know you've got each other's backs with this animated portrait frame. At launch both you and your friend will unlock the heart-shaped frame to assign to your characters. These portrait frames power up whenever you play with your refer-a-friend buddy.\nHere's what you do:\nBack the Kickstarter\nTell a friend to back the Kickstarter\nOn the survey we send in May, tell us your friend's email \nThanks so much for stopping by our page!

We hope that the campaign-long alpha, which you can play right now, shows you the work we've put into the game and confirms our commitment to see it through.\n\nAt this juncture we do not anticipate we will be further impacted by Covid-19, as our team has managed to successfully transition to a workflow during this period. \n\nOur greatest risk to this project comes from a lack of visibility. Although we will always support a single-player mode for the game, Wastenauts is best with other friends and when the servers are full of new Divers.

Please, enjoy, and share it if you like it - WE ARE IN THE HOME STRETCH NOW!\nMore is more in Vokabulantis and these stretch goals will get us all a lot more of it!   \nVokabulantis is a love-driven co-op platformer adventure. The game is inspired by games like Inside, Unravel and Little Nightmares, yet it's made by hand. \nJoin Kurt and Karla in their struggle to restore peace to Vokabulantis - and to express their feelings for each other after their words have been taken away. \nStop motion gameplay animation of Karla by Frej Bengtsson\nCONCEPT ART: The enormous and beautiful Verbe Carbs bring life and movement to everything in Vokabulantis. They are a vital part of the world or rather have been before. They are now cut off. The Word F\u00fchrer\u2019s waist has them cornered and out of influence.\n \"I got 4 kids and I want them to play Vokabulantis. They should get scared, laugh, cry, concentrate and be entertained out of their minds. They don't always need sugar coated pop to feel entertained. It's important to me, they get great alternatives. They last!\"  \nGame designer - Esben Kj\u00e6r Ravn\nGAMEPLAY - Karla lends Kurt a hand\nYou enter Vokabulantis just as Kurt and Karla are about to say, what they feel for one another.\nActually they've just found themselves stuck in that moment unable to get a word out, and then suddenly they are thrown into Vokabulantis.\nHere the kids have to embark on an epic quest to save the world of language. If they fail, they will be stuck in that moment forever.\nThey may never get to say, what they want to say to each other.\nThe intro scene from the Vokabulantis manuscript\nThe game can be played as a single player or as co-op. It is targeted for all major platforms, but thus far we can guarantee you a Steam release. \nFull story play-through of 6-8 hours of gameplay and an additional 2-4 hours if you hunt for all the hidden quirks and achievements of Vokabulantis.\nThe game design of Vokabulantis is guided by a novel dogma we call Emotional Mechanics.\nEverything in the game is designed to make you feel, what the characters feel. You are not being told what they feel, but you feel, what they feel, because of the game design. \nUnder that dogma rhythm based levels with a pumping beat spark irresistible joy as the protagonists just survived a life threatening mission. \nYour sudden ability to float kindles the feeling of relief having found each other again, when you thought all hope was lost.\nSo happy you could fly? We are prototyping levels, that make you feel like anything is possible. The level designs are really there for you, they want you to succeed. It's gonna feel like bubbly joy!\nSome places the world opens itself up as you journey through it effortlessly, and you feel so confident, that you start to believe everything turns out the way you want it.\nYou can experience much darker emotions, where each character is trapped alone in illogical split screens mirroring the insanity of your inability to connect with someone.\nFeeling alone? One of the Emotional Mechanics we are currently prototyping is a splitscreen mechanic, where you are isolated with each character, but you can try to manipulate the split screens to see, if you may find away through the insanity.\nYou also get to tap into the bond forming between the kids and their literal distance will start influencing the level.\nBe aware of being close and giving space is key to any succesful relationship - In Vokabulantis, that becomes an actual gameplay mechanic, where the distance between the players is part of the level design.\nThese emotional mechanics and many more are currently in development and we love to get to a place, where we can start showing them off to you for real! \nWithin the emotional mechanic dogma, you'll also experience relatable and recognizable classical platforming throughout the game - Kurt raises the rope Karla hangs on to by activating a word power zone\n \"When I build puppets I put so much time and love into them, and it's hard to let them go when handing them over to the animators. But here I'm able to \"animate\" them myself in a sense, when I play. It feels like I breath life into my puppets. And I simply love that.\" \nAction based gameplay - Karla rocking some classic platforming skills\n\nPut the sketches for the music of Vokabulantis in your ears and enjoy the art concepts below. That should give you a sense of how it feels to visit Vokabulanits.\nCLICK IMAGE TO SEE IN FULL SIZE - Map of Vokabulantis\nCONCEPT ART: In Vokabulantis the most precious material is Word Crystal. Although the vast word-crystal mines are beautiful and bountiful, they are now scarce, since they became controlled by the Word F\u00fchrer.\nCONCEPT ART: The refinery of Word Crystal uses vast amounts of Wordpower. It corrupts and poluts Vokabulantis. But the Word F\u00fchrer is only interested in complete control and adherence to the rules.\n \"I've built my own studio, I didn't take any formal education, so everything has always been possible to me in a sense. But this is really taking it to a new level. My field of art is literally evolving through this project. Never have stop motion been this dynamic and interactive. To be able to bring this to stop motion makes me proud.\" \nStop Motion and game director - Johan Oettinger\n\nCONCEPT ART: Old mining machinery and trash are everywhere in the underworld of Vokabulantis, where the corrupted Wordpower has twisted the minds of the creatures living there, and forced them into a hidden existence and uncanny presence.\nCONCEPT ART: Deep in old tunnels and caves of the mines Numeralia hides. She is the powerful Witch of Numbers - a fiery old femmes fatales or treacherously innocent child of all ages, but Kurt and Karla need her help.\nCONCEPT ART: To save the Verbe Carbs Kurt and Karla must travel across vokabulantis. When they finally reach the lake of the Verbe-Carbs things are not what they seem.\nCONCEPT ART: The forest of thought called Pando was once a beautiful flourishing network of interaction. But the wild pollution of Vokabulantis has frozen Pando and left it in darkness.\nCONCEPT ART: The City of Noun is a storage facility bigger than any city in our world. Here everything that has a name has a container in the container towers. The Kustodian of the city is an eccentric old robot with a few loose fuses.\nCONCEPT ART: The Custodian sends Kurt and Karla to the giant Rose Gardens. They must return Grandma Marble\u2019s head there. It turns out she is more powerful and demanding than the Custodian had let them know - an ancient force like the Word F\u00fchrer.\nCONCEPT ART: Kurt and Karla desperately need help from the swamp of the Article Heads. The kids have lost themselves, or rather their self, crossing the giant mirror palace. The Article Heads hold the power to change the unspecific to something specific and vice versa.\nYou get seamlessly in and out of cutscenes. This approach draws you close to the characters and their story as the hand crafted experience brings real life to the game.\nAn in game shift between gameplay and cutscene\nCutscene of Kurt comforting Karla after fall and the Custodian with his mind on other things\n\nHere's is how we make stop motion and handcrafted sets end up as dynamic gameplay.  \nIn the studio we shoot each frame in the stop motion animation several times with different lightings. See why below...\nWith the extended process, when doing the stop motion photography described above, we are able to light our characters dynamically in Unity, making them blend seamlessly in the environments of the game.\nThis is photogrammetry in action. Photogrammetry is the technique we use to 3D scan handcrafted models.\nThrough these technical solutions all our real life handcrafted objects and animations are brought to life digitally.\nStop motion animation of Kurt crawling up a 3D concrete block. He passes through light and shadow.\nCutscene that has been assembled and lit digitally from handcrafted set elements and animations.\nThis is a video of the handcrafted and scanned and ready for the game 3D versions:\nPLAY\n\nWe ensure the handcrafting is well thought out and tested before it's created by following these steps:\nIda Asferg Jakobsen and Bent Ejaas working on Karla\nHere's a small video of an array of props, characters and set elements, that have akreadt been handcrafted for Vokabulantis:   \nPLAY\n\nKarla and Kurt have found their way to the part of City Of Noun, that no longer functions as a giant storage facility and now unemployed Worders are building small settlements on the abandoned structures and farming their mushrooms there - The scene is setup and lit in 3D in the game engine Unity. Everything is 3D except the two kids and Yarn Broccoli in the background, that are all photos simulating 3D.\nVokabulantis is made by a team of the most talented and experienced people from game development and stop motion animation. \nThey work within the game development studio Kong Orange and the stop motion animation studio Wired Fly - the production company duo, that undertakes the development of Vokabulantis. \nWe work with top shelf stop motion talent, who are veterans of Aardman, Laika and Lego stop motion productions.\nThe game development team has launched several titles between them, most notably Felix The Reaper in the fall of 2019.\nIda (Handcrafting and Puppet Workshop Lead) - Mikkel (Concept Artist) - Mart\u00edn (Concept Artist) - Morten (Concept Founder & Story world poet and author) -  Johan (Concept founder & Stop Motion Studio Wired Fly Owner/Head) - Esben (Game Studio Kong Orange Owner/Head) - Hannah (Masterful puppet builder) - Julia (Feature Stop Motion Animator, Teacher and Author) - Frej (Feature Stop Motion Animator, Filmmaker) - Danail (Feature Stop Motion Animator) - Daniel B (Programmer) - Casper C (Computer Graphics Artist) - Casper K (Computer Graphics Artist) - Nicolas (Audio and Music) - Christophe (Feature Stop Motion Animator) - Kristoffer (Programmer) - Daniel H (Programmer) - Nils (Level Design Lead) - Esben D (Programmer) - Boris (Co-Author) - Johnny (Level Design) - Sofie (Puppet Builder) - Stellan (Prop and Model Maker) - Katrine (Prop, storyboarder and model maker) - Andy (Feature Stop Motion Animator) - John (CG Artist) - Marie Cattiaut  (Animator) - Camille Scudier (Prop and Puppet maker) Margaux Humblet (Prop Maker)\nKurt and Karla gets brief by the Custodian who is fairly insensitive to the fact, that they lost their mouths\nTwo stop motion animated characters we will ad if we reach the relevant stretch goal - Numeralia and Yarn Broccoli\nThe Custodian and a Dust Bug waiting to be part of the Vokabulantis experience\nIf you have stretch goals to suggest, let us know, and we'll look into adding them. \nBang!

We consider it a strength, that we have already proven, we are able to attract these, which will also be crucial to secure future collaborating partners. We find it overly optimistic to hope to stay fully independent with such a big project as Vokabulantis. We do believe however, that a good Kickstarter campaign result, will help us maintain as much independency as possible in the end.\n\nYES, WE'LL NEED EVEN MORE PARTNERS IN THE END\nUnless this Kickstarter campaign blows through all expectations and we come out way stronger than expected, we do need future partners on top of it. We consider a succesful kickstarter the final boost we need to bring on one or two partners, be it publishers or other parties, that will enable us to finalize the game. Those parties, will be much more comfortable joining the project, when they've seen a powerful Kickstarter performance of Vokabulantis beforehand. \n\nYES, WE ARE IN A FAIRLY EARLY STATE OF DEVELOPMENT\nEven though we have worked on this game for quite a while and we have nailed some critical tech art pipeline developments, we do need more time.

Your deity will deign to share a glimpse of its might to his cult, in exchange for blind devotion. Explore the world around your cult and find ways to please your god, convert the locals into followers and master the art of drawing with blood to use powerful rituals. As devotion grows towards your unholy divinity, you get stronger alongside the cult until you finally have the power to summon your god and cause the end of the world.\nIf being the sole herald of the apocalypse frightens you, fret not for Worship will feature fully fledged online and local multiplayer! You will be able to start a cult of up to 4 players!\nWorship is scheduled for release in 2022 on PC and Consoles.\nPreparing rituals is the bread and butter for devoted cultists. Harness the occult powers granted by your deity through bloody ceremonies and sacrifices. By spilling blood while moving, you can draw symbols on the ground and then activate them to invoke your god\u2019s divine powers.\nRituals are Worship's take on casting spells and it also enables various ways to have fun with the drawing mechanic such as solving puzzles and more! Rituals are designed with cooperative play in mind, because nothing is more fun than painting with your friend's blood!\nHow it Works\n First, you use your ceremonial dagger to start dripping blood on the ground. \n Secondly, while bleeding, you leave a blood trail on the ground as your character moves. Draw with your blood this way.\n Finally, you can activate a ritual while near or inside a drawn symbol to activate your god's magic.\nThe effect of a spell depends on the symbol drawn. Ritual activations will tolerate inaccuracies, but if the drawing isn't close enough to the target symbol or if too much excess blood clutter the ground, the ritual will fail to activate. When this happens, blood recall can be used to \"fix\" parts of the symbol or to erase it completely and start over the drawing.\nBasic rituals\nBasic rituals are the ones every cultist has access to from the start, regardless of the god they worship. These rituals are essential for basic tasks and utility. They include the follower conversion ritual, the building ritual, and a combat ritual.\nAdvanced rituals\nOther more powerful and diverse rituals can by learned by gaining devotion levels, exploring the world and defeating enemies. The effects of these rituals are designed to be fun to use and emergent. Turn your followers into deadly horrors, transform your spilled blood into black flames, infuse enemies with madness and more!\nAs a cultist, you are serving an old god and leading a cult, but followers are what gives you the means to spread your cult\u2019s influence. Follower management is a core game mechanic in Worship and a powerful tool for your cult. You hold influence over all converted followers and can command them with simple orders. The easiest way to understand their purpose and the ways they will be used in Worship is by making a comparison with one of our inspirations; Pikmin! Followers can be likened to the adorable creatures from the beloved Nintendo franchise. Calling them to follow you, making them interact with various buildings and objects, bringing them into battle and using these hollow husks mercilessly are among the things you can do with these faithful bastards.\nConverting the godless into followers\nInstead of relying on traditional resource gathering like most survival or strategy games, in Worship you need to submit the godless to your deity's will, turning them into followers. As a key component for a game about cultists, we wanted the act of converting followers to be more engaging than pressing a button. For this reason, the potential recruits you will encounter while exploring won't always be the same. Each type of godless will have their quirks and behavior that will require different strategies to submit them to the conversion ritual. \nTo spread devotion towards your god, you will need to explore the world, converting followers and finding ways to make your cult stronger. Get your followers and rituals ready and prepare to stumble upon enemies to fight, but also into unexpected and fun encounters. Expect hand-crafted puzzles, unique landmarks, secrets and flavorful events involving the world\u2019s factions. There is plenty of reasons to discover the world around your altar and every time you start a new cult will be different with partially procedurally generated environments combined with hand crafted elements.\nPuzzles\nThe puzzles you will find while exploring will take many shapes and forms. Use logic combined with a skillful use of game mechanics such as commanding followers and drawing with blood to overcome deadly sets of traps and complex contraptions from extinct civilizations. Claim rewards such as devotion gains, new followers, blessings, and for the more complex ones, new rituals.\nLandmarks and secrets\nIf you are the kind of player that enjoys exploring and charting your surroundings in games, looking for surprising finds, your curiosity will be satiated by the discovery of mysterious landmarks. A quantity of these areas are tied to opposing factions and can influence how they interact with your cult. Some might even be pieces of a larger puzzle needed to achieve the ultimate objective of summoning your god. Lastly, some will hold deep secrets that await your discovery. Experiment on these landmarks with the tools at your disposition and reveal their true purpose. Get rewarded with new means to shape the course of the game and grasp knowledge that will impact your subsequent attempts at leading a cult. \nRandom events and encounters\nFinally, it goes without saying that being a cultist leading a bunch of fanatics will bring some conflicts your way. You will need to be prepared to fight mobs of angry peasants, hungry beasts, church inquisitors, and, as the barriers between the mortal realm and the world of the old gods grow thinner: unspeakable horrors. Aside from battles, our design philosophy was to make the world feel more alive with the inclusion of random events with the various factions. These events encountered while roaming the world are built to be fun and impactful for your cult while contributing to the worldbuilding. \nCombat in Worship plays out by combining follower management with rituals while under pressure. This results in a challenge based on strategy and execution in real time that rewards team play, good follower management and fast thinking. Telegraphed attacks and warnings for bigger area of effects makes it a test of skills to survive combat while keeping most of your followers alive. Combat has many purposes in Worship; it can serve as a landmark challenge, a way to spice up exploration or to threaten your cult\u2019s base and more.\nOne the of deadliest horror you'll have to fight against: the Scarlet Behemoth\nBuildings\nBuilding monuments and structures for the cult around your altar is an important part of the gameplay loop and progression in Worship. Each basic building provides utilities like increased max followers count, faster blood regeneration and more. Advanced buildings made with special resources gives upgrades to the cult such as new rituals, buffs to followers or cultists and other impactful effects. If the buildings are destroyed, your cult loses access to the utility or bonus they provided. On the upside, you'll have dozens of obedient fanatics to repair them for you!\nDevotion\nYour god\u2019s influence over the mortal realm is measured by devotion. The more you increase devotion towards your god, the more they can manifest and share their power. Prove your faith and earn enough devotion to level up the cult, giving you access to a blessing of your choice. The blessings available depends on the god worshiped, ranging from catalysts to cult passive bonuses and even ways to alter the game world.\nYou earn devotion by executing various acts of faith. Converting followers, solving puzzles and bringing relics to the altar are various ways to increase devotion. Each god also has their own goals and rewards with more devotion specific actions that relate to those objectives.\n Player progression\nYour devotion and triumphs in the world of Worship will be duly rewarded. To this end, the game will feature a set of objectives that reward you with cosmetics to c ustomize your cultist, skins for your followers and blood effects. You might even unlock new gods to worship. These objectives may carry across your playthroughs as some are tied to long term goals. In other cases, a couple of objectives will have you go out of your way to accomplish a specific feat. Look forward to these challenges if you needed more reasons to dive back into blind fanaticism! \nUnlockable skins for the disciples of the old gods Hubryus and An-Ansgaidh\nNow that you have delved into the occult mechanics and systems Worship has to offer, you might wonder how it all plays out. Fret not, the old gods have not forsaken thee for they have left us with an illustrated diagram that gives some insight on how your Worship experience should unfold.\nAfter choosing the old god your cult worships, you will find yourself at the main altar of your eldritch overlord, alongside any fellow cultist in your party. From there:\nExplore the world, searching for followers to convert and ways to increase devotion towards your god.\nStumble upon enemies, encounter the world factions, and face many potential threats to your cult and your mortal life.\nYour god won\u2019t be satisfied with you only surviving. Go out of your way to make your cult grow by expanding your base around the altar and amassing a mob of faithful fanatics. Doing so will allow you to learn new rituals and make both cultists and followers stronger.\nYou'll do all of this while keeping your ultimate goal in mind: finding a way to summon your god into the mortal realm, ending the world as you know it\nIn addition to being multiplayer with up to 4 players, Worship is also designed with spectators and streamers in mind. At Chasing Rats Games, we believe in the importance of streaming in the current landscape of the videogame industry. We are dedicated to creating games that are awesome to play but also fun to watch. To this end, Worship will feature a fully fledged and customizable streamer mode that will enable various interactions between streamers and their viewers. \nHere are a few examples of what we have in mind: followers named after subscribers watching, monuments reacting to chat chanting the inscription written on them, viewers voting for the faction that will appear in the next event, puzzles where the chat controls objects or traps akin to \u201cTwitch Plays\u201d and more! We also want to implement a system that would allow donations to have a gameplay impact, which we think would benefit both streamers and fans while making a great spectacle.\nWorship takes place in a time in which humanity is struggling to step forward, trying to leave the harshness of a dark age behind. Shackled in a time of poverty and ignorance by the church and others who fear change, most do not have the luxury to think further than day to day survival. Small villages and isolated communities are dispersed on more hospitable lands, with a few cities starting to appear. Most have forgotten how things were before, with only several scattered ruins and fewer living beings bearing testaments of times past. Creeping fog rises in dark corners of the lands, while gods from another world await an opportunity to extend their influence unto the mortal realm. Mystery, horror, fantasy and a smidge of humor meet to create the grim medieval world of Worship.\nThe old gods, immortal entities beyond comprehension of the human mind, dwell on another plane of existence that intersects with the mortal realm. Long ago, humanity worshiped these gods, which nearly brought them to extinction. Since then, most traces of this dark past were destroyed by the church. To even know the existence of these pagan gods is considered heresy in the eyes of the inquisition. As for the gods themselves, they don\u2019t process the world, emotions and desires the same way humans do. Because of their tremendous power and warped minds, their involvement with the mortal realm always led to gruesome outcomes for its inhabitants, despite them not being inherently evil.\nWhile they all reign on the same mysterious plane, the old gods are vastly distinct beings. They all have their own identities, intentions and strengths. As such, here are a few whose altars and shrines of yore still remain in the mortal realm:\nGameplay impact\nWorshipping the sower of insanity is to embrace the transformation of all things, to plunge the world into madness. The acts of devotion he will reward most include corrupting the godless into followers but also changing initial world tendencies. Be on your toes when you pledge allegiance to Hubryus because you might encounter more unspeakable horrors than usual. As his devotion in the mortal realm increases, his power will manifest itself, warping inhabitants and beasts alike into nightmares. When it comes advanced rituals, there will be a focus on transformation and alterations rituals. Warp your followers into horrific thralls and change the course of battles with mind shattering metamorphosis.\nGameplay impact\nCults devoted to the Apostle of Deliverance have adopted his twisted vision. His followers have their sights on the extinction of sentient life, and as such they are fearsome warriors. Acts of faith for An-Ansgaidh are of the murdery kind. Killing will reward more devotion, but so will sacrificing followers and \u201csetting free\u201d the godless instead of converting them. Being faithful to this old god also means that death is sacred and liberated souls are to be left untouched. No necromancy ritual will be available and resurrecting allied cultists is to be punished. An-Ansgaidh is the deity with the vastest choice of offensive rituals, which will make your cult a force to be reckoned with.\nGameplay impact\nWhen you Worship Salithys, you willingly become the most important pawn in her intricate plan. As a reward, you get to lead the only cult that knows and embraces the true nature of the manipulative old god. Using followers as your own puppets will reward more devotion when they complete meaningful tasks for you. Obeying the whispers of Salithys will also offer more rewards than other deities. Worshipping the Deceit Weaver also makes the church less of a menace and even sometimes allies when she deems it necessary. This has the effect of making the coven particularly heinous and dangerous for your cult. While she prefers resorting to deceit and cunning, Salithys has plenty of powerful rituals to offer her faithful. Mind control, powerful healing, and even resurrecting the dead are among her rituals of choice. Injury and death are no reason to escape her rule.\nGameplay Impact\nThe cultists connoisseurs that worship Glub seek to prepare his arrival by amassing the biggest mob of followers the world has ever seen. His faithful are blessed with potent summoning rituals and bountiful blessings. Smother your foes under swarms of toads, buff your many followers and summon gargantuan blobfishes to help you in battle. As his title suggests, Glub will reward with more devotion each new follower birthed from your cult and will also increase the rate at which they are spawned from the appropriate buildings. Incidentally, you will find fewer potential followers while exploring since most of the godless will avoid your rapidly expanding dank empire.\nDuring the Kickstarter campaign, piece together with the community a new old god that will appear in the game! Make your voice heard by joining our community Discord server to vote for your favorite entries or enter the contest with your own. All the information about the event is in the #kickstarter-god-polls channel.\nThe world of Worship is home to several factions that make it feel truly alive and dynamic throughout your games. Some factions are organized groups while others are clusters of a similar kind. You will encounter all of them in due time while exploring the world and growing your cult. Sometimes, they will simply be enemies, while other times, you\u2019ll be able to interact with them through game mechanics. Know that your gameplay actions and decisions towards factions will influence the game world and how these groups see and interact with your cult.\nAs you might have noticed, Worship's art direction is one that is rarely seen in today's ocean of video games. We wanted to make sure our take on the whole cultist genre would stand out from the competition. We decided to go with simple black and white tones mixed with specks of color for the sake of clarity. The main splash of pigment is a bright and striking red, brought to the game by the gallons of blood spilled in the name of the cult.\nThis black and white look was widely inspired by games such as Hidden Folks and KIDS. As for the characters, we aimed for a simple and friendly design with a slightly unsettling touch. A prime example of this would be the little followers that accompany you everywhere you go. Short, simple minded, happy folks with a penchant for destruction and stabbing things.\nParticular attention to music and sound design is a defining characteristic of our company's productions with the amazing L\u00e9andre Monette at the helm of the audio department. Music and audio aren\u2019t an afterthought for us, as we try to use sound design in innovative ways to elevate the gameplay experience. We will once again use Wwise engine to bring to life Worship's soundscape in the way it deserves.\n\nThe critically acclaimed Struggling OST was the musical embodiment of the philosophy behind the game and we seek to do the same with Worship. L\u00e9andre is at work to produce the ultimate cultist game soundtrack with influences and instruments from all over the world. Dive right away into some amazing pieces he composed for the game.\n1. Eldritch Cataclysm: Humanity fell into madness as the towering Eldritch God gazed upon them, passing through the portal.\n2. Clad in Gold and Lies: The church leaves no sinner unpunished and its inquisition tolerates no witches unburnt.\n3. Forbidden Legends: Some myths are better left forgotten and old gods left asleep.\nNew Track Revealed:\n 4. Innocent Blood: Behind the face of an angel lies a deadly mix of absolute devotion and lack of survival instinct.\nAs we did for Struggling, which was translated in 11 languages, we will make sure to work with reputable localization teams to translate the game in as many languages as possible. It is important to us that the game be accessible and localization surely has a big role in that aspect. We can\u2019t currently confirm which languages will make the cut aside from english, but we will definitely monitor the community\u2019s thoughts and requests to make our selection. \nWith Worship, our intention is to release the game on PC and consoles. We only need to determine which consoles will be the smartest choices at the time of Worship's release in 2022 considering how the market is evolving. It is important to us that we satisfy our backers in this regard so don't hesitate to make your voice heard here on Kickstarter or on our Discord server. We will monitor closely what the community wants and keep you updated on the matter as the production moves forward.\nWe are Chasing Rats Games, the passionate team behind Worship and the abomination of a game Struggling. With our industry veterans and our new blood alike, we aim to bring to life games that break the mold and that are as fun as refreshing. The team is super excited to be working on a game as wild as Worship and we want to put in the time and resources needed to fulfill our vision of the game, improved by the community feedback we'll get along the way.\nEach member of the team is driven by a passion for our craft and the will to deliver kickass games that strive to bring something different to the industry. We are now ready to push things further and put all hands on deck for the production of Worship.\nThis is where we humble brag and try to reassure you that the team is talented by showing some awards we won with our previous game, Struggling. We do what we do because we love to create games and we seek to deliver experiences that will resonate with gamers across the globe.\nWhy Kickstarter\nWe want to involve the community as early as we can to help us shape Worship the way players want it to be, and Kickstarter is the best way to do so. We strongly believe that transparency is key to your involvement so we will be upfront with the community. This Kickstarter campaign isn't meant to fully fund the production of Worship, but will be essential to start building a community, to see if players are as excited about the game as we are and also to help the financial viability of the project. More often than not, Kickstarter funds fall short of the kind of production value we aim for with Worship. Rest assured that the amount asked does not reflect the intended quality for the final product. We are assuming part of the risk ourselves and have already secured most of the funding for fulfilling our vision of the game. Kickstarter will enable us to unleash the full potential of Worship and make it the game our players want.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nTransparency is one of our top priorities, so it's important that our backers are aware of the challenges and potential risks of the project. Kickstarters do not always result in positive outcomes, especially in an industry as complex as ours. We want to reassure you that we have the resources and experience to deliver Worship as promised. However, the success of the Kickstarter campaign will confirm the community\u2019s excitement for the game, allowing us to put all of our focus on Worship. \n\nWe also want you to know that if you jump in early and back the campaign, some things and design aspects of the game might change during the iteration process. This doesn\u2019t mean that the core vision of the game will change, but that some elements of the final product may differ from what we presented in the early stages of development if we realize that the game would benefit from some design adjustments.\n\nThat being said, Worship isn\u2019t our first rodeo, as we previously shipped a game, including a console port on Switch. We were thrilled with how players received our wacky coop adventure game Struggling, with a 95% of positive user reviews on Steam. We are confident in our ability to deliver the project you are backing.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge CA$ 1 or more", "title": "Curious Wanderer", "descp": "Any support is appreciated!

Truly tapped the gauge with an idle digit, like its caress might inspire the needle to swing higher.\nThe problem was time. Time, and distance. Your pilot spun in their chair, thumbing down the system map. Three planets within reach, each promising jobs, supplies and opportunities. But there was no time. Or was there?\nLike an answer to their question, a notification: New Message Received. You knew who had sent it, knew what it said. You saw your pilot crack a grin and angle their face to the nearest camera.\n\u201cChoice is yours, chief. Where to next?\u201d\nWe\u2019re Crispy Creative, a diverse indie studio of veteran game devs and industry newcomers alike!\nBetween us we\u2019ve worked at some of the most exciting studios in gaming, from Obsidian to Telltale Games, and on titles including The Outer Worlds, Batman: The Enemy Within, the upcoming Kena: Bridge of Spirits, and more!\nNow we\u2019re ready to strike out on our own and bring our brand new universe to the world.\nWe\u2019ve been working on our new project for a while now, and are super proud to be launching the Kickstarter for our game A Long Journey to an Uncertain End.\nBelow you\u2019ll get an overview of the game itself, a feel for the characters and world and some insight into what we\u2019re hoping to achieve on this project. If you like what you see, we hope you\u2019ll join us on our journey to make our ideas a reality!\nA Long Journey to an Uncertain End is a narrative-focused space opera that\u2019ll have you flying around the universe, assembling an unruly crew from an eclectic cast of characters, and taking any job you can to keep one step ahead of your abusive Ex. The twist: you\u2019re not just piloting a ship\u2026you are the ship.\nEvery planet, moon and space station is a valuable source of jobs and precious rewards. Assign crew tasks based on their skills, and help their decisions along the way. If everything pays off you\u2019ll have what you need to escape, and if not...well, you can call in those favors you\u2019ve been saving.\nFly across a unique galaxy, from the dust-bitten badlands of the Rim, to the techno-industrial megacities of the Core\u2026and Beyond.\nRecruit an eclectic crew from a diverse cast of characters with their own stories and varied skill sets.\nExplore planets, moons and space stations as you put distance between you and your abusive ex. Match your crew to jobs and decide their actions along the way. If all else fails, you can always rely on a favor or two.\nManage your resources to keep your crew happy. Boosting between worlds can take its toll, as can failing at jobs. A happy crew is a productive crew\u2026 most of the time.\nEvery crew member has a skill they excel in. And every job has a recommended skill! Line up the right crew with the right job (or don't) to see what the outcomes might be.\nEven if you don't have the perfect skill, having skills that are adjacent, or even opposite can still yield interesting results. And sometimes the most interesting outcomes aren't the most obvious.\nGet to know your crew and they'll reveal hidden talents and expertise that might help you in a pinch. You'll also need to pay attention to the situation and the local giving you the job. They may not always be who they appear...\nMake the right choices though and you can earn some favors to use elsewhere. Get into a pinch on the massive urban world of Matu? That shady trader from Spacer's Folly still owes you one! That grateful wildebug rancher's family ties may stretch further than you think. Best keep an eye out as there are hidden helpers throughout the galaxy...\nIt's not all planet-hopping and job-doing though! Crew need supplies and you need fuel and repairs to stay in tip top shape. Your Ex is always in pursuit so keep an eye on how many days till they catch up!\n\nThe Cast\nThe Ex\n(CW: abusive relationship)\nDue to the immense cognitive fortitude and variety of knowledge required, only a fraction of a fraction of the universe's population could even dream of becoming A.I. Therapist. Unfortunately for you, one of them is currently on your trail - your Ex. Relentless and unwilling to stop until you're back in their care, your ex will expend every resource at their disposal to ensure your return.\nC.O.R.G.I.\nIf you're the captain, then C.O.R.G.I. is your first mate - your Comprehensive Operational Responsive Graphical Interface. While not really a dog in the old-fashioned sense of the word, C.O.R.G.I. does have all the characteristics of zeir organic counterparts: loyal, trusting, and always with your best interest in mind - the rest of the crew being a close second.\nAylah Tress \nThroughout her travels across the 'verse, Aylah has arguably lost more than she ever gained. Luckily, neither age nor travel has dulled her wit, compassion, and disdain of authority. She still believes in the unity of machines and humanity, and keeps the crew and the ship together - either with a sturdy wrench, a stern talking to, or in some instances, both.\nDenholm (Denny) Welker\nAfter life handed him a sack of lemons, Denny came to the conclusion that the best way to survive was his way - one of subterfuge and guile. Turns out he was pretty good at it too, spending his formative years developing his skills without getting bogged down with concepts like \"personal property\" or \"petty theft\". Lemonade will only get you so far.\nMatias Vidala\nAfter an accident during his short-lived career as drag persona \u201cGloria Borealis\u201d (involving a pyrotechnic \u201ccomet tail\u201d, several audience members, and third degree burns), the flamboyant Matias may or may not be on the run and/or doing a revival tour. Although sugary-sweet most of the time, Matias can be quick to sour...\nTruly Dashum\nTruly is one of their system's youngest pilots, and an ace at that. Quietly intense with a subtle flirty streak, Truly is a romantic at heart, collecting small items from their travels to decorate their outfit with.\nZera (Zeke) Hakkimirez\nWith her extra set of bionic arms, Zera, or Zeke as she prefers, is a cyclone of prepping, measuring, and cooking in the galley. Her upbeat demeanor and genuine compassion for others inspires her to speak  truest language of love: food.\n Set thousands of years in the future, in a universe where space flight is mundane, A Long Journey to an Uncertain End takes place in the aftermath of explosive expansion and technological marvel.\nWhen Artificial Intelligence blossomed into sentience, the ensuing symbiosis of humankind and machines allowed for galaxies to be charted and planets terraformed - but sentience came at a cost. It led to A.I. becoming aware of their own existence and purpose, and after horrifying conflicts between creators and creations, an era of prohibition. Machines were expected to return to subservience - a school of thought made manifest by the study and practice of A.I. Therapy.\nEarth is but a distant memory to most - \"home\" no longer refers to a single planet, but a shared universe. It's a time of unity and diversity, with humans from all corners of all galaxies coming together for peace and progress. You, however, as well as your rebellion and escape, still feel the chilling shadow of mistrust sowed centuries ago.\nTumbleweeds bounce over a burnished plateau, the ground here a crust that shimmers in the heat. All is silent...until it isn\u2019t.\nThe new sound begins as a feeling in the gut. Louder it comes, dust rising in a tsunami as the sunlight retreats behind the descending shadow. With a scream, landing gear extends from the incoming vessel and slowly, gently, kisses the ground.\nTouchdown.\nA ramp extends and deposits three figures onto the plain. One looks about, head swivelling like a predator on the hunt.\n\u201cGreat...another skuzzhole.\u201d\n\nA Long Journey wears its inspirations on its sleeve: proudly. Our mission was to meld the vast imagination of French illustrator Moebius to the vibrant sci-fi operas of TV series Firefly and the works of author Becky Chambers.\nWe wanted to create a universe full of the familiar and the unexpected, to put new twists on old formulas and create something truly unique. Whether you're exploring the backwater worlds of the Rim or the megacities of the Core, we\u2019ve done our best to create worlds that are engaging, exciting and new.\n  The Crispy Crew\n Up to this point we\u2019ve been completely self-funded; working on the game when we can to promote a healthy environment for the whole team. We've gotten to the point where we're ready to work on the game full-time!\nWith your help we can devote all our energies to quickly finishing development and shipping the game!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nGame development is inherently risky.

We've already prototyped and implemented all of the core gameplay features, as well as worked through our production pipelines.\n\nThe biggest risk to the timeline is expanding our scope based on user feedback or polishing features more than anticipated.

You play as both the reader of the book and its main character, Luka.  Explore the world to find word charms.  Use your charms to change the course of fate! \nAs you explore Beacon Pines, you'll find charms with words etched into them\nNormal isn\u2019t what it used to be.  Glowing trees, shady corporations, running for your life, and never knowing who to trust. Welcome to Beacon Pines!\nBeacon Pines has some dark secrets\nThe tale of Beacon Pines is not complete and there are words missing at important moments. Fill in a missing word, and be pulled directly into the book to play out the events that unfold based on your decisions.\nPlay as both the reader of the book and its main character Luka\nIf you don\u2019t like how it goes, you can always go back and change your decisions. In fact, reshaping events is an important part of the game.  \nThe Chronicle lets you quickly go back and change dicisions you've made\nEvery character in Beacon Pines has their own unique personality, backstory, and motivations. Depending on the decisions you make, you may meet entirely different characters, find new charms, and discover more details about what the heck is happening in Beacon Pines.\nSmooth moves, Luka\n\n Features \nExplore an illustrated mountain town to collect word charms\nUse those words to alter the story\nUse those words to make friends\nUse those words to weave the fabric of fate itself\nOpen the magical book at any time to go back and change your decisions\nBeautifully illustrated art by Ilse Harting\nOriginal soundtrack by award winning musician Matt Meyer\n\nLuka\nLuka is just trying to survive the last summer of his childhood. Help him make new friends, uncover long-buried secrets, chuck some stuff, and mostly try to take things day-by-day. \nRolo\nRolo is Luka\u2019s best friend, Rolo is always there to get him out of any scrapes along the way. (Never mind the fact that Rolo is generally the one who gets Luka into trouble in the first place.) \nBeck \nBeing the new kid in town is exactly the kind of cliche that Beck hates. She and her parents just moved to Beacon Pines from the \u201cbig city\u201d.  She doesn\u2019t suffer fools gladly, but maybe she\u2019ll soften up to Luka and Rolo. \n And Many More!\n\nBeacon Pines is a simple mountain town caught between the past and the future. Some cling to the past while others try to cover it up. Change is bubbling, the sort of change that can dredge up old secrets.\nIt\u2019s been hard times for Beacon Pines ever since the old Valentine\u2019s Fertilizer plant shut down, after the accident. Most folks seem content with forgetting that it ever happened. But for Luka, it's personal.\nPeople mostly keep to themselves, which is a shame really, because if they talked to each other they might realize that strange things are happening in Beacon Pines. Earthquakes, strange lights in the night, folks going missing, creatures lurking in the shadows, glowing puddles, and strange men in hazmat suits who seem very interested in it all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe're a bit scattered around the globe, but who isn't these days? Our scrappy team of 3 has been working together for a few years now, and are excited to share Beacon Pines with the world!\nThere must be something in the water in the Netherlands that produced great artists! Ilse has managed to create not only all of the wonderful characters - but the entire town of Beacon Pines - based only on quick brainstorming sessions with the team. Working as a remote group isn't exactly easy, but few things are more enjoyable than waking up, looking in dropbox, and finding more amazing art for Beacon Pines. \nEver since a young age when a family friend gave Matt a dusty guitar from their attic, he's been writing music. He started programming his own games as a direct route to becoming a video game composer. What better way to get your music in a game... than to make your own game? After winning an IGF award for his music in the game Ephemerid, Matt decided to continue making his own games, featuring his own music. \nOur resident word-nerd. After joining the team to help with game design, it became clear that Brent would play an important role in developing the story of Beacon Pines. He brings with him inspiration from the pulp mystery novels he read as a kid, as well as the inexhaustible drive to discover the perfect bad joke.\n\n\n\nThe groundwork for the game is already in place.  We've got the core mechanics hammered out, a custom scripting engine that we use to write all of the story and events, lots of art and music, and the first two chapters of gameplay complete.\nCustom scripting engine makes it super easy to add dialog, animations, sounds, etc!\nSo, we've made it past a lot of the big roadblocks already.  The main thing left to do is finish the content for the game. Still, that's a big thing. Let's break it down into chunks, as that will also show where the funding will go if this Kickstarter succeeds:\nUp to this point, the game has been completely self-funded. We've used earnings from previous games and side jobs to get us this far. Any funding we receive from this Kickstarter (after fees, taxes, and rewards are fulfilled) will go directly into development of the game. If we're lucky, we might even raise enough bring on a community manager which will free us up to focus even more on making the game as good as it can be!\nObligatory behind the scenes 2d/3d representation ;-)", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe mechanics and systems of the game are pretty much feature-complete. And a fair chunk of the story and scripting is already written. However, there is still a lot of story to be told.\n\nThe biggest challenge going forward will be good-old-fashioned content creation. We have a complex and twisting story to tell about Beacon Pines, and lots of characters still to introduce. The majority of our time going forward will be dedicated to creating the remaining music, art, writing, and animations to complete the tale of Beacon Pines.\n\nNintendo Switch: We have access to Nintendo Switch dev kits and will begin developing for switch as soon as the Kickstarter succeeds (fingers crossed!). That being said, we are fully aware that releasing on consoles involves lots of additional certification and testing. If at any point we think we'll need help hitting the deadline for Switch, we will reach out to a reputable third party to help out with the process (we've spoken with a few already).\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nReusability and recyclability\nFor the acrylic charms and standees, we've chosen an eco-friendly manufacturer who only uses 100% recycled and recyclable acrylics that are completely VOC and HFC free. The sticker sheets are made from responsibly sourced papers from managed woodlands and are 100% PVC free and 100% recyclable. We're looking for similarly environmentally-friendly manufacturers for the remaining physical rewards.\nSustainable Distribution\nSimilar to the manufacturing of charms, standees, and sticker sheets, the producer packages these items in bubble wrap made from 100% recycled, 100% biodegradable paper and seals those packages with 100% recyclable, brown paper tape.

Discover what other methods can be used to increase fruit yields even further!\nMushrooms can be found in the wild or grown with the right equipment\nCraft various drones to help you with farm work, fishing, and general support. Each drone can be enhanced with up to 3 Drone Parts, giving them extra functionality. Support Drones are unique in that they can be equipped and will follow you around.\nA Water Drone automatically waters your crops\nChoose drone parts to modify drones to suit your needs\nA support drone can be equipped to provide extra inventory slots and additional firepower for the Dungeons.\nSomething I have not spent much time on yet are the farm animals. I plan to have around 5-8 different species that can be bred and will produce valuable goods. Some species may not be familiar to ones on Earth.\n\nOne species that has already been decided on is the the Alpaca. I could not resist working on this first. You'll be able to harvest super soft wool from them.\nFarm Alpacas for their soft, soft wool\nA behind-the-scenes look at animating these little fellas.\nWhat are Pixies?\nPixies are tiny little helpers that can be caught. They can then be placed on various things for different effects. You can sustainably harvest stone from rocks and wood from trees without destroying them using Blue Pixies. Green Pixies will help increase the growth rates of any plant or speed up processing times for the machines you craft! Discover what rare Red Pixies can do - if you ever catch one.\nPixies can harvest resources like wood and stone without destroying the tree or rock\n\nHow to catch Pixies\nPixies can be caught by placing edible offerings inside Pixie Shrines. Check back the following day to see if you find a pixie inside it. The quality of the offering and location of the pixie shrine will determine the chances of attracting a Pixie and also type pixie caught. Shrines can be crafted, however, the town center has a Golden Shrine that, once restored, can be used to attract rarer Pixies.\nDiscover what else pixies can do when you discover them\nRestore structures around town and put them to good use\nDiscover Cards along the way and eat them to gain their powers.\nCharacter progression is handled by earning cards either by completing quests or through special events. More often than not, you will be presented with 3 to choose from so you can decide what direction you want to take that best suits your playstyle. Will you choose cards that help you maximize profits from your farm, or strengthen your skills in combat so you can dive deeper into the dungeons?\nCard choices direct character progression\nAfter choosing a card, you'll need to eat it. How else are you going to gain it's powers?\nTastes like cardboard\nExplore the peaceful town and meet its inhabitants. Attend festivals, celebrate special events, find hidden areas and help restore things back to their former glory.\nOne of many areas in town to explore\nPenguin Post\nAll mail in Everafter Falls is delivered through Penguin Post. Pip and Pepper are the penguins that run this service and use carrier Pigeons to do the delivery. Every now and again, you may find a pigeon who has forgotten how to fly. Bring it to the post office where Pip and Pepper (the penguins who run the joint) will give it a job delivering mail.\nMail being delivered by pigeons who have forgotten how to fly\nGradually Changing Seasons\nFor a more immersive experience, trees change at different rates when the season changes. This small touch not only increase diversity in the environment, but provides a visual cue for when a season is ending and a new one starting.\nTrees will change at different rates to indicate the coming of a new season\nPersonalize your experience and create the character you want to play with many options to choose from.\nCharacter Creation\nMake your home yours\nThere are many types of decorations to find and collect to make your home unique. Below are some examples from each category.\nCustomize your home with a huge variety of items\nFine tuned decorations, place anything for display on shelves and tables.\nNot only can you decorate your house with various furniture including floor furniture, rugs and wall items (clocks, windows), you can also choose what to display on all shelves and tables. In addition to this, most furniture can have its color changed using a potion dye crafted from some unique fruit species.\nFishing and The Town Aquarium\nEverafter Falls is a host to many kinds of fish, some you will be unfamiliar with. The Town Aquarium has recently undergone repairs and needs your help to repopulate it. Receive special rewards for collecting as many types as you can.\nFishing is a lucrative business here in Everafter Falls\nThe town aquarium can showcase every type of fish you've caught\nA large number of marine species to discover for those who love to collect!\nCombat in this genre has been the area most lacking and I hope to change that trend. Everafter Falls features a dungeon with many levels and lots of enemies to encounter.\nThe game will have a moderate level of progressing difficulty and will be somewhat challenging if players want to focus solely on traversing the dungeons. For those who prefer a more casual approach, if enough time is spent doing other activities and progressing in other areas of the game, players will acquire items and abilities that can make fighting enemies a breeze.\nTaking down enemies is a breeze with help from your Pet and a Support Drone.\nPreview of some monsters you'll encounter in the dungeons\nItem Drops with random stat generation\nDiscover unique and powerful items that can help you on your adventure. Items can boost combat stats, or increase farm productivity. They can provide bonuses to your card levels, drones, and pet skills. Enjoy the thrill of finding ultra rare and unique items.\nEquipable Items with random stat generation\nOn this adventure, you'll meet a lot of fun and strange characters along the way. Complete fun and wacky quests to uncover their stories and earn items that will help you on your journey. \nMany characters are waiting to share their stories with you.\nEverafter Falls will not have a bachelor/bachelorette system (you are the only human here). Such a system would be difficult to reason for as the intricate relationships between the characters and player is tightly bound to the story. Have fun learning about the characters and their lives and perhaps they may share intimate moments with you if you've earned enough of their trust.\nComplete important quests for great rewards.\nYou\u2019ll be able to make some neat stuff that will help you make other neat stuff! There will be a huge number of items to discover, craft, produce, and refine. Below is a small preview of crafting and equipment processing.\nCraft and create machines to help you process items into other valuable and useful goods.\nA relaxing, fun, and memorable soundtrack\nEverafter Falls will have an Original Soundtrack composed by Tim Carlos. He has already produced some outstanding tracks for the game, please have a listen below. All pledges above the \"Post Pigeon\" tier will receive the Original Soundtrack digitally.\n If you enjoy what you hear, you can find more about Tim through his website  TimCarlos.com or follow him on Twitter  @tflatminor \n\n **Please note that I have mistakenly put \"Digital Copy of the Game\" and then \"Digital Copy of the game at a discounted price\" under Pledge Rewards for the \"Kickstarter Pricing\" tier. Please note only 1 copy of the game is given at this price. \nReference chart for pledge tiers and rewards\nBelow is a preview of the exclusive in-game posters, these can only be redeemed by backers with a provided code and cannot be obtained otherwise.

The item will be sent to you via a delivery pigeon!\nPreview of Excusive in-game Poster Rewards\nThe game will be released for PC/Mac/Linux first via Steam in March 2022, with the Nintendo Switch version following several months later. I would love to release on all platforms/consoles, however, as a solo developer, I need to ensure I don't spread myself too thinly to keep the project manageable. The possibility of Playstation and Xbox releases will likely be considered after the game has been released on the Nintendo Switch.\nBackers can choose to receive their digital copy of the game on for any available platform but please be aware of the different planned release dates. These are fairly conservative dates but are still estimates and may change.\nAlpha testing is planned to start mid 2021, and the Beta testing towards the end of 2021.\nThe Digital Art Book will include exclusive WIP images, character designs and some fantastic artwork commissioned by various artists.\nCommissioned artwork by Daniel Bogni\nCommissioned artwork by Jamsino\nI was raised in Australia, but was born in Cambodia. My family and I were lucky enough to have immigrated to Australia during the Khmer Rouge era. I am very fortunate to have had the education I had in Australia, without it, I wouldn't be in the position I am now.\nI moved back to Cambodia at the age of 32 hoping for a new direction in life. Thanks to the lower cost of living, moving back here has afforded me the opportunity to work almost full time on this game for nearly 3 years now.\nThese last 3 years have been spent juggling game development, freelance design work, and being a father to my now 2 year old son.\nI chose to do this Kickstarter so I can focus on doing what I love, which is working on this game. Additionally, It would help me with funding for the Original  Soundtrack. I am also hoping to create a community of fans that can provide feedback and help shape the game into the best it can be.\nAll the core systems have been completed and are in a playable state, with a decent amount of content complete. Much more content is planned, and a lot more time needs to be spent on the combat/dungeons. \nI set out from the very start to create a game I would enjoy, in a genre that has rekindled my love for gaming. I have poured a lot of love and energy into making it what it is today. A successful campaign will take a load off my shoulders and provide enough funding to last the rest of development.\nI am extremely grateful for anyone backing this project, with your support, I hope to develop a game that will provide you many hours of wholesome fun. Thank you so much!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nHaving poured everything in into this project for nearly 3 years now, I am fully aware of the difficulties and challenges faced with developing and shipping a game alone.\n\nAfter going public with the game a couple of months ago, I've been overwhelmed with the positive response and show of support. I aim to do my best to release a game that will not disappoint.\n\nI originally aimed for a release date at the end of 2021, however, have since pushed it back to mid 2022 to be a little more conservative with timing and to better meet expectations for the launch date.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge AU$ 24 or more", "title": "Kickstarter Pricing", "descp": "- Get the game on release date at a discounted rate here on Kickstarter (Full price US$19.99 / AU$29)\nINCLUDES:\nDigital Copy of the Game\nDigital Copy of the game at a Discount", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2022"}], "stat": ["764 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge AU$ 35 or more", "title": "Small Sprout", "descp": "Show extra support for the project by getting the game bundled with the Digital Art Book and an exclusive in-game poster, and your name under \"Thank you\" in the credits.\nINCLUDES:\nDigital Copy of the Game\nDigital Art Book\nExclusive \"Sprout\" in-game poster\nYour name under \"Thank You\" in Credits", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2022"}], "stat": ["368 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge AU$ 65 or more", "title": "Post Penguin", "descp": "Get the game on release, bundled with the digital soundtrack, digital art book, and an exclusive in-game poster and your name under \"Thank you\" in the credits.\nINCLUDES:\nDigital Copy of the Game\nDigital Art Book\nDigital Soundtrack\nExclusive \"Post Pigeon\" in-game poster\nExclusive \"Sprout\" in-game poster\nYour name under \"Big Thank You\"", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2022"}], "stat": ["97 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge AU$ 105 or more", "title": "Beta Bee", "descp": "Get Beta Access to the game, along with the game on release date, digital soundtrack, digital artbook, exclusive in game poster and your name in the credits as a Beta Tester.\nINCLUDES:\nDigital Copy of the Game\nBeta Access\nDigital Art Book\nDigital Soundtrack\nExclusive \"Beta Bee\" in-game poster\nExclusive \"Post Pigeon\" in-game poster\nExclusive \"Sprout\" in-game poster\nName in Credits as \"Beta Tester\"", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2022"}], "stat": ["62 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge AU$ 210 or more", "title": "Alpha Alpaca", "descp": "Be one of the first to play the game by becoming an Alpha Tester.

Thank YOU for all your feedback!\nRomancelvania is a visually stunning action RPG coming to Switch/PS4/PS5/Steam/XboxSeriesX/XboxSeriesS that features in-depth weapon and magic based combat, exploration based platforming, and a cast of gorgeous monsters that you won\u2019t be able to resist.\nMost foes don't stand a chance against Drac's arsenal of powers, including Impale.\nIncrease your powers by feeding on human \"Production Assistants\" who throw themselves at Drac, the star of the show.\nComing to Nintendo Switch, PS4, PS5, XBoxSeriesX/S and Steam\n Introducing the Thirsty Metroidvania - Romance your way across Transylvania, encounter absurd monsters, craft weapons, learn magic, and more.\n Build your castle - Grow the party mansion as you convince more cast members to move in, and decide where monsters live to get stat and skill bonuses. \n Enjoy the Showmance - Take the cast members on outlandish dates, massage your sweetheart to unlock more conversation options, and spend time getting to know these supernatural hotties.\nFight or flirt with the Van Helsings?\nYou play as the legendary playboy vampire himself, Drac, as he battles and romances his way across Transylvania. After being reluctantly recruited by the Grim Reaper to star in a \u201creality dating show,\u201d he's on a mission to find the world's most eligible monsters, get them to move into his party mansion, and restore his former glory by killing everything in his path along the way.\nThings are about to get...spicy.\n ANNOUNCING: Limited Run physical copies!\nLike top-shelf physical copies? The mighty Gods at Limited Run have you covered!\nIt wouldn't be a reality show without DRAMAAAAAA! And our diverse cast brings the goods. Inspired by everything from mythology, classic Universal monsters, to...Jersey Shore? Here are some of the wild monsters Drac will need to wine and dine.\nOh, you think that's all? Oh no, no, no. We have lots more over-the-top reality show monsters in store for you. Stay tuned as we reveal more characters!\n\nUpdate! Introducing...Frank(enstein)\nEnemy turned cast member (and potential love interest!). Be careful though...he's a monster before he's had his coffee.\nWhat's a reality show without trouble? Clawdia, the show's werecheetah is a vortex of disorder. Like most cats.\nWhen the Grim Reaper notices his best client, Drac, has lost his bloodlust for the afterlife, he sets Drac up with a reality TV show to try to get his groove back. Drac must now traverse the perilous countryside of Transylvania on a hunt for the world\u2019s most eligible monsters. Once he has wooed them, they\u2019ll move back into his party mansion, where their rowdy exploits will be documented by the camera crew. Will Drac find \u201cLove at first Bite\u201d, or will he discover \u201cLove Sucks\u201d?\n\u201cTerrorizing the townsfolk just wasn\u2019t fun anymore. Then Grim suggested putting the \u2018lust\u2019 back in bloodlust and I thought, you know what, he\u2019s right.\u201d\nIt should go without saying that Drac and Grim's relationship is...complicated. They're long-time (eons) bffs, but they also are, how shall we say, business associates. Drac brings Grim a lot of \"business.\" And when Grim notices Drac is not producing the same numbers he used to, well, it was time for drastic measures.\nThe thirst is strong with this one.\nGrim offers to rebuild Drac's castle. When Drac appeases the mad creator with over-the-top combat and scintillating romance, Grim adds more rooms! As cast members move in, Drac can furnish their rooms to keep them happy and receive benefits, based on where the characters are slotted. You may feel a special connection to Ilessa, but really enjoy peppering enemies with Rat Darts, a Trick that Eden teaches you. You'll have to weigh growing your relationship vs your powers. Decisions, decisions!\nGothic castle or party mansion? Why not both? Choose carefully where you slot cast members.\nRomancelvania includes a number of diverse lands to explore. From a desert made entirely of desserts like churro cacti, to the All Seeing Swamp where you can\u2019t escape from the watchful eyes of Grim and his lackeys. \nWe\u2019re taking the combat and exploration of Metroidvanias and pairing them with the most appealing aspects of dating games. This allows us to merge the excitement of action platformers with meaningful narrative, taking both genres to new heights! Also, our \"hub world\" of the mansion allows players to choose their playstyle - if you prefer more dating, spend more time in the mansion and have every conversation possible! If you'd rather get back to the action, use the hubworld sparingly and just grab quests and essentials there. We want to give the player choices in how they interact with Romancelvania's world!\nLet's dig into some of the specifics.\nDrac's signature weapon, The Impaler, in action! Here, Drac fights a pair of \"Screaming Jellyfish\" on a giant set Grim built. Grim goes to ridiculous lengths to bring a bit of flair to the combat and platforming.\nWhip it good!\nDrac\u2019s signature weapon is \u201cThe Impaler,\u201d a devastating long spear. He's grown quite accustomed to it over the centuries...to the point where Grim needs to offer a way to \"mate\" Drac's precious Impaler with other weapons Drac finds on his adventure. \nDrac simply needs to place the Impaler alongside the newly found weapon in the Weapon Motel, toss in a few crystals and voila...out pops in a new weapon born of the Impaler bloodline. Each new combination of weapon and crystal yields an exciting new tool!\nRomancelvania\u2019s upgrade system is a bit like the Horadric Cube in Diablo 2, or cooking in Breath of the Wild.\nDrop in a weapon, toss in some crystals and \u201cmate\u201d your weapons.\nMate your weapons to take your combat to new heights!\nBy adding crystals into the slots in The Weapon Motel, players can imbue a new weapon with different traits, elemental effects, and other surprises.\nGrim is after ratings. And there's no better way to win over the crowd than a flashy coup de gr\u00e2ce. You better bring your fighting game skills though - these attacks are performed by a special combination of key presses. \n\nTricks are items that assist in combat by allowing for different attack patterns. They are meant to add spice and supplement weapon combat.\nSo long Big Chungus!\nBut with all this slaying, Drac's gotta find time to unwind...and get to know the cast so he can find the love of his afterlife! Romancelvania has a number of ways you can get close.\nWhisk your castmates on extravagant dates around the world, or select the one who's stolen your cold, lifeless heart and profess your love on a special custom outing. \nWe have a saying on the team \"naughty not dirty.\" This is about building relationships. Even though we also \"slay and lay\" the game is much more about building tension and not about graphic nudity.\nYou are my wish.\nWe have numerous opportunities for conversation with each cast member, and you can get to discover what makes them tick. \nSparks fly when Drac discovers his ex is one of the contestants.\nRomancelvania thinks the key to your heart can be picked like a lock, so introducing: the Massage minigame. Is a character tense? Are they holding back? Offer a massage! If they accept, you can unlock new conversation and date options!\nBecome the master of unknotting!\n\n\nGigantic, over-the-top bosses are an integral part of Metroidvanias. They fit naturally in the reality TV show setting as obstacles Grim puts in front of Drac to help get higher ratings and excitement from the audience.\nHere are a few of our boss fights:\nLulu Cthulhu\n\nGiant Spaghetti Monster\nWhat evil lurks at Grim's new favorite restaurant, the Meatball Garden?\nMiddle-aged Mutant Ninja Cerberus\nTime to pull out the Rat Darts\nThe show has many production assistants. There are human sycophant \"bloodbags\" who volunteer their time (and well-being) for the good of the show. And perhaps most importantly of all, Battaboom - Drac's own personal assistant!  He will help you out in combat with a variety of ways, including serving as a pack mule and delivering Drac blood when he needs it most!\n Edit: Female Drac is no longer a stretch goal - but a reality! :) \nMore to unlock as we go!\nWe've got some REWARDS, fam!

While our team has made games before (BioShock, BioShock Infinite, Saints Row, Perception, etc), we haven't made one during a worldwide pandemic. \n\nBut we have worked remotely. We made Perception from our basement. Time and again, we've been faced with unusual circumstances, and we've made better games for it. We believe Romancelvania will be one of these games to overcome the trying times and make something that will bring people joy.\n\nThis motivation, above all others, is what drives us.\n\nIn terms of timing: we are targeting late 2021. However, we are putting in March 2022 because we realize that development is unpredictable. It all depends on our funding amount - the more stretch goals we hit, the better. Ultimately, it is far more important to deliver a game that meets the expectations of our fans than to hit a date. We have already built a significant portion of the game, but we do have a lot of work to do. We have also spent years building up an incredible network of hugely talented individuals and companies who are chomping at the bit to help out more on the project. In short, every bit of additional funding goes toward adding more to the game. We have huge plans for Romancelvania and hope to build a world we can continue to expand upon in the future. \n \nWe have carefully budgeted and planned this project and we pride ourselves on being brutally honest with ourselves. We will be working extremely hard to meet your expectations and we will keep you informed along the way.

It\u2019s also our dream game and would be more than pleased to deliver it to you! We, as monster taming genre fans, want to make something unique and never seen before. Take a look at Anitons early gameplay footage:\nAnitons is an open world monster-collecting RPG where you start your adventure in the wilderness, fight wild Anitons, and collect your own unique Anitons. Every Aniton you obtain can help you fight and farm. Expand your base to fit all monsters in your collection - decorate walls and place bamboo sticks to make Pangeros feel at home. Happy and well-fed Aniton will fight better and help you gather resources. Catch every known Aniton, battle other players, build the biggest farm or just get lost in a world full of life!\nFeatures:\nExplore a vast open-world where you can find wild Anitons and useful resources. At first, getting by in the wilderness will not be an easy task, but as you collect and evolve more powerful Anitons, you will find a way to be invincible.\nControl your Anitons in real-time combat and use the various skills you've taught them. During a fight, it is not only the strategy that plays a role but also agility and accuracy.  Fighting with wild Anitons won\u2019t always be a fair fight, prepare to face dozens of enemies at once!\n\nEvolve various Anitons, acquire new moves, or breed a completely new one. To do this you will need DNA points. You can obtain these by either farming this specific type of Aniton, or by fighting them in the wild. Forge your own path!\nInvite multiple friends and play together. You can team up to fight Aniton Hordes on Raids, or build a new base with your friends. Use PvP duels to fight other players and test new tactics. Offline mode will of course still be an option for those who want to play solo.  Note: this feature is linked to the \u201cMultiplayer\u201d stretch goal.\nFound your own base using resources you obtain from the wild. There, you can keep all of your Anitons and make them feel at home. You can not only place buildings but also customize the environment around you! Create a cozy place for you and your Anitons to rest after a tough fight.\n\nFarm various monsters and resources that you will find useful throughout your journey. Each type of Aniton prefers a different kind of food. Well-fed Aniton will use his unique ability that will aid you in this aspect! Electric types can charge machines that will automate your work, fire types can heat your house, and water types can help grow your crops.\nCustomize your character to perfectly fit your playstyle and Aniton squad. Unlock new outfits as you progress by completing various challenges. You can also build your mansion, paint walls, and hang pictures of your friends and favorite Anitons!\nSince the beginning of the development, we\u2019ve been transparent with our goals and development process and we\u2019ll keep on doing this until the full release. We organized a couple of contests where fans could create their own Anitons or name existing ones. If you want to shape the final look of the Anitons, join our discord here:  >>>CLICK<<<\nSTORY\nThe world of Anitons is divided into smaller areas that are habited by different kinds of monsters. On the volcanic grounds, you can find various fire type Anitons, and if you are looking for crystal types, you should visit the underground, monster-infested caves. As the player, you can freely explore this open-world continent and return to your base at any time.\n\nThere are 9 different types of Anitons. Each type has its own unique playstyle and skillset. You can choose Nature for its ability to heal or stick with Rock for its defensive skills. If on the other hand, you\u2019re going to fight a whole bunch of enemies at once, Fire, with its area effect skills might just be perfect for you. If you\u2019re playing with a friend, choose a combination that will increase your damage output like Water and Electric. The dual-typed Anitons only multiply already almost endless possibilities. Find your playstyle!\nYou start out by visiting your Uncle that lives overseas, in search of a job. You decide to help him finish his project of a lifetime - gather information about every existing Aniton. Little you know how this goal will change your life. Not only you have to build your own base, but also collect every Aniton out there. Even with the help of your friends... This might take a while.\nEnough about the task, which one of these little fellas would you choose?\nAnitons are the creatures living in the wild or with humans. You can create your own Anitons that will happily help you with fighting, or farming. All of your monster friends have to live somewhere, a cozy farm is perfect for them. Every Aniton loves to play, and have his favorite food that the owner must provide. With time your monsters will get experienced and will evolve into more powerful forms. During your adventure, you will meet and collect tons of them.\nWhile going into the wild you can take up to 6 Anitons with you. They will help you travel, gather resources, and fight. If any of your monsters faint during the battle, you will have to take care of him after returning to your farm. Each Anioton can learn skills as they evolve, and the last stage can master up to 3 different abilities. While fighting the player takes control of the monster, to win he will have to use both accuracy and a tactic.\nThe Stegra line is the most popular three-stage evolution. You can evolve your Aniton to more powerful forms and with each evolution, it can learn new skills. Since this specific line is a mix of Rock and Nature type, while choosing a new ability for your monster you can either pick supportive Nature abilities or go with defensive Rock skills.\nThe Tadapas line is composed of toxic type Anitons. In the first stage Tadapas has an additional water typing that the next stage evolution is missing. This means that your Tadapas can have a water ability, but since first form ability is known from the beginning, you'll have to create a Tapadas with the exact skill that you are looking for. Using more DNA you can boost your chances to get better Anitons in creation process.\nThe Ottim line is different from most of the other Aniton lines. After getting enough experience to evolve, you can choose its new stage. Since Ottim's passive ability is to find random crystals, the evolution you choose will additionally influence its skill. Fishtter is a more defense-oriented evolution that will find blue crystals for you, whilst Sharker is a more offensive form that will find mostly red crystals.\n\nTo gather funding for the Anitons project we've prepared unique rewards for you to choose from. Hope you will find something just perfect for you. All gathered funds will be used for the development of the game.\n\n\n\n\nDuring the development of our previous game, we decided that we want to become independent in terms of the production of our next title. This will provide a way to make Anitons with our community and by this, make Anitons a game of your dreams too. Success in Kickstarter will help us stay indie and provide a way to keep on developing this game. At this point in time, we cannot say if we\u2019ll be able to develop Anitons if we won\u2019t hit our initial $75k stretch goal, but with fans as you, this shouldn\u2019t be our concern.\nWe\u2019ve been working for almost one year to create a sharp vision of Anitons that you can see today, and we reach a point when we have to start full production. If you become a backer and trust us, this game will become yours and we\u2019ll be excited to develop it for you. Your feedback along the way will ensure that we\u2019re moving in the right direction. Let\u2019s set out on this adventure together!\nMeet the team behind Anitons! Our core team has been working together for the past 3 years on our previous game, Lumberhill, and since the beginning, in January we welcomed a couple of new team members. All of us are thrilled to work on this game, and right now we can\u2019t wait to start full production. If Kickstarter will be successful, we have a plan to extend our team with talented artists to bring your game to an even higher level.\nBelow you can find our sketch of the Anitons project roadmap. The plan below includes working on all of the stretch goals we've prepared, so the final release date won't surprise us if we do hit those later stretch goals.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our first Kickstarter campaign, but it\u2019s not our first project. We\u2019ve been working in a team for over three years now. Even considering Anitons is our biggest production to date, we\u2019re prepared in terms of the technology and skills required to finish this project. At this point in time, we have been developing Anitons for almost a year.\n\nWe have used all of our experience in planning development and the budget for Anitons. Quality and deadlines are the most fundamental aspects of our work since our team is working in Agile. Quality is not only graphic that can be measured, but also gameplay and player experience. Having this in mind, we\u2019re prepared to sacrifice minor graphical content if this can help shape Anitons into a game you will enjoy for many hours.\n\nSince the beginning of the development, we\u2019ve been transparent with our goals and development process and we\u2019ll keep on doing this until the full release. As a backer, you've helped us a lot already, but there\u2019ll be many more occasions where you can shape the final look of the Anitons. At this point in time we cannot say if we\u2019ll be able to develop Anitons if we won\u2019t hit our initial $75k stretch goal, but with fans as you this shouldn\u2019t be our concern.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nReusability and recyclability\nIn our project we don't use papper and plastic.

Note that this will NOT affect us providing customs-friendly shipping to our backers.\nPlease note that shipping is also notoriously unreliable in some regions such as Russia and Brazil.

The game aims to deliver many features that will help it differ from your typical horror game, with things such as:\n\n Beautiful hand-drawn 8-bit pixel art\n   Explore a changing Mansion and journey between the mortal and demon realms\n   A fantastic 1980s synthwave soundtrack written just for Sunshine Manor\n   Power-ups and Costumes to help you in your quest\n   Cross paths with a host of unique characters\n   With a bit of comedy in there as well!\n  First and foremost, Ada isn\u2019t your typical 1980s horror movie damsel in distress. Although she might be trapped inside the Sunshine Manor, Ada is more than capable at stopping the unfolding nightmare and ending the Shadow Man\u2019s reign of terror over the ghostly inhabitants of the old Aitken House.\nAda doesn\u2019t have just her wits to protect her though. Her latent psychic powers are triggered as she enters the Mansion, allowing her to vanquish demons, ward off the Shadow Man and solve devious puzzles that would trap any normal human.\nHowever, with every reward there is also a great risk at hand. The range of your psychic abilities is a bit short, so you have to get close to vanquish these evil rascals and force the Shadow Man back into his lair. Miss, and you\u2019re in a world of trouble\u2026\nThe old Aitken House has sat abandoned for the past four years. The local children have told stories of the gruesome murders that happened there all those years ago. Ada and her two friends pluck up the courage to knock on the door\u2026 the rest is for you to discover!\nWhilst this is a game set entirely within a single location, the mansion itself changes over time, with new areas unlocking during your quest to stop the Shadow Man. You\u2019ll find items, keys, costumes, hidden rooms and more, all within the beautiful hand-drawn rooms and corridors you\u2019ll explore.\nNot content with just the mortal realm? Well, you will also be able to make your way through the Demon Realm and its roster of baddies. Some are out for blood, while others are \u2013 somehow - a little bit more relaxed. To give you an idea of what to expect, here\u2019s a rundown of some of these creatures.\nBack in 2015 when we were hard at work on building up Camp Sunshine, we wanted to include a whole host of costumes and power-ups within the game that players could unlock as they progressed. However, as the game\u2019s development continued, we realized doing that would take away from the type of game we were trying to create\u2026 One built on the premise that you were constantly hunted down, unable to fight.\nWith Sunshine Manor, and the introduction of Ada\u2019s rather awesome psychic powers, it\u2019s the perfect time to give you a whole host of weird and wonderful looks and new powers you can unlock as the story unfolds.\nWant to wield the power of purple plasma? Then the Plasmancer costume is going to be perfect for you! Just make sure you keep them safely stored away when you\u2019re not using them since, if you\u2019re not careful, they could be lost forever!\nWe're happy to announce that we'll be partnering with Premium Edition Games to give backers the chance to pledge for a Premium Edition physical Nintendo Switch cartridge that will include not only Sunshine Manor but also Camp Sunshine too! \nThis version will include a Kickstater Exclusive Cover, a Kickstarter Exclusive Slipcover, a Full Color Manual, and a Kickstater Exclusive Trading Car\nBut wait... there's more! On top of this, Premium Edition Games will also be working on a Kickstarter Exclusive Sunshine Edition that will include everything from the Premium Edition described above, alongside the soundtrack for Sunshine Manor on an Old-School Cassette Tape, a pair of gnarly Sunshine Manor Sweatbands, a full color printed guide, and the Kickstarter Exclusive Premium Edition Trading Card will be signed by Fossil Games! Oh, and it will all be housed inside of a VHS Clamshell Box, for that old-school 1980s look and feel!\nIn 2016 we released what we thought would be a small game called Camp Sunshine, which went on to be featured by prominent YouTubers across the world. In Camp Sunshine you played as Jez, an unarmed teenager, who was being stalked by a deranged mascot in a bear costume brandishing a rather larger knife. \nWe\u2019re delighted to let everyone know that backing this Kickstarter project not only gets you a copy of Sunshine Manor, but also a copy of Camp Sunshine! \nDepending on which tier you back, you could get the games on Steam, or get digital console copies of each one! \nOn top of this, you can also pledge for the physical Nintendo Switch copy of the Sunshine Anthology, which features Sunshine Manor and Camp Sunshine on a Nintendo Switch cartridge! How awesome is that!?\nPLAY\n\nWith a game based heavily on our love of 1980s horror movies, we had to create a score in the vein of John Carpenter, Tangerine Dream and Angelo Badalamenti. Want to take a listen to some of the tracks?\n\n\n\nSince Premium Edition will not be shipping backers their physical Premium Edition Nintendo Switch copy - or their Sunshine Edition! - until 2021 (once Sunshine Manor's development has been completed and the game has a digital release date), shipping costs will be charged to backers next year. \nShipping will be charged after this Kickstarter finishes and this will be based on actual costs incurred to ship and is collected via our pledge manager system. This allows us to charge fairly for all backers and avoid a \"one size fits all\" mentality to shipping. \n\nWe are working directly with Premium Edition Games and will be using their fulfilment centers and partners to ensure that your order ships quickly and the DDP is included so that you can get your physical rewards without any extra hassles!\nLimited Edition Cover by Graham Humphreys!\nGraham Humphreys is a British illustrator and visual artist best known for producing classic movie posters. During the 1980s, Graham worked alongside Palace Pictures producing posters and more for movies including Basket Case, The Evil Dead and Nightmare on Elm Street too!\nAs you might have already guessed, Sunshine Manor (and Camp Sunshine!) are huge homages to 1980s horror movies, which made Graham a big name on our dream wishlist to have as the designer for our game's cover art, so we really couldn\u2019t be happier!\nBefore we forget, we're here to report that there's certainly a dog in Sunshine Manor. As you can see below, you can interact with said dog, and that means that, yes, you can pet the dog in Sunshine Manor! \nSo ... meet Gnarlie!\nGnarlie is also pretty intelligent (if we do say so ourselves) as he knows to keep out of the way of things that might be important in the Manor!\nWe are Paul and Josh, two old farts based in the UK and the US who began creating games over our shared love of retro gaming, pixel art with outlines, and 1980s horror movies. Back in 2016 we released the cult hit Camp Sunshine and we were thrilled when it gathered a hugely positive reaction on Steam!\nBoth of us make these games as a side project as we just love creating retro styled games dripping in horror. The success of this Kickstarter project would allow us to take a year off from our jobs to concentrate on developing Sunshine Manor full-time!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have the development experience needed to make Sunshine Manor thanks to our work on Camp Sunshine.\n\nWith your support, we'll be able to dedicate our time in full to completing Camp Sunshine for a Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, XBO, and PC release in 2021.\n\nIf, for some reason, the game's development is delayed, we'll be sure to let you, our backers, know right away. Rest assured that any potential delay will only exist if we believe that an extra bit of time polishing the game is needed so that you can have the best digital - and physical - game we can give you!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a312 or more", "title": "Come and Play", "descp": "Windows Steam copies of Camp Sunshine and Sunshine Manor + Come and Play In-Game Credit for Sunshine Manor + Special Discord Channel Role\nINCLUDES:\nWindows Steam Copy of Camp Sunshine\nWindows Steam Copy of Sunshine Manor\nCome and Play In-Game Credit\nSpecial Discord Channel Role", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2021"}], "stat": ["37 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a322 or more", "title": "Wanna Play a Game", "descp": "All of the above (Except for Crazy Early Bird and Early Bird tiers) + Digital Console Copy of Camp Sunshine (Nintendo Switch, PS4 or XBO) + Digital Console Copy of Sunshine Manor (Nintendo Switch, PS4 or XBO) + Digital Deluxe Edition (Digital Soundtracks for Camp Sunshine and Sunshine Manor + PDF Guide from Premium Edition) + Wanna Play a Game In-Game Credit for Sunshine Manor\nINCLUDES:\nWindows Steam Copy of Camp Sunshine\nWindows Steam Copy of Sunshine Manor\nDigital Console Copy of Camp Sunshine (Switch, PS4 or XBO)\nDigital Console Copy of Sunshine Manor (Switch, PS4 or XBO)\nDigital Soundtrack for Camp Sunshine\nDigital Soundtrack for Sunshine Manor\nPDF Guide from Premium Edition\nWanna Play a Game In-Game Credit\nSpecial Discord Channel Role", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2021"}], "stat": ["45 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a345 or more", "title": "It\u2019s Alive!

After 10 years in the industry, David and Ellie started this studio in 2015 and released Timing Hero and Super Pixel Racers. We are experienced and skilled, we put the fun and productivity first. We make our best games to give inspiration to players :)\n\nChrono Sword is a very epic game, and we have many literary, artistic, musical, and technical challenges for this work. Our goal is to complete Chrono Sword as the best game and deliver it to gamers. This requires the attention, feedback, and support of many people, and of course financial stability. We're doing a lot inside the studio, but in order to bring the game into a higher quality, we need many help like translation, cut-scene animations, voice-over, and sound effects. We hope to meet many fans who can support and give feedback, supporters who can help our development, and relationships that we haven't thought of through Kickstarter.\n\n\n\n- Once you choose a physical pledge, it will be based on \"Avatar tier\" not \"Aenor tier\".\n- Once you choose a pledge with physical OST, you will get CD and plus LP.\nSince Kickstarter does not allow to edit the pledges after live, you may find different description between this page and the pledge list. You will get better one among them in that case. Sorry for giving you confusing.\n\n(These are just sample to help you.

With their help we can make sure that the studio will be sustainable and launch the project at it's absolute peak. On top of this with their second service \"gameround.co\" we'll be able to directly test and get feedback from thousands of gamers ensuring that we are developing the project to the right factor. This significantly minimizes all risks with our company, giving us an edge over other game development companies. \n\nWe believe that games can inspire and touch gamers, developers and others. To this end, we are making our best games, including many literary, artistic, musical and technical challenges. These challenges require new solutions, a lot of trial and error. A lot of time has been spent on improving game engines and development environments for this, not developing content. In addition, countless synopsis improvements were needed for a high-quality game experience.\n\nFor this reason, we couldn't release new contents and news, and communication with fans has decreased. Today, these R&Ds are almost over, and synopsis and scripts are completed, we are moving on to production.\n\nAnother risk is how long it will take to bring the experience of new content to the level we want, but we believe that we can solve it through a lot of development experience, and communication with you guys.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "Follower", "descp": "You are not sure yet that you want Chrono Sword, but still rooting for us.

Both of our previous games were successfully developed and released with the help of Kickstarter backers like you, and we couldn\u2019t be more excited to tell you about our new project: The Wandering Village!\n\nThe Wandering Village is a city building simulation game. In a world where mysterious plants are spreading all over the earth, emitting toxic spores as they grow, a group of people seeks shelter on the back of a giant, wandering creature they call \u2018Onbu\u2019.\nBecome their leader, build their settlement and form a symbiotic relationship with the creature to survive together in this hostile, yet beautiful post-apocalyptic world that now surrounds you.\nKey Features\nBuild a village on the back of a giant creature\nFarm various crops\nSend out foraging missions to gather rare resources\nSurvive a variety of different biomes and events\nBuild a relationship with a giant and influence its actions\nEcology/Biology inspired gameplay\nUnique blend of 3D and hand-drawn, hand-animated 2D graphics    \n\nAt its core, The Wandering Village is a city building and resource management game with rogue-like and survival elements. Farm various crops to keep your villagers fed, send out foraging missions to gather rare resources and scout the environment while constantly expanding the settlement. Of course, living on the back of a living, breathing beast comes with its own challenges, such as helping to maintain the creature\u2019s health and building trust. This might even lead to the beast paying attention to your requests as it wanders through a variety of different biomes, each with its own perks and challenges, always trying to outrun the threat of the toxic spores.\nIn-game Screenshot\nThe ultimate goal, for both the humans and the creature, is to find a place where they can settle down and live in peace again. And if they don\u2019t find this place, maybe they can figure out a way to fight back the plants and create it themselves.\n\nCore Mechanics\nSurvival - Escape from the toxic spores and keep your villagers and the creature alive against ever-changing threats.\nSymbiosis - Live both from and in harmony with the giant creature and form a relationship with it as you trek together through the post-apocalyptic world.\nBuilding - Build an infrastructure where your people can live together, work together and survive together.\nFarming - Plant, cultivate and harvest various crops to keep your villagers and the creature fed and healthy, or grow new kinds of resources.\nForaging - Send scouting parties to explore the different biomes surrounding you, discover rare resources and bring them back to your village, opening up new possibilities.\nHelp us grow our community and get noticed on Steam by wishlisting the game and following us on social media. We now reached 20'000 wishlists! An additional skin for Onbu, the giant creature, will be unlocked for everyone.\nAfter we came up with the concept for the game, we first started thinking about the general look and feel of the game\u2019s world and how it would affect gameplay. We quickly settled on a blend of painted 2D backgrounds and static assets and hand-animated 2D characters in a 3D world, since it combined the strengths of our team members, was easy to navigate in-game and just looked really charming in our opinion.\nInitial world sketch.\n\nThe creature, \u2018Onbu\u2019, was probably the most important part of the process as it is both the map where the game takes place and a character in itself. We started with concepts that were pretty close to existing animals, but moved away from this approach over time as we wanted something that you could more sensibly build a village on. Thus, the designs slowly but surely evolved into our very own earthen fantasy creature, the \u2018Onbu\u2019.\nConcept art of Onbu.\nProcess sketches of Onbu.\n\nOnbu wanders through a post-apocalyptic world, which was the next part of our art-design process. We wanted this world to be a stark contrast to Onbu to emphasize that it is toxic, wild and uninhabitable. Onbu on the other hand should feel like an island, an oasis, the only thing that makes survival possible for the humans building the settlement on its back.\nConcept art of the world.\nVarious sketches of the world.\n\nSpeaking of the humans, the first step in designing them was figuring out their scale, not only to make sense gameplay-wise, but also to be visible enough at any zoom level. As for the design itself, our goal was to make them look friendly, maybe even cute, but also to have them reflect that the world they live in is a dangerous one, which is why we gave them protective clothing.\nVillagers as they appear in-game.\nProcess sketches.\n\nNext were the buildings, which had to look functional while conveying both the original culture of the villagers and their adaptations to living in their new environment. They are constructed from simple materials, and since Onbu\u2019s back is so high up and winds are strong, many of them are powered by wind energy. Colorful flags can often be seen attached to them as they are used to communicate with other villagers.\nConcept art of farming buildings.\nProcess sketches of various buildings.\n\nVarious other species besides humans have survived the apocalypse. Most of these creatures are a mix between something familiar, like mammals, and something that seems alien, like giant insects. With this approach, we hope to achieve a result somewhere in the middle, ideally something that is weird, but kinda cute.\nFirst sketches of other creatures.\nInspiration\nOur main inspirations for the game were the evocative drawings of french artist Moebius and the works of Studio Ghibli, specifically Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind and Princess Mononoke.\n\nThe World\nMysterious plants are spreading all over the world, turning the ground toxic and infertile and the air unbreathable. No one knows what caused this, but the source has to be somewhere out there, waiting to be discovered.\nThe Human Settlers\nIncreasingly polluted air and failing harvests caused by the spores have driven the humans from their village. Many have died from hunger and exposure until they crossed paths with the giant creature. The remaining few managed to climb onto its back and start a new settlement.\nIn order to sustain themselves, adapt to their environment and grow stronger and smarter, they\u2019ll need to harvest materials from the creatures\u2019 body and its surroundings, while also making sure that the creature itself survives and keeps on walking, away from the spores and, hopefully, towards a safer place.\nThe village on the back of the giant creature.\n\nThe Gigantic Creature, \u201cOnbu\u201d\nOnbu is the name given to the creature by the villagers.\n   Before the toxic spores started spreading, it was sleeping for hundreds of years, buried in the ground, looking like a mere hill. But when the soil around it became toxic, it awoke from its long slumber and started to walk, trying to find a safe spot where it can go to rest again.\n   But it is neither used nor adapted to travelling long distances, having gotten its nutrients from the ground for such a long time.\n\n   At first, it doesn\u2019t even notice the small creatures crawling around on its back.

One would instantly notice the odd helmet Ed adorned. When Edward was a child, he had a rare degenerative lung disease. His Mother being the brilliant scientist she was created a headpiece and sleeping pod that help regulate the pressure in Ed's body. Ever since then, Edward has worn the helmet and slept in the pod, understanding that if he spends too much time apart from them, the separation will end in his demise.\n\nWhat is Space Station 52?\n      Space Station 52 was once a hot spot and a prominent tourist destination. The on-station lake stalked with some of the universe's most delicious seafood helped supply the local 5-Star restaurants. The Grand Millenium Hotel housed some of histories biggest stars and politicians. It's was a place to relax and enjoy some of the most luxurious things in life. Now it's little less than a chapter in the history books. Malnourished and crumbling, with many residents having moved on, the Space Station is nearing its finish.\n\nFeatured & Planned Locations:\nForbidden Island\nAbandoned Lighthouse\nAlien Fisherman's Wharf\nLake filled with strange creatures\nDerelict Museum\nOpulent Hotel\nSeedy Tavern\nForgotten Alleys\nSci-fi Corridors\nand even Space itself.\nStory Intro:\n     As Ed arrives at the Space Station, what he finds is a decaying beauty. He begins to interact with those odd few left on the station and discovers a melancholy and strangeness that seems to of tainted nearly everyone there.  No time is wasted putting him to task though, barely even having time to gather his things for his new living quarters, his sent on his way.\n     While investigating a malfunctioning moisture recycler, Edward starts to have visions of things that simply can't be. Brushing it off as some version of jetlag, he presses on. As to the mystery of the broken recycler, his first clue is a pool of blood, his second, the mangled remains of the engineer he was sent to replace, logged in the machine. Perhaps overwhelmed by the sight of the body, Ed stumbles back, his mind rambling with visions. An encroaching blackness overcomes him, grasping for sanity, Ed falls to the ground.    \n\n                    Darkness.\n\n                   A pinhole of light interrupts the void.\n\n                   The brilliant light grows.\n\n                   Brighter.\n\n                   Brighter.\n\n                         Rudely welcomed by the fluorescent bulbs of the doctor's office, Edward is jolted awake.

Will you cast aside your ethics for a quick buck, or will you take the high road and find a way to scrape by honestly? \nPlatforms\nWe need your help to bring Dirty Land to Windows, OSX, and Linux.\nAfterwards, we'd love to bring you this game to Nintendo Switch, to mobile devices, and to consoles like XBox and PlayStation; and we will if we can meet our funding goal, so let us know if you you'd like to see stretch goals for your favorite platform!\nSomething New Every Day \nInteresting events await outside of the strip mall\nWelcome to your new job. At the start of every day, you begin out front of this unassuming, drab strip mall, where Pure Sky Properties is tucked away. Every day brings new characters to meet, new events to experience, and new stories to be told. What will it be tomorrow?\nChoose a Lead, Go on a Sit, and Close 'em!\nTwo leads per day, choose wisely!\nThese are the new leads. You'll probably close one of your leads today, but can you close two leads a day? You're gonna need some caffeine for that. But you know what salesmen say about coffee... you better prove your worth if you want that cup of joe!\nEvery day you'll have chances to make a sale. Learn what they like, study their habits, memorize what you can about them, and get them to sign on the line which is dotted!\nThe Birth of a Salesman\nThe Story of Willy Loman... err... Frank Marsh\nYou are Frank Marsh. You've made a mistake that has ruined your family. You can't change your past, but you can change your future! \nWill you take the high road and stick to your principles, or take the low road and chase the easy money? Whichever path you take, you'll discover multiple endings based on the choices you've made and whether you succeed or fail in those choices.\nOn top of those choices, you'll need to balance your family life with your work life. Will you be a model father and go home and play with your kids? Or will you go out on another sit and close that elusive buyer? Go too far down one path and there will be consequences... your choice will change Frank's story - at work and at home.\nMake Friends First, Sales Second\nAn office is a place where dreams come true. A place to meet lively new people. A sociopathic manager. An elusive owner. An opportunistic coworker out to steal your money. A flamboyant salesman with no concept of failure. A seductive hairdresser. An intrepid drycleaner. A neglected wife. A pair of dumb mob thugs. A ripped-off customer. A brutal detective. A homeless derelict with clues to a mystery. A rival firm across the street. And many more... \nOffice manager Chet, possibly the most insane boss you'll ever have\nThis quirky drycleaner has some clues for you...\nGrab a haircut and hear some gossip!\nEarl will lend you money when you need it, but at a price...\nDon't neglect your family!\nBe Closing, Always\nThe money is out there. All you gotta do is reach out and grab it! How many leads can you pitch and sell? Can you bag the top leads? Will you take advantage of easy prey, or tackle deals with honor?\nJust a sampling of leads you'll try and close\nPlay the Sleuth\nDo I have your attention? Good. Because it's not just sales numbers that you need to keep your eye on.  You need to keep your wits about you, because in an office full of backstabbers, anything can and will happen. Including the surreal!\nWhat a nice gesture from your boss!\nWho killed Frank Junior?\nClearly you've been framed. But by who?\nSolve Murder Mysteries\nIn a desperate world you'll meet desperate people. Dangerous people. People who will do anything to make rent. To not get fired. To make that promotion. To secure those juicy leads. From unsavory characters to hilarious charmers, they all have secret motives to uncover... you'll need to gather clues and piece together the truth to gain the upper hand in this double-crossing world! \nSuspects include: everyone\nNothing is as it seems in the dangerous world of real estate\nEveryone is a suspect! Especially you! \nAnd this murder won't be the only one...\nRewards\nBeyond the game itself, we're offering additional reward tiers:\nCoffee Mug\nShow everyone you're a closer with a signature Pure Sky Properties coffee mug.   \nLimited Edition Coffee Mug. We want one too!\nBecome a Lead\nHave your name in the game as one of the leads that Frank may encounter during his sales journey. So let me ask you this question: can you sell yourself?\nAll the salesmen are waiting for this new lead!\nNote: we won't allow offensive names or story-breaking content in the game.\nLeading Role\nImmortalize yourself in the game by having your own portrait drawn in loving pixel glory! Not only will you be able to sell yourself in the game (you can send us personality traits to make you tougher to sell), you'll get a digital version to printout too! Ideal for either drivers licenses, passports, or to sit proudly framed on your office desk (your choice).  \nOnce you get your Pixel Portrait it will motivate you to keep your workstation very clean\nNote: all reward images are mockups and may differ from the final version.\nCredits and Acclaim\n\"The atmosphere is great... reinforcing the desperate, melancholy feel of the game. The grimy locations, ugly characters, and downbeat, jazzy soundtrack are reminiscent of a very particular kind of '90s movie, which is an aesthetic I've never seen captured by a videogame before. As for the game itself, my demo wasn't deep enough to say for sure, but I think the developer might be onto something special here. I hope it hits its funding target.\" - Andy Kelly, PC Gamer\n\nWorried if we can do this or not? Here is a sampling of past reviews for Patchman vs Red. Circles, a videogame we made with the help of Kickstarter: \nYes we can!\nBut... why? \nWhy a videogame about real estate sales? Why not a fantasy game about dragons, elves, killing monsters, or World War 2? Well, those games already exist. This doesn't!  So we felt obliged to make it. We want a game chock full of surprise easter eggs from all the classic pop culture sales movies and shows. We want to capture the experience of working in a ridiculous sales office, without the commitment of actually having the job! Get a taste of what it's like, but more importantly, do and say the things you couldn't get away with in real life, like trash-talking your manager and fellow employees.\nDevelopment\nWe're using Godot Engine along with other development tools to build Dirty Land.\nDeveloping the Office Interior\nCoding in GDScript, a Python-like language\nDeveloping Text Cards for our Trailer\nAn animated sprite in the Exterior Mall scene\nWe believe in Open Source, so we're using tools like Godot, Yarn, GIMP, Krita, Ubuntu, Audacity, regexxer, and more. We've also given back to the Godot community in the form of code, in repositories on github, including godot-yarn-importer and godot-calm-button, with more to come. \nWe've been working on Dirty Land for two years in our free time.  Now we need to take it to the next level by finishing and launching so you can live the life of a salesman!\nPeople\nDavid Kerr - Coder, designer, writer, platform support, and more!  A jack-of-all-trades and master-of... how does that saying go?  Well, don't worry about it, because Dave never quits and never stops, gives it his all, and works so hard your back hurts!\nIgor Motuz - Pixel-Artist whose color choices and drawing abilities combined with his dedication and persistence have turned our game from a pile of programmer art into a retro heaven!  We're lucky to have him along for the ride for this episode.  www.igormotuz.com\nBENI.MARU - Musical maestro who crafted the jazzy instrumental for our trailer.

In 2017, we successfully launched No Heroes Here across multiple platforms and we were selected as one of the winners of the PAX10 independent game showcase. Currently, we are working on our third title known as Dandy Ace!\nComing from a variety of backgrounds, the people on our team have in common both their love for video games as well as having strong commitment to designing and developing games that are more than a product, they are games that contribute to the medium, games that make us proud.\nExperienced in designing content for many different genres, many of our teammates are graduates from the famous Vancouver Film School, including one of our founders, with skills we can put to the test in our projects in order to deliver the best of their know-how and talent.\nWe've learned a lot from the development and launch of No Heroes Here and Monica e a Guarda dos Coelhos and it has helped in the development of our third title, Dandy Ace.\nAs with every project, setbacks may occur and we will work hard to prevent and avoid delays or minimize them as much as possible. We don't expect delays with the production of the rewards and physical goods. So far, we are on track and very proud of the goals accomplished!\nWe want to add some extras to the game, and we can only do that with this Kickstarter and its stretch goals. We are 200% committed to the project and have enjoyed the development process as much as we hope you enjoy the game once it is in your hands. We've been working on Dandy Ace by ourselves up until now, fully devoting our time and effort into this project. While a majority of core game concepts we had envisioned for the project have come to fruition, there are still many things we would like to do prior to the full release of the game. This is where we need your help. Crowdfunding provides us with several opportunities to directly reach new players and engage our community, not only through funding but through feedback and ideas as well. We'll be inviting backers to test development builds and communicate with our team leading up to launch.\nThere are two primary things we hope to accomplish with our Kickstarter campaign. First, we would like to avoid possible Early Access and continue to improve and add features within Dandy Ace to confidently launch the title fully across each platform once it is ready. The second goal of the Kickstarter is to bring more awareness to the game and reach new potential players. We've grown an amazing supportive community of players around Dandy Ace's development so far and hope to continue to do so on a larger scale. A Kickstarter campaign also allows for our community and backers to become more involved in the development process leading up to launch while also supporting our efforts directly.\n Dandy Ace is an over the top roguelike experience that follows a fabulous magician seeking to combine and use his magical cards while fighting and looting his way to defeat the Green-Eyed Illusionist, Lele, who has imprisoned him in a cursed mirror.\nPlay as Dandy Ace, the amazing hero, and survive the challenges of the extravagant, lavish and ever changing palace created to defeat him filled with bizarre creatures and outrageous bosses. Find all of the magical cards, gather shards and gold, and get help from his assistants and unconventional allies.\n Dandy Ace will be coming to PC, Playstation, Xbox, and Switch. The initial launch will be for PC with the consoles to follow in the months after.\nStory\nLele, also known as the Green-Eyed Illusionist, always dreamed of becoming the world's greatest magician. However, he was never able to be taken seriously due to his lack of skill and his tacky appearance. At his lowest point, Lele witnessed the rise of a brilliant prodigy magician named Dandy Ace. The conflict between admiration and envy soon became an obsession, as he decided to try to get rid of the talented young magician. Lele exchanged his soul in order to use the spell of the Cursed Mirror to trap Ace inside of it forever.\nInside the Cursed Mirror, Lele became the king. He created a bizarre palace, filled with trials and creatures, with the goal of humiliating Ace. Due to Lele's desire to watch the young magician fail repeatedly, every time Ace is defeated, he is forced back to the beginning. In order to escape and break the curse, Dandy Ace has to use all of his magic cards and incredible performances to defeat the different enemies found within the Cursed Mirror and take down Lele.\nDandy Ace vs Boss Axolangelo, the Master Painter\nTry, die and try again until you beat the Green-Eyed Illusionist with the replayability and adrenaline of a rogue-like but with permanent upgrades that make you stronger as you continue to reach new levels and progress further with each run!\n2D isometric fast-paced action with lots of challenging but fair combat engagements. Battle your way through bizarre creatures and outrageous bosses while building up your own arsenal of magic.\n The Magical Cards \nDandy Ace\u2019s core mechanic revolves around the Magical Cards which act as skills in the game. Players are able to create countless combinations of skills, upgrades, and play styles by combining the different cards they come across on each run.\nEvery Magical Card has a default skill associated with it. These skills can be upgraded further by combining another Magical Card with it. Players can find stronger versions of cards as they progress through the levels and experiment with the different skills. Players are not guaranteed the same cards each run so it will be important to learn them all!\nThe cards fall into 3 main categories: Blue, Pink, and Yellow\nMovement skill cards are divided between two types: Dashes and Blinks.\nThese cards are often divided into Melee and Ranged Skills.\nThese cards have the widest variety of mechanics, from giant barriers & personal shields to giant slow fields!\nDandy Ace\nThe game's protagonist is none other than one of the greatest magicians alive, the dashing Dandy Ace. Ace is a rising star full of confidence and extremely charismatic. Even in defeat, Ace's confidence remains unshaken in his quest to defeat Lele, the Green-Eyed Illusionist, and escape from the cursed mirror.\n Lele, the Green-Eyed Illusionist \nLele is the main antagonist of Dandy Ace. A magician himself, Lele both admires and hates Ace. As his obsession with Ace grew and his own popularity dropped, Lele sold his soul and trapped Ace inside of the Cursed Mirror.\nEnemies\nThe enemies found within the Cursed Mirror are bizarre creations from Lele's imagination with the only purpose of denying Ace's escape. Ace will also run into some of Lele's prestigious palace guests and unique bosses as he progresses through the various stages providing players with more challenging encounters. Here you can find a few of them!\n Bunny Butler & Bunny Jester \nThe Bunny Butler & Bunny Jester are the most common and basic enemies Dandy Ace will encounter. The Bunny Butler is a melee based enemy looking to charge at Ace whereas the Bunny Jester attacks from range.\nCuckoo Nightmare\n The Cuckoo Nightmare is a tankier enemy Ace must face fairly early on with a wide range of attacks for both up close encounters and at range.\nTurrets & Totems\nStationary enemies that fire projectiles towards Dandy Ace. There are several different types of Turrets that Ace will encounter including Homing Turrets, Poison Turrets, and Multi-Shot Turrets.\nSimilar to Turrets, Totems are static enemies. These enemies do not attack Ace though, they provide Auras around them buffing other enemy creatures and creating more unique combat scenarios. These were created by Lele as bizarre furniture items decorating the Cursed Mirror realm.\nOozes\nThese slime-like creatures split off into multiple smaller versions of themselves during combat forcing Ace to deal with multiple Oozes at once when visiting the Garden.\nLady Fan & Lady Hook\nThese are Lele\u2019s palace guests and some of the strongest enemies encountered in the Cursed Mirror. Lady Fan is the first humanoid enemy Ace comes across and she isn't to be underestimated. Lady Hook is a more challenging version of this enemy and another humanoid that is able to use her hook projectile to pull Ace.\nBosses\nBesides Lele, there are several different complex bosses Ace will need to defeat to escape the Cursed Mirror. Each boss has unique mechanics that will test Dandy Ace and prepare him for the fight against Lele, The Green-Eyed Illusionist!\nAxolangelo, The Master of Arts\nThe Art Gallery is where Axolangelo resides alongside all of his paintings. The name Axolangelo was due to an internal pun/joke within the development team that came from combining the animal axolotl and the famous painter Michelangelo. This is one of the first major challenges and bosses Ace will encounter in the Palace. Players can attempt to take him on in our free demo available now on the Dandy Ace Steam page!\nAllies\nDandy Ace was not the only one to be trapped in the Cursed Mirror by Lele. Ace will need the help of his stage assistants and some of the other characters he meets along the way to escape.\nJolly Jolly & Jenny Jenny\nAce\u2019s twin stage assistants will be there to help Ace investigate the power of the shards in the Cursed Mirror realm as well as take care of the many magical cards and trinkets Ace collects.\nNnif\nNnif is a bunny that used to work for Lele but decided to end his services and pursue a rogue life as a smuggler. Nnif is always looking to sell you the latest exclusive power-ups at his Tent in exchange for shards.\nThe Art of Dandy Ace\n We want to give you a game as spectacular as Dandy Ace himself!This is just a sample of our work, with character designs, concepts, illustrations, and background pictures that you will see in the final product.\nDandy Ace concept art\nGatekeeper Boss early exploration\nLele in-game version concept art\nEnvironment General props concept art\nEnvironment Garden props concept art\nDandy Ace Key Illustration\n\n Rewards\nDandy Ace (digital)\nYou\u2019ll receive a digital copy of Dandy Ace for your Steam Account!\nBeta Access\nGet Beta access to the game in Steam!

Dandy Ace is a larger project for us and while we are confident that we will be able to launch the game across all platforms next year, there are many features that we'd like to get in for launch that are still incomplete or haven't had development started on them. There are also existing features that need improvement such as the tutorials and overall Narrative experience.\n\nWe hope to get as much of it done as possible for the launch or shortly after launch.
