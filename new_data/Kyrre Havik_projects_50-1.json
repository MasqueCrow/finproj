[{"backer": "Kyrre Havik", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Treasures Of The Troll King: a M\u00d6RK BORG Adventure is an RPG sewer-crawl adventure by Chris Bissette, with art by Johan Nohr.\nGalgenbeck is palimpsest. Tumour. A city built on the ruins of itself. Beneath the sewers the bones of the old city fester.\nThe troll-king Niduk was exiled, driven into the depths to rot and die. Now twisted by hatred and rage he oversees the small domain he has carved for himself, in a forgotten chapel to a murdered god.\nWhy are you here? A lost bet? A doomed quest for silver? Boredom?\nDoes it even matter?\nALT: A digital mockup of an A5 paperback zine. The art shows the face of a troll, furry and black with a mouth filled with teeth that interact with the text between them in an unsettling way. Gold chains adorn the troll's horns and it wears a gold crown. The title reads \"Treasures of the Troll King\".\nThe crown will be gold foil. We don't need to say much more about that, do we?\nM\u00d6RK BORG is a blackened artpunk doomsday rpg  about miserable bastards and heretics enduring a bleak, dying world.  It's a doom metal album of a game. A spiked flail to the face. Rules  light, heavy everything else. It's made by Pelle Nilsson of Ockult  \u00d6rtm\u00e4stare Games and Johan Nohr from Stockholm Kartell, and published by  Free League Publishing.\nM\u00d6RK BORG is copyright Ockult \u00d6rtm\u00e4stare Games and Stockholm Kartell.\nTreasures Of The Troll King is an independent production by Loot The Room and is not affiliated with Ockult \u00d6rtm\u00e4stare Games or Stockholm Kartell. It is published under the M\u00d6RK BORG Third Party License.\nTreasures Of The Troll King is an adventure designed for one- or two-shot play. You'll need the M\u00d6RK BORG core game to play it, unless you want to convert it to another system. I literally can't stop you doing that and have very little interest in trying.\nThe adventure will be published as an A5 saddle-stitched softcover zine. Internal pages are 135gsm silk and the cover is 250gsm silk with matt lamination and gold foil stamping on Niduk's crown. This is the same specification as The Wretched and will look and feel really nice. \nAs well as the cover art, Johan Nohr has also produced internal artwork for Niduk, the Troll King - the main threat in the adventure. If you pledge, you'll probably get to see that in an update at some point.\n\nALT: A digital mock-up of an A5 zine open to a two page spread. The pages are black and spattered with red and yellow ink spots. The first paragraph starts with a large calligraphic letter G, in red.\n\nThe adventure takes place in two phases - a point crawl through the sewers beneath Galgenbeck in search of the sunken chapel that houses Niduk, the Troll King, and a location-based dungeon in the chapel itself.\nDuring the adventure characters might encounter:\nA pile of forgotten wishes at the base of a wishing well\n The Church of Forgotten Things, a sewer shrine to the discarded treasures of everyday life kept by a strange old man who has forgotten daylight\nThe finger collector, a strange denizen of the sewers who trades in digits\nA forgotten god sealed inside the bells of the chapel, begging for release\nYou'll find a host of weird locations, harrowing creatures, and new Occult Treasures to drop into your game.\nThe dungeon portion of the book mimics the layout of Rotblack Sludge, the introductory adventure found in M\u00d6RK BORG, so it's familiar and easy to use at the table.\nThere are no stretch goals or add-ons and just five standard reward tiers to keep things simple. What you see is what you get!\nFinger Collector is for people who just want the PDF. You'll get an Itch download key and my thanks. \u00a38.\nTroll Hunter gets you the print zine with foil-stamped cover and a PDF copy of the adventure. The Kickstarter edition will be the only one with the foil stamping - future print runs won't have it. \u00a315 plus shipping (to be collected later).\nSupplicant To The King gets you the adventure in print and The God Of Many Faces, a trifold pamphlet adventure. I'll have more details about this in an update during the campaign.  You'll also get PDFs of them both. \u00a320 plus shipping (to be collected later).\nTreasure Hoarder gets you print and PDF copies of Treasures Of The Troll King and The God Of Many Faces, plus a double-sided poster with the cover art on one side and the dungeon map on the other. The poster will be printed at A3 and folded down to A5 when it ships. \u00a333 plus shipping (to be collected later). UPDATE: There will now be the option of two posters. You get one as standard in this tier and will be able to choose which design you want, and will be able to add the second poster through the Loot The Room store after the campaign ends if you want both.\nKeeper Of Occult Secrets is the expensive tier for people who want to help out and have money to burn. Identical to the Treasure Hoarder tier, but I'll write additional content by hand in 66 copies of the zine. This could be new occult treasures, additional encounters, more adventure hooks, or something else entirely. Every copy will be unique - I won't repeat content. \u00a366 plus shipping (to be collected later).\n What's that other tier? \nSewer Crawler is a premium tier for people with money to burn who want me to run the adventure for them.\nChris Bissette is a musician and ENnie-nominated game designer from Manchester. Their solo journaling game The Wretched was selected as on of Tabletop Gaming Magazine's 'Best Games of 2020' and has spawned hundreds of games using it's Wretched & Alone engine. Freelance work includes The Gauntlet (Brindlewood Bay), Hunters Entertainment (Gods of Metal: Ragnarock), and more. Find them on Twitter @pangalactic.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAll the text is written and layout is complete on the main zine - barring any playtest feedback - and Johan has provided me with both pieces of art. I still need to do layout for The God Of Many Faces once it's back from editing, but it's small and that won't take long at all.\nThis will be my 4th Kickstarter. I'm used to running them and fulfilling them. I also run a webstore and a Patreon that I release regular print games through. I work with my printers regularly and my fulfilment process is well-practiced.\nObviously there is still a global pandemic happening, so printing and shipping might be delayed, I might fall ill - anything could happen, really. The risk is minimal, though, and if you've backed my campaigns before you'll know I write regular updates and try to be as transparent as possible if delays occur.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nSustainable materials\nMixam prints on recycled paper using recycled inks\nSustainable Distribution\nI deliver all my packages to the post office by hand, on foot.

Salvage and steal to survive and endure a ruthless universe. And above all, do anything you can to get that next job.\nThis sci-fi tabletop roleplaying game takes you to the grimy blue-collar future of a universe filled with risk, but also opportunity. DEATH IN SPACE presents a vision of space where technology is broken and dirty, and society is harsh and desperate. The player characters make up a crew with their own spacecraft or station, and take on the jobs they can find, in order to earn some well-needed bucks and get ahead in the power struggles of the stellar system. \nThe people making this game are Christian Plogfors and Carl Niblaeus of Stockholm Kartell. With this Kickstarter, we hope to get the funds to print the core book for the game, which should contain everything you need to start playing. We want to continue making material for the game after the game is out, in the form of adventures and other material to use in your game. \nFollow us on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter or on the website. \n\nHere's a preview of what we hope the standard edition of the book will look like (the holographic foil is stretchgoal-dependent):\nDEATH IN SPACE has its roots in the OSR scene, and follows similar design principles. In terms of setting and tone, inspiration comes primarily from the gritty science fiction of films like Outland and Prospect, classic westerns and the grimy future of early 80\u2019s science fiction movies. \nIt is a game about adventure and uncertain journeys out into the darkness of space, it is about you and your crew making a home of your spacecraft or station, in tough competition with everyone else, and most of all, it is about enduring in an abandoned frontier system where your only hope of surviving is to take any contract you can find, sometimes having to put your fate in your enemies' hands.\nInspiration\nThere are a lot of great and inspiring games out there. In terms of rules and approach, we have found inspiration in some form, large or small, in for example the following games (alphabetically listed): Coriolis, Into the Odd, Knave, Mothership, Mutant Year Zero, M\u00d6RK BORG, Offworlders, Solar Blades & Cosmic Spells, Mutant  (1989 edition), Traveller. Out of these, M\u00d6RK BORG, Knave and Coriolis deserve a special mention.\nMost of the inspiration for the tone and feel comes from movies and series. Some of these, that have inspired elements of the setting in one way or another, are (alphabetically listed): 2001: A Space Odyssey, A Fistful of Dollars, Alien, Blade Runner, Escape from New York, The Expanse, Firefly, IO, Moon, Outland, Prospect, Sunshine, Total Recall, The Warriors. \nVisually, much of the inspiration comes from abstract geometric art and design, and old computer interfaces and manuals.\n\nIn terms of music, one of our stretchgoals consists of a dedicated soundtrack for the game, by our musician collaborator Helium Kid Kanon. You can already listen to a preview of what that will sound like on Spotify (or scroll down to the stretchgoal list and listen immediately). \n\n\nStandard edition with holographic foil (not final)\nKickstarter exclusive edition (not final)\nOur main goal is to print a durable book of excellent quality that is easy to use at the table. We aim for an offset printed book with a sewn binding and possibly some fancy extras, depending on which stretchgoals are funded.\nThe book should land at about 128 pages and measure 6 by 9 inches. You can choose from two cover versions: the standard cover, and a special edition, only available in the Kickstarter.\nRegarding the covers, we plan for the special edition to be a cloth bound book, and the regular edition cover to be embellished with holographic foil (the silvery kind with reflecting colors), if we fund the corresponding stretchgoal (otherwise, the holographic parts will be a solid color). Apart from that, there are more possible upgrades to the book in stretchgoals. Basically, we don\u2019t want to pull any punches, and will try to make this as nice a book as possible.\nContentwise, the core rulebook contains everything you need to start playing immediately:\n Light-weight rules, intended to be easy to use and quick to learn\n  A system for quickly generating player characters and their spacecraft or space-station\n   60+ different modules to make the spacecraft or space-station your own\n  An introduction to the default setting, the Tenebris stellar system, its main locations and history (with many pieces of the puzzle left for you to fill in)\n  A system for repairs, where you collect spare parts to repair your stuff\n   20 cosmic mutations, representing physical manifestations of the void through your body\n  A system for spacecraft confrontations and boarding\n  An introductory scenario to jumpstart your campaign\n   40+ tables and generators packed with setting flavor\nBelow are some preliminary spreads to give you a flavor of how the interior of the book will look like:\nThe rules of DEATH IN SPACE are intended to be easy to use and hack but also to support and introduce the setting through the rules. While inspired by OSR games, the primary intent is not to be fully compatible with the rulesets and modules of old, but rather to try to capture the quickness and simplicity of these rulesets, tweak them according to our preferences and add some setting flavor (however, the rules are still close enough to other OSR rulesets that material should be possible to use with some simple conversions).\nThe basic rule when you try to accomplish something, say force open an airlock, or resist the effects of strange radiation, is to roll a d20 modified by one of four ability values, the ability determined by the nature of the task. If you roll over a fixed difficulty, you succeed. Failing checks gives you void points that you can use to increase your chances the next time you attempt something. Beware of saving up too many though, that might result in some nasty consequences. Void points are also used to activate cosmic mutations, strange powers from the void. \nThe player characters are all part of a crew with their own spacecraft or space-station, their sanctuary in a dangerous universe. Characters are generated in a quick randomized fashion, making it quick to make a new one when (not if)  your character suffers an accident. With a list of 60+ modules that provide new possibilities, the players can successively customize their ship or station and really make it their home and base of their adventures. If your ship or gear should break, you can repair it as soon as you collect the necessary spare parts. In case you encounter rivals on your travels, the rules for spacecraft confrontations determine the outcome and whether you can avoid being boarded.\nDEATH IN SPACE focuses on the Tenebris system\u2014a system of planets and objects revolving around the star Tenebris. It is a stellar system ravaged by war and strife, where a greed-fueled mining for precious gems ended in a conflict that laid waste to the intricate trade networks that ensured technological production. With no new parts to find, almost every single object built today, from weapon to spacecraft, is put together from discarded, salvaged or stolen parts. Nothing is new.\nAs if rebuilding the system after the war was not enough, there are reports from stargazing cosmologists that the universe has stopped expanding, and that it has instead begun collapsing at an accelerating rate. The news that civilization is at its end have created a sense of hopelessness and disorder, and in many sectors of the system former vassals have taken this chance to seize control from distant rulers.\nPlayer spacecraft concept by Mattias Astenvald\nIn the heart of the Tenebris system is the Iron Ring\u2014a huge, ring-like structure surrounding the moon Inauro like a belt of metal. This is the center of activity in the Tenebris system, and here miners and salvagers huddle in cramped living quarters, waiting for their next contract and a chance to earn some much needed money. In other parts of the Ring, far from the bustling market-places and common areas, there are dark, empty sectors, where shady types hide from attention.\nAmong the people of the Iron Ring, cryptic rumors are spreading about a void accelerating the collapse. A void that whispers strange sentences to the unlucky through the ever present thick static noise that grows stronger and stronger as you travel towards the edge of civilization. A void that infects and corrupts and imbues their bodies with odd powers.\nIn the middle of all this are the player characters: hard-working explorers and laborers hoping for a big score.\nThe 99% Void Safe reward level\nVoid protection. With this reward level you get the core book in print, with the cover of your choice (regular or special edition). The book will be wrapped in foil, to keep it safe from the strange void radiation. Better safe than sorry. \nThis is a mockup and not the final product.\nT-shirt. Premium cotton t-shirt from Spreadshirt. We're aiming for a design based on the book cover.\nHandouts. Two maps for the adventure in the core book\u2014Welcome to the Ring\u2014printed on high quality paper. \nStickers. One prismatic sticker portraying the spacecraft by Mattias Astenvald, and one holographic sticker using the graphics from the standard cover. These designs are exclusive for the Kickstarter. Below are preliminary designs.\nSetting location and printed note. We create a location connected to the Iron Ring\u2014an establishment, a station, spacecraft or similar\u2014and dedicate it to you. The locations are planned to be included in a table in the book. You get an individually crafted and printed thank-you letter that also includes the location name and description. \n50000 SEK \u2013 We make this book \nA high-quality offset printed 128-page book including all you need to start playing.\n75000 SEK \u2013 Holographic foil cover\nWe add holographic foil to the regular book cover and make this book glimmer.\n100000 SEK \u2013 Soundtrack\nWe ask our musician collaborator Helium Kid Kanon to make a full-length soundtrack for DEATH IN SPACE, that you can use as background music for your games. Every backer gets the soundtrack digitally, and it will also be made available on Spotify and Bandcamp. Here is how Helium Kid Kanon describes the soundscape for DEATH IN SPACE:\n\"Sound waves from dark, vibrating aegrine were found on a 570 million year old, volcanic island. When passed through a cloud chamber, they turn into an oozing, analog warmth, layered with sparkles of cosmic noise. These are some of the parts, arranged into a multi layered space. A composition that can trigger chronesthesia. The soundscape for DEATH IN SPACE.\"\n 150000 SEK \u2013 Pamphlet adventure\nWe make a pamphlet adventure. All backers get it in pdf form and we include it in print with all rewards except Orbit Vagabond and Event Horizon Diver.\n200000 SEK \u2013 More illustrations\nWe add more spacecraft illustrations by artist Mattias Astenvald to the book.\n250000 SEK \u2013 Map poster\nWe make a map poster of the Tenebris system. For the map, we will receive some help from graphic designer and animator Gabriel Herrin. Gabriel did some work on the movie Prospect \u2013 one of the big sources of inspiration for DEATH IN SPACE \u2013 so we are very happy to have him onboard! All backers get it in pdf form and we include it in print with all rewards except Orbit Vagabond and Event Horizon Diver. Note that logos are placeholders and will be replaced.\n300000 SEK \u2013 Bookmark ribbon \nWe add a bookmark ribbon to the book, to make it easier to find the page you\u2019re always flipping to.   \n350000 SEK \u2013 More illustrations\nWe add even more spacecraft illustrations by our artist Mattias Astenvald to the book.\n500000 SEK \u2013 New adventure\nWe ask Rickard Antroia to write an adventure for us. The adventure will be released in pdf and all backers get it digitally. Rickard is a writer and designer who has written adventures for Coriolis and Tales from the Loop and worked with editing on Tales from the Loop, Things from the Flood, Vaesen and Alien RPG. He wants to take you on an epic journey to the edge of the universe.\n700000 SEK \u2013 Cults and factions\nPelle Nilsson - from Ockult \u00d6rtm\u00e4stare Games, author of games such as M\u00d6RK BORG and Barkh\u00e4xan among others, contributes to the game by providing a number of cults or factions of the Tenebris system that you can use in your game.\n\n800000 SEK \u2013 Online generator \nWe ask Karl Druid to make an online character generator for us. Karl writes material and makes virtual paraphernalia for tabletop RPGs. He is for example behind the M\u00d6RK BORG online generators scvmbirther and dngngen.  \n\n900000 SEK \u2013 Printed pamphlet #2 \nWe print the adventure pamphlet by Rickard Antroia from the 500k stretch goal. All backers with physical reward levels get it (all reward levels except Orbit Vagabond and Event Horizon Diver). This means that if you get the printed book, you get two different printed adventure pamphlets with it.\n\n1,100,000 SEK \u2013 Solar Fields song and Tenebris system soundscape\nMagnus Birgersson, also known under the name Solar Fields, will write and produce a track inspired by the material included in the book! Solar Fields has released 17 albums and appeared in over 60 compilations, including the in-game scores for the computer games Mirror's Edge and Mirror's Edge Catalyst. You can find his music on Spotify and on other platforms.   \nIn addition, if we pass this stretchgoal, Helium Kid Kanon will create a number of immersive soundscapes that represent various locations and environments in the Tenebris system. A perfect background to amplify your experience while exploring our world.  \nThe songs for the soundtrack and the soundscapes will be published on streaming platforms like Spotify, and backers get them digitally.\nThe majority of the money we collect will fund the printing cost for the book and any other funded print material. The remaining funds will be used to pay our collaborators for their work and costs. \nDEATH IN SPACE will be published by Free League Workshop, Free League Publishing's sublabel for externally designed games. They are responsible for shipping and distribution.\nWe plan to use a pledge manager, and charge shipping separately after the campaign has ended. See the map for our current best estimates of shipping costs*. The current plan is to ship the game from the UK as the default, but with distribution hubs in the EU and US as well. \n* This is based on shipping one book, the map and a pamphlet, and the Moon Outlaw and 99% Void Safe reward levels may therefore incur some extra shipping charges\n\nChristian Plogfors. When he is not writing for DEATH IN SPACE, Christian spends the rest of his time on the layout and graphics for the game. He has been designing worlds for computer games for 18 years, now as a senior level designer, and has contributed to games such as Battlefield, Mirror\u2019s Edge and Star Wars Battlefront. When relaxing, he likes to write material for his Into the Odd hack Into the Jungle. He has also contributed with material and layout for the Night Yeast zine.\nCarl Niblaeus. While almost every sentence of the game has been dissected by both Carl and Christian, Carl has had the last word on much of the language in the book. In the RPG world, Carl has contributed to M\u00d6RK BORG zine Feretory, the Night Yeast zine, and released one or two old school modules before that. He also helps running the so-called Old School Corner (\u201cOld School-h\u00f6rnan\u201d) at GothCon, Sweden\u2019s largest RPG con. There he referees his own and others\u2019 creations. Outside of RPGs, Carl has a PhD in astroparticle physics, and has spent many years researching the underpinnings of our own universe. In DEATH IN SPACE, this knowledge is used to inspire the creation of another.\nCollaborators\nApart from us there are a number of collaborators who provide invaluable assistance in making the game.\nJohan Nohr. As one half of the team behind M\u00d6RK BORG, Johan should be well-known to many in our audience. With M\u00d6RK BORG, he works tirelessly to make it look as great as it does, and we are very happy to have him onboard. In DEATH IN SPACE, Johan has worked with the illustrations, adding touches to give them a more personal feel.\nMattias Astenvald. Mattias is an artist located in Uppsala, Sweden, working in the digital gaming industry. For our game, he helps make reality of our spacecraft and we hope to make use of his great skills as much as we can. \nGabriel Herrin. Seattle-based graphic designer and animator. Gabriel did some work on the movie Prospect, which is one of the big sources of inspiration for DEATH IN SPACE, so we're really happy have him onboard. He will help us make company logos for the map poster. Check out more of his stuff here.\nStockholm Kartell is a creative coven of writers, designers and idiots.

The game content is at the launch of the campaign about 90% complete, and we foresee no major changes after the campaign. After the campaign we want to spend about 2 months finalising the last few details before doing a proper round of editing and proofreading with a native English speaker. Our plan is then to deliver the game to the printer in September, which should provide enough time for the game to be in your hands by January 2022. \n\nGiven the experience of Free League Publishing, we feel confident that printing, stocking and shipping will be in safe hands, and we will do our utmost to make sure that you will have your books by January!

Indeed, you have come to the right place, but heed this warning: Venture not into these perilous realms of fantastic sword and sorcery, lest ye be of stout mind and steely nerve. For within these pages lie the gates to a wicked world of magic, mystery, devilry, and danger! \nFoul monsters and gleaming treasures await the courageous or foolhardy. Many will perish, but some cunning and lucky souls will rise to greatness. What adventure will you pursue? What terror will you face? What treasure will you uncover? Let us proceed to find out!\nSo, what are you waiting for? Be brave and stay sharp. Triumph is within your grasp, but it\u2019s not safe to go alone. Gather your party and go forth to gold and glory!\nTHE TIME IS NOW.\nYOUR ADVENTURE BEGINS HERE.\nREALMS OF PERIL is a classic fantasy role-playing game presented as a pair of jam-packed zines lavishly illustrated by the amazing DC Stow.\n\ud83d\udcd7 THE ADVENTURER'S FIELD GUIDE is a complete rulebook containing everything you need as a player to learn how to play, create unique adventurers, and advance your characters into powerful movers and shakers in the world. 70+ pages, spot color, soft-touch, staple-bound zine.\n\ud83d\udcd8 THE GAME MASTER'S HANDBOOK is an indispensable reference manual for new and seasoned GMs full of clear and concise procedures, enlightening tips,  best-practices, and inspiring content to help every session come alive. 70+ pages, spot color, soft-touch, staple-bound zine.\nDigital Mock-Up of the Zines\n\u2620\ufe0f Simple but powerful d20-based core mechanic that encourage fiction-focused gameplay. Based on World of Dungeons by John Harper (creator of Blades in the Dark). Dice rolls determine not just success and failure, but whether you encounter cost, choice, or danger in your actions. Most dice rolls are player-facing.\n\u2620\ufe0f Created from the ground up for open-persistent gameplay (aka West Marches). Based on the formative West Marches posts by Ben Robbins (creator of Microscope and Follow). Also inspired by the excellent Hack Attack videos with Steven Lumpkin and Adam Koebel, as well as Matt Colville's West Marches video.\n\u2620\ufe0f Designed with OSR principles in mind, as prescribed by old-school luminaries such as Matt Finch, Ben Milton, Steven Lumpkin, David Perry, Patrick Stuart, Scrap Princess, and Chris McDowall.\n\u2620\ufe0f Mechanics are designed to compliment West Marches style campaigns. Focuses on exploration of a sandbox-style hexcrawl map, an \"open table\" (no set cast of characters or static group of players) and a shared, persistent gameworld (the actions of one set of adventurers leave their mark for future adventurers to see). Features \"flattened math\" so fledglings and veterans can adventure together. Also provided are advice and tools for the GM to host their own open-persistent campaigns.\n\u2620\ufe0f Gameplay is about exploration, interaction, tough choices, and survival more than slaying every monster or angling for an epic story every session. The story is created when we look back at what happened during a session.  \n\u2620\ufe0f Minimal player-facing mechanics and simple character stats encourage creative problem solving over finding the solution on the character sheet. Spend more time talking about the fictional details than looking up complex rules.\n\u2620\ufe0f Fast and evocative character creation driven by a list of 100 classic character backgrounds that provide interesting starting items and flavorful, bite-sized chunks of character background. \n\u2620\ufe0f Adventurers start as level 0 fledglings. Characters are simple to begin with and grow in complexity as they advance, creating a built-in learning curve for players. Easy to learn and teach, but deep enough to provide long-term engagement for players, suitable for full-length campaigns.  \n\u2620\ufe0f Over a dozen compact but flavorful classes, all illustrated with iconic art. Each time you level up, assign a rank to one of the classes and gain a special feature from their list. Multiclassing is expected and encouraged. Combine classes to build the character you want to play. But remember, the real power can only be found out there, in the wild.\n\u2620\ufe0f Several unique types of magic-users, each with their own thematic spells and strange abilities. Spells are about interesting utility more so than pure firepower.  A list of common spells is available to the players, while another set of mysterious and powerful \"treasure spells\" can be found in the GM's Handbook, only obtainable through discovery. More than 100 different spells in total. \n\u2620\ufe0f Hirelings, pets, followers, strongholds, establishments, downtime activities, and more. Ample peripheral content to bolster the party ranks and create extended options for play.\n\u2620\ufe0f Guidelines for GMing that foster creative, interactive, old-school gameplay. Clear systems and procedures for the GM to run a session. \n\u2620\ufe0f Gameplay puts a focus on detailed descriptions of fictional events and \"rulings over rules\". The GM can use the core mechanic to resolve any roll, or they can fall back on a useful list of \"methods\" (PbtA-style moves) that help resolve specific types of actions when needed.\n\u2620\ufe0f Assemble actionable quest goals for players from comprehensive lists of options, provided by Johnstone Metzger. Use the lists to build interesting objectives for adventurers looking to pursue more complex goals or projects.\n\u2620\ufe0f 100+ classic and new magic items that focus on creative utility over bonuses and combat power. \n\u2620\ufe0f Plenty of classic and new monsters, beasts, and enemies to fight or run from. Monsters are scary because they're vicious, deadly, tough, and don't play by the normal rules - not because they have a lot of hit points. \n\u2620\ufe0f Conveniently split into two zines. Why? So the players can be creating characters with the Adventurer's Field Guide on their side of the table, while the GM can reference the Game Master's Handbook behind the screen.\n\u2620\ufe0f Advice for asynchronous and online play.

A haunting revelation awaits travelers who enter the mansion, along with a powerful artifact ripe for the plucking.\nThis zine is designed as a quick adventure that can be easily dropped into an existing campaign. The layout focuses on high accessibility, low preparation, and ease of use at the table.

John (editor) and I go way back, so we're a good team and I guestimate that I'll manage a release around the end of April.\nAfter the PDF release, I'll give it a few days or weeks for everybody to have a look at the finished product before I go full POD mode. From my experience, there are always few very minor errors that survive editing, and maybe someone reports back after discovering something :) So my current best guess for when the POD will be available is around the end of June?

This is a great starting point for you, and if you\u2019re curious about the journey so far you can view our previous campaign here.\nWherever you hail from, step aboard with us now as we launch the series into the farthest reaches of space\u2026\nEscape the Dark Sector\u2122  is a simple, sci-fi adventure game with a focus on atmosphere, storytelling, and player cooperation \u2013 perfect for newcomers to tabletop gaming. It takes about 2 minutes to set up, lasts around 45 minutes, and no two games are ever the same.\nPlaying as the beleaguered crew of an impounded starship, players find themselves confined to the detention block of a vast space station. Using a variety of advanced gear and weaponry, they will embark on a desperate mission to find their ship and blast their way home.\nOver the course of three acts the crew will have to overcome a variety of dangers, from cyborg guards and faulty replicators to killer alien organisms - each of which is represented by a large, beautifully illustrated chapter card.\nAs these immersive chapter cards are revealed one by one, the game takes on the form of a shared storybook experience, with the players making decisions about what to do each chapter before using a combination of dice and item cards to complete the challenges before them.\nThe goal of the game is to complete every chapter in the mission deck, and then defeat the final boss. To win, you must keep each member of the crew alive. If any player is killed the game ends immediately!\nEscape the Dark Sector\u2122 is inspired by classic sci-fi books, films, and TV programmes, including Alien, the original Star Wars trilogy, and Star Trek: The Next Generation to name a few \u2013 and of course, this being part of the Escape the Dark\u2122 series, it also has its roots in the classic adventure experiences of the Fighting Fantasy gamebooks and the Dungeons & Dragons roleplaying game. \nEscape the Dark Sector\u2122  has simple rules so it\u2019s easy to learn. You\u2019ll be able to get started within about 5 minutes. Below is a step-by-step overview, or scroll down for a gameplay video. If you\u2019re interested in learning more you can read a very early draft of the rule book here. \nKeen to know what it's like to play Escape the Dark Sector? \nSit back and enjoy this demo game with the team at On Tabletop: \nAt its core, Escape the Dark Sector\u2122 utilities the same narrative game engine as Castle, but adds several new features that make it a different experience altogether: \n A 3-Act Adventure: The chapter cards which make up the mission deck are divided into three acts, each getting progressively more challenging as the mission goes on and each also offering different item drop-rates and a different ratio of encounter types - allowing for a new layer of decision making and strategy. \n Thrilling Ranged Combat: From lowly Slug-pistols to formidable Beam-emitters, a ranged combat system has been designed from the ground up to add thrilling firefights to the adventure. But even with an array of weaponry at your disposal, teamwork remains vital to mission success. \n Tactical Combat Actions: As the game\u2019s intense firefights play out, the highly-trained crew have a wide selection of tactical options at their disposal - including Shoot, Charge, Take Cover, Flank, Ambush, Treat Wounds, and Reload. Forming a robust plan of attack is essential to taking down tough enemies. \n Cybernetic Implants: Each member of the crew is fitted with a interchangeable neural-augmentation chip, giving them a unique enhancement to call upon during the adventure - from pain inhibitors to advanced-reflexes. Players will have the option to switch these out, either to swap with another member of the crew or to replace them with upgrades found along the way  - but doing so incurs an HP penalty! \nYou can find more information about these and other features of the game, in our early draft rulebook here. \nHere's an interview with co-designer Thomas Pike, talking in more detail about some of the game's features: \nSince the game is still in development, the exact contents may vary from that shown here.\n What makes the ESCAPE THE DARK\u2122 series different?\n\u2022 It\u2019s approachable - The game is designed with non-gamers in mind, but is no less rich and rewarding for it. Now anyone can enjoy the atmosphere of a classic sci-fi mission. \n\u2022 It\u2019s quick - It takes less than 5 mins to set up and around 45 mins to play. No downtime, no elimination, and full player engagement throughout. No-one will be bored.\n\u2022 It\u2019s social - Many chapters offer a the group a choice, stimulating regular player interaction and discussion. It's perfect for the pub or a games cafe, but can even be played solo!\n\u2022 It's different every time - You never know what the next chapter will be, so there is plenty of tension and suspense as your unique adventure unfolds each game.\n\u2022 It has a unique look - Many games look alike these days. Here is something truly distinct for your collection. We've worked hard to create a stylish look evocative of retro classics.\n\u2022 There are no heroes - The playable characters are refreshingly ordinary. No musclebound heroes or buxom heroines here, and there is an equal mix of male and female characters.  \n\u2022 You'll be part of something big \u2013 With a wide range of Escape the Dark products already released, a wealth of adventure awaits you. Join our ever-growing community of players! \nWe have organised our pledge levels and add-ons to allow every possible combination of rewards.\nAt each pledge level, on top of the pledge itself, a shipping charge will apply based on your location.

No matter which chapter, item or boss brings about your untimely death, simply flip to the corresponding page for full immersion into the final events of the mission.  \nAll backers will get a free PDF of each of these books delivered to them via Backerkit, and physical copies of the books will be unlocked as an optional add-on. \n UNLOCKED!    \nAt this level of funding, we'll produce a range of T-shirts for Escape the Dark Sector, available to all backers as a optional add-on. \n At this level of funding, we'll produce a companion app for Escape the Dark Sector. Free to download when it launches, and compatible with both iOS and Android devices. \nSimple, elegant and atmospheric, it will be designed to be used on the tabletop alongside the physical game to do things like: \nTrack Crew HP, play the soundtrack, display pages from Death in Deep Space, and offer searchable rules and FAQ. \nThis will be free to all backers if we reach this level of funding, but may not deliver at the same time as the other items in this campaign. \nWe can dream. \nWhile the best way to experience Escape the Dark Sector will always be on the tabletop, we can't deny making a digital version does sound fun. If we raise a million pounds, we'll take the plunge into computer games. \nThis will be free to all backers, but may not deliver at the same time as the other items in this campaign. \nHow does it work? \nTo include add-ons in your pledge, simply increase your pledge amount by the total value of all the add-ons you want. \nAt the end of the campaign you'll be given access to our pledge manager, Backerkit, which allows you to select exactly which items you want to put your pledged amount towards. \nImportant note:\nOrdering add-ons may in some cases increase shipping costs beyond the base level shown on the charts in our Shipping section.

One pack of each is enough to completely sleeve the game.\nTake your game to the next level of desirability with our beautifully illustrated neoprene playmats - transforming your play area into a computer terminal. Each mat serves one member of the crew. \nThere is a lot going on in the mission area during a game of Escape the Dark Sector. Add a bit of 'mission control' to your experience with this evocative playmat.  \nA soundtrack specially composed by Escape the Dark Castle co-designer and illustrator Alex Crispin to perfectly accompany gameplay, housed in a luxurious sleeve. A must for collectors. \nPrepare to immerse yourself even further into the Dark Sector with Mission Log - a collection of short fiction penned by published game-writer and co-designer of Escape the Dark Castle, Thomas Pike. Delve into the background stories of the crew and their ill-fated mission, and learn what little is known about the game's vile adversaries.\nAdd a new narrative dimension to your games with Death in Deep Space, containing a contextual 'death scene' for every chapter card in the game capable of killing you, and of course for the bosses too.\nNo matter which chapter card finishes you off, you'll be able to flip to the corresponding page and read out all the gory details of your demise. What better way to end a game of Escape the Dark Sector?\nIf you choose to pledge for the Join the Crew add-on, our incredible game artist Alex Crispin will hand draw an exclusive crew portrait - of you! \nHow it works: \nPick the crew member you'd like to become, then take a photo of yourself which meets our guidelines (we'll send these out after the campaign).We do the rest. You'll get two copies of the card - one to use and one to keep pristine or frame as a rare collectors item.

So that's how we started our Reroll journey, by doing this as a passion project outside of our daily jobs.\nWe have also engaged an awesome Development team to help us develop the app and also the website (if we hit our stretch goals). The prototype we've seen so far is absolutely amazing.\nWe have been doing this as a passion project with a development team handling the app programming. Kickstarter is a great way for us to validate how much demand there is for an app like this and fund the app development.\nWe also love crafting pixel art. The more we raise, the more likely we'll be able to spend more time doing this, or even be able to do this full-time! :)\nThe app is currently in development, and we have a basic prototype that is about 60-70% complete.

The game is intentionally rules-light, putting the focus of play on imagination, improvisation, and fun. The rules are optimised for ease of use at the table, with meticulous attention to wording and layout clarity. What's more, Old-School Essentials is 100% compatible with the classic Basic/Expert game from 1981, meaning that decades of adventure are at your fingertips!\nOld-School Essentials comes in two forms: a chunky tome and a modular boxed set. The content is identical. Choose one or both, depending on your preferred format!\nThe first two Old-School Essentials supplements \u2014 adding extra classes, spells, and combat options \u2014 will be available as optional add-ons in BackerKit (following the completion of the Kickstarter)!\nDigital mock-ups. Final products may vary. Some new cover art in progress.\nSee below for in-depth info on all products!\nPDFs\nAll books will also be produced as extensively hyperlinked PDFs. Once the Kickstarter has finished, backers will get early access to PDFs in their current, near-finished forms. Once all artwork is in place and everything is finalised, the final PDFs will be sent out to backers.\nFree Basic Rules PDF: To whet your appetite for this game, you can download a free PDF, featuring the basic rules for creating characters, adventuring in dungeons, combat, magic, and spells. Includes the complete rules for four classic fantasy character classes: the cleric, fighter, magic-user, and thief.\nKiller Features of Old-School Essentials\nUsability: Old-School Essentials is meticulously edited and laid out, with the aim of maximising ease of reference during play. No more searching for references scattered across multiple pages. No more scanning dense paragraphs of text to pick out details. Everything in Old-School Essentials is logically organised and collated, and presented in a quick-to-read format based on \"control panels\" \u2014 two-page spreads presenting a single topic in its entirety. (See page examples below or check out the free Basic Rules.)\nModularity: The rules of Old-School Essentials are divided into \"modules\" \u2014 cleanly separated chunks of related content. For example, the core rules of the game are cleanly separated from the rules for the classic fantasy character classes. This makes it simple to swap out any of the modular components of the game's rules with alternatives \u2014 perfect for referees who love to customise and tweak. We have lots of plans for further rules modules in the Old-School Essentials line, building on the core rules to take the game into a myriad of different settings and genres, from science fantasy to post-apocalyptic to sword and sorcery.\nConvenience: All books are produced in handy A5 (Digest) size for convenient use at the table. The small, modular books in the Black Box make it easy to find what you need. Want to look up a spell? Just grab the book of spells. No need to navigate a big tome to find the right section.\nQuality: We're set to produce the Old-School Essentials books at a deluxe level of quality \u2014 hardcovers with sewn bindings. These will be beautiful and seriously durable books!\nCompatibility: Old-School Essentials is a 100% accurate restatement of the original Basic/Expert rules (B/X), with nothing added, changed, or removed. All material written for the B/X rules over the last 38 years can be used with Old-School Essentials, without any conversion effort whatsoever!\nRefinement: The original Basic/Expert game presents a wondrously solid rules set, but the rules are not without areas of confusion and contradiction. All known omissions, contradictions, and areas of confusion have been carefully ironed out in Old-School Essentials.\nBen Milton of Questing Beast\nBen's video review of B/X Essentials (the previous incarnation of Old-School Essentials)\nQuesting Beast Patreon\n\nThilo Graf of Endzeitgeist\nThilo's in-depth reviews of B/X Essentials (the previous incarnation of Old-School Essentials)\nEndzeitgeist Patreon\n\nSave or Die Podcast\nSave or Die review of B/X Essentials (the previous incarnation of Old-School Essentials)\n\nA box full of adventure to fire up your nostalgia to the max! The Old-School Essentials core rules plus four rules modules for creating characters and running adventures in the classic fantasy genre. Each of the five books in the Black Box is described below.\nCore Rules\n72-page A5 hardcover\nThe core rules of the game, including procedures for: creating characters; exploring dungeons, the wilderness, and the high seas; combat, hazards, and challenges; retainers, hirelings, and vehicles; adventure design; magic, monsters, and treasures.\nThe Old-School Essentials core rules are carefully designed to be applicable to a multitude of fantastic campaign settings and genre conventions, from Classic Fantasy to Post-Apocalyptic to Sword and Planet.

(We'll post updates on that design as work on the cover illustration progresses.\n\nThe Rules Tome and the Black Box present a loving restatement of the classic Basic/Expert rules from the 1980s. But this is just the beginning of the Old-School Essentials line \u2014 we have many more books in the works, taking the game into a vista of different worlds and genres.\nAs part of this Kickstarter, we will also be producing a pair of hotly anticipated books to add Advanced magic and character options to your games! These new options are inspired by the beloved Advanced rules from the 1970s, and carefully scaled to mesh smoothly with the lower Basic/Expert levels of power and rules complexity.\nAdvanced Fantasy: Genre Rules\n56-page A5 hardcover\nThis book adds:\n 9 new human classes: acrobat, assassin, barbarian, bard, druid, illusionist, knight, paladin, ranger.\n 6 new demihuman race-classes: drow, duergar, gnome, half-elf, half-orc, svirfneblin.\nOptional rules for choosing race and class separately.\nAdvanced rules for poisons, combat options, and more.\nAdvanced Fantasy: Druid and Illusionist Spells\n40-page A5 hardcover; only required by players with spell-casting characters\n106 new spells that can be used by bards, druids, gnomes, and illusionists, ranging from 1st to 6th level.\nMore Advanced Fantasy Books...\nWe plan to continue expanding Old-School Essentials with more Advanced books, bringing in monsters and magic items inspired by the Advanced rules.\n\nDeluxe Quality\nAll books in these deluxe editions will be high quality hardcovers with sewn bindings. In addition to their high durability, a great thing about books with a sewn binding is that they can lay open flat!\nWhat's more, we have stretch goals lined up for extra trimmings, to further increase the quality of these books. See below for more info on what we have planned, if the initial funding goal is surpassed.\nThe Team\nWondering who's behind all of this? Allow us to elucidate:\nGavin Norman: Author of Old-School Essentials (and formerly B/X Essentials), co-creator and principle author of the critically acclaimed Dolmenwood campaign setting, and founder of Necrotic Gnome. Gavin has driven the Old-School Essentials project since its inception, and is the mastermind behind the writing, editing, and layout.\nAndrew Walter: Visual genius behind a vista of weirdness, including Dolmenwood and Troika! Andrew's flights of imaginative fantasy feature on the covers of the five books in the Black Box. Four of these are complete (as shown in the product mock-up above). Andrew is now working on a completely new cover for the Core Rules book in the Black Box.\nPeter Mullen: Revered for his fantastically imaginative work on the Dungeon Crawl Classics RPG and many other old-school games, Peter is working on a brand new piece that will grace the cover of the Black Box and the Rules Tome, and full 4-panel art for the front of the referee screen!\nStefan Poag: Prolific and beloved creator of weird and wonderful fantasy art, including many pieces for the Mutant Crawl Classics RPG, Metamorphosis Alpha, and many others. Stefan created the cover art for the Advanced Fantasy rules modules.\nInterior artists: A crack team of artists is tackling the interior illustration of the books, including: Luka Rejec, Matt Ray, Michael Clarke, Alex Mayo, Tom Kilian, Sean Poppe, Kyle Latino, Thomas Novosel.\nPlus full-colour art plates by: Thomas Denmark, Rachel Quinlan, Jon Hodgson, Olivia Politz, Tom Kilian, Sam Mameli, Emma Lazauski.\nWhat's This About 1981?\nThe 1981 Basic/Expert Fantasy Adventure Game sets (also known as B/X) have experienced a vibrant renaissance over the last decade. Many players have returned to (or discovered for the first time!) the simple rules and imaginative open space of the Basic/Expert game, with the focus on ease of play, adventure, wonder, and mystery.\nRenewed interest in this vintage game has led to the creation of a wide array of retro-clones: games that restate or are inspired by the rules of the Basic/Expert sets. In fact, the B/X rules (and games based on them) are the most popular rules in use in the old-school gaming scene.\nOld-School Essentials is exactly such a retro-clone, and we're immensely proud to be a part of the renaissance of these beloved rules.\n100% Rules Accuracy\nThe material in the Black Box and the Rules Tome forms a complete retelling of the classic Basic/Expert rules, including all of the classic fantasy classes, spells, monsters, and treasures.\nOld-School Essentials has been developed with equal measures of love and precision. The ultimate aim of this project is to produce as accurate as possible a restatement of the revered B/X rules, while improving the structure and presentation, and fixing errors and contradictions in the original rules. (For those with a passion for rules archaeology, this document describes all the areas of the Basic/Expert rules which are clarified in Old-School Essentials.)\nThe resulting books are the product of over two years of meticulous research, rules archaeology, and discussion.\nA Single Optional Addition \u2014 Ascending Armour Class\nModern iterations of the world's most popular RPG use an Armour Class system where AC values start at 10 and go up. This is known as Ascending Armour Class. (The default Armour Class system in B/X has AC starting at 9 and going down, known as Descending Armour Class.)\nFor those more familiar or comfortable with Ascending Armour Class, this optional rule has been fully integrated into Old-School Essentials. All AC ratings are presented in a dual format, for example: AC 7 [12].\nThis is the single rule we've added to the game that is not present in the original Basic/Expert rules, and it is strictly optional \u2014 Descending AC remains the default.\n\n\u20ac16,000 \u2013 Purist Character Sheet [UNLOCKED]\nDesigned by Gavin Norman.

That said, Necrotic Gnome has been relentlessly producing high quality old-school content since 2012. The team behind Old-School Essentials is by no means new to producing games! We are renowned for our communicative and transparent development process, so you can be sure of receiving a steady stream of updates as the project progresses.\n\nThe risks involved in this project are low. The text of the Rules Tome and the books in the Black Box is 100% finished. The layout of all books is done. The cover art for most of the books is done. About 50% of the interior illustrations are in place. All that remains, development-wise, is for the artists to get working on the final illustrations, to be slotted into the layout.\n\nWe've previously worked with the printer who'll be manufacturing the books, so their professionalism and commitment to high quality are known factors. They do excellent work, fast.\n\nThe box manufacturer isn't someone we've worked with before, so that is a slight unknown, but in case of an utter fall-through in communication, we have a second box manufacturer lined up.\n\nAs for the stretch goals, the majority of them are designed such that they will not add delays to the production and fulfillment of the main campaign goals:\n\u2022 The physical upgrades to the books don't entail any additional development time. (They just cost extra!)\n\u2022 The referee screen (as noted above) will be shipped separately from the books / box, so any unexpected delays in development there will not delay the whole project.\n\u2022 Development of all the digital stretch goals (character sheet PDFs, the rules reference website, etc.) likewise does not impact the delivery of the books / box.\n\nThe stretch goals that require additional print production (the Advanced books and the introductory adventure) are the main extras that could, in principle, cause delays. However, all of those products are already written. They just need to be laid out and illustrated. This extra work has already been factored into the planned shipping dates, so the risk is minimal.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u20ac10 or more", "title": "Halfling", "descp": "PDF of the Rules Tome.\nINCLUDES:\nRules Tome PDF", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2019"}], "stat": ["59 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac10 or more", "title": "Sprite", "descp": "PDFs of all books in the Black Box.\nINCLUDES:\nBlack Box book PDFs", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2019"}], "stat": ["90 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac15 or more", "title": "Gnome", "descp": "PDFs of the Rules Tome and all books in the Black Box.\nINCLUDES:\nRules Tome PDF\nBlack Box book PDFs", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2019"}], "stat": ["321 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac25 or more", "title": "Fighter", "descp": "The Rules Tome \u2014 at the special Kickstarter price!\nShipping will be charged in BackerKit, after the campaign.\nINCLUDES:\nRules Tome deluxe all-in-one hardcover\nAll Rules Tome physical upgrade stretch goals\nRules Tome PDF", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["658 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac45 or more", "title": "Dwarf", "descp": "The limited edition, foil stamped, leatherette cover Rules Tome.\nShipping will be charged in BackerKit, after the campaign.\nINCLUDES:\nLimited super-deluxe Rules Tome with stamped leatherette cover\nAll Rules Tome physical upgrade stretch goals\nRules Tome PDF", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["110 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac50 or more", "title": "Magic-User", "descp": "The Black Box.\nShipping will be charged in BackerKit, after the campaign.\nINCLUDES:\nBlack Box containing 5 deluxe hardcover rule books\nAll Black Box physical upgrade stretch goals\nBlack Box book PDFs", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["582 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac70 or more", "title": "Elf", "descp": "The Rules Tome plus the Black Box.\nShipping will be charged in BackerKit, after the campaign.\nINCLUDES:\nRules Tome deluxe all-in-one hardcover\nAll Rules Tome physical upgrade stretch goals\nBlack Box containing 5 deluxe hardcover rule books\nAll Black Box physical upgrade stretch goals\nRules Tome PDF\nBlack Box book PDFs", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["603 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac75 or more", "title": "Retail Fighter", "descp": "Five copies of the Rules Tome for retail.

Whatever version of Oceans you pledge for, it will automatically come with a 5-6 player expansion.\nThe Evolution games are known for vivid themes, easy rules, and hidden depth. With many thousands of play-tests, years of non-stop design, over 100 unique illustrations, and more content than we've ever put into a game before, Oceans is our most ambitious project to date.\nAt the game's start, the only food source is plankton, the foundation of the ocean food web. It populates the beautifully illustrated Reef and Ocean boards, shown here as prototypes: \n(Note the fish tokens you see above are off-the-shelf items we used for testing. The actual tokens will be cardboard for the standard edition and acrylic for the deluxe edition. See below.)\nYour goal is to create and evolve species so they find their niche in the growing ecosystem, by giving them helpful combinations of traits. This is a what a species looks like: \nEach species is defined by its population (the fish tokens above), and its traits (the cards above). Through the game It'll gain and lose traits, and gain and lose population depending on what it can eat, and what can eat it. Despite your best efforts, some species will go extinct! It's natural selection at work. \nBecause you can build species from any combination of traits, thousands of species are possible, and they all interact in their own particular ways as the ecosystem builds. Every game creates a one-of-a-kind world, never to be seen again.   \nMany species will be predators, each bigger than the next, all the way up to the dreaded apex predator. But some will eat in other ways, for example by scavenging on the sea bottom or filter-feeding on plankton. Below are examples of trait art - each a watercolor painting by famed nature artist Catherine Hamilton:\nThen there's a whole other side to the game. It's called The Deep. \nHuge regions of deep ocean are unexplored, and what little we've seen of them can seem like fantasy:\nWe had to put this mysterious world into the game. Hence The Deep.\nThe Deep will contain, at minimum, 50 unique, powerful traits, which dramatically boost the range - and strangeness - of species you can evolve. We commissioned scores of illustrations from a variety of fine artists to make them. Here are examples:   \nThrough unlocked stretch goals, at least 32 additional Deep cards may become permanently added to the game. \nBeyond those, there are also 8 foiled Deep promo cards to unlock. These foiled traits are more aggressive and/or complex than the other cards in the game. \nWith all stretch goals unlocked, you'll get more than 90 unique Deep cards in total. They raise the number of distinct species you can evolve from thousands to about one million.\nEach time you play, there are 2 scenario cards in play (chosen at random at the start of the game from a deck of at least 25). Each creates a major ecosystem-shift when activated, altering the whole game. It's another way the evolutionary timeline changes each play.\nThe standard scenario deck can create about 600 distinct Ocean histories to evolve through, but we're also offering up to 13 more scenario cards as stretch goals. With those added, about 1500 Ocean histories are possible. \nWe've packed all this into rules that are simpler, more intuitive, and easier to teach even than Evolution, which was already known for being easy to teach. Nonetheless you'll find tons of hidden tactics and strategies...under the surface. \nNote: Oceans is mechanically quite different from previous Evolution games. See this update for details.  \n For every pledge level, at the end of the campaign, you'll choose between English, French, Spanish and Italian versions of Oceans in the pledge manager. You can pledge for as many copies as you wish.\n North Star Games will publish the English version\n Funforge will publish the French version. Pour voir cette page en fran\u00e7ais, cliquez ici! \n Schwerkraft-Verlag will publish the German Edition. \n Ediciones MasQueOca will publish the Spanish version. You can read their updates about Oceans at their blog here.\n Pendragon Game Studio will publish the Italian version. To read about this campaign in, click here.\nStandard Edition Pledge Level - $45 USD ($5 off MSRP)\nYou get the Oceans Standard Edition and all unlocked stretch goals. \nThe Standard Edition contains:  1 Rulebook, 1 Reference Guide, 2 Player aids, 1 Reef board, 3 Ocean boards (2 small, 1 large), 120 Surface cards (10 of each type), 50-80 Deep cards (1 of each type), 24 Scenario cards, 24 Species boards, 200 cardboard fish with 6 different illustrated designs (see below), 4 Player screens, and 4 Bonus Score tokens. Note exact numbers of some components could change with final game tweaks.\nThe 5-6 player expansion contains 40 additional fish, 2 extra player screens, 2 extra bonus score tokens, and 10 extra species boards.  \nNote: unlike in the prototype pictured above, the final cardboard fish will be illustrated on both sides: \nDeluxe Edition Pledge Level - $70 ($15 off MSRP)\nYou get Oceans' Deluxe Edition and all unlocked stretch goals. The Deluxe Edition improves on the Standard Edition in the following ways:\nIncludes 240 deluxe translucent acrylic fish tokens in addition to the cardboard fish of the standard edition, so you can decide how you want to play. The acrylic fish are more durable, easier to handle, and they refract light beautifully. Our goal is to make them as delicious-looking and as tactile as possible. We'll have done our job if your first instinct is to eat them. Prototype:\nThe final version may look even better, as they'll have smooth, beveled edges.\nIncludes custom-printed, premium food bags for up to 6 players for storing your points, instead of cardboard player screens. They feel super-silky, they have drawstrings, and they help keep your playing area neat and compact. \nIncludes 220 custom Oceans premium matte card sleeves, for sleeving both the core trait cards and The Deep trait cards, plus spares. \nBox Cover Art Painting Pledge Level - $3000\nYou get the Deluxe Edition, all unlocked stretch goals, and Catherine Hamilton's original 12\" x 12\" watercolor painting for the Box Cover. Because the painting is one-of-a-kind, only one backer can pledge this level: \nPledge levels which are no longer available\nThere are a number of pledge levels with backer limits that have been reached, and so are no longer available. To simplify this page, we've removed descriptions of these levels for now. We'll add them back in if any become available again.\nWhatever language you choose for your game, your stretch goals will also come in that language. There are three types of stretch goals: \n Deep Cards: Unlocked Deep traits that will become a permanent part of both the Standard and Deluxe Editions. Each card that isn't unlocked may be available on our website for $2.  \n Foiled Deep Cards: Promo Deep traits that are more aggressive and/or complex than normal Deep traits. After the campaign, each foiled card may be available on our website for $3 if there are any left over. \n Scenario Cards: Promo scenarios that are wackier than the standard scenarios. Some are downright goofy. After the campaign, each scenario card may be available on our website for $1 if there are any left over. \nThe total value of all stretch goals is more than $100.\nYou can order as many of each add-on as you like. Note the non-digital add-ons will add extra shipping cost, which will be charged after the campaign ends in our pledge manager.\nEvolution (English or Italian) - add $40 to your pledge for each English copy, $35 for each Italian copy\nEvolution is an award-winning board game where 2 \u2013 6 players adapt terrestrial species in an ever changing ecosystem with hungry predators and limited resources.

It has been ruled for generations by the birdfolk who inhabit the Great Tree-City of Alderheart. Humblewood has endured for centuries thanks to the industry and compassion of its people...\n...but now the fires have come, and the Woods have been thrown into chaos. Flames ravage the land and destroy the homes of the humblefolk, stoking a growing resentment against the birdfolk, whose cities have managed to avoid the worst of the fires so far. Hatred burns in the hearts of those who have lost lives they cherished, and these once peaceful peoples now take up the sword and turn to banditry. The disaffected turn their gaze on Alderheart, and threaten to reduce an age of peace to ashes... \n...yet there is still hope. Even in these dark times, brave heroes can be found within the Wood. Only they can quell the raging flames that have been unleashed upon the land, and restore balance to the realm. Will you answer the call?    \nResidents of Humblewood\nThe Birdfolk \n\nThe birdfolk races have ruled over Humblewood from their canopy villages and fortified cities for as long as anyone can remember. Play as one of the five core birdfolk races:\nThe astute crow-like Corvum who safeguard Humblewood\u2019s knowledge\nThe dignified fowl-like Gallus who have faith in the power of community\nThe aloof pidgeon-like Lumas who use their gifts to bring joy into the world\nThe agile hawk-like Raptors who blaze new trails through the forest\nThe powerful owl-like Strig who defend what they believe is right\nThe Humblefolk\nThe humblefolk live in small villages throughout the Wood, but are occasionally found in birdfolk cities.

Under the guidance of a new leader, they seek to exact retribution upon the birdfolk cities and sow discord throughout the Wood.\nMonsters of Humblewood\nThe Oozes\nDeep within the murk of the Mokk Fields live several species of this most resilient life-form. Battle your way through caustic slimes whose touch is a deadly acid, sticky slimes that can suck a weapon right out of your hand, and the rare shifting slimes which feed on magical energies to become ever stronger. \nThe Beasts\nHumblewood is home to a variety of beasts whose size, strength, and abilities can only have grown thanks to the Wood\u2019s magic.

Welcome to an exciting new 5E universe from Lasers & Liches! It is an unbound universe bursting with half-faded memories, barely remembered songs, lost childhood friends, outdated styles, vaporwave, abandoned dreams, lost playthings, vaporware, and time corroded nostalgia. A place both strange and familiar. A place  for adventure,chaos, friendship, and the magic of yesteryear. In short, a place that combines your love of the present with your adoration of the past. \nDo you feel like your 5E game might be  missing something? Maybe a little Retro-Futurism?  We did too! It's time to get weird, time to get crazy, time for more freaking laser corgis! Lasers & Liches mixes untethered creativity with sci-fantasy and wraps it in the veneer of  yesteryear. Expect neon swords, Code Dragons, Pizza Slimes, and so much nostalgia inspired world building. Don't worry though, we know that your memories are sacred, and that's why we're going to treat them with care. This was our childhood too and we are giving it the respect it darn well deserves. Callbacks are easy, and this ain't gonna be easy.  \nSo, what is the Retroverse? Technically speaking, the Retroverse is an unstable plane. It is constantly expanding, contracting, and gaining new extensions. It wobbles on an uneven axis among the other planes of existence. Because if this, it eventually intersects all  realities in one way or another. There is no point in time when it is not linked to multiple realms at once. Where the Retroverse ends, begins, or even exists at any given time is an impossible question to  answer. \nThis means that you can take anything, from any 5E setting, and mash it together. Classic 5E content, mixed with Retroverse classes and species, fighting other 3rd party monsters, across a setting from your favorite cartoon?! You betcha! This doesn't overhaul 5E with a bunch of revised rules, it just makes the game cooler in every way. \nOur Website: LasersAndLiches.com\n We are creating a full 5E universe and need your help to bring it to life. This Kickstarter is focused on finalizing our content and bringing it all together into a two-book PDF format. (Why only PDF? See below) These will include new classes, playable species, spells, monsters, magic items, mechanics, deities, story, and a bunch more! We have been tirelessly pouring over our art and design to give you the best possible 5E experience and just need your assistance to bring it to light. The two PDFs we want to bring to you are The Player's Mix and The Game Master's Beats. Both will be filled to the brim with beautiful art, fun new options, and a few surprises. We have a minimum idea in mind for each and some really exciting features to include if we hit certain stretch goals. \nTo those that have followed our project so far, you know what you're getting into. We released our First Test Wave of content for free on DriveThruRPG. Well, we are happy to announce that we have the Second Test Wave ready to go! It is well over 400 pages of new or revised content just waiting for you to play. Backers will get this content within a few days of the campaign ending in successful funding. You can play with all our new stuff almost as soon as the campaign ends!\nThe Player's Mix:  This PDF will be everything a player needs to bring their Retroverse  character to life in their own world. It will feature at least 4 new classes, 4 new playable species, 4 new backgrounds, 40 new spells, 8 new feats, new sub-classes and sub-species for classic 5E, and a few other surprises!\nThese numbers begin to jump dramatically as we unlock more stretch goals. We also have a few more surprises to add in that we think you'll enjoy. \nThe Game Master's Beats: This PDF will dive deep into the lore of The Retroverse. It will offer new rules, a full campaign, 40 new magic items, 40 new monsters, a world map, and rules for adapting and creating your own settings in the Retroverse!\nJust like the Player's Mix, this will receive a huge boon if we hit certain stretch goals. Which includes but is not limited to: An expanded campaign, remixed questlines, more magic items, more monster stat blocks, and we will release a very unique type of lich upon your world!\n If you have been following our project, you may know that we tried a Kickstarter once before. We were well on our way to funding but overestimated some things. So, after only 4 days, we pulled the project before anyone was charged. We've written at length about why but the TL;DR version is that the extra goals we had in place would not be worth it to backers and pull too heavily from the project, making the whole thing suffer. So we went back to the drawing board, spent around a year improving our product, and are coming back with a more focused goal. This Kickstarter is almost entirely geared on just finishing the project in the most affordable (for us and backers) way possible. \nThe biggest changes to the game have already been made and are in our second test wave. The content now includes: 5 new playable species, 6 new classes (4 with 3 new sub-classes), 7 new backgrounds, 80+ new spells, 70+ new monster stat blocks, new sub-classes for core 5E classes, improved corruption, a new cliche mechanic, more deities, expanded basic equipment, and a bunch bunch more. \nYou may notice that this is above some of our previous stretch goals and even above our base content offered in this Kickstarter. That's because we are committed to not just delivering, but over delivering on this project. If we only hit the base funding, we will scale the project back a touch and include just a little more than you hoped for. With every new stretch goal, we increase the content coming towards you and bring an even more insane experience to your table. It's up to you to decide the final outcome!\nWe thought you needed more dinosaurs.\nWe thought you needed more dragons too.\nIf we already have a base product, why Kickstart it? There are 3 major reasons but the biggest one is editing is expensive. Lets break down all 3.\n Editing: Editing costs money, editing a lot of content (such as our game) costs a lot of money. Properly paying an editor is way beyond our meager capabilities, so we need your help to get there. This is where the bulk of all funding is going. \n Not Done: While we have a ton of content created, we are not quite where we want to be. We are still in development and our team has families and bills. Creating in our off time has spawned a huge amount of content, imagine what we could do if we could worry a bit less about food. \n Immortalize You: The Retroverse has been a community project since its first inception as a string of tweets. We love how much people enjoy our universe and the different ways they interact with it. This Kickstarter gives us the chance to get you into the universe canonically, making you a permanent part of this world. \nYes, our game has Laser Corgis. No, you shouldn't pet them.\n When we went back to the Kickstarter drawing board, we decided we wanted to keep the next one very tight. This was our way of focusing on the project without lots of fees, taxes, shipping, and other headaches nibbling away at the funds until nothing was left. Once the PDFs are finalized and fully distributed, we will be running another Kickstarter for the hardcover books (in addition to some other cool merchandise) but that is not this Kickstarter. The focus now is project completion and giving you a hand in development. The hardcover copy Kickstarter will have awesome rewards, but none that get you in the main books like this one. \nPrint on Demand through DriveThruRPG (which is who will be fulfilling the PDF distribution) is a great option for many creators but is not the route we want to take. There are some surprises we have planned that they simply cannot do. We know there is a great desire for physical books, and we want them as well, but not as much as we want to bring you the best game possible. Without this Kickstarter campaign, a physical book will continue to remain beyond our means. We need your help now to bring this project from a dream, to your table. \nThe Nostalgia Blaster stretch goal is the only tier that will have physical rewards. We're saving some of the details until it is unlocked but it will include a set of our Tesla Dragon dice (below), some exclusive slap bracelets, an exclusive laser corgi pin, and a few other surprises. This will be the only way to get these items as well, as only the dice will ever see a reprint and not for a long time. \nAll Retroverse dice are crafted by Luck Gnomes.\nThis isn't our first dice/bracelet rodeo.\nLooks like we have unlocked the Nostalgia Blaster tier! It is available as a full tier or as an add-on. If you are at the Tester tier or higher, simply add $25 to your pledge and its added automatically. Anyone backing us over $100 already has this pack added to their tier at no extra charge. It's our way of thanking you for backing us big and early. Shipping will be charged in BackerKit once the campaign ends. We also unlock extra stuff for the pack each time we hit a new stretch goal. What stuff? Keep up with our updates to find out! \nThe dice are based on the Tesla Dragon, seen here with the Laser, Xenon, and Neon dragons.\n What are some of the new Classes we want to introduce? The full base game will include the Holo-Knight, Synth Weaver, Henshin (formerly Goreangyr), and De-Fragger! You can see pictures of them below. We also hope to expand the roster (with your funding help) to include the Apogee (formerly Code Warlock), Glitch Hunter, Datamancer, and Icon. We promise to work on them until they are as fun as can possibly be!\nAll the classes available in the First Test Wave have been broken apart, injected with essence of cool, and put back together with 3 new sub-classes! The Holo-Knight now has the Hard, Soft, and Quantum Light sub-classes. The Synth Weaver now has the Beat Booster, Beat Mixer, and Beat Breaker possibilities (as well as a complete backbone overhaul). The Henshin now includes three mask types, Power, Magic, and Speed, depending on which type of spandex warrior you want to employ. And the De-Fragger has the Vaccine, Data, and Virus sub-classes, depending on how you handle corruption. We've spent a ton of time working on them (and taking your feedback) to make them even cooler than they already were. \nClockwise from the top: Synthweaver, De-Fragger, Glitch Hunter, Henshin, Holo-Knight, Apogee.\nOne of our Holo-Knight sub-classes.\nA Restless Vaccine De-Fragger.\nA Beat Mixer Synthweaver.\nA Speed Mask Henshin riding their Network Cycle.\nThere is a lot to the Retroverse. A LOT. In order to make it manageable and to continue to be able to test new and exciting features (and sleep!), we are breaking the testing period into waves. It also allows you to play with our stuff as its being developed, no waiting for the final versions to play! When the Kickstarter  ends (if we are funded) we will release the second wave to anyone over a certain backer level (this will be the only way to get this content for now). It includes well over 400 pages of brand new content! You can play with some of the new classes and sub-classes, playable species, magic, monsters, magic items, and rules almost immediately! It also comes with the next chapter in the Warren's Grove campaign, giving you two missions (3 with our free Halloween special) to play! Each new wave will have an additional quest, growing to the eventual full campaign to be included in the Game Master's Beats. (There will also be some missions in the Game Master's Beats that are not available in the test waves.)\nIn a few months time we will release the third test wave. There is not a set date for this as the amount of  content within the third test wave is highly dependent on how  successful the Kickstarter is. We want to make sure that, even though we are still testing it, we release quality content to you. We are not going to rush this project. If there needs to be more test waves, then we simply do more. \nAs a backer you will have full access to the development process with frequent updates. You will know exactly when the third (and maybe more) test waves are coming!\n If you would like to try a sample of what we are making, head on over to our DriveThruRPG page and download the Silver Best Selling (NOW ELECTRUM) First Test Wave or our Halloween Special. They're 200+ combined pages of pure awesome. Did we mention they are free? \nLasers & Liches First Test Wave  \nLasers & Liches Halloween Special\n You can also see some live play sessions of our game here. \nA possible \"shiny\" version of a dragon wyrmling.\n Here's what some people have been saying about the Retroverse!\n As we hit certain stretch goals, we will reveal more specifics about each one. \n\nUpdated 3/10\n\nChris Lock and LLuis Abadias are the powerhouse duo that comprise the entirety of the Lasers & Liches team. After bonding over a mutual love of the absurd nature of retro-futurism, a general malaise for traditional fantasy, and a love of lasers, they began working on the Retroverse project. Their love of the silly, love for their community, and love for each other has pushed this project to places neither of them would have thought possible. Between the two of them, they have run years of games, created several mildly successful projects, and generated a ton of free content for the TTRPG community. They both live on twitter.

I can only apologize so much before it becomes stale. I hate that everything has turned out in, quite possibly, the worst way it could. We started very strong, and have done cool stuff, but the immensity of this project and my own personal life crushed me. All that being said, I am proud of what we have made so far. It's not finished, not by a bit, but it's dang cool and it's a lot of dang cool. All I can really tell you is that I've done my best, we will finish it, and that it hasn't been abandoned.

The final chapter of Warren's Grove has been the main focus for a bit but we just finished work on the Datamancer. That class took a while to get to something that will actually be fun to play and is going to require lots of breaking. We've also been shoring up the content that's already been released to (hopefully deliver a less broken version of) everything in Test Wave 3. None of this is nice and flashy yet and is taking a long time on my part, which is why there has been a lack of updates. I'm very sorry about that, I just hate having nothing exciting to show as the bar for our content is (in my opinion at least) pretty high. Updates like this can be just as frustrating as having no update (again, in my opinion). All that being said, we're very close to being done with everything (we've already hit the number of things we said and then some on most of the content already released) that is going into Test Wave 3, and then it's just a matter of putting it in our new format and splitting it into its separate books, instead of the massive tome it has been. All that's really missing from the core content is finishing the Warren's Grove questline (Black Castle) and adding more backer content.

Over the past decade, our library of gateway and filler games have entertained, inspired, and provided an opportunity to make memories around the game table, and it all started with our flagship title, Tsuro: The Game of the Path.  We couldn\u2019t think of a better way to celebrate this 10 year milestone than by returning to the series that started it all - so we welcome you to the launch of a brand new Tsuro game!\nLong ago, a vengeful god stole the stars from the night sky. To illuminate the night, brave people released glowing paper lanterns toward the heavens. This act of hope summoned clever magical phoenixes, who soared through the sky and raced toward the lanterns. \nAs the birds flew from lantern to lantern, their enchanted touch transformed the lanterns into brilliant new stars! Before the people's very eyes, the night sky became illuminated with beauty, all because of the firebirds.  The phoenix that creates a constellation of seven new stars will illuminate the night sky and once again restore balance to Tsuro...the path of life! \nIn Tsuro: Phoenix Rising, an exhilarating new entry in the classic Tsuro series, each player is a phoenix, soaring across the board in an effort to reach glowing lanterns and transform them into new stars in the night sky.  The first player to collect seven star tokens wins the game!\nTsuro: Phoenix Rising builds upon the foundation of classic Tsuro \u2013 you must play tiles to extend your path, traverse the board, and be aware of your surroundings \u2013 but it adds exciting new features such as double-sided path tiles that allow for diagonal movement and can be flipped and rotated to choose your destination, as well as a revolutionary new molded board.  As a phoenix, you also have the astounding ability to rise from the ashes and return to the board once per game! \nAll New Gameplay! \u2013 Become a phoenix!  Soar across the board, flipping and rotating the double-sided tiles to build your path on the revolutionary new modular board.\nNew Twist on classic Tsuro \u2013 Builds upon the foundation of Tsuro \u2013 create your path, stay on the board \u2013 but introduces exciting new elements such as set collection, strategic board manipulation\u2026and the ability to rise from your ashes and return!\nExclusive Kickstarter Content! \u2013 Pledge now so you don\u2019t miss out!  Kickstarter set comes with these exclusive items you won't find in stores later*:  \n* Exclusive content layout and visuals will vary from those pictured on this page.  Exclusive items may be sold by Calliope Games at conventions or online but will not be available through standard distribution.\nEvery copy of the game comes with:\n4 innovative game trays, which connect to form the game board\n36 double-sided Path tiles \n1 Phoenix tile \n1 translucent acrylic First Player marker\n8 Phoenix miniatures \n8 glass bead \"ash\" Life tokens \n7 \"glowing\" translucent Lantern markers: 3 Red, 2 Blue, and 2 Yellow\n50 golden Star tokens\n1 Rulebook\nThe Kickstarter Exclusive Set also features these upgrades and additional materials which will not be available as add-ons later:\nAnd every copy of the game will come with these unlocked stretch goals:\nHere's a closer look at some of the premium components included in every copy of the game:\nEight beautifully sculpted Phoenix miniatures\nSeven \"glowing\" translucent Lantern markers in three shapes.\nThe unique patented tray allows one tile to be flipped and rotated without disturbing the others.\n*Note that the final appearance of all components and upgrades may change. \nTsuro: Phoenix Rising is built on the foundation of the classic game Tsuro: The Game of the Path by Tom McMurchie.  Some core gameplay elements remain, such as placing tiles and moving your pawn along the path.  However, as a Phoenix, your turns in the game will now consist of extending your path, moving your Phoenix pawn, transforming Lanterns into Stars, and scoring Stars to make a constellation!\nFor additional copies of the standard retail edition of Tsuro: Phoenix Rising, manually add $40 per game to your pledge.  There is no extra shipping for one additional copy.  To receive 3-6 copies of the game, manually add double the shipping cost. \nPledge $20 now to be a part of the Tsuro: Phoenix Rising retailer program and receive your full margin plus 4 additional points for your support.  You may choose the Standard Retail Edition or Kickstarter Exclusive Set.  You will also have an opportunity to fill out your order with other Calliope titles at the same margin; FFA $350 (destination USA - See FAQ for details).  Retailer orders will be shipped with all other Kickstarter orders prior to standard distribution. Your final order and payment will not be finalized until the game is ready to ship.  Orders must be placed in case quantities (6 units per case); maximum two cases per location. \nPhysical store verification will be required; you must provide the store name, store address, phone number, EIN number, and website or Facebook page. If you choose this option and we determine you are not a brick-and-mortar retailer, you will be charged the difference in price for one standard retail edition of Tsuro: Phoenix Rising after the campaign. No refunds will be issued. Result of the verification process by Calliope Games will be final.  \nNOTE: International retailer copies will be shipped at the same time as all international backer copies; international freight forwarding may cause delays in fulfillment.  \nThe truth is, we packed all possible quality and value in the presentation of Tsuro: Phoenix Rising.  Upgraded tile thickness?  Done.  Fancy components?  Included.  Amazing tray?  You got it!!  So we can't approach stretch goals the same way other campaigns might.\nInstead, we are going to treat stretch goals as a bonus for backers, to celebrate the entire Tsuro series!\nEveryone at the Standard Retail Edition, Kickstarter Exclusive Set, Legacy of Tsuro, or Way of the Retailer pledge levels will receive all unlocked stretch goals when Tsuro: Phoenix Rising is fulfilled!  No additional charge or shipping will be required!  \nA note about grouping multiple copies of Tsuro: Phoenix Rising:\nEach copy of Tsuro: Phoenix Rising at the Standard Retail Edition, Kickstarter Exclusive Set, Legacy of Tsuro, or Way of the Retailer levels will come with one of each stretch goal item, so you can put together a group pledge and every copy will come with the goodies!  This also means retailers will be able to provide the stretch goal items for all copies!\nWe are offering subsidized shipping costs in order to strike the best balance of value for our backers and actual cost to us. We have strategically partnered with trusted fulfillment partners around the world experienced in shipping Kickstarter rewards.\n*See Update #2 for list of EU Neighbor countries. \nThe above costs reflect the Standard Retail Edition and Kickstarter Exclusive Set pledge levels; Way of the Retailer and Legacy of Tsuro levels may be slightly higher due to quantity of boxes to be shipped.  Shipping costs will be charged after the campaign ends through CrowdOx. \n10 years ago, Calliope Games began as a collaboration between Dawne Weisman, Jordan Weisman, and Ray Wehrs. All of us are experienced game industry professionals who have worked together since 1999 when we collectively launched WizKids. Calliope Games has been producing and selling quality tabletop games since 2009. Our products are inspired by family for families. To date we have released 19 titles, many of which were brought to life here on Kickstarter!\nAt Calliope Games, we publish fun, affordable, family-style tabletop games for all to enjoy.  \nWith gamers in mind, our games make the perfect \"gateway\" or \"filler\" game. They allow you to easily draft your non-gamer friends into your favorite hobby. Calliope games are excellent for starting out game night and are easily played between heavier games. It\u2019s important to point out to our non-gamer friends that we do take a slightly different approach to the games we produce. At Calliope, we focus on entertaining adults; however, the games we produce allow children to compete with their parents without the parents \u201cthrowing\u201d the game. It\u2019s a really a pretty simple concept; instead of having the parents step down into the child\u2019s world, we are inviting the child to step up into the parents' world.  \nFor gamers and non-gamers alike, the results of our efforts are games that are accessible by all players regardless of skill level or age, play in under 60 minutes, are affordably priced, and most of all\u2026 are a blast to play!\nIf you would like to add other amazing games from our catalog to your pledge, you may do so by manually adjusting your pledge using the amounts below.  The appropriate shipping will be collected post-campaign when the survey is sent.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWith any venture, there are risks... those that are seen, and those that are unseen. The biggest foreseeable risks we currently face are manufacturing in China and shipping issues from China to our warehouse here in the US.\n\nEach of these risks is greatly minimized with Calliope Games. Our factories have been with us for many years. They know how we work and the quality we expect. In addition, our freight forwarder and fulfillment teams are world class and have over 30 years of expertise to rely upon. If any issues arise, we will know of them far in advance and will be able to overcome them.\n\nUpcoming tariffs may influence costs as well. Typically these are 10%-25% of our total manufacturing cost. Should tariffs affect prices, these will be reflected in the post-campaign shipping and fulfillment cost.\n\nAs far as the unseen risks... we know they are there and we have built a safety margin into our costs of goods sold to prepare us for the unforeseen.

I've found strength and solace in others' work throughout my life, and it is my hope that this album provides a place of restful healing for you as well. \nI'm asking for your help funding the production of my debut album! It is the first of its kind, carving out a healing world, a new genre that combines video game hardware, acoustic instruments, and ethereal vocals. And a tour! With 3 cities already confirmed in North America, I look forward to meeting all you lovely humans. \nYou may have heard my voice on tracks that I\u2019ve done with friends in the EDM world.\nWhat do you do?\nI produce music under the name Azuria Sky. In the past few years I\u2019ve written numerous songs and performed them at multiple shows around the country. If you\u2019re familiar with the chipmusic scene, you\u2019ll know that this was my home, where I have spent most of my time growing.\nPulsewave / Babycastles - New York, NY (@lippemfg)\nPhoto: @lippemfg\nBabycastles - New York, NY\nWayward Social - Brooklyn, NY (@lippemfg)\nI use old video game hardware in conjunction with acoustic guitar and piano to create this very raw fabric of sound to sing over. I first experimented with this combination in the song Listen_, the opening track of my album Gravity, which I released in 2015.\nThis new album is a conscious exploration of that sound -- it\u2019s an auditory portrait of emotions I have seen and felt over the past 3 years. It\u2019s very personal. I think the music that I write is the most intimate way I can express what I\u2019ve been through, and the only way I know how to connect with and uplift others. \nThree years and 3,000 miles later, I have arrived in Los Angeles, ready to start a new chapter. \nThank you for supporting my work. I hope it brings you as much solace and healing as it has for me. \nPulsewave / Babycastles - New York, NY (@lippemfg)\nWhat is the difference between composition and production?\nComposition is the process of birthing the song -- it is when I figure out what note goes where, what sound goes beep and what sound goes TWANG. I try to get these ideas down as quickly as possible, so many of these drafts are full of background noise and static, often recorded on my phone.\nAll the drafts are fully composed, and ready to for me to hunker down over to produce and package into delivery ready MP3s! The next phase is production.\nProduction is the part that requires meticulous attention, and can be quite arduous. This is when the audio cables and mixing board comes out. It\u2019s the journey of sitting in front of the microphone and playing dozens of takes until you find the perfect phrasing and timbre. It's when the pop-filter rescues the microphone from condensation formed by me breathing on it for a billion hours. It\u2019s the task of shaping sounds, making sure each instrument and each detail is delivered with the utmost clarity. Production is the process that brings the ideas and notes to life, it\u2019s where the magic enters the mix. \nWhy do you need my help?\nCommercial recording studio costs are prohibitively expensive. Most run anywhere from 300-500 USD per session.\nDigital music production has progressed drastically over the past decade, and with dedication and time it is 100% possible to produce radio quality music in a home studio. \nI\u2019m a one-person team. With an absurd amount of self-motivation, a hearty dose of confidence, and several years of experience under my belt, I need your help so that I can focus all my efforts over the next few months towards bringing this album to you.\nSo that leads to the question --\nWhy are you self-releasing?\nBitxBit, Digital Arts Demo Space - Chicago, IL (@chiptography)\nWith an overarching project of this magnitude, it makes sense to navigate from the captain\u2019s chair whenever possible. Relying on someone else to package and deliver your experience adds more moving parts to the equation.

A pair of Joy-con rails on either side of the grip allow you to flip the Switch 90 degrees for vertical handheld action. \nThe Switch has become an amazing machine for playing classic games on-the-go. Classic titles are being re-released on the Switch at a rapid pace, with new ones coming out each week. \nMany Switch re-releases of classic titles, like those from Namco and SNK, include display options to rotate the game\u2019s display 90\u00ba for games that appeared in arcade cabinets with vertical-mode screens.\nOn previous consoles, few people could make use of vertical-mode orientation features \u2014 it's hard to turn a television sideways, after all. A few PSP games supported rotation, but playing an intense arcade shooter while you grip the top and bottom of the PSP was far from a great experience. \nThe Switch changes everything. Because you can remove the Joy-Cons from the system, we can finally play classics like Punch-Out!!, Galaga, and Strikers 1945-II properly in vertical mode.\nHowever, Nintendo never designed the Switch to be used in portable vertical mode. The system's Joy-Con rails only allow you to hold the Switch in horizontal mode.\nUntil now, using the Switch in vertical mode required propping up the console sideways on a stand to use as a tabletop system. That's better than nothing, but it doesn't get to the heart of what Switch is all about: portability.\nThe Flip Grip makes portable vertical-mode gaming possible. Simply slide the Switch into the Flip Grip, then attach Joy-Cons, and voila \u2014 a handheld system capable of playing vertical-mode games without wasting a single pixel of real estate. \nWith publishers like SNK and Capcom releasing new classic titles for the Switch, the number of games available to play in vertical mode will only grow. And not just classic games \u2014 modern releases like Ikaruga include vertical-mode support, too. \nAnd the Flip Grip is the key to being able to enjoy these releases on-the-go.\nNote that this is a 3D printed prototype and is not representative of the final product.\nThe Flip Grip consists of a single piece of durable injection-molded plastic designed to hold the Switch rotated 90 degrees counterclockwise. Slide the Switch in until it clicks into place, then slide the Joy-Cons into the rails on either side just like you would on the console. \nThe rails on the Flip Grip are designed to emulate the same rails you find on the Switch itself, so installation and removal of Joy-Cons is easy and familiar.  \nThe Flip Grip has been designed to accept the Switch in only one direction (90 degrees counterclockwise). This orientation exposes the game card and SD card slots, as well as the headphone jack.  \nYou don't need to worry about inserting the console the wrong way \u2014 the inner edge of the Flip Grip is specially molded to the shape of the Switch, and won't allow you to slide it in all the way in the wrong direction. \nThe Flip Grip also has a rubber bump on the inside that holds your Switch securely in place to prevent the console from falling out during active play sessions.\nTo release the Flip Grip, press the release buttons on each Joy-Con and slide them up to remove them. \nPull gently on the small release tab on the back side of the Flip Grip to unlock the Switch from the grip. \nThe Flip Grip isn't just for handheld gaming! You can also use it as a stand, too. One of the slots on the back of the Flip Grip allows you to use any credit card to prop up the Switch for social play\u2026 or just give your tired arms a break.\nThe Flip Grip is brought to you courtesy of a game nerd power trio:\nJeremy Parish/Retronauts: This project got its start when Retronauts podcast co-host and former 1UP/IGN/USgamer editor Jeremy Parish realized Namco Museum on Switch supported vertical play, but that Switch itself didn't. After it became clear that no one intended to bridge that gap, he began exploring the possibility of making it happen himself. \nMike Choi: As a hardware engineer, inventor, and avid video game player, Mike Choi took the Flip Grip concept from Jeremy\u2019s napkin sketch into a real-deal accessory. Through months of prototyping and iterating, Mike has arrived at an elegant, durable, and inexpensive design for the Flip Grip, as well as the Flip Grip\u2019s charming mascot, Flippy. \nFangamer: The glue that holds this project together, Fangamer's years of experience managing ventures like this has made Flip Grip possible. They connected Jeremy and Mike, consistently rolled 20s for sanity checks, and have midwifed this campaign into existence. \nThe hard work of designing and prototyping is complete, but manufacturing Flip Grip requires a commitment of thousands of dollars up-front, and it's important for us to be sure that an audience exists for such a niche product before sinking that much money into this beautiful dream of ours. \nAs such, this will be a very straightforward Kickstarter campaign. Want a Flip Grip? That's what the campaign is here for!\nThis isn't about some impossible, pie-in-the-sky dream: Flip Grip is fully designed and ready to manufacture. We\u2019ve got our vendors in place and they\u2019re ready to go. We just need to raise the funds to cut the tools that will be used to mass produce Flip Grip. \nFangamer has its own warehouse and distribution system, so the logistics of Flip Grip shipping are all in-hand. We\u2019ve set a target date of November for shipping Flip Grip.\nWhile Flip Grip production is locked in, there are still a few caveats we need to mention.\nVertical UI (or lack thereof)\nFirst, Nintendo didn't design Switch for use in vertical mode. That means Flip Grip is awesome for actually playing games that offer a screen rotation feature, but everything outside those games is going to appear and operate sideways \u2014 you know, systems menus and eShop and the like. You'll probably only want to make use of Flip Grip during gameplay.\nThat said, many developers do incorporate a rotated system interface inside games that support vertical mode. It's case-by-case, but some games will offer a better experience than others.\nFunctionality with Flip Grip\nThe other concern is, well, Nintendo really didn't design Switch for use in vertical mode. A few critical features run along Switch's upper and lower edges, and the Flip Grip unavoidably obstructs some of them.\nFlip Grip provides access to the headphone jack, SD Card slot, and Game Card slot. You can't access the physical power or volume buttons with the Flip Grip in place, but you can access volume, brightness and sleep options by long pressing the home button on the right Joy Con.\nThis is an inconvenience, no question about it \u2014 you need to slip the Switch out of the Flip Grip in order to power it off completely, or recharge its battery. Otherwise, you can still access most functionality by long pressing the home button and navigating the system menus, even when the Flip Grip is attached.\nVenting and Thermal Concerns\nOne of the biggest questions we\u2019ve seen about early teases of Flip Grip is around heat and venting issues. \u201cWon\u2019t the Flip Grip cause the Switch to overheat by covering the vents?\u201d\nUpon first glance, it may look like the Flip Grip covers some of the vents on the Switch. Although these vents are not visible when the Flip Grip is installed, air is still flowing through them. The Flip Grip doesn\u2019t come anywhere close to creating an airtight seal around your console; there are slits and clearances that allow air to enter in and out of the necessary vents.\nTo prove this in practice, we\u2019ve run extensive tests that show that there are no appreciable differences in temperature when the Flip Grip is installed, even when running intensive games like Breath of the Wild.\nTo put you even more at ease, the simple reality is that Nintendo designed Switch to use less power while in handheld mode\u2026 and less power usage means lower temperatures. Even high-impact games like Breath of the Wild don't generate enough heat during play to bring the system's internal temperature anywhere near its limits. The Switch only operates at full power when docked, and it's physically impossible to dock your system while using Flip Grip.\nWe've also shared the Flip Grip with quite a few developers and publishers, and none of them have expressed concern about this feature.\nMaintaining airflow through the vents is something we\u2019ve been very mindful of from our first prototype, and we feel obligated to tell you exactly what we\u2019ve learned and let you draw your own conclusions. Although our extensive testing has made us confident the Flip Grip is completely safe to use, we take no responsibility in the unlikely event that your Switch is damaged or malfunctions while you\u2019re using the Flip Grip.\nOrientation Compatibility\nOh, and one other small concern: While Flip Grip works perfectly now with dozens of games, there are one or two titles that only support 90-degree rotation in the opposite direction of Flip Grip's orientation. D'oh! Hopefully Flip Grip will turn out to be such a huge success that those developers will patch in a reverse orientation option\u2026\n The Flip Grip project is a work of genuine passion from people who love classic games, who love handheld games, and who love the Switch. We\u2019re also excited to see how the Flip Grip enables developers to release new vertical-mode experiences for the Switch.  \nWe're not out to make a huge profit from this campaign \u2014 we simply want to make Flip Grip a reality and get it into as many people's hands as possible. There's never been a console better suited to putting perfect arcade recreations in your hands, and we want to play a part in bringing those experiences to you.\nThank you!\n___\nIn order fulfill your backer rewards, personal data will be transferred from Kickstarter to Fangamer, both US companies, and used in accordance with Fangamer\u2019s Privacy Policy.\nFinal product may differ from renders and illustrations shown above.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nSee above section for Risks and Challenges.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 12 or more", "title": "Flip Grip", "descp": "Get one (1) Flip Grip, the perfect accessory for portable vertical-mode gaming on the Switch.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["7,041 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 24 or more", "title": "Flip Grips", "descp": "Get two (2) Flip Grips and save on shipping.\nPerfect for multiplayer vertical-mode play for you and a friend!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["1,191 backers"]}], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #11", "update_userinfo": "Haven't received your order yet?", "update_content": "If you have not received your Flip Grip or have any other related questions, please e-mail orders@fangamer.com and we will have the issue resolved as soon as we can.

To win, you must keep every member of the team alive - if any player is killed the game ends immediately!\nAfter our first campaign in 2017, we released Escape the Dark Castle along with the first expansion, Adventure Pack 1: Cult of the Death Knight.

You'll get two copies of the card - one to use and one to keep pristine or frame as a rare collectors item. \nOur \u00a325k funding goal will cover the print run and associated logistical costs of this ambitious campaign. But, if we are fortunate enough to exceed that goal we'd like to offer you the following freebies and upgrades: \n(All stretch goal targets are in \u00a3 GBP)\nAt this level of funding, all backers will get the Escape the Dark Castle Original Soundtrack MP3 files to download free of charge. \nAt this level of funding, all backers will get the new and improved Tales from the Dark book PDF file to download free of charge. \nAt this level of funding, all backers will get The Death Book PDF file to download free of charge.\nNaturally, the sleeves will be high quality regardless, but what we\u2019d really love to do is upgrade them from the standard material to a matt finish. \nOur books will be a classy production, but if we reach this level of funding it will open up some more luxurious options and finishes to make the print editions of Both Tales from the Dark and The Death Book that little bit more special. \n At this level of funding we'd like to replace the Health Tracker cubes in the Collector's Box with something more thematic. Little skulls perhaps...\nThe Collectors Box includes a 'first player' card we refer to as the 'torch'. Given the chance, we'd like to upgrade this to an object as standard. \nIf you thought the Golden Axe was legendary, wait until you see what is perhaps the most influential relic the gaming world has even known - The Living Stone! We'll add this item card and its custom dice to the Collector's Box as standard. \nEscape the Dark Castle lends itself well to a tasteful companion app, to track health and play the soundtrack to augment the play experience. This will be free to all backers if we reach this level of funding, but may not deliver at the same time as the other items in this campaign. \nWe can dream. While the best way to experience Escape the Dark Castle will always be on the tabletop, we can't deny the idea of making a digital version has massive appeal. This will be free to all backers if we reach this level of funding, but may not deliver at the same time as the other items in this campaign.\nAfter an impeccable performance handling our first campaign, we'll once again be working with our expert fulfillment partner Gamesquest to make sure your game is delivered promptly and with expert care.  \nWe are EU, USA, and AU friendly, ensuring backers in these locations will pay no extra customs charges beyond the shipping cost itself.\nPlease note: For deliveries outside of these locations, check the rules and regulations on importing goods to your region before you pledge.  \nThe following base level shipping costs will be charged based on your location and pledge level:\nPlease note: Ordering add-ons may increase your shipping charge above the price shown below.

IT TOOK LONG ENOUGH FOR WALUIGI TO GET HIS OWN BOOK. IT CONTAINS ALL THERE IS TO KNOW ABOUT WALUIGI.\"\nEven the things we'd rather not know...?\n\"ESPECIALLY THOSE!\"\n\"WALUIGI FEELS PHILOSOPHICAL TODAY. WHAT IS WALUIGI? WHY IS WALUIGI?\"\nThis twisted take on that beloved blighter Waluigi began with my gaming parody webcomic, Brawl in the Family. Waluigi occasionally \"took over\" the web page, supplying his own bizarre comics and japes for a brief time (usually on April Fools Day). Although BitF ended in 2014, Waluigi apparently lives on, having now created an entire book dedicated to his tomfoolery.\nMake no mistake either--\"TOO BAD. WALUIGI TIME\" isn't a compilation of past comics, but a hardcover tome full of new content. We're talking 200 brand, spanking new strips, plus the original set of 50 (or so) Waluigi comics from the BitF days for context.\nThe new strips will mostly center around Waluigi having brand new adventures and experiencing life in that uniquely inscrutable way. Waluigi's world seems to be a bizarre amalgam of modern life and the Mushroom Kingdom. He'll fly a kite, sit on a guy, attempt to make eggs, take up a job at the DMV, study Japanese, sing karaoke, invade a variety of classic animated films, and that's just for starters.\nIn addition, there are several brand new multi-comic story arcs for those days when one shot of Waluigi just isn't enough...\nThere's even an ending sequence wrapping everything up, with a few surprises along the way! For instance, the art may subtly evolve as the book progresses and Waluigi's skill improves. While the comics are mostly one-offs and small storylines, there's going to be a narrative incorporated into it all to really make the book stand on its own as a story.\nIt doesn't stop there. Waluigi gets lazy from time to time so the comic-drawing duties may be passed onto his buddy Wario, who possesses a similarly obtuse sense of humor. Wario's a bit more cheerful yet juvenile, so his take on things can lead to interesti--\nWait, what's this? It appears the crew from Brawl in the Family has pulled a little April Fools prank themselves and planned for some revenge! That's right, it's a little BitF bonus takeover, square in the middle of Waluigi's own book: \"Back in the Family!\" Between fifteen and twenty brand new Brawl in the Family-style comics will be included! Here's a Star Allies-themed one:\nOn top of all that, you can expect the same level of polish that Brawl in the Family: Volumes One, Two and Three had, with included Characters pages, Comic Directories, Special Thanks (with a twist!) and more.\n\"WAIT, THESE COINS AREN'T JUST GOING INTO WALUIGI'S POCKET? YOU ARE A TERRIBLE BUSINESSMAN.\"\nThe $25,000 goal breaks down as such--\n$8,000 minimum for the book's physical creation\n$7,000 for taxes\n$3,000 for shipping costs\n$2,500 for initial Kickstarter and credit card fees\nThat leaves about $4,500 for the artist to conceptualize and draw up the entire book. But I wouldn't complain if we got more, and that's what the Stretch Goals are for!\n \"THE GIFT OF WALUIGI SHOULD BE PLENTY ALREADY!\"\nWaluigi may be a bitter blighter, but he takes care of his fans. If you can convert your love for Waluigi into a dollar amount, you'll be sure to find some purple rewards fit for royalty.\nIf you just want the basics, $15 will net you all the content but none of the atoms, with the digital book! $39 is the most affordable, direct way to get the book itself with no strings attached.\nAt $54, your book will contain a signature and sketch from some guy named Matthew Taranto, while the $74 tier grants you a permanent spot in everyone's books in the Special Thanks section! And this Thanks is even more Special than before--it's actually a part of the book's narrative!\nThere are two tiers that double your Waluigi pleasure with two copies of the book: $77 for just the books, or $144 for both with a pair of signature/sketches and Special Thanks names!\nIf you're the type that dons eggplant-colored overalls every weekend, you won't want to miss out on the top tiers: $94 delivers all of the above, plus your very own fan-art of Waluigi will be featured in all copies of the book! And finally, at $299, that fan-art will get its own unique page in every book, AND a full in-book critique by Waluigi himself!\nAnd don't worry if you don't draw much--Waluigi's tastes are refined to the point where he can appreciate even the most Dada-esque attempts at capturing his glorious visage. But I can't promise he won't be...y'know, devastating.\n\"WALUIGI IS READY TO GO ALL OUT WITH THIS BOOK. IT WILL MAKE THE BRAWL IN THE FAMILY BOOKS LOOK LIKE HUMORLESS GARBAGE. WAAAHAHAHA!!\"\nTimepiece 1 Cleared: GOAL REACHED\nThe initial goal is $25,000, and we reached it in less than three days. Huzzah! Now this vile, eggplant-colored Tome of Eternal Darkness will become a reality thanks to you fantastic fans. Clear up some space on your shelf, because the rest of your books won't want to be anywhere near this thing!\nTimepiece 2 Cleared: BONUS ART PIECES\nThis stretch goal will graft several new pages right into the book, each one adorned with a full-color new image of Waluigi in a particular style. Ever wanted to see Waluigi drawn in the style of Final Fantasy's Yoshitaka Amano, Garfield's Jim Davis or The Simpsons' Matt Groening? ...No? Well, you will anyway with this tier, so prepare those eyeballs!\nTimepiece 3 Cleared: QUALITY BOOST\nThe now-classic Quality Boost stretch goal will spiffy up the books to the same degree as the past Brawl in the Family volumes. That means 1) heavier, higher-quality paper, 2) a shiny, foil title on the cover, 3) new inside cover art, and 4) stronger book binding to ensure if can take a beating. In short, the book gets stronger and prettier from this level-up.\nTimepiece 4: NEW WALUIGI SONG\nIf you're the type that listened to A Wallelujah Chorus on repeat all month, Q-Tip those ears, because we've got more glorious Waluigi music coming your way. Hitting this goal means a new musical Waluigi cover will hit YouTube sometime soon for all to enjoy!\nTimepiece 5: MORE BACK IN THE FAMILY COMICS\nGet ready for a little extra splash of blue! If reached, this goal will add more brand new \"Back in the Family\" comics to the book, bringing the total number of them to a solid 30! I'll have to work overtime to come up with what's essentially 2 full months of BitF, but at 60k, I'm certainly willing to do that. While Waluigi is less-enthused about this goal, that's fine--he's got the rest of the book to himself already.\nTimepiece 6: ANOTHER NEW WALUIGI SONG\nMini-rewards means many rewards! As part of our \"last week\" promotion, the Stretch Goals have gone into overdrive with bonuses every $5,000! 65k is no exception, prepping a second new Waluigi song for everyone.\nTimepiece 7: A THIRD NEW WALUIGI SONG\nThe hits just keep on coming! A third Waluigi musical cover will show up prior to the book's release if this goal is reached, bringing the grand total of Waluigi songs on BitFinity's YouTube to five. That's one for every weekday to listen to for the rest of your life!\nTimepiece 8: ALL SMASH CHARACTERS WALUIGI-FIED\nRemember how BitF Volume One contained that large, double-page art of all the Super Smash Bros. Brawl characters? This would be kinda like that...but weirder. It's my attempt to \"Waluigi-fy\" every member of the cast, from Alph to Zero Suit Samus! Note that this doesn't mean every character will be sporting a long nose and spindly mustache, but rather that they'll each have very exaggerated, offbeat features like Waluigi. It's sure to be one of the most bizarre things seen by mankind, so let's make it happen!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIf funded, I'll aim to make this new book match the quality of my past comic books: Brawl in the Family: Volumes One, Two and Three, so that fans can have something to be proud of on their bookshelves.

My name is Miss Muju, and I'm an artist based in St Ives, Cornwall, UK.  My partner and I set up the Muju Studio here 8 years ago, as a studio by the beach seemed like a good plan!  We are both artists, with a shared love of nature, photography, travel, and most of all creating immersive worlds.  \nMr Muju produces drawings, paintings and prints of an imaginary dimension - Mujuworld.   \nI take inspiration from this world and bring the characters to life through sculptures. \nI've been producing limited edition resin figures for the past 7 years, and I'm committed to self-producing all my work, using sustainable materials wherever possible.  \n\nWith your help over the years I've been able to release some classic Muju characters, including the Tree Spirit and the Star Traveller.  It's been an amazing creative journey since my first KickStarter in 2013, and now I'm back with my latest creations to share with you!\nYou can see more of our work on our website : www.mujuworld.co.uk \nMiss Muju sculpting\nMujuworld has always been a place full of buildings and landscapes that are as alive as the Muju characters which inhabit the world. \nMujuworld illustrations\nThe idea of bringing some of the Muju architecture to life in 3D has been in the background for a long time, with Mr Muju often asking me to make him a building or two for his desk.\nI finally got around to sculpting one, and found myself instantly in love with mini architecture. One design then became five Muju Spirit Houses, and as I couldn't stop there, the next step had to be sculpting a Muju Temple.\nMuju Spirit House sculpts ready for moulding\nThe Forest Temple is my most ambitious and complex sculpture to date, and includes details like the temple guardian cat, some standing stones, and a tiny cosmic owl perched on the temple treetop.   \nAfter many months of pre-production work, I'm finally ready to share these new sculptures with you. \nMuju Forest Temple Sculpture\nThis project is well underway, as we've already produced the original sculptures, and have one working mould for each design.  Using these moulds we have created the prototypes featured in our KickStarter film.  But now we need to invest in an in-house production run of these sculptures.\nThe pre-production costs involved in releasing a new sculpture are high. We cast our sculptures in bio-resin, which is a non-toxic and more sustainable material than traditional resin. However it's significantly more expensive than polyurethane resin. Bio-resin is also a harder material to work with than standard resin, and takes much longer to set, only allowing one cast per day.  So more moulds need to be made of each sculpture to increase our daily casting rate.\nThis project requires more investment than previous sculptures I've released, as I am hoping to create my first ever Muju mini series to accompany the Forest Temple sculpture.  This will involve producing multiple moulds for every Spirit House as well as the Forest Temple to enable us to increase our production rate.  \nEach Forest Temple and Spirit House sculpture is totally handmade and hand-painted by ourselves, which also requires a big investment of our time.\n\nPre-order sales through this KickStarter campaign will enable us to fund a production run of this handmade sculpture series.\nMuju Postcard Set\nThe first reward tier is for a set of 3 Muju postcards. \nThese postcards feature all 3 main elements of this Kickstarter campaign... The Forest Temple, the Spirit House illustration, and the Spirit House sculptures. \n\nYou will also get access to all our backer updates throughout the campaign and beyond, so you can follow our progress from start to finish :)\nMuju Spirit House Enamel Pin Design\nThe second reward tier is for a Muju Spirit House enamel pin badge    \nSize: 3.5cm (1.4\") tall\nMuju Happy Hills\nThe Happy Hills reward will get you a pair of mini happy hill sculptures - one in each design.  The hills stand 2cm tall and will come in a random selection of colours.  See below for some example pairs: \nExamples of the 2 x Happy Hill rewards\nMuju Spirit Houses - Limited Edition Print\nWith this reward tier you will receive one 'Muju Spirit House' gicl\u00e9e fine art limited edition print.  Signed and numbered by Mr Muju.\nPrint size: 30 x 21cm (11.7 x 8.3\") \nEdition size: 50\nMuju Spirit Houses\nSpirit House reward tiers:\nThe Spirit House sculptures stand between 5-6cm tall ( approx. 2\").  Each one is hand cast and painted by us in the Muju Studio.\nThere are multiple reward tiers for the Spirit Houses. You can chose from one Spirit House, up to all five.  However many you decide to pledge for, you will be able to pick which designs you would like.  We will send out a backer survey after the Kickstarter has ended, and ask you to choose your Spirit Houses then :)\nSpirit House 1\nSpirit House 2\nSpirit House 3\nSpirit House 4\nSpirit House 5\nMuju Forest Temple Sculpture\nMuju Forest Temple reward tier:\nReceive one Forest Temple sculpture, which stands 18cm tall ( approx. 7\").\nEach sculpture is individually hand cast, finished and painted by us in the Muju Studio.  \nForest Temple Sculpture Details\nThis reward tier is for the Forest Temple complete set !\nThis set will include:\n- 2 x Happy Hill mini sculptures\n- 3 x Muju Postcards\n- 1 x Muju Spirit House Ltd edition print\n- 5 x Spirit Houses (1 of each design )\n- 1 x Forest Temple sculpture\nThe Cosmic Owl on the Forest Temple treetop\nThe Forest Temple Collection\nThe final reward is for a one-off Forest Temple collection, encased in a glass dome display stand. \nEach Spirit House sculpture in this scene sits atop its own Happy Hill. \nThe Forest Temple is a one-of-a-kind version which has been sculpted to stand 22cm tall (9\") tall.\nThe glass dome display stands 27cm tall and 14cm diameter (11 x 5.5\").\nForest Temple scene details\nA look inside the glass display dome\nIf you want to add-on any extras to your chosen reward you can! \nHow do I do that? \nYou can adjust your pledge amount at any point to add extras to your reward options. Simply click the \"manage your pledge\" button here on the page, and then you can increase your pledge by the desired amount, without having to change your selected reward tier. \nHere's some example options:\nAdd \u00a38 to your pledge = receive a Spirit House enamel pin badge (as well as your chosen reward) \nAdd \u00a315 = receive 2 mini Happy Hills with your selected reward tier\nAdd \u00a320 = receive a Muju Print with your reward.\nAdd \u00a325 = Get an extra Spirit House of your choice \nAfter the campaign ends I will send out a survey to each backer to finalise what you want to add-on.  This will make sure you get exactly what you pledged for.\nIf you have any questions about add-on options you can message me for more details!\n\nThanks for taking the time to check out this KickStarter campaign.

We have already reached the stage in production where the original sculpts are complete, and we have made the first silicone mould for each design featured in this campaign.\n\nWe have set realistic goals for the production times of the different rewards in this KickStarter. We will also vary the delivery dates on the rewards to allow us time to fulfil all the reward pledges within a reasonable time frame.\n\nWe will also keep all our backers updated with the production process so they know when to expect their rewards to arrive. \n\nWith your help we are ready to bring these sculptures to life :)\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a33 or more", "title": "Muju Postcard Set", "descp": "Receive 3 Muju postcards -

Make your way through thick forests, narrow trails and wild rivers. Race, jump, slide and try not to crash - all the way from the peak to the valley!\nLonely Mountains: Downhill is planned for release on PC/Mac/Linux mid-2018 if we hit our funding goal.\nJoin us for behind-the-scene news!Discord | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Newsletter \n            When we started the development of Lonely Mountains: Downhill two years ago we knew that we wanted to create a different kind of sports game. \nInspired by videos from Danny MacAskill or Kenny Belaey (just to name a few) we went on a journey to create a mountain biking game in which the mountain is your only opponent and nature your only companion. \nSet in a world without sponsor signs, barrier tapes or spectators we want you to feel like the first rider to ever challenge this mountain - to explore its wild landscapes and to find your own path down the trail.\nOur gameplay vision was to create a fun game - not a replica of real downhill biking. After lots of prototyping we ended up with controls and a camera system that we believe offer a very cool arcade-like racing experience. \nWe wanted to keep it simple: you can steer, accelerate, brake and sprint. We handle jumping and sliding through our custom bike physics system so there are no extra buttons required.\nWe also strived to make a game that you can simply enjoy as a pastime while still offering serious challenge for speedrunners, competitive players or gamers looking for a tough but fair experience.\nLonely Mountains: Downhill is not an easy game. You will crash and you'll crash a lot - but you can instantly restart at the last checkpoint (which is never too far behind) and due to our rag-doll system crashing is actually quite fun - especially for the people watching you crash.\nThere is no better way to explain the game than just watching these fine folks play the Gamescom Showcase (Thanks to Motoagogo 13, Starsnipe, and Bonnie Kiwi)\nThe game will feature numerous mountains - all of them handcrafted. Each consists of several sections connected seamlessly with multiple paths to the next checkpoint.\nOur goal is to allow you to play the game the way you want to. You can choose to take a relaxing ride on the scenic route, go off-road to find hidden locations and secrets, or you can go into \"full speedrun mode\" - trying to make that one nearly impossible jump over the canyon for the all-time record.\nThere's a special bond between a rider and her or his bike. Not every bike is the best fit for every rider or every mountain. That\u2019s why in the course of the game you will be able to unlock new bikes with different gameplay values, so that you can always choose the best bike for the trail ahead.\nWe also know that everyone has a personal taste when it comes to cool looking bikes. Therefore each bike will have a large variety of different skins you can find or unlock.\nNature plays a huge role in our game. You'll find no barriers or sponsor signs on the side of the road. No audience cheering you on and no winner's podium waiting for you at the finish line. It's just you and the mountain.\nOur goal with the visual as well as the audio design is to make the environment in the game come to life. Trees are swaying in the wind, butterflies travel between the flowers and you can discover all kinds of birds and animals as you ride.\nReady to see the world? The base version of the game will feature six different lonely mountains which are inspired by real life mountainscapes and locations all around the globe.\nDuring the game you will unlock new game modes and each will have its own leaderboard. There will be two different time trial modes, a special challenge mode as well as a \"One Life\"- mode which will only be for the toughest of riders!\nWe want to support the following languages: English, German, French, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Brazilian Portuguese, Russian, Polish, Chinese, Japanese, Thai, Korean.\nIf you want to help us localize the game or - even more important at the moment - this Kickstarter page please don't hesitate to contact us at localization@lonelymountains.com. We really appreciate any help we can get! \nOverview\nAdditional Information \nDollar Prices: these have been calculated on the 11th of October 2017 and might change slightly during the campaign based on the exchange rate between Euro and Dollar. \nDesign A Paint Job: We will send you a template which you can color and then we create a paint job based on your design. Please note we can't put logos or texts on the bike.\nUnique Bike and Rider: We'll design a bike and outfit in the game\u2019s style based on images you provide. After release you will receive an in game redeemable code to unlock the bike and outfit. The code can be used as often as you like and you can share it with your friends.\nWe started Lonely Mountains: Downhill two years ago and now have the game in a state where all the core gameplay features are there. The art, UI and audio direction are also set and most of the tools are tested and ready to use.\nWe\u2019ve also had nearly a thousand players playtest the game at different events. The feedback has been very good and we're pretty confident that the core gameplay is a lot of fun.\nWe feel that the game is now at a point where we know what game we want to make and can now ramp up the production to build the actual game content.\nWe founded Megagon Industries in 2013. Our initial goal was to have a shared company to publish our private pet projects but since then the company has grown into much more than that:\nWe released two premium mobile games: \u201c... and then it rained\u201d and \u201cTwisted Lines\u201d. The later was nominated for the German game developer awards, the German video game awards as well as selected for several showcases. This encouraged us to spend more and more time working on our games until we decided to work full-time on Lonely Mountains: Downhill.\nHi, I\u2019m Jan. Ever since I was a kid I truly loved riding a bike - whether it was racing down a hill against my friends or riding for a week along the Baltic Sea. Sitting on my bike makes me happy. \nMy first steps in creating digital stuff reach back almost 25 years ago. Although \u201ccoding\u201d back then was more putting together some keywords in QBasic to see what happens.\nLater on when level editors became more common I created maps for games like C&C, Doom and Half Life and got fascinated by 3D graphics.\nMy diploma thesis introduced me to Unity and since then I worked as a freelancing programmer on many different Unity projects. One of them lead me to a company called Die Hobrechts in 2011 where I met Daniel.\nHey! I'm Daniel. I started creating levels for Unreal Tournament when I was 16 and I\u2019ve been making games ever since.\nAfter graduating as a Game Designer in 2008 I worked at Keen Games and remote control productions before I became a freelancer in 2010.\nIn 2011 I co-founded a game design agency called Die Hobrechts with some friends which became the place I met Jan for the first time. We're working together ever since and founded Megagon Industries together in 2013. \nAlthough Kickstarter comes with a lot of risks it feels like the right step for us - for more than one reason:\nEarly access: We got asked a lot if there's some way to play the game before its official release. We think a Kickstarter campaign with different early access tiers is the best way to offer that.\nDeveloping the game together: We hope that a Kickstarter campaign can be the start of a community who helps us shape and improve the game.\nCreative independence: It\u2019s important for us to stay creatively independent and make decisions we think are best for the game.\nWe need the money: We were fortunate enough to receive state funding by the Medienboard Berlin-Brandenburg. However, this funding will only cover half of the development costs as we need to provide the other half. If we are able to reach our initial funding goal we can make the base version of the game together with you and Medienboard.\nSo what\u2019s happening with the Kickstarter money?\nAfter taxes, Kickstarter & payment processing fees 71% of the Kickstarter money will be used to pay for the development of the game together with the Medienboard funding.\nDevelopment costs include Jan\u2019s and Daniel\u2019s salaries as well as salaries for freelancers helping with sound design and additional 3D assets and animations.\nWe also have to pay office rent, accounting, software licenses and all the other stuff necessary to run a game development studio - even when it\u2019s as small as ours. \nWe know Kickstarter will be a tough ride. We saw a lot of very good projects who didn\u2019t or just barely succeeded. We both thought long and hard about the risks of doing this but seeing all the amazing feedback over the last few months we decided to try it anyway. We believe that together with you we can climb that mountain! ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe\u2019re probably not alone with saying that making games is nearly always a risky endeavour. We\u2019ve never worked on a game which didn\u2019t hit some unexpected problems somewhere down the road and Lonely Mountains: Downhill will probably not be the exception. With that said we already have a fun and playable core game so we\u2019re hopeful we can tackle most of what the game development gods might throw at us.\n\nIn addition there are only two of us at the moment, and for such a small team certain risks are bound to be present. If one of us gets ill or has to take time out for their personal life, it is extremely likely to affect the development roadmap.\n\nLastly- one of the reasons we decided to go with a Kickstarter rather than working with a publisher is the freedom to keep experimenting and prototyping. If we have to choose between a new great idea for the game or an earlier release, going for the idea will probably win most of the times.\n\nAs for the Kickstarter rewards fulfillment: because we decided to only have very few physical rewards we\u2019re confident that all backers will get their rewards once they become available.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u20ac1 or more", "title": "PLANT A TREE", "descp": "Thank you for your support!

Sign up there to receive alerts on any reprints or expansions for Forest of Fate, plus news on all our upcoming storytelling games!\nFacebook | Twitter | BGG | Email\nTop reasons to play Forest of Fate\nIf you grew up with Choose Your Own Adventure or Fighting Fantasy, Forest of Fate evokes that nostalgic feeling and lets you share it in a fun cooperative format with your friends and family - and it's (mostly) kid-friendly!\nIf you like the storytelling element of games like Tales of the Arabian Nights or Above & Below, you will love the tighter, faster, easier to learn gameplay of Forest of Fate\nIf you've been tempted by RPGs like Dungeons & Dragons, but haven't been able to find a group (or the courage to join one), Forest of Fate could be your gateway into the hobby - and it's much easier to introduce to your non-gaming friends!\nIf you're in an existing RPG group, Forest of Fate could be your next warm-up game, with its short run time and flexible player count.\nRead John's full preview here.\nThe response to Forest of Fate has so far been staggering. As a result, you've unlocked every stretch goal I could throw at you. The game is now bigger and better than I could have imagined. Thank you!\nRead Bod's full review here.\nI was inspired to create Forest of Fate by the gamebooks of my childhood, the worlds of J.R.R. Tolkein and Terry Pratchett, and the amazing and varied scenery near my home on the South West coast of England.\nMy goal was to make roleplaying games more accessible by stripping back almost all the conventional elements, revealing a strong procedural storytelling experience that is:\nEasy to grasp and \"safe\" for new players\nSelf-contained, and quick to play\nEndlessly replayable\nI hope I've succeeded!\nForest of Fate uses nothing but a storybook and high-quality cards for its unique brand of survival storytelling. It's compact enough to take anywhere, and has no small parts to lose!\nCheck out some of the gorgeous character art by the brilliant Milly Hanson:\nThe Thief\nThe Bard\nThe Ranger\nThe Warrior\nHere's a simplified interaction between a Character and an Encounter, to demonstrate the anatomy of the most important cards.\nThe Story Book is the heart and soul of Forest of Fate. It contains 1,164 paragraphs to spark your imagination, describing the encounters you'll face and the actions you'll take.\nA computer rendering of the Deluxe Story Book (Hero tier and above)\nYou have three choices when it comes to using the Story Book:\nThe content and gameplay for all three versions is identical, though I recommend the digital version - it can be updated later if we spot mistakes, and more importantly helps to save the forests we love!\nI've tried to make all rewards simple and fair. Please note that this campaign will not be using a pledge manager. Once it's over, it's over. If you've got your eye on something you should grab it while you can!\nForest of Fate is the debut game from Cards of Fate. As a startup publisher without a great deal of capital to invest or a name in the industry, I view Kickstarter as an exciting opportunity to help build a small community around my games and reward those who share my vision.\nPlaytesting (all components pictured are early prototypes, not final)\nThank you for reading, and I hope I've inspired you to try Forest of Fate.\nThanks also to the fine folk at Tabletop Audio for the ambient forest sounds used in my videos. They're highly recommended if you want to really immerse yourself in the game!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThough this is my first Kickstarter, as a professional Project Manager I understand risk and have taken all steps necessary to ensure the successful delivery of your rewards.\n\n-- Design & Content\nThe only elements of the game outstanding at this stage are the naming rights made available as rewards and the finalised stretch goal content. All other content is complete and all designs have been finalised and formatted, ready for manufacturing.\n\n-- Manufacturing\nForest of Fate uses standard components, and will be printed and packaged by a proven Chinese board and card game manufacturer. All components will be subject to a thorough review by Cards of Fate prior to mass production.\n\n-- Shipping\nFulfilment will be handled by Gamesquest, a well-known and experienced partner in Kickstarted board games. Backers with the EU will have their rewards sent from within the EU, so there should be no additional VAT or customs charges.\n\n-- Stretch Goals\nAll stretch goals have been carefully pre-planned and pre-budgeted.

The majority of funds go directly toward creating Mine! and shipping them out. In accordance with Kickstarter's guidelines, pledges cannot directly go to Planned Parenthood, but proceeds from the book sales can and will be.\nSo where is your money going? As with any project, there are fixed costs (costs that are not going to change whether you make one unit or a million units) and variable costs (the costs involved in producing each individual unit going forward).  \nFixed costs include things like legal fees, advertising, printing production costs, and creation of the contents of the book\u2014 writing, artwork, lettering, coloring, and so on. \n$27,000 - Creation costs for 180 pages of amazing content. \n$ 3,000 - Legal and Administrative costs  \n\"But wait! Aren\u2019t the creators donating their work?\" Yes, many of them are indeed donating their work, but not everybody is doing so. That\u2019s not a slam against them, comics is a business and they\u2019re working\u2014 indeed, we know they\u2019re taking a pay cut to work on this book rather than a better paying project. The only drawback is that we don\u2019t know yet how many creators are donating their fees back to the project, so we\u2019re using the maximum we\u2019re paying per page, so we know that even if everyone takes their full fees, we\u2019re still going to raise enough money to complete the project. Variable costs for this book include Kickstarter\u2019s fees, credit card and PayPal fees, and the costs to print or produce each and every reward. \n 5% - Kickstarter fees \n3% - Credit card/Paypal fees \n25% - Printing & producing rewards \n2% - Packing and handling \n Money raised that\u2019s above and beyond those variable costs will pay to cover fixed costs, and what remains will be used for marketing, distribution, and lowering wholesale prices to make Mine! available to more people.\nKickstarter offers us a tremendous platform and a wide audience to make this all possible. The proceeds from sales of this anthology post-campaign will support Planned Parenthood. By offering creators a page rate they can donate, we will be able to boost our support for PP in addition to sales from the book to make Mine! a success for PP and all of us for years to come!\nStory by Michael Moreci and Danny Luckert\n  Over 40 stories is a great start but we don't want to stop there. Help us reach past our goal and we'll push Mine! further, giving you more stories, a Spanish language version, a hardcover edition, and shipping more copies to libraries and politicians for your pledge.\nComicMix stands with Planned Parenthood and all the work they do, and is creating Mine! as a benefit book that will inform and also raise money for Planned Parenthood. ComicMix has obtained a trademark agreement with Planned Parenthood and has coordinated with them on some of the stories you will find in this book.\nIt is important to acknowledge all the incredible services that Planned Parenthood provides and how those who do not personally support reproductive rights should want to fight to protect. However, ComicMix and Mine! support reproductive rights.\nBy Leah Garrett, Barbara Haspiel and Dean Haspiel\n   Take a look at this brief explanation..\n  Thank you from all of us at ComicMix: Mike Gold, Glenn Hauman , Martha Thomases , Adriane Nash, Evelyn Kriete, Molly Jackson , Joe Corallo and the rest of the team.

Your species rely on food from the watering hole to survive. Want to eat the plant food before your opponents get the chance? Add the Foraging trait to eat food twice as fast. Think a Carnivore is lurking? Evolve with Climbing and escape to the trees, or better yet, evolve your species into a Carnivore and make a meal of your opponents.\nWith a deck of beautiful watercolor trait cards from internationally renowned nature artist Catherine Hamilton, the endless combinations turn every game into a thrilling adventure.\nThe \"Horns\" trait\nThe \"Carnivore\" trait\nThe Evolution video game is coming to your device this Fall. Our growing team of accomplished video game developers has been refining Evolution for several years now. Over 1,000 people played the Alpha Version this Summer. Here is some of the raw feedback they volunteered: (read more at the bottom of the page):\n Man Vs Meeple\n AppAddict\nOur team has worked the last two and a half years to ensure North Star Games\u2019 first video game will make some waves. We\u2019ve already built the core game elements and will release the single player beta on PC/Mac the day after this Kickstarter campaign ends. But there are other features we want to include for the final release which we can't polish without a robust community of Beta players: \nUnique AI opponents that deploy distinct strategies and compete at an expert level. \nA cross-platform multiplayer system to instantly match you up with an opponent of similar skill-level. \nEngaging campaign challenges to keep the Evolution experience fresh. \nBy adjusting the traits, rules, and card balance, we can drastically change the balance of the ecosystem. To help build the strong player base we need, we've added some exceptional perks for those who back the Kickstarter now instead of waiting for the release. See the Bonus Stretch Goals. Our goal is to make a game you can\u2019t stop playing. So clear out your October - Evolution is coming!\nThe soundtrack and sound effects for Evolution will be composed and produced by North Star Digital\u2019s audio director, Island Styles. \nHailing from Alexandria, VA, Island Styles is a composer and touring musician. Although he has a strong musical background rooted in rock'n'roll (as a guitarist for rock bands Candlebox and Jimmie's Chicken Shack), he enjoys creating all styles of music. Composing for video games like Evolution offer him a unique medium to exercise that musical diversity.\nHere's the Evolution Trailer track:\nAbout North Star Games  \nSince 2003, North Star Games has been making board games that are simple to learn and give endless hours of exciting play. Our award-winning blockbusters include Wits & Wagers, Say Anything, Happy Salmon, and Evolution. Total sales of these 4 brands are nearing 3 million copies.\nWe launched the North Star Digital studio three years ago so we could control the quality of our brands on digital platforms. Since then, we have built a team of video game development experts and will soon release a fresh, standalone experience with the Evolution video game.\n *Shipping Worldwide does not include Russia, Brazil, South Africa and North Korea due to shipping distributor restrictions.\nWe had approximately 1,000 random people alpha test the video game throughout this Summer. Here is some of the raw feedback we received:\n\u201cI am a science teacher. When I showed my class the demo of the video game they flipped out! You won over my class!\u201d - ThorTiberius\n\"Loved the digital version of Evolution:)! Great graphics and animations! Smooth game play. I was sooo sad when my Alpha-testing period was over.\" -Verity Hitchings  \n\u201cI was shocked at how well evolution was transformed from a board game to a video game, the bar has been raised quite notably.\u201d - Graham Lynch\n\u201cEasy to get into, yet difficult to master. A challenging, vicious AI opponent will put your nerves to the test. The alpha was already a visual marvel. Can't wait for the finished version.\u201d - Franky Lanckacker \n\u201cAbsolutely amazing digital conversion. I learned to play Evolution with the digital version and now I just bought a copy of the physical game. I feel the same about the Video Game as the physical version...awesome.\u201d - Gonzalo Casas   \n\u201cAs a board game geek, I'm very critical of ports from the physical to the digital. The Evolution video game has really made the grade: intuitive design, fun aesthetics and being faithful to the game rules and spirit. I highly recommend it!\u201d - Dane Anker   \n\u201cEvolution is my new go-to example for how a board game should make the jump to screens.\u201d - Ian Parmenter \u201cWhen i got a chance to play it on pc i lost my mind at how well the developers created it. The artwork and the gameplay was amazing. It's easy to learn and so addictive you won't be able to stop playing.\u201d - Jacob Dupra\n\u201cThis is a beautiful-in-every-way implementation of a great game.\u201d - Ron Parker    \n\u201cEvolution has finally cracked the code! Fun, gorgeous, interactive \u2026 it\u2019s smart and it\u2019s easy all at once!\u201d - Russell P. Smith \n\u201cOne of the best digital implementations of a tabletop game to date. I especially loved all the different strategies you could explore while playing the AI opponents in such a short amount of time.\u201d - Ryan Malone   \n\u201cI tried out the demo for this game at Pax East. It was pretty good then, but by the alpha test, it had \"evolved\", becoming something even more amazing! I ended up playing for hours on end, and I cannot wait to get back to playing it.\u201d - Deirdre Lannelli   \n\"One of those rare cases of a game making the jump from tabletop to digital -- and landing a perfect ten.\u201d - Doc Jones   \n\u201cWhen the Alpha test for the Evolution video game was over, I suddenly became aware that I had to go cold turkey. I mean, I had been playing every day. Then, nothing. So.... yeah. Apparently, I'm hooked.\u201d - Jeff Hesse   \n\"Evolution offers plenty of depth without sacrificing fun. The digital adaptation's streamlined interface makes it a strong contender for best digital board game adaptation.\u201d - Anthony P   \n\u201cMy wife and I have been playing Evolution since the first Kickstarter campaign. It wasn't until the digital port, however, that we were able to adequately explain the game to our kids. Of course, now they now routinely beat us in the tabletop version. Come to think of it... this was a terrible idea.\u201d - Marcus Howell    \n\u201cYou'll have to pardon the pun, because this game was Intelligently Designed.The art and gameplay simply couldn't be better.\u201d - Bryant B\n\u201cIncredibly polished game play. Nice animations without detracting from the game and helpful info tips.\u201d - BlueSapphyre \n\u201cIt faithfully recreates the experience of playing Evolution, but is far more portable. If that doesn't sell this product to you then you need to spend more time playing Evolution!\u201d - Reed   \n\u201cI was surprised at how quickly time would fly by as I tried to achieve dominance over the watering hole. The game draws you in.\u201d - Rich   \n\u201cI had so much fun playing the game, I'm constantly playing it in my head.\u201d - Mert I. Erten   \n\u201cI had such a fun time playing the digital version of Evolution, I found myself playing it every bit of free time I had in the day.\u201d - Alex Jimenez \n\u201cAs addictive as the board game- Can't wait to play online and devour my friends!\u201d - Richard E. Moore   \n\u201cThe game was beautifully made and encapsulated every aspect of the board game. Personally this is one of the most interactive games I've played in a long time.\u201d - Adam Hamilton   \n\u201cThe interface was very straightforward and intuitive compared to most board game ports I've played. I can't wait to see the final end result and the future expansions...cough...flight....cough. :)\u201d - Damon Richard \n \u201cThe artwork and animations were absolutely charming, which made it easier for me to sleep at night after having predated several species to extinction.\u201d - Daniel McDonald \n\u201cEasily playable in only 10 minutes, this game gives you the full hour experience in a fraction of the time. The AI is challenging enough that you don't always win, and I found the animations to be charming to the point that they added to my enjoyment.\u201d - Curt Collins \n \u201cThis app looks amazing, sounds amazing, and feels like you're playing the actual game. Super Excited!\u201d - Rocky Pierce \n \u201cThe digital game is beautiful and is the best adaptation of a tabletop game I've seen. The theme of evolving and adaptations is portrayed accurately and in an engaging way, which no small feat from my experience as a biology teacher.\u201d - Jeannette Gerry \n \u201cThe gameplay is smooth and the interface is intuitive. The animations are great and help to show you what's going on without being over the top.\u201d - Eric Sanson \n \u201cA very polished board game port that is true to its roots while enhancing them with the best aspects of digital: incredible replayability, challenging AI, and a beautiful presentation.\u201d - Van Willis \n \u201cDefinitely the best way to enjoy Evolution on the go. Quite possibly the best way to enjoy it, period.\u201d - Lee Nix \n \u201cPlays even better than the board game, and the AI doesn't take as long to think about it's turn as my friends ;-)\u201d - Daniel Schwering \n \u201cI loved the digital implementation of Evolution. Me and my 7 year old played it for hours and it never got stale.\u201d - Corey Brillinger \n\u201cI can't wait to get back to playing again.\u201d - Bryan Piveral \n \"The little details, like card animations during feeding phases, elevate the Evolution playing experience to another level.\u201d - Drew Tschette \n \"This is the best digital adaption i have played.\u201d - Mike Sarcopski \n \u201cI absolutely loved it! One of the best virtual board games I've played!\u201d - Zachary Henry \n \u201cMy first exposure to Evolution was the digital version. I was amazed at not only how much fun it was, but also how quickly one could learn the game play. The game kept me on my toes, provided a good challenge and has rewarding game play.\u201d - Goose Berkowitz-Gosselin \n \u201cWhen a 7 year old opts to play Evolution instead of Pokemon Go, you know it's good!\u201d - Nneka Onwuemene-Hussey \n \u201cI've never been more excited about evolving and extincting species, and doing it so fast, too!\u201d - Andrew Leslie \n \u201cAmazing port from table to screen. A+ guys thanks for making such a great app.\u201d - Michael Rasmussen \n \u201cThe digital implementation of Evolution does a really fantastic job, staying true to the tabletop version, but making the game come alive with its sleek graphic design and great user interface - a must have for app board gamers.\u201d - Max Vigne \n \u201cEvolution is a game system perfect for digital adaptation, and this is a great adaptation.\u201d - Steven Gisinger \n \u201cAn incredibly deep experience made extremely accessible. As a devoted fan of the board game, I was delighted to see such a faithful and beautiful adaptation be brought to life on so many platforms.\u201d - Steven Li \n\u201cThe game was almost perfect in the alpha test and I am sure it has only gotten better since.\u201d - David \n \u201cA great port of a great game. Challenging AI, and a terrific way to learn the game.\u201d - David Ko \n \u201cI played this every day after work. The shortcut has it's own space on my desktop away from everything else so I could find it easier.\u201d - Robert Comeau \n \u201cI enjoyed playing the Evolution video game even more than ice cream, or a double chocolate, chocolaty brownie with caramel on top. I am Soooooo looking forward to the video game.\u201d - Dawn Carter \n\u201cThis game is a blast. One night I lost track of time and went to bed way to late. It was worth it to be extremely tired the next day.\u201d - Kris Drummond  \n\u201cOne of the best interfaces of a board game ever! I even learned I had been playing the rules wrong all this time on the physical version.\u201d - Matt Slowiak\n\u201cI've been excited to play this amazing game on a digital platform since I first saw it at GenCon2016! The Alpha test earlier this summer showed a game that was already playable and enjoyable and I can't wait to see how North Star has polished it since then.\u201d - Shane Morrison  \n\u201cIt's educational but it's also incredibly fun! This game is wonderfully innovative, combining traditional board game style with animations and sound effects to make it come to life.\u201d - Angelica J Alexander  \n\u201cCompletely enjoyable with great graphics. It really helped me get a deeper understanding of the rules and helped me work on my strategy for the game.\u201d - Kim Kieffer  \n\u201cThe Evolution Video Game has given me the freedom to play more and experiment in Evolution more than I thought possible. The flawless gameplay flows so smoothly and efficiently; I have crammed in so many games and new strategies that I will crush my opponents with no mercy next time we play the board game.\u201d - Brian Ganas  \n\u201cWhat a blast! Evolution Video Game brought the board game to life and teleported me to a prehistoric world. I would recommend this game anytime to anyone.\u201d - Kurt Edwards\n\u201cI dreamed about trait combinations and power plays. Can't wait for multiplayer so I can have friends again!\u201d - Steve Smith\n\u201cMy favorite thing about Evolution when I first played it was how it so easily and completely created a perfect ecosystem simulation and I was overjoyed to find that the app did the same and then some. One of the best table to tablet conversions I played.\u201d - Jackson Boom\n\u201cA brilliant digital adaptation to an excellent tabletop game.\u201d - Robert Schuren\n\u201cThe game is great to look at and fluid to watch the animations. It keeps track of everything you need to allow you to just plan your strategy. The AI is difficult but not impossible and interacts in ways that keep the game interesting. I really like it!\u201d - Scott Bowen\n\u201cThis is one of the best digital boardgame conversions I've played, and I'm excited to take evolution anywhere.\u201d - Aric Horst \n\u201cI wish I could have played the game more during the Alpha test. After a few plays, my kids took over and couldn't be pried away. The graphics, sounds, and animations drew them in and the fast-paced gameplay kept them starting new games over and over again!\u201d - Harley Winfrey\n\u201cI've never had so much fun getting my butt kicked by such a well designed AI.\u201d - Xavier\n\u201cSome of the things I love about the video game is its beautiful graphics paired with animation that doesn't change the feeling of the game.\u201d - Tara Ashley\n\u201cPlayed for several hours on a flight from Paris to Addis Ababa. Very much enjoyed the game resulting in no sleep on the red-eye flight.

Super well designed and amazingly fun!\u201d - Clay Diffrient\n\u201cAs a software developer, I am extremely impressed with the stability and software quality of the alpha version. Very few bugs, and very few freezes. Most of the playtesters' input has been tweaking features or improving the AI. Well done!\u201d - Robert O'Hearne\n\u201cPlaying the digital version of Evolution was my first experience with the game and the tutorial did a great job. Theme and artwork on point, adaptive strategies, and great game play. I really enjoyed it!\u201d - Landon (How Lou Sees It) Squire\nThis project is promoted by Jellop, a direct\u00ad response online advertising agency specializing in Kickstarter campaigns on Facebook Ads and Google AdWords.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is North Star Games\u2019 fourth Kickstarter campaign associated with the Evolution product line, so we have an idea of some of the pain points for a campaign of this type.\n\nWith Evolution being North Star\u2019s first video game, we wanted to be sure we could deliver at the level we want before coming to Kickstarter. We've seen too many video games promise release dates and blow far past them. For this reason, we wanted to make sure we had the core gameplay done before coming to Kickstarter and showing it off to fans. \n\nOur final release target is mid 2018. There are many things that can affect how long the game will have to remain in beta for though. Multiple stages of testing and implementation of the feedback we receive takes some time and we don\u2019t want to rush it for the sake of deadlines. Our primary goal is quality, not a deadline.

The player must explore and survive to discover the truth of their mysterious arrival and unknown past. Inhabiting this surreal world, meeting its bizarre denizens, and solving its riddles will unravel not only your own story, but unlock Torla\u2019s many secrets and tangled history.\nYou wake up on the beach of a strange island...\nA mysterious figure appears to you, leaving supplies for your survival.\nYou must harvest and inhabit the environment:\nCraft tools and build structures to make life more fun:\nGrow things for food or pleasure:\nCatch things that lurk within Torla waters:\nMake friend or foe with Torla's majestic fauna:\n Be a helpful neighbor to your fellow Torla-dwellers:\n Solve puzzles throughout the land:\n There's much to be done both day and night:\n And each season holds unique and greater challenges:\nThe rules don't really apply in the land of Torla, and nothing is quite what it seems...\nThe shortest path isn't always the quickest, and exploration may take you in unexpected directions.\nThis strange and whimsical place carries its secrets between many disconnected dimensions, but if there's anything that's clear, it's that something important awaits at the end of this twisting path, and that nothing should be taken for granted.\nBut what about some specifics?:\n  PLAY\n\n    And just like Qora before it, Torla's soundtrack will be integral to the mood and beauty of the adventure. So if you're curious about the soothing sounds that will fill the silence of the Torla landscape, here's a sample:\n  Now that you know some stuff about the game, here's what you need to know about how it's being made and why we're using Kickstarter. \n  Holden divides his time between video games and filmmaking. He released his first PC title, Qora, in 2014, then spent the next year and-a-half making a film in the deserts of Death Valley, California. \nSince Qora's release, Holden has traveled all over the U.S. and China making films and working with a number of programmers on small game projects. Currently located in Boulder, CO, Holden spends his time working on Torla as his two cats, Ponyo and Oupian, watch from the couch. \nHe is the designer, writer, illustrator, animator, and composer for Torla.\nAmir is a spunky L.A. native who spends his days bringing the world of Torla to life, one line of code at a time. Despite his young age, he is extremely passionate about game development and has seven years of experience making games, holds a consistent 5-star satisfaction rating for his freelance work on Upwork, and has even garnered recruiting attention from Fortune 500 companies like Apple and Disney Interactive.\nInspired by classic games like Ron Gilbert\u2019s \u201cMonkey Island\u201d and contemporary atmospheric works like Capybara\u2019s Superbrothers: Sword and Sworcery, Amir was attracted to Torla\u2019s unique blend of traditional point and click controls, RPG mechanics, and quirkiness of Holden\u2019s distinct hand-drawn illustrations.\nHe decided to join Holden back in December 2016, and the two have been working on the project together remotely ever since.\nWell... Holden found Amir in December of 2016, at which they immediately began development on what was to be a short teaser trailer for Torla.  They planned out a few months to create enough content to launch a Kickstarter campaign.\nHowever, very quickly they both fell in love with the project and decided to put the next six months into creating a rich and beautiful world that would be unlike any other. \nWith Amir on the verge of starting his college career, the two were determined to build as much of the game as possible before he had to devote his time to preparing for school at the end of June. \nWith their ideas and designs becoming deeper and more magical each month, they knew that Torla would need a much longer time to develop and truly blossom into the beautiful baby they envisioned. \nToday, Torla is a functioning game with a lot of its foundation completed, its chapters largely prepared, and a few handfuls of pretty places to roam around in, but without the scrutiny and polishing it needs to be presented to the world as a playable piece. \nWe've worked for six months now to prepare a first look at our vision for Torla, and hope it piques your imagination enough to support it here on Kickstarter!\n  Here's the plan:\nTorla's story is told in 3 chapters. Each Chapter will be released separately along with a Prologue and Epilogue. \nWe need to raise the funds to develop the First Chapter which we believe will take about 5 months (minimum) to finish. \nWe'd like to take the time to perfect Torla's foundational code, create a ton of its universal artwork, and have plenty of room to make sure Chapter 1 is absolutely incredible before we release it upon the world. That way, Chapter 2 and 3 will be smooth sailing afterwards. \nWe estimate that all 3 chapters will take about year total to develop, with some added breaks in between chapters. \nA year of hardcore game development requires money, of course!\nMostly, we need to eat, drink, and shelter ourselves during the game-making process. However, there's also a couple things we need to pay for at certain points in development. \nTake a look at this fancy chart that breaks it all down:\nSo why are we only asking for the funds for Chapter 1? \nWe believe that the most important part of any large creative project is getting it started. Once the funds are in place for our team to be together creating Torla full-time, there's no stopping us from that point forward.\nWe are extremely confident that once Torla makes it onto the marketplace, it will both fund itself, and attract enough support to carry it through to the finish line. (And don't worry, we have extra fallbacks, just in case!)\nPLAY\n\n However... if by a stroke of well-deserved luck, Torla's Kickstarter Goal of $36,000 is met with time to spare, we will keep charging forward in hopes to fund Chapter 2 and Chapter 3!\nThat's right folks, for an additional $27,000 each, we will be able to fund the development of the remaining 2 chapters and finish the game!!!\n  PLAY\n\n  Oh. You'd like something in return for your support?... \nOK! Here's the stuff we wanna give you for helping us make Torla (See the actual Rewards options for more details):\nSee anything you like? We don't want our backers to feel like they're just \"pre-purchasing\" the game, but have access to awesome stuff that you can only get by backing the campaign.\nPLAY\n\n  We will not only be creating awesome content on a regular basis, but will be spoiling you with it via Kickstarter Updates, Twitter Posts, and our Mailing List. \nSo whether or not you decide to support the game here on Kickstarter, keep checking back for new artwork, levels, characters, and other material that we'll be posting during the campaign. \n      ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nMaking a game takes time.

With a groundbreaking job system that combined the usual character classes like knights, thieves, and mages with offbeat classes such as chemists, dancers, and bards, the game appeared to be a shoo-in for North American distribution. But the game was dubbed \"too hardcore\" for a Western audience and was swapped out with Final Fantasy Mystic Quest, a simplistic new game tailor-made for Americans.  \nThat didn't stop a teenage Chris Kohler from tracking down Final Fantasy V. The young RPG fan got a Japanese copy of the game, used it to teach himself Japanese, and with the help of some internet companions created the first-ever comprehensive English-language FAQ of the game. As the internet narrowed the cultural gap between the East and West more each year, the game was eventually translated into English for the PlayStation, Game Boy Advance, and iOS. \nFans in the West finally got to learn what all the fuss was about. Now the acclaimed author of Power-Up and an editor at Kotaku, Kohler is revisiting the game that started his career in games journalism. Based on new, original interviews with Final Fantasy V's director, Hironobu Sakaguchi, as well as previously untranslated interviews with the rest of the development team, Kohler's book weaves history and criticism to examine one of the Final Fantasy series's greatest and most overlooked titles.\nRead an early excerpt at Kotaku and listen to the author talk about the game on this recent episode of Retronauts.\nChris Kohler is the author of Power-Up: How Japanese Video Games Gave the World an Extra Life, and the founding editor of Game|Life, the Webby-nominated video game section of WIRED. He is currently Features Editor of Kotaku, and lives in the San Francisco Bay Area. \nShovel Knight by David L. Craddock\nIn 2014, Yacht Club Games released its very first game, Shovel Knight, a joyful 2D platformer that wears its NES influences on its sleeve. This unlikely pastiche of 8-bit inspirations manages to emulate the look, feel, and even the technical limitations of nostalgic titles like Mega Man, Zelda II, and Castlevania III\u2014imbued with a contemporary sense of humor and self-awareness. But how is a fundamentally retro game created in the modern era? And what do the games of the past have to teach today's game designers?  \nBased on extensive original interviews with the entire Yacht Club Games team, writer David L. Craddock unearths the story of five game developers who worked so well together while at WayForward Games that they decided to start their own studio. From the high highs of Shovel Knight's groundbreaking Kickstarter to the low lows of its unexpectedly lengthy development, Boss Fight presents a new master class in how a great game gets made. Get ready to steel your shovel and dig into this fascinating oral history. For Shovelry!\nDavid L. Craddock lives with his wife and business partner in Ohio. He is the author of Stay Awhile and Listen, a three-part series that chronicles the history of World of WarCraft developer Blizzard Entertainment and Diablo/Diablo II developer Blizzard North; Break Out: How the Apple II Launched the PC Gaming Revolution by Schiffer Publishing; and HERITAGE, a young adult fantasy novel. Connect with David on Twitter or Facebook.\nNBA Jam by Reyan Ali\nWhen NBA Jam dunked its way into arcades in 1993, players discovered just how fun basketball can be when freed from rules, refs, and gravity itself. But just a few years after Midway's billion-dollar hit conquered the world, Midway, home version publisher Acclaim, and even video arcades themselves fell off the map. How did a simple two-on-two basketball game become MVP of the arcade, and how did this champ lose its title?  \nJournalist Reyan Ali dives deep into the saga, tracking the people and decisions that shaped the series. You'll get to know mischievous Jam architect Mark Turmell, go inside Midway's Chicago office where hungry young talent tapped into cutting-edge tech, and explore the sequels, spin-offs, and tributes that came in the game's wake.\nBuilt out of exhaustive research and original interviews with a star-studded cast -- including Turmell and his original development team, iconic commentator Tim Kitzrow, developers and executives at Midway and Acclaim alike, secret characters George Clinton and DJ Jazzy Jeff, Atari founder Nolan Bushnell, Doom co-creator John Romero, and 1990s NBA demigods Glen Rice and Shaq -- Ali's NBA Jam returns you to an era when coin-op was king.\nFollow Reyan's progress on Twitter at @nbajambook.\nReyan Ali is a writer from Columbus, Ohio. He\u2019s been published by Wired, Rolling Stone, Spin, The Atlantic, Pacific Standard, and alt-weekly papers across the country. Born in Dallas, he grew up in Karachi, Pakistan, where he soaked up 1990s NBA action almost exclusively through trading cards, Beckett Basketball back issues, and NBA Jam: Tournament Edition on the Sega Mega Drive. His first writing gig was contributing to the Mortal Kombat Netherealm (MKNe), a fan site long lost to time. At MKNe in 2000, he scored his very first interview: GamePro editor Dan Elektro. Over a decade later, he interviewed Elektro once more -- this time for NBA Jam, his first book. \nStar Wars: Knights of the Old Republic by Alex Kane\nSet in an even longer time ago in a galaxy far, far away, BioWare's 2003 RPG Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic wowed Jedi and Sith Lords alike with its compelling characters, lightsaber customization, complex morality choices, and one of the greatest plot twists in video game history. Among the droids and blasters, the game delves into themes like choice, free will, and the construction of identity and memory.\nFeaturing brand new interviews with Lead Designer James Ohlen and Senior Writer Drew Karpyshyn, game critic Alex Kane's book unveils how this classic game was made, analyzes KotOR's worldview through the lens of philosophy, mythology, and the ethics of war, and investigates how the game borrows techniques from contemporary films like The Sixth Sense and Fight Club. Whether you align with the light or the dark side, you're invited to dive into this fun and thoughtful exploration of the most beloved Star Wars game of all time.\nYou can read an early excerpt of the book here.\nAlex Kane is a freelance journalist and critic based in west-central Illinois. His work has appeared in Glixel, Kill Screen, the website of Rolling Stone, StarWars.com, and elsewhere.\nPostal by Brock Wilbur & Nathan Rabin\nIn 1997, game studio Running with Scissors released its debut title, Postal, an isometric shooter aimed at shocking an imagined pearl-clutching public. The game focused on a disgruntled \"Postal Dude\" whose goal is to murder as many people as possible. It was crass, gory, and dumb\u2014all of which might have been forgivable if the game had been any fun to play.  \nPostal gained enough notoriety from riding the wave of public outrage to warrant a sequel. And DLC. And a remake. And, perhaps most surprising of all, a Golden-Raspberry-winning feature film adaptation directed by the infamous Uwe Boll.  \nIn this thoughtful and hilarious tag-team performance, comedian Brock Wilbur & media critic Nathan Rabin mine the fascinatingly troubled game and film for what each can tell us about shock culture & mass shootings, interviewing the Scissors team and even Boll himself for answers. Like it or not, Postal is the franchise that won't die\u2014no matter how many molotov cocktails you throw at it.\nBrock Wilbur is a writer and comedian from Kansas who now lives in Los Angeles. He lives with his wife Vivian and their cat, Cat. He is the author of a forthcoming book about growing up with a adopted Bosnian brother, and an investigative journalism piece where he exposes a cult that has haunted the east coast since the late 70s.\nNathan Rabin is the former head writer of The A.V Club and a staff writer for The Dissolve as well as the author of six books, including The Big Rewind (Scribner), My World of Flops (Scribner), Weird Al: The Book (with Al Yankovic) (Abrams) and most recently 7 Days in Ohio and Kanye & Trump for his own imprint, Declan Haven Books. He is also the proprietor, owner and editor-in-chief of his own website, Nathan Rabin\u2019s Happy Place. He lives in Decatur, Georgia with his wife, dog Ghostface Killah, and son Declan.\nEach campaign, backers get a chance to decide the subject of one of our upcoming books. Thanks to our supporters, we've published fan-selected books on Chrono Trigger and Shadow of the Colossus, and last season's choice Final Fantasy VI is planned for future release. Now it's time for you to pick the next fan-selected Boss Fight Book.\nWhen you back the campaign, hit the comments section and name the game you most want to read a book about. Then, in the final week of the campaign, we're going to tally all the games mentioned and create a shortlist of 3-4 finalists, and you can vote once more on the finalists. From there, we'll put out a call for book pitches about that particular game, and choose the author who we think will write the best book.\nMay the best game win!\n  Since the series launch, Boss Fight Books has been written up in top-tier publications. Check out a small sample of our reviews for last season's books:\nOn Super Mario Bros. 3 (named one of author Dennis Cooper's Favorite Nonfiction Books of 2016): \"Super Mario Bros. 3 is worth a look, especially if that mustachioed plumber holds a place of reverence in your own nostalgic heart.\" - ZAM\nOn Mega Man 3: \"This is a fantastic book for anyone who is interested in the history of Mega Man, Nintendo in general, video game design, the Japanese gaming industry, nostalgia, and excellent writing.\" - E.C. Myers\nOn Soft & Cuddly: \"[...] a love note to all things grungy and bootleg, to everyone who managed to succeed despite standing in their own way.\" - Heavy Feather Review\nOn Kingdom Hearts II: \"[I]t's Alexa's own personal story and attachment to the game's questions [...] that make up the hardest-hitting points of her critiques and analyses over the series. If this is the start to a new age of discussion over the series, I welcome it with an open heart.\" - Kingdom Hearts Insider\nYou can check out our Press page for more coverage, and read some reviews at Goodreads and Amazon.\nTry before you buy!

This is so that we can get you your copies of Final Fantasy V while still finishing up Katamari.\nSeptember 2017: Digital Kickstarter rewards arrive (Anthology, bonus eBooks, etc.).\nOctober 2017: First book, Final Fantasy V, arrives.

(Includes shipping in the U.S., with an additional $10 per book internationally.)\nAnd if you're new to Boss Fight, you could get the whole 22-book catalog for $100 (digital) or $400 (paperback + digital).\nIf you've been with Boss Fight awhile, we hope you'll take this opportunity to renew your subscription. Your support will allow us to keep Boss Fight publishing great books about classic video games, and you'll keep receiving each of our books before its public release.\nIf you're new to Boss Fight, we're glad you found us!

WOOHOO!!!  \nYou can check out my series at  \nYOUTUBE.COM/RAHDO  \nAs a sampler, here's a playlist of some recent runthroughs I've done (click \"playlist\" in the top left to see a long list of video choices):  \nI make these videos primarily as a way of sharing my enthusiasm and passion for the boardgaming hobby, and helping like-minded board game geeks choose which of the myriad games on the market are right for them.  \nBut as it happens, as of 2013, I've retired from full-time employment, and now, to be able to continue to produce runthrough videos, I need to raise funds to cover my operating expenses (game purchases, travel expenses to game conventions, and a salary to be able to stay devoted 100% to the show).  \nFan Support Makes it all Possible  \nThat's where you come in, because I receive no direct income for Rahdo Runs Through except for fan support in these yearly fund raising drives. I accept no payments from game developers for any game (retail or Kickstarter prototype) that I run through, and I don't turn on YouTube ads (because they're awful), so you folks are truly what keeps Rahdo running through! :)  \nBy backing this, my fifth RAHDO RUNS THROUGH Kickstarter campaign, you're funding my ability to continue to produce videos of all the latest, hottest games, ranging from the big games of the moment like Arkham Horror the Card Game and Gloomhaven, to the soon to be released hits like Pandemic Legacy Season 2 and Charterstone. \nJust a few of the many games that could be coming soon, with your help...\nIn return for your donation, you have access to a variety of rewards. What are they, you might be wondering? I'm glad you asked... \nTHE BACKER REWARDS \nRahdo Runs Through VOTING! Exclusive microbadges!\n  Custom signed stickers & game bags crocheted with love!\n  Lucky dip markers and waterjet meeples galore!\n  WITWAT? They're keeping an eye out for you!\n  Supersize your meeples!\n  Co-host or direct the show!\n  Secret Council Membership!\nSo what's all this then? Lucky Dips? Secret Councils? Directors? WITWAT? Don't worry, I've got you covered. Check out this video, which walks you through all the different options, including how the WILDCARD backing system works! :)\nTHE STRETCH GOALS \nOkay, so the target goal for this year basically covers all the new games I'll be acquiring to film, another trip to Essen for more convention coverage and a basic salary for me and Paulo Renato (the fine fellow who fact checks and annotates all my vids... Paulo is l'awesome and keeps me honest!). But, if we go above and beyond the target, below is some additional content that can be provided over the next 12 months! \nStretch Goal #1: Rahdo Talks Through, the Podcast ($35,000)  \nHitting this stretch goal means I'll continue my twice-Golden Geek Award-nominated podcast series where I talk about exciting upcoming games, revisit top10 topics to delve further, and answer plenty of questions (joined each month by Jen).\nYou can subscribe to the series here: http://podcast.rahdo.com\nStretch Goal #2: Jen Runs Through ($40,000) \nRahdo Runs Through is mostly a one-man show, but people do love it when my lovely wife Jen makes appearances to help me play and demonstrate the games (rather than my normal \"virtual\" Jen gaming partner!) \nOf course, it's time consuming to film runthroughs, and that takes her away from her actual career of making beautiful glass art. But, if we hit this 2nd stretch goal, Jen will commit to appearing in 12 runthroughs over the course of the year (roughly once each month), and I can tell you right now, the shows she's in are always the most fun to watch! \nTo give you an idea of what a Jen-enhanced video is like, here's a playlist of all the videos she's been in to date: http://jen.rahdo.com \nStretch Goal #3: Rahdo Runs Through LIVE! ($50,000) \nThis stretch goal is all about filming live game runthroughs (plus Q&A) every other month. Last year my schedule for these was a bit off, and I'm getting them all done this very month! So tune in on any given Saturday in April to join the fun.\nHere's a playlist of all the live events done so far to see what they're like! \nStretch Goal #4: Rahdo & Jen's top100!!! ($55,000)\nFolks have been asking for this literally for years now, and if we hit this stretch, Jen and I will finally buckle down and make a series of videos where we discuss both of our top 100 games of all time!  \n  \"Thanks for watching, talk to you later, so long, buh bye!\"\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI'm not really anticipating any particular challenges or risks - other than maybe laryngitis!

All copies are ready in our USA warehouse for immediate shipping! \n  Mothership takes the best elements from dice combat games and blends them into an easy to pick up, unpredictable and enjoyable gaming experience. It's light-hearted, engaging and the most fun you will have had rolling dice in ages!\nFeatured on:\nMothership is a tabletop dice combat game for 2 to 6 people. Players take turns moving ships, attacking other players, capturing planets and managing an economy.\nYour fleet is composed of three unique ship types, including the versatile Mothership that can modify its weapons, shields and engines on the fly.\nAll players start with the same fleet of ships on a balanced board that changes every time you play. Battles occur between ships using dice and players must protect their own base while attacking their enemy's base.\nTo get the edge over their opponents, players must capture planets and spend resources on upgrading a technology tree. The technology tree complements certain strategies and there is no bad choice. It all comes down to your ability to out-smart the enemy.\nMothership also throws a little chaos into the mix with Action cards! You can choose to put your money into chance or careful strategy... or both! \nMothership caters to a variety of play styles. You could choose to rely on chance and luck of the draw to win you the game. Perhaps you're the type of person who favors strategy and careful planning. Or perhaps deceit, betrayal and broken alliances are more your cup of tea? Whatever your play style, Mothership has you covered!\nMothership can also be played with alternative Victory Point rules for a fluid, faster paced experience!\n Features\nControl Panel: You can change your Mothership\u2019s stats every turn by managing energy.\nDynamic: The game board changes every time you play. You can create your own board layout using the asteroid tiles!\nBalance: All players have an equal chance, yet can choose from a wide range of tactics. \nEngaging: There\u2019s never a dull moment! You still have a chance of winning right up until you lose your last ship. \nTechnology Tree: Allows players to choose different tactics each time they play. \nAccessible: First time players can compete against veterans of dice combat games. Mothership can also be simplified for younger players by removing the tech tree while still being a ton of fun!\n    Game Pieces: 6x Colony Stations, 6x Motherships, 18x Fighters, 12x Bombers, 42x Capture Markers, 8x Planets, 50x Transparent stands\nPrinted: 1x Game board (20\"), 6x Mothership Control Panels, 6x Tech Trees, 92x Action cards, 30x Resource cards, 12x Artifact cards, 6x Victory Point cards, 10x Asteroid tiles, 12x Exploration Tokens\nCounters: 126x blue energy, 96x red HP, 24x grey\nDice: 1x D4, D6, D8, D10, D12 \nGame Pieces: 2x Colony Stations, 2x Motherships, 6x Fighters, 4x Bombers, 14x Capture Markers, 4x Planets, 18x Transparent stands \nPrinted: 8x Class cards, 4x Wormhole tiles, 8x Nebula tiles, 5x Action Cards\nDice: 1x Random Event D6\nWhat's New in the Expansion Pack\nKickstarter Exclusive Black and Silver ships: Blow up space ships in style with these limited edition colours. Comes with matching capture markers.\nNebula tiles: Add another element to your board with Nebula tiles. Ships can only move a maximum of 1 space through nebula but won't take damage. This simple new element adds an entirely new layer of strategy when paired with...\nWormholes: Two way wormholes transport ships instantly to the other side creating new ways to play. Flip them over to reveal black Wormholes that can have more than one exit.\nClass Cards: Receive a random Class card at the beginning of the game to further specialize your fleet. Each card has a one-use action ability and technology upgrade that no one else has. With up to eight different Classes, there's something to suit any play style.\nPrevious Stretch Goals\nThe incredible support from our backers throughout the last campaign meant that we were able to reach some great stretch goals. You\u2019ll be happy to know, that most of the stretch goals unlocked in the last campaign will now be included in the initial funding goal for this campaign. This will mean...\nThe amazing three piece plastic tray will return!\nMothership features a beautiful way to store your ships.\n  The tray splits off into a card holder that you can use during the game.\nPlastic Capture Markers are also included in all colours, a significant upgrade from the original chipboard hexes.\nEven though they look edible...please do not eat the capture markers.\nPlanetary Exploration: Explore the planets you conquer! Uncover ancient alien artifacts that may help you overpower and annihilate your enemies. But be careful! The artifacts you discover are tied to the planet they were found on. If someone else captures your planet, that relic you worked so tirelessly to find will be transferred to them. You\u2019ll be forced to sit there and watch as they enjoy the perks of your discovery.\nEach planet has a unique artifact to discover.\nDouble-sided Board: Flip the game board occasionally to enjoy a change of scenery, as you gaze upon a fresh new starscape to battle it out on.\nBoth sides provide the same amount of hex spaces.\n Here's a great un-boxing video of the first edition by Epitrapaizoume.\n  Backstory\nThe great Space Disagreement of 5406 has forced your entire colony to flee into the dark depths of outer space. You\u2019re not alone. Other colonies too seek refuge from the war. All scramble to harvest the valuable resources on undiscovered planets. Your mission: destroy all other colonies. Diplomacy is boring. Shoot first, confirm if they were enemies later...\nThe Basics\n1. Move, 2. attack, 3. get planets, 4. get money and 5. buy upgrades.\nIf you didn't get a good idea of how to play from the video then you can also read the full rule book here!\nGame Play Video\nTantrum House also made a nice overview of the game.\nDynamic Game Board\nNever play the same game twice! Players are able to enjoy a great deal of versatility and unpredictability by setting up the asteroids in any layout they like. This feature of Mothership ensures that no two games need ever be the same. Some layout examples are included in the rule book, but many more ideas can be found by checking out the Board Layout page on the website.\n     Add the following amounts to your pledge if you wish to order add-ons.\n              Kickstarter surveys will be handled by BackerKit, which means you will have maximum flexibility to change your details and add-ons right up until our shipping date.\nMotheship has almost been stretched to the limit! That's why you will find most of the stretch goals are for the Into the Vortex expansion. Each goal states what it upgrades.\n  BGG Page - Launch Tweet - Facebook Launch Post - Facebook Page - BGG Artwork\nOut now on the Apple App Store and Google Play is an app designed to complement your ship exploding, dice rolling experience.\nApple App Store \u2013 Google Play\nHTML 5 Version: Dice Roller \u2013 Fleet Manager\nFleet Manager\nFleet Manager combines one player\u2019s Control Panel and Technology Tree into a single screen. Using the plus and minus buttons you can increase and decrease energy across your Mothership\u2019s subsystems. The Tech Tree also highlights when you upgrade your fleet and will only allow you to select one branch per tree. When you upgrade your blue Support tree to include extra Mothership energy, this automatically gets added to your Control Panel.\nIt doesn\u2019t end there though! As you\u2019re aware, the Tech Tree also adds buffs to the rolls of your Fighters or Bombers. Tap the dice button and you\u2019re taken to a personal dice roller that connects to your Tech Tree and automatically adds your buffs for you! This screen also sports a large area to display the current roll, roll history (up to four places) and buttons for regular dice.\nStand-Alone Dice Roller\nObviously each player in your gaming group may not have a device to run the app, so there is also a stand-alone Dice Roller which can be used for the entire table. This module features buttons for normal dice, the Random Event D6 and buttons that correspond to Fighter and Bomber rolls, their buffs and multiple ships attacking at once.\nWhat you should know before downloading: The app will run and look it\u2019s best on tablets. As requested by the community, I haven\u2019t restricted the app to any particular device type. \nThis means that you can download it to a phone if you wish. However, please keep in mind that the app was not originally designed for such a small screen space, and as such the buttons may be too small, and some of the text may be difficult to read clearly. I have done the best that I can to help with these issues by adding a zoom button. Please also note that I haven\u2019t restricted the app to new devices with the latest operating software, so if you run it on an older device, it may lag a little between the menus.\nFeatured on:\nRead or watch the reviews here:\nPolygon - Just Press Start - Geek and Sundry -Tantrum House - Game On\n  Thanks to our collaboration with three different shipping partners, we are able to offer customs-friendly shipping to the following regions: Europe, USA and Australia/New Zealand. Canadian packages will be sent from the USA but still shouldn't incur any customs charges.\nAll shipping will be calculated and charged after the campaign ends through BackerKit.\nBackerkit has a more robust shipping system than Kickstarter, meaning that we can ensure only the most accurate shipping prices are charged, while factoring in your pledge tier, all stretch goals and all add-ons. In the meantime, we can offer estimated shipping costs.\nBackers in Canada: We can offer customs-friendly shipping if we get 100 Canadian backers, so if you've been holding back, pledge now!\nBackers in Asia: Send me a message and I'll check the shipping cost to your country.\nWe apologise to those in countries where shipping is more expensive. Mothership is a massive, heavy game and we\u2019ve done our best to keep the prices as low as we possibly can. \nTo keep costs low, try getting some friends together and buy a 3-pack instead of making individual orders, you will be able to save on postage this way.\n  Peter Sanderson is the lead designer, artist and creator of Mothership. This is his greatest project ever and is the culmination of everything he loves about board games and science fiction.\nJust about everything you see on this page has been crafted by Peter, except for the following special thanks: Graeme, for the backing ukulele in the videos. Alkira and Nathan for their voice work in the launch trailer. Brendan, Bjorn and Bianca for being involved in filming and countless hours of playtesting.\nExtra special thanks goes to my wife Alkira, who encouraged me to waste a good chunk of my life making this game.\nAlso integral to the project this time around is Paul Johnson from Aetherworks Australia and Damon Mccarley.

Combine brutal biology, relentless robotics, mind-bending physics and volatile chemistry as you compete to become the most infamous monster-building scientist. The nefarious possibilities are almost endless\u2014the parts in one XYbrid deck can create more than half a billion different monsters. \nEach card is transparent, so building your monster is a creative experience unlike any other game\u2014and because each card has different art on either side, the path to ultimate infamy is always uniquely yours.\nGAMEPLAY\nPlayers take turns drawing parts from the Lab and using them to build monsters that will increase their infamy score. Each monster begins with a core part, and is complete when it has a head, two arms, and legs. Secret Breakthrough cards help players formulate strategies and unleash surprises each round\u2014will you go for brute force or cunning combinations?\u2014while Mission effects raise the stakes as the game goes on. After 3 rounds, the most infamous player wins!\nLearn all the rules with the digital guide, and watch the Learn-to-Play video:\n                          The spirit of the Brand-a-Bot pledge level is to let players put their personal, permanent mark on XYbrid by including their initials in a piece of card art. In science fiction, you often see arbitrary letters and numbers adorning robots and machines\u2014this is your chance to become those arbitrary letters and numbers! Here are the rules:\nYou submit a sequence of up to 3 letters and/or numbers with your survey after the end of the campaign. This can be your initials, or birthdate, or any creative, meaningful group of 3 alphanumeric characters. I handle everything from there. \nI reserve the right to reject a submission for any reason. Some reasons may include: offensive or suggestive content, trademarked content, submissions greater than 3 characters, submissions with special characters, etc. \nIf your submission is rejected, I will work with you to come to an acceptable alternative. \nStylistic choices such as color, font, and placement are at the discretion of the artist. Please know that the goal is to make your \u201cbrand\u201d large and bold (not to hide it within the art).\n  Transparent cards are what make XYbrid a uniquely visual gaming experience. Unfortunately, most manufacturers aren\u2019t equipped to produce transparent cards\u2014it requires special machines, inks, and material. Start to finish, the creation of a XYbrid deck is simply more expensive than it would be for standard paper cards. The basic pledge level of $29 helps cover the increased production cost of making something that looks and plays extra cool.\nThe funding goal of $14,500 is based on close and specific coordination with two manufacturers who provided quotes for producing XYbrid. After factoring in additional fees and shipping estimates, I believe this goal is the most realistic target that allows for a reasonable game price.\nThe pledge levels are simple by design. As this is my first foray into game production, I chose to focus on getting the game itself right, and avoid the added complexity of extra components, perks, or stretch goals. This strategy keeps cost down and removes distractions during the critical production and fulfillment phases.\nFor this project, shipped rewards will come from the United States. While I am happy to send copies of XYbrid anywhere in the world, I do not have distribution partners in Europe or Asia at this time. Please know that customs charges and value-added taxes (VAT) may arise but are different for every country and are the responsibility of the backer upon delivery.\nYou can find more details about manufacturing and delivery in the Risks and Challenges Section below.\n  ABOUT THE DESIGNER\nI'm Gabe. My day job is in graphic design and user experience. I get paid to create things people enjoy interacting with, and over the years I\u2019ve directed more than a few projects that required unusual art production\u2014hence my confidence in bringing a transparent card game to life. I'm committed to understanding how players consume fun\u2014I study what motivates people to engage with, learn, and solve problems; then I use that knowledge to make stuff.\nI've been concocting game ideas since I was a kid, but XYbrid is my first public game design. It grew from my love of modular creativity (my childhood was all Mega Man and Lego) and my love of mind-blowing, weird science. In fact, many XYbrid cards are inspired by real-life scientific concepts.\nMy favorite tabletop games are quick to play, but allow for deeper strategy to develop as players learn. XYbrid was designed, developed, and tested over 4 years to provide this type of play experience, built around a unique visual style. My hope is that Kickstarter will bring people like me together to make this quirky, creative game a reality.\n   ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nMANUFACTURING\nThe concept and vision for XYbrid has been vetted by two proven, global game manufacturers. The vendor I am planning to use for manufacturing is located in Hong Kong, and has assured me that their company can accomplish the printing of two-sided transparent plastic cards. Producing XYbrid as I have described above is contingent on their word and ability.\n\nThe production process will begin almost immediately after funding. With the exception of adjustments for the Brand-a-Bot pledge level, the art for all 116 cards (and the rulebook) is already finished. Box art is nearly finished as well, needing only to be transferred into a technical format for manufacturing.\n\nTIMING\nMy delivery target is November 2017.\n\nThe process for review and approval of products manufactured in Asia can take weeks. I have accounted for a reasonable amount of back-and-forth in the timeline, but errors and/or misunderstandings resulting in unforeseen rounds of revision can extend the production timeline and delay delivery. International customs and/or changing international trade policies\u2014while completely out of my control\u2014can also impact timing and cost.\n\nAn overwhelming number of backers could require additional manufacturing or fulfillment coordination which may also delay delivery.\n\nSHIPPING\nBackers are asked to provide shipping information (and possibly other information, depending on pledge level) promptly after a successfully funded campaign. Providing inaccurate shipping information may result in additional fees to correct.\n\nErrors can occur during shipping, such as lost or damaged items. In such cases, backers can contact me to arrange for replacement items.\n\nBy placing a pledge, you affirm that you\u2019ve read and understand the Risks and Challenges section.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Honorary Scientist", "descp": "Receive a heartfelt thanks and a powerful sense of superiority as you achieve honorary XYbrid Scientist status.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Apr 2017"}], "stat": ["23 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 29 or more", "title": "XYbrid Game", "descp": "Enjoy one copy of XYbrid in full transparent, monstrous glory.

Select your hero by combining two character options: your role and race. Your role is your profession and your race is your species. This combination drives your hero's strengths, weaknesses, and defines your special abilities. You'll use dry erase markers (or print your own high quality hero sheets) to keep track of your hero's strength.\nTravel across the map earning power-ups by completing quests and battling opponents of multiple types. Move carefully to avoid many dangers and travel from city to city, visiting shrines and ruins along the way.\nGain power quickly, for the Dead King also moves... he destroys the cities while you frantically gather the power necessary to stop him. For each city the Dead King destroys, he gains more power.\nThe object of HEXplore It is to power up your heroes as quickly as possible, to eventually defeat the Dead King himself. The game is won if you confront and defeat him, bringing light back to the Valley.\nCan you save the Valley from the Dead King?\n  Game Features\nCooperative game play\nFantasy-themed hero building\nVariable hero powers and combinations\nOrganic & customizable hero advancement\nModular board\nThousands of potential map layouts\nMap built to interlock with future expansions\nStrategic movement\nExploration & questing\n40+ unique combat scenarios\nDice-rolling & press-your-luck scenarios\nDynamic play duration\nCustomizable game difficulty\n Play Styles\n  Social Media links: \n           We\u2019ve built dozens of Roles and dozens of Races for HEXplore It, and we\u2019re far from finished. The Core Game began with 6 of each, but our community has unlocked more. We\u2019re hoping to bring you all 720 Hero Combinations! \nAs we reach our goals, we\u2019ll be able to unlock even more combinations, which will be included in every game.\n  The Roles\nCreating your hero begins with selecting your role. Your role defines the part you\u2019ll play during the game. Each player mat is a durable dry erase board, and you\u2019ll use dry erase markers to keep track of your scores as you play the game.\n  There are five types of roles, based on what function they play in the game. The five types are: Assist, Healer, Sapper, Striker, and Utility.\nEach role will be printed double-sided on thick cardboard. The player card appears on the front and original artwork for each role on the back.\n   The Races\nAfter you select your role, you'll also select a race for your hero. Each race has modifiers that augment your role, offering a unique play experience each time you play a different combination.\nYou\u2019ll find differences in all of your stats, your Favored Enemy, Food Rating, and finally the special ability. Like the roles, our campaign begins with six races unlocked. \n Masteries & Special Abilities\nEach hero gains two masteries from their role, and a single racial ability based on their species. These abilities require a mix of health and energy to use. Most masteries are usable only in combat, but some can also be used outside of combat. Each mastery and racial ability are unique.\nLet\u2019s look at the Beast Master below. Combined with the wise Elf, the Beastmaster could affect the Circumstances in play. By choosing the stubborn Dwarf for instance (as seen below), this Beastmaster could force the group to Wander. As you explore the game you\u2019ll want to experiment with all sorts of fun combinations.\n Roles & Races in the Core Box\n  How are we going to pick which Role is unlocked next?\nWe aren\u2019t. You are!\nThe portal below has been activated! If you've backed the project, you can step through to vote on your favorite role for each of the five types. When a new role is unlocked, we\u2019ll consult the poll to select the one with the most votes.\nCheck the backer-only update labeled: \"The portal is now open!\" for the password to enter.\n     How will the Races be unlocked?\nEach race has been assigned to a specific role, and for purposes of the artwork we\u2019ll be creating for each. When a new role is unlocked, a new race will be unlocked along with it.\n  Can I purchase the extra heroes that haven't been unlocked yet?\nYes! We've now included an optional add-on for you to purchase all of the roles and races that have been prepared for HEXplore It. We've done this because of the overwhelming requests and we feel it will only help the campaign. For more detail, check out the Add On section below.\n Exclusive Kickstarter Only Races\nAll six of the exclusive races have been unlocked! The exclusive race cards are more powerful than their normal counterparts, and will not appear in this form in other versions of the game! \n   The Battle Mat\nLike the role cards, you'll use dry erase markers to keep track of your opponents' vitals. In addition to this, you can use the Battle Mat to keep track of various group effects and bonuses. \n   Bosses\nBosses are the most difficult opponents your Heroes will face. They offer substantial rewards to your group, which will help prepare your heroes to face the last boss: the Dead King. There are five double sided cards for a total of ten bosses in the game.\n  The Bandit Prince\n   Game Play and Market Cards\nIn addition to the boss cards shown above, the Core Box contains four game play cards: the Game Aid, the City/Market card, the Black Market/Market card, and the Shrine/Ruin card. \n   A Modular Map\nHEXplore It features a modular game board that changes with each play through. Four main quadrants can be positioned in dozens of ways before the game begins, which affects both the players and the Dead King. Create impassible terrain by rotating the quadrants in any way you choose.\nAs soon as the group reaches the edge of the map, reveal a random extension called a \u201cHEX Tile\u201d. These extensions may contain Quests, Ruins, Bosses, or Shrines.\nIn addition to the quadrants and hex tiles, the game features a Circumstance mat and Quest mat, and several location markers. Each mat is made of two interlocking pieces that fit into both the top and bottom of the game board. The markers are hexagon shaped pieces that designate various game locations.\n Punchboards in the Core Box\n  Here are a few of the many quadrant setups:\nWe're also including several small connector pieces, to help close any gaps or build some narrow bridges in your terrain. These are an optional addition to your game.\n   The Circumstance Deck \nThis deck is full of interesting scenarios, deadly afflictions, magical trinkets, combat encounters and more! Each game turn, a player will roll a six-sided die to determine the Circumstance they\u2019ll experience that turn.\nThe Circumstance mat is composed of two interlocking pieces that affix to the top of the game board. Players draw five cards from the Circumstance Deck and place them face up in the slots marked 1-5. During the Circumstance phase of the game turn, one player will roll a six sided die. The result becomes the Circumstance the players will face this turn. If you roll a six during the Circumstance phase, you\u2019ll draw a card blindly from the deck. \n   The Quest Deck\nThis deck is full of Quests the group can attempt to accomplish in order to gain access to the Power Up deck. There are seven types of cards in the Quest deck: Navigate, Explore, Survival, Arcs, Escort, Invasion, and Bounty. Quests are written in a short story format, adding flavor to your game.\nLike the Circumstance mat at the top of the board, the Quest mat lays out at the bottom of the game board. Here players will find five active Quests to complete. You\u2019ll also find the Wander graphic on the Quest mat. You\u2019ll use this whenever the group wanders off course.\n   The Power Up Deck\nThe Power Up Deck is full of cards that increase your hero\u2019s statistics. You\u2019ll gain access to this deck as you complete quests, defeat difficult encounters, bosses, and explore ruins. Strengthen your heroes as quickly as you can, or the Dead King will outpace you and conquer the valley!\n   The Dead King's Deck\nHEXplore It also features a One vs. All play style, where one player takes on the role of the Dead King. Mess with the heroes and attempt to wreak havoc on their campaign to destroy you! Each turn you'll draw a card from your deck, slowly giving you more power to destroy them once and for all...\n  Card of the Day\nEach day we'll showcase a single card that appears in the game. Stay tuned each day to check them out!\n                                     Check out our library of ever-growing videos below. You'll be able to see previews, reviews, and even entire play-throughs of the game. Thanks for checking them out!\n                               HEXplore the Rulebook\n           We'll be using Pledge Manager at the end of the campaign, which will allow you to manage your pledge details after the campaign ends!\nWe'll be using Pledge Manager!\n  Heroes of HEXplore It: Digital Download\nThe Heroes of HEXplore It PDF will be a full color booklet that contains artwork and short stories featuring many of our roles and bosses. Many of the short stories are currently featured on our website. \nWe can't quite tell you how many pages we'll have in the book, as that will depend partially on how many roles we'll manage to unlock during the campaign. We can tell you the book will contain at least 20 pages.\n Core Box\nThe Core box contains all items shown on the \"Core Box\" graphic at the top of the page. As we unlock our stretch goals, the Core game will gain more content! Each Core Box will contain the extra content unlocked in our stretch goal section.\nPhoto Prints\nWe'll be printing 8\"x12\" photographs of the Dead King and Cryovern artwork, and our artists will sign them! You can find a higher resolution version to gander at on our website. We hope you like them as much as we do!\n  Role & Race Sponsorships\nAt the end of the campaign our Diplomats and Wardens will select either a role or race (depending on the pledge selected). These may be selected from the unlocked OR locked lists. If the selection is from the locked list, this hero will be added to the game for everyone. They will become the sponsor for this hero and their name will be added to the Thank You backers sheet as the hero's sponsor.\nItem Creation\nAt the end of the campaign, our Smugglers will work closely with us to create a unique item for purchase or acquisition in the game. They'll select the function and suggest a name and we'll work with them to make the item a reality.\nThe Forests of Adrimon (Beta Version)\nOur follow up to The Valley of the Dead King is currently in the tinkering phase of production. We have a working map and several interesting augmentations to the rules planned. Our Seers will obtain the beta version and will have the chance to provide feedback.\n  Interested in more stuff? Check out these addons we\u2019ve prepared for the campaign. How do addons work? If you\u2019re interested in purchasing any of these extras, simply add the amount shown below to your pledge during the checkout process.\nExtra Games: $54 per game\nInterested in purchasing more than 1 game? We've decided to take $5 off each extra that you purchase. Each additional game costs $54.\nAll Heroes + 6 sided dice: $30 per game\nInterested in upgrading your game to include ALL of the Roles and Races we've prepared? Now you can do so. This add-on INCLUDES the six-sided die upgrade (which will help us organize the number of products we're creating). \nYour box will now contain 1 set of each hero in the game. Please be advised that as we reach our final stretch goals, the number of Roles & Races in the core game will increase.\nThe price of this addon includes the added cost of limited production runs (which is higher due to smaller print numbers) and the additional artwork required to put all of the Roles in the box. We hope that you consider this an investment in the product to help power up the brand and enhance your play experience.\n6 Extra 6-sided Dice: $6\nHEXplore It comes with one 6-sided die. This die is shared between all players and is generally not rolled at the same time during the game. We\u2019ve played hundreds of games, and have found that you only need one six-sided die to play. However, we\u2019re excited to offer more. The six-sided die that ships with the game features a unique hex digit and won\u2019t be available elsewhere.\nLimited to one set of 6 dice per backer. This addon cannot be combined with the Extra Heroes addon shown above.\nStudio Canvas Print: $75\nCheck out these premium canvas prints of the Dead King and Cryovern! Each canvas costs $75. The prints are sized 11\" tall by 16.5\" wide x 1\" thick. Each print comes ready to hang on the wall. \nYou will have the option of receiving the print with your game (which will reduce or eliminate the shipping cost) or in a separate shipment before the game arrives. If you choose to receive the print before the game ships, you'll be responsible for the shipping cost. \nThe exclusive card that was originally available with each canvas is now included in the base game and will not ship with the canvases.\n             Retailers\nThank you for your checking out the first installment of HEXplore It.

I know there will be challenges ahead of varying scope. \n\nI've done a great deal of research and feel prepared for whatever hiccups we might encounter. The wealth of information that Jamey Stegmaier has provided in his Kickstarter lessons have been very insightful! A very heart-felt thank you to you Jamey!\n\nI've prepared two production scenarios to ensure you'll receive the best product. Obviously our goal is to get you the most polished product we can. \n\nThe greatest risk to this campaign are delays in getting the final product to you within the time frame we're planning. Many projects tend to draw on much longer than project creators anticipate. To help reduce production delays, our goal is to finalize the production files for printing within 3 months of the Kickstarter's completion.\n\nIn conclusion, I have researched dozens of Kickstarter projects, several of which were successful and similarly several of which have failed. I can tell you now none of us are sure how this project will evolve. But our promise is this: we will be here the entire time to address concerns and issues as they crop up. \n\nPersonally, I've backed campaigns that were less than punctual in getting back to their backers and I hated it. I promise to keep you informed. Your pledge symbolizes trust. I've created this project because I am excited, and my hope is that you've backed this project for the same reason. I will do my very best to ensure that excitement continues throughout this journey.\n\nI am very grateful to you, for considering this project and for placing your trust in me.

Are you ready to see what might really be going on inside our insides?\nIn February 2016, we introduced Kickstarter and the world to Book 1 of our quirky concept. Now, we've returned to continue the adventures of college student Morgan as his body parts struggle to keep him alive, find purpose in life, and work together as a community. The great thing about this series is each book is a stand-alone story. You don't have to read Book 1 to understand what's going on in Book 2!\nIn Book 1 (40 pages of story), we saw Morgan's brain operator, Bran, and penis operator, Pepe, go head-to-head for control of Morgan's decision-making, all while Morgan battled the pressure to end a dry spell. You can enjoy a 15-page preview of Book 1 here!\nIn Book 2 (also 40 pages of story), things remain equally embarrassing, hilarious and awkward for Morgan. Except this time, we're exploring different body elements. Check out the Book 2 preview below! And make sure to check out our rewards options.\n            That's right, Morgan is in a sticky situation yet again. And if you've read Book 1, you know we'll deliver on that promise. Here's a couple more pages in progress.\n    Morgan's Organs is the wild brain child of me - Daniel Brodie - AKA Canadian #1. I'm excited to continue to partner with the incredibly talented artist, Robert Jennex - AKA Canadian #2 - who's handling all art for the book. We're a small team, but we've done it before, and we're ready to do it again.\nLeft - Dan; Right - Rob\nWe have exciting guest artists who've drawn beautiful rewards for this campaign. See the REWARDS section to check out what they produced.\nBenjamin Mackey, co-creator of the Image Comics series, SAINTS. His poster \"Last Supper\" is available at the \"ORGANISM\" tier.\nGreg Merritt, Canadian artist. His poster \"Incredible Meats\" is available at the \"ORGANISM\" tier.\nStady One, German illustrator, who drew the Book 2 collector's sleeve available at the \"ORGAN\" tier.\nThis series focuses on Morgan as he navigates everyday college life, which is made difficult by the fact that he isn't completely \"human\". Inside his body lives a variety of organ-like characters (called organauts) who control his various body systems and ultimately, are keeping him alive. The problem is these organauts don't always operate with the best interests of their host in mind.\nThe stories take place on two levels. Outside, we follow Morgan and his group of friends as they navigate college life. Zoom into his insides and we see how Morgan's struggles are made worse by a group of organ operators who bicker, lie, cheat, argue, act selfish, and generally, don't work together as one community.\nSay cheese!\n  Make sure to read the below highlights about our rewards.\nOnto the REWARDS!\nBelow is a snapshot of the various reward tiers and the added item available at each tier. You can also click the below image to read a PDF version. See the REWARDS tab for full details of what's available at each tier.\nClick to view PDF version\n  I believe in complete transparency because I don't see this as a business - not yet, at least. These campaigns are part of my long-term vision to have Morgan's Organs picked up by a publisher, and eventually made as a television series. All of my rewards are priced appropriately to cover exactly what I need to support this vision. That means covering artist salary, production (including printing), and packaging/shipping.\nIn the KS campaign for Book 1, we raised ~$5,500 from over 175 backers (140% of funding goal). As I committed to spending up to $1,000 CAD of my own money on this project (if needed), I invested in a larger print run of Book 1 which drove down the per-unit-cost and created the opportunity to grow readership. I also invested in an Artist Alley booth at Toronto's Fan Expo 2016, where I was able to bring in many more interested fans. Overall, my personal spending on Book 1 was about $700 CAD.\nI pay my artist what I am able, but we both have a mutual understanding this is a partnership and we're investing in a long-term vision. For Book 1, Rob received about $3,700 for all project work. This included a bonus payment for all his hard work after the entire project was done, based on what I could afford.\nFor this book, Rob will be receiving about $4,000, and if we're able to exceed our campaign goal by enough, I hope to increase his page rate further. I will invest up to $1,250 CAD of my own money into this project above what is raised, whether it goes towards printing, artist costs, or having a booth at an upcoming event.\nOur Kickstarter goal of $4,000 CAD supports the below:\n60% = artist salary\n30% = the 4P's - printing / production / packaging / parceling (shipping)\n10% = Kickstarter fees\nEverything raised above this goal will go to a combination of:\nAdditional printing (further driving down per-unit-cost and creating opportunity to invest in our stretch goal rewards)\nIncreasing artist salary\nConvention booths at 2017 Toronto Fan Expo and perhaps more!\nThis isn't just another comic book; it's a long-term vision. I have over 15 future stories planned (and counting), plus spin-off versions of the concept. The end goal is to produce Morgan's Organs as a television show, but until then, we'll continue to make great books, grow our audience, and look at the human body in weird, wacky ways! Thank you for helping us achieve our dream!\nPepe gives you approval to back this campaign!\n  Hey, what are you doing all the way down here? Still not convinced this book is right for you? Then read some of the past coverage we've received on Book 1 of the series!\nComic Crusaders - 5/5 star rating - \"Daniel lays out a wonderful story that I, no WE, need to read more of! The art is great, Robert brings to life the world of Morgan\u2019s organs with a clean, animated style.\"\nComixBrew - \"Morgan\u2019s Organs is the kind of comic that is good to show your buddies for the laughs but also contains a deceptive amount of depth.\"\nComic Plug - \"Morgan\u2019s Organs is like Inside Out if it were written by Seth McFarlane.\"\nComic Unknown - \"If you ever wondered how Inside Out would have worked through the eyes of a male college student, look no more. Morgan's Organs is a gut-busting comedy that while the idea has been seen before, it is the fresh take we need and want.\"\nOther Worlds Than These - \"The main thing this book really has going for it is the fact it\u2019s laugh out loud funny in places. It\u2019s also intelligently written and brings out real nostalgia.\"\nThe Outhousers - \"The delightfully cartoonish art and exploration of maturity help [Morgan's Organs] defy expectations. It's a satisfying read for those that love thoughtful comedy.\"", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have the experience from running a Kickstarter campaign for Book 1 to know how to deliver on our promise.

There are options for competitive, cooperative, and solo play!\nAt the start of the game, each player drafts his or her own team of four heroes and uses tactical movement and cardplay to overcome the dungeon's monsters and acquire treasures. Rival teams may compete with one another to slay monsters, or even battle one another for complete domination. \nOnly one Dungeon Alliance will prove victorious!\nDungeon Alliance may be played with or without player-vs-player combat at the players' discretion.  \n    Initial Goal - Funded!!\n  Unlocked!\n  Unlocked!\n  Unlocked!\n  Unlocked!\n  Soundly Defeated... and Unlocked!\n  Every copy of Dungeon Alliance includes:\n17 Hero Miniatures\n16 Colored Snap-On Bases\n25 Dungeon Tiles\n12 Board Frame Pieces\n17 Hero Cards\n51 Starting Deck Cards\n32 Generic Starting Cards (Basic Game)\n76 Upgrade Cards\n8 Reference Cards\n16 Solo / Cooperative Play Cards\n23 Encounter Cards\n64 Encounter Tokens\n40 Wound Tokens (Wood)\n208 Miscellaneous Tokens\n4 Draft Bonus Charts\n1 Dungeon Die\n12 Quest Cards (NEW!)\n12+ Campaign Tokens (NEW!)\n  We have now unlocked the Stretch Goal for the Deck of Many Treasures! Here are some details on how it will work:\nThe Deck of Many Treasures will be a separate deck of cards.\nWhenever a Hero opens a Treasure Chest or Locked Chest, he or she will have the option of either just receiving XP as normal, or \"digging deeper\" into the chest for an additional reward.\nIf a Hero pushes their luck by digging deeper, they will draw one of three types of cards:\nMagic Item: The Hero discovers a one-shot magical item that they can choose to use once per game. This card goes into the Alliance Deck, and is discarded immediately after use.\nTrap!: The Hero springs a trap. The Hero will have the opportunity to disarm the trap (rolling the Dungeon Die and using any special cards that help) to earn XP. If the Hero fails, they suffer the effects of the trap.\nMimic: The treasure chest springs to life and attacks! If the Hero can defeat the Mimic, he or she earns bonus XP. Otherwise, it will attack any Hero who approaches it for the rest of the game.\nWe can't wait for you to enjoy this exciting new feature that has been added to the Champions of Dungeon Alliance Expansion! As a Kickstarter Backer, it's yours for free the day you receive your game!\n  Thanks to the feedback of the Dungeon Alliance Community, we have added 12 Quest Cards that create an alternate source of XP during the game, as well as a way to earn Campaign Points that players can use to increase the strength of their dungeon parties over the course of several adventures!\nQuest Cards also provide a Win / Loss Condition for solo and cooperative games for those players who prefer an extra level of challenge!\nQuest Cards\nWe have included these new components and rules to the base game of Dungeon Alliance at no additional cost to backers! If the Kickstarter Campaign reaches its first goal, every copy of the game will include these new components.\n  Every Kickstarter backer receives the Champions of Dungeon Alliance Expansion for free! For a limited time, this expansion will only be available to Kickstarter backers. \nThe Champions of Dungeon Alliance Expansion includes the Hero Figures, Hero Cards, and Starting Deck Cards for four new Heroes, and also includes several new Upgrades. As we reach Stretch Goals, we may add even more elements to the expansion! But no matter how big it gets, it's all yours for FREE right now!\nBartholomew, Sonja, Kulldrak, and Taio\nYou will receive everything that ends up in the first expansion, except for the printed expansion box and rulebook. The rulebook will be downloadable to all backers in PDF format.\n  Every Kickstarter Backer will receive exclusive Epic Hero versions of the heroes from the game. Players who have drafted many cards for their favorite heroes can switch their Hero Cards out for these alternate art versions as a sign of the heroes' progress.\nAlthough these exclusive cards do not change the gameplay of Dungeon Alliance, they add a new level of immersion to the game. These Epic Hero cards are a special thank-you to our backers and will never be available after the Kickstarter campaign (except for charity events).\nAt the start of the campaign, there will be 5 Epic Hero Cards available for free to all backers. As we reach stretch goals, we will commission more art to add more free cards to the exclusive set!\nUPDATE: We have accomplished our first four Stretch Goals, and so now all 21 Epic Hero Cards have been unlocked and are included in the Kickstarter version of Dungeon Alliance!\nEpic Melinda, Jypzy, Petra, Taio, and Holgar\n    Our Dungeon Champion Pledge Level ($120) includes a full set of painted miniatures.

We begin with the Spanish text versions of the Rulebook and Rules Supplement\nDungeon Alliance Rulebook (Spanish)\nDungeon Alliance Rules Supplement (Spanish)\nForm Your Alliance\nAt the start of the game, each player drafts his or her own alliance of four heroes. This allows players to customize the type of team they'd like to play.\nYou will receive the Hero Card, Hero Figure, and 3 unique Starting Deck Cards associated with each of your heroes. Together, all 12 of your Starting Deck Cards form the basis of your personal Alliance Deck. Because of this, each player begins with a completely different Alliance Deck at the start of the game.\nBuild Your Deck\nAs you defeat monsters and overcome challenges, you will earn Experience Point Tokens (XP). You can flip these XP Tokens face down to purchase Upgrade Cards for your Alliance Deck.\nConquer the Dungeon!\nDuring each cycle of the game round, you will activate one of your heroes to move and attack monsters on the dungeon map. You will then have the opportunity to spend XP to purchase new upgrade cards that will go directly into your hand.\nAfter each of your opponents has moved a hero, you will each control one monster on the board to strike back at the heroes. The players control the monsters so that the monster attacks will be both strategic and meaningful.\nThere are four play cycles to each game round, after which the current round ends and the next round begins. At the end of the fourth game round, the Alliance that has acquired the most XP Tokens wins!\n    Our two main packages, Dungeon Ally ($80) and Dungeon Champion ($120), ship anywhere in the world.

We have 12 years of experience working with printers and resolving these sorts of issues, so we are fully prepared to face such difficulties if they arise.\n\nFor board games, a publisher on Kickstarter must also carefully calculate the shipping costs from the warehouse to the individual customers, or else they will face the possibility that they have not raised enough money to cover these expenses. We have made these calculations for shipping to our customers throughout the world.\n\nIn addition, in order for the game to be \"EU friendly,\" we will be shipping copies to our customers in the European Union from our printer's headquarters in Germany.
