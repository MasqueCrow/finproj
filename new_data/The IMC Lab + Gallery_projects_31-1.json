The first fully interactive museum designed for mobile devices. The UHHM is supported by Hip Hop legends Kurtis Blow, Afrika Bambaataa, Krayzie Bone, Ice T, Q Tip, Doug E. Fresh, Grandmaster Flash, MC Sha Rock and other luminaries from Hip Hop's 5 core elements. \nWe are seeking $75,000.00 to complete the design and engineering of the world's first mobile device powered virtual museum, to preserve, document, and guide the future of the world's most popular art form - Hip Hop! Your support will fund the creation of an advanced virtual museum for cultural arts, education, and entertainment!\nYour gift of membership makes the critical difference in our ability to carry out our mission to support, preserve and forward the evolution of Hip Hop culture. Join us today as a partner in ensuring the vitality of this global treasure\u2014Hip Hop.\nVision Statement  \nThe UHHM offers multi-generational audiences worldwide access to an immersive cultural art form, education, and entertainment experience not found anywhere online or offline. The UHHM provides a comprehensive study of the culture's past, present, and future via all mobile platforms. The museum's mobile framework and future brick and mortar facility will provide our patrons with a comprehensive analysis and study of Hip-Hop culture's evolution, with immersive stories about the people, places, and events that led to Hip-Hop's global popularity. The mobile platform designed by Carnevale Interactive allows the museum's patrons to take virtual tours of historic studios, clubs, neighborhoods, and landmarks while navigating seamlessly through 2D and 3D exhibitions, also allowing community participation via multiple social networking gateways. Full absorption by our patrons into the culture and its history with engaging interactive modules for the purpose of teaching, inspiring, and entertainment...edutainment fun for all.\nHelp Fund The Museum of The Future To Ensure Hip Hop's History Is Preserved\nThe virtual museum gives patrons access to the finest collection of artifacts, photography, artwork, research information, music and video content ever assembled. The UHHM in partnership with Framestore VR has already produced the world's first fully immersive VR concept for Hip-Hop culture. The recently launched The Kurtis Blow VR Experience designed for Google Cardboard  is available for Android users on the Google Play Store.  Field test marketing of the museum's first full immersive experience this past summer garnered rave reviews! As a result, the UHHM recognizes the widespread enthusiasm that the public will have for more immersive virtual reality exhibits. \nWith virtual and augmented reality technology set to change the way education is delivered to students, and how the general public is engaged, the virtual museum's use of VR and AR technology is positioned to lead the way forward with innovative cultural arts programming that will disrupt the current museum experience.  The virtual museum allows students to go on immersive tours of iconic places curated by Hip-Hop's biggest stars!  Future augmented reality exhibits produced for the virtual museum allows patrons to re-live Hip Hop history with multi-dimensional views that have never been possible before.\nThe virtual museum's mobile platform gives fans of Hip Hop rare access to the museum's archives, collections and galleries from anywhere in the world at any time of the day. \nStudents who browse the museum's digital timelines or immerse themselves in VR/AR exhibits will benefit from interactive educational programming that helps them fully absorb the History of Hip Hop Culture. The in-depth learning experience that students gain from the virtual museum immersive exhibits is sensational. The traditional \u201cVictorian\u201d museum model is a thing of the past. Patrons of the arts seek new immersive experiences with engaging content and the UHHM virtual museum delivers like none other. \nThe UHHM virtual museum platform is at the forefront of this technological advancement and will change the game of curating cultural arts exhibits.\nCombining Social Networking with Museum Curation\nThe design of the UHHM's virtual museum combines social media technology with mobile application exhibit design creating a unique interactive experience. The advanced community features enable patrons to share seminal moments in Hip-Hop history with their friends and other patrons of the museum, as they view the museum exhibits, galleries, and virtual tours or when they are watching video content or just enjoying soundtracks. As soon as patrons from around the world enter the virtual museum's exhibit halls, they can begin sharing their experience with other who are viewing the same presentation or immersed in other rooms or gallery spaces of the museum. The virtual museum is a global social network for fans that merges virtual reality experiences with the world's top social networking platforms . It's a new way to build community engagement within a museum experience!\n Check out the radio interview with our Chairman Rocky Bucano.

At the core of the harmful practice of racism and discrimination is a simple message: some people don\u2019t matter. If racism is a cancer, Hip Hop has proven to be a potent cure. Hip Hop was born as a response to the discrimination and poverty facing African-Americans in the late \u201970s.

Never lose your child-like curiosity. With the world\u2019s first Virtual Reality viewer in an iPhone case, you don\u2019t have to. Figment VR let you take your dreams and imagination with you.\nPLAY\n\nYou can explore amazing places, from Mt.Everest to the great barrier reefs - immerse in virtual reality. Here is a fun video showing how you can share amazing journeys with friends using Figment. \nPLAY\n\nWhat People are Saying\nAFFORDABLE VIRTUAL REALITY, ANYWHERE YOU ARE\nVirtual reality lets you fully immerse yourself in digital experiences that you could never get to on your own, like climbing to the top of Mt. Everest, rock-out on stage with Paul McCartney, or even shooting down globby aliens that swarm all around you. We think VR is super cool, but it\u2019s not as accessible as it could be.\nThe trouble is that VR viewers are a little bulky, so you don\u2019t get to have these experiences wherever you go. Just like the best camera is the one that\u2019s with you, the same thing goes for VR viewers.) Oculus has great quality, but keeps you tethered to your desk and is a bit pricey. Google Cardboard, the next step in viewer evolution, is affordable, but it is still bulky and you might not carry it around everywhere. So when you\u2019re reading the New York Times, in line at the coffee shop and happen to see a link to its new immersive storytelling app, you can\u2019t experience the stories until you get home. And by then your mind will be elsewhere.\nEnter Figment.\nUntethered and Immersive VR Entertainment\nShare epic adventures with your friends\nExplore & Learn with VR in your backyard\nVirtual Reality in your Pocket. \nThe Best VR Device is the One that's with You \nFigment uses your powerful iPhone to give amazing VR experiences. You can watch immersive VR movies & concerts, explore incredible travel destinations, and play games and more. \nIt just fits\nSecret VR pocket\nSlip in & out\nTake it with you anywhere, everywhere\nSnap on the case, enjoy VR anytime and everywhere.\nFigment cases are designed to protect your iPhone while maintaining its slim profile. All ports, cameras, and function buttons are open for quick and easy access.\nVR IN A PHONE CASE\nOf course, Figment needs to work as a phone case for you to want to carry it around in the first place.\nFigment is a VR viewer folded into a sleek iPhone case. It\u2019s pocket-sized, so you can bring it anywhere, and it\u2019s in a phone case, so you actually will bring it everywhere. Because it works with almost all VR apps, you can view or share an immersive VR experience anywhere you are.\nThe viewer folds in completely, making Figment as slim as the average phone case, and you can get to all of your buttons and ports with ease. \nSnap on the case, enjoy VR anytime and everywhere.\nA Perfect Fit for your Favorite iPhone\nWe\u2019ve designed Figment to work on iPhone 6, iPhone 6s, iPhone 6 Plus, and iPhone 6s Plus.\nIt will come in Dark and Light version \u2026 but keep an eye out for Champagne if we hit our stretch goals!\nPlus, as a bonus, the Figment also makes a nifty kickstand.\nWe\u2019ve designed the Figment to only cost $10 more than a plain old iPhone case, to make sure Virtual Reality stays as accessible as possible.\nDelightful Experience\nSpecifications\nThough it only weighs 2 oz, Figment is durable. It\u2019s made of polycarbonate plastic coated in silicone rubber for extra protection, the bridge is made of a high grade anodized aluminum, and the lenses are scratch resistant.\nThis means you can share that cool VR game with your clumsy friend, worry-free.\nOrigami VR Viewer\nThe viewer flips out to keep the screen the right distance from your eyes, then folds back in when not in use. The sleek design makes it easy to slide into your pocket with no more bulk than a regular phone case.\nTake Figment, Everywhere you Go\nFigment is pocket-sized so you can bring it anywhere, and because it\u2019s in a phone case, you will actually bring it everywhere. \nVR APPS FOR DAYS\nOur favorite thing about virtual reality is that you can experience just about anything: float in space, climb Mt. Everest, swim with sharks, explore ancient ruins, get a backstage pass, and even swish around a lightsaber. Because Figment uses your iPhone as the display, and because there\u2019s an ever-growing list of VR apps, you know you\u2019ll have plenty to explore.\nExplore 360 imagery of Mars taken by NASA/JPL\u2019s Spirit Rover and visit the Endeavor Space Shuttle with the official Google Cardboard app.\nExperience musical legend and visionary Sir Paul McCartney performing \"Live and Let Die\" in 360 degrees, with stereo 3D and immersive audio in Jaunt's first publicly released cinematic VR experience.\nVrse has created some of the best cinematic virtual reality experiences. Fully immerse yourself in 3D and full screen 360 degree curated video content, with dynamically changing directional binaural sound.\nExplore world landmarks like the Eiffel Tower, discover natural wonders, and step inside locations such as the Great Barrier Reef in Australia, with immersive 360-degree images on Google Street View.\nThe Porsche VR experience lets you go for a test drive at the world famous Porsche Experience Center in Atlanta, GA in full 360\u00ba.\nTry the following apps to start:\nGoogle Cardboard App (we recommend exploring virtual reality StreetView) \nJaunt VR (we recommend getting backstage while Paul McCartney plays \u201cLive and Let Die\u201d)\nVrse (we recommend sitting amongst U2 while they play) \nNew York Times (we recommend immersing yourself in the life of a Syrian refugee) \nPorsche VR (we recommend test-driving the 911 Targa) \nDiscovery Channel (we recommend diving with sharks around a shipwreck) \nLegendary (we recommend piloting a Jaeger battlemech against a Kaiju monster) \nRoller Coaster VR (we recommend this for kids too short to ride the real thing)\nVirtual reality is pretty amazing. We think that coming soon, augmented reality (virtual things integrated into your real surroundings) will be even cooler. Imagine looking around through your viewer, spotting your vintage record of Paul McCartney\u2019s \u201cLive and Let Die\u201d on your desk, and having your phone immerse you in the concert experience. Or looking at your Starbucks Pumpkin Spice Latte and being transported to a tropical coffee plantation or a rustic pumpkin farm. The future\u2019s looking pretty bright, and Figment is ready for it!\nRewards\nWe\u2019re starting our journey with Kickstarter because we believe the backer community will play an integral role in the development of Figment. The future retail price for Figment VR case will be $79. Supporting us on Kickstarter means that not only will you be getting a great deal, you\u2019ll also be among the first to experience Figment first hand. Most importantly, you will be helping usher in a new era of accessible mobile VR that is available any time, any place. Thank you!\nInternational Backers\nWe will ship Figment worldwide, with the exception of Argentina, Belarus, Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Lebanon, Libya, Myanmar/Burma, North Korea, Russia, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Ukraine and Yemen. Please note that you may be responsible for duties, fees and taxes applicable to your region.\nDesign & Manufacturing\nWe designed a delightful lens deployment system, so you can quickly and easily transform the Figment case into a VR device. Simply slide the triggers on the back of the device to unfold the VR lens.\nPrototypes & Designs along the way\nDesigned down to the smallest detail, every aspect of Figment has gone through many iterations in order to arrive at the current design. We\u2019ve invested time and resource to design and iterate through various industrial design concepts through partnership with FATHOM in Oakland, CA. Further, PCH Lime Lab is our product design engineering partner and now we have a working prototype that\u2019s made with the manufacturing and assembly process in mind so we are confident we can turn Figment into an amazing, final product. \nColor, Material, and Finishing all work together to perfectly complement your iPhone.\nPLAY\n\nTimeline\nWe've reduced our production and fulfillment risks by partnering with PCH (pchintl.com) to help manage our supply chain and manufacturing process, and deliver Figment to your door. Here is our detailed manufacturing schedule:\nOur Team\nWe\u2019re a group of techies passionate about making products that are easy and intuitive enough for anyone to use.

The team we assembled has many combined years of experience designing, prototyping, producing, and delivering hardware and software to happy end consumers. The best news is that Figment is nearly complete. However, to sufficiently mitigate any residual risks and road bumps along the way that can cause delays in getting the final product into your hands, we have already done a great deal of work before launching on Kickstarter. The first thing we\u2019ve done to minimize risks is to set a realistic funding goal we need to hit, not just one that\u2019s easy to hit, to kick start the manufacturing process. We\u2019ve further reduced our production and fulfillment risks by partnering with PCH (pchintl.com) to help manage our supply chain and manufacturing process and deliver Figment to your door. \n\nWe\u2019ve also already tackled the engineering around the folding and unfolding mechanism, and we\u2019re now working with PCH and our contract manufacturer on reliability, standard operating procedure (SOP), and process verification to identify opportunities to reduce cost and improve manufacturability and to prepare the assembly factory for production set-up & mass production ramp up. \n\nIn short we are doing everything in our power to bring you Figment as quickly as possible. However, there always remain risks that may be out of our control:\n\nUnforeseen Delays:\nOrders are being placed for longer lead parts, but unexpected delays and shortages of components can occur. If this happens, we\u2019ll be sure to keep you informed and work with our supply chain to quickly solve the problem.\n\nProduct Adjustments:\nAs Figment gets geared up for mass production, there will likely be some minor adjustments to improve the final product. Pre-production prototypes are made to test and refine the product and allow us to incorporate our adjustments and those suggested by our experienced manufacturing partners. These will always be for the benefit of you, the consumer, and if we do make any changes, we will clearly explain exactly how these changes are being made, why they are being made, and their potential impact on schedule. \n\nAny pledge amount brings us one step closer to our goal.

Here's one we built earlier.\nHEAT-1X - 9.3 meters tall, 1.6 tons - designed and built by this team\nKickstarter backers will get exclusive access to a real-life space mission, joining in making key decisions as we design, build and finally launch the Moonspike rocket. You can ask us questions, and give us suggestions that could alter the course of our mission. \nAs a team member you'll have access to some superb rewards, like membership of the Moonspike Academy, access to Mooncamp, a seat at mission control, your own data in the space payload, actual parts from the rocket and numerous limited edition goodies like mission patches, posters, challenge coins and pins. And of course you can follow our progress through video diaries and video chats.\nThe Moon Rocket\nWe looked at literally hundreds of design options and settled on a design using proven space technology with a few modern twists. Our intention is to build a two-stage, liquid-fuelled vehicle that is capable of lifting a small spacecraft into Low Earth Orbit (LEO). We will then send that spacecraft to the Moon carrying our payload.\nThe Spacecraft\nThe spacecraft is the third stage of the vehicle, and has a mass of 147kgs when fuelled. This little vehicle will make the transit from Earth to Moon and end it's life impacting the Moon at around 2,000m/s.\n\nThe spacecraft is largely a container for the volumes of liquids and gases used to push it towards the moon, with communications and guidance electronics, and the tiny, symbolic 1 gram payload attached. When it arrives at the Moon there will be just 35kg of empty spacecraft left.\n\n\nThe Payload\nWe named this mission after this tiny symbolic payload - the Moonspike. We chose a very tiny 1 gram payload as a demonstration, in order to make the problem of building a moon rocket as simple as possible.\n\nThe Moonspike is a tiny spike of titanium that is designed to survive a hard landing with the moon.\n\nIt's important to note that the payload is just a demonstration - the main challenge of this adventure is building and launching the rocket, and sending that tiny spacecraft 400,000km through space to the Moon.\n\n\nThe Journey\nRewards\nShipping for Christmas 2015!\nWe have had several questions about shipping in time for the Holiday season.\nThe images of the mission patch, lapel button and challenge coin are of the actual sample items, not Photoshop - we have already made the tooling, and you are looking at the real thing. This means that if we get funded by November 1, we would order those right way and should be able to ship in time for December 2015 holidays. This also applies the A2 concept art posters.\nSo if you are looking for a great Christmas gift for for your children, nieces, nephews, grandchildren or other space enthusiasts for the holidays, you know which rewards will be available.\nYour memories transported to the Moon\nThanks to the wonders of digital data, even a symbolic 1 gram allows us to carry the hopes and dreams of millions of people. And that\u2019s a core part of what you get from joining this project - you can send (almost) any digital content you want to the Moon.\n\nWhat can you send? A cherished love letter. A beautiful video of your children. A song that reminds you of your wedding day. The novel you once wrote but never published. The movies from your honeymoon. The photo of your mother and father. The home movie of the winning goal. A blessing on your family from the heavens. That software you\u2019ve been working on. Artworks you created in college.\n\nWe can transport your memories, thoughts and dreams to another world, locking it in the Moon for eternity. And in generations to come, your children and grandchildren will be able to look up at the sky and point to that monument.\n\nPhotos of the Earth and the Moon from the Spacecraft\n\nYou are sending an actual spacecraft to the Moon, and because of the novel navigation system, we\u2019re going to be able to send back photos \u2013 not photos shot by someone else, but photos your own spacecraft took during its voyage.\n\nTo commemorate that achievement, the spacecraft will take higher resolution photographs of both the Earth, looking back as we head away, and the Moon as we arrive. And you will get a high quality physical photographic print of each, signed by the team. Each photo will be 5\u201dx7\u201d, suitable for framing, on high quality photographic stock.\nMoonspike Academy\nJoin the team as a Moonspike Academy Member and get a full vote on key issues as we progress, as well as a dedicated smartphone app.\nThe exclusive members-only app will allow you to access team updates one full day before the general public, simulate the mission with a range of engine and payload variables \u2013 allowing you to show your friends what you are supporting - and most importantly vote on choices the team faces at various key stages of the project.\nYou will also be invited to join the annual Academy general meeting in person, and get a personal briefing on project progress.\nAcademy membership comes complete with an Academy membership card and lanyard. Travel not included. \nMooncamp\nJoin the team for a full week on-site at the factory. You will learn about how we design and build rockets, and get hands-on experience in the factory actually building the Moonspike rocket and spacecraft that will travel to the Moon.\nMooncamp will feature interactive sessions from all the key team members, with full details on the challenges of designing spacecraft, how we design and build engines, pump systems, navigations systems, guidance and control mechanisms.\nYou\u2019ll get to design your own moon rocket, with guidance from the team; listen in on team design meetings; and even fabricate actual rocket components that will be used on the rocket and spacecraft.\nIncludes participant t-shirt and Moonspike Academy membership, and runs in the two weeks either side of the annual Academy meeting. A perfect gift for young people who are interested in knowing more about hands on rocket design and fabrication, and an opportunity to build direct experience that might be useful on your resume.\nTravel / accomodation not included. Must be 18 years of age or older.\nMission Patch\nIt\u2019s a simple patch, but comes from a long heritage. Almost every mission into space has its own unique mission patch.\nThe Moonspike patch tell the story of the journey we are planning from Earth to Moon, and also signals to the world that you\u2019re a supporter of open access to space.\nThe custom-made 4\" Moonspike patch is 100% embroidered with an iron-on backing, perfect for overalls, jackets or backpacks.\nLapel button\nFull of vibrant detail, the 1.25\u201d gold-plated lapel button is a specially minted cloisonn\u00e9 pin that shows the Moonspike mission in full color, and discreetly tells the world you are a supporter of open access to space and the Moonspike project.\nEach button is made from a custom casting that is 1.2mm thick, and then plated with 10K gold. Each pin has an 8mm post and a butterfly clutch attachment, to ensure it stays securely on your jacket.\n\nChallenge Coin\nThis specially minted 2\u201d Moonspike challenge coin is a unique memorial of the founding of the Moonspike project.\nChallenge coins are a very old military and aeronautical tradition, with astronauts using mission coins to win bets - challenges - or make small crewing decisions. Even the President of the United States has his own challenge coins, in case of a \u201cchallenge\u201d when on a military base.\nWe\u2019ve recreated that history in the Moonspike challenge coin. It features two unique high gloss faces showing both the Moonspike mission and lunar spacecraft. The coin is finished to a very high standard, with bezel cut edges and nickel plating for robustness.\nPosters  \nCarsten Brandt has created some amazing and gorgeous concept art to illustrate the Moonspike mission, and we are offering superb A2 posters of five of his beautiful creations.\nCarsten works as an art director in the video game industry, and his credits include the Watchmen series. He also teaches video game design at the Danish Royal Academy of Fine Arts.\nThe Moonspike posters will be delivered rolled, rather than folded, to avoid any creasing, and will be printed on high quality stock to ensure they stand the test of time.\nLogo on the Rocket\nIt\u2019s the ultimate. Nothing could be more exclusive than your name on the side of a Moon rocket.\nAnd we have limited spaces, to ensure that backers that choose this reward are highly visible. Logo placement can be selected on the two stages, in two different formats. \nIt\u2019s expensive, but if you want to get your brand in a premium position on a Moonshot, this is what you are looking for.\nA Thruster in Your Name\nThe Moonspike spacecraft features 8 thrusters, and we want to give them some personality. So we\u2019re letting you choose what to call them.\nName it after your loved ones, your pet, your favorite place, your company \u2013 you choose. And from then on, we will refer to that thruster with that name in all designs, publications and documents.\nThere are some restrictions, but if it\u2019s acceptable it will fly.\nWhy back us?\nExperience\nWhile there are probably thousands of people on the planet who have theoretical knowledge of what it takes to build rockets, very few have hands-on experience of building and launching large-scale rocket vehicles.\nBut the team we have gathered have both professional training with organizations like NASA and hands-on experience building rockets at Copenhagen Suborbitals, a private team of amateur rocket builders who designed and built several very successful rockets on a shoestring budget during the past 7 years.\nThe vehicles this team have designed and launched include the 9.3m tall, liquid-fueled HEAT-1X, and the actively guided 5.3m Sapphire rocket. \nTransparency\nA typical space project will be quite secretive. We\u2019re going to be almost the exact opposite.\nWhatever happens, good or bad, we\u2019re going to be open about it, through blogs, videos, and interviews. \nInstead of hiding behind a wall, we'll let you see exactly where your support is going on a very regular basis.\nAdventure\n50 years ago sending rockets to the Moon was a genuinely amazing thing. The glory and power of the incredible Saturn V rocket ascending from the launch pad with 3 tiny, courageous human astronauts on board inspired and awed a generation of kids.\nWhen we were kids, there was a wondrous awe about space voyages, something that has been missing from the modern era. We want to get back to that feeling, of just doing this thing for the sheer joy of watching it climb into the sky and hopefully, eventually, land on the Moon.\nWhether we succeed or fail, this project is intended to be a fascinating, awe-inspiring adventure for all participants, and that includes our supporters.\nFocus\nMany space projects are very ambitious, with vast budget requirements. This is typically driven by trying to launch people or enormous spacecraft with extraordinary goals, and need billions of dollars.\nWe\u2019ve figured out a way to make a real space mission possible on a reasonable budget by focusing on a relatively simple and highly focused goal \u2013 just get something small to the Moon.\nWe think this will allow us to achieve real results. We know that we will need to raise more money the course of the project, and this Kickstarter helps us get started.\nEngineering\nWhen we thought about what it is we are trying to do, we figure it is more of an engineering task than anything else.\nMost of the technology is well documented and understood today; our challenge is making that work with a small team and a micro budget instead of NASA's billions.\nMostly it's about finding smart solutions to classic engineering issues, and that's why the pragmatic, hands-on experience of the team is crucial. \nCredentials\nOne key aspect that makes Moonspike truly unique and unusual is the track record of the engineering team in designing and building space rockets.\nAlmost all of our team come from key roles within the Copenhagen Suborbitals project, which has been one of the most successful and widely regarded amateur space projects ever \u2013 in fact collectively the Copenhagen Suborbitals team won a prestigious Breitling FAI medal for their extraordinary work on a miniscule budget. Those guys are awesome.\nMoonspike is going to continue that heritage, with a budget that gives the team an opportunity to build equally innovative and adventurous space hardware to professional standards.\nFeasibility study\nAs we said above in the transparency section, we want to be very open about what we are doing on this project, and this starts today. \nWe\u2019ve been working hard to develop our rocket and space-craft designs over the past few months and today we are opening up our feasibility study document to the public for you to review the design and understand the considerations we have worked though in the past months. \nYou can download the complete feasibility study document to review the mission, technology and design here. \nWe invite you to download these technical specifications today and check our calculations. \nWe hope you understand that we have made many design decisions and trade-offs to get to this initial design, which has a very specific purpose, so it\u2019s unlikely we will change the design significantly unless we have made some fundamentally erroneous calculations. \nNaturally if you spot any mistakes or issues we would be happy to hear from you.\nWhere will the money go?\nBasically we will use your support to get this thing off the ground, literally.\nUntil now we have spent about 9 months preparing. We raised some seed money to get this far, and now we need the Kickstarter community backing to get us up and running, to the point that we can test some of the most critical sub-systems like turbo pumps and navigation systems, and fire our first engines. \nThe main goal of this funding will be to get our factory set up, install the core members of staff, and start designing, developing, building and buying components to start actually making the rocketship.\nRent a rocket factory \nWe have already scoped out a candidate for our premises, and we will sign up for a 1-2 year lease with the one that seems to be the best fit it funded. \nEquip the workshops\nOnce the factory is available we will equip it with all the basic machines we need to start producing rockets and spacecraft - lathes, CNC machines, drills, welding tools etc.\nBuy materials and components\nA large percentage of the money we raise through Kickstarter will go directly into buying materials and components needed to design, develop and actually build the rocket.\nPay staff\nWe need a focused, dedicated team working on this project. So we want you to know transparently that some of the money will go towards paying staff (and income taxes).\nStart building\nOnce we have made initial purchases of equipment and materials, most cost are the basic running costs of a small rocket factory \u2013 electricity, internet, rocket fuel, liquid oxygen etc. With the money you generously provide we expect to be able to start taking this project 100% seriously and build some amazing machines. In parallel your support gives us a cash runway to generate the next round of funding from other sources. \nKickstarter is a going to get us off to a great start, and we\u2019re also working on many other avenues of funding to ensure we can fulfil our promises to you and get your data, pictures, movies, stories onto the Moon. \nTimeline\nWe\u2019re ready to get going \u2013 in fact some of our team members have already started work, in the expectation that Kickstarter supporters will be right behind us.\nWe have spent the past 9 months figuring out if this was actually possible and the numbers all check out.\nThe only component we are missing is your participation and help. By the end of 2015 we hope to have the rocket factory up and running, and by late next year we want to be able to start firing test engines. \nWe\u2019d love to have you all along for the ride, and ultimately transport your data to the Moon.\nWe\u2019re going back to the Moon. Why not join the team today?\nPhoto credits: NASA, Copenhagen Suborbitals", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nMoonspike is an exciting and ambitious project. Owing to the nature of its size, scale and complexity (not to mention all of the unknowns of space and lunar exploration which we hope to learn about on the way) Moonspike is bigger and more complicated than the average Kickstarter project and so there are more risks and challenges involved and a few extra considerations in addition to those provided on Kickstarter\u2019s website. By making a pledge to Moonspike\u2019s Kickstarter project, you agree to accept the risks as we\u2019ve defined them below, and any other risks known or unknown, even if they are not explicitly stated herein. \n\nWe may have to request further information from Backers to enable delivery of the rewards; change the dates on which we estimate that the project will be finished or we will be able to deliver rewards; or make other changes. Moonspike Limited will do its best to notify you of any such changes via Kickstarter.com, its website, and/or any an email address that you provide. All questions or disputes regarding eligibility for and delivery of pledge rewards will be resolved solely by Moonspike Limited and within the legal jurisdiction of the UK.\n\nMoonspike is a unique project with many contingent parts including design, engineering, mission control, regulation, legal and financing. This Kickstarter project is to raise the funds to set up the basic infrastructure to begin developing and testing prototype parts and systems. To be clear, this Kickstarter campaign is not intended to fund the entire development process or mission. You are funding a design and development process, the initial goal of which is to begin real work on hardware and software. The final rocket launcher and spacecraft may differ from current designs and imagery. Our project may also be influenced by the Kickstarter process, and may change following the campaign based on input from technical review, regulatory oversight or commercial commitments.\n\nThe launch and operation of a new, experimental space launch vehicle and spacecraft is technically complex and involves many risks beyond Moonspike Limited\u2019s control. Moonspike Limited is not responsible for any failure to perform all or part of the Kickstarter project if such failure is caused by third parties and events or conditions beyond Moonspike Limited\u2019s reasonable control. This includes but is not limited to explosions, spillages, accidents, acts of nature, war, civil disturbances, acts of civil or military authorities, legal or regulatory changes, asteroid impacts, alien interference, loss of radio or other communications signals, or other causes beyond Moonspike Limited\u2019s control. \n\nAdditionally, and due to the extremely experimental nature of the project, Moonspike Limited cannot be held liable for failure to perform all or part of the Kickstarter project due to errors or omissions in the design and manufacture of the launch vehicle or spacecraft.\n\nManaging the processing of many thousands of photos, videos, and data files will require automation, and we will be building a platform help simplify and streamline content uploading. No submission will be accepted outside this automated process. All Backers whose pledge contains data transport rewards will be responsible for the integrity of their own content prior to uploading. Any content supplied may be scanned for viruses or other harmful or malicious attributes. All data or images may be visually inspected for explicit, offensive, illegal or copyright infringing content.\n\nTo obtain a reward a Backer must be verified following the completion of a successful Kickstarter campaign and the full pledge payment received. It will also be the Backer\u2019s responsibility to keep Moonspike Limited up-to-date with contact details and whereabouts. All rewards are subject to availability and restrictions may apply as to when or where rewards can be provided. In the event Moonspike Limited is unable to fulfill any reward for any reason, Moonspike Limited will not be liable to offer any substitute or alternative reward. We estimate that in some situations it may take several years to fulfil all pledge rewards to Backers of the Kickstarter campaign.

Choose one of the PS4 reward tiers to reserve your copy!\n***\nFULLY FUNDED IN 5 DAYS! THANK YOU, BACKERS!\nWe still have plenty of fun stretch goals to reach. Please keep spreading the word!\nYou are a dog, lost in a sprawling and unfamiliar city. You wander the streets, searching for scraps, for shelter, for a friendly face. Slowly, you overcome some of your fears. You learn where you can snag a meaty bone, where you can sleep warm and safe at night. Strange streets become familiar territory. One by one, the streets become yours. You find friends. Eventually, maybe, home.\nProjected Release: Fall 2016 on Mac, Windows and PS4\nHome Free is an open-world action-RPG starring a dog lost in a sprawling, randomly generated city. Use your canine abilities to explore this strange, sometimes hostile environment and find your place in the world.\nI've been working on Home Free for about two years now, and I'm very excited to show you where I've taken it so far. This project is the culmination of a lot of work and a bunch of crazy interests: procedural content, urbanism, quadrupedal locomotion, and dogs -- how they play, the stories we tell about them, and what makes them tick.\nFeatures\nBe a dog in an unexplored city!\nPlay as any of over a dozen breeds (plus many more color and marking variations). Maybe even more, depending on stretch goals and rewards!\nExplore a dense, procedurally-generated city unique to your game. Every street, alleyway, building, nook and cranny was generated just for your game. No one has been here before, so you better start marking your territory.\nPlayer-driven narrative. Shape the story of one dog's survival through your choices and actions. Experience the the world from the perspective a creature who will never quite understand why that world acts the way it does.\nWrestle, wriggle, and pounce. Home Free features a full range of canine moves to master, whether you're playing with friendly dogs in a local park or escaping the aggressions of territorial dogs in a dark alley.\nLearn the unique rhythms of your city. Which neighborhood has the tastiest garbage just after sunset? What park empties at mid-day so you and your dog friends can have a fun romp when no one's around?\nDecide how to survive. Will you be a bandit, stealing food from unsuspecting humans when you can? A performer, trying to earn treats and sympathy from dog-friendly citizens? Or a scavenger, sticking to the margins and following your nose?\nDog it up with your friends in real life! Home Free comes bundled with my local multiplayer dog wrasslin' game, Dog Park, included at all backer levels!\nA dog is always hungry. To survive in the big city, you'll need to decide how best to satisfy your doggy hunger.\nA World Made For Humans...\nThe city is noisy, crowded and surprising, built for two-legged creatures whose ways are hard to understand. Some seem friendly. Can you get them to share their food? Others run screaming when they see you. Maybe they want you to chase them? Some attack on sight, with hands and sticks and boots. What\u2019s your best escape route? Noisy metal boxes fly by in unpredictable patterns. Are you fast enough to dodge them? It\u2019s their city, but you can still master its streets.\nA time lapse of the city generator at work. Every game gets its own unique city. No strategy guides or FAQs will help you here. You are truly lost.\n...A World Full of Dogs\nYou're far from the only one of your kind in this place. Other dogs prowl the streets. Some protect their territory and won't let you pass without a fight. Some are wary and keep their distance. Some could be friends. A sniff, a chase, and a romp through a park is all it takes to seal a friendship. And who knows, maybe one friendship can lead to another\u2026\nAll trailer footage was captured in-game from a pre-alpha build of Home Free.\nHome Free is a beautiful, heartbreaking single player experience, but it also comes bundled with a raucous multiplayer mode: DOG PARK!\nDog Park is a 4-player, local multiplayer dog wrasslin' game, and it comes with Home Free! Become a dog as you chase, wrestle, cavort and gambol with other players in a chaotic struggle to have as much fun as you can.  \nThe new, improved version of Dog Park included with Home Free will feature a bunch of new game modes, improved controls and physics, as well as all the new dog breeds added to Home Free.\nDog Park installed at No Quarter 2014 in New York.\nI created Dog Park for the NYU Game Center's yearly No Quarter show, and debuted it there in September 2014. Dog Park is a game about my fascination with the dynamics of dog play.\nDogs are possibly the world's best game players: they have a huge appetite for play, they manage to negotiate new games with each other without using language, and they seem to play games for the sheer joy of it, not really caring who wins or who loses. Dog Park is my attempt to recreate some of that experience for four humans at a time, in videogame form.\nThe version of Dog Park shown at No Quarter (and at the IndieCade 2014 E-Sports Showcase) was an experimental game about canine play. The \"winner\" of the game is the dog who had the most fun, and fun comes in many forms: chasing and being chased, wrestling with other dogs, playing king of the hill on a picnic table.\nThe final version of Dog Park, included as part of Home Free, will feature several new game modes that offer new goals and new reasons to unleash your furry fury with three other friends.\nHome Free features a brand new, original soundtrack composed by Mark Robinson!\nMark founded the Teen-Beat record label and has been a member of the bands Unrest, Air Miami, Flin Flon, Cotton Candy, and Fang Wizard. \nMark's music is what this game has sounded like in my head since I first started prototyping it over two years ago. If it ever turned into a real game, I knew I'd have to ask him to work on the soundtrack. I had no plan B. It's an amazing feeling to have one of my favorite artists making music for my game, and I'm very, very excited about it.\nThe music in the trailer is a track Mark made just for this Kickstarter campaign. He's already shared some early sketches for songs that will become part of the final soundtrack, and there's so much good stuff in there.\nDo dogs even like music? I don't know. But I know I already can't imagine Home Free without it.\nThe Game\nA DRM-Free digital copy of Home Free (including Dog Park), on Mac or PC.\nDigital Wallpapers\nA collection of high-res wallpapers featuring cute digital dogs for your computer or phone. (Image for illustration purposes only -- there will be more, and different!)\nStickers\nA set of 5 full-color, die-cut vinyl stickers of sweet low-poly dogs. Stick 'em on your laptop or wherever else people stick sticky things.(Image for illustration purposes only)\nT-Shirt\nChoose one of two designs (or pick the $95 tier for both) of cool polygonal dogs doing cool polygonal dog things!\nBe In the Game\nSend me a photo and I'll use magic to digitize you into an abstract, low-poly human NPC who will play an important role in the city. Includes a few high res screenshots of your digital doppelganger in various poses so you can show off to your friends.\nYour Dog In The Game\nI create a fully customized, stylized low-poly playable version of your dog in the game! Just send me some photos, a couple measurements, and a quick description, and I'll interpret your dog as a cartoony, low-poly playable character. Comes with a collection of high res images of your dog in action and in funny poses.\nPlease note the some dogs are more compatible with Home Free's art style than others. If you're wondering whether your dog would be a good choice, message me!\nThe Full Digital Best Friend Experience\nI create a custom, playable version of your dog and a custom, NPC version of you. I also create an ultra-exclusive, fully customized ambient minigame experience featuring digital you and your digital companion spending some quality time relaxing alone in the park together.\nI've been working on this project for approximately two years. Dog Park debuted in September, 2014 at No Quarter in New York City, and was shown again at IndieCade 2014 in the E-Sports Showcase.\nAbout a year before work began on Dog Park, I started experimenting with building a procedural city engine. Walking around in this dense, twisty, mysterious place felt great almost immediately, and I kept experimenting even though I didn't really know what I was going to do with it.\nHome Free is the combination of these two projects: Dog Park provides the dogs, and the city project provides the world you'll explore.\nAt this point, all of that is working well; the trailer was made entirely from in-game footage captured from a pre-alpha build. I've spent my time so far building out the skeleton for Home Free -- an engine that creates vibrant procedurally-generated open world city environments and a system for dog movement, interaction, and control.\nThe fundamentals are now in place, and with your help, I'll spend the next year building out more content, deepening single player gameplay, and tuning controls.\nWhat's Next?\nGameplay programming. Flesh out and add content to the game's core systems of exploration, hunger management, and character development.\nScenario design. Create semi-scripted situations for the player character to encounter in the world: patrolling aggressive dogs, friendly humans with specific requirements, unfriendly humans, NPC-to-NPC interactions that create opportunities for food and advancement.\nCity content and generator refinement. Create a bunch more city assets to avoid randomly-generated \"sameness\" problem. Define larger number of \"neighborhood\" types (currently there are only two) to create more variation and local flavor (similar to \"biomes\" in Minecraft).\nDog modeling and animation. Create at least 5 additional dog body types (maybe more depending on stretch goals and rewards!). Continue building out library of dog behaviors, interactions, and movements.\nI've brought this project pretty far over the past couple years. I've laid the groundwork for a game I'm excited to play, a world I want to spend time in, and a chance to see that world from my favorite animal's perspective. \nWhat I need now is the ability to focus entirely on this crazy idea to see it through to conclusion. So far, all the code, art, animation, and game design has been done by me, on my own. The funds from Kickstarter will allow me to get help on the things I'm not so good at, like music and sound, will enable me to invest in the tools and software I need to make this thing shine, and give me the opportunity to work full-time on Home Free until it's done.\nKevin Cancienne @potatojin\nGame Design, Art, Animation & Programming\nKevin is an independent game developer based in New York.

Home Free is no different.\n\nThe biggest risk to Home Free, as described here, is to its schedule. Software projects sometimes take longer than anticipated, and I want to be honest about that possibility here. I'm helped by the fact that I'm not starting from scratch -- there's over two years' worth of groundwork already laid here. I estimate honestly that another year of steady work fleshing out gameplay, adding content, testing and prepping for release will get me to the finish line. But things go wrong, and I'm only human, so it might all take longer than I want.\n\nAnother \"risk\" that's inherent to all game projects is the risk that elements of the design will change and evolve over the course of the project. Game design is an iterative process, and the process of building, testing, playing, re-building, and re-playing has a way of overturning your early assumptions. This is the beauty of game design, but I also want to be clear with you, my backers, that Home Free is a work in progress, and as it gets better and more complete, it will also evolve. I hope you'll want to join me on that journey.\n\nI've been making games for more than 15 years. In that time, I've shipped nearly 30 of them. I've applied that experience to the planning that's gone into this project, and I'm going to continue to apply it overcome any of the obstacles I'm sure to face in bringing this project to life.

Instead, the Digital Signal Processor (DSP) inside Here acts as a studio in your ears by providing you with a volume knob, equalizer and effects to transform real world audio. Use this \u201cremote control for your ears\u201d to have an optimal listening experience every time.\nHERE PROVIDES AUDIO CURATION TOOLS FOR EVERY LIVE ENVIRONMENT\nHere has been engineered to give you control of any and all live listening experiences: Suppress the jet engine on an airplane. Reduce a baby crying. Boost the bass at a club. Live mix a concert by adding reverb. Enhance your senses and personalize every listening experience.\n  THE TECH\nThe technology used in Here is fundamentally different from any audio technology that has come before it. Here uses a variety of signal processing algorithms that target specific frequency ranges to modify sound as it enters your ears. Each Here bud captures incoming sound waves, processes the audio, and then plays back the desired result with no perceivable latency (i.e. in under 30 microseconds). \nHERE LISTENING (SIMULATED)\nAlthough nothing compares to actually experiencing the live curation provided by the Here system, we\u2019ve put together a clip (an original track by our very own graphic designer, Geoff Lynn of the Newcomers Club) that simulates some of its functions.\nThe track below illustrates how a few features that will be available in the Here app\u2014Bass Boost, Treble Boost, Reverb, and Flange\u2014are intended to sound when you use the Here Active Listening System:\nTHE FIRST TRUE HEARABLE\nHere is not meant to replace your headphones, headsets, or earbuds. The Here Active Listening System is designed for live listening environments, and is optimized for targeted, episodic use in live scenarios (e.g. concerts, stadiums, flights) where you can control and curate what\u2019s happening in real time. Put simply, earbuds are for listening to recorded audio. Here buds are for engaging with real world sound.\nCURATE LIVE MUSIC AND CREATE YOUR OWN SONIC WORLD\nThe Here system has been optimized for live music, so we invited two of the world's top violinists to our NY office to put it to the test. Watch Charles Yang and Tessa Lark demo an early Here prototype and experiment with live EQ:\nHANS AND HERE\nHans Zimmer, legendary film composer and music producer, has been an invaluable partner in helping us ensure that Here\u2019s functionality is optimized for live music listening. Watch below as he explores an early Here prototype and talks about the future of sound, music listening, technology, and the vast potential of what Here could mean for the future of how we hear the world:\nDESIGN\nGiven that it's the first product of its kind, Here presented a unique challenge for our design team. We wanted to create a wearable that you would be proud to wear - something that was both functional and elegant. To achieve this, we developed a product architecture that optimizes battery power and efficiency, while being discreet enough to allow you to bae yourself in social settings.\nThe simple shape of the Here buds masks the complexity of its many components. It took us months to figure out how to fit so much tech into a small form factor that sits comfortably and securely within the ear. The inner shape of the Here buds is the result of countless iterations and prototypes, tested and evaluated hundreds of times. To further optimize comfort and performance, Here has three interchangeable sizes of custom designed silicone tips.\nENGINEERING PROCESS\nHere is redefining the limits of low-power signal processing and in-ear audio computing. We\u2019ve chosen a comprehensive combination of hardware components and features for optimal live audio processing (and listening): a low power ARM processor for effects and EQ calculations, an ultra low latency audio input/output system, and a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) radio for control via smart phone. Our premium low-noise MEMS microphones handle massive SPL, while the powerful driver can add or subtract wide-band audio so that you can tailor your sound experience in even the loudest of acoustic environments. \nOn the mechanical side, we carefully selected materials and engineered complex internal air spaces to allow for maximum sound reduction, targeted signal processing and deep bass. We ran tests in simulation on our boards and on our early \u201cFranken-Here\u201d models (see below) to ensure the highest quality performance. \nTESTING\nAfter countless months of testing the Here system in our lab, Jacob (our Director of Design) and Andrew (Senior Product Engineer) went undercover with an early working prototype to try out the Here buds during our partnership activation at Coachella 2015. It was important for us to make sure that Here worked in a loud, real world music setting, and we couldn't think of a better environment than Coachella. Check it out!\nTHE DOPPLER LABS VISION: IMMERSIVE WEARABLE TECHNOLOGY\nAt Doppler Labs, we believe in a post-mobile future where tech gets out of the way of the human experience. We believe wearable technology should integrate seamlessly into our lives and enable us to curate our environment to our liking. In service of that vision, we build products that give you the tools to engage with the world around you without removing you from the moment or experience.\nThe Here Active Listening System is the first step in pursuing that vision. We wanted to provide the best sound quality at shows, remove unwanted noise, and fix sleepless overnight flights, so we created an elegant solution to give you control of your audio environment.\nAs our technology becomes more powerful with each iteration (and each additional user), we open up doors for future innovation. The possibilities of what we can do with a speaker, microphone, and computer in your ear are limitless, from using voice as an input modality and speech as an output modality to transforming the fundamentals of human communication.\nWHERE WE'VE BEEN: DUBS ACOUSTIC FILTERS\nWe launched DUBS Acoustic Filters in September 2014 and since then have sold hundreds of thousands of DUBS, won several design awards, and most importantly have gained the praise of audiophiles around the world, with some even claiming that the DUBS Acoustic Filters were \"the best thing I bought this year\".\nBy creating the DUBS, we were able to gain valuable experience. We assembled a team with proven expertise in launching new products, forged partnerships across the music space (e.g. Coachella, Tao Group, SoulCycle, Bonnaroo/Outside Lands, AM Only, Tiesto, Hans Zimmer, Quincy Jones), learned valuable information about our ears (their shape and how they perceive sound), and worked out the kinks of manufacturing products in China.\nThis experience has proven invaluable to the development of our team as we begin to ramp up for production of the Here Active Listening System. Given our track record, we are highly confident in our ability to deliver a great product and deliver it in the projected timeframe.\nMEET THE HERE TEAM\nOur confidence in our vision is founded in the expertise of our highly experienced team of designers, engineers, technologists and business leaders.\nDoppler Labs is dedicated to our vision of enhancing all aspects of the listening experience by building immersive wearable technology. Each team member plays a critical role in helping us achieve our vision, drawing on their own personal experience building and shipping products for major tech companies like Apple, Amazon, Google and Microsoft, and disruptive start-ups like ClassPass, Dropbox, Palantir, Sonos, and Tesla (via Interlink Electronics).\nWe are launching the Here Active Listening System on Kickstarter because we believe in cultivating a community who can contribute to the development of Here. Through Kickstarter we are able to reach the most forward-thinking, passionate people who can provide us with valuable feedback that will help make our product great. Launching a new technology is hard. And we can use all the help we can get.\nSo if you are interested in music, sound, wearables, the future of hearing, bionics or computing, join us in the movement to optimize the way we experience real world audio, and help us change the way we all hear the world. \nAre you a software developer?\nJoin us in making Here more than just a product. If you are a developer, we would love your help in growing the Here system into a platform for your ears.  \nFor priority access to our forthcoming developer platform and first tier support from the Doppler Labs team, be sure to choose one of the two developer package options when selecting your reward.\nAre you a producer, musician, or artist?\nWe want Here to redefine the way we listen to live music. As music lovers ourselves, we have optimized the Here system for live music and surrounded ourselves with some of the foremost composers and producers in the world.\nOur team at Doppler Labs has made huge strides but we can only get better with the input of sound designers, engineers, producers and musicians. Choose our producers package or sign up to get involved and stay up to date.\nEXPECTED DELIVERY\nWe expect to deliver Here to you in December 2015. We have calculated this date based on years of manufacturing experience. Your Here t-shirt and limited-edition numbered Here prints will be delivered to you by August 2015. If you\u2019re a developer, we plan to ship your DVT pair in late October. All deliveries to US addresses will be completed free of charge. Backers shipping to addresses outside of the US should add $30 to their pledge amount for shipping.\nREWARDS\nWARRANTY\nEach pair of Here buds comes with a 30-day (after we ship it) money-back guarantee and a 1-year limited warranty. You can find more information on our Return and Warranty Policy page.\nPRIVACY POLICY\nOur privacy policy can be found here.\nCONTACT US\nQuestions?

Makes an amazing holiday season gift!\nIncorporate Build Upons into the latest Star Wars spaceships!\n We are Lunchbox Electronics and we are creating Build Upons: Light up bricks to build upon your existing LEGO\u00ae creations.  Light up your robot, house, or spaceship! Our Build Upons are based on the smallest 1x1 brick we could fit an LED into to create elegant and flexible designs. The Build Upons system has three types of bricks: an LED brick, a power brick, and a bridge brick. \nYou can power an LED brick by stacking it directly on top of a power brick, or use the bridge brick to route power to LEDs throughout your design, allowing LEDs to be placed anywhere! \nThis 3D printed prototype shows an LED brick stacked on a bridge brick stacked on a power brick.\nThe bridge bricks allow for flexibility within the design. The below examples use the bridge bricks to route power from the battery pack to the LED bricks, wherever the LED bricks happen to be. The bridge bricks function even when turned 90 degrees!\nBuild a Helicopter!\nThese are only a few of the projects that highlight our bricks, we can't wait to see what you do!\nWe have created these prototype bricks, but we need you to get to a production run!\n                                                         Specs and Process\nThis product will be released as open source hardware upon shipping! Trust us - Alicia wrote the book on it.\nWe are using standard surface mount white LEDs in the bricks powered by a 4.5v battery pack. AA batteries not included. The bricks have metal running through the top and bottom creating connections where they stack. We have gone through several prototyped designs, improving each one. \nHere is a walk through of our design changes in R&D.\nEach iteration reflects a change to make our product more manufacturable and easy to assemble. We are now in our fourth major design iteration and ready for production. The earliest prototype was done with 3D printing, copper tape, and inserting LEDs into a plastic brick by hand, which was time consuming and tedious. In order to build lots of these bricks we need to invest in injection molding. \nThe Team\nThis was the only photo that Puppet had her eyes open.\n *Alicia Gibb* Alicia Gibb is the CEO of Lunchbox Electronics.

This is a must-have for any maker, and for anybody involved in hardware development!\nRewards\nRecent Press\nTech Marinade: \u201cSmart All-In-One Tool For Makers\u201d\nThe Mac Observer: \u201cWant to Turn Your iPad or iPhone into an Oscilloscope?\u201d\nGeeky Gadgets: \u201c100MS/s Open Source SmartScope Oscilloscope For Your Tablet\u201d \nOpenElectronics: \u201cSmartScope is reinventing the oscilloscope in Open Source\u201d\nStretch Goals\nKey Product Highlights\n2x100MS/s 45MHz Oscilloscope\n50MS/s Arbitrary Waveform Generator\nDigital logic analyzer at 100MS/s\nDigital waveform generator at 100MS/s\n200 waveforms/second data updates\nDemo movie\nMake sure to check out this movie, where we show the current status of the SmartScope:\nPLAY\n\nOpen source\nBy giving full access to the framework of the SmartScope, a whole new dimension of possibilities is opening up. In its most basic form, this open framework allows you to hook up your creation to the extension ports of the SmartScope and control it from your PC or smartphone.\nWhen you're taking on more advanced projects, you'll appreciate the full access you have to the powerful FPGA. The framework is based on FPGA registers which you can control from the PC or tablet, giving you full control over your FPGA from the first moment you're starting. Even more, since you can flash the FPGA through the USB controller, you don't need to invest in expensive programmers!\nEven more advanced projects can make use of the full-speed bi-directional data transfer capabilities, transferring data to or from your device.\nInitially, all source files of the full framework will be presented as a git repository, together with additional repositories focusing on extremely simple samples, showing how to start developing for each of the components of the SmartScope. This will hopefully create community branches, which will be added to our community site.\nWhy do you need a SmartScope?\nAn oscilloscope is the basic measurement device for anyone involved in hardware tinkering: it allows you to see how the voltage behaves at any point in your design, at any moment in time. Much like a breakpoint in software, which allows you to verify the value of all variables at a certain moment in time. The SmartScope should be the tool to optimize the debugging and development of your project.\nSmartScope should appeal to:\nArduino, Raspberry Pi & DIY enthusiasts: having access to an oscilloscope will greatly reduce your debugging time, as now you can literally see what's happening.\nMakers: using the open-source framework, you can use the SmartScope to control your inventions from your smartphone!\nStudents & Teachers: combining an oscilloscope, AWG and logic analyzer into a single mobile device makes the SmartScope a great addition to any student lab desk. Its open-source framework can serve both as example, as well as starting place for your code. You're encouraged to publish working projects on our community page at www.lab-nation.com!\nProfessional hardware engineers: even though this page is strongly aimed towards makers and hardware enthusiast, the SmartScope was born from an analysis of what performance is required to visualize any job but the extreme high-end -- such as DDR or RF implementations. Therefore, we're sure that any electronics engineer will appreciate the combination of performance and versatility offered by the SmartScope.\nCompatibility - Cross Platform\nWe're proud to announce that the SmartScope is the world's first instrument to work on iOS, Android, Windows, Linux and OSX! This true cross-platform-compatibility was achieved by choosing for the Xamarin framework from the very beginning of UI development. As a result, the SmartScope works on virtually all PCs, laptops, tablets and smartphones.\nGraphical User Interface\nOn all existing USB oscilloscopes, the software clearly has been an afterthought. Not so for the SmartScope! While competitors try to imitate traditional scopes by literally demanding the user to rotate knobs with a mouse, the SmartScope reinvents the way we will operate oscilloscopes: by making full use of the touchscreen!\nThe PC software is identical to the mobile version. With intuitive operations (scroll to zoom or simply drag a rectangle, dragging to reposition) and innovative features (window pops to foreground on trigger) it's our mission to continually provide you with the software you need to aid your projects.\nWhy is the cost so low?\nIt's LabNation's vision to open up the market of professional electronics measurement equipment to everyone. At $179 we believe there's no one out there offering a comparable scope. If you add the AWG, logic analyzer capabilities, intuitive software AND pioneering Android/iOS support, it is clear that the price could have been far higher. \nBy giving everyone access to a quality development and debugging instrument, we hope to contribute to the increasing speed at which amazing projects are making the transition from ideas to prototypes!\nWill the SmartScope work on my smartphone/tablet?\nThe SmartScope is the world's first instrument targeting compatibility with both iOS and Android. Although the required functionality (USB-OTG) is becoming a standard for Android devices the past few years, we were not able to get cooperation from Apple (yet ;). As such, our team set out to start from jailbroken iOS devices, and hack our way to the USB controller, which we eventually succeeded in. However, this means the SmartScope will only be recognized in case you apply a jailbreak patch to your iOS smartphone (which is a free, legal software operation that takes 10 minutes of your time). \nOn Android, USB-OTG is supported since Android v3.1, however it depends on the age and quality of your phone whether USB-OTG was implemented correctly. There are sites describing how to check for USB-OTG functionality, in case you want to be sure.\nMore specifically:\nWindows: driver available for XP, Win7, Win8\nOSX: supported, no driver needed (uses generic USB driver)\nLinux: supported, no driver needed (uses generic USB driver)\nAndroid: tested and verified on $52 Q88 tablet, Sony Xperia Z. More will be tested soon, but no problems expected as phones/tablets either support USB openly or not.\niOS: requires 5-minute legal software jailbreak patch. Tested and verified on iPad1, iPad2, iPhone 5, iPhone 5S. Will not work on iPhones 1,2,3 as they simply don't have a USB chip.\nPower/Sync port\nThe Power/Sync port is nothing more than a microUSB port, whose purpose is twofold:\nIn case your tablet/smartphone is running low on battery, you can power the SmartScope through this port. This can be done using any standard microUSB charger cable.\nMore advanced, we have foreseen the possibility to connect multiple SmartScopes together. In such case, synchronisation between the different SmartScopes is essential. This can be achieved easily by connecting both devices through their Power/Sync port using the cable provided in the 4-channel reward package.\nSpecifications\nLabNation team\nKey members at January 2014:\nRiemer Grootjans: Ex-whiz-kid Riemer always believed he would be a game developer, until his master thesis convinced him of the beauty of electronics. After going for a PhD on real-time 3D cameras, he co-founded a company designing 3D cameras now distributed by several major California-based companies. As such, he had the rare opportunity to lead a hardware patent from prototype to mass-production. At the same time, he created the largest site with tutorials on XNA, reaching more than 7000 daily pageviews and 2000 registered community members. Additionally, Riemer authored 3 books on XNA with positive reviews. He received the Microsoft MVP award in 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010. \nProf. Maarten Kuijk: Maarten is the live version of Wikipedia of Electronics. His research project have resulted in two spin-offs which have grown to a total of 120 employees, of which one has recently been acquired by Microchip in November 2013. Nevertheless, he stays true to his passion: teaching parttime classes as Professor to Master students in Electronical Engineering at the University of Brussels. Maarten acts as mentor to the SmartScope project. \nGlan Li: Born and educated in China, Glan was intrigued by the fundamental beauty of electronics. After finishing his Master in Electronical Engineering and working on various electronical projects, Glan was given responsability over a production line assembling more than 1 million camera devices per month. As such, he carries a wealth of experience in the areas of manufacturing and quality assurance.\nBruno Buyssens: After obtaining a Master in Business Engineering, Bruno pursued several technical jobs before refocusing towards marketing. He joined Sony and quickly moved towards Key Account Manager, dealing with distributors on a daily basis. Next to that, Bruno is well-known in the entrepreneurial scene, constantly looking for new business ideas and eager to launch his own start-up. With LabNation, he is looking forward to take a more leading role.\nWhere we are today\nAfter about a year of research and development, we produced the first prototype in March 2013, a second version in August and third one in October. In November a small batch of 10 final products was produced in China under Glan's approving eye.\nThanks to the early production of 10 fully operational SmartScopes we now can say that everything is in place to start up full production -- what we're missing at this point is your strong backing to put the SmartScope into production. Software is feature-complete and validated to stream data on all platforms, while we keep developing to bring it closer to a first distributable version.  \nProduction Plan  \nWe didn't want to launch our Kickstarter before having a fully working and validated product. This took us more than a year and 3 iterations, but at this moment we have produced 10 fully functioning SmartScopes, meaning the SmartScope is ready to put into production.\nHowever, we are planning one additional iteration after the end of our campaign: this allows us to include the best and most interesting ideas coming from your comments. After all, who knows how far possible stretch goals could take us? :)", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhen bringing a hardware product from idea to reality, it is easy to think about what the product should and shouldn't do. However, when it comes to manufacturing, there are many more things to take into account: suppliers, reliability tests, calibration, production and certification all require experience and dedication.Therefore, it is no surprise that many hardware projects are facing delays, especially in the later phases of production. Here are the main root causes of such delays, and how we are preventing them:\n\n- Need for more iterations. \nMany projects launch their Kickstarter campaign based on a first working prototype. Not so for the SmartScope: we are showing you fully functional and validated prototypes, which took us 3 iterations.\n\n- Link with the Factory.\nWe are happy to have Glan in our team with who we have been working for several years, bringing us the invaluable manufacturing experience. \n\n- Certification\nBefore you can ship out products,, it is legally required to go through a full list of challenging certifications. We are lucky yo have specialists in our team that have taken the lead in the whole certification process of USB devices.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #36", "update_userinfo": "All Kickstarter SmartScopes have been shipped!", "update_content": "We have some great news for you.

Kera is a young girl who accidentally stumbles upon a secret ability: her tears bring people back to life. However, there is one caveat: when she brings someone back to life, she ages by multiple years.\nWe start off the story with 6-year-old Kera who discovers that her goldfish has died. This is her first experience with death, and as she cries her tears fall into the fishbowl. \nKera Age 6 (preliminary artwork)\nThe next day the fish is revived, but Kera wakes up to find herself 9 years old. Now that she's discovered her power, Kera must make a choice: should she use her power for the greater good even though there's a high probability that she will lose an unknown number of years of her own life?\nWhy This Project?\nThe Rigamo universe seamlessly spans both a short film called Rigamo and a comic book series based on Kera, the main character. The short film is to be written and directed by Che Grayson with special animation and visual effects done by Sharon De La Cruz. The art in the comic book is to be done by Sharon with a story written by Che. Our cumulative vision ensures that Rigamo will be an interesting, multifaceted project focused on promoting positive characters from under-represented communities whose stories deal with current social issues.\nThrough Rigamo, we want to promote positive images of young black girls in the visual mediums of both film and print media. We also wanted to dive into the more personal themes of mourning and healing within those Black and Latino communities.\nWe are experimenting with a storytelling experience in which we follow Kera Moore through the discovery of her newfound power which begins in a 6 minute film that ends on a cliffhanger and continues through volume 1 of the comic book. We hope you're down to join us for the ride!\nFunding\nWe already have a full third of our budget in the form of a grant from NYU's Graduate Student Organization and are attempting to raise the rest with this Kickstarter campaign which will cover:\n- Costumes and production design to help bring the vision to life\n- Transportation for cast and crew\n- Food for cast and crew\n- Price of film stock and film development\n- Pay for film festival submission fees so we can get this story to a greater audience. \nWe really appreciate the time you've taken to read about our project and we hope that you are as excited as we are to work towards paving the way for a new black female superhero.\nRigamo is about pushing the boundaries of how we experience stories. Every little bit you can give us not only goes directly towards the film and comic, but will be the catalyst for a project that can expand and take a life of it's own.

It's the first film made in Lesotho, about the Basotho, and spoken in the native Sesotho language. It's won seven awards at international film festivals thus far, and is scheduled for theatrical release in South Africa in April 2014 (details for American release are still pending). For the trailer and more info, please go to our website - www.forgottenkingdomthemovie.com\nThe roadshow will begin with a gala premiere at the Ster-Kinekor cinema in Maseru on March 1st, and then we'll travel with the film to the Lesotho towns of Semonkong, Roma, Leribe, Mokhotlong, Morija, Mohale's Hoek, Malealea, Quthing, and more. Following Lesotho, we'll travel to the South African townships of Diepsloot and Soweto to screen the film there. In all of these locations, we'll show the film on a huge inflatable movie screen. Our mission is to share this story with as many people in Lesotho and South Africa possible. We'll be going off road, to remote mountain villages. Many of these people have never seen a film before, let alone one that's set in their own country, and told in their own language!\nOur roadshow crew is made up of American, South African, and Basotho volunteers. Expenses include the renting of vehicles, screening gear (screen, projector, sound gear, tents, etc), food and lodging, travel costs, etc. Please support this cause by making a donation!

My name is Heather Weston.  I am a photographer living in New York City. The idea for AT HOME came together out of living in a 450 square foot apartment with my family in Brooklyn.  I became intrigued by how other people were doing it. How were they living in their apartments, brownstones, houses? How were they using their space?\nI quickly began to formulate the idea of visiting people. Acquaintances, close friends, family members and creating a photographic portrait essay with people I know living together as a family.  My plan was to visit one family every week for the whole year! 52 weeks equals 52 families. I completed the task and recorded my results along the way on my blog.\nThe images from AT HOME were all taken in 2011.  Now in March 2014, I have the opportunity to exhibit this work at the Invisible Dog's Glass House in Brooklyn, New York.  \nAT HOME is about connecting people and exploring the spaces in which we all live.  I have some great rewards for all you supporters. The funds raised will be used for printing and framing as many images from the year as possible.

It tastes great and gives back! \n\"It takes rocks and gravel, baby... to make a solid road\" \u2013 Bob Dylan\nWhat is our plan?\nOur vision at R&G is to build our membership of coffee drinkers, by selling limited edition coffee tins and having refill coffee sent fresh and direct from the roaster to your door. Our goal of $20,000 on Kickstarter will give us the resources to:\nPrint first batch labels, tins, stickers, T-shirts and Mugs\nRoast the first batch of delicious coffee and send it out to you\nPay our talented artist, web designer and videographer\nCustom build a Rocks & Gravel Coffee cart for pour over (Chemex) coffee\nSet up our office and put systems in place for customer service\nWhat is our product?\nWe like to keep it simple. We have one roast to start with. We have chosen a Full City Roast, which is in between a medium and dark roast, perfect when prepared as a pour over (Chemex) or as a cold brew. Our coffee is also delicious as espresso or any way you like it. \nThere are two ways to order it:\nLimited edition collectible tins (12 OZ) for $18.99\nDiscount refills (10 OZ) for just $11.99\nOur bean in a recyclable tin, fresh from the roaster\nWhy is our coffee so delicious?\nMost coffees today are roasted too long and become burnt and bitter. Our beans are wet washed and sun dried to minimize toxins, offering coffee drinkers a clean caffeine high with no jittery feelings. \nOur Full City roast\nOur roaster doesn't burn the bean, which is what happens with a French roast or higher. Instead, our Full City Roast has the right balance of bite and aroma, bold and chocolatey with a smooth and smoky flavor. Great for pour over single cup or in the Chemex for multiple cup brews.\nFull of natural oils and anti-oxidants\nHere's some nerdy facts about our bean:\nCooperative:  La Florida Cooperativa\nCertifications:  Fair Trade, Smithsonian Bird Friendly\nRegion:  The Chanchamayo province in the Junin region of Central Peru\nAltitude:  1,200 \u2013 1,400 meters\nVariety: Bourbon, Catimor, Typica, Caturra, and Pache\nHarvest: March \u2013 August\nOur clean beans before the roast\n How does our coffee give back?\nOur coffee give back in four main ways:\nPlanet friendly \u2013 our packaging is 100% recyclable and reusable\nCommunity & animal friendly \u2013 our coffee beans are fair trade, USDA certified organic, 'bird friendly' and shade grown\nCustomer friendly \u2013 Rocks & Gravel Members get $1 off their next coffee tin order when they refer a friend\nArtist friendly \u2013 our artist, Stef Mitchell, receives a royalty for every tin sold\nWhat do you get if you make a pledge today?\nAny pledge amount counts. Find the one that best suits you. Get started with a Limited Edition Pledge Tin or join the R&G Crew with a quarterly or yearly membership! \nWe hope that you will get involved and become part of the R&G crew, by making a pledge to get a whole year's supply of fresh coffee for just $250. Annual membership comes complete with three different limited edition tins and nine additional monthly refills. On top of that we will gift you a Rocks & Gravel T-shirt, limited edition Mug and Pour Over Cup. We think it is a killer deal! \nWhat are our most popular kinds of pledges?\n'Pledge' Edition R&G Coffee Tin (12 OZ) - $25 - limited edition signed collectible tin of R&G coffee (shipping incl.) \n3 month membership - $100 - 1 tin + 2 months of refills (comes with a free Pour Over Cup) (shipping incl.) \n1 year membership - $350 - 3 tins + 9 months of refills (plus a free R&G T-shirt, Mug, & Pour Over Cup) (shipping incl.) \nFor memberships: Our gift of a Pour Over Mug for single cup brews\nPrototype R&G limited edition Boarder T-shirt\nPrototype R&G Limited Edition Bear Mug\nWhat are some special pledge rewards?\nIf you like 'dream catchers' our chief of communications Sophie Ward will hand make you one for just $75. It will come with your first specialty R&G coffee tin.\nIf you are a Kin fan, you can pledge $10 and receive a limited edition cover EP by Isaac and Thorald Koren of The Kin with an R&G collectible sticker. If you are even more of a Kin fan, you can pledge $1500, receive a yearly R&G membership, and enjoy your very own 'Musical Robbery' by The Kin in NYC. \nIf you are a big fan of our artist, Stef Mitchell, you can pledge $750 to receive your own original full size Stef Mitchell original artwork. This last pledge comes with a full yearly R&G membership.\nFor the big spenders, we have the option of your own private 'Salon Dinner Party' event hosted by our team for a pledge of $2500 or higher.\nWhy do we want to make a coffee cart?\nWe intend to build our own wooden coffee cart for pour over coffee, so we can bring R&G coffee to the streets! This will fit two people, one to measure, grind and prepare the individual pour over cups of delicious coffee, and one person to handle the customers. \nThe cart will tweet its location @rocksandgravel and will also travel to music festivals, cycling races, local markets and busy street corners. We think it is a unique cart in that it is focused on pour over coffee and offers a freshly brewed cup of coffee to every customer.\nPrototype Pour Over Coffee Cart\nReclaimed wood Pour Over Bar for the cart\nWhat is our story? \nRocks & Gravel Coffee began last year while I was cycling along the Delaware river with my brother and partner in crime, Thorald Koren. \nOn our ride we stumbled across a local organic coffee roaster. After meeting the two brothers who run the roaster, we began discussing the possibility of bringing to life a coffee that tastes great and also gives back. \nIn collaboration with artist Stef Mitchell, we designed a tin that is both collectible, reusable and gives back both locally and globally. \nWill you help us build a solid road?\nNone of this can happen without you. Our goal is to raise $20,000 to produce the first batch of coffee and tins, pay our wonderful artist, build the website, and send our product to your door. Check out our pledges below to join the Rocks & Gravel crew.\n                                                 THANK YOU!\nFounder, Isaac Koren\nBrand Director, Thorald Koren\nArtist, Stef Mitchell\nChief of Communications, Sophie Ward\nProduct Manager, Ashley Maher\nBusiness Development, Georgina Koren", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are many challenges that face new businesses:\n\nHOW RELIABLE IS THE SUPPLY?\nWe have made sure that we have a solid relationship with our local roaster so that we can guarantee delivery of fresh coffee to our drinkers.

Our Full City Roast is best and most pure when prepared in a 'pour over' set, so that is why we include a pour over set in both the 3 month and yearly membership pledges.\n\nHOW IS YOUR CUSTOMER SERVICE?\nOur team, the Rocks & Gravel Crew, are fully engaged to make customer service both personal and enjoyable.

What sets this show apart is that for the first time the guitar itself is being used as a projection screen. The show opens as a creation story where the notes and sounds create the images. It then broadens into an exploration of the guitar where we learn that it is shape shifter, it has travelled all over the world, it has a background with friends and family, and it even has an internal skeleton and nervous system. Finally, we see that music creates the musician, and the guitar creates the guitarist.\nI need you to help me and visual arts company, Glowing Pictures, produce the debut show, which will happen at BRIC House in Brooklyn, NY, on March 6, and to build something that I can take on the road and share with you all.\nOne of the things I've tried to do in my career as a guitarist is to push the limits of the guitar far beyond what is expected. I'm always employing new techniques, tunings, and approaches in order to coax out sounds that haven't been heard before. This show is an extension and exploration of that philosophy. If the guitar can show any picture or wear any kind of skin then how will I relate to it as an instrument that I'm so comfortable with, and is it possible for an audience to see such a familiar object in an entirely new way? Those are the questions that The Neck tries to answer.\nAll the images you will see in this show will be original, from the digital creations and animations that Glowing Pictures invents, to videos and movies that we will produce ourselves. This takes an enormous amount of time and effort, and your help will go towards hiring the best team possible and making sure that everyone can spend all the time they need on achieving the most artistic result.\nThis project has required me to write all new music to play live, and we want to record an album of the soundtrack to accompany the show. This will involve all of the usual costs of making and mastering an album, and your contribution will help greatly here.\nHere are some of the pieces of equipment we will need to purchase:\nHD projectors\nmapping software\nstill/video camera\ncustom large screen with portable stands\ndedicated computer to run the software\ncustom guitar effects pedal to control sound of the guitar\nHDMI cables and equipment stands\nThank you so much for taking the time to watch this video and read through this page.

Thank you so much for your support.\nHello Ruby wouldn't have happened without you all. It started as my sideproject, but grew into something so much bigger.\nThe campaign is now over and this page is frozen. You can see everything that happened in the campaign - but it is all out of date and you can't back the project anymore. If you're interested in Ruby's world, or want to pre-order the book, head over to www.helloruby.com. I'll be waiting you over!\nHugs,\n- Linda\n--\nAnd here\u2019s the story that started it all:\nMy name is Linda Liukas. I have spent the last three years teaching programming and making the world of technology more approachable for the millions through co-founding a non-profit called Rails Girls and working at Codecademy.\nNow, I want to combine software with storytelling. I want to write and illustrate a book for young children about the magical world of technology - Hello Ruby. \nTwitter: @lindaliukas  \nBlog: http://helloruby.com\n----\nUPGRADES: EVERYONE who has pledged for the first hardcover book or above will ALSO get a digital version of the book and workbook.\nSTRETCH-GOAL 250 000: If we hit 250 000, I'll write a Parents Guide to complement the workbook and make it available as a download.\nSTRETCH-GOAL 500 000: If we hit 500 000, I'll extend Ruby's world into a mobile app. Think magic!\n---\nAs seen on\nHello Ruby kids' coding book raises $185k (and counting) on Kickstarter. (27.1.2014)\nKickstarter loves this children's book that gets kids excited about coding (23.1.2014)\nCan this children's book help make the Internet a better place? (29.1.2014) \nChildren's book Hello Ruby teaches 4 to 7 year olds how to code  (28.1.2014)\n Book That Teaches Kids to Code raises 250k on Kickstarter (4.2.2014)\n Getting Girls Into Programming, One Children's Book At A Time (4.2.2014)\nThe story\nRuby is a small girl with a huge imagination. She stomps and stumbles around her own little world while her dad is traveling. On her adventures, Ruby makes friends with the lonely Snow Leopard, visits castles made of windows, and solves problems with the wise penguins. She bakes gingerbreads with the green robots and throws a garden party with... well, if you like to hear the rest of the story, I need your help.\nRuby's world is an extension of the way I've learned to see technology. It goes far beyond the bits and bytes inside the computer. This is the story of what happens between the ones and zeros, before the arrays and the if/else statements. The book and workbook are aimed for four to seven year olds. \nI believe stories are the most formative force of our childhood. Everyone has a book that made the world seem beautiful and full of possibility. My book is about little Ruby.\nRuby and her friends\nWhy this matters?\nCode is the 21st century literacy and the need for people to speak the ABC of Programming is imminent. Our world is increasingly run by software and we need more diversity in the people who are building it.\nMore importantly, writing software is about expression, creativity - and practical application. Our kids should learn to bend, join, break and combine code in a way it wasn't designed to. Just as they would with crayons and paper or wood and tools. I believe there's plenty to learn in programming logic and culture before showing children a single screen.\nHere's what I want to do\n Hello Ruby is a children's book that comes with an activity book. The two books teach the very foundations of technology through stories and activities that serve as a simple template for all future learning. The book and workbook are aimed for four to seven year olds. \nWhy a storybook?\n We all have treasured childhood stories that have affected the way we see reality. Instead of only focusing on how applications are built or code is constructed, I want to tell about the architects, principles and personalities behind software. And I believe the best way to tell this story is through a book that will be read with children and parents at night, and live in the bookshelf for years to come.\nHello Ruby will be a classic journey of discovery that teaches the readers about different people working together, how problems can be solved in small sequences and how remixing and sharing helps everyone.\nIllustrations are as important as the story. My book will be full of detail and whimsy, with cutaways and magical moments, a world where everything is not apparent at once.\nHardcover book, 8 x 8 inches and 32 pages \nTraditional story of friendship, being different .. and technology. \nWhy an activity book?\nThe activity book teaches kids early programming skills. It\u2019s designed to be enjoyed by a kid alone, but can also be worked through with an adult. And best of all - the workbook is designed to be doodled, wrecked and drawn all over. \nThe foundational knowledge structures, like sequences, variables, patterns, loops, lists, conditionals, operators and events. Taught through exercises of dot-to-dot, pairs, odd-one-out, all from Ruby's world. \nA sprinkle of software culture, by teaching them to abstract and modularise, work iteratively and incrementally as well as encouraging them to reuse and remix work. \nCreativity and DIY attitude. Tons of doodles, logic puzzles and even a foldable miniature laptop that allows the kid to peek inside a computer. \nThe Budget\nThe book will be hardcover, 8x8 inches and 32 pages. The activity book is  16 pages and paperback. To make the minimum order of 1000 copies, I need you.\nYou'll get a lovely old-fashioned storybook that introduces Ruby and the other characters. In addition there will be a workbook with puzzles, exercises and additional materials for the parent to teach web literature for the little ones. \nI'm writing and illustrating all of this myself. Most of the funds will be production costs: printing the books and workbooks and hiring an editor. And you'll get to be a part of the journey of a first time author. \nBreakdown of budget\nEditor for spelling and storyline\nPurchase of fonts\nBook and workbook layout design\nObtaining ISBN numbers, registration fees and costs associated with getting listed in online bookstores\nProduction of the books \nShipping \nWho am I?\nPrior to writing this book, I co-founded Rails Girls, a global non-profit teaching programming to tens of thousands of women in over 160 cities. I also worked at Codecademy as one of the first employees. I first got excited about programming when I was 13 years old and madly in love with Al Gore. However, it took me almost ten years to learn more than the basics, so beginners are close to my heart. \nI'm a Ruby Hero 2013 and the Digital Champion of Finland. \nSee my talk at Heroku Waza 2013 on Ruby and a talk on girls & programming in Railsberry 2012. \nTell me more about Ruby!\n Gladly. I've actually already drawn a few of her adventures here.\nRuby is one of the best little girls I know.  \nShe has family all around the world. Her father is from Japan, but she has aunts and uncles and siblings and cousins everywhere.  Ruby loves her family, wants to be helpful and make people around her happy. \nSometimes Ruby is a little bossy. She says things like \u201cGet me the milk from the lowest shelf of the fridge\u201d and \u201cCombine two spoonfuls of cocoa with the milk\u201d. \nRuby learns quickly. If you show her how to make her bed, she\u2019ll have no trouble doing it a hundred times over. \nAnd she\u2019s independent: Ruby doesn\u2019t like other people telling her how to clean her room, only what should be done, while she prefers to figure out the process herself. \nAll the adults say Ruby is a sensible, nice kid. But sometimes she can be mischievous. If you\u2019re not very precise in ordering your chocolate, the kitchen might end up be flooding with hot cocoa. \nRuby\u2019s favorite things in the world are her precious gems. The colorful, glittering gemstones are presents from all over the world. When Ruby closes her eyes the gems become magic and help her do things she never could have done alone. \nRuby's friends are pretty mischievous too. Androids are messy. Snowleopard doesn't want to play with other kids. Penguins are booksmart but sometimes hard to understand. \nOh, and the coolest thing about Ruby? She and her friends have their own secret language. Can you guess what happens when Ruby says: \n  puts \u201chip hip hooray \u201c*5\nIn Ruby\u2019s world there are words that mean things and words that do things. And magic happens every day.\nPast updates\nFri Jan 24, 2014\nOh wow. What a day.\nYou are amazing. During the first 24 hours of the campaign we surpassed $100k. I'm so excited to be able to work on Ruby's world with all of this overwhelming support.\nEvery additional dollar will go towards building the magical world of Ruby. A larger budget means I can commit to making everything so much more better. Let\u2019s do this! Thank you so much for your support.\nHugs,\n- Linda", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI\u2019ve spent the last weeks learning everything I can about authoring, publishing and printing. The timelines for printing and shipping something this big are very different from the project I started with. It\u2019s all very exciting, but also all very new. Luckily I have great people helping me. \n\nI know it sucks to wait for more than 6 months for a book, but for normal industry printed books the cycle is even longer. Here's my plan: \n\n1. Making the book \nThis is the first time I\u2019m doing a children's book. I\u2019ve talked with several Kickstarter authors about the process as well as other children's book authors. I've almost written the story and sketched the pages into a storyboard format. Before starting with the final artwork, I'd like to hire a native english speaking editor to go through the story with me. With all of the support I can also work together with an art director. I hope you\u2019ll love every single page of both books as I've loved making them. \n\n2. Printing the book\n When the book leaves my desk, there\u2019s still a lot of things that need to happen. My biggest concern is the shipping, but also printing takes time. \n\nBoth the storybook and the workbook are industry standard, so production problems shouldn't be an issue. Now that the Kickstarter is ending, I'll know the number of books I can afford and where I should be printing them. \n\n3) Shipping the book\nShipping is expensive and always a bit of an unknown. This is why I\u2019m planning on shipping the books with Amazon and using their third party fulfilment services. If there are delays in shipping I\u2019ll keep everyone posted and try to share the e-book (as that\u2019s the one part I really can influence) as soon as possible with all the backers (excluding the 5 dollar pledge category). \n\nI\u2019m very committed to making this all happen and feel very privileged by all the support. I will keep you posted, all the way.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #24", "update_userinfo": "Love Letters for Computers \ud83d\udc8c", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #23", "update_userinfo": "How do computers talk to each other?

It can also be used with the Xbox 360 and Xbox One with the appropriate adapter. The logical mapping or connections between the sip & puff sensors and the signals sent to the host are configurable by the user and can be changed between preconfigured profiles, while playing, to match different situations in a game, as demonstrated in the video below:\nIn the Press:\nEngadget, Wired, Cnet, PhysOrg, VG24/7, Pocket-lint, Hot Hardware, EuroGamer, Polygon, Gizmag\nQuadStick Default Setup\n\nCustom Configurations:\nThe configuration of the QuadStick is stored in an internal Flash drive.  Configuration files are derived from specially formatted Google Drive Spreadsheets, and new configurations for different games or setups can be downloaded into the QuadStick while it is connected to a PS3 or PC.\nThe default configuration file works well for many games, but it is helpful to have specialized configurations for certain games or to better match up with a player's preferences, physical abilities or range of motion.\nConfiguration spreadsheets can be easily shared on-line between users and/or caregivers.  Users can quickly download a new configuration generated by themselves or someone else using the PS3 web browser.  Users can easily contribute and trade configuration spreadsheets with each other. Multiple configuration files can be stored in the internal flash and then selected during play.\nVoice commands:\nUsing Dragon Naturally Speaking (DNS) or Windows Speech Recognition (WSR) and a collection of free software packages, it is possible to add voice commands to your options for controlling the game. \nThe voice command vocabulary allows the user to speak the name of a control, such as Circle or Triangle, and, optionally, give a command to press it for specific time periods or strength.  It also allows sequential commands, with predetermined timing, to be triggered with just one word or short phrase.  Essentially, any of the output signals that can be activated with a QuadStick sensor input can also be triggered by a voice command.\nAlternate words for commands like Reload, Jump, Fire, Aim Rifle, Crouch Down can be scripted as game specific aliases to match up with controller layouts that differ between games.  For instance, in Call of Duty, Jump is X; in the original Bio Shock, Jump is Triangle.  A common vocabulary allows the player to concentrate on the action, not the specific controller button.\nAnother example is in MLB13 where \"Pick off first\" (or second or third) triggers a long L2 press followed by quick double clicks of Circle, Triangle or Square to perform that play.  These commands can be created or altered by the user.\nVoice commands are also used to help manage the QuadStick operation itself, to load new configuration files, to change the active mode or to temporarily re-map one or two buttons to the lip sensor.  While not required to successfully use the QuadStick, voice commands make it easier and simpler to perform certain actions that otherwise might require a specific configuration profile.\nThe full User Manual is available on the QuadStick website.\nTop View\nHow the QuadStick came to be:\nMy first exposure to assistive technologies happened when my mom had ALS. When her speech became affected, we bought her a computerized speech system.  When movement became difficult, she started using devices to help her continue to use the computer.  Ever since, being a designer of digital control systems, I've searched for an idea for something I could design that would help to alleviate problems for people like my mom in a way that was not being adequately addressed by the market.\nWhen I read a newspaper story about Ken Yankelevitz and his Quad Control Joystick, I knew I had found that idea.  Video games today are as much about the social aspects as they are about presenting an intellectual puzzle or entertainment, and, developing a tool that would allow disabled gamers to play those games at a high level would allow them to more fully participate in that world.  There were several solutions that let quadriplegics use a computer fairly well; but for modern game consoles, where speed and timing are critical, few products seemed to really solve the problem, especially for gamers with very limited mobility.  Ken has been making video game joysticks for quadriplegics since the 1980's but was getting into his seventies, and due to health reasons, has stopped taking orders for new joysticks.\nI contacted Ken, and through a series of visits and phone calls, the general design requirements for the QuadStick began to emerge.   I first looked at using one of the off-the-shelf cpu modules, like Arduino or a Beagle variant, but there was always something that mismatched with the application requirements, so I ended up choosing an ARM CPU I was familiar with from my work at Cisco.  The first prototypes were about twice the size of the current design and included things like back-lit displays and more I/O, but it would have been about twice as expensive to produce.\nFirst prototype of the QuadStick\n3D renderings of the first prototype design can be found here and the second design here\nMatt Victor, one of Ken's longtime customers and a C1 quadriplegic, who has no movement or feeling from the neck down, contacted me and volunteered to help test the QuadStick.  He's been using it daily for more than six months. Over that time, after operating the QuadStick with only voice commands and his mouth, he gave feedback and critiques that have resulted in many changes to the design and operation of the QuadStick, and we feel it is finally ready to offer to others.\nGetting the mouthpiece shape and design right has been the biggest challenge.  We have tested many different materials and shapes to arrive at a mouthpiece that is both accurate and comfortable to use for long periods of game play.\nMouthpiece experiments\nWe tried over a dozen different mouthpiece designs, with features like bite pressure sensors (which proved impracticable for a C1 who can't move forward to use it), and finally selected a three hole mouthpiece with an analog lip position sensor, which has worked out very well.  We also experimented with different materials, molds and ways to produce the mouthpiece before arriving at the latest 3D printed version.\nHardware details: Joystick & Mouthpiece\nQuadStick front view\nThree Sip/Puff tubes\nLip position sensor\nX-Y position\nPush switch\nAdditional Sip/Puff tube on right side of the joystick.\nFive Blue/Red Status Leds used to indicate: Sensor activation, active configuration profile, boot process, self test and USB connection status.\nFour Green Status Leds: External outputs status on top pair, external inputs status on bottom pair.\nRear Panel:\nQuadStick Rear Panel\nUSB-B connector for power and/or data connection to Host device.\nUSB-A connector for hosting second daisy chained gamepad (not implemented) or Auxiliary Digital Inputs for 8-way external joystick.\nOutput Jack: 3mm stereo jack with two optically isolated outputs.\nInput Jack: 3mm stereo jack which can connect to two switches or 4-way joystick or TTL-3.3 Volt Serial Port or as a Secondary logic level output.\nSpeaker for audio feedback.\nInfrared Transmitter for A/V equipment remote control (future use).\nAMPS mount hole pattern.\nConnectivity:\nThe QuadStick mainly uses a USB connection to connect to a host console or PC but also has a Bluetooth module that can be used to connect to a second device.  The Bluetooth module can be configured as a Human Interface Device (HID - generic joystick, keyboard and/or mouse) or as a serial connection. \nThe primary use cases for the Bluetooth module are:\nSerial connection to PC for Voice command option\nHID device to a second host, while connected by USB to a primary host.  Which host receives commands can be changed on the fly.\nHID device for an Android tablet, while receiving power from either the tablet or USB charger.\nBluetooth limitations:\nPS3 Gamepad mode is not supported over Bluetooth, so the PS3 must always be used over the USB connection.\nHID and Serial port modes are mutually exclusive, and if the QuadStick is paired as one device type, it must be un-paired before changing to another type.\nThe Flash drive is not available through the Bluetooth\nThe 3mm external input connection can be used as a 3.3v Logic level serial port instead of the Bluetooth serial port for Voice applications.\nHost Platform USB limitations and caveats:\nThe Quadstick is a \"composite\" device:  it emulates multiple different devices (joystick, keyboard, mouse & flash drive) through a single connection.  The PC, Mac and PS3 allow access to all of these functions.  The situation is different, however, for other platforms. \nAndroid: the joystick, keyboard and mouse functions work fine.  The flash drive is not normally accessible unless the android device is \"rooted\" and special software installed.  This has not been tested. \nXbox 360/One: These hosts do not work directly with the QuadStick at all.  They use proprietary protocols to lock down access to their consoles against 3rd party USB devices, like the QuadStick.  There is however a device (http://controllermax.com/) that will allow the Joystick/Game Controller function of the QuadStick to work with these consoles. We have tested it with both the XBox 360 and XBox One.  Please note that the process of attaching a QuadStick to an Xbox requires plugging a wired native Xbox controller into the adapter first, then swapping that with the QuadStick's cable.  The mouse, keyboard and flash drive functions are not functional when used through an adapter.  For loading new configuration files, the quadstick will have to be connected to a host that supports the flash drive.\nPS4:  At this time there is no PS4 support for the Joystick function.  The keyboard, mouse and flash work fine.  ControllerMax (formerly CronusMax) is working on adding the PS4 to their product, but have no estimated delivery date.\nThe USB-A port is currently used for external switch inputs.  It *may* be used by a future firmware update to host a second controller to mix its signals with the QuadStick, but on units delivered for this Kickstarter, the USB-A host function will not be working.\nCurrent status:\nFive working prototypes have been built, and the firmware and configuration scripts have been stable for several months.  As a result of our testing, numerous improvements, such as adding Voice commands and swapping the bite sensor for a lip sensor, have been made as we worked through the requirements presented by various games.  Games like Call of Duty, Bio Shock, Journey, Assassin's Creed and Grand Turismo, plus several sports games have been successfully played.\nPrototype QuadStick without enclosure\nEdge view\nPrototype QuadStick PCB with Bluetooth module\nPCB Layout\nRewards:\nThe intangible reward of supporting the project while receiving nothing but \"thanks\" on a website or getting on a mailing list may not seem like much, but this whole project is driven by intangible reward.  When the idea to do this product popped into my head, there was no \"not doing it.\"  I was immediately all-in; because once you see the need for it, and you have the ability and means to do it, you can't ignore the idea.  Backing at the \"Karma\" level, for five or ten bucks or more, goes directly into making it possible to continue development of this product, to add new features and improvements in the manufacture of it. Thank you.\nT-shirts rewards and Kickstarter projects go together like PB&J.  Proudly show you helped launch a product that can really make a difference in someone's life.\nYou need this shirt\nThe backers of the first 25 units not only receive their QuadSticks first, they also have the opportunity to help shape the community of users at the ground floor.  While the default configuration works well for many games, some games present situations that require a custom configuration, like climbing a wall in Call of Duty.  Every new game where users identify these unique situations helps in creating configuration files that not only benefit them, but benefit new users that will follow them.  The choice of using a Google Spreadsheet as the core of the custom configuration process had as much to do with the ease of sharing the result as it did with the functionality.   Matt has worked out the configurations and strategies for a C1 playing numerous games.  The first 25 backers will benefit from that effort and can multiply it out for gamers with different ranges of motion, preferences and games.\nDon't need a QuadStick or know anyone who does?  Consider backing one and have it shipped to Able Gamers (ablergamers.com).  They will grant the QuadStick to a worthy disabled recipient.  When the fulfillment questionnaire goes out asking where to ship the reward, just enter their address.\nThe production units will follow starting two months after the first 25.  Backers at this level will determine if the QuadStick becomes a viable product.  The QuadStick is a specialized product for an under-served segment of the population.  For business reasons, the big game manufacturers have largely ignored this group of gamers who could be among their most fervent customers.  If QuadStick can someday convince the makers of the X-Box or PS4 to support its use with their consoles, it will be because of this group of supporters.\nThe QuadStick comes complete with a RAM Mount Suction base and 10 foot long USB cable so a person can get playing right away.\nRAM Mount and cable included so you can get playing right away\nPatron level backers at the $1000 and $5000 level.  You've got to ask yourself, why would you back some project like this for that kind of money?  I think because you can imagine that if you found yourself, or if you were the parent of a child, facing the reality and challenges of living as a quadriplegic, you'd want something like the QuadStick to exist, and you're in a position to help make that happen.  And we are right back to that intangible reward thing. \nProduction Plans:\nProduction plans are somewhat contingent on the results of the campaign.  The cost of electronic assembly is strongly dependent on economies of scale, so a decision on going to an assembly house vs doing the work in house will depend on the numbers.  The setup costs for an assembly house run needs to be amortized over enough units to justify itself, which is between 50 and 75 units.   In any event, the first 25 will be done in house using existing equipment.  The product was designed to be built using basic surface mount tools.\nBeginning of March:  Order all parts and the printed circuit boards.\nThe full parts lists, or bills of materials, have been uploaded to the various parts vendors, such as Arrow, Digikey, Mouser and Future; so once we know the quantity, the orders can be placed without delay.\nOrder the PCB boards.  The same vendor that fabricated the prototypes will be used.  The turn around time for PCBs can be selected so they arrive when needed.\nSend the CAD file, with all the cutouts and holes, to the enclosure vendor to have the covers machined.   Three week lead time.\nMachine the joystick arms and print the mouthpieces and centering spring holders while waiting for parts to arrive.    \nLate March:  Organize the incoming parts and load the manual pick and place parts carriers.  If using an assembly house for the subsequent deliveries, prepare kits of non-commodity parts for them.\nApril:  Begin assembly of the first 25 PCBs.  Order shipping materials and accessories, like RAM Mounts, cables, printed materials.\nMay:  Final mechanical assembly, test and shipment by the end of the month.  Start preparing for the next run.\nAcknowledgements, media clips used by kind permission:\nJane McGonigal: The game that can give you 10 extra years of life \nMusic: The Dead Vineyard, Signal Hill", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI have been designing and manufacturing microprocessor-based products for many years, mostly for the Building Automation, Energy Management and Process Control industries. In 1988, I co-founded Zeta Engineering Corp, as its chief engineer, which became Richards-Zeta in the mid-nineties, until it was purchased by Cisco Systems in 2009. I have worked in every technical aspect of product development, testing and manufacturing during that time and have been involved with numerous production runs, both large and small.\n\nDepending on how successful the campaign is, I will either assemble the QuadSticks myself or use a nearby assembly house. I have quotes for 50 and 100 piece builds, though lead time is not certain until an order is placed. \n\nThe ultimate scale of a Kickstarter campaign is unknown up front; a project can just meet its goal, or it can grow far beyond that. The specialized nature of QuadStick makes it even harder to predict. I've structured the reward delivery schedule to accommodate meeting both the basic goal and any substantial orders beyond that, by allowing a time gap between the delivery of the first 25 units and those that follow. This gives time to schedule for an assembly house to make the devices, should the demand present itself, or to make them in lower quantities with my own equipment at a reasonable rate and still meet the commitments.\n\nParts availability is always a concern for a hardware project. An assembly house has committed the CPUs for 50 units to be used in the project, and distributors have plenty of available stock for all the other critical sole sourced parts, like the pressure sensors & bluetooth module, for any foreseeable quantities.\n\nThe software and prototype hardware have been running reliably for several months. The PCB will be a new revision, but it is only slightly changed from the current prototypes.\n\n\nI chose 25 units for the first run because I feel that is a reasonable number of users to support in getting setup in the first wave of shipments.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #23", "update_userinfo": "This is the fourth aniversary of the Quadstick's kickstarter campaign", "update_content": "Back in 2011, when I read about Ken Yankelevitz and his Quad Control game controllers, I had no idea how much that would change my life.

Head over to memini.com for more information, and to place an order.\nThank you all backers!\nThanks to you, the meMINI wearable camera was successfully funded!\nThis Kickstarter page will be frozen on February 6, 2014.  To follow our journey ahead, check out our Twitter - @joinmemini, and Facebook - facebook.com/Memini\nEvery day, we share experiences with family and friends. As we struggle to retell the story to others later, we often regret not having captured it on film somehow. With meMINI, there\u2019s no longer any need for regret\u2026 \nmeMINI in the media\n  Mashable - Tech Radar - Engadget - Stuff.tv - Pocket Lint - Idealog\n Capture the past with Recall\nRecall gives you the ability to use hindsight. It allows you to save moments in high definition video, after they happen \u2013 because we understand that the best moments in life tend to happen without warning. \nCapturing once-in-a-lifetime memories and everyday moments while avoiding hours of unwanted video footage has never been easier. Those funny moments with your husband or wife, your child\u2019s \u201cfirsts,\u201d or the joke your friend just told - all can instantly be saved. \nMemories made easy with Magnatach \nUnderstanding that we\u2019re all different, our special Magnatach technology means how you wear meMINI is up to you. Attach your meMINI anywhere on your clothes or place it down to include yourself in the moment. Being so discreet, meMINI will help you capture a moment, not a performance. \nUniversal Mount\nWith the Universal mount you can use meMINI in your car, on your motorbike, bicycle. The universal mount that will work with most mounting systems out there that you currently own or that you can buy. Allowing you to mount meMINI on your dash, handlebars or helmet. Giving you the Ultimate in flexibility. Upgrade your pledge by $10 on any level to get one universal mount or $20 to get two!\nUpgrade your pledge by $10 on any level to get one universal mount or $20 to get two!\nUpgrade your pledge by $10 on any level to get one universal mount or $20 to get two! Upgrade your pledge by $10 on any level to get one universal mount or $20 to get two!\n Simplicity with performance\nWe believe we should all be able to capture life's moments quickly and easily, and have that video at our fingertips minutes later. We have approached the design of the meMINI user experience and camera with one goal in mind: keep it simple. \nWith it's wireless capabilities, cloud-based storage and innovative Recall technology, meMINI has eliminated the need to watch hours of unwanted footage or memory cards and handfuls of cords. meMINI will automatically transfer your moments to your meMINI.com profile. \nmeMINI comes in four colours - All Black, Black/Silver, Black/White and All White\nStunning on the outside and powerful on the inside, meMINI\u2019s technical features will allow us to add updates in the future, giving you more options to enhance your meMINI experience. With all that choice, you\u2019ll never miss a moment again.\nHigh Definition video \nWith image stabilisation and 1080 HD, your moments will be lifelike, for life.\nOperation\nmeMINI is a reinvention. We\u2019re taking things that are familiar to you and making them better. Camera functionality is being incorporated with our revolutionary recall technology and the magnatach capability is replacing traditional mounting systems, giving you the ability to do with meMINI, whatever you like. \nCommuter mode\nChange the record mode in the app from Recall to Commuter, and meMINI will safeguard your journey. If meMINI senses a fall or rapid stop, meMINI will activate Recall using it's inbuilt accelerometer. You can also activate recall manually by pushing the Recall button for those close calls or for moments you are a bystander to. Not to worry if you do take a fall, meMINI is capable of withstanding most knocks, bumps and is water resistant.\nSynchronise your moments with a twin pack\nSome moments are worth capturing from two perspectives, so we have added another pledge level with a great deal, so you can buy two meMINI\u2019s. They connect together over the built-in Bluetooth link, so when a moment happens, the push of one meMINI\u2019s recall button will activate multiple meMINI\u2019s. Capturing one moment in time, perfectly synced together.  Check out our footage with two meMINI's on commuter mode while driving..\nStoring and sharing your memories \nWe know meMINI captures amazing videos of great moments, and that this video needs to be shared - to loved ones and sometimes, to the world - so we have created a unique sharing and storage service to run alongside meMINI. \nWith meMINI integrated to our cloud-based storage service, you can store and share moments easily right after they take place. \nYour smartphone allows you to control your camera, your footage and its chosen destination easily. meMINI\u2019s app means you can connect loved ones to your chosen moments whenever and wherever you choose. \nThen there\u2019s the meMINI community. An online platform where meMINI will wirelessly and automatically send your videos, where you can store or share captured memories via email, on social media or with other meMINI.com users. You can even share your moments with the whole meMINI.com community.\nmeMINI Ta Moko\nThis is Pip Hartley's design of meMINI Ta Moko . Pip runs Mana Moko and has custom sketched this design for this one of a kind camera. All lines will be laser etched into a dark green meMINI camera, which will only ever be made for this Kickstarter campaign. Here is one we 3D printed to show you how amazing it looks. \nCamera specifications\nRewards\nDevelopment\nInitial prototype and testing\nOur first prototype utilised one of Teknique\u2019s existing cameras with a software modification to enable Recall, Teknique modified their existing app technology to allow the length of the Recall time to be adjustable in the field.\nOnce we validated the concept of Recall, we changed the housing to move from one centralised magnet, to multiple magnets. This greatly increased the hold and functionality of the Magnatach system. \nPrototype Footage Compilation\nPLAY\n\nRecall and Smartphone App demonstration\nPLAY\n\nMagnatach is the future of wearables\nIt was also the first time we began testing Magnatach, with great results. We could literally put the camera anywhere we wanted! We were also able to get it into the hands of users, and observe how they interacted and used it to capture their moments.\nForm development\nWe were gaining momentum, Recall and Magnatach worked, so out came the foam and a craft knife, and after a lot of coffee sessions with different user groups, we developed the design to a form that we really liked and it was time to begin sketching out what meMINI might look like.\n3D Prototyping\nAfter three rounds of basic 3D prototypes, we took the plunge and meMINI truly came to life, and the form you see today is one we are very proud of. Ben and I owe a lot to our friends, the team at Blender Design, everyone who completed one of our surveys on shape, colour or accessories and also the kindness of so many strangers, who took the time to talk to us and answer questions.\nThe people and ideas behind meMINI\nSam Lee: Co \u2013founder and Ideas\n The original founder of Snow Park in Cardrona Valley, New Zealand, Sam has always had an entrepreneurial streak. Having been at the epicenter of freestyle snow sports for over a decade, Sam has witnessed many innovations in camera technology, and been involved in the production of cutting edge skiing and snowboard films.\nWhen Sam moved on from Snow Park, he realized he had endless hours of video, but he hadn\u2019t captured the \u2018stand out\u2019 personal moments or hadn\u2019t done anything with the tapes, which had since been lost or damaged. It was out of this frustration that Sam started dreaming\u2026 What if he could create a product that would enable him to capture the moments he experienced, without creating excesses of digital content, and protect that content forever?\nHaving experience with delivering a customer-focused product with Snow Park NZ, Sam knew he needed to start engaging the wider community to help develop meMINI. Focus groups and his friends and family further validated and guided meMINI\u2019s development from concept to reality.\nBen Bodley: Co-founder and Brains\n It wasn\u2019t long before Sam came across Ben Bodley and the team at Teknique, who helped to really bring the meMINI idea to life. As well as reputable skills in product design and development, Teknique have built a reputation for manufacturing high quality, high volume camera systems for specialized filming environments, with it\u2019s camera designs having been awarded CES Honoree, and Red Dot Design awards.\nPushing the boundaries of what most think is possible, the Teknique team proved the perfect match for Sam\u2019s creativity. A family man himself, Ben could instantly see the potential in meMINI to capture his favourite moments with his family.\nInvolved throughout the development, Teknique were responsible for creating the electronics for the first ever prototype of meMINI, as well as offering the technical brains behind the smartphone and cloud-based functionality. Their involvement with meMINI will continue, as technology moves on and greater features can be added to this revolutionary product.\n2011 \u2013 CES Honoree award for HD camera & Red Dot Design Award for HD camera with Bluetooth Viewfinder\nBlender Design: Making meMINI\u2019s look\nBlender is made up of a small team of product development experts who are passionate about creating user-centered and market-oriented products. Sam approached Oliver McDermott, Managing Director, to help ensure that the design of meMINI was simple, discreet and appealing. Their design language and creative problem-solving abilities are second to none.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nmeMINI is a first of its kind. We know that there are many challenges involved, and we are excited to meet them head on, to bring meMINI to the world. We have been careful to use existing, proven electronics platforms to ensure quality, and keep the size at a reasonable level, to ensure we can meet our targets. The first challenge is gaining the backing of the kickstarter community to produce it, which is where you come in \u2013 with your help we can bring this incredible camera to life.\n\nThe process of getting meMINI from the prototype that it is now to a fully functional camera worn on your clothes involves the following:\n\nGetting the design ready for production. Luckily, we have fantastic partners in Teknique, Blender Design and experienced manufacturers who we have a long history of success with.\n\nOur talented team is fizzing with new ideas, and we are super excited to be engaging with the Kickstarter community - our end-users - to help refine this product and make meMINI the best wearable camera, period. We will be delivering new features across the entire meMINI ecosystem - camera, smartphone application, and cloud. \n\nWe are committed to building meMINI into a fun, dynamic, and sustainable company that is honoured to be responsible for capturing people's special moments - and making sure you never miss a moment again.\n\nWhats next?\n\nWe have completed the housing design, and now need to re-layout our proven electronics camera platform PCB to fit the new enclosure. Once this is done, a small initial production run will be done at our factory. Our software teams are already hard at work on the firmware, Smartphone applications, and Web backend as they are using electronics from our other cameras. This is a great position to be in as we are not hampered or slowed down in any way, and both hardware and software teams work in parallel from the beginning. \n\nAfter our prototype run has been completed, we'll run the new PCBs up and modify the software abstraction layer to support some of the new internal hardware features, and then tune the IQ (Image Quality) with our new lens. This is important to ensure the color definition meets our strict requirements. Once the design is stable, we then take the product through a larger production run and send units away for testing and certification to our lab. This is required for FCC and CE certification. As soon as our certificates are granted, we'll be able to crank the handle on volume production and quality assurance to begin shipping to you, our users! \n\nOur production timeline is targeted as follows:\n\nJan - campaign end. Design development and pre-production. \nFeb - DVT (Design Verification Test) samples ready. Testing and refinement.\nMarch - DMT (Design Maturity Test) samples ready. Testing and certification.\nApril - Volume production begins. Final quality assurance.\nJune/July - Packaging and Shipping to customers.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #48", "update_userinfo": "Camera Software Update", "update_content": "By now most of you have received your meMINI\u2019s and we hope you are enjoying capturing your favorite moments with it.

And if we reach the $200K level, we will also add an Extra HDMI input and Preset Apps to InAiR. Thanks for the continued support for this project.\nWhat is InAiR?\nInAiR brings you the world's first Augmented TV experience\nWith InAir plugged in, your TV becomes an Augmented Television. You can turn any ordinary television into a new and wonderful medium, filled with rich and dynamic information from the Web. InAiR uses your TV screen and layers in additional content from the Web and social media.\nInAir works with any standard television. And InAir works with any 3D TV.\nWhen activated in 3D mode, the layers of Internet content appear to be positioned in front of the screen and can be dynamically manipulated by the viewer. These foreground layers of information appear to be holograms, and floating \"in air\" (and this is where our name came from).\nThe following video will allow you to get a glimpse of the 3D vision of our product, where the interface and content appears in layers in front of the screen.  You can select a preferred 3D method by clicking the settings button on the lower right of the screen.  This demo can be viewed in anaglyphic mode using common red/cyan 3D glasses, or you can view in the \"side by side\" method on a 3D TV.  \nBut is is important to note that the same dynamic, layered experience can work in 2D mode on any television.  The interface and UX of inAiR were designed to simulate dimension whether that experience space is \"inside\" the TV (in 2D mode) or extended into the room (in 3D mode).   \nAre you frequently using your laptop and television at the same time? Many of us are multi-tasking: watching TV, and at the same time surfing the Web for information, purchasing things online and communicating on social networks. By designing a centralized platform, InAiR creates a single viewing experience.\nWe care a lot about quality. And we have high standards for creating a rich experience: smooth animation, layering, and clean simple graphics. Our interface is very simple to use, and is designed with gesture in mind, for touch gesture on smartphones and for hand gesture.\nWhat about the hardware?\ninAiR TV\nInAiR is a smart HDMI cable. You simply plug InAiR between your TV and your set top box. InAiR connects to your wifi, with no complicated setup process. Simply \u201cplug and play.\u201d\nWhat can InAiR do?\nInAiR intelligently identifies what you are watching on TV, automatically gathers relevant Internet and social content, and then processes and places these layers of Web information in front of your TV screen in real time, on demand. InAiR can use the vast amount of readily available free content on the Internet to enrich your viewing experience at launch. \nExamples of InAiR content\nThis example demonstrates how InAiR can take an existing mobile app (Formula 1) and ports it into your InAiR viewing space. You can watch important information such as positions of the cars, live timing, and onboard camera, inline with the main program. and you don't have to look up and and down between the TV and mobile screens.\nDocumentary\nWhile watching documentary programming, many of us like to have access to more information. This example shows the possibilities of projecting 3D models into the room to navigate and explore. It also demonstrates the way InAiR can access open web information such as Wikipedia and other relevant sites on the Internet. In this example it's the NASA website and its library of photographs.\nMovies\nIn this example, InAiR has found links to information about a movie (Skyfall), soundtracks and artists, and also special information about a Jaguar appearing as a product placement in the film. Viewers can also navigate feeds from their favorite social networks.\nSports\nIf you watch sporting events, you will be able to display relevant stats while you keep watching the game. This could be players\u2019 stats or game highlights. \nNews\nWhen watching an interesting news story on TV, have you ever wanted to check out what your favorite newspaper or blog has to say about that topic? InAiR can help you do that without having to turn on your computer. You can compare TV news with relevant articles and information right on your screen.\nOther examples:\nInformation-on-demand TV commercial\nNotifications\nHow do you navigate InAir content?\nYou can navigate InAiR content in a number of ways:\n1.  Touch gestures: simple swipes on your mobile device\nThe InAiR app will be available for free on iOS, Android and Windows, allowing you to turn your smartphone, tablet or smart watch into a remote control. The screen of your device acts like a trackpad and simple gestures will allow you to navigate the InAiR content presented in 3D or in 2D, without having to look at the mobile screen in your hand. \ninAiR trackpad control app on iOs\n2.   Hand gestures: when paired with Kinect or Leap Motion, hand gestures can be used to manipulate the content onscreen, providing a Minority Report-like experience.\nEasy set up\nInAiR also offers a wifi functionality that automatically connects to your existing wifi network. You do not need to own a \u201cSmart TV\u201d - even a traditional non-connected TV can connect to the Internet and receive additional content via InAiR\u2019s wifi capability.\nInAiR is powered via its USB connection to your set-top box, so there is no need for an extra electrical outlet nearby.\nFor developers\nA great deal of information is, of course, freely available on the open Internet for pairing with your TV viewing.\nBut also, with our API, you will be able to view additional premium content via our developer community. Our API/SDK was created to help application developers easily create content that is best suited for our InAiR interaction space. No more separate app developments for each different TV platform out there. With InAiR, you develop once and your app will work with any TV on the market.\nWhat we have achieved so far\nDevelopment timeline since we started:\ninAiR timeline\nWe started out with this:\nAnd this:\nWork-in-progress\nHardware Prototype\nThen we came to this:\nSketches of the inAiR product design\n And now we have this:\nAnd this:\ninAiR prototype\nTop view\nDetails\nWhy are we asking for your support?\nOur goal is to introduce InAiR TV to the early adopters on Kickstarter, because we believe they are the thought leaders and trend-setting community. We would like your involvement, whether to provide feedback or to create cool apps/content that will take the InAiR augmented television experience to the next level, opening a new frontier for Television.\nWe need your help to be able to build out a larger team to work on all fronts of the product, from design to engineering, from SDK to app store.\nWe also need your support to get to the next stage of manufacturing and production.\nWe are a group of very hardworking people, whose aim is to bring you a new and expanded TV experience. We will keep you updated often on our progress.\nThank you very much and we do appreciate your support!!! \nFAQs\nDo I need a special TV?\nNo. InAiR works with any existing TV, whether it is connected to the Internet or not. Our content can be displayed in 3D if your TV is 3D-capable. But use of the 3D format is entirely optional, it works just as well with regular, 2D TVs.\nHow are you serving up relevant content?\nWe have a patented InAiR content recognition engine, based on our own algorithms, which intelligently identifies relevant Internet and social content with what the viewer is watching and delivers it to the TV screen in real time. InAiR engine also allows you to search for specific terms while still watching your TV program, effortlessly through our simple track-pad app.\nCan I engage with other viewers / create a co-viewing experience?    It\u2019s up to you -- and it depends on what you are watching with whom. If you are watching a program on space exploration with your kids, you can use the InAiR interface to bring up Internet-based models of spacecraft\u2019s and planets to show them details. If you are watching a sports game with your friends in the US, you may want to stay connected with your friends in Europe (time zones permitting!) by bringing up your Twitter feed on the same screen. On the other hand, teenagers watching the evening news with mom won\u2019t want their Facebook timeline displayed on the TV screen\u2026it\u2019s your choice, you can switch InAiR on and off as you wish.\nWhat content does InAiR support?\nInAiR brings all the freely available Internet content in front of your TV screen -- including graphics, information and social engagement. For example, you can view a course map while watching a golf tournament, see actor or player profiles while watching a game or movie, and keep an eye on Twitter or Facebook, without interrupting the TV viewing experience.\nWhat TV network is compatible to inAiR?\ninAiR is compatible with ALL networks television, in ALL countries. Whether you are with Comcast, Cable Vision, Direct TV in the US or Sky, Canal + in Europe, inAir works with any TV content, live or on-demand.\nWho are your competitors? \nCurrently, there is no other product like inAiR on the market. However, we imagine that tech consumer companies like Apple, or TV manufacturers like Samsung could have R&D projects underway to develop a similar interface. They would have a definite financial advantage over our little startup, but our combination of hard-to-find talent and ability of execute nimbly and quickly gives us an edge.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have worked hard over the past year to bring you the first Augmented TV experience of its kind.

Thank you so much to all the backers, and everyone who helped spread the word! I promise to work hard, and make good use of your pledges!\nAny money raised from now will go to composing an original score, adding more detail to the scenes, and making physical prints of the film to submit to film festivals. Nothing will go to waste!\n--------------------------\n\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e | PORTFOLIO\nThree years ago, I made a pair of design-fiction short films about the future. You can watch them here:\nhttps://vimeo.com/8569187 \nhttps://vimeo.com/14294054 \nNow I\u2019m making a new film series set in Medellin, Colombia, to build on and extend those ideas. It will be an ambitious new vision of the future; instead of jetpacks, flying cars and robots, think smart cities, super-social media, and ubiquitous augmented reality. It will be a science fiction short for our time; introspective, critical, and beautifully designed.\nThe art books will be filled with production drawings like this\nWhat\u2019s it about? \nWorld-changing marvels to us, are only wallpaper to our children.\n- Bruce Sterling \nThe stories are about the realities we invent for ourselves. Each short will focus on a different character, and their perception of the city. Amongst the millions of overlapping fictions that make up augmented Medellin, we will follow: \nMarly, a local celebrity and fashion icon living through social media, who is about to face a very public betrayal. \nIn the Barrios we meet Emilio, a game-addicted labourer, breaking through the sea of profiles and statistics to find love in an unexpected place. \nDuring the final preparations for Medellin\u2019s famous Festival of Light, we will follow Juliana, a beleaguered corporate creative, who turns to God after a near death experience. \nAnd more!\nThe stories will all take place over the course of a single day, woven together with many other threads of narrative that will constantly reward the observant viewer. Themes of identity, control and delusion, will be set against a backdrop of balkanization, manipulative media channels, power struggles for data, and open-source rebellion. This is not an alien future, but rather one that is unnervingly familiar.\nThe films will be around five minutes each, and will be assembled at the end in a combined edit.\nSome designs for augmented profiles\nWhy am I doing it?\nWe shape our tools, and thereafter our tools shape us.\n- Marshall McLuhan \nTechnology is playing an increasingly important part in our everyday lives. Most of the time though, we learn about technology from the people who are trying to sell it to us. I believe that it\u2019s important to be critical; to be aware of how these technologies could shape our future. The films will expose the amazing potential, but also the possibly dark future of some technologies, while presenting them in a way that everyone can understand. \nHow does this work? \nEverything is becoming science fiction. From the margins of an almost invisible literature has sprung the intact reality of the 20th century. \n - J.G. Ballard \nOne of the prints available in the ALTERNATE REALITY package. More choices to follow!\nHave a look at our amazing rewards! As a backer, you\u2019ll be kept up to date via a project blog, and have access to lots of bonus material from behind the scenes. \nWhat\u2019s the schedule? \nThis campaign will fund the first film, which is due to start production the moment we reach our target. I\u2019m planning to release the first film in both 2D and 3D in March, and most of the rewards will be sent out around that time too. The rest of the films will follow throughout 2014. \nCan we exceed the funding goal? \nYES! Extra money will go into funding the next films in the series. More films will also mean more rewards for every backer!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\n\u00a325,000 might seem like a lot of money, but it's actually a shoestring budget considering the amount of time that will go into this project.

Somewhere down the line, I plan to raise additional funds by selling advertising space within the films.

Halloween is amazing in NYC. Come on Wednesday night, spend Thursday touring our open studios and meeting artists, and participate in the the Halloween Parade in the Village. Friday is conference day. Make a weekend of it - we may have some afterglow events or workships on Saturday, and there are cool things going on all over the city, like \"Soundings: A Contemporary Score\" at MoMA featuring Tristan Perich, a LISA2012 speaker.  You can catch \"TJ Wilcox: In the Air\" at the Whitney, \"Participatory City: 100 Urban Trends from the BMW Guggenheim Lab Exhibit\" at the Guggenheim, \"Chris Burden: Extreme Measures\" at the New Museum, or \"Balthus: Cats and Girls\u2014Paintings and Provocations\" at the Met. You could head to the museum of the moving image or the Brooklyn Museum. (Note: these museums aren't affiliated with LISA - yet!). \nFundraising Goals \nIf we raise the minimum...\nWe'll be able to bring in some artists from overseas that we think should be contributing to the conversation here. We'll pay for the basic requirements of the spaces we are using for the conference and afterparty, like insurance, equipment, rent and janitorial. We'll be able to post videos on the web of everything that takes place at the conference. We will be able to serve food our conference; we'll have printed programs; lanyard nametags, and conference t-shirts. We will compensate our team for their work producing the kickstarter video, creating the website, producing the conference and party, and working the registration tables. \n If we raise significantly more money than our minimum...\nI will be partially compensated for running LISA; we'll pay back the speakers who covered their own travel costs. If we hit the ball out of the park we'll use the money for next year so we don't have to Kickstart it again... although this is pretty fun. \nIn case we don't raise our minimum... \nWe are having this conference anyway. Maybe there will be no food or conference t-shirts, and the videos won't be as good, and the staff will not get paid, but the conference is on no matter what. Don't let that keep you from funding us though! \nWhat is Leaders in Software and Art? \n LISA was founded in the fall of 2009 by me - Isabel Walcott Draves - and my husband Scott Draves. We immediately were joined by several important co-founders and later, loyal supporters. \n We hold monthly salons in places like people's living rooms (starting to have to be a pretty big living room these days), museums, galleries, lofts, and sometimes commercial spaces. We have four presenters every month who speak about their work in software, art or both. You can see a list at the LISA website. \nCollectively, our presenters have shown work at MoMA, the Met, the Guggenheim, LACMA, SFMOMA, Cooper-Hewett, Museum of the Moving Image, the Whitney, the San Jose Museum of Art, the Museum of Contemporary Art of Barcelona, the Tate Modern, and the New Museum; they have won the Prix Ars Electronica Golden Nica and been celebrated by MediaLab Prado, Japan Media Arts, Piksel Norway, Boston Cyberarts, FILE, Siggraph, Transmediale, South by Southwest, Sonar, and ISEA; they have worked with ITP, Eyebeam, Harvestworks and the Rockefeller Foundation and are represented by Philips de Pury, Sotheby\u2019s, Sandra Gering, Bitforms, and Nancy Hoffman Gallery. They are faculty at NYU, Columbia, Pratt, RISD, and UCLA. And really - that's just the beginning.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe challenges and risks associated with running a conference are major. What if I can't get the speakers I want? What if the projection, or the audio, stops working? What if someone doesn't show up at the last minute? What if a sponsor falls through or the all over print t-shirt company goes out of business? What if there's a hurricane?\n\nI will find a workaround. That's what I do.\n\nMy goal is to satisfy the audience, no matter the obstacle. I've run events for awhile so this isn't my first endeavor. One day when I was producing the VentureBeat GamesBeat conference a number of years ago, there was a fire alarm and everyone had to clear out of the theater and the building. In a major conference every single minute is planned for, so this was a potential disaster. We asked the audience and speakers to go outside for 45 minutes and presented it with good humor as a great opportunity for extra networking. When we were allowed back in, we shortened each of the remaining sessions a bit and went a little over at the end of the day.\n\nI'll take what comes my way and, as Tim Gunn says on Project Runway, Make It Work.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #7", "update_userinfo": "Announcing CURT scholarships", "update_content": "LISA loves CURT (and boy is TED jealous)!\nThanks to the generosity of several anonymous donors, I would like to announce 10 free conference pass scholarships for qualified people from the community Currently Under-Represented in Technology (CURT).\nThis includes women, African Americans, Latinos, people over 60, the physically disabled and their companion, people from remote rural and under-funded urban locations, and others who feel this scholarship applies."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #6", "update_userinfo": "We're Funded!

With over 3200ft (1km) of usable range, a powerful ARM processor, and integrated encryption, Flutter makes it easy for you to build projects that communicate across the house, across the neighborhood, and beyond.\nWhether you want to check the temperature of a beer-brewing setup, have your mailbox send you a text message when the mailman arrives, control a swarm of flying robots, or just turn on your lights with your phone, Flutter gives you the range, power, and flexibility to do it.\nWe\u2019re not just building circuit boards though. Our goal is simple: make it easier for engineers, makers, builders, and hackers to go farther with their projects than ever before. Even if it's their first time. We\u2019re going to arrange and keep a set of basic electronics tutorials so getting started with Flutter is as easy as possible.\nGetting Connected\nCreating Flutter networks is easy, even if it\u2019s just two boards. Specify networks in Arduino code or configure Flutter with our mobile app. Once configured, devices can enter and exit the network seamlessly. This makes it extremely easy to set up a network at home (or anywhere else) where all of your projects can reliably communicate. Flutter is like a second network for your devices.\nMultiple options\nBuilding wireless projects shouldn\u2019t have to be expensive. Flutter was built from the ground up with cost in mind, that\u2019s why our boards start at just $20. We\u2019ve worked hard to keep costs as low as possible and deliver you a quality product you can afford to use in as many projects as you\u2019d like. To accomplish this, we're designing two boards:\nFlutter Basic ($20)\nStill under development, the Flutter basic is tiny and simple. You get all the features of Flutter (including 1km range) in a circuit board with an low-profile integrated antenna, rather than the large antenna shown in the video. Featuring micro USB for power and programming, components on both sides to reduce size, an LED, and a button, as well as plenty of digital and analog I/O.\nFlutter Pro ($30)\nPrototypes of this board are what is shown in our video. The Flutter Pro adds battery charging, a professional screw mount antenna, an additional button, and more memory for more code.\nOur super awesome Nintendo remote. Just 5 wires to solder. Or buy a fully finished one with our \"A Challenger Appears\" reward level!\nShields\nWe've designed a handful of shields for Flutter, focused on getting started and connecting networks. Every Flutter board that ships comes with our Breakout board and socket headers.\n\nBreakout Board\nThe Flutter Breakout board is basically a socket for your Flutter Board, letting you build projects you can easily remove Flutter from. This is great for projects you don't use all the time! Every board ordered comes with at least one of these breakouts (with sockets) so you can get going quickly!\n\nFlutter Breakout Shield on our Super Nintendo Controller mod\nRC Shield\nThe RC shield makes it easy to hook up Flutter to a standard hobby R/C car like the one shown in the video (just two plugs, no soldering). \n\nIt's not just for remote control cars though, the RC shield features a buzzer, DC jack, a few FETs for switching things on, plugs for 4 R/C servos (for use with quads), and a temperature sensor.\n\nThe FET switches on the board allow you to easily control LED lights (say, headlights and tail lights for a car), or just turn on a solenoid valve for watering the plants.\n\nOur RC shield. Two plugs to drive! Also useful for other applications\nNetwork Shield (Flutter Base Station)\nThe Network Shield connects to your home router and creates a bridge between your mobile devices, the Internet, and Flutter. The Network Shield gives you all the benefits of our mobile app but also lets you use Flutter to interact with the web: send a tweet, log sensor data to the web, or build a web page that controls your real world projects. Giving you a second network in your home with 100x the coverage of your wifi network, the Network Shield is perfect for connecting your projects to each other, your mobile devices, and the web.\nThis shield features a Texas Instruments wifi module with special SmartConfig setup that lets you connect Flutter to any 802.11b/g wifi network with just a few taps on our mobile app. And also features an ethernet jack for a simple solid connection between Flutter and the outside world.\nBluetooth Shield\nThe Bluetooth Shield connects your phone or tablet directly to nearby Flutter networks, even if you have no wifi, cellular coverage, or Internet. Perfect for times when you want to use Flutter in the wilderness and still control it with a mobile device. The Shield is available in two variants: Bluetooth 4.0 Low Energy or traditional Bluetooth 2.1. Bluetooth 4.0 Low Energy compliments Flutter\u2019s low power usage for solar and battery-powered applications, and is compatible with most newer Android devices as well as the iPhone 4s (and newer). Bluetooth 2.1 works with all Android devices and computers, but does not work with iOS. When the campaign is over you can choose which version of the shield you\u2019d prefer via an emailed survey. This way you don\u2019t have to worry about what phone you might have 6 months from now.\n\nFeatures\nRange\nOne of the most important features of any wireless system is its range and reliability. We use wifi every day, but take a few steps down the driveway and coverage quickly becomes scarce. Flutter is a different kind of wireless system, completely self-contained with over a half-mile range. This allows for a wireless platform without borders, and no longer being chained to a router means your projects are free to follow you out the front door, through the yard, and down the street.\nFlutter's range superimposed over Golden Gate park\n\nSecurity\nAs with any wireless device, security is extremely important. Since information leaving your antenna can be picked up by anyone nearby (and information coming into your antenna could have come from anywhere) it\u2019s important to have a system in place that verifies who you are talking to in a secure way that\u2019s also easy to use.\nTo make Flutter as secure as possible, we\u2019re building in special cryptographic hardware and integrating cryptography into every layer of the software, giving the user ultimate control over who can and cannot communicate with their devices.\nIntegrated Cryptography\nIn addition to software for handling encryption and decryption of data, flutter uses the cryptographic chip as the hardware element of the security system. Built specifically for use in high security applications, the Atmel ATSHA204 is based around secure storage for protecting your encryption keys.\nUsing the chip\u2019s features, Flutter networks are able to use extremely strong encryption and other cryptographic techniques to keep your network secure.\nOpen Source\nFlutter\u2019s goal will always be to provide the community with access to inexpensive and reliable wireless technology, and so Open Source was a natural marriage for our project. Every aspect of our system will be made available, from schematics, board designs, the bill of materials, right down to the firmware and mobile app. We want to make it as easy as possible for you to build or improve upon our foundation. \nMesh Networking\nFlutter\u2019s wireless technology seamlessly routes messages across multiple devices to reach their final destination. Want to send lots of data across longer distances? Drop another Flutterboard in between and let Flutter handle the rest. Got an ambitious project that requires a huge network? We\u2019ve got you covered there, too. Flutter is designed to scale from two devices to thousands, and our flexible tagging system means you won\u2019t lose track between the lights in your bedroom and the lights in the kitchen.\nVersatility & Mobile\nFlutter easily connects to other computer networks either via USB to a PC or many modern Android phones, over wifi or ethernet with our Flutter Network Shield, or over bluetooth with our Bluetooth Shield. Bluetooth is especially useful with mobile since it allows your phone to connect directly to the Flutter network without requiring Internet access or a wifi router.\nFlutter\u2019s direct USB capability and our comprehensive set of shields means that no matter what you build with Flutter it\u2019s always possible to communicate with the network using your phone.\nWe plan to develop a free, open source mobile app to provide users with an easy way to configure alerts and display project data on their phone. Use buttons and sliders to send commands to any device or browse and edit your network configuration and device tags, Flutter makes it extremely easy to manage multiple devices.\n\nPotential Applications\nYou love finding innovative ways to take on everyday tasks, whether it\u2019s dimming your lights with your smartphone, getting text notifications when the doorbell rings or the mail arrives, or even building your own quadcopter. Whatever the task at hand you can rely on Flutter to be versatile and robust enough to take on the challenge:\nFlutter displaying data with an inexpensive display\n\nLight, Water, and Temperature Sensors\nBy connecting simple sensors with Flutter you can easily collect environmental data like temperature or light, water, and humidity levels. Which means you can do anything from measuring the humidity in your greenhouse, to building a wireless beer brewing setup, monitoring the temperature in your grill, monitoring sunlight for solar applications, or even checking the Ph levels in your pool. And that\u2019s just with a couple cheap sensors.\nQuadcopters\nWith its powerful CPU and long range radio, Flutter is an excellent platform for building quadcopters. Flutter\u2019s protocol is designed just as much for reading a few sensors as it is for hardcore robotics applications so the user has ultimate control over what the protocol is doing.\nSelf-Diagnosis and Spectrum Analyzer\nFlutter can even be used to diagnose itself. Because Flutter has bare metal access to the radio hardware, you can easily listen to the radio waves around you and plot the data. We'll even build some of this functionality into the app for basic diagnosis.\nRC Cars\nHooking up Flutter to an RC car is dead simple. Whether you just want to drive it with an SNES controller for fun or use it for swarm robotics research, Flutter makes it easy.\nProject Status\nThe evolution of Flutter\n\nEverything you\u2019ve seen so far is a functional prototype; the demos in the video are 100% real and were done live, but Flutter is still under development.\nWe designed the prototypes using the Sparkfun Arduino Pro Mini board as the basis, but its limited speed and RAM mean that there\u2019s only enough room for simple programs. We want flutter to be as flexible as possible, so we\u2019re going to design new boards around the Atmel SAM3s, an affordable but powerful ARM CPU with plenty of speed and storage space for any project you can think of.\nWe\u2019re also working on evaluating a better radio, as Texas Instruments announced the code-compatible successor (TI CC1200) to our current radio chip (TI CC1101) about two months ago. We\u2019ve got samples and are already doing new board layouts, and it looks like a serious improvement across the board, with higher transmit power, better receive sensitivity, higher data rates, and better low power modes. It\u2019s the radio Flutter was always made for!\nChanging the CPU and radio (and adding the encryption chip, which our prototypes lacked), means a complete redesign of the Flutter boards, but we know it will be worth it. We\u2019ve spent months building Arduino libraries, learning about radio design, developing our business plan, and doing real world testing. We now have a comprehensive plan for developing the hardware and radio protocol that will make Flutter everything the community needs.\nEstimated Schedule\nNew prototypes based on final design: 4-6 weeks\nHardware finalization, testing, & certification: 2-4 months\nBeta SW ready; First HW shipments to early backers: 2-3 months\nWe will then work on shipping final hardware and getting the software to full release status as soon as possible.\nThis projection places initial early backer shipments at around 6 to 8 months from the campaign\u2019s end; sometime around March 2014.\nWhy We Need Kickstarter\nWe will use the funds from the Kickstarter campaign to develop the final hardware, get it FCC certified, and develop the software for the protocol, encryption, and general Arduino support. We will also develop mobile apps for Android and iOS which allow you to easily interact with Flutter projects using your phone.\nSpecifically, we need to: redesign the Flutter Pro for ARM+Encryption+New Radio, and then design the Flutter Basic to match. During this process, we will also develop the Flutter protocol beyond the libraries we have now (already 1000's of lines of our code) to include mesh support, tagging, and the associated protocol features required to support that.\nWe're building an entire ecosystem of open source software to allow everyone from app developers, to hardware hackers, web developers, and even total beginners to dive into Flutter and make the most out of it. The more funding we get the more of that we can make a reality, but at the very least we will have the hardware, protocol/software, and mobile apps for both iOS and Android. \nAbout Us\nFlutter's goal is simple: make it easier for engineers, makers, builders, and hackers to go farther with their projects than ever before. Even if it's their first time.\nWe've been hacking electronics and building our own projects our whole lives, and we've found nearly all of our projects could have benefited from wireless, but it was always too expensive. We realized that integrating wireless directly onto the main board would drastically reduce the cost, and we were able to make Flutter.\nAdd-ons a'la Carte:\nYay! We have an a\u2019la carte menu now!\nFlutter Shirt (tee or tank): $20\nFlutter Basic: $20\nFlutter Pro: $30\nShield Shield: $5\nBluetooth Shield: $35\nNetwork Shield: $55\nRC Shield: $18\nBreakout Shield: $2 Starter Kit: $30\n3D printed SNES back: $35\n1000 mAh lipo battery for SNES back: $15 \nTo add any of the above items to your pledge, simply pledge the additional amount above the reward tier you're receiving. For example, if you're pledged at the $45 level and would like to add a Flutter Pro board as well, pledge $75 ($45 + $30). When the campaign is over, we'll collect your a\u2019la carte orders via an emailed survey.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe've designed many production circuit boards, and have direct experience manufacturing circuit board runs on the order of hundreds of boards. Managing runs of thousands of circuit boards will introduce some new elements to that process, but with our team's experience and our expert advisors we're confident that we can successfully execute the manufacturing run.\n\nDesigning a radio product requires FCC certification, which can be a challenge, but initial testing of our prototype radios' performance shows efficient operation, with real world performance very closely matching the Texas Instruments' reference designs, and among our advisors is a hardcore Silicon Valley radio expert, who has spent over 35 years advancing radio technology.\n\nWe love new challenges and can't wait to work through them all - we're 100% committed to delivering a quality product and supporting it for years to come.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #60", "update_userinfo": "June 2018 Flutter Update", "update_content": "Hey there Flutter fans!\nIt's June and you're all due for an update on Flutter's goings ons.\nFirst, a TL;DR:\nI was having some trouble getting a good sales rep at Seeed Studio, but I think that's sorted.

I know we're talking about a meaningful amount of money for folks and its painful to be out of pocket but as with all investing you really should not be backing projects if the loss of your investment will be a material impact to you.

Our design builds on four principles: (1) Spiri as a platform for creation and development, (2) Spiri as a well-balanced and sensitive physical machine, (3) Spiri as an autonomous and social creature, and (4) Spiri as a way to bring people together. \nOur intent is to help you evolve Spiri based on your own passions, objectives, and imagination. Spiri can be a courier, a rescuer, a spelunker, a cartographer, a playmate, a gardener, an inspector, a reporter, a teammate, a wanderer, anything.\n1. Create and Develop\nSpiri is set up to free developers and users from the need to control and correct flight, so that you can get on with programming what you really want Spiri to do. Our API and library of flight primitives and other basic commands allow developers to work on top of the main chip, which runs Ubuntu Linux with ROS (Robot Operating System). This is an open source platform supported by an active community of hobbyists, engineers and scientists. We are designing a simple script-calling environment for end use, as well as a native programming environment for app development. The Spiri Applications Platform, also under development, will give developers a way to get their apps out to the wider Spiri user base.\n2. Tough yet Sensitive\nDurability is a challenge for all quadrotors, but we are making it a priority. We have worked with all sorts of materials and geometries to construct a strong-but-light protective ribbon to encase our rotors. After testing, we decided to use reinforced carbon fiber. Nothing is indestructible, but this ribbon can take a lot of punishment. Your first crash won\u2019t be the end of Spiri play time.\nCarbon fiber ribbon before sanding and painting\nWe designed Spiri to fall flat, and reinforced the bottom of the enclosure to protect its electronics. That being said, the parts that stand to face the most damage in a crash, such as the battery pack and the motor mounts, are easy to service and inexpensive to replace. Parts and instructions will be available through our website.\nSpiri carries a lot of sensors. In addition to the usual array of accelerometers, gyroscope and magnetometer, Spiri has GPS, a downward-facing acoustic sensor, a downward-facing camera, a forward-facing camera and a forward-facing range finder. On top of Spiri is a USB connection for additional sensors or peripherals you may want to add. For the hardware makers out there, we will have a hardware API as well.\n3. Autonomous and Social\nBecause Spiri is autonomous, you can let it fly without a remote control. Whatever program it is running will track its location, keep it aloft, bring it to specified points of interest, cause it to engage with its surroundings, and bring it back to you safely. When it is running low on battery life, it will return and land on its inductive perch to recharge. It can go out of wifi range, even out of sight, and return safely to you. That means that in some sketchy situations, Spiri will be able to take care of itself. Moreover, free from manning Spiri\u2019s controls, you will be able to launch two at once\u2014or five hundred. We are very excited about what people will do with a flock of Spiris. Imagine the possibilities for video mapping, search, or winning a game of capture the flag!\n4. Community\nOur vision of personalized robotics as a friendly and accessible phenomenon is what motivates us. Let's deliver on that long unfulfilled technological promise we\u2019ve all seen expressed in more than a century of science fiction: the promise of a robot companion. We want developers to have an audience in the rest of the user base\u2014we want to make it as easy as possible for you to share. Our choice of Ubuntu Linux with ROS is meant to place Spiri within an already active development context.\nSome other ways we see a user community forming are through games, projects, performances and organized events. We also expect that people will share, Spiri-to-Spiri and via cloud support, in urban mapping, educational collaborations, learned flight optimization and more. There are so many possibilities. We don't pretend to know them all. We will continue to be in touch as you, the community, grow and evolve. We\u2019re excited to see what you want to do\u2014so tell us what you need.\nWhere We Are Now\nThe Aviary\nTest flight setup at The Aviary\nWorkstations at The Lab\nCurrently we are designing, tesing, fabricating and flying Spiri in The Lab, our development space and The Aviary, our flight testing location. \nIn the past 13 months we have:\nTested and selected sensors, chips, and other electronics\nTested and selected motors, rotors, and other hardware\nDesigned circuit boards, system architecture, and internal communications systems\nDesigned and tested battery pack\nDesigned protective ribbon, primary casing, and battery pack casing\nAdded acoustic sensor, two cameras, and range-finding camera \nTested materials and fabrication processes for protective ribbon and casings\nCreated theoretical framework for primary flight control\nImplemented a simple closed control loop for hovering mode \nSet up a new 2,500 sq ft lab (the Aviary) to house a large flight testing arena\nDeveloped the API and multi-language wrapper framework \nDesigned a 10,000 sq ft assembly plant and manufacturing processes \nSelected and tentatively reserved a location for the assembly plant \nProduction Plan\nIn the upcoming months our major goals are:\nAugust\nExtend API \nRefine closed control loop to include physical modelling and camera data \nSeptember \n\nOrder parts and complete plan to phase in assembly (after close of Kickstarter) \nDevelop and test additional flight maneuver primitives \nRelease API and development tools to selected researchers and backers \nSend research-only Spiri models to selected researchers and backers (If you are a researcher please contact us at info@pleiades.ca to see if you qualify for a research model)\nOctober \nSet up the assembly plant and work stations\nIncrease parts inventory, begin light assembly, finalize assembly processes\nDevelop and test additional flight maneuver primitives \nNovember\nRamp up Spiri production\nDevelop and test additional flight maneuver primitives \nDecember\nContinue Spiri production \nDevelop and test additional flight maneuver primitives\nJanuary \nAll Early Release Spiris shipped \nSpiri Development Platform beta release \nContinue Spiri production \nBug fixes and feature enhancements to development tools  \nSpiri Applications Platform beta release \nDevelop and test additional flight maneuver primitives \nFebruary \nContinue shipping Spiris to backers on first in first out basis \nContinue Spiri production\nBug fixes and feature enhancements \nDevelop and test additional flight maneuver primitives \nMarch \nFull Spiri software version 1.0 \nSpiri development platform 1.0 \nFlight primitive library 1.0 \nContinue shipping Spiris to backers on first in first out basis \nContinue Spiri production \nBug fixes and feature enhancements \nDevelop and test additional flight maneuver primitives \nApril \nFull public launch \nAll Spiri shipped \nSpiri Applications Platform released \nRewards \nSpiri Poster by Gillian Goerz\nWe have some great rewards for you (check out the right hand column!) and some really exciting stretch goals planned. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nSupplier Risks\nThis is a risk in any hardware project. We will use trusted component suppliers with whom we have established relationships and who have already delivered quality products to us on time. We will assemble Spiri in North America, at a facility located just a two hours\u2019 drive from our Aviary in Halifax, Nova Scotia. This helps mitigate production risks, but also supplier risks in allowing us to reduce customs and shipping risks related to supplies.\n \nHardware Development Risks\nWe\u2019ve spent the past 13 months systematically eliminating hardware risks and progressing through successive versions of the circuitry, sensors, motors, casing, ribbon, and other components, all well in advance of bringing this project to Kickstarter. Our lab models now are several steps past first prototype, and we are confident in being able to make Spiri\u2019s hardware, as it is now, robust on a commercial scale.\n \nSoftware Development Risks\nOur Company has been a software developer for over a decade, and we understand all too well the risks and challenges of delivering quality applications on time and on budget. We will be sending early research-only models of Spiris to various research labs and hacker/programmer groups in late 2013 so that they are tested in a variety of contexts, and to verify the repeatability of our work. This will also inform our work on the Developer Kit and Spiri Applications Platform. Since our focus is on the programmability and versatility of Spiri, rather than on software features, we can be confident in meeting our primary objective of Spiri being ready for you to program when it ships. \n\nProduction Risks\nYes, we really are manufacturing Spiri in Canada. After analyzing costs and production risks we decided, given the size of our release batches and the complexities and risks inherent in outsourcing, that overseeing our own assembly and Q&A is the best choice for us. We are bringing an experienced production team on board to run the assembly facility, and it will be a short drive for anyone in our Halifax-based research team.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #75", "update_userinfo": "Reboot", "update_content": "A few of you have sent messages looking for a sign of life.

It's the simplest, most versatile, least expensive LED Matrix Display system that exists today, with useful features for all experience levels with electronics.  And the software & hardware will be Open Sourced upon successful funding!\nYou can stack or arrange up to 64 Displayboards together in a single system in any way that you like. Each Displayboard is 1.5 x 2 inches, 5x7 LEDs, and Two Color (can be combined for 3 colors!). *Final Production Boards will have ceramic oscillators for the ATmegas.\nHere's a demonstration of how to display animations on an LEDgoes:\nWe have been working on this project for over a year and are finally ready to push for the final design while preparing the funding to manufacture & sell it. Our Kickstarter seeks to prove that there are people turned off by the cost, complexity, lack of features, and lack of expandability of present-day products -- and that LEDgoes is the answer. We won't exist unless you want us to. (And we appreciate your resounding support & vote of confidence!)\nAll of the commercial systems we saw on the market are locked into proprietary interfaces and/or have only one color, aren't replaceable nor expandable, have limited means to communicate with or program, and are expensive! The DIY area was not much better as existing systems either cost $45 a character (over twice the retail price we are asking), had a learning curve, are limited to one color, aren't modular, and all of them required expensive external controllers you had to program to get going.\nGen 2 boards\nIt all started when we went to a local electronics shop and saw these cheap LED Matrix boards. Stevo had always wanted to have a Stock Ticker in his office, but the commercial systems just would not do what he needed. We were inspired. T3am Aw3s0m3 was on the job.\nWe designed this system for everyone from the Grandma who has trouble hearing her phone and would benefit from having caller ID displayed above the TV or in the Bedroom to the tinkerer who wants to make it drive a giant array of motors!   \nDisplayboards with 3D printed prototype Modular cases\nLEDgoes are also commercial use friendly.  No longer does a store owner need to throw away a $300-500 LED display because one of the LEDs burnt out or a chip died. Here you simply replace the board if the chip dies and the LED Matrix if an LED goes bad. \nLEDgoes uses easy to find, inexpensive parts. You will be able to find LED Matrix' that are compatible for a very long time. You will also be able to make new boards yourself and the chip pinout covers a whole line of very popular microcontrollers : the ATMEGA.\nBoard Space\nYou can design and connect LEDgoes any way you like. Wrap them around a corner, backpack, back windshield, DJ booth, bar, store, on top of a door, frame, or use your imagination! You can even string together Displayboards vertically to make an LED matrix of ANY SIZE!\nThe LEDgoes protocol allows you to do Images, Text, Scrolling, and even ANIMATIONS! You can design your own Fonts, Characters, Sprites, whatever! *Imagine Mario on this or LED Pacman!*\nIt's TOTALLY HACKABLE. LEDgoes Displayboards use the Arduino Bootloader which can be reprogrammed through the same connection interface used to connect the Displayboards together. That means that each Displayboard has 26 GPIO Hackable pins in a ~1.5x2inch board with two chips for less than $20. That is an unheard-of price and size in the DIY Market.\nEdge Connector\nWe already have apps and code for every level of user. Our code can shout out Twitter #hashtags, display RSS Feeds, runn the matrix from independent Arduino & Netduino code, and we've got some simple standalone apps for typing out messages in different colors and scroll speeds to the board over USB on Windows, MAC, and Linux. The Android application is already underway. iOS will be available too!\nWhy do you need the Money? Looks like you have a lot of it done. We need the money to fund the first official production run of the LEDgoes Displayboards and to finalize design and build all of the partner boards of the system. We also cannot go to market if the market doesn't exist. It is one thing to do it for yourself and another to do it for the world. \nBack - Smooth and No Parts makes for Easy Mounting (Adding Screw holes for Wall Mount)\n*These LED Matrices and all boards are designed for Indoor use. The displays are not bright enough to be read easily outdoors in full sunlight and they are not built for being outside.\nT-SHIRT DESIGN\nEach T-shirt is a Soft Cotton (Nice shirts you will wear) and come with 3 Washable markers. It is a White silkscreen on a Black shirt and has a picture of a 30x7 inch matrix (equal to 6 LEDgoes) for you to customize, rinse, and customize again! \nLEDgoes Modular cases - 3D printed prototypes.\nFuture Work Outside of the initial push: We are also working with some outside friends to manufacture a Modular Case system for LEDgoes which will allow each board to attach to its own case and the cases lock together for a sturdy, one-piece design.\nEnd Caps will also be made for all of the Accessory Boards. ALL CAD DESIGNS WILL BE OPENSOURCE and printable on a 3D printer. Molds for doing injection Molded cases will come much later as the turn around on molds can be as much as 3 months.\nLEDgoes Displayboard in the Modular Case prototype.\nPowered by ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRISKS: \n- Parts and Designing (like any project)\n- Production/Part issues (like any hardware project)\n\nCHALLENGES: \n- Getting everything done in time\n- Building and shipping Locally in TEXAS\n\nWe have a Unique situation. \n\nAll production, design, shipping, etc is done in Texas by a group of friends. \n\nOne friend owns a Fulfillment Company in Dallas. \nOne friend owns a DIY Online Store.\nOne friend owns an Electronics Production Company.\n\nWe met at the Dallas Makerspace 2 years ago.

We're tackling these questions by traveling the US, talking to prison guards, former inmates, people who are currently incarcerated, judges, husbands and wives. \nBy the end of the year, we\u2019ll produce a feature-length radio documentary that puts all the pieces of the puzzle in one place to tell this chapter of the American story.\nIt will air on public radio stations nationwide, be available online, and play at public listening events inside school classrooms, community halls, and prison libraries.\nWho we are and why we need you\nWe live and work in northern New York, one of the landscapes changed forever by America's prison-building boom.

Seekers Unlimited may be the only company in America designing larps specifically to meet scholastic standards in math, science, social studies, language arts, etc.\nEdu-larps benefit students by: \nEnabling students to experience subjects contextually instead of just reading about them abstractly.\n\nFostering collaborative problem solving. \n\nMaking the learning experience enjoyable, thus increasing knowledge retention and transferability.\n\nEmpowering students to make their own role-playing choices and experience consequences without personal failure\u2014character actions are not part of grading, player learning is. \n\nGetting kids up and out of their chairs, moving around and interacting with other people--learning by doing.  \nWHAT IS AN EDU-LARP?\nCheck out this video from Tedd Wakeman, talking about the Ancient Mesopotamia edu-larp designed by Seekers Unlimited (available for free). \nAn edu-larp is an educational game of play pretend. Students (and teachers) pretend to be someone else for the duration of the class, learning by walking in that person\u2019s shoes. Through research and a hands-on approach, they get a full experience of learning beyond just reading a book or hearing a lecture. What\u2019s more fun: reading about Benjamin Franklin, or BEING Benjamin Franklin for a day? \nEDU-LARPS ARE NOT VIDEO GAMES \nSeekers Unlimited believes that although there are amazing technological advances, not all schools or all students have access to the latest computers and upgrades, and it might be years before they do. Our games just require imagination.\nWith edu-larps, the teacher retains the ability to throttle the material to an easier or more difficult level and to differentiate each part to their specific class. Edu-larp is a pedagogy flexible enough to challenge without being overwhelming, supportive without coddling. They are limited only by human creativity, not by file size, bandwidth, or pre-programmed choices. Educational live action role playing engages students to teach themselves and each other, learn from and even teach the instructor, all while actively interacting with human beings instead of passively trying to absorb material from workbooks, packets, or lecture videos. \nWHO WE ARE\nAaron Vanek - Executive Director, Founder, Designer, has been larping for nearly 25 years, with numerous credits. He has written for many larp publications and co-edited a few. His essay Cooler Than You Think: Understanding Live Action Role Playing is used as a required text for the University of Washington course Heroes and Monsters. He has designed and produced larp events for the Girl Scouts of America, the West Hollywood Book Fair, and the Paul Biane Library in Rancho Cucamonga (which received the 2013 National Medal for Museum and Library Service, partly due to their edu-larps designed by Vanek and others) before starting Seekers Unlimited. He is a strong advocate for the power of live action role playing and is frequently interviewed as a larp expert in the popular press. \nChristian Brown - Designer, has been larping for twenty years. Since 2011, Christian has become a full-time larp professional, making a living by supplying interactive experiences to a core group of fans. Brown jumped at the opportunity to join Seekers Unlimited. He now contributes his gaming expertise to the educational and executive background of the board. He designs rule-sets, writes stories, and creates in-class role-playing experiences for students. The most common reaction Brown gets from friends and acquaintances when he tells them about Seekers Unlimited is, \u201cI wish we had that when I was a kid.\u201d He couldn\u2019t agree more.\nWhitney \"Strix\" Beltran - Fundraising Coordinator, is a Ph.D. student at Pacifica Graduate Institute\u2019s Mythological Studies program and a scholar who regularly straddles the interdisciplinary space between mythological and role-playing studies. She has shown a lifelong commitment to education and public service and has served as both a grant writer and funding coordinator for non-profits associated with the Arts in schools, environmental education, nutrition for children, and sustainable food projects. Strix has also served in the United States Peace Corps. Her passion for edu-larp began when her own light bulb went off while participating in Model United Nations in high school. Her aim is to ensure that Seekers Unlimited can bring that light bulb moment to as many students as possible, making learning both a powerful and relevant experience that will help students succeed in life.\nFull bios of our staff, board of directors, and advisory council can be found on our website. \nDESCRIPTION OF REWARDS \nPlease note that the prices for our edu-larps and design services are for our Kickstarter donors only. \nAny level that has the term \"artifact\" in it means you get a physical object mailed to you in addition to an electronic version, if applicable.\nTHANKS! - We will list your name on our website as a donor if you choose. \nBASIC ARTIFACT LEVEL - You will receive a Seekers Unlimited-branded pen with an LED light in orange and black:\nMock up of the LED light pen (logo will be smaller)\nLARPER LEVELS - You will receive your choice of a larp written by either Aaron Vanek or Seekers board member and veteran larper Michael Tice. Neither was made to meet any specific scholastic standards nor do they have student assessments, but they are both entry-level live action role playing events.\nThe Basic Larper Level includes your choice of one of these, the Advanced Larper Level includes both. If you choose the Artifact reward level you get a signed, numbered, softcover copy as well as the electronic version(s).\nSecret Ante - Aaron Vanek\u2019s entry for the 2013 Larpwriter challenge. Secret Ante investigates what it means to be a character and a person through a modified version of poker. It can be used as an introduction to the character-making aspect of larping, a stand alone scenario, or an exercise that is part of a larger larp. For 5-20 adults, about 2-3 hours.\nExodus 22:18 = A finalist in the 2013 Larpwriter Challenge, sponsored by the cutting edge Nordic Larp convention Knutepunkt. This is an introductory larp scenario by Mike Tice for 12-15 players, 3-4 hours.\nIn this larp, players portray inhabitants of a European town during the height of the witch trials in the 15th century. The local priest, Father Aldo, unexpectedly died a week ago. Shortly before his death, Father Aldo composed a letter to the Inquisitor in a nearby city, indicating that his illness was due to witchcraft, and that one or more witches lived in his town in the guise of honest Christian folk.\nThe Inquisitor has now arrived in the town, and has summoned a number of prominent citizens who had contact with the priest on the last day of his life to the town hall in order to carry out a preliminary investigation. The Townsfolk are set the task of uncovering any witches among them.\nTHE EDU-LARPS FOR MIDDLE GRADE SCIENCE\nSeekers Unlimited ran these six edu-larps at a charter school in Los Angeles for an 8th grade science class. You can receive one, two, three, four, five, or all six of them as donor rewards. You choose the one(s) you want based on your donation level. Some have additional costs for materials that are listed next to the description (materials not provided). \nThese edu-larps are designed to last for 4-8 hours spread over a few class days, but teachers can adjust this based on the experience.\nAlthough designed for middle school science standards, they include lessons in math, social studies, writing, research, and more. \nThese edu-larps are appropriate for ages 10-14, but with some adjustments can be enjoyed by students a few years younger or older. \nThey do not have to be used in a classroom setting, but they were designed for that setting and include assessments built into the games. If we reach our fundraising goal, these goals and assessments will be matched to the Common Core State Standards; they currently meet California Science Standards (8th grade). \nAll edu-larp rewards include a lifetime technical support license to access any updates or changes we make to the scenario, as well as support for you in case you have questions or need specific changes--perhaps you need a few more characters for a larger class. We will send you new PDFs with changes, but not any print (artifact) copies. \nDescriptions of the six games\nBalloon Race - Students learn about forces and gravity by racing balloons across the classroom. Material cost = ~$50\nBe Your Own Planet! - Students create and name their own stars, planets, and other stellar bodies in a fun game that teaches forces, gravity, mass, density, and concepts about our own solar system. Can their star systems survive interstellar dangers? Material cost = ~$5\nMonster Maker - Students role-play Dr. Frankenstein by creating their own clay creatures that duel one another by asking science questions developed by the students and approved by the teacher. This edu-larp introduces students to the basic concepts of chemistry in living systems. Material cost = ~$30\nElement Hero \u2013 With super powers based on the elements, students must stop villains attacking their city. An adventure that introduces students to the atom and the periodic table. Material cost = nothing \nA student looking over the autopsy report for \"Noir\"\nNoir - Can you solve a mysterious death? Students role-play detectives, forensic scientists, and suspects in a series of possible crimes. Using science and the scientific method, they gather evidence and form a hypothesis about the death. On the final day a trial is held to determine the outcome of each case. Material cost = ~$10 \nThe Great Phlogiston Debate - Students role-play actual scientists active at the end of the Age of the Enlightenment. One of the biggest scientific principles under scrutiny at that time was the theory of \u201cphlogiston,\u201d a substance that supposedly existed in elements that burned and was released when set afire. Material cost = ~$30 \nSee the video below of actual gameplay of the edu-larps Noir, Monster Maker, and The Great Phlogiston Debate (apologies for picture and audio quality)\nOUR CUSTOM DESIGN SERVICE REWARD LEVELS \nThese top level rewards enable us to design an educational larp for YOU or your organization on a topic, subject, or lesson of your choice, from kindergarten to adult education. We are also offering a how-to workshop so your staff can run and even make their own educational larps. \nThese reward levels include our travel arrangements and some materials, but do NOT include site rental or marketing expenses--you must provide the space and the people.\nStretch goals\n$10,000 - Hit Seekers (stretch goal #1) \u2013 If we make this amount, we will be able to release Hit Seekers as a bonus edu-larp. This will be available in addition to the edu-larps listed above, both print and PDF. \nDesigned for remedial high school math, students take on the roles of music company executives trying to make money by signing fictional artists and producers and getting them into the recording studio to make an album. It was made to run for at least two weeks, but can be extended for an entire semester as an additional pervasive activity. \n$12,500 - Language Seekers (stretch goal #2) - If we raise this amount, we will design a booklet of short scenarios for language teachers. These scenarios will ask students to role-play simple scenes in the chosen language. Teachers can adjust the level of difficulty, the vocabulary and grammar used, as well as play a character that interacts with students. If we make this amount in donations, Language Seekers will be playtested in a high school French class taught by Aaron Vanek's sister-in-law, who requested it (fall-winter 2013-14).\n$15,000 - Stretch goal #3 - A secret! (for now) \nWHY KICKSTARTER? \nThe schools we are working with have had their budgets slashed, so we don't charge them a dime to develop and test our programs. We incur the materials costs for each game.\nAlso, raising funds to produce these educational games is extremely difficult, especially without our tax-exempt status. It could take years to receive grant funding even after we receive a 501c3 designation, which may take months--this IRS department is currently under tremendous pressure and scandal. Besides the design costs, we have the expected expenses of a startup company: insurance, legal fees, website creation, etc. \nAll the educational larps above have been classroom-tested, and with your help we can offer them to schools nationally and continue our development of more inspiring scenarios.\nWhenever we receive 501c3 tax-exempt status, a portion of your donation may be eligible to be deducted as a charity donation.  \nThe joy of edu-larp", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe design team of Seekers Unlimited has been creating larps for more than 20 years. Previous clients for our educational larps include the Girl Scouts of America, the West Hollywood Book Fair, the Paul Biane Library, UCLA Game Lab, GameDesk, Our Community Charter School, the APEX Academy, and New Heights Charter School. \n\nWe have observed each playtest of the edu-larps we are offering and will adjust each game based on those observations as well as provide examples and guidelines for teachers unfamiliar with role-playing. We are constantly consulting with educators around the world to create the most effective, engaging experience we can. We have run two successful, smaller Kickstarter campaigns before: Star Seekers and Hit Seekers. \n\nAs a nascent public charity corporation, we are committed to providing the best tools for learning at an affordable price. If we do not make our goals, there will be a significant delay in bringing our games to market as we wait for our 501c3, then wait for grants and further fundraising fruition. It will be much harder to create additional edu-larps for other classrooms. It won\u2019t stop us, but it will slow us down. We believe students have been waiting long enough for an exciting, captivating education.\n\nIf we do meet our goals, we will: align our edu-larps to Common Core Standards; create art for each game; lay out the materials; and add playtest notes and options for expansion and pacing--all in a teacher-friendly format. We have a wealth of experience with a talented team in all of these areas who will aid us in efficient completion. Production delays are possible, but since all the edu-larps are already in a basic prototype format--detailed enough to run in a school--we're confident that our products will reach our donors hands within a year or less.

It's not what I wanted (the board vote was 4 for dissolution, 2 against, me being on of the against votes), but this story has a happy ending.\n\nI joined the board of directors of The Game Academy in 2016, another 501c3 non-profit dedicated to using role-playing games and larps for education via afterschool enrichment and summer camps. I rolled over my experience from Seekers to TGA, and we've been growing at a phenomenal pace! In two years we went from one site to four, and in a few months we're likely to expand to seven! This is in the San Francisco Bay Area, and we hope to open our first summer camp in Los Angeles in the summer of 2019.\n\nFurthermore, we just received our first grant--$10,000 from the Benjosh Foundation! It has long been a dream of mine to get a grant to create educational larps, and now it has finally happened!\n\nAnd there's more good news related to this Kickstarter campaign:\n\nThe purpose of the campaign, to publish the educational larps that I designed (with one by Christian Brown), is slowly moving closer to reality. Since August I have been teaching science through these larps at the , being a second playtest. I have learned so much more through direct classroom instruction (mostly middle school) for the last three years that the revision process on the edu-larps will be easier and vastly improve the final results.\n\nDespite setbacks, I am still pushing forward with bringing live action role playing to education, and with this new company, we are making definitive progress.\n\nIf you want to help The Game Academy, we are trying to raise $30,000 by the end of the year. Even a $1 donation helps, and you will get updates on bringing this pedagogy to the world through this vibrant company. I am so happy to be a part of an active board that's making a real difference in kids' lives.\n\n\n\nAnd for more information on The Game Academy,"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #22", "update_userinfo": "Update on edu-larps (formerly Seekers Unlimited)", "update_content": "Despite the dissolution of Seekers Unlimited as a company and your generous Kickstarter donation being transferred to the Institute of Play as part of the Seekers breakup, I still intend to complete and release the edu-larps for which this Kickstarter campaign was launched.\n\nTo that end, I have recently run \"Be Your Own Star System\", the first in the edu-larp line, for a 7th and 8th grade science class at the private school where I now teach Analog Game Design (and Robotics), with the approval of our science teacher. I believe that this edu-larp is 85% complete, and after a revision it will go into layout, and from there to other teachers to test in their classrooms before finalizing it.\n\nHowever, this might not occur before this school year ends (June for most schools). My hope is that this educational larp is released in late 2017 or early 2018. Furthermore, has agreed to distributing this and the other edu-larps.\n\nWhen this happens, I will make sure that all backers of this campaign are able to receive a digital copy; those who donated for the a print version will get that.\n\nThere should be only nine donors who have not received their rewards for this campaign: four for name recognition in a larp, two to get BYOSS, two to get Monster Maker, and one for a specially-designed game. If you want to download the alpha versions of these games, they are available (for free) . Again, despite the absence of Seekers Unlimited, I still intend to fulfill the rewards of this campaign.\n\nTo that end, last summer I joined the board of another educational game-based 501c3 non-profit, , which has been very active: we are currently running an afterschool RPG program plus a \"larping to learn life skills\" curriculum for high school Spanish language students, and we are gearing up for another season of RPG summer camps.

Click here to view in Sketchfab. \nSTRETCH GOALS \n1) Help us reach $250,000 and we will include tripod mounting capability to Fuel 3D along with PC remote triggering with all Fuel3D units. ACHIEVED !!\n2) Help us reach 350 units of the Fuel3D and MeshUp bundle and we will add painless automated merging of multiple scans to create single unified model. UPDATE: We are now aiming to develop this software feature in time for the product launch, regardless of whether we meet the stretch goal or not. Read our latest update on this.\nWhile this can be done now by manually using MeshUp or other tools, depending on the scan and desired results, it can require some time and effort. Hitting this goal will allow us to promise the delivery of a 'state of the art' automated registration and stitching workflow seamlessly integrated into MeshUp.\nThe Fuel3D handheld scanner\n3D is booming\u2026 whether in the worlds of gaming, making, or art, the demand for 3D is ever-increasing. But generating high quality 3D images for use in 3D printing or gaming is typically time-consuming and expensive. A handheld 3D scanner today can cost upwards of $15,000, pricing them well above what most independent game developers, designers and artists can afford.\nThat\u2019s why we\u2019re here on Kickstarter.\nWe have developed the Fuel3D handheld scanner, a point-and-shoot 3D imaging system that captures extremely high resolution mesh and color information of objects. Fuel3D is the world\u2019s first 3D scanner to combine pre-calibrated stereo cameras with photometric imaging to capture and process files in seconds. \nAnd, most importantly of all, at a Kickstarter price for under $1000 the Fuel3D costs less than one tenth of the price of its nearest industry competitor.\nThe Fuel3D scanner works in much the same way as a normal digital camera \u2013 literally point and shoot! But it shouldn\u2019t be confused with the consumer 3D cameras available today.\nThe Fuel3D camera is significantly more advanced.\n3D scan images taken with our Fuel3D functional prototype\nWhen we say 3D, we mean our system resolves a fully 3D surface consisting of a large number of physical and color measurements. These can then be viewed from any direction, edited, and used as source material for 3D printing or for on-screen manipulation.\nCheck out the portfolio page on our website \u2013 you can download actual scan files in .STL .OBJ and .PLY formats. Go play \u2013 we think you\u2019ll like it!\nSo what can I use Fuel3D for?\nFuel3D can be used by anyone who wants the ability to rapidly create 3D models. Whether you are part of the maker movement, involved in mass personalization, a game developer, animator, 3D artist or any other type of creative developer who uses 3D, Fuel3D is a tool for you.\nFuel3D particularly excels in the capture of objects and surfaces including:\nSkin e.g. faces and body parts\nFabrics\nOrganic subjects e.g. plants, leaves\nStone, masonry, brick, wood\nFood\nArtwork, e.g. textured paintings, statues\nThe following 3D scans were taken with our current functional prototype. In the final product that will be available through Kickstarter, the core technical components will remain the same so the data quality will be identical.\n3D scan images taken with our Fuel3D functional prototype\nHow we got here\nThe Fuel3D technology was originally developed at Oxford University for use in a 3D medical imaging system that has now been successfully used in hospitals across the world. Fuel3D Inc. has now been established to further develop this underlying 3D imaging technology into the world's first truly affordable high resolution handheld colour 3D scanner. Here's how we got here:\nFeb 2005 \u2013 Prof Ron Daniel Lecturer in Engineering Science at Oxford University and James Patterson (finishing his PhD) agree to collaborate and file their first patent\nAug 2006 \u2013 Ron and Jamie\u2019s new venture is spun out of Oxford University \nSep 2007 \u2013 Decided to focus on medical applications (wound care) and developed first device using off-the shelf cameras and flashes stuck together with duct tape!\nOct 2009 \u2013 First functional Alpha prototype leads to NHS and VC funding, company expansion\nJuly 2011 \u2013 Pre-production Beta camera released to clinical collaborators \n2012/13 \u2013 Medical product now in use in 25 UK national health clinics, with other deployments in the US, France, Denmark, Australia and Afghanistan \nJanuary 2013 \u2013 The lack of affordable, quality 3D scanning options for the burgeoning 3D market leads Stephen Crossland, to recommend a low cost general purpose 3D scanner based on proven medical technology\nMarch 2013 \u2013 Fuel3D, the handheld scanner for under $1000 is conceived\nJune 2013 \u2013 Fuel3D Inc. is established to develop Fuel3D handheld scanner for non-medical market\nAug 2013 \u2013 Fuel3D working functional prototype launched on Kickstarter \n(Future) May 2014 \u2013 First Fuel3D devices delivered to early bird Kickstarter pledgers\nThe above sequence shows a selection of prototypes and concepts that have led to the Fuel3D scanner. The black model (lower centre position) is our functional prototype.\nWhat we\u2019re going to do\nWe have already developed a fully working prototype scanner, with your assistance we can perform the final engineering work to lower the component costs to enable us to offer Fuel3D from under $1000 here on Kickstarter, plus further develop our software to make access to our high quality 3D data as easy as possible. By reaching our goal here on Kickstarter, we can do this. \nWe believe we are offering an incredible price for a 3D scanner, particularly one that comes with the flexibility and ease of use of being handheld and can also generate high-resolution, high-quality, full color true 3D geometry. \nInternal view of functional prototype\nKey components of Fuel3D (left to right): main PCB, flash reflector module, stereo optics assembly\nProduct design\nThe product shown in our video is the working functional prototype we have today. The final product will be quite different in design and smaller in size. We\u2019ve also included some product design graphics to show you where we\u2019re going with the final product.\nTechnical stuff\nWhen you take a picture on a conventional 3D mobile phone or digital camera you are using a technique known as stereoscopic imaging. This uses two camera viewpoints, one for each eye, to display a \u201c3D\u201d image on a stereoscopic screen that gives the impression of depth.\nIn contrast, the core technology behind Fuel3D fuses geometric and photometric stereo 3D recovery techniques and is finely tuned to capture high resolution 3D color images. This raw capability provides the opportunity for an object to be captured in true 3D geometry and full color. The technology is also inherently good at capturing other highly textured surfaces, both organic and inorganic.\nOnce a shot has been taken on the Fuel3D scanner the raw image data is converted into true 3D color geometrical data by our own software, which is included with the Fuel3D scanner. To run the Fuel3D software, you will need a reasonable specification computer (Mac, Windows 7 or higher, 2GB RAM, dual-core processor).\nOur software generates a 3D color data file and allows some basic editing functionality prior to export:\nTrimming of unnecessary areas \nAdjusting the resolution for export, in turn reducing the polygon number for easier handling\nExporting in commonly used 3D file formats, including .OBJ .STL and .PLY with color\nOutput resolution from Fuel3D varies with the distance of the system to the subject. The best achievable resolution is approximately a 250 micron sampling. To provide an indication of data accuracy, an object known to be flat (-/+ 0.25mm) was imaged several times at the minimum achievable resolution (i.e. the greatest distance from the Fuel3D scanner). A synthetic plane was then fitted to the data and error bounds calculated as distances from the plane. Results were as follows:\nFor further product specifications and other technical information please click here to download our technical overview. \nA full 3D solution\nAt Fuel3D we are focusing on providing the best possible data quality achieved at the most accessible price. Depending on what you want to do in the 3D world you will probably need some other technology to form your full solution. Here are a couple of suggestions from us:\nSoftware - Many third party software packages are available for further 3D data processing beyond the basic tools you get with Fuel3D. We have seen some really exciting things done with 3D scan data in MeshUp software from Uformia, another Kickstarter success story, so we have buddied-up with them to offer a limited number of Fuel3D scanners along with a MeshUp license for only $1090! The Uformia team are delighted with Fuel3D's data quality and how easy it is to work with in their software. \nCombining of two separate scans from Fuel3D in Meshup\nWatch the video..\n3D printing \u2013 As with software there are a multitude of 3D printers on the market. Recently two really exciting products came to fame right here on Kickstarter! The Form 1 3D printer from Formlabs produces high-resolution, high-quality prints that capture the full-detail of the Fuel3D.  Pirate 3D's Buccaneer produces low-cost ABS prints, that allow you to create scans easily. We are in discussions with both manufacturers and hope to bring you positive news about technical and commercial collaborations.\nIn addition to these technical collaborations we are also working closely with London based iMakr\niMakr is an online store selling a wide range of 3D printers and materials, 3D art and 3D scanners and also operates the world largest 3D Printing store over 2 floors in central London. \u201cUsing a typical 3D scanner to capture an image can take a long time and requires the subject to remain very still,\u201d said Sylvain Preumont, founder of iMakr. \u201cWith Fuel3D, you will be able to simply click one button to capture a very high quality 3D model of your subject in just a few seconds. Combine this with the incredible price they are selling it for and Fuel3D makes us very excited!\u201d\nThe competition\nMany different types of 3D scanner are available today, with prices ranging from a few hundred, up to hundreds of thousands of dollars, each with different capabilities and limitations. We believe that Fuel3D\u2019s flexibility, quality and low price point gives us a unique position in the market and is a recipe for success\u2026 the table below outlines our key advantages against the other main types of scanner.\nScan data comparison: Fuel3D on the left and Kinect (aligned but un-merged meshes) on the right\nFuel3D limited edition T-shirt and sculpture of Fuel3D face scan", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nDevelopment Risk\n\nThe development of the Fuel3D scanner is low-risk. The Fuel3D development program is essentially a re-configuration of an established technology that has already been successfully deployed in high-end medical applications. The objectives of the re-configuration are: to reduce cost while maintaining current system performance; reduce product size and weight; \u2018tether\u2019 the device to a PC/Mac so images are automatically exported for processing; and removal of medical regulatory required features and unnecessary components.\n\nThe functional prototype shown in the video has had many of the required modifications already made. It is not in the final form, we have engineering diagrams that show the layout of all the remaining components that will be needed in the final product. This format needs to be market tested in order to ensure its suitability.\n\nManufacturing plan\n\nFuel3D will use a specialized outsource manufacturing partner to assemble the final product. We are already talking with several trusted companies and will shortly make a final decision about which partner we will proceed with. The success of this manufacturing program is therefore not reliant on new production capabilities and facilities being developed by Fuel3D directly. The outsource manufacture facilities being considered all specialize in working with technologies like Fuel3D, and have already been proven highly capable, therefore manufacturing risk is minimized. \n\nThe following key points outline what has been accomplished so far and what is still required in the manufacturing plan:\n\nCompleted:\n\n1. Take an existing medical device, remove the non essential medical related items\n2. Produce beta software that removes the medical specific application including encryption \n3. Take a wide range of images and check functionality of system\n4. Prove system performs are required accuracy level\n5. Develop trimming software and trim a variety of images\n6. Export files to 3rd party software, Meshup and Meshlab\n7. Create full 360 3D models in 3rd party software\n8. Check water tightness of images and suitability for proposed applications\n9. 3D print a selection of images or import into games development environment\n10. Go, no-go decision on design\n11. Produce a final bill of materials (BoM) to validate pricing\n12. In pro-engineer assemble BoM into a proposed design\n\nStill to complete\n\n13. Test product demand on Kickstarter\n14. Appoint final manufacturer to assemble new product\n15. Produce beta hardware of final Fuel3D design\n16. Test Beta hardware \n17. Modify hardware as appropriate\n18. Manufacture first batch for Kickstarter customers\n\nOur Software development, in addition to the functionality detailed above, requires testing and developing for the Fuel3D platform:\n\n1. Gather the exiting software functions into an integrated suite that allows smooth capture, manipulation and export (in common formats including .STL, .PLY, .OBJ) images\n2. Develop further algorithms that broaden the suitability of the system to capture scans of other objects \n3. Add support for Mac OS\n4. Optimize algorithms/software for revised Fuel-3D hardware\n\nPeople\n\nOne of a young company\u2019s greatest challenges is often its people, but Fuel3D brings together an expert team, including the originator of the core technology, Prof. Ron Daniel of Oxford University, who is serving as the company\u2019s technical advisor. The management team consists of highly qualified individuals and between them have great strength in depth, which is supported by qualifications and accolades, including a winner of the MacRobert Award, the UK\u2019s most prestigious award for engineering, winner of two Queen\u2019s Awards for Enterprise, which recognize outstanding achievement by UK businesses, as well as a three-time finalist for Scottish Entrepreneur of the Year.\n\nWe have the expertise in-house to complete this project, and make Fuel3D a reality.\n\nStephen Crossland, Chief Marketing Officer & Kickstarter project leader\nStephen joined the Fuel3D team in 2013 bringing seven years of sales and marketing experience from a Fortune 500 company in the medical industry. A graduate of West Virginia University, Stephen previously owned and ran an electronics consultation and installation business. Stephen has a passion for 3D and is highly motivated to make the US market a huge success.\n\nStuart Mead, CEO Fuel3D\nStuart has a 25-year history in disruptive technology and is a senior sales and marketing pro. He was CEO of multi-award winning prosthetics company, Touch Bionics and learnt start-up at biopharmaceuticals manufacturer Excell Biotech. Previously he was a senior manager in both Kodak Clinical Diagnostics and Johnson & Johnson. As a former professional motorsport racer Stuart loves the speed of fast companies like Fuel3D.\n\nDr. James Paterson, CTO\nJames is co-founder and co-inventor of the technology underlying Fuel3D. James left Oxford University to work for the company full-time after completing his D. Phil in Engineering. He has authored numerous patents and publications and has led the development and delivery of the technical aspects of the company since its inception. Jamie has lived and breathed 3D scanning for 7 years; he dreams of 3D sheep!\n\nProf. Ron Daniel\nRon Daniel is a University Lecturer in Engineering Science at Oxford University, and Fellow and Tutor in Engineering at Brasenose College, Oxford. He is co-founder of Fuel3D. In 2006 he was elected as a member of the University\u2019s Audit and Scrutiny Committee. Ron\u2019s expertise and gravitas provides an excellent balance to Fuel3D\u2019s energetic and passionate team.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #45", "update_userinfo": "Special announcement for our Kickstarter friends", "update_content": "We\u2019ve done it - all our Kickstarter pledges have shipped!\nFollowing a great effort over the last few months, we are extremely pleased to say that all Kickstarter units have now been shipped to our wonderful backers.

Can't divulge more, but query Fuel3D support about an interim stitching solution. As for the current release of \"Fuel3D Studio\", it's been manageable with a minimum of crashing. I've dedicated the right-side USB port of my rMBP (bootcamp Win7) for the Fuel3D. Reverifying specs indicate BOTH my USB ports are USB 3.0 so Patrick's issue might be isolated. Uformia's still not ready with their version of MeshUp for us backers. \"Within next couple weeks\" according to them. Alternative is if you're willing to help them beta-test.

All other scanners impose a TEMPORAL penalty to acquire it's scan -- not something you can have when the subject is fidgety. Fuel3D's marketing seriously needs to pound on this point repeatedly.

Thank you!  \n\"This is the single most important robotics product since the Arduino.\"  Ted Macy, Contributing Editor, Robot Magazine\n\"Charmed Labs is bringing the eventual robot uprising one step closer with their camera sensor.\"  Chris-Rachael Oseland, Austin Post\n\"This vision sensor could be the future eyes of robots.\"  Mashable.com\n\"The sheer power, flexibility and ease of use of Pixy could kick-start a whole new generation of robotics.\"  Codeduino.com\n\"It\u2019s revolutionary because of its speed and simplicity.\"  StartupsFM\nUpdate: we recently made another video!  It shows Pixy playing with some lasers, and potentially bugging some cats, although no actual cats were annoyed in the video.  Watch below:\n\nBackground\nImage sensors are useful because they are so flexible. With the right algorithm, an image sensor can sense or detect practically anything.  But there are two drawbacks with image sensors: 1) they output lots of data, dozens of megabytes per second, and 2) processing this amount of data can overwhelm many processors.  And if the processor can keep up with the data, much of its processing power won't be available for other tasks.  \nPixy addresses these problems by pairing a powerful dedicated processor with the image sensor.  Pixy processes images from the image sensor and only sends the useful information (e.g. purple dinosaur detected at x=54, y=103) to your microcontroller.  And it does this at frame rate (50 Hz).  The information is available through one of several interfaces: UART serial, SPI, I2C, digital out, or analog out.  So your Arduino or other microcontroller can talk easily with Pixy and still have plenty of CPU available for other tasks.  \nIt's possible to hook up multiple Pixys to your microcontroller -- for example, a robot with 4 Pixys and 360 degrees of sensing.  Or use Pixy without a microcontroller and use the digital or analog outputs to trigger events, switches, servos, etc. \nPixy easily connects to Arduino or other microcontrollers.\nPurple dinosaurs (and other things)\nPixy uses a hue-based color filtering algorithm to detect objects.  Most of us are familiar with RGB (red, green, and blue) to represent colors.  Pixy calculates the hue and saturation of each RGB pixel from the image sensor and uses these as the primary filtering parameters.  The hue of an object remains largely unchanged with changes in lighting and exposure.  Changes in lighting and exposure can have a frustrating effect on color filtering algorithms, causing them to break.  Pixy\u2019s filtering algorithm is robust when it comes to lighting and exposure changes and significantly better than previous versions of the CMUcam.  \nSeven color signatures\nPixy remembers up to 7 different color signatures, which means that if you have 7 different objects with unique colors, Pixy\u2019s color filtering algorithm will have no problem identifying them.  If you need more than seven, you can use color codes (see below).  \nHundreds of objects\nPixy can find literally hundreds of objects at a time.  It uses a connected components algorithm to determine where one object begins and another ends.  Pixy then compiles the sizes and locations of each object and reports them through one of its interfaces (e.g. SPI).  \nPixy can track multiple objects with multiple color signatures (PixyMon view shown.)\n50 frames per second\nWhat does \u201c50 frames per second\u201d mean?  In short, it means Pixy is fast.  Pixy processes an entire 640x400 image frame every 1/50th of a second (20 milliseconds).  This means that you get a complete update of all detected objects' positions every 20 ms.  At this rate, tracking the path of falling/bouncing ball is possible.  (A ball traveling at 30 mph moves less than a foot in 20 ms.)   \nPixy is fast, so your robot can be fast -- shown with glasses and wig (optional).\nTeach it the objects you're interested in\nPixy is unique because you can physically teach it what you are interested in sensing.  Purple dinosaur?  Place the dinosaur in front of Pixy and press the button.  Orange ball?  Place the ball in front of Pixy and press the button.  It\u2019s easy, and it's fast.    \nMore specifically, you teach Pixy by holding the object in front of its lens while holding down the button located on top.  While doing this, the RGB LED under the lens provides feedback regarding which object it is looking at directly.  For example, the LED turns orange when an orange ball is placed directly in front of Pixy.  Release the button and Pixy generates a statistical model of the colors contained in the object and stores them in flash.  It will then use this statistical model to find objects with similar color signatures in its frame from then on.  \nPixy being taught. When color LED matches the color of the object, release button. Pixy will then find objects that match.\nPixy can learn seven color signatures, numbered 1-7.  Color signature 1 is the default signature.  To teach Pixy the other signatures (2-7) requires a simple button pressing sequence.      \nAbout the cost of two sonar sensors\nWe\u2019ve done our best to keep the cost of Pixy as low as possible.  Improvements in technology deserve much of the credit, but this Kickstarter campaign is a big help also.  The Kickstarter funds allow us to manufacture in sufficient quantity to get the parts and manufacturing costs down.  The result is that Pixy is available to a wider audience, which has always been the point of the CMUcam: to put a capable, easy to use vision sensor in the hands of lots of people.\nPixyMon lets you see what Pixy sees\nPixyMon is an application that runs on your PC or Mac.  It allows you to see what Pixy sees, either as raw or processed video.  It also allows you to configure your Pixy, set the output port and manage color signatures.  PixyMon communicates with Pixy over a standard mini USB cable.\nPixyMon is great for debugging your application.  You can plug a USB cable into the back of Pixy and run PixyMon and then see what Pixy sees while it is hooked to your Arduino or other microcontroller -- no need to unplug anything.  PixyMon is open source, like everything else.  It's written using the Qt framework.  \nPixyMon runs on PC or Mac and allows you to see what Pixy sees. Communication takes place over standard USB cable.\nWhat\u2019s a \u201ccolor code\u201d?\nA color code (CC) is two or more color tags placed close together.  Pixy can detect and decode CCs and present them as special objects.  CCs are useful if you have lots of objects you want to detect and identify (i.e. more than could be detected with the seven separate color signatures alone.)  \nSimple color code (left), as Pixy sees it (right, shown via PixyMon)\nIn the video, we created CCs with 2 color tags using 4 different colors (identified by teaching Pixy 4 different color signatures).  Depending on your requirements, such a scheme (2 tags, 4 colors) can detect up to 12 unique objects.  CCs with 3, 4 and 5 tags and/or more different colors are possible and can allow for many, many more unique objects.  (In fact, thousands of unique codes are possible by using CCs with 5 tags and 6 colors.  Hello inkjet printer!)  \nWhy Color Codes?  \nCCs are useful if you have lots of objects you want to detect and identify, more than could be detected with the seven separate color signatures alone. CCs also improve detection accuracy by decreasing false detections.  That is, there is a low probability that specific colors will occur both in a specific order and close together.  The drawback is that you need to place a CC on each object you\u2019re interested in detecting.  Often the object you\u2019re interested in (yellow ball, purple toy) has a unique color signature and CCs aren\u2019t needed.  Objects with CCs and objects without CCs can be used side-by-side with no problems, so you are free to use CCs for some objects and not others.\nCCs give you an accurate angle estimate of the object (in addition to the position and size).  This is a computational \u201cfreebie\u201d that some applications may find useful.  The angle estimate, decoded CCs, regular objects and all of their positions and sizes are provided at 50 frames per second.   \nCCs might be particularly useful for helping a robot navigate.  For example, an indoor environment with CCs uniquely identifying each doorway and hallway would be both low-cost and robust.  \nThe team\nRich LeGrand has been playing with robots and embedded systems for 25 years.  He started Charmed Labs in 2002 with the goal of \u201cbringing advanced technologies to new audiences by making the technologies easy to use and affordable.  And to have fun in the process.\u201d  (That's Pixy!)  \nScott Robinson started working on Pixy as a graduate student at CMU.  His focus has typically been in embedded systems, AI, and computer vision, which is why the CMUcam has been such a great fit for him. He's now working at Sandia National Laboratories as an R&D Engineer and is continuing to provide frequent updates to the CMUcam project. You can check out his blog at stackabuse.com\nAnthony Rowe is a faculty member at Carnegie Mellon University who has worked in the area of embedded systems for more than a decade   His group at CMU studies the design of next generation connected sensing and control systems.  Part of this work included earlier versions of the CMUcam, which we hope to take to the next level through this project.  \nHow will the funds be used?\nIn order to get the pricing down for Pixy, we need to manufacture in sufficient quantities (1000 or more.)  The funds will be used to buy parts and to make manufacturing and test fixtures for future builds.  \nTechnical specs\nProcessor: NXP  LPC4330, 204 MHz, dual core\nImage sensor: Omnivision OV9715, 1/4\", 1280x800\nLens field-of-view: 75 degrees horizontal, 47 degrees vertical\nLens type: standard M12 (several different types available)\nPower consumption: 140 mA typical\nPower input: USB input (5V) or unregulated input (6V to 10V)\nRAM: 264K bytes\nFlash: 1M bytes\nAvailable data outputs: UART serial, SPI, I2C, USB, digital, analog\nDimensions: 2.1\" x 1.75\" x 1.4\"\nPixy running your algorithm\nPixy will ship with the software and firmware that will do everything seen in the video and described here.  You can use this software and firmware as-is (we expect 90% of users to do this.)  Or you can build on it, modify it, or completely replace it.  Pixy is a good, low-cost, general purpose vision platform for running other algorithms -- a QR code decoder, a face detector, an interactive pointing device (a la mouse), or something entirely different and new.  All software and firmware is open source and GPL licensed.  All hardware is open under the Open Source Hardware License. (This means you can do pretty much anything you want -- even sell what you've created.)  \nPixy's ports (back of Pixy)\nI/O port pinouts\nCommunication (protocols and such)\nPixy communicates through UART, SPI, I2C, digital or analog output.  You can configure which interface you want to use through PixyMon.  The serial interfaces (UART, SPI, I2C) use a simple binary protocol.  Every 20 ms, Pixy outputs a list of objects it has detected with each object represented by an \"Object Block\" (see below).  \nThe protocol is data-efficient binary.\nThe objects in each frame are sorted by size, with the largest objects sent first.\nYou can configure the maximum number of objects sent per frame\nI2C relies on polling to receive updates.  \nUSB is also available, and uses a different protocol (same protocol Pixymon uses.)\n\nObject Block data fields. Pixy sends an Object Block for each detected object in each frame.\nNo microcontroller necessary\nPixy can also use a simple digital and analog output to communicate with simple devices such as relays, motors and lights.  \nWhen communicating via analog, the analog output represents the X or Y position of the largest detected object of a specified color signature that exceeds a specified size.\nWhen communicating through digital, the digital output goes high when an object of a specified color signature exceeds a specified size.\n\nDesign longevity\nImage sensors are consumer devices -- new sensors are released every year that take advantage of new process technologies, and older sensors are discontinued.  It's not unusual for an image sensor to have a lifetime of only a couple years.  Any device that uses an image sensor will have to contend with this issue -- there will come a day when the specific image sensor in the design will no longer be available.  Previous CMUcams had this problem and had to be discontinued.  \nPixy addresses this issue on several fronts:\nWe chose an image sensor that is targeted for the automotive industry.  Automotive products (silicon devices) have longer lifetimes.\nWe chose a basic sensor with raw Bayer output.  This is the most common type of sensor, and when/if we need to switch sensors, we will have a large selection to choose from, and the code changes will be minimal.\nWe did not choose a camera module (sensor/lens combination).  We mount the image sensor ourselves and use a standard M12 lens holder and lens.  Camera modules tend to have the shortest product lifetimes because they target the fast-paced smart phone, tablet, and laptop industry.  An M12 lens is also replaceable -- you can choose a different lens with a field-of-view and f-stop that works best for your application.  (We chose a lens with a 75-degree horizontal field-of-view and f1.2, which is great for robotics applications, but you can easily replace.)  \nPixy is ready \nWe have lined up a reputable contract manufacturer that can easily handle the quantities we anticipate.  They will handle all component procurement, PCB fabrication, component placement and assembled product testing.  This contract manufacturer was able to complete every manufacturing step and deliver a working product in our most recent production run.  When we have the funds for a larger production run, our contract manufacturer will be ready!   ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nPixy has already been through two revisions and two small production runs. The current version is mature and ready for production. The latest was a trial production run with the contract manufacturer that we plan to use for large-quantity production. Still, there are risks with any hardware product, particularly with parts procurement and manufacturing issues, but we feel we have reduced these risks significantly. \n\nWe have verified all algorithms that will ship with the completed version, but there is still a fair amount of software that needs to be readied for release.

I met the Spark team at their homecoming party here in Minneapolis, and there was major enthusiasm from both sides about the Choosatron and Spark Core. It was a perfect fit! After working with their team, I\u2019m proud to announce that the Choosatron will now be built on the Spark platform, including a Spark Core as part of the kit - a $39 value!\nBy adding Wi-Fi and Spark we've expanded the possibilities:\ngroup vote choices via mobile devices at an event\ncapture and visualize how people play your stories\nswap out the stories for different occasions - you don't need wireless to play!\nover-the-shoulder mode to say live play on your mobile\nmanage multiple Choosatrons, and so much more!\nWHERE DOES THE MONEY GO?\nThe Choosatron isn\u2019t just an idea. It is here. After three prototypes over the last year, the first kit has been developed to be affordable, easy to assemble, and friendly to modifying both hardware and software.\nMoney will go toward:\nGetting the Choosatron into everyone\u2019s hands!\nRecouping the development costs from prior to this Kickstarter. I've been funding the Choosatron development myself because I believe in the impact the project can have.\nPaying authors for their talent and time.\nDesign 2 of the Choosatron board: smaller, smarter, and more cost effective!\nDesign 2 of the Choosatron enclosure: more fun, approachable, functional, and more attention to design!\nBuild the new Choosatron software platform on the Spark Cloud so writing and sharing stories is as simple as possible.\nPreparing hardware and software files for open sourcing, including documentation to make it as accessible as possible.\nNew features and enhancements to the Choosatron firmware, so authors have more options for how they design their stories.\n\nREWARD DETAILS\nAny additions to the rewards will be outlined here since rewards can\u2019t be edited. I\u2019ll also give more details about some of the rewards to make sure they are clear.\nREWARD ADD-ONs\nPaper Refills: Refills are 5 rolls for $20, and 9 for $30 and are BPA free. You can order as many paper refills, appropriate to your reward level, as you like. Just keep multiplying the cost of the refill, and add that to your funding total. Rolls are 2 1/4\" wide and 85 feet long.\nInternational Paper Refills: Any paper roll order starts with a base of $4. For each roll, add another $5. These are also 85 feet and BPA free. If you are planning on ordering a larger quantity, message me and I may be able to price better. Just add this amount to your pledge and we'll figure it out in the survey after the Kickstarter.\n(quantity x $5) + $4 = total\nOrder 1 roll: (1 x $5) + $4 = $9 (not a great deal)\nOrder 5 rolls: (5 x $5) + $4 = $29 (that isn't too bad!)\nPrint Choosatron Book: Add only $29 to any reward that includes a CHOOSATRON KIT to get the print book as well. That\u2019s $10 off the book only reward! Add $34 to get the print book SIGNED. (shipped separately, add $20 to ship outside the US)\nShipping: Don\u2019t forget to add shipping if you are not in the US! Costs are listed at the bottom of each reward description, and in the details above.\nHave an idea or opportunity you\u2019d like to discuss?\nEmail me! I think the Choosatron has a lot of great opportunities, and I\u2019d love to discuss any you might have in mind. For my sake, please send as many details as possible. Thanks!\n\nWHO IS JERRY BELICH?\nI\u2019m a software developer of over ten years, currently the senior mobile developer at Clockwork in Minneapolis, MN. I love game design, storytelling, play a mean theremin, stay involved in local theatre as an actor, director, and comedian, and dabble in sweding movies.\nI\u2019ve had an eclectic career using technology as my creative tool:\nI was one of only three developers who created environmental software that runs/syncs 384 screens inside one of the largest/newest casinos in Las Vegas.\nI worked for Ray Bradbury as the director of digital effects for the first stage production of Fahrenheit 451 (one of the most HOLY CRAP THIS IS AWESOME times of my life)\nI integrated video and stage at the Ordway\u2019s Rocky Horror Picture Show  in St. Paul, MN\n\nOver the last year, while developing the Choosatron, I\u2019ve also been consulting as a professional engineer and storyteller for public spaces, such as exhibits at the Minnesota History Center. I taught a class at the Loft Literary Center in Minneapolis in August 2013, about interactive fiction and creative writing, where each student built their own Choosatron. Contact me to learn about education related opportunities!\nI want to use what I\u2019ve learned through years of research and experience to create a platform that takes storytelling everywhere we go. The Choosatron is my first big step towards bringing invention and storytelling hand-in-hand to a new generation.\n\nWHEN WILL I GET MY CHOOSATRON?\nMost rewards are currently promised for quarter one of next year. I am working with vetted sources for both manufacturing and distribution to ensure that kits can be produced on a large scale and in a timely manner. Now that the Choosatron is powered by Spark Core, I also have the support of their brilliant team, and can benefit from their first hand work in China. As soon as final designs are sent (within a few weeks of this ending), I will be able to update all of you on how many units will ship by what dates.\nIn a nutshell:\nDuring Kickstarter: Estimates for the Spark Powered iteration of the Choosatron will be received, prototypes ordered.\nAugust 30th: Kickstarter ends.\n- Story editing begins.\n- Hardware enhancements (if any from stretch goals) begin.\nSeptember 13th: Kickstarter releases the funding to me.\n- Complete designs and develop test plan.\nOctober 1st: Choosatron author story drafts due.\nOctober 15th: Final stories will be due, book prep in full swing.\nDevelopment of kits underway by now, updates flowing forth!\nLegal notice: Choose Your Own Adventure\u00ae is a registered trademark of Chooseco LLC.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe Choosatron hardware and software have been functional since last summer, and even survived a five week trip to the UK. I\u2019ve had feedback from hundreds of people to help make this kit as fun, versatile, and affordable as possible, while still leaving room to fund further development. I\u2019ve worked in tech professionally for over ten years, have run my own business for over eight, and have had the support of at least half a dozen Kickstarter veterans (including the wonderful people at Spark Devices, go get one!) and frankly, I\u2019m known for completing epic and difficult projects because I LOVE IT. I\u2019m no stranger to managing teams and intense deadlines.\n\nAlthough it\u2019s my first foray into manufacturing, the companies involved are all proven in both reputation and quality, both through fellow Kickstarters and elsewhere. I have been fastidious about reducing cost and waste, and developing a distribution relationship so you aren\u2019t stuck waiting for me to pack and ship boxes.\n\nThe concept for the Choosatron has been proven both functionally and with many happy audiences, as well as engaging kids in an exciting way. I have gone through four functioning prototypes, one being the first iteration of the kit for this Kickstarter, with the second on its way, and its time for this little bird to fly!\n\nThe minimum funding will be enough to improve and refine the existing designs and create a better user experience, especially for the younger audience. Base funding will focus on quality, rather than adding lots of extra features and letting scope creep cripple progress. As soon as that goal is met, we can all start getting creative about what happens next!\n\nAs for the book, the risk is handling a bunch of writers that may or may not hit their deadlines! They have all been provided a lot of content and guidance to get the ball rolling, and have their deadlines for providing me drafts, and final version. It\u2019s possible some authors disappear, but others will surely end up taking their place. I also have friends that have self-published many times, and a GREAT editor, so I feel pretty good about it!\n\nI will keep everyone informed with regular updates, good, bad, or boring via Facebook, Twitter, my website, and Kickstarter.

CLOUDS presents a generative portrait of this digital arts community in a videogame-like environment. The artists inhabit a shared space with their code-based creations, allowing you to follow your curiosity through a network of stories.\nWhat does it feel like to think with code? How can emerging technologies enable us to actualize our dreams? How has online sharing transformed the way artists collaborate?\nA preview of the CLOUDS film, science fiction author Bruce Sterling speaks aloud about the art of code.\nTHE STORY\nThe creative practitioners featured in the documentary represent a new breed of interdisciplinary artists who combine software engineering, audiovisual design, and cultural engagement. CLOUDS explores the themes of creativity, aesthetics, simulation, and sharing articulated by these luminaries in the computational arts community.\nCounter to the widespread perception of code as exclusively utilitarian, this generation of hacker-artists struggles to develop new forms of visual expression, expanding the vocabulary of technology to resonate at a deeper human level. In an increasingly data-driven culture, our subjects act as intermediaries who can help us to navigate and make sense of our evolving digital universe.\nStorytellers featured in CLOUDS\nThe interview subjects in CLOUDS include Bruce Sterling, Casey Reas, Daniel Shiffman, Diederick Huijbers, Elliot Woods, Golan Levin, Greg Borenstein, Jer Thorp, Jesse Louis-Rosenberg, Jessica Rosenkrantz, Joel Gethin Lewis, Josh Nimoy, Julia Kaganskiy, Julian Oliver, Karolina Sobecka, Karsten \u201cToxi\u201d Schmidt, Kyle Chayka, Kyle McDonald, Lindsay Howard, Marcus Wendt, Marius Watz, Nick Fox-Gieg, Paola Antonelli, Philip Whitfield, Rachel Binx, Regine Debatty, Satoru Higa, Shantell Martin, Sofy Yuditskaya, Theodore Watson, Vera Glahn, and Zachary Lieberman.\n A documentary in a videogame environment\nThe CLOUDS experience is generated from a database of richly tagged interviews. For you, the viewer, the story begins with your curiosity. You input a question or search term as the starting point, setting the initial trajectory. Just as an everyday conversation will often flow through series of digressions, each subject you encounter offers branching paths to unexplored regions of the video collection. A unique narrative experience is generated just for you. You can sit back and watch the story conversation unfold, or let your interaction with the system guide you toward surprising outcomes.\nVisualization of the CLOUDS network\nThe CLOUDS documentary comes in the form of an application for Mac or Windows, presenting a full-screen, immersive, interactive audio-visual experience.\nBe the first to experience CLOUDS: own a collectible data capsule\nCLOUDS Data capsule with laser etched 3D pointcloud\n\nA collectible object containing the CLOUDS installer\nPremiere screening at Eyebeam NYC\nIf you are in the NYC area, consider donating for a ticket to our launch at Eyebeam in Chelsea! There you\u2019ll see the film presented as an installation, meet the filmmakers and catch a few CLOUDS participants in person.\nClouds: Beta\nIn May we premiered Clouds: Beta, a pilot version of the project in a short video screened at Eyebeam. Since then, we have continued production with the intention of building the documentary in an interactive environment..\nA film about creative technologies, using an emerging medium\nCLOUDS is created with the RGBDToolkit -- an open-source software library we have developed for 3D filmmaking with the Kinect. Using a Microsoft XBOX Kinect depth sensor paired with an HD video camera, our toolkit makes possible the computer-graphic/video hybrid you see above. By supporting CLOUDS, you also support the development of the RGBDToolkit -- helping to make it better for everyone. We welcome you to try it out!\nRGBD Filmmaking DIY Toolkit\nThe toolkit package contains 3D printable mounts to securely fasten the cameras, and custom software for calibrating, recording data, and visualizing it as full color three dimensional forms. Check out the RGBD tumblr to see the spectacular projects by other filmmakers who have adopted this format.\n\nHelp support RGBDToolkit version 1.0\nIn addition to completing the film, we will be releasing version 1.0 of the RGBDToolkit application. This will include several new features requested by the community including support across Mac, Windows and Linux, integration with Maya and Cinema 4D, easier and more accurate camera calibration, and new effects!\nIf you\u2019re interested in making your own movies using this technique, check out the \"Filmmaker\" reward or host your own depth filmmaking workshop.\nDepth filmmaking workshop at Hangar in Barcelona\nHow will you use the Kickstarter funds?\nWe need to expand our team to realize the complete interactive version of CLOUDS. Combining the workflows of documentary filmmaking and videogame production in a new format will involve coding, art direction, sound, editing, and interaction design. The majority of the funds will go to supplementing our two-person collaborative to a small team of co-creators.\nWe are working closely with several of the coders featured in the film to create new generative works embedded in the world of CLOUDS, allowing these artists to co-exist with their own creations in a computationally generated space! The Kickstarter\u2019s success will ensure that we can compensate the artists as we collaborate to incorporate their work into the film.\nSupporting Partners\nIt takes a community to make a film of this nature. To reach this stage in production, we have benefited from the help of friends and colleagues, including several key media arts organizations. In particular, we'd like to thank The Frank-Ratchye STUDIO for Creative Inquiry, Eyebeam Center for Art and Technology, YCAM InterLab, and NYU's ITP program for supporting us as we pursue the dream of an interactive documentary.\nSpecial thanks to the Resonate and Eyeo festivals for inviting our crew to record interviews with their amazing presenters, and to capture the energy of these events in the film.\nYour contribution to this project will ensure that the voices of these artists will be heard in a way never before possible.\nYours,\nJames and Jonathan", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAdopting a real time paradigm\n\nThe RGBD data is computationally intense to visualize. We've already achieved smooth frame rates using this format for real-time installations, such as \u201cSpectacle of Change,\u201d (http://jamesgeorge.org/works/spectacle.html) so we know it can work. But creating the full interactive experience required by CLOUDS, that can run on a modern laptop and includes visual design, generative storytelling, and user interaction will require advancement in our techniques. We\u2019ve already begun experiments that move the computation to shaders on the GPU, and are excited to overcome these challenges using data pre-processing, optimization, and design.\n\nExtracting compelling narratives\n\nAs this is a documentary, the story is crucial. An essential component of our process involves designing algorithms to explore a database of ideas and conversations. Taking a generative approach to storytelling runs the risk of producing sequences that feel disjointed or repetitive.

They\u2019re also good at notifying you of important things, like whether you might like the taste of something or if you left the gas on.\nWe wanted to see how this could affect our online experiences, especially on social platforms such as Twitter. That was the spark that led to the creation of Olly.\nOlly is a modular platform, so he can be added to very easily with new modules. The first of these new Modules is Molly. We would like to be able to build many new modules for the Olly platform in the future. We're keen to explore human factors such as smell\nWhere does your pledge go?\nWe need a few things to get Olly and Molly out into the world:\n1: Tooling the molds to make Olly\u2019s outer case.\n2: Further developing our app to include platforms like Facebook, Instagram and email.\n3: Creating additional modules for Olly (like Molly).\nSo...\nWe think it\u2019s awesome that small companies like us can have a go at making physical things that big companies might be a bit scared to do.\nWe'd really like to turn ollyfactory.com into a platform for creating and distributing web connected objects. It\u2019s you guys that can make this possible, and contribute to what you think we should make next.\nWe're also excited about exploring the potential of locally producing all of the products we make. There are some really interesting things happening with small scale manufacture at the moment and we want to explore this avenue.\nWe can't wait to get Olly and Molly out there and will keep you updated every step of the way.\nThanks very much for checking out our project and have an awesome day.\nNote: The code and digital files for Olly are all licensed under a Creative Commons license so if anyone wants to mess about with an Olly for themselves, or develop some new apps, they will be able to do so.
