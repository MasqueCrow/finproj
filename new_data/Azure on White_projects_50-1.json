Carefully manoeuvre the town\u2019s retainers to gather resources, build buildings, complete the Shogun\u2019s tasks, and win favour.  The most prosperous Daimyo will be granted the title to the town.\nTight, tactical movement and strategic decisions\nPerfect for travelling (pocket-sized)\nRandomised setup and advanced play variants for replayability (~3 billion combinations) \nDesigned for low-cost shipping\nColour-blind Friendly\nMicro Dojo is complete at launch, meaning no long wait for you to get your game! Shipping for the first 500 copies will be 2-4 weeks after campaign ends.\n\nShipping is charged at checkout through the Kickstarter platform so there are no additional costs at the end of the campaign.  For multiple copies, simply select the 2+ Copies pledge level and additional copies can be added as Kickstarter Add-Ons (for no extra shipping cost). \nRetailers - Please reach out to me here for retail options.\n Micro Dojo is ultra compact, fitting on a single sheet of token punchboard sized to fit perfectly into a protected envelope. In the envelope you'll receive:\nPunchboard sheet with game board tokens\n1-page folding printed rulebook in English\nResealable plastic bag for holding all components \nSolo mode AI card deck and rules \nImmediately after the campaign ends, no matter your pledge, you'll be sent access to the following digital files:\nPrint-and-Play high resolution PDF\nRulebook translations - Japanese, Spanish, Dutch, Italian, Arabic, Greek, French, German \n3D printable box (digital STL file) \nMicro Dojo is a game of tactical movement, where you will need to plan ahead and anticipate your opponents moves to be successful. Players acquire resources, purchase buildings to unlock abilities, and score shared objectives to gain points. The winner is the first to reach 7 points, or the player with the highest score after the final objective has been triggered. \nA player's turn has two parts. First they (1) move one of the meeples into an empty space, either horizontally or vertically, and then (2) resolve the ability there. Once the turn is complete, the player places their daimyo marker onto the meeple, indicating that it is no longer available. As the daimyo markers move throughout the game, there will normally be two available meeples to choose from.\n\nWatch the How to Play Video (2:40)  \n Solo Mode (1:49)\n\n Download the Rulebook \n    (Translations available) \n Try it out on Tabletop Simulator (TTS) \nMeeples on the Ground   \nWV Gamers   \nAdditional Reviews\nHungry Gamer (YouTube)\nBoards Eye View (Blog)\nPlayer Layer (Instagram)\nPlayer Layer (YouTube)\nGaming with Edo (YouTube)\nWV Gamers (Blog)\nTabletop United (Blog)\nBoardgame Fever (Instagram - Dutch)\nGrAlutka (YouTube - Polish)\n\u90aa\u4e4b\u63a8\u624b Evil Mastermind Gamer   (Blog - Chinese)\n Micro Dojo is a tiny game, with simple artwork, but that doesn't mean it can't tell a story. I've been fortunate enough to have a number of people input on the cultural and historical aspects of the game. These people not only advised on the accuracy and sensitivity of the material, but also added many suggestions that made it into the final version. They get an extra special Thank You in the section below. It was really important to me that the features and artwork in the game be accurate to Edo period Japan as much as possible, and I've shared some of how this has been achieved here.\nThe victory point symbol is represented by the Tokugawa Shogunate mon, the ruling family for the Edo period that you as a Daimyo are trying to win favour with. Note that earlier versions of game had used the Imperial Seal of Japan before this change. The Daimyo markers for each player are also represented with the formal dress and eboshi.\nDaimyo formal costume, and Tokugawa Shogunate mon\nSome of the buildings in the game have been modelled on real buildings from the Edo period. In particular the Toi gold mine in Izu is represented by the Gold Mine in game, and the Castle is modelled on parts of Edo Castle in Tokyo:\nToi gold mine (Izu), and Fujima-yagura (Edo Castle keep)\nCompared to the early prototype, a number of the buildings also went through an evolution to be more historically correct. For example, the Baker became the Yatai (the travelling food stalls) and the Bank became the Broker (rice brokers being the precursors to modern banking). You might also notice that the early testing prototypes represented the food resource with bread instead of rice - a key change to make since bread wasn't as widespread until later in the period. \nEvolution of Building tiles, from prototype to final\nAlmost exactly four years ago I was travelling in Japan, and it's been my pleasure to work on researching and developing the theme for Micro Dojo in the absence of travel over the last year. It's my fond hope that Micro Dojo similarly inspires you to explore Japan, and why not pack a pocket-sized game in your bag for the trip.\n\nYou've read about the game, so time to introduce myself. I\u2019m Ben, and this campaign is the first of many for me and Prometheus Game Labs. During 2020 I started working on board game design as a creative outlet. It quickly evolved from inspiration to produce a board game to inspiration to produce many games and build a future in game design. Starting out with a micro game was a perfect environment to build trust, to build expertise, and to build fans for more games to come. \nMicro Dojo is deliberately small and simple to produce. No complicated manufacturing processes, no complicated stretch goals, and no complex pledge levels. The decision to fit all of the components onto a single envelope sized pieced of token punchboard was key, as it is:\nEasy to produce (only a single sheet is needed)\nCheap to ship (because no one wants to pay twice as much for a game in shipping) \nMinimises lost components or mispacked items (everything is right there on the sheet ready for you to punch out and play)\nThe low funding goal for the campaign is enough to be able to commission a print run locally and bring the game to life. \n\nRead more about the Micro Dojo mission here\n\n Micro Dojo is complete at launch, meaning it will be ready to ship as soon as the campaign has ended and Kickstarter has deposited the funds. The first 500 copies will be sent in a Wave 1 shipment, with further copies sent in Wave 2 a few months later.\n\n 28th August 2020 - First Prototype and playtest\n October 2020 - Artwork Commissioned\n February 2021 - Laser-Cut Prototypes Produced\n April - First Print Run for Wave 1\nMay - Campaign launches!\n Early June - Pledge Manager Survey\n June - Production begins for Wave 2\n Late June - Wave 1 shipments sent from UK \n Early August - Wave 2 shipments freight from UAE to UK\n September-October - Wave 2 shipments sent from UK.  \nCampaign complete!\n\nPledges will be shipped using Royal Mail UK (for UK and International) or Emirates Post (for UAE).

The project has been designed to be as simple to produce and fulfil as soon possible.\n\nManufacturing and Shipping delays are always a risk with board game production. The first wave shipping for 500 copies is planned for immediate fulfilment, where the second wave will be printed and sent via a freight service from the UAE to the UK before fulfilment.\n\nTo keep postage costs down, shipments are untracked, which could lead to a few items lost in the mail or delayed in reaching their final destination (particularly international destinations with less reliable postal services). I'll be printing additional copies to be able resend any which don't arrive in to their destination so backers won't miss out.\n\nThough it's every creators dream to reach as many people as possible, if the project massively overfunds this could introduce delays with shipping for Wave 2. The low price prohibits the use of a fulfilment partner, and so shipping in batches (along with all the extra administration) could be slower.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nReusability and recyclability\nMinimal plastics used in the project and recycled protected envelopes for shipping", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a31 or more", "title": "Support the Project & Print-and-Play", "descp": "Thank you for supporting Micro Dojo!

I planned to use Royal Mail\u2019s International shipping, being more cost effective and perhaps more reliable than shipping from the UAE, and it was also an opportunity to spend some time visiting family after over a year and a half of not travelling.

The outer plane of Hedophis, in which they dwelled for millennia, was torn apart in moments. Devoured by the oncoming tide of relentless demons, their death-screams herald a coming apocalypse. The once perfectly balanced tri-planes of Athien are now at risk of total collapse. Without the Effigy Network of Mid\u00ebon (Athien's middle plane) to shield them, nothing would stop the demons from consuming this universe. \nThe fate of Athien is now in the hands of the six ascending gods who competitively rule over Mid\u00ebon (also known as the Between). \nAs a Judgement player, you will take on the role of one of these gods. Your goal is to become the sole controller of the Effigy Network, which will imbue you with unheard-of power. Once you control the network, Athein will be yours to rule without interference.\nUsing the power of your Effigy, you can call forth your champions to fight for you and capture your opponent's Effigy. You will need to manage multiple resources and exploit synergies between your heroes to be victorious.  However, the opposing gods won't make it easy for you. Not only will you have to compete against the enemy warbands, but you must stay vigilant against the creatures and monsters that call Mid\u00ebon home.\nThe People Behind the Curtain\nGunmeister Games is comprised of Australian fraternal duo, Andrew Galea and Jeff Galea. They are the masterminds behind Judgement and have continued their game design work in the revamping and development of Judgement: Eternal Champions. \nCreature Caster is a Canadian (BC-based) miniatures company who specializes in artisanal, hand-poured resin kits. Until now, the company has focused on producing miniatures, so they are very excited to be creating their very first tabletop board game. \nThe Collaboration\nA fateful meeting between Creature Caster\u2019s Peter Adams and Gunmeister Games\u2019 Andrew Galea, at an Adepticon event in 2018, sparked this creative journey. Our two companies have formed a truly solid team, capable of conquering all of the challenges of creating and maintaining an enjoyable game. The Galea brothers have continued to develop and improve the rules and balance of the game, as well as building new hero and monster rule sets. Meanwhile, the Creature Caster team has been developing the art and feel of the game, as well as re-sculpting the old Judgement catalogue and bringing new Judgement: Eternal Champions characters to life! \nCreature Caster is working with our teams and partners to ensure that safety remains a priority.

A percentage of profits from every CheatKard set that you back will plant a tree in one of the worlds forests.\n\nThe Creation Of CheatKard\nLittle did we realize that back in 2018 we had invented what would become CheatKard when we designed the first Nerdonic PCB business reference card,  created with an aim to give clients and customers a more relevant business card compared to generic paper cards so they could see a glimpse of the world behind Electrical engineering.\nMany clients and fellow tech nerds loved the idea, with friends of clients who were interested in tech asking to get a business card too, simply because they thought it was cool to have.\nImage: One of the first reference based Nerdonic business cards from 2018, some aspects of the card still lives on within CheatKard such as the pin pitch and trace gauges\nFrom there we experimented and decided to make it into a product. Shortly after the first designs we used our contacts in other fields from photographers, doctors and surgeons, scientists, designers, mechanics, and more to help us design useful CheatKards in a wide range of categories!\n\n\nMore To Come!\nWe\u2019re working hard to finalize our Cheat Kards for a huge range of other topics, Electrical Engineering is just the start!\nTeaming up with respected professionals in their respective fields allows us to ensure nothing but the most accurate and useful information on all of our cards. \nWe have already started developing add-on sets for Electrical Engineering including information on Radio Frequencies, PCB Antenna design, Certification help and more!\nAs well as that we also have many other CheatKards being developed and on their way including sets in Computing, Adobe, Photography, Science, Medical, 3D Printing, Mathematics, Mechanical Engineering, DIY and much more!\n\nAs a way of thanking pledgers for their support, we are currently offering a set of limited edition cheatkards, exclusively for Kickstarter backers. These limited edition cards are available in the classic Kickstarter green with gold plated accents, as a little nod to Kickstarter.\n\nSpecifications\n\nThe Rewards\n\n\nAdd-On Items\nCustom Text Engraving\nHave your CheatKard set custom engraved with a message or name of your choice on the back of the cover card!

By unlocking this type of stretch goal, these models when complete will be added to the application and available for all normal backers, no Add-Ons required. \n**Any themes that are Add-on themes will require an additional $11 per Add-on Theme on top of the normal pledge if you choose an Unlimited Pass.\n\nLifetime Unlimited Imperial Terrain Downloads - This perk applies to Themes created in the Terrain Machine by Imperial Terrain.

All proceeds will go to those creators. If you are backing with an Unlimited Pass pledge, Each Add On is $11. Add-Ons will be handled through Kickstarter.

We decided instead of churning out limiting model sets, we wanted you, the backers/customers to be able to make exactly what you wanted!\n\nWhy Kickstarter?\nIt is our opinion that the best way to build a tool like this is to have as many people as possible use it! When you use the Terrain Machine, you will get ideas and inspiration for what you would like to see the Terrain Machine do in the future and pass those onto us. If you use something you like and enjoy you will support the product, which in turn supports our development!\n\nThe Future\nWe are using a different technology than a few of the other online creator tools that exist. Our technology is a game engine that allows us to do some pretty darn cool things that have not been possible before. As we learn and develop more features, we want the Terrain Machine to tap into some of those advanced physics and game creation tools to make the 3d printed terrain experience better than ever.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our first foray into a web based application which is why we are offering the ability for those interested to create an account and test drive the Terrain Machine themselves.

I remember very well everything you and Gandalf said when we met. You were alarmed, and I took your warnings at heart, but I don\u2019t think you would find it surprising to know that news of a nameless threat is hard to believe here in the dear old Shire. Gandalf came to see me again, on several occasions. He seems to care about our friendship, and he says I should indeed be worried, but his vague words of warning hardly make even less of a dent in the general sense of peace and protection that we enjoy here, away in the north-west. \nBut don\u2019t think that I am completely clueless! All I need to know is to have a look at\u2026 the stuff I collected in my adventures to remember that there is a wide and dangerous world out there. Sometimes I even miss it, the road, the thrill, the narrow escapes. It\u2019s my Tookish side. But then I look at my beautiful garden, my snapdragons and sunflowers, my trailing nasturtians\u2026 how they glow, red and golden, more beautiful than any Dragon-hoard that ever was, and I am back to being a Baggins. \nI hope that what I say won\u2019t be too much of a disappointment to you. You haven\u2019t asked yet, but I know that you mean to invite me to join you in that Moria adventure you are always talking about. I am afraid that I have spent enough time crawling in the dark under the Misty Mountains not to wish to do that ever again! But there\u2019s a good bunch of eager lads and lasses here that you might find to your liking. Why, they are just waiting for no more than a nod in their direction from me or from our Grey friend to go off into the blue for mad adventures! Theirs is an age that is more appropriate to that type of business, believe me,  and I have taught them a thing or two. I suspect that Gandalf has too... \nFrom a letter from Bilbo Baggins, Esq. to Balin son of Fundin\nThe One Ring RPG Core Rules (Standard Edition)\n\u201cThis is the Master-ring, the One Ring to rule them all.\u201d\nThe One Ring\u2122 is a roleplaying game based on The Hobbit\u2122 and The Lord of the Rings\u2122, two extraordinary works of fiction by the beloved author and respected academic, John Ronald Reuel Tolkien, published in partnership with Sophisticated Games.\nFirst released in 2011, its award-winning design was hailed as the best attempt at bringing Middle-earth to the gaming table to date, thanks to its thematic rules and painstaking attention to detail. For 10 years, players of the game have traveled far and wide across Middle-earth, adventuring for multiple decades of game time.\nToday, it is time for the game to enter a new era \u2013 this new edition of The One Ring brings players further into the Twilight of the Third Age with a new hardbound volume, presenting:\nA set of updated and streamlined rules, developed thanks to years of players\u2019 feedback and raising the game to the standards of quality that have made Free League so popular.\n A new setting to experience \u2013 the Lone-lands of Eriador in the year is 2965 of the Third Age. This is a vast land that once saw the glory of the North Kingdom of the D\u00fanedain.\n A complete visual redesign of art and graphics, offering a view of Middle-earth that is fresh and familiar at the same time.\nSample Spreads (Work in Progress)\nTo celebrate the 10th anniversary of The One Ring RPG, we're delighted to offer an unique Collector\u2019s Edition of the game. This deluxe volume is bound in faux leather with gold foil-stamped adornments and Tengwar script. The Collector's Edition is exclusive to this Kickstarter and will never be printed again.\nThe Exclusive Collector's Edition, With Faux Leather Covers and Gold Foil Script\n\n\u201cThe Enemy still lacks one thing to give him strength and knowledge to beat down all resistance, break the last defences, and cover all the lands in a second darkness. He lacks the One Ring.\u201d\nThe One Ring is set in the Twilight of the Third Age, a time-frame comprising the events narrated in The Hobbit\u2122 and the start of The Lord of the Rings\u2122. Encompassing more than six decades, this period is ushered in when Bilbo the Hobbit finds the Ruling Ring, and culminates with the war fought by the Free Peoples against the Dark Lord Sauron, and the destruction of the Ring.\nThe year is 2965 of the Third Age, and the players create a Company of heroes, Hobbits, Dwarves, Elves and Men seeking adventure in the Lone-lands of Eriador. It is a desolate country, a vast land that once saw the glory of the North Kingdom of the D\u00fanedain, the Men of the West. Here, many wars were fought, and countless ruins dot its landscape. Shadows move along its paths, and not all of them belong to the living. It is here that the One Ring lies, a seed of the past that will one day lead the world to open war against the returning Shadow.\nThis edition of The One Ring moves the focus of the game to the lands of Old Arnor, with a full description of the town of Bree and the surrounding areas, including famous locales like Weathertop, Fornost and Annuminas, providing the players with a new starting point for their adventures.\nThe Enemy is moving, and smoke issues once more from Mount Doom, in the land of Mordor...\nArt by Alvaro Tapia\n\u201c\u2026 you have been chosen, and you must therefore use such strength and heart and wits as you have.\u201d\nIn The One Ring, players create individuals who led an ordinary life until something made them realize that they were simply pretending that shadows weren\u2019t growing nearer and nearer every year. They are not soldiers or mercenaries, nor are they subtle Wizards trying to weave the threads spun by fate: they are adventurous souls representing the various Free Peoples opposing the return of the Shadow.\nThe core gameplay of The One Ring revolves around two alternate phases \u2014 the Adventuring Phase and the Fellowship Phase. This structure follows the deeds of the players not only geographically, as they explore the land in pursuit of their goals, but also chronologically, as time passes and the Twilight of the Third Age enfolds.\nThe game mechanics have been created from the ground up to match the source material and emulate the action as depicted in The Lord of the Rings\u2122 and The Hobbit\u2122. They feature a set of custom dice, but the game can also be played using a standard set including a 12-sided die and at least six 6-sided dice. The accessibility and elegance of the system fits in perfectly with other games by Free League. \nThis new edition of the game further reinforces the connection between its mechanics and the stories that inspired them. The rules for things like hero creation or the use of Hope have been tweaked to make the game run smoothly without sacrificing their faithfulness to the sources, while those for Journeys and Councils, for example, have been completely redesigned. New rules, like those for Magical die results, have been added to evoke elements that are vital to the theme of the game, like the subtle magic of Middle-earth.\nThe new edition will be compatible with modules for the first edition, requiring only minor tweaking.\nArt by Martin Grip\nCreated for the first time for this edition of the game, the Starter Set contains everything you need to start playing, and more! Focused on the Shire, this set allows for new players to enter the world of Middle-earth from the land of the Hobbits, where all the stories began. A number of pre-generated characters allow players to take the road to adventure in no time. The boxed set, mainly written by seasoned RPG writer James Spahn, includes:\n Condensed rules, including everything you need to start playing in Middle-earth.\nAn adventure compendium, presenting a number of adventures to be played using the pre-generated characters contained in the box.\nPre-generated characters of esteemed Hobbits like Drogo Baggins, Paladin Took, Primula Brandybuck or Lobelia Baggins, and more.\nAs we have exceeded our base funding goal, we will more content to the boxed set as stretch goals. You can read more about these under Stretch Goals, below. A summary:\nA huge full-color map (format format 720 x 558 mm) of the Shire and Eriador, created by Francesco Mattioli.\nSix square Stance Cards, used to keep track of the fighting stance of characters in combat\nA set of engraved custom dice, with six D6 Success Dice and two D12 Feat Dice. \nApproximately 30 Item Cards for weapons, shield and armor, all beautifully illustrated.\nA full compendium of the Shire, detailing the land of the Hobbits for The One Ring for the first time.\nTHE ONE RING\u2122 Starter Set (Not Final Design)\nWe know that many of you have been enjoying roleplaying in Middle-earth using the fifth edition ruleset in the Adventures in Middle-Earth. We are working on a new edition for the 5E rules as well \u2013 but it is not part of this Kickstarter. More information about this will follow in the months to come.\nWe love friendly local gaming stores all over the world and want to forge an even closer relationship with you.

We have started with something small with the hope that our effort allows us to grow up further.\nWe have been participating in projects like this one all over the years and that\u2019s why we feel that we have created a solid project. So the risks are small even though they are always there.\n\nWe produce everything in Europa: the miniatures and the dices in Spain and the paperboard in Poland. We work with very veteran and solvent companies. \n\nWe\u2019ll ship a small package. We have not included any add-on that could bring difficulties to the delivery of the package due to size or weight. This way we can reduce risks and costs.\n\nWe have been extremely realistic with all our prices. We are not cheating you: everything has a suitable price. A lot of projects fail because of the wrong calculated marges, there are a lot of examples. That won\u2019t happen to us.\n\nThank you very much for your trust in us.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u20ac1 or more", "title": "Viewer", "descp": "Get notified when we open the access to the pledge manager.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2021"}], "stat": ["104 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac65 or more", "title": "Coach", "descp": "Takkure Core Box, including all applicable unlocked Stretch Goals.\nThis pledge does not include shipping.

This time, we present Reckless Deck: PSYCHE, an 8-category system that takes you on a deep dive into the landscape of your character\u2019s MIND. \nDesigned to answer the number one request we\u2019ve gotten, PSYCHE gives you an endlessly combinable series of prompts for creating compelling, complex characters for your writing, IP creation, role playing gaming, and narrative art. \n\u2022 Their most burning desires.\n\u2022 The strengths that propel them, and the flaws that undo them.\n \u2022 The deepest secrets they keep hidden away.\n \u2022 The events from their past that shaped them and defined who they would become. \nThe 8 interlocking categories of Reckless Deck: PSYCHE are based on the the most grounded and actionable techniques used by writers and actors, and puts those tools in your hands in a direct, fun, and endlessly re-combinable set.  \n Psyche is separated into two main parts, the CORE and the COMPANIONS. The Core Set gives you the first 4 categories - the universal categories that apply to all characters in fiction, regardless of style, genre, or time period.\nThe Superobjective is the beating heart and the driving force of your character. It is their most essential desire, and the true north that influences all their decisions. Though a character\u2019s objective changes from scene to scene given the circumstances of the plot or the nature of the interaction, their Superobjective is what drives them through the entire arc of their story. They may not even be aware of what it is, but you, as the creator, can use it as the lighthouse that allows you to understand your character at their very core.\nThe Superobjectives are divided into 4 essential \u201csuits\u201d based on fundamental human needs: Love, Power, Strength, and Knowledge/Spirituality. But within each suit, there is a myriad of different expressions of that need - which is why the Superobjectives cards also have a specific expression. For example: Within the LOVE suit, the desire for love can manifest in many different ways. \nPSYCHE gives you 40 different cards that explore character Superobjectives.\nYour characters Strengths are the qualities they lean on to propel themselves through their story. They are the inherently positive ways they might think, perceive, or behave that are beneficial to either themselves or to others. Each Strengths card gives you a positive quality, and a brief description of what that quality might look like.\nincluded in the Core Set\nNobody\u2019s perfect. Your character\u2019s Flaws are the faults or weaknesses that plague them as they move through the world of the story. They are the imperfections or repetitively self sabotaging aspects of their personality that cause them problems and limit (or totally subvert) their potential successes. Each Flaws card gives you a negative aspect of your character, and a brief description of how it may manifest.\nGIVEN CIRCUMSTANCES - These are the physical and environmental conditions of your character\u2019s present situation. The 40 Given Circumstances cards might give you:\none of many possible phobias or addictions\nThe state of their family relationships or financial situation\npast or current illnesses or injuries\none of many possible physical or mental skills\n\n The remaining 4 categories of Psyche are context-specific. Meaning, their content is crafted to suit the genre of the story, or world your character lives in. They come in sets of interchangeable, 160 card COMPANION DECKS. Companions can be swapped out and plugged in individually, or, in true Reckless Deck fashion, mixed together and mashed up for some explosive, genre-bending results. The Core Reckless Deck: PSYCHE set comes with the CONTEMPORARY Companion Deck, so all 8 categories are included. All of the other genres will open up in the stretch goals, so stay tuned for that! The Companion Decks (so far) are:\nContemporary (Included with the base PSYCHE set)\nEpic Fantasy\nUrban Fantasy\nSteampunk & Victorian\nLovecraftian & Noir\nHorror\nEspionage\nCyberpunk\nEach Companion Deck contains these 4 categories:\nincluded in the Core Set\nWhat does your character do for a living? The OCCUPATIONS category reveals a lot about the nature of your character - and the very nature of the kind of story you\u2019re about to tell. A great deal can be determined by whatever profession, vocation, or gig your character engages in. Each Companion Deck comes with 40 possible professions specific to that world or genre.\nexamples from other Companion Decks\nincluded in the Core Set\nEverybody has a SECRET of some kind or another. Whether due to shame, necessity, their future potential as a deadly weapon, or just the sheer deliciousness of it all, these are the things your character is keeping to themselves. Each Companion Deck comes with 40 genre or world-specific character secrets.\nexamples from other Companion Decks\nincluded in the Core Set\n\u201cWhat happened to you to make you this way?\u201d FORMATIVE EVENTS explores events from your characters past that had an outsized influence on the person they\u2019ve become. Whether a shocking moment of trauma, a sustained period of deprivation or abuse, a magical, Dickensian moment that reversed their fortunes, or a positive influence that made all the difference, each Companion Deck gives you 40 context-specific, world-rocking blasts from (their) past that shaped your character\u2019s skills, neuroses, compulsions, and worldview.\nexamples from other Companion Decks\nincluded in the Core Set\nThis is the moment where character meets story. PSYCHE\u2019S last category provides the narrative spark that puts your character on their heroes' journey. The INCITING INCIDENT is your character\u2019s call to action. Whether it's a mild provocation or a life-wrecking cataclysm, this is the disruption in their life's status quo that forces them into motion. Each Companion Deck gives you 40 genre specific Inciting Incidents to launch your character into their narrative.\nexamples from other Companion Decks\n Now, let's put the pieces together!\nHere's a special video clip demonstrating another character creation - this time, utilizing the Epic Fantasy Companion Deck, which was the first stretch goal we unlocked!\nPLAY\n\nart by Vanessa Lemen. Cover design not final\nTo showcase-slash-celebrate what a powerful character-generating tool PSYCHE can be, we're publishing a deluxe paperback anthology of short stories written using the PSYCHE  system. Written by a variety of contributors, their stories will take us on a wild ride through style and genre. The common thread connecting them all will be the uniqueness of the different concepts, and the clarity creative voice that's possible when a pool of writers draw from the same prompts for source material. The Short Story Anthology is available as one of our Kickstarter rewards. To find out how to get your story in the anthology, look here.\nthe 2017 Good & Evil Coin\nThe Good & Evil Coin was the surprise hit of our 2017 campaign. The number of people who remarked on it during the many unboxing videos posted on Instagram and YouTube was stunning (and very gratifying). This time, we're doing a sequel coin - the Protagonist/Antagonist Coin! The coin will measure 1.5\" in diameter, and weigh a full ounce. As with the Good & Evil Coin, both sides will have original designs by me. \nThough I'm still working out some of the details, this coin will definitely have a \"DUNE-meets-THREE MUSKETEERS-meets-VAMPIRE MASQUERADE\" kind of aesthetic. This time though, it will be available in a variety of colors: antiqued gold, antiqued silver, or antiqued copper. I'll be keeping you all apprised of the design progress in project updates - and I'm happy to hear your input about what versions you like best!\nAnd if you're a fan of these custom coins, stay tuned for the stretch goals, where we have the potential to unlock an entire series of genre-themed coins. \n\n\nBelow is a graphic showing all our other rewards, and their corresponding dollar amount to add on to your pledge. Any item can be added on. This includes the Protagonist/Antagonist Coin, the Short Story Anthology, Multiple copies of the Psyche Core Set, or even multiples of the Passport Tier. There are two ways to add on:\n1. Add the dollar amount that corresponds to the total of all your desired add ons to your pledge total. In the Backerkit Pledge Manager at the end of the campaign, you will have a credit to use for selecting your add ons.\n2. Wait until Backerkit to do your adding on. Each of these rewards, and each stretch goal (including Companion Decks) we open over the course of the campaign will be available as individual add ons in Backerkit. (The price for the Passport Tier will be going up after the campaign reaches 100K, so if you think you'll want multiples of this, best to get it early.) \nNote: The advantage of adding the funds for your add ons to your pledge immediately in Kickstarter is that it drives the campaign's total, further increasing the likelihood we'll get to the stretch goals you want. \n\nI\u2019ve been both a storyboard artist for film, TV, and commercial production and sci fi/fantasy illustrator and for the past 10 years. But before that, I was a professional actor in New York, and received my MFA in acting from the A.R.T. Institute at Harvard University. I\u2019ve had one foot in the acting world and the other in illustration for my entire adult life. I've trained as a visual artist since childhood - at Syracuse University, RISD, SVA, and the SmartSchool and IMC, but as it happens, both of my degrees are in theater. My Master\u2019s degree training at A.R.T. was comprehensive and intense. We were taught to claim a lot of agency in the storytelling - to be a constant source of new ideas for the director to work with, and to constantly strive to portray a character that was active and forward-moving in every moment. This sense of personalization, of continuing to turn aspects of the story around and around in your mind until you find the answer that is specific and personally compelling to you is one of the fundamental things I'm hoping PSYCHE can bring to your creative process.\nBut, this project is too large and spans too much territory for this to come from my brain alone!  And so, I've assembled a PSYCHE Illuminati to add their ideas and vision to this project.: \nElle Greco - Urban Fantasy/Romance novelist who just published 2 novels back to back, HEARTBREAK BEAT and LOVE SONG, both part of her LA Rock Star Romance series\nPatrick Hayle - An LA screenwriter\nRich Savage - Master Dungeon Master\n Zuzanna Szadkowski - TV & stage actor; Dorota from the CW series GOSSIP GIRL; THE KNICK, and co-author of a play about LIZZIE BORDEN, coming soon to Off Broadway\nBack the project, and you'll be getting to know each of them in upcoming Project Updates.\nI've asked myself  how this is relevant to the time we\u2019re living in right now. There\u2019s no way to do a project like this at this time and not first stop and ask what value this adds. The answer is: we\u2019re missing a lot of what we used to know as normal right now: School. Work. Restaurants & bars. Sports. Theater. A reason to get up and put on real clothes. How about what feels like a normal human distance between family and good friends? And for those of us who travel in nerdier spheres, CONS! Cons of every flavor and stripe are happening virtually, or not at all. (And also game nights. Sigh.)  So what are we left with? Time. A lot of isolation. And, our own creativity. I believe that, given that there\u2019s so much else we can\u2019t do, creating a tool that unlocks the characters & stories inside us will help us all make the most of this time we\u2019re unwillingly gifted with, and create an avenue for countless new stories, role playing game adventures, and graphic novels to come to life. \n Reckless Deck has come a long way since our last Kickstarter. Thanks to backers like you, we funded in under 24 hours, opened every stretch goal last time around, and nearly doubled our money in the Backerkit survey & pre-order stage. As a result, we produced a full line of decks, expansions, and accessories. After fulfillment, we went on to get Reckless Deck placed in iconic retail locations like Powell's Books in Portland, Oregon, and The New Museum of Contemporary Art and Forbidden Planet in New York City. It's also been adopted as a teaching tool by some of the best art schools in the US, like Rhode Island School of Design, Savannah College of Art & Design, and Maryland Institute College of Art. I've had the chance to lecture at and present Reckless Deck to both the Artistacon Convention in Philedelphia and at the Ex Libris Bookstore (campus store to SCAD in Savannah), and will be hosting an online monthly Character Design Sketch Night as part of the IX 2020 virtual convention starting in October.\nPowell's Books, Portland, OR\nForbidden Planet, Union Square, New York City\nThe\"Try Me\" station for Reckless Deck at Ex Libris Bookstore, the campus bookstore at Savannah College of Art & Design\nReckless Deck creator Clark Huggins presenting to students & faculty at Savannah College of Art & Design\n\n\n We are proud to be able to offer Friendly Shipping to select regions. \nYes, we have a pledge manager for this campaign! We used Backerkit on the 2017 Reckless Deck Kickstarter, and they were invaluable. Shipping for all will be calculated at the end of the campaign, in Backerkit. You do not need to add shipping funds to your Kickstarter pledge. Backerkit's survey platform allows you to add on any items from the campaign you wish, and calculates your shipping based on your total order.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nDo I think there are \"risks\" as in, \"this project may fall apart, or take 6 years to follow through, or never actually get produced at all?\" No, I absolutely don't - and I think we've proved that, with the successful production and fulfillment of every reward from our 2017 Kickstarter. The biggest challenge at this moment should be obvious: how COVID-19 will affect the shipping and fulfillment timeline. I've had several conversations with our new printer, Shuffled Ink, about this, and they've assured me that although there have been slight delays at certain times or in certain areas, things are still moving along relatively reliably. \n\nI've addressed some of the \"challenge areas\" from the 2017 Kickstarter. \n\n\u2022 The first we've touched on - timeline. This time, I've I've made sure to build in a much more comfortable & realistic production timeline, which will allow us the time to address all the details of each reward item. \n\n\u2022 The second is, we've upgraded to a new printer: Shuffled Ink. Their foiling & gloss capabilities, color accuracy, and customer service are far superior to our previous printer. \n\n\u2022 This time, I will be using a professional fulfillment service that will get orders shipped worldwide in a much timelier fashion that doing fulfillment myself.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 11 or more", "title": "The Protagonist/Antagonist Coin", "descp": "The sequel to our extremely popular Good & Evil Coin from our 2017 Kickstarter!

You can be on the move with your gaming battlefield surface and city terrain. Go where you please, store it where you want, carry it on your back, take it in your car, public transport, to your friends or a tournament and PLAY WELL ANYWHERE.\nThe complete portable battlefield for your wargames. Fully modular, mousepad game mat with a resin, polyurethane modular terrain system (unpainted or fully painted) and game essential accessories.  Everything is a handmade design with 3D details and compatible with 28-32 mm games scale models. The whole set can be packed into a designer waterproof backpack with laser-cut details for quick, easy, and safe transport of your new setup.\n We believe that our common hobby \u2013 miniature wargaming \u2013 is a great way of spending free time, developing strategic thinking, and, most importantly, making new friends. Let\u2019s remember, though, that apart from beautifully painted minis, models, and whole armies, the models of terrains and battlefields are equally important. They make your wargaming experience richer, more immersive, and exciting. Also, terrain models add greater strategic depth to your scenarios and esthetic value. The last two are often overlooked in our hobby!\n Up till now, moving tabletop terrain around to the place where we want to play has been problematic, to say the least, if we don\u2019t have a game store or a gaming club in our city. Also, because of the global pandemic, we can\u2019t even go to our favorite stores, clubs, or hobby rooms. If you don\u2019t have an estate car, visiting a friend for a gaming night or a trip to a tournament can become an arduous process. Another thing is that often we don\u2019t have enough room to store our terrains at home. We know that not everyone can have a dedicated space for wargaming let alone a whole room. We bet you dream of one \u2013 we also do!\n Your pain is our pain too, so we\u2019ve decided to solve these problems. We\u2019ve designed and developed a modular game mat, a terrain system, and a carry-it-all backpack. From now on, you can easily carry your beautiful terrains and we\u2019re sure nobody will overlook them. Find out yourself, it takes just a few minutes to take out all the elements and set up an epic battlefield. Just grab and go: walk, drive, ride. Travel with your new terrain battlepack by bike, skateboard, car, bus, train, or maybe even on a ship or airplane!\nApart from all the cool features and functions of the backpack shown in the pictures, we\u2019d like to point out that the backpack also has a thick lining, which additionally protects your precious models and other items during transport. The lining also provides additional protection against rain.\n You probably wonder why we claim that this is \u201cthe first game mat of this kind\u201d, why we emphasize every time that this mat is unique? Here, let us explain: each module of the mat had its own prototype and it was hand-made and painted by me, taking care of every inch and every detail. Do you want to learn more? Check the clip below and decide if it\u2019s something up your alley ;)\n Just look how easy it is. Take a felt container out of the backpack, open the boxes, assemble each building wall by wall. Each part is clearly marked so you\u2019ll know what goes with what. After a couple of minutes, your city is ready for battle.\nThis is what everyone likes the most. Here you can check what has been already unlocked and how likely we are to unlock even more! We\u2019ve prepared for you additional color schemes, customization options for your Battlepack backpack  and free scatters for your terrain setup. So let's do it  together!\nSome of you are going to think \u201ccool idea, but it needs more buildings, more scatter, more barricades! The city looks sparse and barren.\u201d If that\u2019s what you think, this place is for you! Here you can check the prices of individual models and sets so you can build or upgrade your dream city. You can also expand the battlefield with additional mat modules or choose an additional one for replacement.\nIf you are interested in expanding your city set with additional elements or you need only individual models, don\u2019t worry \u2013 at this stage, you don\u2019t have to do anything. You don\u2019t have to calculate how much your pledge is going to cost with the add-ons, because once the campaign is over, you\u2019ll get access to the pledge manager. In the pledge manager, you can pick and adjust everything the way you need it to be quickly and hassle-free as well as pay the shipment cost. So, don\u2019t lose your head now ;) Pick one pledge and presto! Instead of wasting time on calculating every single bit, share the Battlepack campaign on social media, and with your help we\u2019ll reach an even greater number of players! Thanks in advance for your help!\n We are a miniature wargame terrain small company based in Cieszyn, Poland.\n Now we design and produce high-quality terrain from our original sci-fi, post-apocalyptic and fantasy worlds. The Bantam Alley, The G\u00e5rdb\u00fbk Shrine and Petrolyard projects were supported by nearly 400 backers on Kickstarter.\n We boast of solid 16-year-old experience in creating handmade terrain projects for individual commissions. During this time, we have made hundreds of successful projects for gamers all around the human sphere.\n Since 2015, we have been in the resin and polyurethane terrain business and we offer unique ideas for wargame, skirmish and RPG gamers. We never cease to satisfy the growing number of the most demanding players. We will be extremely proud if you want to back this idea.\n I won\u2019t go into details how we first found out about Warhammer and wargame minis, because you can read about it on StudioLevel website. Let\u2019s just focus on the Battlepack and the story behind its parts.\n I made my first battlefield board around 2008 and since 2012 I have sculpted around 100 modular boards ordered by individual gamers from around the world. However, we created the first hand-made and printed designs for our second successful Kickstarter campaign \u2013 The G\u00e5rdb\u00fbk Shrine \u2013 three years ago, and the mats have been popular with players up to this day. We wanted to combine all the good sides of sculpted, detailed, and modular designs with the advantages of mousepad mats so appreciated by the players. Let\u2019s not forget that such mats can be manufactured faster and they can be delivered to a larger group of people, because the process eliminates manual work over each and every board.\n When I shipped unique terrains to players,I had to make sure that the models would safely arrive to their owners even if they lived on the other side of the globe. In 2012, I came up with the idea to create buildings whose walls and floors were assembled with the base and with magnets. This idea was so well received that I have manufactured buildings this way ever since but I have upgraded this technique to make it more precise and to add more details. My cities have been successful and the number of players interested in them has been growing. That is why it is time to deliver the cities to a larger audience by manufacturing them with resin. The other parts form a battle-tested system of barricades that can be joined together and other city scatter and scenery. We are constantly testing new materials, resins, foams \u2013 all these to deliver more durable but also lighter models to you.\n The idea behind a similar product is the effect of this year\u2019s coronavirus lockdown that has taken us all by surprise. With one swooping assault on our day-to-day lives, it has cut us off from the places where we used to gather to enjoy our hobby. I thought a lot how to combine the mat, the terrains, and a way to pack them all so we could travel around safely and hassle-free. Finally, I noticed the works of Ms Dorota from PANATO BAGS and their original and stylish backpacks. \nThat was the eureka moment for me: I got the idea to create a backpack for your new terrains and we\u2019ve been working on it since April. After two months, I received the first prototype backpack, which I proudly present to you. However, we\u2019re still developing the design with Dorota, so the final product will be even better :) We\u2019ve already got some feedback how to upgrade the backpack and we can\u2019t wait to see this project through with you!\nAlmost every company and customer has experienced the negative effects of this year\u2019s lockdown on international shipping. Particular services were put on hold or cancelled, which caused huge delays in the delivery of the products bought online. Currently, the majority of delivery companies work normally but due to the pandemic, the prices for international shipping have significantly increased. Nobody likes to pay for the delivery, but unfortunately, there\u2019s nothing we can do about this. Your models need to be safely packaged for the whole, usually long, trip. We are constantly improving our shipment logistics with every project and thanks to our friends\u2019 invaluable advice. Also note that the shipping price covers not only the delivery itself but also storage, packages, sorting and packing, invoicing, insurance, replacement, etc.\nWe\u2019ve prepared several delivery options. We hope that you\u2019ll find one that satisfies your needs and expectations. The more expensive options are faster and the cheaper ones cover shipping by sea \u2013 but they\u2019ll reach their destination, don\u2019t worry. Of course, when the campaign ends, we\u2019ll be monitoring the situation of international delivery with regard to the pandemic. Together we\u2019ll overcome the obstacles and nothing\u2019s gonna stop us!\n First of all, because still we are a small company but we have valuable experience and good professional reputation. We have already invested in creating backpack with accessories, game mat and the majority of the silicone molds needed for castings. Now we need your backing to start and complete the production.\nAs a small company, we don\u2019t have a sufficient budget for full-fledged marketing. Thanks to Kickstarter, though, our campaign can reach players from around the globe. If you think our idea is cool and interesting but you\u2019re not ready to buy our product, you can still share the campaign on social media. Every little bit of exposure helps to make our community bigger: the more the merrier ;) Thanks a lot!\n2020 is completely crazy and unpredictable, and events like the COVID-19 pandemic have shown we can\u2019t take as much for granted as we used to. However, we\u2019ll do all we can to carry on with the project and the campaign stages the way we\u2019ve planned. After all, we have a secret weapon: our rich experience we\u2019ve gained over the years through hard work on our previous Kickstarter campaigns.\n Since our humble beginnings, hundreds of players from around the world have put trust in us. Today, you can join the ranks of our community and become part of our incredible journey.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs of now, we have successfully obtained funds for four Kickstarter projects: NEW Bantam Alley (unpainted resin casts), two The G\u00e5rdb\u00fbk Shrine (fully painted polyurethane terrain series) and Petrolyard (unpainted resin casts)\n\nWe are sure that we will produce your new models. We see no risk in this area. The accumulated knowledge and experience from our previous projects allows us to better organize our work and exclude earlier mistakes. Only the circumstances beyond our control create the risk of delaying the delivery of your rewards.\n\nTo streamline all the formalities, once the campaign is finished, we will use pledge manager.

We will keep the files on our system for at least three months after the first date of issue. The user must ensure that he collects the files within this time frame or risk forfeit. Lovecraft will always try their utmost to ensure that you receive your files and we hope that you enjoy printing them as much as we have enjoyed creating them. If there are any issues please contact support@i-lovecraft.com\n\nBackers must realize that the resolution you obtain on your print is down to the system you use. Our high resolution files will give you almost render quality prints on high end Resin machines, whilst the same files will produce lesser resolution prints on standard FDM printers. At any rate, the files have been previously tested on Resin and FDM printers and have shown satisfactory produce.\n\nWe recommend FDM Prints with at least a 400micron nozzle and 150 micron layer height for terrain. A 100 micron layer height will give you outstanding prints all round.\n\nResin printers should have no problems obtaining excellent resolution and finish, even at 100 micron layer height although 50 micron layer height is recommended for minute sculpt detail clarity. Although miniatures and figurines can be split into smaller parts, large terrain pieces will require a standard 220x220mm print bed, standard for FDM Printers like the 'Ender3'. We do try to restrict the maximum size of models to 180mm sq where possible.\n\nWe supply the user with a design that has been tested on conventional home hobby printers and is proven to print.\n\nAll the models are tested and sliced with 'Cura' software which is freeware and available to all backers for use. We recommend that backers use 'Cura' as it is fully tested with our models and we can offer customer support, if any problems are encountered. We are unable to give customer support for other slicing software and backers use this at their own risk.\n\nAll the files have been checked using Netfab, this means that PrusaSlicer should have no problems slicing these files. Many of the files are also tested using PrusaSlicer.\n\nAll accumulated Grab Bag, Bonus models, also known as Daily Bonus or Free Models are given freely, under no obligation, as is and as a gift and don't form part of the campaign or responsibilities associated with this.\n\nWhen using our digital media, we do not hold ourselves responsible for the production or manufacturing process of the design, this is exclusively up to the user.\n\nUsers may modify models and files at their own risk and only for their own personal use. Modified files are not guaranteed by us and as such, users do this under their own risk and know how.\n\nThe Images shown on the campaign page are just for visualization and although they may come very close, they may not be an exact representation of the final design or printed model, which may vary.\n\nWe reserve the right to alter any of the models shown, at any time, before delivery, with the intent of improving the design, or efficiency of production.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nSomething else\nDigital distribution, no impact to the environment", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u20ac1 or more", "title": "Super Backer and Add-on", "descp": "Help us by contributing and following this project.

It combines the elements of a TCG with a board game, and incorporates the beautiful art and fan favorite characters of Force of Will alongside new skills and strategies!\nSummon your armies to the battleground - customize your deck, protect your Ruler, and battle with Linkers to win the day!\nA basic game starts with:\nFour acrylic standees of your characters (one Ruler/J-Ruler and three Linkers)\nA 20-card deck \nA map\nScore Tracker\nIn order to set up a basic game, two starter decks are required. By backing $60 or more, you will receive at least two decks to get things going! There are five decks to choose from: Fire, Water, Wind, Light or Dark.\nPlayers will start at either end of the map \u2013 the player who goes first chooses which side of the two-sided map will be used, while the other gets to choose the right/left side of the map they want to be on. Linkers begin on the map (starting spots are designated on the Ruler card) while Rulers wait on the score tracker to make their appearance. \nAlternate Souls Map\nOpposite side!\nEach turn, players gain energy called Will, to be used by their armies to move, attack or defend, while the Ruler moves along the Score Tracker:\nOnce the Ruler reaches the \"zero\" end of the Score Tracker, they charge onto the battlefield to join the fray!\nPoints are scored for:\nStepping out 1 step from the opponent's end of the battlefield (opponent loses 1 point)\nMaking the opponent 'deck out' - if you uses all of your cards and needs to draw but can't without shuffling, it's a 'deck out' and you lose 1 point\nDefeating an opponent's J-ruler and sending them back to the Score Tracker (2 points)\nEach player start the game with 2 points. The first player to bring their opponent to zero is victorious! \n\nIn the full game, you will choose 5 Linkers and 1 Ruler to play with. Each Linker comes with 1 stat card and 5 Action cards, and each Ruler will come with 4 Action cards, so you have a total of 29 action cards. You will choose TWENTY of those cards to play with for this match, and set the 9 other cards aside. You will play the match with a deck of 20 total action cards, setting one of each Linker up on the board in the spaces designated by your Ruler.  Just like in the basic game, the Ruler will then go on the score tracker, based on the cost of that Ruler, and will enter the game as a J-Ruler once the game has passed that many rounds. Scoring will continue the same.\nWe have designed the game this way to make it very easy to learn. Once you play the full game with 6 characters each, you will find there is so much strategy behind the game, you will want to play again and again to fine tune your skills and become the champion of Alternate Souls!\nThere are a couple of ways to check out a more in-depth look at gameplay:\nClick the image to download a PDF of the rules!\nCan't wait? Here's a printable demo version you can play with! Try it out today!\nClick here for a free printable Alternate Souls demo deck! \n Click here to download Map1! \n Click here to download Map2!  \n We've received many helpful questions from the last Kickstarter and wanted to help clarify our design philosophy! \nWhy did we make this game?:\nWe wanted to create a game that brought all the different characters of Force of Will together. Force of Will has a vast expanse of sets and story separating all the characters, we wanted to offer a game that gathered them in one big epic battle arena. We chose to use acrylic set pieces in order to have a game that is interactable to distinguish ourselves more from the less interactive digital games that are abound these days.\nHow was the game designed?:\nWe had chess in mind as we designed, a game that is inherently simple but full of depth. We want our game to be just as easy to start but difficult to master in order to give players maximum enjoyment. The setting was chosen because we wanted to bring all kinds of different characters together under one banner and have them fight it out!\nThe game rules are simple, but a nearly limitless amount of combinations can be made from the cards and pieces. Through two Starter Decks alone, you can enjoy a \u201cmini game\u201d with a friend to learn the game. Once you are familiar with the rules, add some Booster Pack characters and perfect your deck!\nWe have extensively fine-tuned the game to be balanced between overly difficult and too simple, but are dedicated to monitoring strength levels and adjusting for the next set.\nWhen you back at this pledge level you get to choose 2 of the 5 Alternate Souls starter decks. This is everything you need to play the duel with a friend, and is an intro to this great new Arena Card Game.\nThe Linker pledge level gives you all five starter decks AND five Kickstarter Exclusive alternate art standees.  These are alternate art versions of the J-Rulers that come in the starter decks.\nThe Ruler pledge level gives you all 5 starters AND one booster box of the 1st booster set! That is a total of 25 packs that you will get. Additionally, you will get the alternate art Kickstarter Exclusive standees that come in the Linker pledge level, AND a neoprene playmat of your choice of map for Alternate Souls! But that's not all! There are 5 more J-Rulers that you can find in the booster packs, and we are going to make alternate art versions of those as well - and include those in the rewards for this pledge level. That's TEN Kickstarter Exclusive promotional standees that come in this pledge level!\nThis is the big one! Included in the J-Ruler pledge level is a one-of-a-kind special mega metal plate card for each J-Ruler. These are super amazing and there's no other way to say it - they are absolutely unique. We are only making one of each of these and they will NOT be reproduced. These are only for backers of this Kickstarter campaign! Not only that, but you will of course you get all of the rewards from the Ruler pledge level and you will also receive both map playmats! You will also earn the right to have your name on the starter deck of the matching ruler and the booster box display!\n That's right - there's only one of each of these gold metal plates being created. Once a tier is pledged for, it's no longer available! Take a look at the image below to see if your J-Ruler is still available!\nAlternate Art Plates!\n\nThese gorgeous metal plates are two-sided, featuring the art of the starter Rulers and booster ruler and measure 126x178mm - about 5x7 inches, the size of an iPad mini! Here's one, compared to the Ruler's standard-sized card!\nIf that screengrab doesn't do it justice - take a look at the video!\nPLAY\n\nRetailers, we know you would love to get involved with this as well! This pledge level will require us to check your retailer status, but after it is confirmed we will send the product! The Retailer pledge level includes the following:\nFive Starter Deck Displays - 25 Starter Decks Total (5 of each attribute)\nFive Booster Pack Displays - 125 Booster Packs Total\nFive Organized Play Prize Kit - 25 Promos Total (5 Variants)\nFifty Exclusive Alternate Art Standees (5 of each 10 Variants)\nBoth Setup Playmats\nBacking at this pledge level will give you access to the Kickstarter Exclusive standees to make available to your customers in your store. This is a one time offering and the only way to receive these alternate art promotional standees is by backing this Kickstarter campaign. We will be making more great foil cards and promotional items available to stores as well, and we can't wait to work with you to promote Alternate Souls through your store! Last but not least, we are also hoping to introduce stores as special founder partners on our website, so players can easily find locations to play!\nA starter deck includes 3 linkers with 6 cards each and 1 ruler with 5 cards, for a total of 23 cards. Additionally, you will get a 2-sided map to play the game on. \nBooster packs contain one character standee and six cards for that character.\nBooster boxes will contain 25 booster packs. Each booster box will guarantee a complete booster set, making collecting a set a breeze! Don't worry, shop owners will be still be able to sell individual packs!\nThe art book is approximately 8x11\" with a soft cover and 72 full-color pages! We will be sharing some of the art available during the campaign, but trust us, it's gorgeous!\nThese two playmats are the rubber version of the A/B-sided paper map that you will receive in a starter deck. You can get one, or both! Ruler tier backers will be able to choose which map they'd like, and the J-Ruler pledge tier contains both! Furthermore, we have decided to add character arts to the other side of each one of these mats, to be voted on by YOU the supporters! Keep an eye out for further updates!\nThere are two separate Kickstarter Exclusive alternate art promo standee sets that will be available as part of this campaign. Booster set #1 will include alternate art versions of the rulers from the starter decks and booster set #2 will include alternate art versions of the rulers from the booster set! These will ONLY be available as part of this campaign and you will all get a chance to vote on which art we will choose for these! Again, these sets will only be available as a part of this Kickstarter campaign, and while you can pledge to get extra sets, you can only do so as a part of this campaign!\nThese card sleeves are going to be amazing! We have 5 different sleeves that we will be producing and each one is based on the alternate art J-rulers from the five starter decks! But there's more! We will be making 5 more sleeves using booster set J/ruler art! We want you, the player, to vote on whether we use the ruler art or J-ruler art for each ruler's sleeve! Just add $6 onto your pledge for each pack of sleeves.  These will be very limited and made to order, so get 'em while they're hot! \nAnd yes, these are standard sized cards sleeves which will fit Alternate Souls cards and all standard sized card games. (not yugioh!)\nLimited edition T-shirts now available! There are a total of ten different designs each featuring different well known characters from throughout the history of Force of Will! Now you can show your Force of Will zeal in style!\nWe also have these amazing silver metal plates available! Let your rulers take to the battlefield in style! These silver plates will only be available as add-ons to the Kickstarter campaign so get them while you can! These silver plates are standard card size.\nBut wait, that's not all! We don't just want to sell you a great game, we want to create a community! It is our final goal to synchronize the Soul System with an Organized Play system that will host tournaments and make new foil promotional cards that will be available later this year, along with amazing prizes, like invitations to come meet the team in Japan, at the Festival of Ultimate Souls! These are all part of our 10,000,000JPY final stretch goal. Together we can make it happen!\n\n\nWhile currently difficult, we would like to host a Festival of Ultimate Souls tournament sometime in Spring of 2021. We would love to see the supporters who helped make our game a reality! To do this, we will implement the Soul System program. The Festival of Ultimate Souls and Soul System program will be implemented only if our Ultimate Stretch Goal is met. Let's make it happen together!\nThe Soul System is a planned concept to keep track of player data through usage of an online app. This app will keep track of updates, product info, upcoming events, and have a QR scanner for scanning QR codes found in starter decks and booster packs. Rewards for QR points will go towards earning special prizes and receiving invitations to the Festival of Ultimate Souls! The Soul System will only be available if our Ultimate Stretch Goal is met!\nWe listen to your feedback. Your input is important to us, and we want to reflect that in our design for following sets.\nThis is only the beginning! With the first release of Alternate Souls, there will be 5 starter decks and the initial offering of booster set #1. We also have two more booster sets already designed - and the plan is to release booster #2 shortly afterwards, followed by booster set #3.  This will be considered the first \"SEASON\" - with our plans to follow by designing the 2nd Season later next year, to be released later in mid-2021.\nPLEASE BE AWARE: We do our best to avoid customs charges and other additional fees, but we cannot control them all. YOU MAY BE CHARGED FOR RECEIVING YOUR PACKAGE. Keep this in mind when making your pledge.\nShipping will be charged through PledgeManager after the Kickstarter campaign ends. \nAfter the campaign has ended, you will be sent an invite to complete a survey to handle your pledged rewards, any additional add-ons, and finally, shipping. For example, if you paid for the 'Start the Battle' tier, you will see that reward waiting for you on PledgeManager. From there, you can add any optional add-ons like sleeves, starter decks, booster packs, and more! Finally, you can move to finalizing your backing by filling out your address and paying the shipping. \nIf you miss the campaign, you can still pre-order with the Pre-Order button which will appear at the top of this page after the campaign closes. Backers can make changes at any time while Pledgemanager is open. It will remain open for a week or two before fulfillment. That being said, be sure to complete your pledge as soon as possible! Incomplete pledges (missing addresses, incorrect payments, etc.) will be held until they are complete, and we do not want you to wait any longer than you have to your for goodies!\nPlease note that we may have to lock certain items or Pledge Levels closer to fulfillment if these items are reaching the maximum quantity ordered for fulfillment.\n\nA Japan based game studio.

We know that our fans expect regular updates and on-time delivery. We have been taking steps internally to reduce or eliminate delays on fulfillment for future projects in several ways;\n1. Setting more realistic fulfillment deadlines \n2. Dedicating more time to internal reviews of our products, such as team playtesting, and meetings dedicated to reviewing rulebooks, components, etc. Working directly with developers to ensure that our translations and edits correctly transpose mechanics. This has helped us to find errors that set us back in the manufacturing process on previous projects. \n3. For international fulfillment, we have learned a great deal from our previous campaigns, and have altered our shipping plans from our manufacturers to help mitigate the delays our international backers have seen.\nWe are already well into the design process and by the time this campaign closes, the files will be submitted to our manufacturer to begin the proofing process. Playmats and sleeves are laid out and will also be submitted to begin the production process by the end of the campaign.\n\n\nRELEASE SCHEDULE\n\nAs always, we strive to make sure that our Kickstarter backers are the first to receive their copies of games, as we appreciate your support so much! However, due to the logistics scheduling of manufacturers, fulfillment centers and conventions, you may see copies available at a show before you've received your Kickstarter copy. Rest assured if this happens, we are doing everything in our power to make sure your copy is on its way to you as well. Plus - do you really want to find MORE room in your luggage, or just let us ship it to you direct? ;) \n\n\nUPDATE FREQUENCY \n\nWe have made it our goal to post updates at least once every two weeks post-campaign. There are challenges that sometimes prevent us from meeting this goal, but we are doing our best to let our backers know that production is still moving forward. We will have plenty of exciting updates to share with you post-campaign. \n\n\n REFUND POLICY \n\nAfter the campaign we offer a no questions asked refund minus the Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we cannot recover). \nOnce the Pledgemanager has been closed (typically a week or two before fulfillment begins), we do not offer a refund. If we fail to fulfill your game you are entitled to a full refund, including fees. \nAll refunds may be processed via PayPal or the payment reversed through Stripe to your credit card at our discretion. \nThank you for your support!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a5100 or more", "title": "Standard Bearer", "descp": "Get access to the Pledgemanager!\nINCLUDES:\nAccess to the Pledgemanager", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2020"}], "stat": ["50 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a56,300 or more", "title": "Start the Battle", "descp": "Get what you need to get your feet wet!

This place is renowned for the quality of its installation and considered as one of the best jazz studio in Europe. To preserve the quality of the piano sound, we will also operate a specific remastering for the vinyl format.\nThe arrangers are working hard at the moment to finalize the arrangements, so we are unable to provide the exact tracks length yet. Please note arranged tracks length may be different from the original tracks. Further details will be announced soon.\nAcross the Worlds will be a new step for Way\u00f4 Records: a new 50-note mechanical movement instead of 30, for a better reproduction of the original music, performing Radical Dreamers in a two-part melody!

Check updates for details\nLike most ideas, this one started over some beers and tacos on a Tuesday. After some great conversation, we began to exchange some \u201ccrazy\u201d ideas we had. The one that stopped us all in our tracks was the DropTop. We loved our hobbies and primarily tabletop gaming. As a professional artist, my favorite part was painting minis. I enjoyed the scenes and imagination you could explore as well as the technical skill involved in painting miniatures. When I first began my journey into painting these tiny 3D coloring books, I spent a lot of time and money trying out every brand of paint.\nThe DropTop \"Squeeze\" in action.\nThe most efficient way to use your Citadel\u00ae paints\nI found that certain brands excelled in different tones, but one was consistent throughout. These model paints were my favorite across the board. (With the White requiring a little work). I loved the vibrant colors and amazing metallics, and for those people following the paint system for their minis, they are fantastic. As I began to fall in love with the paints, I hit a crossroads. For as much as I loved the colors, the pots they lived in were challenging. From the messy hands to the dreaded \u201cshade spill,\u201d I went on a hunt for an answer. Hours of googling and all I found was time consuming and wasteful solutions. After several prototypes and many ideas, the DropTop finally came to life, and what a surprise it was. Not only did it solve the main challenges of working with the pots and saving your paint, but it also led to all-new ways to use the paints. From directly applying shades to terrain and bases to using the colors to go straight into the airbrush, an elevated way to enjoy our hobby was born.\nYou can drop paint directly into your airbrush\nWe have invested our time and money to bring to life a polished working prototype.

This includes injection mold modeling, artwork, layout for print, playtesting, and more. We've created an exciting list of stretch goals that will not compromise cost or delivery time.\n\nWe've also partnered with world-renowned tabletop game manufacturer Panda Game Manufacturing, who have brought you award-winning games like ROOT, Wingspan, and Pandemic. As fans of the project themselves, Panda reached out to us directly and we have worked together to make sure Necromolds will be a high quality, unique game that you won't hesitate to bring out at game night!\n\nLogistics, shipping, and fulfillment will be handled by Quartermaster Logistics, who have worked hard to offer our backers the best shipping prices possible. QML has been trusted and recommended by many of the most successful board game campaigns on Kickstarter, and they are another company we're proud to be working with.\n\nSpeaking personally... there may always be unforeseen delays and I can only promise to be transparent and honest with all backers. Necromolds is a very unique game with unique manufacturing challenges. That uniqueness is why it is so fun to play, and also why our pre-campaign work has been so thorough.

Based on the Root: A Game of Woodland Might & Right board game and officially licensed by Leder Games, Root: The TTRPG brings the tales of the Woodland to your RPG table!\nIn Root, you play vagabonds, outcasts from the normal society of the woodlands who have come to live in the spaces between, whether that's in the forests themselves or on the fringes of society. You are competent and skilled\u2014you have to be to survive as vagabonds\u2014and you aren\u2019t tied down to any particular place or faction. You might be a badger arbiter, serving many sides in resolving conflicts and defending their interests. You might be a cat scoundrel, sliding on your mask before you sneak out into the darkness to cause mischief and mayhem. You might be a wolf ranger, at home in the wilds and the untamed places of the woodland. \nRoot is based on the Powered by the Apocalypse system used by tabletop RPGs like Apocalypse World, Dungeon World, and many of Magpie Games\u2019s own games like Masks: A New Generation, Urban Shadows, and Zombie World. It uses the core framework of that system and provides a strong, simple way to tell your own stories of adventure in the woodland. You\u2019ll create a character using one of several vagabond archetypes, and then you\u2019ll take action, rolling two six-sided dice to resolve the outcomes of desperate situations.\nRoot creates stories like those you\u2019d find in Redwall, Watership Down, Mouse Guard, The Warriors, and The Guardians of Ga\u2019Hoole.\nThe Woodland is, first and foremost, a deep forest. It hides dark deeds, ancient ruins, and dangerous creatures. The land is not tame\u2014the trees and those who live in them are not safe.\nThe closest a denizen will come to safety in the Woodland are the confines of the clearings, areas either natural or paw-made where the trees thinned out and the denizens of the Woodland built lives. They set up homes and shops and forges, and they found safety in each other\u2019s company.\nOf course, it took no time at all for others to try to take power over these clearings. The Eyrie Dynasties were the first, and oldest\u2014the birds built their homes in the trees above the rest of the denizens, and soon enough believed themselves to be above those denizens in power and status, too. The Eyrie took control of clearing after clearing, until it was the reigning institution in all of the Woodland.\nBut the Eyrie's nobles and petty tyrants squabbled with each other over control and rulership. Until eventually, in the Grand Civil War (only \"Grand\" because it's the most recent), the Eyrie Dynasties tore themselves apart. They were left without enough support, armies, or resources to hold control over much of anything at all. And for a time, the Woodland denizens took charge of their own clearings.\nUntil the cats arrived. \n\nArmies from the far away Feline Empire swept into the now uncontrolled and undefended Woodland. Some denizens of the Woodland fought back, but the invaders were well-trained, well-equipped, and too much for any civilian militia to turn back. The valuable resources of the Woodland would feed the bellies of the Feline Empire. Soon enough, the Marquise de Cat, dispatched by the Empire\u2019s bureaucratic overlords, arrived to take control of the new colony, and the Woodland denizens found themselves under the paw of a new aristocracy.\nAs the cats were consolidating their rule and establishing new industrial buildings to tap the Woodland\u2019s resources, the newly reunited and resurgent Eyrie Dynasties returned to the Woodland, seizing power from the Marquise\u2019s forces to reestablish their hegemonic ascendancy. They rebuilt roosts in the treetops of the Woodland clearings, and opened up full war against the Marquise\u2019s soldiers.\nIn the midst of the blooming conflict, the denizens of the Woodland began sharing secrets and new words in the shadows. Foxes began stockpiling weapons, and mice began stealing communications between officers on all sides of the war. Meetings in root cellars called to a war for freedom, and the fires of rebellion began to smolder. The name of \u201cthe Woodland Alliance\u201d was whispered across the clearings.\n\nThe vagabonds have been a part of the Woodland for as long as anyone can remember. Outsiders and outcasts, criminals and ideologues, exiles and mercenaries\u2014those who didn\u2019t fit into the quieter lives of the clearings, who were hardy enough to survive in the spaces the other denizens avoided. Some dwelt in the forests themselves, completely eschewing the taboos against living in those most dangerous of places.\nIn times of peace, the vagabonds did what others would not, for a price of course. In times of war, the vagabonds found ample opportunity to fill their purses, from scavenging to sellsword work to straight-up thievery. In all cases, they would do what it took to survive, each one finding their own niche of safety and damn the rest.\nBut now, in the midst of this great war that threatens the whole of the Woodland, even the normally solitary vagabonds are finding it more and more difficult to survive by their lonesome. They are banding together, protecting each other, and forming into groups potent enough that even the great powers of the Eyrie and the Marquisate are taking notice...\nThe thick woods of the Woodland keep the denizens contained to the pathways and the clearings. To venture out beyond that safety is to risk running afoul of bandits, foul weather and rough terrain, and terrible things like bears. Fortunately, those paths between clearings are well-worn and patrolled by merchants and armed forces.\nThe clearings play home to many, many different kinds of denizen, from wolves to badgers to squirrels to opossums. But the primary inhabitants of the Woodland are the birds, foxes, mice, and rabbits. The birds spread themselves out among all the clearings, but most clearings are dominated by a majority of one kind of denizen. \n\nSome clearings will be open and friendly to any kind of Woodland denizen, from those who dominate their clearing to those who are from far away; other clearings will fear any strangers who come by.\nAs vagabonds, you can navigate the Woodland both on its paths, and by venturing into its forests, braving the dangers that no others will face.\nIn Root, you will travel from clearing to clearing, and you will take on jobs and missions from diverse sources, and in so doing you will reshape the Woodland as you change the course of the war between those who would rule it.\nTo do all that, the game uses the Powered by the Apocalypse framework to resolve interesting moments of uncertainty. The game has a set of moves, bits of mechanics that by and large say: \u201cWhen you do [x], [y] happens.\u201d Each move trigger\u2014the \u201cWhen you do [x]\u201d part\u2014is designed to help point at moments of uncertainty, when neither the players nor the GM know exactly what happens next. Some examples of such moments include:\nWhen you swing your sword at a towering buzzard Eyrie soldier.\nWhen you try to sneak past a group of bandits to plunder their secret stash.\nWhen you plead with the rabbit mayor to evacuate her clearing in advance of a major battle.\nWhen you try to trick a Marquisate guard post into giving you the food and supplies you desperately need.\nAnd so on. When you trigger a move\u2014when you perform the action described in the move\u2019s trigger\u2014then the rest of the move kicks into effect, most of the time requiring some kind of die roll. You\u2019ll roll 2d6 (two six-sided dice) and add in one of your stats to find out what happens.\nEvery vagabond has five stats:\nEach one is ranked between -2 and +3. You\u2019ll add your stat to some rolls when you trigger certain moves. For example, when you clash sword-to-sword with a foe, you\u2019ll roll 2d6 + Might.\nOn most moves, if you get a 10 or higher (10+), things will go your way! If you get a 7-9, you\u2019ll get what you were after, but usually with some cost or complication. If you get a 6 or lower, that\u2019s called a miss, and the GM gets to tell you what happens next\u2014and you can bet your tail it won\u2019t be good.\nThe Root RPG will have basic moves for all of the different common activities that the vagabonds are likely to get up to, along with special moves for traveling and battle.\nBeyond those basic mechanics, the Root TTRPG features a slew of specific and carefully designed systems for some of the important, unique elements of the Woodland.\nThe Woodland is a big place with many different clearings. The paths between the clearings are safer than the woods themselves, but they\u2019re certainly far from safe. And even though the vagabonds are brave enough to travel the width and breadth of the Woodland, it\u2019s not any safer for them than for anyone else. It might even be more dangerous.\nYour adventures across the Woodland will take you from clearing to clearing, using the paths or slipping through the forests in ways that only the vagabonds can. Every clearing has its own problems, after all, and that means every clearing is a bed of lucrative opportunities for enterprising vagabonds like yourselves. \nTo handle all that travel, the Root RPG features a set of moves designed to allow the vagabonds to move between clearings with ease at a player level, but with interesting complications and concerns at a character level. Will the vagabonds sacrifice their exhaustion to travel more safely along the paths? Will they spend more supplies and degrade their equipment to travel quickly through the forests? Or will they chance being waylaid by the many dangers of the Woodland\u2014anything from bandits to squads of soldiers to BEARS?\nVagabonds are all very skilled and capable individuals\u2014after all, they have to be in order to survive! To represent their capabilities, every vagabond has access to all the basic moves, their own special playbook moves, and weapon moves.\nWeapon moves are the skills that the vagabonds use in combat to wield their weapons with unmatched prowess. Each vagabond will have access to a portion of the overall weapon moves, and as long as they have the right weaponry to then use those moves, they can perform incredible feats, from smashing through heavy armor with a single blow, to bouncing arrows off walls to reach an unreachable target, to taking out unsuspecting foes instantly.\nIn Root: The Tabletop Roleplaying Game, each vagabond has three tracks representing their wellbeing. Their exhaustion track represents how tired they are, how much energy they have left to give. Their decay track represents how much of their supplies they\u2019ve used up. And their injury track represents how many major blows they\u2019ve taken.\nUsing the three different tracks lets the Root RPG land consequences in different ways, pushing the vagabonds to take different actions to deal with those consequences. A band of vagabonds with all their decay boxes marked will need to seek more supplies or the aid of a blacksmith, and soon, while a band with all their exhaustion boxes marked needs to find a safe place to hunker down and rest. Filling in these boxes will ultimately lead to more stories as the vagabonds move from clearing to clearing to resupply and recover.\nRoot: A Game of Woodland Might & Right, the original Root board game, featured a Woodland at war, caught in a struggle between different, powerful factions. The Marquise de Cat and her industrializing armies; the Eyrie Dynasties and their bureaucratic structure; the Woodland Alliance and its insurgent revolts. The Vagabond was one of the factions in the original game, but its role was often of a single adventurer, slipping in and out of greater conflicts, helping one side, hurting another, all the while ready to tip the scales in favor of one group or another.\nIn Root: The Tabletop Roleplaying Game, that idea of a living backdrop for the adventures of the vagabond is crucial. Clearings will not sit, static and unchanging, while the vagabonds go on adventures. They will be taken or lost in the wars between the factions. Sometimes those factions might actually improve the clearings. Other times those factions will destroy buildings, take advantage of the populace, and take hold of any valuable resources.\n\nAnd amid this ongoing war between the factions for control of the Woodland, the vagabonds will adventure and tip the balance. They will have reputations with different factions, allowing them to borrow resources or even lead forces from friendly factions, and leading to constant conflict with opposing factions. Their decisions will change the Woodland.\nWe\u2019re excited to bring to you two different books through this Kickstarter, along with digital versions of both and deluxe, Kickstarter Exclusive editions!\nRoot: The Tabletop Roleplaying Game and Root: Travelers & Outsiders will both come in PDF form.

Our experienced team put their entire artistic skill and hearts into this project, making sure the designs are extremely unique and successfully evoke the fleeting world of dreams. \nEtherfields will be packed with fresh and unique art. Your every skill, action, and even the smallest event will be illustrated with an outstanding craftsmanship. \nYour body has been taken. That's the only thing you know for sure. Your memory has faded away, as you drifted to this strange world of dark dreams. You are an empty vessel now. Looking around, you find masks lying around. Which one will you choose? What story will you follow?\nSomething is coming, and you can feel it \u2013 one dream, consuming all others, leaving a faint smell of poppy seeds. What does the Funeral Witch want of you?\nYour Heroes will be defined by their memory chests. These skills have some of the most surprising rules you ever witnessed in a Board Game \u2013 from literally escaping current reality to your \u201cdream room\u201d for a few turns, up to time modifying time or rewriting the reality. In dreams, no rules are unbreakable!\nThroughout the game, you will very often modify your chest with amazing new cards, but also with curses or filters.\n\nEvery interaction you will have in this strange world leaves a mark \u2013 and may lead to surprising results, as normal rules do not apply in Etherfields. You've managed to finally extinguish the ever-burning Lighthouse in Tideless Port?  This may help you find that key you have been looking for, but now Umbrageous will hunt you down through other dreams.\n\nDuring the game, fighting will never be your only option. Quite often it might actually be the worst option, as in dreams everyone you kill may come back, angrier and weirder. Instead, all characters may interact on two other levels \u2013 through cheating or utilizing their perception.\n Etherfields will test you in many different ways: secret rules that you can discover or deduce by looking closely on the map; drafting cards based on art or name only; guessing the intentions of entities you meet by considering what they do. \nBig, mind-melting concepts are the fuel of Etherfields, and we can't wait for you to discover them!  \n Click here for full version!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have currently successfully founded eight Kickstarter projects.

When Brooklynn and I first funded, we were in awe at the reception. We put ourselves out there and we were able to raise nearly $350,000 from an idea that we had no idea anyone even wanted.\n\nWhen you\u2019re just a couple of lowly artists and you see that amount of cash hit your bank account, you think you have all of the money in the world. And we spent it as such.\n\nWe immediately hired on two full-time employees, Brenna and Clayton. Without these two, we could not have made Middara the way that it is today. In retrospect though, we really didn\u2019t have a plan laid out to any degree. Brooklynn and I were poor managers. We threw ourselves into the position of an employer with no previous experience doing so. Full-time employees are expensive and when a project goes 3 years past it\u2019s deadline, calling it expensive is an understatement.\n\nA couple years after the campaign funded, the real gravity of the situation began to hit us. We received an invoice from Panda and our heart\u2019s sank. (And this was before we even saw the shipping quote!) There was no way we could make this happen without help. Many companies would have probably given up at this point, broken the news to their backers, or ghosted them completely. We\u2019ve seen it before. \n\nThe thing is, we knew we had something special. We playtested two times weekly, paying our friends in pizza, coffee, and beer. Everyone raved about the game. We\u2019d take Middara to conventions and people loved it. We\u2019d have regulars year after year, hanging out at our booth wanting to know more. I would sometimes find myself daydreaming about how I\u2019d build my character (I always play Zeke).\n\nPanda believed in Middara as well. It was a showpiece for them. Their employees were proud of the game. So we were able to negotiate a deal with them where they allowed us the our pre-production (PPC) without upfront payment. This was huge for us.\n\nThe game looked incredible, even in its unfinished form.\n\nWe showed this PPC off and the reception was spectacular. Our backers were very impressed!\n\nSo, we finally had something to show off. I started Google searching ideas for where I could raise some capital to finish what we started. There were some local start-up incubators in Salt Lake City that I was able to get in contact with and I applied online to pitch my idea to them. They initially laughed when I told them that I had a board game to bring in, but after they saw Middara, they changed their tune pretty quick. When people think of a board game, they think of Monopoly. This was not Monopoly. \n\nWe would meticulously plan out or pitches but we\u2019d have so much interest from the crowd that the pitch would quickly devolve into a 20 minute Q&A session. We didn\u2019t mind. It was exciting to see the interest.\n\nNot to bore anyone with the details (if you\u2019re interested go ahead and email me at alex@succubuspublishing.com) but we hit the pavement hard. We pitched to EVERYONE. Angel networks, friends and family, VC firms, other board game companies, banks, online creditors\u2026 you name it. Giving up was never an option for us. We probably ended up pitching to over 100 different potential investors / funders.\n\nAfter all this practice, we started getting good at it. We became even more confident in Middara. And when you\u2019re meeting constantly with these types of people, you learn about the real inner workings of a healthy business.\n\nBrooklynn and I joke that we\u2019ve earned our business degrees in the last year and a half from all the things we\u2019ve gone through. All the while, we remained positive and calm with our backers.\n \nWe knew we\u2019d make it happen.\n\nWe built up the confidence to pitch Middara to anyone. We ended up presenting in front of some very high net worth groups in Park City, Utah. Something that would\u2019ve terrified us a year prior.\n\nSo, long story short. We put everything on the line. We were able to recruit an amazing combination of partners on board with us. We were able to raise the capital we needed to fund the manufacturing and fulfillment of Middara and give us a runway to the reprint campaign that you\u2019re seeing today.\n\nI\u2019m not telling you this so that you feel bad for us. I\u2019m telling you this because I want you to feel confident in becoming a backer of Succubus Publishing knowing that we will never give up on you.\n\nWe now have a team behind us that can make a campaign like this one a reality.\n\nTo our returning backers, we love you guys with all of our hearts. You made our dreams come true. Brooklynn and I have struggled but it\u2019s been the best time of our lives.\n\nAnd to our new backers, we hope you\u2019ll join the ride with us.

In the spring of 2018 we Kickstarted To The Barricades!, adding solo and CoOp play and two additional Quests, which were delivered in the spring of 2019.\nNew Horizons\nAfter the climactic battle in Quest 4: At the Foundations of the World, the Champions are dispersed by the forces of wild magic. One awakens in a far realm of endless sands. Another discovers himself in a strange new city where he may learn the fate of his people.\nThe world of Thunderstone Quest is even larger than we could ever imagine. It's time to explore these New Horizons.\nBack the campaign TODAY to begin or continue your Thunderstone Quest adventure!\nDue to the overwhelming support of the community, the $400,000 Stretch Goal has been Achieved! \nWe will add the 4th Level Heroes Add-on to all New Horizons Rewards (and Rewards that include New Horizons)! Congratulations to everyone who helped rally the community to reach this HUGE goal!\nBecause of Kickstarter's rules, we cannot change the description of the Rewards to note that the 4th Level Heroes have been added.\n(Backers who choose the \"Your Inventory is Full\" Reward will be issued a $25 credit in the Pledge Manager)\nThis Kickstarter features two new Quests: Quest 8: Vengeful Sands and Quest 9: Clockwork Destiny, both designed by Bryan Reese with story written by Brett Satkowiak. \nAll Quests including Vengeful Sands and Clockwork Destiny can be played in either Barricades Mode or Competitive Mode. \nThis campaign also includes a special promo pack for Barricades Mode: Ezuzrius' Lair (estimated MSRP $9.99) included in the New Horizons Reward (and all Rewards that contain the New Horizons reward)! Ezuzrius' Lair is a Kickstarter Early Access release, meaning that Kickstarter backers will get this promotional pack before it is available for sale. At this time we do not have a planned retail release for this item. \nYou have four options to back this Kickstarter - New Horizons which consists of just the new content in this campaign, Champion which consists of the Champion Reward from the 1st Kickstarter, Champion + Barricades + New Horizons which combines all three Kickstarter Rewards into one Reward, and Your Inventory is Full! which includes everything we make for Thunderstone Quest.\nYour Inventory is Full!\n(If you have a Thunderstone Quest base game (Retail, Adventurer or Champion) and did not back To the Barricades, you will be able to add it as an Add-on in the Pledge Manager with your New Horizons pledge.)\nWe are also offering a limited quantity of Expedited Rewards. Because of the long lead time for production of the new content in this Kickstarter we will not be able to deliver the new content until next year. But we have set aside a limited quantity of Champion and Barricades components so that we can swiftly manufacture enough units for delivery this November! \nNew Horizons and Add-ons to Expedited orders will ship next year with the rest of the Rewards.\nNote for Expedited Backers: After the campaign ends, you can not drop your Expedited Pledge, switch to Your Inventory Is Full! and still get your Expedited components. If you have an Expedited Reward, don't change it. In the Pledge Manager there will be a special Add-on option just for you that will allow you to get all the contents of Your Inventory is Full! at the same price as the Reward listed in this Kickstarter, and keep your Expedited Status.\nIf you drop your Expedited Reward, we can't re-instate it. So don't drop it unless you really, really don't want your shipment Expedited.\nThis campaign also includes a special Add-on: 4th Level Heroes! The 4th Level Heroes bring more power and abilities to the game.\nNote to all Backers:  The Champion/To the Barricades! boxes contain space to hold these two new Quests and they will be shipped without the individual boxes shown in the graphics for this campaign. If you would like to order the boxes for these Quests they'll be available for a small fee as Add-ons in the Pledge Manager.\nNote to Non-English Speakers: All the contents of this campaign are in English only. AEG is working with a team of international partners on future campaigns for non-English language support which we'll be announcing later in 2019.\n Benefits to this Campaign: \nYou will get the product at a discount to the suggested retail price ($39.99 x 2 Quests + an estimated $9.99 for Ezuzuris' Lair)\nYou'll get the New Horizons content before the normal retail release\nYou'll get the Ezuzrius' Lair Promo Pack\nYou'll get the 4th Level Heroes Add-on\nIf your order includes the Champion Reward you will receive Kickstarter Exclusive Content\nIf your order includes the Champion Reward and/or the To the Barricades Reward you'll get the large boxes & storage system with those Rewards\nQualified Brick & Mortar Retail Stores please see the Kick It Here section below for details on the Kick It Here Reward. \nVengeful Sands Previews\nWe are pleased to showcase some of the cards from Quest 8: Vengeful Sands here on the Kickstarter Campaign page. You can see all of these previews as blog entries at alderac.com!\nScarabs (1 of 3)\nClick this image to download the Rulebook (26MB PDF)\nClick this link to download the Questbook (33MB PDF)\nClick here to download the Barricades Mode Rulebook & Questbook\nThunderstone Quest is a deckbuilding game where 2-4 players (or 1-6 players in Barricades Mode) compete to see who can score the most victory points when the game ends. In deckbuilding games your objective is to try to assemble the best possible deck to achieve the play strategy you prefer based on the options that are assembled for each game, and the random challenges you'll need to overcome.\nEach player's deck represents a party of stalwart adventurers who will face and defeat the challenges of the Dungeon and will return to the Village to recover and re-equip.\nOn each turn you use your deck to generate a hand of cards, and you take actions based on the cards you drew. Sometimes you'll be in the Village buying new cards and using your resources. Sometimes you'll be in the Dungeon fighting monsters. And sometimes you'll do a little bit of both!\nIn Thunderstone Quest you'll be playing an adventure which is comprised of a set of Dungeon tiles and a selection of monsters, treasures, and challenges that are themed to that Dungeon. You'll get the sense of a dramatic campaign as you grow stronger and finally confront the Guardian.\nDepending on which cards you buy and which adversaries you defeat you will earn victory points. After the Guardian encounter is over, the player with the most victory points is the winner!\nThe competitive mode is designed for 2 to 4 people (up to 6 people with To The Barricades content!) to play and it takes about 90 minutes to complete an Adventure. Barricades mode is designed for 1 to 6 people to play and will also take about 90 minutes to complete an Adventure.  \nYou can add funds to your pledge as described in the graphic above which will be automatically credited to your account in the Pledge Manager. Or, you can wait until the Pledge Manager opens and purchase Add-ons directly, paying the balance due on your order in the Pledge Manager instead. There is no difference in price or availability. Altering your pledge on Kickstarter is convenient and it helps us grow the total amount pledged which has a positive effect for attracting more Backers.\nTo the Barricades (not shown)\nYou will be able to order To the Barricades in the Pledge Manager as an Add-on. It will be priced at $50 + Shipping & Handling (approximately $15 for US backers). It will be identical to the previous Kickstarter Reward and will have all stretch goals in that Reward. We won't be able to ship them Expedited unless they're included in an Expedited Reward.\nEpic Thunderstone Support for Champion: \nThis is a special set of over 200 cards that supports Epic-style play of Thunderstone Quest for the Champion Rewards. The Champion Reward does not include an extra copy of every card for Epic Thunderstone use.\nEpic Thunderstone is a popular way to play invented by players of Classic Thunderstone. In Epic Thunderstone you build a Village and a Dungeon draw pile using one of each of all your cards instead of playing with a pre-selected tableau. It's a way to see and use more of your card collection. Every game will be different.\nRules for Epic Thunderstone are included in the main rulebook. You can read those rules in the Rulebook link above!\nThe purpose of this Add-On is purely convenience. There is no content in the Epic Add-On that isn't already in the Champion Reward.\nAll the content in To The Barricades! and all new content for New Horizons in this campaign will be Epic-compatible and will have Epic support automatically included.\nThere are extensive answers about Epic Thunderstone and this Add-On in the FAQ. Please check to see if your question has already been answered before asking in the Comment thread.\nYou'll need a base copy of Thunderstone Quest (Champion, Adventurer or Retail) to play the Epic variant since there are cards, boards, tokens and other resources in the base game that are required to play Epic Thunderstone.\n4th Level Heroes\nNOTE: The campaign has achieved it's $400,000 Stretch Goal and this Add-on will automatically be included in every New Horizons Reward! You do not need to pay extra to get this Stretch Goal benefit!\nThis is a special deck of cards which adds a 4th experience level to every Hero in the game from Quests 1-9 as well as the extra Heroes released with the Champion box. There are over fifty 4th Level Heroes in this package!\nThere will be 2 copies of each 4th level hero, one for use in normal Competitive and Barricades Mode play, and a second for use in Epic Thunderstone mode.\nQuest 2: Total Eclipse of the Sun\nThis Add-on is for people who have purchased the Retail Base Set and did not back either of the previous Kickstarters. The Champion Reward contains a Quest which is Kickstarter Exclusive and is not available in retail stores as a stand-alone purchase. You can buy that Quest via this Add-on.\nUpdate: 17 June: Based on a suggestion from backer @Chris, we're upgrading this Add-on to include all the additional promo cards added to the Champion Reward during the 1st Kickstarter so that you will be able to get every card released for Thunderstone Quest in the Champion unit if you get this Add-on, the Retail Base and the retail release of Quest 4 and Quest 5!\nThis change will add about 50 more cards to this Add-on at no additional charge!\nPlease Note: If you have or are buying the Champion Reward, or if you bought the Adventurer Reward from the 1st Kickstarter, you already have this Quest.\nThe Quest will be delivered in a plain white tuckbox, not the retail packaging. You must back the campaign at the New Horizons pledge level to order this Add-on.\nNeoprene Playmat\nThis is one of the most requested upgrades from the community and we're proud to announce that we'll be able to make Neoprene Playmats available as a part of this Kickstarter!\nWe've also heard the suggestions that the size of the Village board is larger than some groups prefer, and this Playmat also addresses that concern. It is substantially smaller than the board included in the main game. \nThe Playmat is double-sided. One side is the \"day\" layout for competitive play. And the reverse is the \"night\" side with spaces for the Barricades board overlays, showing the Village partially destroyed. The \"night\" side is intentionally darker than the day side to reflect the perilous condition of the Village!\nThe Playmat will be sized so that it can fit within either the Champion or the To The Barricades box, box, rolled up. The length is 300 mm.\nPremium Sleeves\nThese are AEG Premium Sleeves, also used in Mystic Vale, Edge of Darkness, and Valley of the Kings Premium. They have an excellent reputation for durability!\nThe Sleeves are 66x91mm, 0.09mm thick (0.09mm = 90\u00b5 (or \"microns\" = 3.54 \"mils\")) and will fit Thunderstone Quest cards and cards that are the same size as Magic: The Gathering cards.\nWe are providing them in packs of 500 Sleeves for $15 per pack. You can order as many packs as you wish.\nTo sleeve every playable card in the Champion Reward and the Epic Add-On you would need 4 packs (2,000 Sleeves).\nYou will need 2 more packs to sleeve the all the new content in To the Barricades! including randomizers, Epic support cards, the 5th and 6th player support and other cards provided for Barricades Mode.\nYou will need 2 packs total to sleeve all the content in New Horizons.\nTo sleeve everything you'll need 8 packs of sleeves.\nYou can store all 9 Quests, starting cards, Kickstarter exclusive cards, and Epic support cards, sleeved, in the Champion and To the Barricades boxes. Space is also available for the rolled up playmat and all other game components. \nWe have configured our logistics system to provide the lowest average cost for all our Backers while working with trusted partners for delivery of your Rewards.\nIf you selected an Expedited reward you will receive your Champion and To The Barricades boxes in an expedited early shipment in November. You will need to log in to your order in the Pledge Manager and provide your delivery information immediately after the campaign ends to ensure you get the fastest possible delivery.\nNext year when the rest of the Kickstarter Rewards for this campaign are delivered Expedited backers will get all the rest of their order including any Add-ons they have ordered in a 2nd shipment.\nIf you have any questions please email kickstarter@alderac.com.\nWe will be charging shipping after the Kickstarter concludes based on the actual costs incurred to ship from the closest distribution center to your delivery address. You will pay for shipping & handling in our Pledge Manager. Links to the Pledge Manager will be sent shortly after the Kickstarter campaign ends. \nShipping costs vary widely based on where you will receive your reward.\nUnited States & Canadian Backers: As you may know the Administration is preparing to implement a 25% import tariff on goods shipped to the US from China. We have estimated the impact these tariffs will have on the importation of your Rewards and have adjusted the costs of the Rewards and the Shipping & Handling estimates accordingly. There will be no additional charge made for the tariffs if and when they are imposed.\nWe will ship your Rewards at our cost to our international distribution centers. Based on your delivery address we will either ship to you from our Depot in the EU, in China, in Australia or from the USA.\nThe following chart are estimates for shipping Champion + Barricades! + New Horizons without Add-Ons. Orders that include Add-Ons will be more expensive.\nWe are currently estimating the weight of Champion + Barricades! + New Horizons at 33lbs/15kg. The following estimates are for both the regular and Expedited Rewards.\nThe following chart also provides estimates for shipping Your Inventory is Full without Add-Ons. Orders that include Add-Ons will be more expensive.\nWe are currently estimating the weight of Your Inventory Is Full at 47lbs/21kg\nUSA: Shipping & Handling included\nCANADA: $15\nEUROPE: Shipping & Handling included to Germany. $15 to EU + UK, Norway, Switzerland & Lichtenstein \nASIA: $10 to China and Hong Kong. $30 to most other countries. \nOCEANIA: $20 to Australia. $60 to New Zealand. \nRest of World: $60\nThe following chart are estimates for shipping New Horizons without Add-Ons.

That is subject to change due to the advance nature of this campaign but Aetherworks is our currently preferred provider and our estimates for shipping to Australia and New Zealand reflect their cost structure.\nUnfortunately, different import laws and customs from some specific countries have made it impossible for AEG to ship games to them.\nWE DO NOT SHIP TO: Brazil, Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Afghanistan.\nAlderac Entertainment Group is committed to supporting brick & mortar retail game stores. Our Kick It Here program is designed to let stores participate in the fun and excitement of a Kickstarter campaign. \nThe Kick It Here program is open to brick & mortar retail stores who generate a meaningful percentage of their sales from tabletop games. Kick It Here products may not be resold on the internet. AEG reserves the right to disqualify any backer from this promotion at its sole discretion.\nKick It Here orders are available to any brick & mortar store anywhere we ship the Kickstarter Rewards to with the same Shipping & Handling costs as regular Backers.\nYou have to back this project at the Kick It Here Reward level to get the Kick It Here pricing and delivery. \nIf you select the $66 Kick It Here Reward level you will be eligible to make the full $195 purchase for 6 units of New Horizons in the Pledge Manager. The $66 you pay on Kickstarter will automatically be credited to your account as a pre-payment.\nAccess to Champion & Barricades Rewards: You will be able to order the Champion and Barricades Rewards as Add-ons to your Kick It Here order. However, due to the high cost of manufacturing these items we cannot offer a discount to the Kickstarter price; your price for Champion will be $120 per unit, and your price for Barricades will be $60. Due to the extremely large size of these boxes and their substantial weight they are usually shipped individually which means there's no meaningful savings on shipping for bulk orders.\nAccess to the Neoprene Playmat, Epic Support, 4th Level Heroes, Quest 2, and AEG Premium Sleeves: All of these Add-ons will be available for purchase via the Kick It Here program with a small discount from the Add-on prices as listed. You will be able to view these prices in the Pledge Manager.\nPlease Note: If you do not qualify as a brick & mortar retail store, or you fail to complete your order in the Pledge Manager, AEG can only refund you 92% of the amount you pledge. The other 8% is lost to unrecoverable Kickstarter fees.\nGroup Buys: AEG does not do group buys or offer increased discounts on Reward prices or shipping for multiple orders.\nKick It Here orders will ship at the same time as the other Kickstarter Rewards.\nAEG would like to thank the following experts who helped make this campaign possible: \nMike Elliott, Original Design & Development of Thunderstone\nMike Elliott, Bryan Reese & Mark Wootton, Design & Development of Thunderstone Quest\nByan Reese & Satkowiak for design and writing for Quest 8 & 9\nMatt Paquette, Kickstarter Campaign Page graphics\nErick Santz, producer for animated game segment in the campaign video\nJohnny Stone, voice work for the main campaign video\nHonor at Last by Hector Posser; Production music courtesy of www.epidemicsound.com \nThis project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 650+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $300MM raised between them.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAt the end of the campaign we will cancel and refund any pledge of less than $50.

All card counts are approximate and are subject to change. All card and component names are subject to change. All packaging is subject to change and is not finalized. Rules are subject to change.\n\nAlderac Entertainment Group has been in the publishing business for more than 20 years. We are experienced at producing games in China and distributing them worldwide. Nonetheless there are always risks associated with manufacturing and logistics.\n\nThese problems can delay or otherwise impact our ability to meet our commitments to our backers.\n\nThese issues include (but are not limited to):\n\n* Production delays \n* Shipping delays \n* Customs delays\n\nThe estimated delivery date is June 2020, but keep in mind this is only an estimate. Also, due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others.\n\nWe've done our best to minimize these risks as much as possible, and we are always happy to refund pledges if for some totally unforeseen reason the game can't be delivered at all.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nBefore the Rewards are shipped we offer no questions asked refunds. Once we have shipped your Reward our refund policy will depend on the circumstances and will be at our discretion.\n\nAt your request we can give you a full refund within 14 days of the campaign\u2019s end, fees included. After that we will subtract Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we can\u2019t get back from Kickstarter after 14 days). Those fees usually equal 8% of the total pledge.\n\nRefunds will be processed through Kickstarter and will be applied to whatever payment method you provided to Kickstarter. In the event that is impossible we will work with you to arrange a refund through other channels.\n\nThis project is being funded in USD and any refunds processed will be in USD for the exact amount received in USD, excluding any applicable fees depending on the time of the refund being processed. Not responsible for changes in the rate of foreign exchange.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nBy pledging to this project, you agree to conduct all public interactions via Kickstarter's communications channels with this project and our team and other backers in a positive manner. Harassment, name-calling, or attempts to inject inappropriate content into the public communications channels for the project will result in the cancellation of your pledge (with a full refund) and your ejection from the campaign. We want the communications channels for this campaign to be a friendly, positive place for our community to gather and discuss the campaign, ask questions, and provide input.\n\nAEG reserves the right to cancel any pledge (with a full refund) at any time, for any reason. If your pledge is cancelled while the campaign is ongoing you agree not to re-pledge either under your original account or under any other account you control. Violations of this policy will be reported to Kickstarter.\n\nMinor cosmetic damage to the box or other packaging can occur during shipping. AEG makes reasonable efforts to ensure that the shipping containers it uses are suitable for the safe delivery of the Rewards. If you believe that your Reward has suffered more than minor cosmetic damage please contact us immediately. Keep all packaging including outer cartons for our inspection. AEG will at its sole discretion determine if the damage constitutes other than minor cosmetic damage and/or was the result of insufficient packaging.\n\nIf we ship to the address that you provided in our Pledge Manager and the package is returned to us as undeliverable you will pay the full cost to ship the Reward again to a revised address.\n\nIf we ship the Reward to the address you provided in our Pledge Manager and the package is delivered to that address but you are unable to receive it, or you have moved and are no longer the occupant of that address and cannot otherwise retrieve the package, or if the package is lost or stolen after delivery, and you wish to have the order fulfilled again you will pay the full cost to ship the order to a revised address plus the amount of the original Reward plus Add-Ons and other upgrades on your order.\n\nIn all cases you acknowledge that quantities are limited and AEG may not be able to ship all or part of your order more than once.\n\nIf any part of your order cannot be fulfilled for any reason AEG will provide you with a pro-rated refund for that portion of your order.\n\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look, materials and content of the rewards (and the project) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented while the Kickstarter project was active.\n\nIf you do not log in to our Pledge Manager and confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email to confirm your pledge, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received. However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your Reward if you contact us and confirm your pledge after the 8 week window has elapsed.\n\nIf you confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our Pledge Manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods. \n\nWe regret we are unable to ship to PO Boxes.\n\nIf you do not accept these terms, please do not pledge on this project but instead wait for the general release.\n\nIf you have questions or concerns about these terms & conditions please email kickstarter@alderac.com for further information.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 65 or more", "title": "New Horizons", "descp": "The new content for this Kickstarter for backers who already own Thunderstone Quest.\nRequires Thunderstone Quest base game.\nSHIPPING & HANDLING INCLUDED for the US and Germany.\nTARIFF PROTECTION INCLUDED.

Then they'll begin picking & packing orders for pickup by the carriers. When the carrier picks up you may or may not receive an email telling you that an order is scheduled to ship. Orders will ship as the Depots process the orders, which may not all happen at the same time so some people may get orders while others are still unshipped.\n\n3: When all shipments from all Depots have finished, the logistics partner will receive tracking numbers for all packages, which are then transmitted to us. Until that step, we . When we receive the tracking information we will email all customers. We will also upload those tracking numbers into the pledge manager which MAY trigger an additional email notification to you that your order has \"shipped\".

Chinese factories close in January for the Lunar New Year, when many workers return home to their ancestral villages, celebrate with family & friends, and then travel back to their places of employment. This year, the Chinese Government has declared that the Lunar New Year holiday period will be extended, and movement inside of China has been restricted. All of the factories that we work with have been impacted.\n\nAs a result of these policies, work we expected to be underway at this time on your Kickstarter Rewards is on hold. When the factories re-open and travel is again permitted we expect that there will be a substantial backlog of work which will further impact the timing of the delivery of your Rewards.\n\nDue to the fluid and uncertain nature of the Chinese manufacturing infrastructure we cannot at this time provide firm estimates of when your Rewards will ship to you. We will continue to update you as we know more about the timing of production and fulfillment. Today, we believe that Rewards will be delayed at least one month from our original estimates.\n\nWe're sincerely sorry for these delays and the ripple effects they'll cause for other projects in the Thunderstone Quest and Edge of Darkness lines. We're working with our Chinese factories to ensure that when the restart happens we'll be able to communicate back to all our backers what our revised timelines will be.\n\nYou can always see the most current information we have about our Kickstarter projects by visiting our Kickstarter page:\n\n\n\nThis page will be updated as soon as we have new information on any project.\n\nIf after reading this message you have further questions please contact and we'll be happy to help!"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #20", "update_userinfo": "January Update", "update_content": "Champions of Thunderstone!\nThis Update will serve as notice of two developments. \nFirst, the Expedited portions of Expedited orders have been shipped to backers who processed their orders before the Expedited window was closed.

The shipping price you will pay is based on the weight of your pledge and the country to which it is to be shipped.\nThe following is a list of rough estimates for shipping Super Fantasy Brawl. These estimates are based on the costs for our previous campaigns and an estimated final weight of the core pledge at 5kg. Keep in mind that adding optional buys or additional pledge levels will raise the weight of your pledge and may also then raise the final shipping price.\n USA: $20\n CANADA: $25\n EUROPE (EU): $20\n EUROPE (non-EU): $30-$45\n LATIN AMERICA: $85-$140\n OCEANIA: $35 to Australia. $70 to New-Zealand\n EASTERN ASIA: $35 to China. $40-$70 to other countries\n REST OF THE WORLD (including French overseas territories - DOM TOM): $70 to Israel. $85-$140 to other countries \nREFUND POLICY\nWe have a no-questions-asked refund policy. \nAll pledges can be refunded in full up to 14 days after the end of the Kickstarter campaign. In addition, if any part of your order cannot be delivered, then we will reimburse you the full cost of this component regardless of the date. \nIf you apply for a refund more than 14 days after the end of the Kickstarter then we will only be able to refund 85% of it. The difference is the amount of the unrecoverable fees paid to process your order.\nOnce we have started to process and pack your order, refunds will no longer be available. \nRefunds within the first 14 days are reversed via Stripe to the credit card you used to pledge originally. Any refunds requested after the 14 day period may be processed via PayPal or reversed via Stripe or your credit card.

Producing thousands of products and coordinating their delivery to homes across the planet is a complex business, and there are many things which could go wrong. This is why we build in as much time for the unforeseen as possible. We want to ensure that we have the space to deal with any unexpected setbacks and still get your game to you before the estimated delivery date. \n\nTo give you a frame of reference for exactly when you will get your game, Mythic Battles: Pantheon began delivery earlier than estimated, whilst Time of Legends: Joan of Arc was a bit late and is now being delivered. Solomon Kane is a big scope project and we have announced that we would be late. Reichbusters: Projekt Vril is still on track. For all our games, we communicate with our backers with regular updates at least once a week, plus our posts on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and our videos on YouTube. Super Fantasy Brawl is a much smaller project than any of our previous ones to minimise the risk of it shipping later than the estimate. This game is launched on Kickstarter where we hope to gather a community, but it will also go to retail, where we'll have an ambitious organised play programme and regular release of new Champions.\n\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look, materials, and content of the rewards (and the project) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented in this Kickstarter project.\n\nIf you do not finalise your pledge and pay for shipping by the closing date of the pledge manager, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received.

Compete with rival divers in a frantic race to the escape pods, or work together in a story-driven experience to defeat the kraken!\nWhichever game mode you choose, you'll be one of eight asymmetric characters in an immersive, cinematic experience that takes you head to head with an angry Kraken! \nThe Refuge: Terror from the Deep includes 25 gorgeous miniatures.\nWe have been fortunate enough to work with two amazing sculptors: David Whitaker & Tom Lishman.   David's work includes minis for Lord of the Rings: Journeys into Middle Earth, Moonstone,  and more. Tom has sculpted for games such as Dark Souls: the Board Game, Descent 2nd Edition, and Godtear.  We're incredibly excited about the miniatures in The Refuge: Terror from the Deep, and we think you will be too. \nA larger scale brings out more details and make minis easier to handle and paint.\nPainted by Den of Imagination. Miniatures supplied unpainted.\nThe Refuge: Terror from the Deep's  competitive dive is based on our 2016 release The Refuge: A Race for Survival.  The Refuge: a race for survival continues to be enjoyed by gamers all over the world, and is well-received for combining exciting, fast-paced gameplay with simple mechanics. We're excited to take that to the next level in competitive dive \u2013 an action filled race to the finish!\nEscape The Kraken \u2013 or Die Trying\nIn competitive dives, 2-6 players race to the escape pods of the mysterious UB-85 submarine. To reach the refuge of the escape pods, players must carefully plan their movement to outwit their opponents \u2014 and to avoid the Kraken's wrath!  \nTo win, be the first diver to reach the escape pods at the end of the board with a Decryptor or complete an Objective for the key to a specific pod.\n On your turn, you take one action:\nMove your character one space and activate the space you land on\nDraw a Salvage card\nPlay a Salvage card\nUse one of your character's abilities\n As you move, you'll activate spaces on the board with special features: \n Spawn spaces let you place pesky tentacles on other unoccupied Spawn spaces.\n Cave spaces are safe and tentacles can't reach you there. \n Whirlpool spaces let you switch with a player who is currently on a Cave.\n Lair spaces lets you control the Kraken's tentacles to knock defenseless characters back to the start. \nCard Driven Combos:\nCombining your hand of Salvage cards, Character abilities, and movement allows you to chain together devastating moves \u2014 propelling you toward the final goal and luring tentacles to attack your opponents. Don't wait too long to string together the perfect combination though: a slow start means there will be a dozen tentacles blocking your path!\n Solo and Cooperative dives bring you an immersive, cinematic experience in the world of The Refuge. 1-4 divers will work together to solve a series of challenging objectives deep beneath the sea \u2013 as the Kraken threatens to overwhelm them. The victory conditions change every game, providing new challenges and puzzles each time you dive (especially as you try each of the asymmetric characters).\nAll the action of an underwater monster movie in 30 minutes!\nStory-driven Experience \nTo win, you'll need to complete all three objectives without being overwhelmed by the Kraken. Each Objective drives a little more of your undersea story \u2013 you might need to recover a shipwreck, research the Kraken's behavior, or get devoured by the Kraken and cut your way out from the inside!\nWhen you complete an objective, you earn the reward on the back side!\n On your turn, take two actions:\nMove your character one space and activate the space you land on\nPlay a Salvage card \nUse a Character Ability \nDiscard two matching Salvage cards to recover a diver or Character ability\nYou'll need to carefully plan with your teammates to combine your Salvage and Character abilities to accomplish objectives, because at the end of each turn, you'll reveal a Kraken card, which will move the Kraken's head and the tentacles on the board. \nEasy and Intuitive Kraken AI:\nThe top section of each Kraken card moves its head, and the bottom section moves the tentacles in the three columns of the board directly in front of the head. \nIf the Kraken's tentacles reach your starting area, you'll gain Threat - which can make you lose the game. When you eliminate tentacles, you'll earn valuable Salvage cards which will help you accomplish your goals:\nBuilt from the Ground Up for Solo:\nAt every step of the way \u2013 cooperative dives were designed with solo in mind. All objectives work as a solo diver, and the Kraken AI already provides a powerful and flexible framework for a solo opponent:\nThe Refuge: Terror from the Deep is a standalone sequel to B&B Games Studios' 2016 release The Refuge: a race for survival, and does not require the base game.  However, every pledge comes with 18 Kickstarter Exclusive Crossover Character cards for players who own both games!\nThese introduce all new character roles for the 6 player minis in The Refuge: a Race for Survival, and for players who have both Terror from the Deep and Race for Survival, allow you to use the zombie-killing survivors as characters in the competitive dive of Terror from the Deep.\n\nTo purchase an add-on, simply increase your pledge by the corresponding amount.

Join us as we set course to the not so distant future, year 2232.\nOur second Kickstarter campaign seeks to bring two new factions to your tabletops and collections: the  Space Pirates and the godlike Asgars.\nVerge Of War: a scalable and balanced miniatures wargame with RPG elements, representing planetary battles in the original Sci-Fi Universe.  About Human and Seit Factions you can read here https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1560931765/verge-of-war/description  or on our website  www.vergeofwar.com  in Lore section \n\n\n\n\u201cVerge Of War\u201d is a classical wargame with RPG elements.\nThe system is highly scalable, allowing to play both skirmishes and epic battles if players have armies of corresponding sizes.\nThe game uses six-sided dice (or D6), markers, cards and tokens.\n A typical game is very dynamic, consists of 6 game rounds and takes about 40-120 minutes depending on the size of the armies.\n You won\u2019t just stand and watch during your opponent\u2019s turn! You can react to nearly anything they do.\nThe mechanics of \u201cVerge of War\u201d are easy to learn, but there is a lot of strategy involved in its confrontations. Players will have to think carefully: before the battle begins, a player chooses skills for the army commander from three skill sets representing different strategies, doctrines or military specialties. Each set is divided into 10 levels, which reflect the experience and expertise of your commander.\n Players can explore different strategies to find the one that best fits their play style.\n The game is well-balanced: it allows to use any combinations of units and win if you apply the right tactics.\n The Free Pose Technology allows unlimited variants of poses for your models. One set provides endless pose options for your characters.\n Participate in the Verge of War universe development.\n YEAR 2232. Four years passed since the first clash of the Human Empire and the Seit Dominion\u2026 And the Galaxy changed. Forever.\nGreedy, ambitious and cunning humans joined Pirate Warbands and turned them into a bane of galactic routes. Their raider fleets have become a threat that only the greatest states are able to counter. \n      Pirates are by no means a unified faction. They\u2019re as far from a regular army as one can get, and still they definitely are a bane of the Galaxy. Reasons for becoming a pirate are as numerous as pirates themselves. Some are exiles, some want to prove something, some are led by simple greed. Different gangs may have different motives, but they are still what they are: groups of criminals, ready to gather under a strong leader and try their luck.\nPirates are quite an irregular bunch, but still they have to gather at secret bases or outposts to plan massed operations, repair ships and sell stolen goods.\n Thirunga Port: mostly famous for piracy on trade routes.\n Zarzarah Port: the most violent fellowship out there. Plunderers, kidnappers and slavers that aren\u2019t above anything.\n Ranghera Port: the biggest slaver guild.\n Almara Port: mercenaries, offering their services to anyone able to pay.\nPainted Pirate Captain model\nVoid Raiders Team: Scale comparison\n     Asgar are one of the oldest races in the Galaxy. At the dawn of their age, ambitious and powerful Asgar waged wars against other civilizations and wiped them out. They\u2019ve always acted in a cynical and violent way pursuing their own interests and satisfying their ego.\nAt certain point, the Asgar got used to playing gods, mentoring the younger races, giving more to ones and less to others. To see how some of the young races handle crises, the Asgar orchestrated cataclysms and observed. Not all managed to survive.\nThe Asgar founded the Galactic Council to control development and expansion of other civilizations, and everything worked as intended until disaster came... \n\n\n Review Weekender Beastsofwar:\nPLAY\n\n\nGary Krieger, FAEIT 212: \"I think this was the miniature I was most impressed with out of the three types I put together. These are very cool tall warriors that are just fun and beautiful minis capable of being used in not only Verge of War but many other games as well. I can guarantee you will be seeing more of these miniatures. Im dying to get some paint on these guys\" \nBryan, Lion City Geeks: \"I was a bit overwhelmed by the amount of ways that I can put my kit together that I didn\u2019t know which options I wanted.

If all the pirates models are as cool as this one then the pirates might just become the favorite army of many players\u00bb \nBen Rantail, Australian Tabletop Gaming Network (ATGN): \u201cThe game is easy enough to play, the figures are pretty cool (space raptors, that\u2019s all you need) and there is lots of poten... The game flows quickly and the quick start rules are easy to digest without much need to reference or cross check any rules\u201d\n\u201cWhat makes Verge of War a unique beast is the way commanding units \u201clevel up\u201d and grow. As a player racks up the games their commander grows in power accruing additional abilities and buffs to units in their army. What i think is really cool though, is that there are different skill trees a commander can travel down\u201d \n    If you\u2019re interested in purchasing any add-on, just click the Manage your Pledge button at the top of this page, and increase your current pledge amount by the amount of the extra items that you\u2019d like to add. Kickstarter doesn\u2019t let you specify what you want at this stage, so we\u2019ll sort out what your extra money is going towards after the campaign has closed. The system we use for this is called a Pledge Manager, and all backers will be sent a link to this after the Kickstarter campaign closes.\n All miniatures are supplied unpainted and will require assembly. \n\n    Underestimations of shipping fees can seriously impact projects like this, so we are waiting until we are closer to the delivery date to collect those fees. This will ensure more accurate shipping fees (if they continue to rise), prevent us from paying up to 10% of the shipping fees collected to Kickstarter, and give us a better idea of how much money we've actually raised through Kickstarter.\nAll miniatures are supplied unpainted and will require assembly.

You will ask why? We\u2019ve been playing tabletop wargames for more than 10 years and we like them as much as you do. But there has always been something missing in the existing systems, so we communicated with numerous players, asking for their opinions. \nWe kept the proven wargame classics but created a unique developing universe and added many solutions and mechanics that are not present in any other game. \"Verge of War\" is a game from players, for players.

Each of these sets focuses on a new group of Explorer-themed Hero characters, venturing out on expeditions into lands that have been tainted by Dark Stone, and journeying through fantastic gateways into alien Worlds.\n       Each of these sets is fully compatible with all previous Shadows of Brimstone material, but can also be played on its own as a stand-alone Adventure Set!\nNote - Final contents may vary from those shown here.\nValley of the Serpent Kings\n      In the Valley of the Serpent Kings  Adventure Set, players take on the role of a group of Spanish Conquistadors, exploring the dark halls and stone ramparts of a Spanish Fort  that has fallen into Darkness, overrun by demons and creatures.\nAs a Team of Conquistador Heroes, you can play as the fearless El Capitan, leading his men with boundless ambition, the classic Explorer, guiding the expedition through the jungle swamps, the armored Soldier, a front line fighter armed with a heavy crossbow to skewer all but the toughest of Enemies, or the agile and deadly Duelist, fencing with twin blades and blurring the line between dance and death.\nNew Enemies include Drowned Dead, lost explorers that rise up from the watery depths to take their revenge on the living, Serpentmen Archers, keeping their distance to fire a deadly volley of Dark Stone arrows at the Heroes, Temple Guard, a new breed of brutish Serpentmen that defend the temples of the Serpent Kings with savage ferosity, and the mighty Croxin Beast, a massive reptilian creature unleashed by the Serpentmen as a beast of war!\nThis set also features brand new material for the Swamps of Jargono  OtherWorld (first introduced in the Swamps of Death Core Set), a murky jungle swamp filled with giant insects, carnivorous plants, and vicious Serpentmen. The Heroes will explore a new region of Jargono - the Valley of the Serpent Kings, with new Map Tiles, Encounters, Artifacts, World abilities, and Enemies to battle, letting you explore the Swamps for the first time, or expanding your existing collection.\n\n\nNote - Final contents may vary from those shown here.\n\nGates of Valhalla\n       In Gates of Valhalla, players take on the role of a group of Norse Vikings, exploring the icy crags and snowy forests of the Norse Lands  filled with snarling beasts and mythological creatures  emboldened by the power of the Dark Stone.\nAs a Team of Viking Heroes, you can play as the stalwart Jarl  Chieftan, leading his clan from the front of the pack, the classic Raider, armed with shield and axe to pillage and plunder, the frenzied Berserker, unleashing his bloodthirsty Rage in a flurry of death, or the Huscarl honor guard, firing her Viking Bow before charging valiantly into the fray.\nNew Enemies include Trolls, beastly creatures that regenerate even the most grievous of wounds while hurling large stones and tearing at the Heroes with brutal claws, Gremians, a horde of mischievous little goblins that swarm the Heroes to slice and slash and claw and bite, Centurions, robotic soldiers armed with power swords and shields to fight off intruders, and the terrifying Frost Giant, a towering behemoth that smashes the Heroes with his tree trunk club before charging across the field of battle in a frothing frenzy!\nThis set also features brand new material for the Targa Plateau OtherWorld (first introduced in the City of the Ancients Core Set), an ancient alien city, frozen and abandoned for millennia save for the robotic constructs that awaken to defend the icy halls. The Heroes will explore a new region of Targa - The Library, with new Map Tiles, Encounters, Artifacts, World abilities, and Enemies to battle, letting you explore the frozen city for the first time, or expanding your existing collection.\n\n\nGame Features\nEach Adventure Set includes the following:\nA Set of beautifully detailed, multi piece hard plastic, 32mm scale game miniatures for the Heroes and Enemies, each designed with dynamic poses and detail perfect for painting. Gates of Valhalla contains 26 miniatures and Valley of the Serpent Kings contains 20 Miniatures, of various sizes.\nImmersive adventures and story driven gameplay, using the expansive and popular Shadows of Brimstone\u2122 Game Engine.\nFully Cooperative, with all of the players working together against the game itself\nDynamically generated adventures, 8 different Missions, and 4 unique Heroes with many options for customization, the game is designed for massive replayability.\nEasy to learn with simple but fun gameplay and rewarding thematic story moments as you progress your Heroes.\nBuilt-in Campaign system for keeping your Hero characters from game to game, finding new items on your adventures and gaining new skills and abilities as you go up in level.\nHeroes can visit their Expedition Camp Site between missions to re-stock and re-supply before the next adventure, having a mini-adventure in camp.\nDouble-sided Map Tiles include an Earth-based World on one side (Norse Lands or Spanish Fort) and an OtherWorld on the back side for the Heroes to explore; stepping through a shimmering portal and continuing their adventures in an alien world of crumbling ruins and terrifying monsters.\nOver 170 game cards, a set of beautifully illustrated, double-sided Map Tiles, a host of dice and counters, and all of the large Hero and Enemy record sheets needed to play.\n\n    Either of these Shadows of Brimstone Adventures Sets can be played on its own as a stand-alone game, or it can be used in combination with any and all of the other Shadows of Brimstone products already available! It is fully compatible, in every way! For new players, these Adventures Sets will make a great introduction to the world of Shadows of Brimstone, and for veteran players, they add a ton of new content, including brand new Worlds to explore - the Norse Lands and Targa Plateau - The Library in Gates of Valhalla, and the Spanish Fort and Swamps of Jargono - Valley of the Serpent Kings in Valley of the Serpent Kings. They also include brand new sets of Heroes and Enemies to add to your games.With all of the Shadows of Brimstone material available, the possibilities are endless!\n\n\n\nWhat is Shadows of Brimstone?\nShadows of Brimstone\u2122  is a fully cooperative, dungeon crawl, adventure game, where a group of courageous Heroes explore a world overrun with unspeakable horrors. First appearing as a wildly successful Kickstarter campaign in 2013, the original Shadows of Brimstone\u2122 Core boxes were set in the Old West. In 2016, the Forbidden Fortress\u2122 Core box appeared as a second Kickstarter campaign, introducing elements of Feudal Japan to the Shadows of Brimstone game series.\nThe  game supports 1-4 players (or up to 5-6 players with additional Heroes), has a standard game time of 2-3 hours, and includes a campaign system for keeping your Hero characters from game to game, finding new items on your adventures and gaining new skills and abilities as you go up in level. You can also visit a settlement between adventures to re-stock and re-supply before setting out on  your next mission, and during the game, you can find the swirling portals that the terrifying enemies are coming from, and you can step through those gateways to continue your adventures on the other side, in another dimension or alien world. The map tiles are all double-sided, with the Earth-based environment on one side and an alien world on the other side.\nOne of the main features of Shadows of Brimstone\u2122  is that all of the players work together against the game itself, and that everything is card-based and dynamically generated as you play (the encounters, enemies, board layout, etc.), meaning that the game never plays the same way twice.\n\n\n\nTeam Heroes\n   With the new Team Hero Classes introduced in these Brimstone Adventure Sets, all of the Heroes of the same Hero Class (Conquistador or Viking) share the same basic set of abilities, but each player chooses which of the 4 starting Upgrades for that Hero Class to use, giving them a Sub-Class - A Conquistador  may be an Explorer, Duelist, El Capitan, or Soldier; while a Viking may be a Jarl chieftan, Raider, Berserker, or Huscarl. This defines your basic character stats - how much Health and Sanity you have, how good you are at hitting enemies with your weapons, how good you are at solving puzzles or dodging fiendish traps, etc. It also gives you a unique starting ability and defines your basic starting Gear - do you start with a War Axe, a shield and sword, Dueling Blades? Each Hero also starts with a Random Personal Item that gives them a bit more \u2018character\u2019.\nOne other exciting element to the new Team Heroes is the Team Hero Abilities deck. At the start of each Adventure, the players draw one card from the Viking Team Abilities deck for each Viking Hero in the party, and adds it to a shared pool of cards. Each of these cards is a special ability that can be used once during the Adventure, and generally gives all Heroes of that type a bonus.  You must choose as a team when best to use them. In this way, the more Vikings you have on a team, the more Team Ability cards you get to draw at the start of each Adventure to help all Viking Heroes! This works the same way for the Conquistadors, and allows for thematic and heroic teamwork between all the characters in the Hero Party that are of the same Hero Class.\n\n\nKickstarter Exclusives\nThere are two Kickstarter Exclusive Hero Classes created for this campaign, as well as a Kickstarter Exclusive Team Hero Expansion.\nAs part of the Wolf Pledge Level, a backer will get the KS Exclusive Valkyrie Hero Class.\nAs part of the Lion Pledge Level, a backer will get the KS Exclusive Cursed Eternal Hero Class.\nThe Explorer Pledge Level includes BOTH the KS Exclusive Cursed Eternaland Valkyrie Hero Classes.\nAs part of the Warlord Pledge Level, a backer will get BOTH the Valkyrie and Cursed Eternal KS Exclusive Hero Classes, AS WELL AS the KS Exclusive Trederran Strike Team Expansion.\n\nValkyrie \u2013 Riding down from the sky on a winged steed, the death dealing Valkyrie is a warrior maiden in the service of Odin himself, the god of war! Though their numbers are few next to the hordes of beasts and demons that have overrun the land now tainted by the void energies of the Dark Stone, the Valkyries have come to help defend the lands of mortal men from the encroaching Darkness. \n\nCursed Eternal \u2013 One of the twelve crew of Ponce De Leon that explored the wilds to discover the Fountain of Youth, the Cursed Eternals succeeded in their quest for immortality, but at a grim cost. By drinking the Fountain's water, they were granted eternal life, but live out their days in a constant state of withering away, gaunt and pale. Only by cutting down Enemies with his tainted Ghost Blade, and stealing the life essence from his foes, can the Cursed Eternal hold his deterioration at bay.\nTrederran Strike Team Expansion \u2013 The Trederran Strike Team is an elite fighting squad of alien special forces soldiers, deployed on dangerous missions by the High Command of their Trederran Nation. This Expansion includes the new Trederran Team Heroes, with 4 unique types of Trederrans to play as - the Sergeant, leading the team with grim determination, the Legionnaire, an elite soldier pulled from the front lines, the Specialist, a master in using the various Weapons of War, and the Engineer, a demolitions and tech expert. This allows players to take on the role of a team of alien Anti-Heroes for the first time.\nThis Expansion includes all of the Heroes, Miniatures, and cards needed to play as a Trederran Strike Team, including Trederran Personal Items, Starting Gear, Upgrades and Skill Tree, Trederran Faction cards that let you choose the Nation your team is fighting for (or if you want to have a combined Strike Team from different Nations, coming together for a unified goal), Team Ability cards (with unqiue Team Abilities for each of the 6 major Trederran Nations), Encounters unique to playing as Trederrans, and 6 new Missions, allowing your Strike Team to venture into other worlds on raids for Dark Stone or resources, to set up toxic gas generators, assassinate a target, or even deploy a dreaded Doomsday Device!\n\n\nStretch Goals\n    There are 3 types of Stretch Goals that can be unlocked during the course of this Kickstarter campaign: Wolf Level Stretch Goals (marked with the Wolf Icon), Lion Level Stretch Goals (marked with the Lion Icon), and Warlord Level Stretch Goals (marked with the Warlord Icon).\nWolf and Lion Level Pledges will each receive only the Stretch Goals marked with their unique Icon (Wolf Icon or Lion Icon), while Warlord Level Pledges will receive all of the Stretch Goals marked with the Wolf, Lion, and Warlord Icons.\n\n\nGame Miniatures\nThe Miniatures included in Shadows of Brimstone: Gates of Valhalla  and Shadows of Brimstone: Valley of the Serpent Kings  are multi-part HIPS hard plastic. They come on frames and do require some assembly. We have taken great care to make the assembly in as few pieces per model as possible, while still getting a high level of detail and fantastic, dynamic poses. This also brings an aspect of Hobby to the game as many players find it fun to customize and paint their figures.\n\nHow Does the Game Play?\nShadows of Brimstone is a fully-cooperative, Dungeon Crawl adventure game! That means that all of the players form a Hero team (or you can play solo) and are working together against the game itself. You set out on your expeditions exploring a torch-lit Spanish Fort that has been overrun with creatures and demons, or the snowy forests of the Norse Lands, filled with mythological beasts!  The team can take on different missions from the Adventure Book, each with unique set up and victory conditions. You may be searching for a sacred artifact, stolen from a nearby settlement by demons and carried off into the darkness, or you might be tasked with sealing off portals that unspeakable creatures are pouring out of!\n1-4 Players (or up to 5-6 Players if Adventure Sets are combined together or with additional Hero Expansions) create their Heroes by selecting a Hero Class and Starting Upgrade to play, such as the Conquistador Explorer or Viking Raider.\nOnce your team is ready to go, the players roll (or decide) what Mission they have taken on and the game begins! Each Hero is represented by a figure on the game board and all of the figures are placed on the Fortress Entrance Map Tile to start the game. All of the Card Decks are shuffled, each Hero gets 1 Grit Token, and the Depth Track is setup with the Hero Party\u2019s marker on the entrance and the Darkness marker deep in the shadows (at the opposite end of the track). Players then draw their Team Ability cards to add to their shared pool for the Hero Party.\nAt the start of each turn, the Hero with the Light Source (Lantern or Torch) rolls 2 dice to Hold Back the Darkness! This roll needs to be equal to or greater than the number listed on the current stage of the Depth Track. If the roll is passed, the Heroes carry on without delay. If the roll is failed, the Darkness moves one step up the track toward escaping from the shadows! But beware, if the Darkness marker ever reaches the entrance space on the Depth Track, it has escaped, and the mission is failed. As an added element of danger, if the Hold Back the Darkness roll is ever doubles (1-1, 3-3, etc), this instead triggers a random event from the Depth Event Chart equal to that number!\nHeroes now Activate in order of Initiative, with the highest going first. During a Hero\u2019s Activation, they roll a die and may move up to the amount rolled. If a 1 is rolled, the Hero also recovers an extra Grit Token. Grit Tokens are used for a number of things in game. A Grit Token may be discarded to Re-roll any number of your dice just rolled (though a die may generally not be Re-rolled more than once), or a Grit Token may be discarded to move an extra die roll worth of spaces during your Movement. A Grit Token may also be used to activate certain powerful character abilities.\n\nAfter moving, a Hero may attack if there are any Enemies on the board, or if not in a Fight, they may Explore by either Scavenging the area for anything of value (rolling 3 dice and drawing a card from the Scavenge deck for each 6 rolled), or Looking Through a Doorway, if standing on an open exit of a Map Tile. To Look Though a Doorway, you must be in one of the puzzle-cut half spaces of an open exit from the map tile you are on. You may look down the hall and draw a random Map Card to place the next Map Tile, connecting it to the doorway you are looking through. Each time a new Map Tile is placed, you must also move the Hero Party\u2019s marker one step forward on the Depth Track, as the Hero Team delves deeper into the unknown. This is important because as the Heroes go deeper into the shadows, it becomes harder and harder to Hold Back the Darkness (the number required to roll gets higher, the deeper the Hero Party has gone).\nNewly placed Map Tiles are always either a Room or a Passage. Passage Tiles have open doorways on all ends and can often split the path in front of the Heroes. They do not, however, contain Encounters for the Heroes to deal with. Room Tiles, on the other hand, always come into play with an Exploration Token on them. As long as there is an unrevealed Exploration Token on a Map Tile, Heroes may not Scavenge or Look Through a Doorway on that Map Tile (you can\u2019t explore further than that room with the unrevealed token). At the end of a full Turn (after all Heroes have been Activated), if there are one or more Heroes in a Room with an Exploration Token, that token is revealed!\nWhile exploring, Heroes can find large, swirling portals that the Enemies are coming through to attack, and they can step through those gateways into a crazy alien World, continuing their adventures on the other side! All of the Map Tiles are double-sided, with the Earth-based world on one side and an alien OtherWorld on the back side. In Gates of Valhalla, the alien World included is the Targa Plateau - Library! In Valley of the Serpent Kings, the OtherWorld is the Swamps of Jargono - Valley of the Serpent Kings. Stepping through the portal, the Heroes find themselves in the halls of a dark archive deep within a frozen ancient alien city, or the sprawling tribal temples and crumbling stone ruins covered in vines and sunken into the water of the murky swamps.\nOnce the Heroes have reached their objective for the mission being played, they will often have one final Epic battle with an Enemy boss to complete the Adventure!\nBetween Adventures, the Heroes can travel back to their Expedition Camp to re-stock and re-supply, having a mini-Adventure in Camp before setting out on the next Mission. \nShadows of Brimstone has a built in campaign system allowing the players to keep their Heroes from game to game, finding cool new Gear and Artifacts that they can use in their continuing Adventures, while gaining experience and going up in level to unlock new skills chosen from their Class-Specific Skill Tree.\n\n\nShipping\nThis project is US, EU, Canada, UK, and Australia Friendly Shipping!\nOur intent is to ship all Pledge Rewards and Stretch Goals for this KS project as a single shipping Wave.\nHowever, all extra Add-On  items (added individually beyond your Pledge Level/Stretch Goals) will  be shipped separately from the main Pledge Rewards/Stretch Goals, and  will  likely ship AFTER the main Pledge Rewards/Stretch Goals.\nExtra Add-on items are US, EU, UK, Canada, and Australia Friendly.  They will be packed and delivered to our distribution centers in the  EU, UK, Canada, and Australia (at our expense) and then shipped to individual Backer addresses from within the EU, UK, Canada, and  Australia for Backers in those regions.\nShipping and handling  charges are not included in the pledge levels. We will be charging shipping after the Kickstarter ends, based on the actual shipping and handling costs.  We will collect this via our pledge manager after the campaign ends. We will ship your rewards (at our cost) to our distribution centers in the  US (in Washington State), Australia, UK, Canada, and the EU. Backers  will then be responsible for shipping charges from the most appropriate distribution center to your address.  \nThe following is a list of rough estimates for shipping a standard game package for the Wolf, Lion, Explorer, and Warlord Pledge Levels.  Keep in mind these are just estimates, and costs may rise based on weight increases from unlocked stretch goals, or fluctuating carrier rates.    \n\nWOLF or LION Level \nUSA: $15-$20 to most states.  \nAustralia: $20-$30\nNew Zealand: $30-$40\nUK: $15-$20 \nEU: $15-$20 to most countries \nOther European Countries outside the EU: $25-$30 \nCanada: $15-$25  \nLatin America: $65-$75  (Mexico $70, Brazil $75.)  \nAsia: $25-$55\nAfrica: $85-95 to most countries.  \n\nEXPLORER Level \nUSA: $20-$30 to most states  \nAustralia: $25-$35\nNew Zealand: $35-$40\nUK: $20-$25\nEU: $20-$25 to most countries \nOther European Countries outside the EU: $35-$40 \nCanada: $20-$35  \nLatin America: $90-$100  (Mexico $90, Brazil $110.)  \nAsia: $35-$80\nAfrica: $130-145 to most countries\n\nWARLORD Level \nUSA: $30-$40 to most states  \nAustralia: $40-$45\nNew Zealand: $45-$50\nUK: $30-$35\nEU: $30-$35 to most countries \nOther European Countries outside the EU: $45-$50 \nCanada: $30-$45  \nLatin America: $105-$115  (Mexico $100, Brazil $130.)  \nAsia: $75-$100\nAfrica: $160-175 to most countries\n\nFor  our international backers, we plan on shipping from our international hubs in the UK/EU, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and Hong Kong.  (USA  backers and ROW will ship from Washington State, USA.)\nWe will do our best to get you your rewards by the estimated shipping date, but any number of things (manufacturing delays, shipping delays, customs, etc.) can get in the way of that.  We cannot promise that you will receive all pledge rewards before some or all of it is available at conventions, online promotions, or retail.  We hope that you will take into consideration that you are getting a better price and exclusives for backing this KS Campaign, but if that is not something you\u2019re okay with, please do not back this project. Thank you for understanding.\nPledges of $25 or more will get access to the Pledge Manager and will be able to upgrade their pledge and add Add-Ons.   Upgrading pledges in the Pledge Manager will be more expensive than it is to back at a pledge level during the campaign.  \nREFUND POLICY\nWe can fully refund your pledge within 14 days of the campaign\u2019s end, including fees.  After that, you may receive a reduced refund, minus Kickstarter fees and other payment processing fees, which may include Pledge Manager fees once the Pledge Manager closes.  Once your package has begun being packed, a refund is no longer possible.\nAll PayPal refunds 14 days or more after the campaign\u2019s end will also have any PayPal fees deducted.\n\n\nFlying Frog Productions\nFlying  Frog Productions, LLC is a premier traditional game company that  focuses on fun, theme-heavy, story driven board games.

We launched our first Kickstarter Campaign in October of 2013 for the original Shadows of Brimstone, and another for Forbidden Fortress in November of 2016. We have been through the process, working out the pipeline and navigating the hurdles. Those projects were enormous, with many moving parts, and logistical challenges. We have learned many lessons from those experiences that will go into making this new Kickstarter project even better! The success of the first Kickstarter campaign allowed us to hire additional staff in our studio and find new manufacturing contacts who can produce higher quality miniatures and components. With the Forbidden Fortress campaign, we streamlined the process and the project went much smoother.\n\nMiniatures \u2013 We have been producing HIPS hard plastic, multi-part figures for over 6 years now, working with several factories to refine the pipeline and process. The results are figures that keep getting better and better detail and quality, both in the tooling of the molds and the sculpting of the figures. The miniatures in these Brimstone Adventures Sets are some of our absolute best to date, and we are very excited for backers to see the level of detail on these figures.\n\nDelivery Timeline \u2013 The original Shadows of Brimstone Kickstarter production and shipping ran very long, but we learned a lot. The Forbidden Fortress Kickstarter production ran a little bit long, but processing and shipping had a very fast turnaround time (we shipped pre-packed boxes directly from China to distribution hubs around the world). We expect the production and shipping of this campaign to go even smoother as we have refined the process.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 25 or more", "title": "Navigator Level", "descp": "You get an exclusive Brimstone Adventures Art Print signed by the Flying Frog Team.

Lang and with art by Adrian Smith is being turned into a full-fledged digital game by Exozet!\nFor $15 the base Digital Viking pledge gets you a copy of the Blood Rage Digital game. This is a special price for backers, as the game will eventually retail for almost twice as much. The Digital game is expected to launch in December 2019, though backers will be able to get access to a Closed Beta much earlier than that. Find out more about the digital game further down the page. \nIf your focus is the analog Blood Rage board game, however, you may be interested in the special $60 Physical Viking Pledge, which gets you not only a free copy of the Blood Rage Digital game, just as explained above, but also a slew of Kickstarter Exclusive promos to use with the Blood Rage board game! This includes new versions of the 4 Monsters only available in the original Kickstarter campaign, the brand-new Stag Clan (including their Mystics and Sculpted Clan Tokens), and also 24 Cards to add a 5th Player into the board game! \nThrough Stretch Goals this pledge level has been further enhanced with the addition of 3 brand new Monsters, 3 Sculpted Tokens, and 7 Golden Gods of Asgard, including the new Hel.\nWhile the Blood Rage Digital game is set to launch in December 2019, the physical promo items are expected to be delivered to backers beforehand, around August 2019.  \nFind out more about these Optional Purchases in the following links: Blood Rage Core Box, Playmat Board, Mystics of Midgard, Deluxe Gods of Asgard, Art Book, Cardboard Clan Dashboards, Sculpted Tokens, and Cardboard Age Track & Valhalla Tiles.\nBlood Rage Digital is set to faithfully recreate the amazing experience of the tabletop game inside your computer, available for both Windows and Mac OS in English, German, French, Italian, and Spanish. The universe of the board game has been recreated and adapted to the digital realm, taking full advantage of this new medium.\nPlease note all screenshots of the digital game are Work In Progress.\nMidgard comes to life.\nThe game will feature stunning visuals set to enhance your viking experience. The Midgard play area is brought to life, with waves crashing against the fjords as the gargantuan World Serpent endlessly circles the blue vastness. Each region has its own climate, topography, trees and villages. And at the center of it all stands a beautiful representation of the great Yggdrasil tree!  \nEach region has its own unique look.\nSome of the game's 3D assets.\nNetwork play will allow up to 4 people to play together, choosing their clans and battling for glory. Alternatively, the single-player mode will pit your wits against cunning AI opponents, with several different personalities/strategies you can choose from to experience different challenges. You can even mix things up, with both virtual and real opponents joining the fray.\nChoose your cards and join the battle!\nThe interface is slick an intuitive, so veterans and newcomers alike will be pillaging in no time, with the aid of tutorials and easily-accessible rules references. \nA region destroyed by Ragnar\u00f6k.\nSince Blood Rage first launched on Kickstarter back in 2015, it has solidified its place in the pantheon of must-have modern board games. However, since the vast majority of Blood Rage fans didn't discover the game until well after that initial campaign was over, they never had a chance to get the exclusive promos it contained. With this campaign for the Digital version of the game, we thought it would be a great opportunity to right that wrong. While the original promos will remain exclusive to that campaign, we've created alternate versions of them exclusively for the Physical Viking Pledge, with new names, art, and sculpts, but retaining the same gameplay characteristics.\nPlease note that to play with these promos, you will require a Blood Rage core box (for sale in retail).\nThe proud Stag Clan shows that viking women are every bit as fierce as the men. This set not only adds more diversity to your games, complete with sculpted Clan Tokens and Mystic figures (requires the Mystics of Midgard expansion to use), but it also comes with 8 extra cards for each Age, so that the board game can be played with 5 players! \nThe Stag Clan comes with everything you need to add it to your board game, expanding it to 5 players:\n1 Leader Figure\n8 Warrior Figures (featuring 2 different sculpts)\n2 Mystic Figures\n1 Ship Figure\n4 Sculpted Clan Tokens\n1 Glory Marker\n13 Small Colored Bases\n2 Large Colored Bases\n1 Clan Dashboard\n1 Mystic Reference Card\n24 5-Players Cards (8 for each Age)\nThe Golden Gods of Asgard is an exclusive deluxe version of the classic expansion, where the gods occupy different provinces, affecting the basic rules of the game and creating unique dynamics to each session of the game. The deluxe version includes resculpted, oversized, golden figures for each of the original gods, as well as Hel, a brand-new God of Asgard to carry on the original game effect of Hili, a previously released exclusive promo.\nNote that anything marked with this:\nis an exclusive  item for Kickstarter backers (or from other crowdfunding platforms), with remaining stock available through conventions and special promotions only. \nPlease Take Note!\nThe Blood Rage Digital game will be distributed via Steam, by supplying backers with an access code, so there is no shipping cost involved for the Digital Viking pledge. However, note that any Optional Purchase added to the Digital Viking pledge will be shipped from our hubs normally, so shipping costs will be charged. Regardless of what is added to the pledge (if anything) the confirmation of the pledge will still be handled via the Pledge Manager after the campaign ends.\nFor the Physical Viking pledge, we will be charging shipping after the Kickstarter concludes based on the actual costs incurred to ship. We will collect this via our pledge manager after the campaign ends, using PayPal. This is so we can be fair to all our backers as shipping is rarely one size fits all.\nWe will ship your rewards at our cost to our international hubs. Depending on where in the world you are, we will either ship to you from our hub in the UK (EU backers), China (Asia Pacific backers), Singapore (Singaporean backers), Canada (Canadian backers), Australia (Australia and New Zealand backers) or Atlanta (USA and the rest of the world). Following is a list of rough estimates for shipping a Physical Viking Pledge. Keep in mind these are just estimates of the average cost per destination and actual costs may change in the pledge manager, specially if anything is added to your pledge.\nUSA: $10-$15 to most states. $30 to Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico.\nCANADA: $15-$30 to most cities.\nLATIN AMERICA: $30-$40 to most countries.\nASIA: $10 to China, Hong Kong, and Singapore. $25 to most other countries (we can\u2019t predict an estimate cost to Malaysia). Backers in China, please read THIS UPDATE.\nOCEANIA: $20-$35 to Australia. $30 to New Zealand.\nAFRICA: $40 to most countries.\nEUROPE: $20-$30 to most countries.\n\u2022 $35 to Norway, Switzerland, Finland, Estonia, and Latvia.\n\u2022 $50 to Bosnia/Herzegowina, Croatia, and Iceland.\n\u2022 $40 to Israel, Liechtenstein, and Serbia\n\u2022 $40 to Belarus.\nUnfortunately, different import laws and customs have made it impossible for CMON to ship games to certain specific countries.\n*WE DO NOT SHIP TO:* Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Afghanistan.\nPlease note that while we do our best to get you your rewards in a timely manner, you may not necessarily receive your rewards before the product makes it into distribution in your own country or before it's made available in conventions and special promotion opportunities. We hope that the special price and exclusive items you will get during the Kickstarter will make up for any such possible lag. However, if this is something that is not acceptable to you, please do not back this project, and instead wait for the retail release. Thank you for your understanding. \nBe aware that all pledges that are confirmed after the pledge manager deadline will be shipped from the US hub at a later date. For non-US backers that will likely incur increased shipping costs and import taxes. We also cannot ship to PO Boxes domestically or internationally. Due to the size of each package there is too great a risk of the package being bounced back to us.\nThe table below gives you a general idea of the full schedule of what to expect once the campaign ends. Keep in mind these are just estimates, and the timeline may vary due to circumstances.\nTo learn about Retail Pledges click HERE.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our 35th Kickstarter, and there are some vagaries in terms of timing when it comes to anything produced in China, such as: \nProduction delays \nShipping delays \nCustoms delays\n\nThe estimated delivery date for this project is December 2019, but keep in mind this is only an estimate. Also, due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others.\n\nWe've done our best to minimize this as much as possible, and we are always happy to refund pledges if for some totally unforeseen reason the game can't be delivered at all.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nWe can refund you within 14 days of the campaign\u2019s end, fees included. After that, we have a policy of no questions asked, though that\u2019s minus Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we can\u2019t get back from them after 14 days). However, if we\u2019ve begun packaging your pledge for shipment, no refunds are possible. If a component cannot be delivered AT ALL, we refund that completely, including fees.\n\nAll refunds after the 14 days close of the campaign may be processed via Paypal or reversed via Stripe to your credit card at our discretion. Refunds within 14 days are reversed via Stripe to your credit card.\n\nThis project is being funded in USD and any refunds processed will be in USD for the exact amount received in USD, excluding any applicable fees depending on the time of the refund being processed.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look, materials and content of the rewards (and the project) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented while the Kickstarter project was active.\n\nIf you do not log in and confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email to confirm your pledge, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received. However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your pledge if you contact us and confirm your pledge after the 8 week window has elapsed. Unconfirmed pledges make it difficult for us to plan production and logistics, and in the past have led to project delays. For this project we do not intend to allow this to happen, which may mean if you confirm your pledge too late, exclusive items may not be produced in sufficient quantity for your pledge.\n\nIf you confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods.

Dark water suddenly rose from the land, invading our homes and lives. They say it came from the depths inside the Loop. Whatever it was the Flood changed everything. Nothing would ever be the same again.\nWelcome back to the Loop. Things are different now. \nIn 2017, we released Tales from the Loop the tabletop roleplaying game based on St\u00e5lenhag\u2019s first art book. That game was an instant hit, selling out its two initial print runs and winning no less than five ENnies (including Best Game and Product of the Year) as well as three Golden Geek Awards (including Best RPG).\nNow, it\u2019s time to return to the Loop and continue the story. In Things from the Flood you play Teens in the 1990s \u2013 a decade of change and disaster. You're still balancing day to day life with solving exciting mysteries with your friends. But this is a darker time, and the stakes are higher.\nWe are the Free League, creators and publishers of roleplaying games such as Mutant: Year Zero, Coriolis - The Third Horizon, Tales from the Loop and Forbidden Lands. As well as the original publishers of Simon St\u00e5lenhag\u2019s art books. The lead writer of this book is the seasoned Swedish game writer Nils Hintze, backed up by the entire Free League team who handle project management, editing, and graphic design. \nThe vast majority of the art in the game is done by Simon St\u00e5lenhag himself. Most of the art will be drawn from the pages of the Things from the Flood artbook - many scenarios in the game are based directly on illustrations in the artbook - but the RPG will contain some new original art as well, including the cover image.\nThe book will have approximately 200 pages, in the US Letter format.\nTales from the Loop Backer? If you backed the original Tales from the Loop RPG back in late 2016, you will get a PDF of the Things from the Flood core book, including the digital stretch goals in this Kickstarter, at no extra cost. You can still join this Kickstarter to get the printed book.\nThings are different now. \nThe world does not seem so innocent anymore. \nIts the \u201890s and the once mighty Loop has been shut down, the experiment abandonded and the land bought by Krafta, a powerful corporation. You are no Kids anymore, but Teens trying to find your way in a decade of change \u2013 both within and around you. \nThe Flood has transformed the once pastoral islands into a dark marshland. Some say that the dark water pouring out of the ground comes from within the Loop itself. Machines are afflicted by a strange virus turning them unreliable and dangerous. \nStill, your lives go on as before. You go to school, fall miserably in love, try to do everything possible to fend off boredom. When you hear about other teens going missing, and even turning up dead, you realize its time to gather the group again.\nOne way or another you fill find out what these Things from the Flood really are. \nYou play Teens growing up in the 1990s, trying to balance everyday life while at the same time solving dark mysteries together with your friends. \nThe core of the game is the same as in Tales from the Loop, but the themes are different. Gone are the childlike tales of wonder and discovery, in their place are dark threats to the Teens and their world. Everything is changing, everything is falling apart. Figuring out how to deal with this is a big part of the game. \nYou are no kid anymore, the world is both more exciting and more dangerous. Teenagers can get hurt \u2013 and even die. The stakes are higher than ever.\nBoth! Things from the Flood expands the scope of Tales from the Loop to the 1990s. You can continue your campaign with the Kids from the original game or create brand new player characters. We call it a \"standalone expansion\" because everything that is needed to play the game is included in the book. That\u2019s right, no previous experience is needed at all, just get the book and start playing right away.\nIf you\u2019ve read and played the Tales from the Loop RPG, you will find yourself right at home, this book expands the setting and introduces new exciting mysteries and threats to explore. \nThe game engine of Things from the Flood is the same as the one for Tales from the Loop RPG and is based on our previous game Mutant: Year Zero, that was awarded with a Silver ENnie for Best Rules at Gencon 2015.\nThe core mechanic is the same: To make a skill roll, you simply grab a number of dice for your attribute score, skill level and gear, and roll them all together. You need at least one six to succeed, and extra sixes can give you stunts and other bonus effects.\nThings from the Flood will be available in two languages: English and Swedish. The Swedish title of the game will be Flodsk\u00f6rden and you will be able to choose your preferred language in the pledge manager once the Kickstarter has concluded.\nWith your help, we can make Things from the Flood even more amazing.

Simon St\u00e5lenhag is best known for his highly imaginative images and stories portraying illusive sci-fi phenomena in mundane, hyper-realistic Scandinavian landscapes (expanded into America in his latest book The Electric State). Tales from the Loop was ranked by The Guardian as one of the \u201c10 Best Dystopias,\u201d in the company of works such as Franz Kafka\u2019s The Trial and Andrew Niccol\u2019s Gattaca.\nNot only have St\u00e5lenhag\u2019s unique and cinematic images earned him a worldwide fan base, but have also made him a go-to storyteller, concept artist and illustrator for both the film and computer gaming industry. This year it was announced that The Electric State will be turned into a major motion picture and Amazon Prime ordered a full season of a TV show based on Tales from the Loop.\nDuring his twelve years as a game writer, Nils Hintze has written a great number of scenarios, articles and reviews, as well as being the main author of critically praised and award winning Tales from the Loop roleplaying game.

The conflicts in his games are often built on personal dilemmas, where thrill and mystery is not seldom mixed with humor.\nNils is educated in creative writing, but he normally works as a psychologist. Nils is also one of the three creators of the Swedish role-playing podcast Podcon.\nFree League Publishing is the international name of Swedish game and book publisher Fria Ligan AB.

(This is your chance to participate in this celebration!) \nMissed the campaign? You can enter our Late Pledge Manager by clicking the above image. The Late Pledge Manager opens May 8th, and supplies are limited.\nNow the whole Street Fighter Universe is literally at your fingertips! What are you waiting for?!  \nHelp Ryu on his journey to surpass all Stretch Goals! Each one we unlock is added to your pledge for Free! We've planned for 12 additional fighters & battle decks to be unlocked during the campaign! With all those unlocked you get TRIPLE the size of a Base Pledge at the Street Fighter Level!\nWe wanted to make our miniatures so good that even if you didn't play the game at all, your pledge would still be fully worth it for these impressive works of art alone - and at their Collectors Scale, they are wonderful pieces to display around your home or office!  \nStreet Fighter: The Miniatures Game uses a unique scale, the brand new \"Collector's Scale\"! This giant-sized scale has your models large and in charge from 65mm tall all the way up to 85mm tall on some characters all on a standardized 58mm base! We will be offering this scale for all our future Universal Tactics System Games.   \nThis size offers tons of advantages:\nThe miniatures are more like small collectable statues and makes them great for displaying around the house even if you don't play the game at all!  \nThe larger the mini the better the pre-paint process, our pre-painted miniatures are simply the best the industry can currently offer, rivalling that of action figures and full sized collector statues!  \nPlaying with larger miniatures on a board with 3D terrain gives amazing table presence when you pull this game out at any gathering! You'll be the talk of the town!  \nWe believe its quality over quantity, why have buckets of tiny miniatures if they don't get played packed away in expansion box after expansion box? These miniatures will get a lot of table time as your sole representation on the battlefield!  \nTake a look at our featured miniatures video below!\nLet us get a detailed look at each one of our fighters included in the Core Set!\nAdding a NEW DIMENSION to Street Fighter!  \nDestructible Stage Terrain adds a new exciting element to the Street Fighter experience and it adds a new layer of strategic depth to the game as you attempt to out outmaneuver your opponent and set them up for extra damage!  \nEach round the terrain is reset and the fighter positions swapped as to offer an equal opportunity to both players, plus its just more fun to crash into more stuff. Smart awareness, positioning and baiting your opponent can easily win you the day!  \nHOW TO PLAY THE GAME. IT'S SIMPLE!  \nWe wanted anyone to be able to jump right in and play! So we had to make learning the game simple, but yet still have the depth to please experienced gamers and fighting game fans. This was an extremely challenging task for sure, especially when you consider the game system is built not only for Versus Mode but also Free for All and Team Games, essentially three games in one! However after 2 years of development we've believe we have found the right balance between accessibility, strategy, luck and fun factor!  \nIt's as Simple as.... DRAW. MOVE. FIGHT!\n1. DRAW! - Draw 2 cards from your Battle Deck as you start your turn. Skipping this only for the first turn you take.\n2. MOVE! - Move your character up to their Movement Value in any direction.\n3. FIGHT! - Take 2 Actions in any order and in any amount from these Actions:  MOVE, DRAW, or PLAY A CARD.\nOn defense your choice is even easier but yet still an important tension filled decision. Do you BLOCK or COUNTER-ATTACK?\nBLOCK - Roll two default Battle Dice and apply results vs opponent's attack roll.  You may also discard certain cards with defensive dice values to \"BOOST\" your Block Roll.\n-OR-\nCOUNTER-ATTACK - Play a Counter for a Strike, Special or Projectile, if successful discard opponents card and perform Counter-Attack Ability, usually causing damage during your opponents turn!\nAnd that's how the game works! \nAs you roll your Battle Dice & play your cards you will gain meter results which contribute to your Meter Gauge allowing you to enhance certain attacks or save these for the powerful Super and Ultra Combos that can finish your opponents instantly! Best 2 rounds out of 3 WINS!\n CLICK THE IMAGE BELOW TO DOWNLOAD THE BETA RULEBOOK!\nClick the Image above to Download the BETA Rulebook!\nThe Boss Expansion adds in two extremely powerful Street Fighter Bosses. The power level of these bosses is so immense that other players will need to team-up to defeat them in a near hopeless final battle! Here's what's in the set in more detail!  \nStreet Fighter: The Miniatures Game Boss Expansion includes everything you need to introduce extremely powerful Boss characters. This expansion also includes the Boss Mode game rules in which one player controls the boss in a battle against a team of three rival players! Can you and your friends stop this evil-doer's dastardly plan?  \nBOSS EVENT DECKS  \nEvery Boss comes with a unique Event Deck that can change the battlefield conditions dramatically, forcing the players to cooperate and strategize to deal with the new threat! Each new boss game is a different experience as only 6 to 8 of these events are drawn each game on average!\nBOSS FIGHTER BATTLE DECKS\nIn addition to the Boss Mode, the Boss Expansion includes normal 40-Card Boss-Fighter Decks so that the boss can join in with the rabble and fight on a more even level with their opponents in Versus, Free For All, and Team Modes!\nIf you would like to purchase any of these optional add-on's, please click the \"Manage Your Pledge\" button on this games Kickstarter Page and in the pledge manager add the total amount of the items you'd like to get to your total pledge.

Please enjoy this Documentary detailing the history of the game from the 25th Anniversary!  \nWe view this as a premium product for fans of Street Fighter, tabletop games and collectable products. The costs of manufacturing a game like this are extremely high due to a number of factors including:  \nIndividual \"Collector Sized\" pre-painted special FX's miniatures that are comparable in size to (\"Nintendo Amiibos\") that can retail for around $14.99 each! And we are packing 8 of them into a single box! 24 in the World Warrior Pledge!\nWe have planned at least 12 Stretch Goal Fighter Miniatures and their Battle Decks as unlocks, each one of these are at no cost to our backers! This cuts heavily into our margins and makes offering this many free mini's impossible at Retail! So get them while you can!\nThis game has among the highest number of full sized top quality playing cards in a single tabletop game ever! 428 cards in the Street Fighter Pledge and each new character unlocked in Stretch Goals adds another 40 cards, an extremely expensive and costly inclusion! With all Stretch Goals unlocked and the World Warrior pledge that's over 1,548 cards! A ridiculous amount and again impossible at Retail!\nCountless pieces of professional & unique artwork for each type of attack and event cards in a Character Deck!\nThe only way a game like this is made possible is to sell directly to our passionate backers who are looking for a premium and high-quality product. As lifelong fans of the franchise, we simply wanted to make the best possible game regardless of the cost! So jump in on this exclusive opportunity, you never know how valuable these limited pieces can become in the future!\nIf demand is extremely high we may consider in the far future making a retail version of the game with a lower amount of miniatures, perhaps unpainted and at a smaller scale.\nIf you miss the kickstarter the game may only be available at conventions and direct from Jasco Games in limited quantities.\nDo you want to help spread the word about this exclusive limited edition celebration of Street Fighter?

We will be collecting this via our custom pledge manager system after the campaign ends.  \n          This chart below details estimated shipping prices, be aware that it is possible these prices are not exact, they could go slightly up or down depending on certain factors such as how many stretch goals are unlocked and how heavy the boxes will be by the campaigns end (a good thing!), be prepared!\nUNFORTUNATELY DUE TO LICENSING RESTRICTIONS WE ARE UNABLE TO SHIP TO JAPAN OR ASIA.\nUnited States, Canada: $15 - $25\nEuropean Union, United Kingdom, Australia: $20 - $30\nNew Zealand: $30 - $40\nLatin America, Rest of the World: $55 - $65+  \nPlease keep in mind these are estimates, and the more items you purchase, the more shipping will cost.\n\u00a9CAPCOM.

While the HATE core box initially allowed for up to 4 players to fight through a Chronicle together, more tribes have since been unlocked allowing the game to expand to up to 6 players. Explore the 4 original core Tribes here: Um'Gra, Um'Rak, Um'Kator, and Um'Cal.  \n  Find out more about these Optional Buys in these links: The Mother Prophecy, Tribe of Vore Nash, Tribe of Um'Tull, Tribe of Sarrassa, Battlegrounds of HATE, HATE Art Book, 3D Plastic Plateaus, 3D Plastic Huts, 3D Plastic Trees, Red Dice.\nThe Tyrant - Only a worthy tribe will be led by this legend, all others will cower under his hateful gaze.\nEach battle in the Chronicle has consequences, not only in terms of the control of the land, but also in the tribes that fight for it. Killing your opponent in merciless fashion and reaping all that which the land has to give increases your tribe's Hate and Resources. These then allow your warriors to gain new skills, turning them into ever more formidable killers as the Chronicle progresses. You will also be able to bolster your village, giving your tribe extra abilities and features to use in both short and long term. However, dismemberment and death may also be your fate in the battlefield, and you will also need to carry the burden of that in your struggle for power. \nTribe of Um'Gra - Blood-frenzied maniacs, their recklessness is their greatest strength, though it can often be their weakness.\n  The world of HATE is brutal, and is recommended for mature audiences only. The art of the game depicts acts of extreme violence, as well as nudity. To survive and thrive in this barren wasteland, you'll need to embrace the savagery of not only massacring your enemies, but taking innocents captive, torturing them, and even feasting off their flesh. You've been warned, this is not a world for the faint of heart!\nThe figures that make up the Tribe of Um'Gra.\nEach tribe is composed of 11 characters: 2 Youngbloods, 6 Warriors, 1 Shaman, 1 Champion, and 1 towering Prince. (The last belong to the Varn, a \"higher\" lineage of men, who grew monstrous as the ages passed, by feeding on the lesser kind.) Each of these have different stats and starting skills, offering their own tactical choices in battle.\nThe Character cards show your tribe's initial skills and stats.\n  Tribe of Um'Rak - Hive minded, they move as one, to strike like a horde.\nEach tribe also counts on their own unique deck of 8 Tribe cards that they can employ at different points of the battle, usually by spending gathered Savagery tokens. These cards reinforce each tribe's individual nature by offering powerful bonuses and abilities to outmaneuver your enemies.\nTribe cards can often turn the tide of battle.\n  The figures that make up the Tribe of Um'Rak.\nWhen a player challenges another to battle, they choose among 10 different scenarios to play, depending upon how close they are to conquering the heart of the land. Each scenario contains a different terrain setup, as well as different objectives the attacker and defender must accomplish in order to be victorious, and different rewards they may gain from that.\nTribe of Um'Kator - Jacks of all trades, they are relentless and always prepared for changes in the tide of battle.\nBattles are fast and furious, taking around 40 minutes to play. Players maneuver and activate their characters around the board to crush their enemies and reap rewards. Ganging up on an opponent is a sure way to bring them down, or hinder their attacks. Use terrain to your advantage, holding the high ground to dominate your foes. Pillage huts you find to steal their resources or capture any innocents hiding within (being careful of possible ambushes), and harvest withering trees for the meager resources they may yield.\nThe figures that make up the Tribe of Um'Kator.\nIf you happen be knocked out in battle, though, you had better pray your allies keep your limp body safe so you may live to fight another day. If you're carried off by the enemy, a fate worse than death awaits you (usually followed by death). At the end of a battle, captives are dragged to the villages, where the sadistic choice of whether to torture them to death (to gain Hate) or kill and cook them (to gain Resources) is made.\nTribe of Um'Cal - Fearless berserkers, they leave a trail of blood where they go, even if some of it is their own.\nAt the end of each battle, all Hate and Resources gained by each tribe is tallied in the Chronicle sheet. Every few of these gathered unlocks a milestone, which allows you to upgrade your tribe in several different ways. Resource milestones help you upgrade your village. Your tribe's Village sheet shows the buildings you have, and the ones you can build, as well as upgrade. The more you upgrade your village, the more resourceful your tribe becomes. The Forge offers you several Feats of Savagery that can be activated during a battle by spending Savagery tokens to gain different bonuses. The Hall of Heroes allows you to conscript Mercenaries to your tribe, the Training Grounds allow your characters to learn extra skills, and the Shaman's Hut gives you more control over your Tribe cards. At the end of each battle, you may use your Chiurgeon to heal your warrior's scars, and the bigger your Oven and Torture Pit are, the more enemies you can cook or torture!\nVillage Sheet.\n  The figures that make up the Tribe of Um'Cal.\nMeanwhile, Hate milestones allow you to choose Upgrade cards to add to your characters (those that have proven worthy in battle). These dozens of transparent cards contain a myriad of different skills for you to choose, including 6 of them which are exclusive to your tribe. The character cards are all protected by plastic sleeves, allowing you to simply slide the Upgrade card on top of them. Each character may have up to 4 different skills, becoming a legendary fighter. But be careful, such legends can still be killed and erased from the Chronicle.\nAdding an Upgrade to a Warrior.\n  Mercenaries come in all shapes and sizes, with varied abilities. They have their own goals, but you can force them to join your tribe!\nBeing wounded in battle can have drastic consequences. Any characters knocked down on the battlefield (those lucky enough not to have been dragged off and roasted) must make a roll to determine their fate. They may come out of it unscathed, or suffer a tragic death, but more often than not they'll go on carrying a scar to remind them of their failures. These can range from a mental debilitation, to a gouged eye or torn off limb, with the penalties associated with that. Scars are added to characters similarly to Upgrades, possibly cancelling a skill the warrior possessed!\nAdding a Scar to a Warrior.\n  The Mercenary figures, and the imposing Tyrant.\nOnce the Chronicle is over, how much Hate and Resources you accumulated, as well as the strength of the territories you conquered, will determine who becomes the Tyrant that rules the world, while their enemies cower under their merciless feet!\nExample of an epic battle between 4 Tribes!\nUPDATE: With the Stretch Goals unlocking an extra board and extra components, the game will also allow players to use a set of Optional Rules that introduce, at certain points of the Chronicle, massive battles involving more than 2 players. Form alliances in 2x1 or 2x2 battles, or go crazy in a free-for-all slaughterfest!\nDue to its violent, adult content, we have decided to make it so the entire HATE board game is Kickstarter Exclusive (or other crowdfunding platforms). This means the core box and any of its ancillaries can only be acquired through Kickstarter or other crowdfunding platforms, and will not be made available to stores through normal distribution channels. Limited quantities will be available to retailers who want to make a Retail Pledge to this campaign (see below), but if you're interested in HATE, this campaign is the only guaranteed place to get it.\nThe HATE miniatures are 32mm scale. However, the Princes and other members of the higher race are gigantic figures standing about 75mm tall! The pictures shown in the campaign are of resin copies, while the figures that will come in the game will be high-quality pvc plastic.\nOn the left is a resin figure, and on the right a first test sample of the plastic figure. As you can see, the detail already holds very well, even with improvements still being done to the mold.\nGame Components:\nAt the start of the campaign, the HATE core box includes:\n51 Highly Detailed Miniatures\n1 Game Board\n30 Terrain Tiles\nOver 100 Cardboard Tokens\n32 Tribe Cards\n51 Figure Cards\n88 Transparent Upgrade/Scar Cards\n44 Plastic Card Sleeves\n6 Custom Dice\n13 Counter Bases\n5 Scenario Dashboards\n1 Village Sheet Pad\n1 Chronicle Sheet Pad\n1 Rulebook\n  WIP RULEBOOK - Please note this is not the final version of the rules. This rulebook is still being developed, so rules and graphics are subject to change.\n  For $120 the Tyrant Pledge gets you the Kickstarter Exclusive HATE core box, which is sure to become even more impressive with all the Stretch Goals we hope to unlock and add to it!  \nOur own Eric Lang and Michael Shinall sat down to battle each other and explain to you the basic mechanics of HATE.

We'll sort out what your extra money is going towards after the campaign has closed and we've sent out our Pledge Manager.\n                                                                                            Please Take Note!\nBased on past experience, we will be charging shipping after the Kickstarter concludes based on the actual costs incurred to ship. We will collect this via our pledge manager after the campaign ends. This is so we can be fair to all our backers as shipping is rarely one size fits all, and also give you more stretch goodies and possibly a choice of carrier options.\nWe will ship your rewards at our cost to our international hubs. Depending on where in the world you are, we will either ship to you from our hub in the UK (EU backers), China (Asia Pacific backers), Canada (Canadian backers), Australia (Australia and New Zealand backers) or Atlanta (USA and the rest of the world). Following is a list of rough estimates for shipping a standard game package (4kg volumetric weight). Keep in mind these are just estimates, and costs may rise based on weight increases from unlocked stretch goals and any optional buys you choose.\nUSA: $10-$20 to most states. $50 to Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. \nCANADA: $15-$30 to most cities. \nLATIN AMERICA: $60-$70 to most countries. \nASIA: $10 to China and Hong Kong. $30 to most other countries (we can't predict an estimate cost to Malaysia). \nOCEANIA: $20-$45 to Australia. $40 to New Zealand. \nAFRICA: $80 to most countries. \nEUROPE: $20-$30 to most countries.\n $35 to Norway, Finland, Estonia, and Latvia.\n $40 to Bosnia/Herzegowina, Croatia, and Iceland.\n $60-$70 to Israel, Liechtenstein, and Serbia. \nUnfortunately, different import laws and customs have made it impossible for CMON to ship games to certain specific countries.\n*WE DO NOT SHIP TO:* Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Afghanistan.\nBe aware that all pledges that are confirmed after the pledge manager deadline will be shipped from the US hub at a later date. For non-US backers that will likely incur increased shipping costs. We also cannot ship to PO Boxes domestically or internationally. Due to the size of each package there is too great a risk of the package being bounced back to us.\nThe table below gives you a general idea of the full schedule of what to expect once the campaign ends. Keep in mind these are just estimates, and the timeline may vary due to circumstances.\n  To learn about Retail Pledges click HERE. Keep in mind this will be the only chance for retailers to grab some copies of this game!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our 29th Kickstarter, and there are some vagaries in terms of timing when it comes to anything produced in China, such as: \nProduction delays \nShipping delays \nCustoms delays\n\nThe estimated delivery date is January 2019, but keep in mind this is only an estimate. Also, due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others.\n\nWe've done our best to minimize this as much as possible, and we are always happy to refund pledges if for some totally unforeseen reason the game can't be delivered at all. Since the game is 90% complete, we don't believe this is in the least bit likely. We've successfully delivered Zombicide, Sedition Wars, Guilds of Cadwallon, Zombicide Season 2, Relic Knights, Rivet Wars, Kaosball, Dogs of War, Arcadia Quest, Wrath of Kings, XenoShyft, our Base System, Zombicide Season 3, The World of Smog: On Her Majesty's Service, Rum & Bones, Blood Rage, B-Sieged, Zombicide: Black Plague, The Others, XenoShyft: Dreadmire and Masmorra: Dungeons of Arcadia, Arcadia Quest: Inferno, Rum & Bones: Second Tide, and Massive Darkness. The World of Smog: Rise of Moloch, Rising Sun and wave 1 of Zombicide: Green Horde are on their way to backers.\n\nWe have two ongoing projects currently: wave 2 of Zombicide: Green Horde, and A Song of Ice & Fire: Tabletop Miniatures Game, which are in production.\n\nPlease refer to our individual project pages if you'd like to check the progress there. Each project is entirely independent from each other, has completely different development teams, and has no effect on the production flow or development of HATE.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nWe can refund you within 14 days of the campaign\u2019s end, fees included. After that, we have a policy of no questions asked, though that\u2019s minus Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we can\u2019t get back from them after 14 days). However, if we\u2019ve begun packaging your pledge for shipment (usually 4 to 6 weeks before the actual shipping date), no refunds are possible. If a component cannot be delivered AT ALL, we refund that completely, including fees.\n\nAll refunds after the 14 days close of the campaign may be processed via Paypal or reversed via Stripe to your credit card at our discretion. Refunds within 14 days are reversed via Stripe to your credit card.\n\nThis project is being funded in USD and any refunds processed will be in USD for the exact amount received in USD, excluding any applicable fees depending on the time of the refund being processed.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look, materials and content of the rewards (and the project) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented while the Kickstarter project was active.\n\nIf you do not log in and confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email to confirm your pledge, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received. However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your pledge if you contact us and confirm your pledge after the 8 week window has elapsed. Unconfirmed pledges make it difficult for us to plan production and logistics, and in the past have led to project delays. For this project we do not intend to allow this to happen, which may mean if you confirm your pledge too late, exclusive items may not be produced in sufficient quantity for your pledge.\n\nIf you confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods.

Got an idea for a great title that will conquer the world? Do you have ideas in your drawer or on your computer that are waiting for better times? Yes ... we perfectly understand the situation. Ever since we began having fun, and later working with board games, we\u2019ve been devoting every moment to this great hobby. We test, change, cut and modify. As a publisher (Games Factory) we also get a lot of prototypes. Some of them are readable and carefully crafted, but the vast majority are made in a hurry or without a thought. Young authors often disassemble games from their collection in order to create their prototype. They re-use cards, destroy boards, cut and glue markers. They will often go to DIY stores in search of components that could be used as coins, discs, cubes, and will even go as far as dismantling their mum\u2019s necklaces to get the perfect bits for their prototypes...\nWouldn\u2019t it be nice to have all the necessary components at hand to create a board game? Not to ponder on which game to destroy or which piece of jewellery in mum\u2019s drawer is least valuable, yet will make for the best crystals in your game? We proudly present the Board Game Creative Kit \u2013 a tool that will vastly improve prototype creation!!!\nWhen designing the Board Game Creative Kit we thought of what you might find useful when creating your own game. We can\u2019t provide you with custom carved figurines or fancy metal coins, but we do provide bases for figurines, custom figure shapes and dozens of patterns (which you can cut out and apply to the supplied stock of counters).\nDo you need card stock to create a card game? Here you go! We\u2019ve prepared 220 cards for you! Wooden elements? Sure. More than 200 wooden components of various shapes. Six-sided dice? You can even create your own. Board? Choose between a big and a small one. Even the box in which the components are delivered has been left blank for you to customize and use for your game.\nHere's what you get in the Core Box:\n1 x white box\n6 x different punchboards including 260 tokens in various shapes \n1 x white big board \n1 x white medium board \n4 x player boards \n4 x player screens \n24 x D6 dice (4 different colours) \n24 x plastic pawns (4 different colours)\n60 x small wooden cubes (4 different colours) \n60 x medium wooden cubes (4 different colours)\n40 x medium wooden discs (4 different colours) \n40 x wooden meeples (4 different colours) \n110 x poker size cards \n110 x mini european size cards \n1 x big linen bag \n5 x various wooden components \n12 x plastic bases \n12 x blank dice\n1 x sticker sheet for blank dice (204 stickers) \n12 x zip bags\n1 x sticker sheet with personal details (4 stickers)\n1 x code for digital download (5 various pdf-s)\n1 x 24p. booklet containing publishers' details\n            We don\u2019t know what kind of game you\u2019d like to design ... but we can give you some cool ideas. With every Core Box, we will provide all unlocked PDFs with elements that may be useful to you during creation. Of course, you can also purchase PDFs from us (as an add-on) and try your hand at game design and construction on your own(see our sample PDFs with terrains). The sizes of the prepared templates are adjusted to the size of the tokens and tiles found in the Board Game Creative Kit and add-ons.\n    In the box you will also find something special - a booklet with information about publishers from all over the world who are waiting for your prototype and will be happy to look at your work. From Brazil to Russia; from the United States to Australia. We have collected the most important information about what type of game the publisher expects and how to contact them (with at least the e-mail address of the person who is in charge of receiving prototypes).\n  We've prepared quite a few add-ons to help you enrich your prototype. Are you creating an extremely elaborate card game? You will need extra cards. Need different component dimenon of wooden items! Or maybe you need more card stock? We\u2019ve prepared 8 punchboards, packed with various shapes specifically for you. Want to create a game for more players? Think about adding the 5th & 6th player expansion. Additional elements in different colors will allow you to expand your vision.\n          Board Game Creative Kit is designed by enthusiasts for enthusiasts, people who want to enjoy the creation process. Help us fulfill the dream of waking up the game designer in each and every one of us! All we need is to raise $10,000 for the basic version to see the light of day. However, if we collect more, we will add a whole lot of new items to the basic box.\nWe will unveil Stretch Goals with you in mind - the more of you who want to create, the more elements we will add to the box. Stretch Goals are divided into those that will be included in every Board Game Creative Kit purchased, and those which enhance the Add-ons. Check below to see what we can achieve together.\nUnlocked Stretch Goals\n                        You can unlock more Stretch Goals: \n    All components are manufactured in Poland, in factories which supply companies such as Board & Dice, Egmont, LudiCreations, Pegasus Spiele, Portal Games, Rebel, and many others. \nThe cardboard used for the box and tokens is 1.2mm thick and can be upgraded to 1,5mm (when we achieve that Stretch Goal). We used 130g flat surface paper stock to make the tokens more resistant. Furthermore, you can use most common pens and pencils to draw on this surface. . The wooden components are made of beech wood and have an environmentally friendly coating. The playing cards are made from 250g and can be upgraded to 300g paper (we have a SG for that as well). Their surface is flat (i.e. no canvas finish), which makes it easier to write on them. The two game boards included have a white linen finish on both sides\nAll the other items you will find in the box are of equally high quality. Our goal is for you to create the best, most beautiful and robust prototype. Even the box itself can be used for the prototype. An easily removable sleeve prevents the box from opening accidentally. \nAll components are CE-certified.\n  Games Factory has been running campaigns on Polish crowdfunding portals for over 2 years. We\u2019ve managed to successfully carry out fifteen campaigns, collecting over 1,100,000 PLN (Polish curency). We are the publisher of such games as Roll for the Galaxy, Star Realms, Kingdomino and Dominion, and we have a wide fan base in Poland. It\u2019s time to present our ideas to the World; Board Game Creative Kit is the first of them.\nThis project is backed by an experienced team led by Marcin Ropka who gained valuable experience in such companies as Trefl Card Factory (Krakow) and Portal Games (Gliwice). For many years Marcin, along with Viola Kijowska, has also led a group of testers called Little Compulsive Game Testers, and frequently gives lectures on how to create board games and prototypes. Marcin, together with Viola, is the author of 3 published games (including Alien Artefacts by Portal Games) and dozens of prototypes.\nPiotr Sobieraj, Bartek Samel, Wojtek Rad\u0142owski and Kuba Mann have a lot of experience in the industry, who worked for years for Bard publishing house (the Polish publisher of Carcassonne). In addition, this campaign is supported by Karol G\u00f3rniak and Grzegorz Wac\u0142awczyk \u2013 kind souls with lots of interesting ideas. Wojtek Filarski inspired us with the idea of a perfect tool for board game designers. His endless inspiration and fresh perspective on certain matters has been invaluable in the creation of this and many other campaigns.\nPrinting, production, and preparing for shipping will take place in Poland. It is very important to be able to supervise every step of the production and ensure the best possible quality. That's why fulfilment will be done by companies in Poland.\nThis campaign offers so many add-ons and pledge levels, that we decided to go the extra mile to find the best solution for worldwide shipping. Thus offering shipping for the lowest and most accurate cost possible.

When we have ordered boxes for BGCK, we had to order more than we needed (because of minimum order quantity). Boxes we haven\u2019t used were sent to our warehouse, where they were mistaken with ready-to-sell BGCK. You already know the rest of this story \u2013 few monts later, BGCK were already available for sell in shop in Finland, who specialised itself in selling badstocks and \u201eforgotten\u201d goods from warehouses. Before we found out, they have already sold 300 of 400 copies. Cooperation with them isn\u2019t working very well, since we still haven\u2019t received most important information from them \u2013 whom they have bought BGCK from. We went with our case to the Police about two weeks ago. Right now, we are still waiting for letter of initiation. As soon as we got it, we will share it with you.

Set in the heart of the Palace of Mists, the legendary comic book hero Okko and his traveling companions must hunt down powerful Oni (demons) and thwart their dark conspiracies.\nDuring each game, one of the players will take the role of the Oni and their lackeys as they attempt to achieve their objectives without revealing themselves or being forced to flee by the Heroes.\nMeanwhile, one to four players take on the role of Okko\u2019s legendary band of demon hunters as they carry out their investigation to uncover the identity of the Oni hidden among the palace\u2019s residents.\n          Before you start playing, everyone chooses a Hero, each of whom has their own skills and special abilities.\nA Hero is represented by the following:\nA Miniature which represents the character on the game board.\nA Character card which describes their characteristics (Speed, Might, Defense, Guile, Stamina and Natural Talent).\n A hand of Action cards that allows to use the Hero\u2019s specific skills.\nAn Initiative card is used to determine the order in which the Heroes take their turn. .\nA Mission card that sets a personal goal, which the Hero must attempt to achieve during the game.\n  During the Strategy Phase, each Hero chooses up to two Action cards to use in the coming round. These cards can be used in two different ways:\nAs Secret Technique: The card is placed to the right of their Character card, where it modifies the Hero\u2019s Attributes.\nAs a Special Talent: The card is placed to the left of their Character card, and enables the Hero to perform extraordinary feats.\nOnce each Hero has chosen their Action cards, they determine the order in which they will act by creating a deck of Initiative cards.\n  Around the edges of their Character card, Heroes have 4 Equipment slots to indicate which weapons and equipment they are carrying.\nEach Equipment card has its own characteristics and some may only be carried by characters of one of the 4 unique character classes: Hinin, Ronin, Samurai or Maotsukai.\n  One of the players will take the role of Oni, who has its own objectives. It will attempt to achieve these goals while attempting to prevent being unmasked by the Heroes.\nAs the game progresses, the Oni\u2019s control over the inhabitants of the Palace will become stronger and stronger. The Corruption track records the extent of the Oni\u2019s corrupting influence and the additional abilities its agents gain as a result.\n  The Heroes must investigate every dark recesses if they are to successfully analyze clues, interrogate courtiers and decipher documents scattered throughout the Palace of Mists.\n  At the end of the game, Recollections based on the various events that have occurred during the adventure are placed side-by-side, one after the other, to construct Tikku Memoirs. Each Recollection is worth a number of Victory points:\nIf the Oni or the Heroes managed to achieve a Mission tile objective (4 Victory points).\nIf the Heroes\u2019 accusations have successfully unmasked the Oni (4 Victory points).\nIf the Oni is defeated (2 Victory points).\nIf a Hero accomplishes their Personal mission (1 Victory point).\nOnce you have written the memoirs, it's time to compare the colors of the memoir\u2019s Recollections (blue for Heroes, red for the Oni). The party with the most Victory points, wins the game.\n        Okko Chronicles miniatures are on average 35mm in height. This scale is based on the height to the eyes of an adult human character.\nSome miniatures will be much larger, while others will have smaller proportions, depending on the characters they represent.\nFor us, the quality of the miniatures is a priority and you can expect a level of detail equivalent to those shown here.\n               Click on pictures for more details...https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/359037226/okko-chronicles/posts/2033968\n                                Without further indications, all Stretch Goals will be sent in separate boxes.\nThey are also included in the Ronin pledge.\nOkko is a comic book that chronicles the adventures of a ronin and his companions as they hunt demons and other evil creatures across the continent of the Pajan.\nThe saga is divided into 5 cycles, each inspired by a critical element that sets the tone of the adventure\u2019s narrative: The Cycle of Water, The Cycle of Earth, The Cycle of Air, The Cycle of Fire and The Cycle of Emptiness.\n.\nThe group of oni hunters is made up of the following Heroes:\nAs a venerable monk, Tikku recounts the exploits of his erstwhile companions.\nEspecially for this game, HUB, the author-illustrator of the Okko saga, has produced many new and impressive illustrations, along with several new characters to accompany Okko and his companions in their adventures.\n  If you wish to order more than one copy of the game, it is possible to add as many Ronin (\u20ac75) or Samurai (\u20ac90) pledges as you want.

At the heart of Kilforth is the Sprawl, a huge city where intrepid heroes begin their journey to fame and fortune. Over the coming month, a deadly \u2018gloom\u2019 will descend on the world, through which the heroes must battle to prove their worth, defeat a primordial evil, and save the land from darkness.\nGloom of Kilforth is a game of high fantasy with a gothic edge, where 1-4 players, working individually or together, assume the roles of heroes on a journey through a dark world of magic and peril. They will visit strange places, meet stranger people and defeat powerful enemies in their mission to discover mysterious artefacts and mystical spells. Each player follows their hero\u2019s tale, an epic saga from modest beginnings through to a climactic battle that will decide the fate of the world...\nThis project is divided into three waves, as detailed below.  If you're new to Kilforth, start at Wave 1...\nWave 1 - Gloom of Kilforth New Print\nWave 1 will be delivered in the first half of 2018.  If you missed the game first time around here's your chance to grab the original critically acclaimed Fantasy Quest game like no other - or pick up a spare copy for a friend! Just add \u00a348 to your total pledge.\nThis will be a straight up reprint of the first print run of Gloom of Kilforth including all stretch goals unlocked from the original campaign!!  That's 39 bonus cards, plus a ton of high quality upgraded components.  It will also have the following changes from the original version:\nRaging Vampire Misprint - this card will be corrected to say Influence test instead of Study test.  \nColour Blind-friendly enemy tokens - the 4 purple enemy tokens will become yellow.\nOriginal owners of the game who want these altered components can add them to their pledge to be delivered along with their expansion/s at no extra charge after the campaign in the pledge manager. \nThe rulebook will be receiving updates for clarity too, and will be made available as a free digital download to everyone.\nWave 2 - Three Expansions to choose from...  \nWave 2 will be delivered in the second half of 2018 and consists of the three small box expansions listed below, which you can pick and choose from, or bundle together using one of the pledge tiers to receive all three expansions at a deep discount.\n1. \u2018Encounters\u2019 Expansion Pack + All New Stretch Goals\n\"Gloom of Kilforth: Encounters\" is a 54 card plug-in expansion box that comes with the extra 31 cards from the Stretch Goals for a total of 85 cards!!!\nGloom of Kilforth Encounters is the first official expansion to Gloom of Kilforth: A Fantasy Quest Game, the sell-out Kickstarter smash hit that landed this year. Encounters allows you to add more cards to your encounter and reward decks to enhance the variety and narratives of your adventures in the world of Kilforth - simply shuffle the extra content into your game and you are ready to go. \nTo clarify, this is not the \u2018Touch of Death: A Fantasy Quest Game\u2019 full game stand-alone expansion - we will be Kickstarting that sucker next year. \nAny pledge containing the Encounters expansion will also receive the following brand new Stretch Goals...\n2. \u2018Dark Gloom\u2019 Alternate Art KS Exclusive Expansion Pack!!\nDue to overwhelming demand, this is a small set of 12 duplicate cards that are already in the game but with original artwork that was either a bit too terrifying, or a bit too racy for a PG rating. These are simply duplicates of existing cards but with slightly different art - they are not required for play. If you do purchase them you can either replace your existing copies with them, or just shuffle them into your games along with their existing counterparts.  Dark Gloom is exclusive to Kickstarter.\n3. \u2018Pimp My Gloom\u2019 Upgrade Kit Expansion Pack!!\nAs frequently requested by the community this set of pimped out components will include:\nA bigger velvet bag\nMore Dice - 6 white, 6 black\n16 Race Art Standees, 8 of each gender plus 16 plastic stands\n4 Ancients standees plus 4 plastic stands\nReplacement Larger (tarot-sized 121mm x 70mm) Location cards with black and white Gloom sides\nPlayer Aid cards\n The Optional Add-On...\nWave 3 - \"Touch of Death: A Fantasy Quest Game\" Add On - the stand-alone expansion to Gloom of Kilforth...\nWhat is Touch of Death: A Fantasy Quest Game?\nTouch of Death is a totally optional add-on and stand-alone expansion to Gloom of Kilforth.  In every respect it is the same game as Gloom of Kilforth, but with totally new content: new heroes, new sagas, new ancients, new locations, new encounters, new rewards, etc.  You can either play Gloom of Kilforth, or you can play Touch of Death, OR you can combine both games together to double the amount of content and variety you will have in your games!\nWhy should I back Touch of Death now?  Won't there be another Kickstarter for it anyway?\nTouch of Death is an optional add-on, so please pledge responsibly - this add-on is for the backers who want to make this expansion game happen.  The original backers of Gloom of Kilforth from the first campaign waited nearly 2 years for delivery, so we are doing everything we can to bring that development time right down this time, by taking pre-orders for Touch of Death now.  If you pledge for it now, you will be contributing to the art and development of the game and bringing the delivery date closer.  \nYou are also receiving the deep discount price of \u00a348 against the RRP of \u00a357.  If we do a future Kickstarter for Touch of Death there is no guarantee we will be able to offer Touch of Death for \u00a348 again.\nWhat do I get with Touch of Death?\nTouch of Death contains the same amount of content as Gloom of Kilforth did (before the Stretch Goals from the first campaign were added), and is summarised below.\nSince we have unlocked everything for the Encounters Expansion, all future stretch goals will go into improving Touch of Death.\n234 (poker sized 2.5'' x 3.5'' 63.5mm x 89mm) cards:    \n25 Location cards \n4 Ancient cards \n4 Race cards  \n4 Class cards \n25 Night cards  \n24 Plot cards  \n12 Saga cards (3 for each saga)  \n72 Encounter cards (18 in each of 4 types)  \n64 Reward cards (16 in each of 4 types)  \nYou will also receive the following components:\n32 mini-sized 1.75'' x 2.5'' (44.45mm x 63.5mm) Skill cards  \n1 rule book  \n16 Enemy tokens  \n6 dice  \n4 hero standees  \n1 first hero marker  \n48 loot tokens  \n168 wooden tokens (health, gold, actions, etc.)\nHow do I add funds to my pledge for add-ons?\nSimply go to the main page for the campaign and click \"Manage My Pledge\" - then increase your pledge by the amount you'd like for the add-on you want. Simples. :)\nAll New Art and All New Artists  \nNow that we are scaling up as a company and in order to meet our deadlines we will have an entire team of new and incredibly talented artists with us in order to maintain and deliver the highest standards of quality that you have come to expect from Hall or Nothing Productions.  \nIn Gloom of Kilforth players have 25 days to develop their powers and defeat an evil entity called the Ancient. During daylight, heroes travel Kilforth, overcome encounters, and gather rewards, whilst building an epic story called a saga. Each night the land falls further into gloom, and if time runs out before the Ancient is defeated, Kilforth is engulfed in gloom and the heroes lose the game.  \nGloom of Kilforth can be played competitively, cooperatively, or solo. Solo games are played using the cooperative format, where the solo player can control between 1 and 4 heroes.\nImmersive, original fantasy RPG board game experience  \nGorgeous fantasy world art from lead illustrator Ania Kryczkowska\nEnlist strangers, discover artifacts, complete quests, defeat enemies!\n8 years in development  \nMulti-award nominated game designer  \nBeautiful official sound track, free for all backers  \nCompetitive, Cooperative and Solo play  \nHeroes develop (level up) through their Sagas  \nMany actions to choose from each turn  \nRandom, modular game world and encounters  \n1-4 Players, 45 mins per player  \n300+ cards  \n100s of wooden and cardboard tokens  \nDice based skill checks  \nYou will now be able to order your game in French, German or English in the pledge manager as we work closely with our awesome international partners to bring you multinational GoK:\nNuts Publishing for French \nSchwerkraft-Verlag! for German\nIn Gloom of Kilforth each round (Day) you gain Action points equal to your current HP - you start with 4HP and you can level up to 8HP over the course of the game. Players take turns to play a single action (to reduce downtime). You have these actions to choose from:  \n1. Move to a new location, draw encounter if one isn\u2019t there  \n2. Clear an obstacle to gain some loot  \n3. Search an empty location for an encounter  \n4. Hide, to avoid (or surprise) enemies and nasty weather effects  \n5. Confront an encounter to collect that encounter\u2019s keywords \u2013 explore a place, speak to (or battle) a stranger, defeat a quest  \n6. Rest (in a safe, empty location) to regain 1HP  \n7. Discover a rumour: bring a reward card \u2013 item, ally, spell or title - into play (a pick up and deliver type mechanic)  \n8. Go to Market (in a town) \u2013 purchase and/or sell rewards and rumours and/or healing  \n9. Regale \u2013 use gold and keywords to complete chapters of your ongoing saga and level up your hero  \nThere are also various free actions you can use on your turn such as fighting, evading or running from enemies, teaming up with other players against encounters, using fate to manipulate your successes, using skills/rewards/loot token effects, automatically overcoming encounters with various powers, using abilities to gain extra actions or effects, and assaulting the endgame boss(es).  \nCooperating: heroes can exchange rumours, items, gold, spells and loot with each other whenever they share a location, and in the cooperative game you will need to in order for everyone to complete their Sagas. Heroes can also team up against encounters by combining their attributes for tests, but enemies will fight back against all heroes present with equal ferocity! \nThis is an intensely involved, thematic game taking about 45 minutes per player, that delivers a full RPG experience in one session!\nDownload a copy of the game rules here!\nThere's a full breakdown of components for Gloom of Kilforth in the rulebook above, but to summarise there are dice, hundreds of cards and cardboard tokens, hundreds of wooden pieces, oh actually a picture is easier so here you go:\nWhy does Rolling Solo love Gloom of Kilforth?    \nWhy does One Stop Co-op Shop love Gloom of Kilforth?\nWhy does JoystickzWePlay love Gloom of Kilforth (prototype)?  \nWhy does Ricky Royal love Gloom of Kilforth (prototype)?\n Why do Board To Death love Gloom of Kilforth?\nThis is the first consideration for most of the games I design. In the case of Gloom of Kilforth it was hugely important for me, not least of all because it would allow me to extensively play-test the game when no one else was available. But also because I was raised on Fighting Fantasy gamebooks and other Interactive Literature, and also board games and even role-playing games which I could play alone after my friends had gone home or when no one was available. Developing a compelling narrative for a single hero was a massive goal for me whilst also scaling out that experience to the multiplayer game, which took some juggling, but which is why this game offers solo, competitive and cooperative play. Don\u2019t just take my word for it, there are plenty of solo session reports from play-testers which indicate just how immersive the single player experience can be:\nhttps://boardgamegeek.com/thread/698434/some-days-everything-goes-your-way\nhttps://boardgamegeek.com/thread/697845/solo-game-demon-wizard-live-tell\nSuper talented pianist and composer Francesca L Hall has developed a piano sound track inspired by the themes of the game, which in turn inspired the designer of the game!

After his fanmade scenarios and mods for The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game and the Dungeons & Dragons Adventure System games received tens of thousands of downloads Tristan launched his own epic fantasy adventure game Gloom of Kilforth: A Fantasy Quest Game, which successfully funded on Kickstarter, followed by the equally successful 1066, Tears to Many Mothers. He also hosts the gaming podcast #BoardChitless, devoted to Chit Chat about gaming and interviews with the biggest names in the industry.\nFrancesca L Hall: Having played the piano since the age of four, Francesca has composed numerous soundtracks including short films exhibited at Raindance, Edinburgh and Cannes film festivals, and the award winning film 'Detention'. Her second piano album Lost has been received to critical acclaim, and following her incredible sound track to Gloom of Kilforth: A Fantasy Quest Game, Francesca has now experimented with new and authentic sounds mixed with ambient atmospherics to deliver another beautiful audio soundscape for 1066, Tears to Many Mothers.\nFollow us on social media here:  \nfacebook.com/gloomofkilforth  \ntwitter.com/ninjadorg  \ninstagram.com/ninjadorg  \nyoutube.com/tristanhallrocks\nPlease note that shipping will be charged after the campaign!\nAs with the original Gloom of Kilforth Kickstarter and given their excellent track record on that campaign, our good friends at GamesQuest will be handling shipping along with our international partners worldwide. Shipping will be charged after the campaign, and individually based on your location and the expansion selections you made.  In our past experience shipping has tended to be around \u00a37-\u00a316 depending on your location, with UK shipping being cheaper.  For one copy of Gloom of Kilforth for example our previous costs were roughly:\nUK = \u00a37 \nUS = \u00a39 \nEU = \u00a310 \nCanada = \u00a311 \nRest of World = \u00a316\nWe also now have the experience and contacts to work with local distribution centres to bring the costs of shipping down as much as possible.\nIf you backed for Gloom of Kilforth (Wave 1) AND any of the expansions (Wave 2), in the pledge manager you will have the option to have Gloom of Kilforth shipped to you before the expansions, OR wait and have everything shipped to you at once at a reduced rate.\nif you have a passing interest in the continuing slate of scheduled projects for Hall or Nothing Productions here's a very rough guideline:  \n1066, Tears to Many Mothers - production underway  \nLifeform  \nTouch of Death: A Fantasy Quest Game  \n1565, St Elmo\u2019s Pay (Siege of Malta)\nSublime Dark\nAnd there is plenty more in the pipeline too, if you'll have us!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is now the third project for Hall or Nothing Productions.

It sets new standards with a completely unique approach to section reference and replayability.\nSpecial features include: Finding hidden bonus sections, epic boss fights taking place in their own unique chapters, detailed combats, and complex puzzles!\n  PLAY\n\n Sorry, but what's a \"gamebook\"?\nA gamebook is an interactive novel that allows the reader to participate in the story by making effective choices. The narrative branches along various paths through the use of numbered paragraphs, called sections. Find out more.\n  Rider of the Black Sun, developed by author Swen Harder and illustrator FuFu Frauenwahl, was originally released in Germany in 2012 by the publishing house Mantikore.\nSince then, \u201cReiter der schwarzen Sonne\u201d turned out to be one of the publisher\u2019s best-selling game books and received the prestigious RPC Fantasy Award and the German Roleplaying Award.\nRider of the Black Sun as hardcover.\nRight now, it\u2019s available in its 6th edition and was licensed for another two European languages. In 2016 Mantikore printed a small run of promotional copies in English to check the international demand for Rider of the Black Sun.\nThe gamebook was sold within days, so we decided to start a crowdfunding campaign to give gamebook enthusiasts all over the world the opportunity to be part of this special project. And of course we hope, with your support, to make this great gamebook even greater!\n \nSample page of the prologue, including one of FuFu's illustrations.\n  Within all the years on the market, getting feedback from hundreds readers and reviewers, we can say, that Rider of the Black Sun is a bug free gaming experience, meaning no dead-ends or misleading errors.\n Next Level Gamebook Experience\nAnyone who remembers such books from the childhood will be delighted to see these new features in this next generation gamebook:\n\u2022 Over 1,300 sections on 700+ pages divided into 12 chapters, including special combat and bonus chapters\n\u2022 Rules are explained step by step in an easy tutorial in each intermission of the first 4 chapters\n\u2022 Expert rules can easily be added to enhance the difficulty\n\u2022 Many challenging riddles and puzzles to solve\n\u2022 Enhanced three-page character sheet for skills, equipment, values and notes\n\u2022 Ride and command a dragon!\n Kickstarter Bonus Content\nThis Kickstarter campaign may be your only chance to get your hands on this special gamebook.

Once you have done so, you can choose to overpledge by an amount equal to whichever add-ons you want (see FAQ for an example and more details).\nWhen the campaign has ended, we get a backer survey in which you can specify the add-ons you wanted.\nNote: Since many people had problems entering decimal digit numbers, we decided to round the add-on prices now.

But, as you can see on the sample page above, all elements are printed on the left pages, so you can simulate a roll by open the book randomly.\n \nSince our funding goal of \u20ac\u200a6,000 was reached, we enabled a list of stretchgoals to give the community the chance to enhance the reading experience for each new goal achieved.\nAll stretchgoal awards will always add new features to the look and feel of the book itself. For example, since the \u20ac\u200a9,000 goal was accomplished, all books were upgraded to hardcover.\nJust take a look at the list below which additional features all books have now!\n   \n  Since this is a worldwide campaign, we will ship your award anywhere you live on this planet!

For this reason we decided to make this project our first, because nearly everything crucial is done already: translation, layout, illustrations, and testplay! So to say, Rider of the Black Sun is nearly completed.\n\nSure, certain stretchgoals may enhance the workload to finish this project, like adding new drawings, but our illustrator FuFu Frauenwahl is an experienced artist who knows to handle deadlines.\n\nWe judge shipping is the biggest challenge, but we didn\u2019t expect more than a few hundred books to dispatch \u2013 a number which even a small publisher like Mantikore could handle easily.\nEven if we are reasonably confident in our projections, we cannot guarantee to ship until Christmas 2017.\n\nRemember, you will not be charged until the campaign's end, and even then, only if the project has reached its funding goal of \u20ac\u200a6,000.\n\nAt the end, the biggest risk is that we cannot reach enough people for our Rider of the Black Sun Kickstarter.

The modular battlefield represents the dried out ground of the former Pacific Ocean: Up to 40 hexagonal area tiles circle the moon panels, providing score points, blockades and contaminations. The goal is to gather as many score points as possible, through conquering and occupying areas \u2013 thus becoming the most dominant species on the board. Tsukuyumi - Full Moon Down's particular appeal lies in the clash of diverse, asymmetrical factions. At the beginning, each player picks a faction. Each faction comes with their own respective abilities, units and strategies. The game therefore changes depending on which factions meet on the battlefield.\nADD-ONS\nTsukuyumi \u2013 Full Moon Down is a strategy game which avoids elements of luck and coincidences and therefore challenges the tactical abilities of the 3 to 5 (6) players. While the core game mechanisms are quite simple, the different factions - all with their own respective abilities, units and strategies - effect the game and its dynamics profoundly, like small expansion sets would. Thus, the players' decision for one of the asymmetric factions affects what kind of game a group will play.\nStill, the interactions between the fellow players are as crucial as the choice of faction: What powers do I have to protect myself against? Am I fighting a faction of mobile units or of strong giants? In what direction should I expand? The players have an immediate influence on the game: Strategies, goals, missions and victory conditions all depend on the asymmetrical factions that are fighting each other for world domination.\n Video von Boardgame Digger (deutsch)\n1.

Each faction has unique abilities, mechanisms and strenghts that matched their epic background stories.\n\u2022 We need you! King Racoon Games is a small publishing company that was founded not too long ago. Even though we have the support of many great friends, we are still really only two guys who created this game. In order to realize such a big project, we need your help. We need you to spread the word, play the game, send feedback and - even though we hate to ask - we also need your financial support, to be able to produce at a fair price.\n\u2022 You will get a great game! In the three years it took to create Tsukuyumi - Full Moon Down, the game has been tested more than 300 times and at this point we can confidently say that we are very satisfied with the way it turned out and that it is - in fact - a great game.\n\u2022 Kickstarter Exclusive Material! Because we need your support here on Kickstarter, we came up with a ton exclusive content as a way of saying Thank you to our backers.\n\u2022 Stretch Goals! The more people support us on Kickstarter, the more stretch goals will be reached. And the more stretch goals we reach, the more cool material can be included in the final game. Everybody wins!\n\u2022 You can help shape the game! We listen to your feedback, we take your criticism seriously. We appreciate your help in making this game into its best possible version.\nQuality of material (please note: What you see is not the final quality and material. This is a self-printed prototype. Its only function is to give you an idea of what the final thickness and materials will look like.)\nThere is no secret mongering! According to our current offers, this is what we need the money for:\n20.000+ \u20ac printing (area tiles, standees, cards,...), material (wooden cubes, plastic bases,...) \u2192 increasing with the campaign's progress\n3.000+ \u20ac tool costs \u2192 increasing with new content\n2.400 \u20ac \u2192 homepage, video production\n3.600+ \u20ac Kickstarter fee \u2192 10% (increasing proportionally with the campaign's progress)\n7.200+ \u20ac tax fees on surplus value \u2192 increasing proportionally with the campaign's progress\nMore than 300 test games made the balancing of such asymmetric factions possible. At the moment, we are blind testing the game again and put the finishing touches on the rulebook. The illustrations are done and we are completing a few last graphic elements. But all in all, Tsukuyumi is ready for take-off!\nDepending on the amount of games produced, the production and fulfillment period may differ. The game will be produced 100% in Europe to guarantee quality and logistics.\nPlease note: Although most illustrations and designs are already finalized, some things will still look different in the actual game. We have been working with self-printed, cardboard-crafted prototypes (as you can see in the photos) but we promise: The final game will look much better!\nRetailers can also support this project and offer the retail exclusive promo materials.

Set aboard the planet colonising ship the N.W.E. Hikari, players take on the roles of the surviving crew in an epic struggle for their very lives. \nScientists aboard the ship genetically engineered new life forms to explore the planets below but a catastrophic event known as the Fall, saw the creatures escape from containment. Now they rampage through the ship, killing anyone they come across. Players assume the roles of the remaining crew, salvaging whatever you can to survive.\nThe survivors of the Gender Variant Add on\nThe new survivor class and the enemies of the Cybernetic Onslaught add on\nThe Sip Sentry, painted by Agis Neugebauer\nThe Redeemers of Purpose add on\nThe Primus boss, painted by Agis Neugebauer\nIf you're interested in purchasing any of these optional buys, please click the \"Manage Your Pledge\" button on this page and simply increase your pledge amount to cover the items you'd like to get. We'll sort out what your extra money is going towards via our Pledge Manager, which will be sent to you after the campaign ends.\nAlmost 2 years ago to the month we launched our very first Kickstarter, Endure the Stars, which was a huge success for our first foray into the board game and crowdfunding world, and when we finally delivered the game in March of this year we were delighted with the results. But in the 2 years since then we have learned an awful lot, and looking back at our first attempt we felt there were a number of areas we could improve upon.\nWe had always planned to run a second printing Kickstarter for Endure the Stars in Q4 2017, so we found ourselves faced with a choice; launch a second printing of the game without a single change or put our knowledge and experience that we\u2019d accumulated over the past couple of years into this second printing and make an even better game. There were pros and cons to each side of the coin and both faced criticism; the former left us open to condemnation that we hadn\u2019t learned anything from all of the constructive feedback we\u2019d received and the latter had the potential to leave original backers feeling that they had backed and received a lesser version of the game. In the end we did what we felt was best and did everything in our power to make Endure the Stars the best possible game it can be.\nETS 1.5 doesn\u2019t make the original game obsolete as it\u2019s still hugely enjoyable without any of the updated material, but if original backers felt that they had enjoyed the first game enough to invest in an upgrade kit that would breathe fresh life into a game they already have had fun with then that would be the best that we could hope for.\nSo is this a disquieting trend, something you should be worried about with all of our future projects? Of course not, Endure the Stars was our very first and usually the first time you attempt anything a fair amount for na\u00efve mistakes are made, and we were no different. We\u2019re putting all of that valuable experience to great use in Village Attacks, we just felt that we also wanted to go back and apply that same experience to our first game, so we can be confident we made the best version of it that we could, for backers new and old, before moving on with other projects and ensure that Endure the Stars has a great legacy to build upon.\n Players choose from 6 survivors to play as, each with their own unique strengths, weaknesses and abilities that can mean the difference between success and failure. \nThe Marine, painted by Rogland Studio\nThe exo loader, a powerful tool in the survivor's arsenal...if you can find it\nThe G.E.P.E.C'S (Genetically Engineered Planetary Explorer Candidates) or GEPs for short, were created in secret to aid in the exploration and eventual colonisation of the planet being orbited by the Hikari. But a catastrophic event known as The Fall saw the escape of the GEPs, where they rampaged through the ship killing everyone they came across. Now they stalk the derelict halls of this once thriving ship, hunting down any survivors.\nSwarmers, weak but fast and numerous!\nJaegers, resilient beasts that are tough to kill!\nIcarus, ranged attackers whose attacks eat through armour!\nThe Titan Boss, incredibly powerful and controlled by it's own AI deck\n All of the GEPs are production miniatures, wonderfully painted by Bushido Studio.\n The 12 double sided game tiles make up the winding corridors and derelict halls of the ship. The tiles are modular and allow for a myriad of setups.\n The ship is in a constant state of decay, and Event cards compound your problems further with blackouts, lock-downs and artificial gravity failures.\nThe GEPs pose a grave threat to your survival, but so do your fellow crew. Each survivor's resolve is tested many times throughout play, and each survivor can develop a detrimental mix of phobias and habits as a mission progresses. Fears of the dark, no longer desiring to trade with your fellow survivors and screaming out in fear are just a few of the potential Resolve cards a survivor could be dealt. \nA haven hidden away in a quiet corner of the ship, the unique Refuge mechanic in Endure the Stars acts as a waypoint between missions where survivors can visit their loved ones to restore their sanity, rest to recover from their wounds and trade for items that will aid them in the tasks ahead.  Survivors can prolong their stay in the Refuge, but each turn spent there can cause both positive and negative events to trigger. The Refuge can be used to chain together any missions, allowing players to create custom campaigns of whatever length you and your friend wish.\nYou can view the rulebook here:\nClick below to watch a play through by Dice Tower contributor Rob Oren!

The fundamentals of the game have not changed, but we have carefully analysed every element of the game and optimised wherever we felt the was room to. These are the changes that have been made:\nAll 12 game tiles have been re-drawn by Henning Ludvigsen\nAll cards are now smaller, reducing the amount of space the game takes up on the table\nSurvivor and Boss dashboards have been redesigned and now have dials to track their Health and Resolve instead of tokens\nWeapons have been removed from the Item deck and now have their own deck, the Weapon deck (see rulebook)\nAn ammunition mechanic has been added (see rulebook)\nA Weapon Jam and Solomon die has been added to the game (see rulebook)\nDoor standees have been added to the game\n20% of GEP miniatures have been removed from the core game\nVac trays have been added to the core game for storing miniatures much more safely\nThe core game box has been enlarged\nThe rulebook has been revised to reflect Endure the Stars 1.5\nThe First Player token has been enlarged\nThe female Technician from the Cybernetic Onslaught add on\nThe Fanatic from the Redeemers of Purpose add on\nThe female Marine from the Gender Variant add on\nShipping will be charged after the campaign is finished.

Still it is fair enough for what's in the box to keep the product attractive and affordable for the fans who desperately wanted it.\n- Shippings of the pallets will be done by AIR from the factory in China to each logistics hub for individual domestic shipping to quickly follow. This way we can ensure a quick delivery of the copies, however at a higher price than the first campaign for which games were mainly shipped by sea (but regarding the small quantity of copies here and the quick delays, only air shipping is doable).\nIn short, you are backing a project that is already produced and only needs to be assembled and ship to you.

The more funds we collect, the more contents we will unlock through the stretch goals.\nLet's make this game incredibly huge.\nYour opinion matters to us.

The chosen Combat Card MUST include at least one Attack Position indicated on their previously played combat cards follow up bar. \nIf a player has no legal play they may play any combat card and received 1 Damage. At the start of a new Round of Combat players may play any combat card.  \nPlayers then reveal the chosen cards and align them with the top of the cards touching. \nThen refer to the attack positions on the aligned cards to resolve the clash as follows: o Block: If at least one attack position is aligned with an attack position on the opposing card:  No damage is taken.  \nStrike: If no attack positions are aligned with attack positions on the opposing card: The Defending Player takes 1 Damage per attack position on the offensive player\u2019s card. \nPerfect Block: If all attack positions on both cards are aligned with each other: The Offensive Player takes 1 Damage.  \nIf players only have one card in their hand at the end of a Clash, End the Round of Combat by performing the following: The Defending Player becomes the Offensive Player by taking the Offensive Marker. \nTake all played cards and place them all face up in the combat discard pile.  \nStarting with the Offensive Player, players take either a face up combat card into hand and replacing it with a new card from the top of the deck OR taking a random card off the top of the Combat Deck. \nIf the Combat Deck is empty, shuffle the Combat Discard pile and form a new Combat Deck.  \nOnce both players have 5 cards in hand, begin a new Round of Combat.  \nCard abilities are no longer in effect thus nothing from the previous round carries over to the new round. This includes follow up bar requirements and abilities that trigger on the next card played.  \nIf a Character has received total damage equal to or greater than their character cards abilities, they have permanently unlocked that new ability and apply its effects on future clashes when appropriate.  \nOnce all above steps have been resolved proceed to the next clash. End Game  \nOnce a player has received 12 or more Damage, the game is over and the surviving player wins. o If both players received 12 or more Damage during the same clash, the player who received the least total damage wins.  \nIf it is still a tie, the Defending Player wins.   \nCLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE RULE SHEET\nRule Sheet\n  Playmat\n    The Undead Viking Review is here!\n Twist Gaming\n Bowers Game\n     ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nB&B Games has now had several successfully funded projects.\n\nWe believe in quality above all else and have chosen to use a well-established production organization with a deep experience in game production.

In this dark, medieval universe, kings plot for the throne of France, and on the battlefield their heroic knights clash with foes both real and legendary.\nFor more than a century, from 1337 to 1453, the fields of France rang to the sound of constant warfare. The Hundred Years\u2019 War is one of the longest wars ever fought and is the source of many of our collective ideas about heroic knights of old. It was also a time of myths and legends, and a fervent faith in the literal truth of the doctrine of Holy Mother Church. It is this world of strife and faith that this game recreates.\nIn Time of Legends: Joan of Arc, all the creatures that the medieval people thought were real, are real. Whether they are represented on tapestries, in stained glass windows, or in illuminated manuscripts, we take them at their word. It is this dark and epic universe that you will explore in the game\u2019s many scenarios. Some are historical, with no taint of the whispered legends of strange creatures. Others are replete with the supernatural or (saints preserve us) demonic.\nYou are free to control the army of miniatures that represent your heroes, knights and peasants as you wish in order to achieve your goals. You will decide who moves and where; whether your forces explore, pray, converse with locals, or simply charge into battle. But before we get to the field of glory, you must first choose your side.\nDownload the Beta Rulebook here !  \n  All of these unlocked stretch goals are added FREE to every Maiden pledge, and every copy of the core box you pledge for.\n                                Joan Of Arc, Bertrand Du Guesclin, La Hire, Gilles de Rais & Jean de Dunois (miniatures are supplied assembled and unpainted)\n The French have a very large army whose leaders follow the code of chivalry to the letter. These noble knights form the main striking force of the army, with their infantry taking a subservient role. The French employ few archers, but do hire efficient crossbowmen to fight alongside their men-at-arms. All these warriors fight on behalf of the King of France, who sees the war as a chance to reclaim lands lost to the English under earlier monarchs.\nThe Black Prince, Falstaff, John Talbot, John Chandos & John of Lancaster (miniatures are supplied assembled and unpainted)\nThe English king considers himself the legitimate heir to the throne of France, and there is some truth in this. In fact, he only failed to gain the crown because the French changed the rule of royal succession to stop him.\nThe English army, though considerably less numerous than the French, are formidable combatants, who often have the best strategists. Their longbowmen wreak havoc on the battlefield, and have repeatedly bested the cream of French chivalry in battle. This is a slight that the French knights are determined to avenge.\nArchangel Gabriel, the Unicorn & Angel (miniatures are supplied assembled and unpainted)\nThe army of God is made up of powerful, heavenly beings like the angels and archangels. They fight their righteous battles alongside the lesser creatures of God, and the weary mortals who struggle with sin, but are devoted to their creator.\nThe Holy Army can be played independently, or allied with the French, or the English.\nThe Witch, the Werewolf & the Ghost Warrior (miniatures are supplied assembled and unpainted)\nThe Devil\u2019s army is made up of all sorts of foul creatures: werewolves, demons, skeletons, dragons, witches, and many more. Countless fallen mortals march alongside this monstrous host, having cast aside their God and sold their souls for mere wealth or power. It is rumoured that in this dark time, when the End of Days has never seemed so close, even the Devil himself may make an appearance...\nThe Unholy Army can be played independently, or allied with the French, or the English.\n All of these unlocked stretch goals are added FREE to every Maiden pledge, and every copy of the core box you pledge for.\nTime of Legends: Joan of Arc can be played in two different modes: scenario or battle.\nIn the scenario mode, you choose a scenario from the many options offered in the core box and elsewhere. The key feature of a scenario is that it sets a scene and describes a situation, then lets you finish the story by playing a game. A scenario can be anything from a select group of heroes investigating dire rumours of witchcraft, to a sudden ambush featuring dozens of soldiers on either side.\nIn the battle mode, you fight your opponent using an army of your choice. The key feature of battle mode is that both players choose their own forces \u2013 nothing is pre-set.

An amazing Euro minis game. The way you activate the models is extremely innovative. It was awesome, the most fun of any game I played in the vendor hall.\u201d\nD6 Generation at Gen Con 2017\n\u201cMythic Games is no slouch when it comes to producing excellent gaming experiences and they\u2019re ready to take everyone back in time with their latest game, Time of Legends: Joan of Arc. Words really cannot do the pieces justice.\u201d\nFresh Mana\n\u201csi le c\u0153ur est \u00e0 l\u2019affrontement, le c\u00f4t\u00e9 narratif suinte de toutes parts, envahit le gameplay pour proposer une exp\u00e9rience vibrante et forte, et donner des options significativement vari\u00e9es au joueur.\u201d\n\u201cIf the heart of the game is in confrontation, the narrative oozes in from all sides, and infuses the gameplay to provide a strong, vibrant experience that provides the players with significantly different options.\u201d\n VIDEOS IN ENGLISH\n             VIDEOS EN FRANCAIS\n            Joan of Arc uses a different scale from what is usually offered on Kickstarter, the Legendary Scale. This smaller but extremely accurate and detailed scale offers many advantages:\n- You can play on a normal sized table, and yet have a large area to cover and a wide variety of terrain types;\n- You can play, if desired, with a very large number of figures on each side; We can include complete and numerous 3D buildings: church, houses, trees, rocks, etc.\n- You can enjoy a dramatically impressive size difference between humans and creatures. Thus, our giants and monsters are really enormous... And our dragon has the actual size that this legendary monster should have.\nSize comparison : Odysseus (from Mythic Battles:Pantheon), Gilles de Rais, Crossbowmen & Angel.\nThe Time of Legends: Joan of Arc miniatures fall into three categories:\nHeroes\nJoan of Arc\nThese are figures known from the medieval period. They possess powers and can level up during an adventure or a battle.\nTroops \nHalberdiers\nThese are the basic units of armies. They are set in groups of 3 infantry models, 2 cavalry models, or 1 single model for exceptionally powerful beings such as angels, demons or dragons. They do not level up, but may possess powers.\nCharacters \nBishop\nThey represent professional bodies of medieval society: blacksmith, priest, merchant, diviner, shepherd, etc. They are always set in 1 single model and bring special powers to their allies, but can rarely fight and can not level up. They are neutral at first, and rally those who enter their zone. Some of them are called Protagonists and have a Discussion Deck. Only a Hero or a Character can discuss with a Protagonist.\nGog and Magog \n     Gog and Magog are two giants offered exclusively to all backers who have taken at least one Maiden Pledge (the Companion in Arms does not qualify), only during the time of this 31 days campaign. These \"Super Exclusive\" figures will only be available during the Kickstarter campaign, to thank the backers who supported us from the start. They will not be available during the Late Pledge, or during the Pledge Manager if you only pledged for less than a Maiden Pledge during the Kickstarter campaign, they will not be given or sold at convention or event.\nThese two terrifying heralds of the Apocalypse, foretellers of chaos and the end of time, possess devastating power on the battlefield.\nGog is poured into satanic magic, while the powerful Magog is a real killing machine. You will be able to play Gog and Magog in one of the proposed scenarios as well as in Battle mode, they are part of the Unholy Army.\nTo know more about God and Magog, read this update\n3D Scenery\nThe game offers a large number of buildings and elements of 3D terrain. They are not just eye candy, in fact they all have a real gameplay. Thus, they count in the occupation of the play areas, offering various bonuses/penalties and opening new scenaristic options. For example, praying in a church gives more Myth points than praying elsewhere and the presence of trees in a forest area allows the defender to roll a defence dice against ranged attacks. Buildings can be visited, searched, and offer defensive bonuses. The buildings are laid on cardboard floor plans. When miniatures penetrate inside a building, the building is temporarily removed to place the minis on the floor plans. When all the minis leave, the building is put back on the board to indicate that it is unoccupied.\nTerrain Tiles\nJoan of Arc is played on modular tiles, composed of large Hexagons divided into 1, 2 or 3 areas. Each area is a type of terrain (Forest, Plain, Field, Marsh, Village, etc.) that can accommodate elements of terrain and of course, miniatures!\nAn area taking up the whole hexagon can contain 8 elements (bases of miniatures or terrain elements).\nThis area is saturated, it contains 8 elements\nAn area taking a half hexagon can contain 6 elements.\nAn area taking one third of a hexagon can contain 4 elements\nThis area is saturated, the Tarasque counts as 4 elements.\nBattle Dashboard\nThe Battle Dashboard combines all the elements of the current game that are common to all players: available resources for the turn, Doom dice, river cards. You also lay down the miniatures that were put out of combat after a fight. These figures will return to the battlefield if the Doom dice is favorable to them... or leave it definitively to join the cemetery if fate falls on them!\nPlayer Dashboards\n Each player has their own dashboard that allows them to manage their resources: activation cubes, experience tokens and myth tokens. In his turn, the player spends them to activate his units (cubes), to pay the cost of a Myth or Tactic card he wants to play (tokens Myth/Tactic) or the leveling cost of the hero he wants to level up (Experience tokens). At the end of his turn, the player may decide to keep his resources in the spaces provided for this purpose.\nSpecial Dice\nDuring combat, the players roll dice of different colours, in attack and defence.\nWhite engravings mean that these dice can kill\nBlack engravings mean that these dice are disruptive\nRed dice are the most offensive dice.\nBlack dice are the most defensive dice.\nYellow dice are the dice of the special effects.\nWhite dice are the most balanced dice.\nCards\nEach unit of miniatures has its own card, placed on the table in front of the player so that he can consult at a glance its characteristics. Heroes can level up during the game by spending experience points.\nRules\nWe will be uploading a pdf of the rulebook soon.\n The European Union, USA, Canada and Australia zones will be \u201cShipping Friendly\u201d: Backers from these countries will not suffer  import taxes.\nBased on our Mythic Battles: Pantheon experience, we will be charging shipping once the Kickstarter is over, based on the actual costs. We will collect the information via our pledge manager after the campaign ends. We will ship your rewards at our cost to our international hubs. Depending on where in the world you are, we will either ship to you from our hub in France (EU backers), China (Asia Pacific backers), USA (The USA and the rest of the world), Australia (Australia and New Zealand backers). The following is a list of rough estimates for shipping a standard game Joan of Arc package that is roughly the same weight as Mythic Battles: Pantheon (5.25kg weight for core box + SG). Keep in mind these are just estimates, and costs may rise based on weight increases from unlocked stretch goals and any optional buys you choose.\nUSA: $25-$30 to most states. \nCANADA: $30-$35 to most cities.\nLATIN AMERICA: $100 to most countries. \nASIA: $40 to China and Hong Kong. $50 to most other countries. \nOCEANIA: $30 to Australia. $65 to New Zealand.\nEUROPE: $25-$30 to France. $25-$35 to most other countries. \nREST OF THE WORLD: $105.\nWe will do our utmost to ensure that your products arrive on time, before the public release of the game. However, we are aware that some problems concerning shipping and production may arise that are outside of our sphere of influence. The immense majority of backers will receive their game before the general release, but there are specific locations that might take much longer to get delivered, so we cannot guarantee that a 100% of our backers will receive their copy of the game before the general release, there might be a few of them who won\u2019t. We can, at least, guarantee that you will be benefitting from a great discount and many exclusive Kickstarter only features. The commercial version of the game will include a lot less material than the KS one. If these special contents and prices are not sufficient when compared to the risk of not being delivered on time, then we suggest that you do not participate in this crowdfunding campaign and acquire the game when it is released in shops.\nWHO WORKED ON THE PROJECT?\nFrom left to right: Irek Zielinski, Olivier Thill, Beno\u00eet Vogt, Jake Thornton, Leonidas Vesperini, David Rakoto, Christophe Madura, St\u00e9phane Gantiez, Erwann Le Torrivellec\n  Pascal Bernard, author of the game, in front of the \"Joan of Arc house\" in Orl\u00e9ans, the house in which Joan spent the night during the Siege of Orl\u00e9ans.\nOn top of the people from Mythic Games, a huge team of passionate professionals has worked on Joan of Arc.

For that purpose, they have been granted power over the Emotions, Cerebria's denizens: they can invoke, move, empower and evolve Emotions to influence and control Cerebria's Realms and Frontiers.\nCerebria's state is in constant flux until a Spirit triggers a Revelation - these are key moments in the game when the current game state is evaluated and is preserved as a permanent Bliss or Gloom fragment on the Identity.\nCerebria is a deep and highly customizable game full of player interaction, where timing and cooperation with your teammate are essential to victory.\n      Multiple aspects of area control: Cerebria features seven different aspects of area control. The game is objective-driven: while each of these control aspects give benefits, their importance in scoring will change dynamically based on the Aspiration (objective) cards. Each side will have their own secret Aspiration, but there is also a common one, contested by both sides. By gaining resources from the Origin, players will eventually trigger Revelations - this is when the Aspiration cards are evaluated, and a Bliss or Gloom Fragment is added to the Identity based on the result.\nLeave your Mark on Cerebria's Identity: Cerebria has an innovative scoring system, manifesting in an impressive physical form in the middle of the board: the Identity. It is built of Fragments scored by Bliss and Gloom during Revelations, and apart from keeping track of the struggle between the two sides, both its size and facing have ongoing effects on the gameplay.\nThe Emotion cards: Cerebria's gameplay revolves around the Emotions, the Inside World's inhabitants. These quirky little guys all have their unique, thematic special abilities, and an Intensity value that depends on the amount of Essence in them. The more intense they are, the more effectively they can influence Cerebria's Realms and Frontiers - with enough Essence, they can even be evolved to their stronger form! \nThere are dozens of different Emotions available, with even more to come - enough to build and customize your own Emotion deck before each game to suit your play style.\nTeam game with thematic play modes for various player numbers\nCerebria has a strong team play aspect: in a four player game, each side controls two Spirits, working together to spread Bliss or Gloom across the Inside World. However, we are also adding a game mode where a player can play with an empowered version of a Spirit: the Shaper. \nThe Shaper has additional abilities and more actions to match up against two Spirits at once, making it an ideal alternative for 3-player games, and for 2-player games with two Shapers. We have even more game modes for various player numbers as stretch goals that we can't wait to reveal!\n                Adding Cerebria - The Card Game to your pledge will not incur any additional shipping costs. For more details on Cerebria - the Card Game, check outUpdate #8!\n    Actual factory samples of pre-painted miniatures.\n                    This is a quick overview of how Cerebria plays. For more details on the rules and gameplay, we recommend checking out Cerebria\u2019s work-in-progress rulebook.\n  Take Actions with your Spirit: On your turn, you can take up to three Actions with your Spirit. Each of these actions cost one action point and some amount of Willpower. The pool of action points is shared between allied players, and is refilled for each of the game\u2019s five rounds. There are 9 different actions players can take - some of these can be made more efficient by controlling their respective Realm, while others are specific to your Spirit and can be upgraded by discarding Emotion cards.\nInteract with Emotions to control Realms and Frontiers: Spirits can interact with Emotion cards in many ways: they can invoke, intensify, move and empower friendly Emotions, and quell hostile ones. Each Emotion has an Intensity value depending on the amount of Essence on it - if your side\u2019s combined Intensity on a Realm or a Frontier is higher, you gain control of it. Realm control makes your Actions more efficient, Frontier control increases your Willpower income, and both can contribute to scoring during a Revelation. \nScore Identity Fragments with well-timed Revelations: Once per round, Spirits can use their Meditation action to take Willpower from the Origin\u2019s adjacent spheres. When one of these spheres are emptied, a Revelation occurs - the climactic moment when players evaluate their secret Aspiration cards, as well as the common one. Whichever side completed more Aspiration cards can add their Fragment to Cerebria\u2019s identity - this is a big step towards victory as the Identity\u2019s composition will be crucial in determining the winner at the end of the game.\n                       \"Cerebria is a beautiful, complex game about the inner workings of a mind, as Gloom and Bliss vie for dominance. I love the way that the card abilities reflect the various competing emotions and mental states.\"   \n -Jonathan H. Liu - Geek Dad\n\"Cerebria is a rich, esoteric world of emotion-filled conflict and collaboration that, while occasionally confounding, brings a distinctly unique mindset to team-based area control games. Rather than relying on brute strength or indiscriminate decisions, this game both values and requires well-timed, precision-based tactics to sway the outcome of the burgeoning consciousness you're fighting over. With Cerebria Mindclash continues its tradition of games with excellent components, clever themes, and complex-yet-intriguing systems to explore. And this may be their most ambitious title yet.\"   \n- Ryan LaFlamme, The Cardboard Republic\n               For the shipping and fulfillment of Cerebria, we will be using region-friendly solutions for the EU, US, Canada and Australia. In these regions, you don't have to worry about customs and duty. \nMost of our shipping partners, such as Funagain in the US or Snakes and Lattes in Canada, are proven ones we've been successfully cooperating with in the past.\nFor the first time, we will be using a pledge manager after the Kickstarter. This will allow us to charge a realistic and accurate shipping cost after the campaign is over. The game\u2019s eventual weight may vary based on the unlocked stretch goal content, but the below table should provide a good estimation of the shipping costs that can be expected. We would like to make sure you get an excellent deal by backing Cerebria, so we are contributing a $7 subsidy to the shipping to make sure the cost remains affordable. \n         ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is Mindclash Games\u2019 third Kickstarter campaign, and both of our previous games, Trickerion and Anachrony, have been manufactured and delivered worldwide within (or very close to) the originally promised time frame, to nearly 9000 backers in total. By now, our team has a solid grasp on the process of designing, developing, manufacturing and delivering a complex, high quality tabletop game. When it comes to a project like this, there are always certain risks regarding production and delivery that are beyond our control and may cause delays. That said, the July 2018 delivery deadline is a safe estimation that we are confident we can keep.\n\nThis project does pose a new challenge to us: the painted miniatures. We are aware that factory painting can be a warning sign to some, but since we feel the painted Spirits would be a perfect fit to Cerebria's visual style, we'we been working to make this happen right from the beginning. We\u2019ve already spent a lot of time iterating on the painting quality and style with our manufacturer, and couldn\u2019t be happier with the result! Our manufacturing partner will be Panda Games Manufacturing once again, and with years of successful cooperation behind us, we are 100% confident that they are a good choice for this project.\n\nThe game development is about 80% finished, while the artwork is at about 90%.

You'll need to divine the other's desires in order to build trust, play your cards right, and transform mutual trust into starry satisfaction. How tingly will your interplanetary liaison feel in the end? Will your encounter leave one party sweaty and exhausted, the other hungering for more? It's up to the two of you to find out... together!\nUPDATE: Check out the replay of our latest livestream of Consentacle play, featuring Frank Lantz and Eric Zimmerman. Can two \"senior statesmen\" of game design find intimacy by tangling through cards? What do they even think of this game... at the formal or narrative level?\nWe've blown past our first two stretch goals, described below... and much faster than anticipated! So we've been making plans and measuring feasibility for further goals that won't compromise the quality of gameplay just for an overstuffed box. (OK, we know some of you like overstuffed boxes and excess libidinal energy, but we tried to pack a lot into Consentacle in the first place!) Here's the deal:\nIf we reach $135,000 in pledges (it can be done!) then every backer will get a free download of a 12-page Consentacle comic book.  On top of that, every box of Consentacle will come with the first two pages as a preview in the back of the manual--that way, you'll get some nicely printed comic art as well. This comic will tell a brief story of how Kit and Dup met, and what stood in the way. Most of all, it'll be full of more great artwork by James Harvey! Here's a collage of multiple comic-book pages by James from Batgirl and We Are Robin (for DC Comics... yep, that Robin -- but also very different Robins than the shopworn ones):\n  If you'd like to see more of James's range, check out stopjamesharvey.com or heck, check out them search results! I'm likely to help some with plotting and dialogue, but I'm keen on visual storytelling first without over-prescribing. (If you're really curious, you can check out my speech-bubbly writing work in games like Egg vs Chicken and Miss Management.\nConsentacle was originally produced as a showcase prototype for the No Quarter exhibition of games, with only a few sets in existence. We're bringing it to Kickstarter to fund mass production because so many people have asked if they can have a copy. To get it out to as many people as possible, Consentacle is priced to fund a single run, not additional printings! But what about a publisher? Well, given how unusual and suggestive Consentacle is, we've heard from more than one experienced source that it's unlikely to be widely published without some significant changes that we wouldn't want to make. There's always a possibility, but this may be the only time you can purchase a copy of Consentacle, ever. We're not guaranteeing that any stock will be left over!\nIMPORTANT: if you've played Consentacle at an event, or stared closely at photos and videos, that's the prototype version! We're making some changes in order to be able to mass-produce the game, and because we've found some problems with our pretty \"made for a gallery opening, but not for long use\" prototype materials.\nFirst of all, the cards will be smaller, but easier to shuffle, deal, and hold. If we raise a little more than our base funding level, we'll be able to upgrade the quality to an even nicer ivorycore cardstock! UPDATE: Done! Ivorycore is in.\nThe tokens in the box will either be chipboard (the kind you punch out from a sheet) or\u2014if this campaign gathers enough backers for it to be feasible\u2014injection-molded acrylic (more similar to the tokens you see in photos and videos of Consentacle, although slightly different as those are laser-cut). UPDATE: Done! We're definitely going with acrylic tokens!\nWe know many of you who've played or seen Consentacle are big fans of the colorful acrylic tokens, so we're hoping we can make them available for everyone! To make the game accessible to the maximum number of potential players, we didn't want to jack up the price to include acrylic tokens unless there's enough interest to make it less expensive for everyone! (Plastic pieces get a lot more affordable once you're making thousands of copies.)\nFor manufacturing and shipping, we're working with a number of experienced partners including Panda Game Manufacturing, who've helped produce and create many Kickstarted board and card games. Check out their showcase of successfully shipped games! We're also pleased to be able to offer \"shipping included\" prices worldwide.\nOK, settle down! We have even more ways that you can enthusiastically stuff more Consentacle into your life!\nLove the artwork on Consentacle's cards? If you back at the $58 level, you'll receive a print of the artwork from Consentacle's box cover (without labels) in full color on A3 photo-quality paper. Right now that's the piece below (Lick), but if we exceed our base funding goal we'll  commission a new original piece of artwork. Prints are limited to 100 backers!\n\"Lick.\"\nWe're also offering very limited amounts for two higher reward levels where you can commission artwork by James Harvey. Want to envision yourself in the world of Consentacle, whether as a tentacled alien or a curious human? Backers at the $235 level can specify how they want to be portrayed in a limited-color portrait, while one backer at the $750 level can request details for a full-color commission of a scene that can potentially have multiple characters! Check out James Harvey's website for more examples of what he can do. Backers at these two levels will also get a copy of James' latest book, Mouth Baby, from Black Hook press, and the $750 backer will receive a copy of James' out-of-print comic Masterplasty, Image comics edition.\n  Consentacle comes with what Naomi's decided are the most essential cards for a balanced mix. If we reach the quality-improving stretch goals described above, we may consider adding some optional extra cards! Stay tuned for more.\nYou're in luck! We have some of those left from Consentacle's debut exhibition, where players were provided with rubber tentacles to wear on their fingers. If you back at the $200 level, you'll not only get a signed copy of Consentacle, but two tentacles from the exhibition set.\nFor an overview, watch the video at the top of this page! You can also download a PDF of the rules or read on for a detailed breakdown.\n1. To begin, you'll need a partner who consents to playing with you, of course! Decide who'll play the Alien and who'll play the Human; you each get a deck, tokens in your color (red for the Human, blue for the Alien) and five cards for your starting hand.\nSome cards are more useful than others at the start of the game! If you don't like your hand, you have one chance to re-draw at the start of the game (a \"mulligan.\")\nEach turn, you and your partner will choose and simultaneously reveal a card. But first, you'll need to decide what difficulty mode you're playing on!\nIn PRACTICE CONSENT mode, you're allowed to talk out loud about your cards and strategize with each other about what to play next.\nIn CONSENT CHALLENGE mode, you can't discuss your cards at all, or make suggestions; you may only communicate non-verbally about the game. (Exception: you can remind your partner to draw a card, move tokens, etc.)\nSOUL WINDOWS mode is similar, but you may only express yourself with your eyes: no sounds or gestures, just a telepathic gaze.\nAGENTS OF CONSENT involves wearing sunglasses and staring impassively at your partner's blank visage.\nPlaying cards in Consentacle lets you perform various actions with your Trust Tokens. Some cards let you earn more Trust Tokens, while others let you move some of your Trust Tokens to a central pool:\nOnce you have some Tokens of each color in the central pool, you can effectively play cards that let you create purple Satisfaction Tokens by swapping out pairs of red and blue Trust Tokens:\n Each matched pair of Trust Tokens (one red, one blue) has the possibility of becoming one Satisfaction Token.\nSatisfaction Tokens determine the outcome of the game: was it good for you? Both of you? Play a Release card to boldly claim Satisfaction for yourself:\nThe secret to a more satisfying intimate encounter lies in playing combos. If the card you play creates a combo with your partner's card, the effect of your card may be boosted, taking you to new heights of mutual trust or satisfaction:\nBut be careful: you can't just try to match your partner's card, you've also got to think about what you're doing. Some combos are just awkward; when you both try to slyly wink at each other, you'll earn a little Trust, but not as much as you would have otherwise:\nThe last turn of the game happens after you draw the final card from your deck (you won't have a chance to play every single card, time being the enemy of every dalliance). So who won? Nobody\u2014sex is only a competition if you want it to be! To find out how the encounter was, the Consentacle rules have a chart to consult for an evaluation of your intimate encounter (click the little image below to check out the chart on the last page of our rules PDF!)\n  The full game adds a number of advanced cards as well, giving you more ways to mix it up, enhance your passionate skills, coordinate complexly with each other, and boost yourself to new heights of satisfaction!\nIt depends on what you mean! Not safe for... weddings? Walmart? Wee little kids? Women's music festivals? Witch covens? Water? Work? The answer is yes, no, that's a parenting decision, probably not, yes, the cards are not waterproof, and depends. Consentacle and all the artwork in it are designed to be suggestive, not explicit; my goal was to create a game that could be played in public without undue embarrassment and furtiveness, but with due blushing and giggling. The most explicit thing in the game is probably the fact that one card is called \"PENETRATE.\" If you're looking for more nudity and overt, sexually arousing material, we hear that \"consentacle\" as a genre has become an increasingly popular search term on some websites and forums that serve up explicit artwork!\nSpecial Thanks and Credit to: Shuangshuang Huo (video shooting/editing), Melanie Bossert (prototype token fabrication), Sarah Elmaleh (video narration), Anna Anthropy, Lauren Naturale, and Zoe Harvey.  \nThanks to many playtesters and video stars including Ben Norskov, Mohini Dutta, Robert Yang, Eddie Cameron, Eric Zimmerman, Nathalie Pozzi, Josh DeBonis, Amanda DeBonis, Colleen Macklin, Renee Zalles, Scott Price, Toni Pizza, Bennett Foddy, Doug Wilson, Jesse Fuchs, merritt k, and many more players.\nExtra Special Thanks: Charles Pratt & the NYU Game Center, without whose support the original game wouldn't have been made.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nConsentacle will be Naomi's second successful Kickstarter, following Sissyfight Returns in 2013: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1805029723/sissyfight-2000-returns\nThe team on that Kickstarter started the work of porting Sissyfight to a new platform and creating new artwork as soon as the Kickstarter finished; the team finished development and delivered all rewards to backers over the course of 2014.\n\nThis time around, Consentacle is a nearly complete project already; our team is seeking Kickstarter support to fund two things only: a completed set of illustrations for cards (80% done at time of writing, 20% to go) and the manufacturing and shipping of the actual games! New rules and cards have been tested over a period of months, and we've identified and started planning with some great, experienced manufacturing and fulfillment partners.\n\nMore details about what Kickstarter funds will be used for: James Harvey will be creating over 20 new illustrations for cards, and Naomi will do layout of a new card design with those illustrations. We'll be designing the box and laying out the rules again, with the new rules for the advanced game and cards in the mix. After that, it's off to manufacturing and finally shipping to our backers: if we reach our funding goal, those last stages will account for almost 90% of the funds we raise!\n\nThings that could go wrong: James or Naomi could get sick or injured (cross your tentacles against that risk!) Delays in manufacturing, ocean freight, customs or shipping to backers could crop up -- they often do, and sometimes it's beyond a Kickstarter creator's control. To reduce that risk, we are working with a very experienced group of game manufacturing experts (Panda Game Manufacturing, pandagm.com) who've helped turn numerous successfully-funded Kickstarter campaigns into real games in backers' hands.\n\nBecause this is our team's first non-digital Kickstarter game project, we're also getting lots of advice from close friends and colleagues who've done it before, like the folks at Local No. 12 (the Metagame, https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2093152267/the-metagame-discuss) and Resonym (Monarch, https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/maryflanagan/monarch-board-game-vie-for-the-crown?ref=profile_created and Visitor in Blackwood Grove, https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/maryflanagan/visitor-in-blackwood-grove?ref=profile_created).\n\nFinally, we've already lined up a set of regional distributors who also have plenty of experience in shipping Kickstarter board and card games to backers, quickly and intact.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "Print & Play version of Consentacle only", "descp": "Access to the downloadable print & play edition of Consentacle, which includes printable versions of cards, tokens, rules, and playmat.

Second we just want to mention that is not that difficult to order the table of your dreams from us at a very affordable price for the value. But, that said, what started out as a simple Kickstarter with one table, has grown a bit in scope. The community (you guys) have asked for some awesome things and we are trying to make sure you have the choices that you asked for. So what that means is you just need to read and take your time to understand all that this Table of Ultimate Gaming product and Kickstarter can offer. If we could emphasize one thing, it is that the way this Kickstarter will work is that you will find the Pledge level that suits you, pay for your Pledge level and then you wait for the the post-campaign survey to arrive in your email box. It is in that survey from our friends at CrowdOx (it is digital and super easy) that you select your table size, table color, table height, accessories and such. So in short, your pledge payment locks in your place in the production line, and the survey you get later tells us what you want from us.You can also add things at that time if you wish like some of our accessories. Inside CrowdOx survey will be the add-on store. It is really cool! Look for that a week or so after the 35 day campaign ends in September. www.crowdox.com if you want to check them out further.\n    FIND US NOW AT www.ultimategametable.com\nRead below information carefully to learn about more options and info on how to place your pledge and order: \n            You can combine our tables together to create larger tables.

We're mad about old school games that are a challenge to play. We're passionate about pixel art. We really love Roguelikes and classic RPGs. And we sincerely believe that every good game should be a piece of art, not just business. As a result, we're creating UnDungeon to reflect all of our principles.\nEvery gamer probably has their own perspective on what the ideal game is, but as developers we're in the special position of being able to bring our ideals to life. So, UnDungeon introduces a mix of Action, Roguelike, and old-school RPG styles and wraps them in a gorgeous pixel skin. And now, we\u2019d like to share it with you!\nUnDungeon will be released for PC/Mac/Linux on Steam and GOG (DRM Free). Additionally, we'd like to launch it on PS4, Xbox, Nintendo Switch and PS Vita - but ports for these consoles will be possible only after achieving corresponding stretch goals!\nSince our childhood, we've always been told that the universe is endless; that there are billions of worlds and that it's impossible to reach any of them. They\u2019ve been telling us we are billions of light years away. But what if they haven\u2019t told us the whole truth?\nWhat if we live in a multiverse of parallel worlds which are separated by nothing but a thin membrane. And what if this membrane is not impenetrable?\nThe moment in history, known as The Shift, not only made the Earth absolutely insecure, but destroyed it as a shelter for mankind. The reasons for the cataclysm are still far beyond human understanding, but its consequences have essentially changed scientific dogma related to the structure of the Universe and the position of the human race within it.  \nA small failure in the Multiversal mechanism combined seven parallel worlds together. Inhabitants of these very different civilizations suddenly became neighbors... against their will.\nThe game world is based on the Multiversal principles. This means that all dimensions which exist in the Multiverse are parallel. Therefore, multiple variations of the same place, such as Earth, are possible.\nThe affected worlds are not aliens to one another. They are just different variations of the same planet; variations where something went wrong in the past, causing unusual scenarios to develop.\nWhat if one variation of our Earth was inhabited by aliens long before the appearance of homosapiens? What if, in another dimension, the evolution went a completely different way? And somewhere else again, common physical laws don't work as you'd expect? \nNo matter how dissimilar they are, The Shift brought them all together into a single melting pot.\nRight after The Shift took place, seven Heralds appeared in different parts of the world. Each one is a keeper of the artifact called The Core.\nThe Core does not let its carrier die, instead causing him or her to be reborn again and again - changing the surrounding world each time the Herald resurrects. This artifact is a clue to the nature of the Shift. Each Herald feels a craving for a certain location of the newly-created world, where the power of the Core can be revealed.\nThe Herald moves across a procedurally-generated map which is divided into regions relating to the different worlds. He or she visits various locations communicating, fighting, and trading with other inhabitants.\nThe Herald desperately explores the environment trying to obey the call of the Core. Mistakes are not allowed because the score is ruled by permadeath. \nAlthough the Core will resurrect the Herald, the old world will be lost forever, and you will have to start the exploration of a completely new planet - the equivalent of a new game beginning.\nAll combat takes place in real time. A character uses artifacts and amplifiers that can be combined, enabling the Herald to adapt to all possible threats.\nTraditionally for top-down games, UnDungeon provides fast-paced combat with dodging, reflectors, frequent change of positions, etc. We rely on realistic physics to create more spectacular projectile trajectories, debris scattering, bouncing, grenade throwing, etc. \nEach action performed in a battle, except movements, consumes a certain amount of energy points (EP).\nThe energy is an alternative to the traditional weapon-recharge mechanic, which makes combat more comprehensive and helps avoid mindless ability-spamming.\nAs a player, you act as one of the seven Heralds, each of whom comes from a particular world destroyed by the Shift. The Heralds are not ordinary creatures; they are absolutely unique in comparison with common action\\RPG heroes. So let's get to know them better.\n            It's necessary to mention one important aspect: all characters in UnDungeon are not going to save innocents or fight for love and peace. Some of them are willing to destroy humanity and other competitors in order to gain new territory for their race.\nThat said, you will certainly play as a positive hero as well, but don\u2019t hope for any privileges as with most RPGs. There's no way to solve quests the 'right' way in UnDungeon, because each solution leads to different consequence... and there is always someone who will disagree with your choice.\nExploring the world, the characters will find various supernatural objects and artifacts. There are two types of objects: passive and active. The passive ones alter various characteristics, add small additional properties, and can be stored and used in an unlimited quantity. As for active objects, they provide new features or essentially change the existing ones. \nSince such objects are placed in special slots, it is possible to mix all the available character's abilities, forming a huge variety of combinations.\nEach Herald has a unique pool of objects which is not available to the other characters. Consequently, each one has an exclusive playstyle and development path. What's more, each artifact provides an impact on characters' appearance.\nAnd since the order and number of objects are totally random, each new trial is characterized by a unique character's look. Plus, each equipped artifact provides the influence on the character's appearance (sometimes these changes are vital). See the examples below:\n  UnDungeon is created in the isometric perspective: hand-drawn pixelart is combined with a large number of animation frames and extremely high detail.\nWe also plan to create a set of pixel cutscene movies that would illustrate some key events of the game. 90% of our art is drawn by hand. Seldom, we use 3D-workpieces as a basis of large objects.\nThe graphics were inspired by such projects as Hyper Light Drifter, EITR, Dungeon of the Endless and a mix of different genres - sci-fi, fantasy, steam and cyberpunk. Since we think that pixelart, like any branch of art, should evolve, we use features that are not common to pixel games: glowing, gradients and various colors blending modes, unlimited palette. Plus, glitch art is used to emphasise the Shift.\nAll game graphics and animations are made manually. We have set a goal to make the visual aspect of Undungeon as bright as possible preserving the vibe of hand made pixel art in a top-down perspective.\nMusic and sound design for UnDungeon are created by our good friend and experimental musician stonefromthesky. Both music and sounds are two very important components that affect the gaming experience. The sound designer's goal is to emphasize the game atmosphere. Therefore, music varies from ambient to sludgy electronic depending on a surrounding world and situation. For instance, The Wasteland Law was written for the exploration of a post-nuclear desert world. We are trying to make more studio and live sounds, because we don't want to use common chiptune soundtracks. Below, you can listen to several songs that will become the game soundtrack.\n    Currently, UnDungeon is situated at its pre-alpha stage of development. The working prototype has been already developed. It includes the combat system, map and local level generation, ability combination system, loot, and other aspects. The next one is a quest system.\nAt the same time we work on sound design. A part of OST is finished and the work on sounds is in progress.\nIt is hard to estimate the volume of work on art, texts, and level design - the game requires as much content as possible to become more flexible and saturated. But we are going to finish core of the game by the end of the year.\nDuring the year, we plan to release an exclusive demo for backers - and we're looking into the possibility of creating a public demo after this.\nWe started working on UnDungeon more than a year ago, just as a hobby as a change from the boring office routine. The history and concept elements of the game were combined from lots of various notes, sketches, ideas (that were impossible to release during a full-time at office), and all features that other games lack.\nNone of us believed that the game would become such a big project. We were confident that it was impossible because of our daily jobs. Meanwhile, our idea was getting more concrete and detailed, the first animations appeared, and the first line of code was written.\nLater on, we realized that we loved this game and wanted to finish it at any cost. But to implement all our ideas we needed financing.\nAll that we have so far has been achieved without any financial support. And we don't want to find an investor or become a part of an already existing studio, because it seems vital to make the game as we see it. Therefore, Kickstarter is the only opportunity to get the necessary finances and not to lose the game of our dream. \nScout -  \u20ac10\n *EARLY BIRD* You become a part of the Shift!

A journey through our entire galaxy, the Milkey Way, would last 120.000 years...with the speed of light! and it contains of 300 billion stars. A journey to our nearest neighbor, the Andromeda galaxy, would last around 2.5 million years with that speed. And there we are, at the first tiny dot, next to our own tiny dot in the center of this very sphere. If you add the next 100 000 Galaxies you can see the structure of Laniakea, our home supercluster. Laniakea is around 160 megaparsec in size and of cause surrounded by even larger structures.\nThe diameter of the cloud of galaxies in the sphere is around 250 megaparsec (Mpc). One Parsec is equal to 3.2616 lightyears, which means, that the cloud is 815.400.000 lightyears in diameter. 815 million years of travel, with the speed of light, captured in an 8cm glass sphere. \nWith all these information, this sphere convinced me, that we can\u00b4t be alone in the universe. \nHow is it made?\nI took a katalogue of galaxies and chose every galaxy in a radius of 125 Mpc. I converted the data and found a company, which was able to laser these 675 758 galaxies into a glass sphere. Some galaxies were to close to each other, so they merged together. There are in total 380 000 dots in this 8cm (3.14\") sphere and it weights 0,8Kg (1,76lb). The inner structure reflects light, so it looks really nice, if you put it on an LED, but it is also really good to see without an extra light. The brightness changes with the perspective, so you can spend hours looking into the Sphere. It comes in a black gift box with black velvet inside.\nPLAY\n\nUniverse Sphere in it\u00b4s box.\nExtension:\nThese are some pictures of the Sphere on the polyamid bases on the LED-Base Plate.\n\"LED fitting Base\" on the \"LED Base Plate\"\nI finished the first bases you could buy as an extension. They will be 3D-printed in different colors and materials such as polyamid, steel and some precious metals like pure silver and gold coated brass.\nPLAY\n\nHexagonal Grid Base, Pure Silver\nHexagonas Base, Black Plastic\nRound Base, Black Plastic\nMy Motivation:\nThe idea of the Universe Sphere came to me, after I was watching the video \"the power of ten\" and the more recent video \"a cosmic voyage\".It showes how incredibly huge our observable universe is and I wanted to see the structure of our universe in 3D with my bare eyes. So I decided to create a more concrete view of it, by lasering this tremendous structure in a glass sphere. I was so impressed by what came out of that, that I decided to make it available for all the universe-loving people outside, who try to understand the gigantic dimension of the place we exist in. To make it affordable, I need to order a large amount of Spheres and for that...I need your help!  \nYou can watch the clip \"A Cosmic Voyage\" on youtube and I promise, it is mindblowing.\nDeutsch:\nZu der Struktur im Inneren:\nJeder gelaserte Punkt entspricht nicht nur einem Stern, sondern einer ganzen Galaxie mit milliarden von Sternen. Eine Reise durch unsere eigene Galaxie, der Milchstra\u00dfe, w\u00fcrde 120.000 Jahre dauern, mit Lichtgeschwindigkeit! Sie besteht aus ca. 300 milliarden Sternen. F\u00fcr eine Reise zu unserer Nachbargalaxie, der Andromeda Galaxie, w\u00fcrden 2,5 millionen Jahre ben\u00f6tigt. Und da w\u00e4ren wir nun bei dem n\u00e4chsten kleinen Punkt neben unserem kleinen Punkt angekommen. F\u00fcgt man diesen beiden Galaxien noch weitere 100 000 hinzu, erkennt man den Laniakea Supercluster, der wiederum von weiteren noch gr\u00f6\u00dferen Strukturen umgeben ist.\nDer Durchmesser der Punktewolke entspricht ca. 250 Megaparsec (Mpc). Ein Parsec entspricht 3,2616 Lichtjahren, was bedeutet, dass die Wolke einen Durchmesser von ca.815.400.000 Lichtjahren hat. Diese unvorstellbar gro\u00dfe Struktur, in der es 815 millionen Jahre dauern w\u00fcrde, mit Lichtgeschwindigkeit von einem Ende zum anderen Ende zu fliegen und in der 380.000 Punkte enthalten sind, kann man jetzt in einer 8cm gro\u00dfen Glaskugel in seiner eigenen Hand halten. \nDiese unvorstellbaren Mengen an Galaxien mit jeweils Millionen von Sternen, haben mir gezeigt, dass wir nicht alleine im Universum sein k\u00f6nnen.\nWie wird sie gefertigt:\nIch habe aus einem Galaxienkatalog alle Galaxien in einem Umkreis von 125 Mpc ausgew\u00e4hlt und diese so umgewandelt, dass eine Firma sie in eine Glasskugel lasern konnte. Aus 675 758 Galaxien wurden 380 000 Punkte, da einige f\u00fcr den Laser schlichtweg zu nah aneinander lagen. Die Kugel misst 8cm im Durchmesser,  wiegt ca. 800gramm und wird in einer schwarzen Geschenkbox geliefert. Die Struktur im inneren reflektiert Licht, sodass sie von verschiedenen Perspektiven unterschiedlich hell wirkt. Man k\u00f6nnte sie gut auf einen beleuchteten Sockel stellen aber auch ohne Lichtquelle sieht sie fantastisch aus, sodass man Stundenlang ins Innere der Kugel starren kann.\nErweiterung:\nMomentan arbeite ich an 3D-gedruckten Sockeln f\u00fcr die Kugeln, die ich freischalten m\u00f6chte, sobald das Projekt sein Finanzierungsziel erreicht hat.\nMeine Motivation:\nDie Idee der Universe Sphere kam mir, nachdem ich das Video \"a cosmic voyage\" auf Youtube gesehen habe. Es zeigt, wie unglaublich gro\u00df das beobachtbare Universum ist und in was f\u00fcr einer fantastischen Struktur die Galaxien angeordnet sind. Diese Struktur wollte ich gerne mit blo\u00dfen Augen in 3D sehen k\u00f6nnen. Daraufhin habe ich recherchiert, woher ich die Koordinaten der Galaxien bekommen kann, wie ich diese umwandele und letztenendes habe ich eine Firma gefunden, die mit meinen Daten eine Glasskugel lasern konnte.

The facility was complete in 1969, located deep below the pastoral countryside of M\u00e4lar\u00f6arna. The local population called this marvel of technology The Loop.\nAcclaimed scifi artist Simon St\u00e5lenhag\u2019s paintings of Swedish 1980s suburbia, populated by fantastic machines and strange beasts, have spread like wildfire on the Internet. St\u00e5lenhag\u2019s portrayal of a childhood against a backdrop of old Volvo cars and coveralls, combined with strange and mystical machines, creates a unique atmosphere that is both instantly recognizable and utterly alien.\nNow, for the first time, YOU will get the chance to step into the amazing world of the Loop. With your help, we will be able to create a beautiful printed RPG book about the Tales from the Loop.\nThis game is our third international RPG, after the critically acclaimed Mutant: Year Zero and Coriolis - The Third Horizon. The lead writer is the seasoned Swedish game writer Nils Hintze, backed up by the entire Free League team who handle project management, editing, and graphic design.\nAdditional writing in the game will be done by the award-winning and best-selling game writer and author Matt Forbeck, with twenty-seven novels and countless games published to date. Matt will be writing the alternative US campaign setting (read more below).\nAll art in the game is of course done by Simon St\u00e5lenhag himself. Most of the art will be drawn from the pages of the Tales from the Loop artbook - many scenarios in the game are based directly on illustrations in the artbook - but the RPG will contain some new original art as well, including the cover image.\nThe book will have approximately 150-200 pages, in the US Letter format.\n  Worried about backing a Kickstarter with Christmas approaching? We have you covered! We aim to finish a complete BETA PDF of the game and send it to all backers before Christmas Day! So, why not let the Tales from the Loop RPG be your Christmas gift for yourself or a scifi-loving friend?\nWe expect to ship the printed game in February.\nWere you a backer in the kickstarter for the Tales from the Loop artbook last year? As you may remember, this RPG, in PDF format, was actually a stretchgoal in that campaign. All backers in the previous kickstarter will get a complete PDF of this game at no added cost. This new kickstarter is for the printed version of the game.\n  In this pen&paper roleplaying game, you play teenagers in the late Eighties, solving Mysteries connected to the Loop. Choose between character Types such as the Bookworm, the Troublemaker, the Popular Kid and the Weirdo! Everyday Life is full of nagging parents, never-ending homework and classmates bullying and being bullied.\nThe Mysteries let the characters encounter the strange machines and weird creatures that have come to haunt the countryside after the Loop was built. The kids get to escape their everyday problems and be part of something meaningful and magical - but also dangerous.\nThe core rulebook will contain several complete Mysteries to play and a complete campaign setting, based on the M\u00e4lar\u00f6arna islands outside of Stockholm. In addition, the core rulebook will include an alternative campaign setting in a US location, based on Boulder City, Nevada. The US setting text will be written by the award-winning game writer and author Matt Forbeck.\n  The game engine of Tales from the Loop RPG is based on our previous game Mutant: Year Zero, that was awarded with a Silver ENnie for Best Rules at Gencon 2015, and used also in Coriolis - The Third Horizon.\nThe core mechanic is the same: To make a skill roll, you simply grab a number of dice for your attribute score, skill level and gear, and roll them all together. You need at least one six to succeed, and extra sixes can give bonus effects.\nThis core mechanic is of course adapted and expanded to support the themes of Tales from the Loop. The rules focus less on conflict and combat, more on exploration, relationships and the characters' needs to balance solving Mysteries with their everyday life as schoolkids.\n  With your help, we can make Tales from the Loop RPG even more amazing. Below are the stretchgoals we have lined up if we exceed our initial funding goal.\nSTRETCHGOAL 1: HARDCOVER BOOK \u2013 UNLOCKED!\nIf we reach this goal, we will print Tales from the Loop RPG with a top-quality hardback cover.\n STRETCHGOAL 2: MAP OF M\u00c4LAR\u00d6ARNA \u2013 UNLOCKED!\nIf we reach this goal, we will print a large full-color map of M\u00e4lar\u00f6arna, the main game setting.

Tales from the Loop was ranked by The Guardian as one of the \u201c10 Best Dystopias,\u201d in the company of works such as Franz Kafka\u2019s The Trial and Andrew Niccol\u2019s Gattaca.\nNot only have St\u00e5lenhag\u2019s unique and cinematic images earned him a worldwide fan base, but have also made him a go-to storyteller, concept artist and illustrator for both the film and computer gaming industry. Simon St\u00e5lenhag\u2019s work can be seen in films such as Searching for Sugarman (2012), directed by Malik Bendjeloull, and in games such as Ripple Dot Zero (2013).\nSimon St\u00e5lenhag\u2019s Facebook page\nDuring his ten years as a game writer, Nils Hintze has written a great number of scenarios, articles and reviews.

Thank you in advance for understanding, please pledge responsibly.\n\nKingdom Death: Monster 1.5\nKingdom Death Monster is an massive cooperative board game about survival in a nightmare-horror world. Survivors fight for their lives against an onslaught of bizarre and fearsome creatures. They will use the fruits of these battles to build a fragile civilization in a place where humans are at the bottom of a monstrous ecology. \nInitially, I brought the concept for Monster to Kickstarter in order to make a far-away dream into a reality. The runaway train of success helped pack the game with more original art, in-depth gameplay, and fantastically sculpted minis than even I dreamed of. A game this size could not feasibly be made without the community of supportive backers we found on Kickstarter. It's too expensive to produce and too vivid for distribution.\nThrough the experience of kickstarting Monster, I found a group of people that shares my vision for a blisteringly difficult game with a continually emerging story. I am truly humbled to share it with the world.\nNow there isn't a single factory sealed copy at KD HQ. There are still people asking if there will ever be more so I'm back on Kickstarter to launch a campaign for a new edition. I want to print updated rules, great new expansions, even more content and (with your help) many surprises!!!\nKingdom Death: Monster 1.5 Changelog\nAdd-Ons\n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                         The Gambler's Chest\nGambler's Rolls\n                                                                                                                                                                                                     First Hero Expansion\nIn the First Hero Expansion, players take the role of 4 veteran survivors who have no settlement to call their own. They find and invade a settlement where they face the First Hero, a survivor so powerful, they do all the hunting by themselves! The purpose of this expansion is to help players start more advanced campaigns at Lantern Year 12 or 20. Instead of simply providing complicated rules to generate later settlements, your showdown with the First Hero will create the advanced settlement that you can take over.\n Kingdom Death: Monster\nShipping Details & Shipping Waves\nOne thing we've learned from managing the impossibly huge number of reward combinations from our first campaign is to strike a balance between timely delivery of rewards to our eager fans and being logistically responsible to our staff and partners. So here's what we've decided about shipping rewards for this campaign.\n\nWe have set the estimated delivery of all pledge levels to December 2020. This is a best case scenario, in case our campaign gets insanley huge! 3-4 years development, production & transportation cycle to 100% finish every promise we might make during this campaign is realistic.  \nRewards from this Kickstarter will ship in waves that will be determined by the final scope of this campaign. Each wave's shipping costs will be collected through a pledge manager (most likely backerkit) when the goods are ready to ship. Shipping costs will reflect the actual cost to ship your pledge and any additional rewards you selected from that wave.\nLike our previous campaign, we will make our best efforts to ease the burden of shipping by fulfilling rewards from shipping partners around the world (projected as: US, CA, EU, AU.)\nBackers are responsible for any and all import fees, VAT, duties, taxes, post office fees, and or any other fees their country or government imposes.\n\n*Core Games Ships Separately!\nThe Core Game is massive. To ensure its safety, it is being package into its own carton with corner protectors. It is too heavy to ship with other rewards. It would crush them!\nWave 1 - Estimated Delivery Summer 2017 Core Game / 1.5 Update Pack \nUnited States... $25 / $10 \nEuropean Union... $40 / $20 \nCanada... $30 / $15 Australia (+ New Zealand)... $40 / $20 \nRest of World... $100 / $30\n\nWave 2 - Estimated Delivery Winter 2017 (Still hoping for Summer 2017)\nCurrent Expansions\nUnited States... $15 + $3 per additional expansion \nEuropean Union... $15 + $3 per additional expansion\nCanada... $15 + $3 per additional expansion\nAustralia (+ New Zealand)... $15 + $3 per additional expansion  \nRest of World... $30 + $3 per additional expansion\nWave 3 - Estimated Delivery Spring 2018\nGambler's Box, Promo and cross-over figures\nUnited States... $20 + $2 per Add on\nEuropean Union... $20 + $2 per Add on\nCanada... $20 + $2 per Add on\nAustralia (+ New Zealand)... $20 + $2 per Add on\nRest of World... $30 + $2 per Add on\nWave 4 - Estimated Delivery Spring 2019 \nNew Expansions\nUnited States... $15 + $3 per additional expansion\nEuropean Union... $15 + $3 per additional expansion\nCanada... $15 + $3 per additional expansion\nAustralia (+ New Zealand)... $15 + $3 per additional expansion\nRest of World... $30 + $3 per additional expansion\nWave 5 & Beyond - Estimated Delivery Winter 2020\n???\nEven I don't know for 100% what may happen during this campaign.\nPlease note that the contents and prices of each wave are estimates and are subject to change depending on the final size of this campaign.\nPledges finalized after the pledge manager deadline passes will ship from the United States and will incur additional shipping costs and potential delays. Shipments that could not be delivered due to an inaccurately provided address (including failure to update an old address) will have additional costs to be reshipped. Due to the size of your rewards, we cannot ship to PO Boxes.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI learned a lot about manufacturing a top-quality boutique game and fulfilling it to our backers from our first Kickstarter. Not all my lessons were easy, but all of them were meaningful. Trying to bring such a staggeringly large game to life, we worked insane hours, fought lots of battles, and saw some unexpected setbacks. It's taught me how to look for ways to turn logistical, artistic, and fiscal difficulties into assets.\n\n\nI'm heading into this campaign with my eyes open. If this campaign meets with success we'll be on the hook to you guys for loads more quality content. The bigger we get, the more complex fulfillment will become.

Known as the The Rival Bikers Overdrive Tournament, or TRBO for short, biker clubs from all over come armed with lots of brawn, little brains, and a ton of dirty tricks to take home the title of the TRBO champions!\n    12 highly-detailed, chibi-biker miniatures\nA deck of Tune Up cards \n4 Custom Attack Dice \n4 Custom Defense dice\n3 custom movement dice\n1 custom boost die\n2 Royal Circuit board tiles\n  In TRBO each player takes control of a unique Biker Club composed of 3 biker types: light, medium, and heavy. Each club also has their own special power that can help them capture victory.\nWhile each biker has different attack and health values based on their size, all bikes are capable of moving at the same speed. It is up to the player to decide what\u2019s the best strategy for each member of their Club. Players move by rolling 3 custom movement dice. They can attribute any of the rolled results to any of their bikers. \n    If, during their move, a biker lands on or moves over an Active Boost space they get to finish their current move, roll the boost die and immediately move the rolled amount.  Boosting can help you get your bikers in range to attack your opponent by either Bashing or Blasting.\n  When two enemy bikes share a space the biker who\u2019s turn it is may make a bash attack. The attacking biker rolls the number of attack dice equal to their weight class while the defending biker rolls defense dice equal to their weight class. The attacking biker is looking for the club or critical symbol, while the defender is looking for the tire or critical symbol.\n    If a biker stops in a space behind an enemy, that biker may make a blast attack on any one enemy biker in a forward adjacent square. The attacking biker rolls the number of attack dice equal to their weight class while the defending biker rolls defense dice equal to their weight class. The attacking biker is looking for the blast or critical symbol, while the defender is looking for the tire or critical symbol.\n    If a biker lands on or moves over a Tune-Up space they get to draw a Tune-Up card to add to their hand. Tune-Up cards allow players to use a wide variety of special combat or move abilities on their turn, or play dirty tricks that can interrupt and disrupt their opponent's turn. \n  Players win by having the last Club riding. This can be done in one of two ways, by either wrecking all of their competitors\u2019 bikes through blasting, bashing, and playing dirty tricks, or out-pacing their opponents, leaving no competitors on the track.\nIt is totally legal, even encouraged, in the rules of the TRBO Tournament to wreck all of your opponents during the race. Go ahead and kick, punch, it's all in your mind, throw a shoe, bite a guy, do it all the time! Really, go ahead and do all sorts of  messed-up stuff to your competitors in order to win. This of course includes bashing your opponents with the heaviest thing you can find, or blasting them with explosion-iest thing you can find!\nA biker is wrecked when they\u2019ve been dealt enough damage to bring their hit points to zero. This can occur in one attack, or over the course of many attacks, depending on the luck of the attacker's rolls. If your Bike Club is the only one left riding then congratulate yourself, whilst also rubbing it in your competitors' faces, because you\u2019re the TRBO Tournament champion.\n  TRBO uses a \u201clapping system\u201d to keep the race track moving as long as there are rival bikers racing. To accommodate this the board is split into two sections: a lead section and a rear section. The lead section is always the section with the leading racers on it. The rear section is the section in, well\u2026the rear. It is pretty common in TRBO that one or more bikers will still be in the rear section when a leading racer reaches the end of the lead section and needs to continue moving.\nWhen that occurs the rear section is cleared of any obstacles that were placed on it, any wrecked bikers, and any active bikers. All of those items and bikers are out of the game. The recently cleared rear section is then placed in front of the only remaining section and the two pieces switch roles, the once rear section becomes the lead and the previously lead section becomes the rear. If a player moves swiftly enough it is possible for one or more of their club\u2019s bikes to clear all the other remaining bikers off the rear board, thus making them the last club riding and winning the game.\nWe'll be updating this section throughout the campaign with background histories of each of the clubs!\n                LIMITED QUANTITY\n    All shipping charges will be done after the Kickstarter campaign ends. These charges will be based on the actual costs of the rewards via the pledge manager which will open up post campaign. Here's a list of basic estimates for shipping/insurance.
