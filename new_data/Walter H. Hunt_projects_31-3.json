Also, some big last day news!!! ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs a seasoned business owner, I understand how things do not always go as planned. 2020 was definitely an example of that! There are some factors which are out of one's control, and human error must always be factored in. When this happens, problem solving and a commitment to make things right is paramount. I always endeavor to give the customer more than they expect with no gotchas. My experience has prepared me for this and my commitment to honoring my word is my main priority. Our backers will attest to the quality of response and service we provide. \n\nManufacturing and supply chain difficulties are the biggest risk to this project. We have taken several steps to minimize this risk:\n\nFirst, I have been involved significantly in every step of this project from inception; prototyping, working with qualified engineers, costing and quality control of manufacturing. I went so far as to personally finance, at significant expense, an initial low volume run of tables to make sure these tables did what I said they would, and to ensure that we could manufacture these with the quality I expect. The result was a product I am very proud of. This knowledge and being so active in the \"day to day processes\" allows me to personally oversee this project.\n\nSecondly, our Game Toppers are made in the USA. I am working with a manufacture that is based in my home town. They have many large accounts like Target, Best Buy and others, in a 90,000 square ft. facility, that has equipped them to handle the quality and the capacity this project demands. It also provides us many key advantages as far as quality control, problem solving, supply chain and mitigating problems that can happen versus manufacturing overseas.\n\nThirdly, shipping is always a challenge. We have purchased a 5000 Sq ft facility in our home town to manage inventory and the pick and pull process of our topper orders which we have been running on our own since Feb of 2019. Our Game Toppers are somewhat heavy packages. Considerable time and effort has gone into making sure our fulfillment partner in the EU can handle the shipping in a timely manner. We also have been testing our packaging to ensure our Toppers arrive in pristine condition. Because of this I have made significant upgrades in our packaging to ensure a quality delivery. our second delivered campaign has seen lower shipping failure and improved response time due to our implementations.\n\nWe are charging for shipping. I am making sound business decisions so I have enough funds to pay to get them to you. Our Toppers are over sized for the shipping category. The world is currently upside down in this segment or economy, and it's a worldwide problem. We see it easing in the future, but have prepared for the worst to ensure we can stand by our commitments. Our improvements in package engineering have proven well worth it! While we realize it costs a bit more to ship, this was an intentional design decision to provide the best quality, comfort and functionality that gamers desire. We could have made a smaller Topper with 2 inch rails and not offered the versatility that our design offers, but I refused to compromise on this. The small amount of extra shipping, I feel is worth it in the long run.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nLong-lasting design\nComponents are extremely well designed and durable goods\nReusability and recyclability\nbuilt to stand test of time.

Hunt", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "In Theurgy, you take on the role of a half-forgotten god who wishes to restore their name to its former glory. \nAt the beginning of the game, you have only a pair of loyal acolytes and a handful of followers situated at the rural edges of a faithless world. However, as the game progresses, whole towns and cities will pledge their devotion to you... or else they shall perish by your hand. \nWelcome to a land in which epic pilgrimages are undertaken, incredible miracles performed, and fantastical beasts summoned as jealous gods clash in a fierce contest for recognition and reverence.\nnew monster meeple designs revealed in update #6\nPlease be aware that these images are not to scale and that the the final pieces may look slightly different from those pictured here. The custom action pawns,  acolytes, anomaly tokens, and engraved disks are digital mockups.  Although we think the artwork already looks pretty cool, it is not finalised and our artists will be adding in extra details after the Kickstarter to really make it pop. The photos on this page, like the one below, are of our prototype.\n Minimal Downtime: On their turn, a player has at most four actions to choose from. These actions are easy to execute and require very little upkeep, so play moves around the table very quickly. \nHigh Replayability: With a modular board, variable player powers, multiple paths to victory, and hundreds of unique cards, no two games of Theurgy are ever alike.\nEmergent Complexity: Complex game states and strategic dilemmas emerge from a very simple ruleset which can be learnt as you play. \nLimited Luck: How you manage your hand is much more important than which cards you draw, and a well-executed plan is the only way to guarantee the spread of your mythological religion. \nHeavy Interaction: There just isn't enough room on the board for players to quietly build up their empires and wait until the endgame. Players brush up against their neighbours almost immediately, and deciding which settlements to contest and which to abandon can be critical. \nThe aim of Theurgy is to be the first to achieve one of three victory conditions, all of which involve building temples:\nEstablish the Official Faith: Build X temples, one of which must be in the Capital. \nFulfil Your Calling: Build X+1 temples and fulfil your Divine Calling.\nSpread Across the Land: Build X+2 temples anywhere across the land. \nWhere 'X' varies with the player count. In order to build these temples, you will need to direct your acolytes and command your followers using four simple actions.\nMove your acolytes and any number of your followers into neighbouring settlements. Along the way, your acolytes may either preach to convert a local to your cause, or fight a fantastical beast to protect your following from the ill will of your rivals.\nPilgrimages are an effective way to grow your religion and to carve out a territory to call your own. However, they should be planned carefully. Spread your following too thinly, and you risk being overwhelmed by your opponents. Concentrate your following too heavily, and they become a target for hungry monsters and devastating miracles. \nMark your growing cultural influence in the surrounding settlements by placing a faith token or (if your following is large enough) replace a rival's token with your own. The greater your influence in a settlement, the easier it will be for you to construct a temple there when the people's faith is tested.\nSpread the Word is the simplest and often the most powerful way of strengthening your hold on new territories, but it is also the slowest. Placing and guarding faith tokens requires a considerable investment in time and followers.  \nAllow your acolyte to channel your divine power to perform incredible miracles, or summon fantastical monsters to wreak havoc in your competitor's settlements.\nDivine Intervention actions allow you to dramatically alter your position with powerful and often unpredictable effects. However, even gods have their limitations. The effectiveness of your interventions will very much depend on timing and the positioning of your own and rival acolytes, so plan carefully. \nTrigger a catastrophic or fantastical event in a settlement of your choice to see which god the people turn to. If that god is you, then they will build a temple in your honour. If not, then they will cast your temples down into ruins...\nTest the Faith is perhaps the most important action in the game, since this is how you build the temples needed to fulfil the victory conditions. The key to success in Theurgy is being able to anticipate how the locals' allegiances will shift when their faith is tested. \nAs with Divine Intervention, timing is key. Build your temples too quickly, and your rivals will rush to tear them down. Build your temples too slowly, and you'll be consigned to the history books...\nIn Theurgy, two or more gods compete for temples. However, we know that it's not always possible to find that second player. We also know that, no matter how many of you there are, it can be nice to vary your player count from time to time. That's why we've been working on Theurgy's 'AI Mode'. \nIn order to introduce an AI into the game, flip over a player mat to its AI side. Because all the deity boards are double sided, solo players will get the chance to play as or against any of the gods. You may play against a single AI opponent for a straightforward two-player experience, or seamlessly integrate an AI into a game with a higher player count. You could even play against multiple AIs at once.\nBe warned, though, that these AIs play with some advantages to compensate them for their lack of human intelligence. Each AI god has a different ability and acts more swiftly, cycling through three actions rather than four. This means that they can spread across the land and build their temples fast. You\u2019ll quickly discover that defeating an AI is no walk in the park.\nPlaying with AIs is straightforward, fast, and a highly recommended experience for not only solo gamers but for anyone who wants to put their Theurgy skills to the test.\nThe AI Mode is still in development and the AI rulebook needs to be finalised, but so far the reactions from our playtesters and reviewers have been overwhelmingly positive!\nIn Theurgy, rival gods are just one of your problems. The other is a Guild of Alchemists who seek to explain away supernatural phenomena as part of the ordinary course of nature. \nWhenever you Test the Faith in a settlement with a spectacular event, the Guild gets to work in the neighbouring towns and villages to provide a secular account of the anomaly. So, you need to be concious of which settlements you're testing and when. Test the Faith too often in your own territory, and you'll find the Guild's influence growing on your doorstep. \nThe influence of the Guild is represented by Sceptic Tokens. Scepticism can build up quickly, especially in the Capital and the Inner Ring of towns and cities. Importantly, if left unchecked, scepticism can make it almost impossible for players to win over the people's faith and construct temples. \nThe best way to deal with scepticism is to perform a miracle or summon a monster. After all, it is tricky to stay sceptical when a Manticore flies down and eats the local baker...\nMiracle cards have powerful and immediate one-time effects which can dramatically alter the state of play. However, while the gods of Theurgy are powerful, they are not all-powerful, and so these miracles have their limitations...\nFirst, each player has a hand limit of just three miracles to choose from. Players must therefore work hard to find the best way to use the cards available to them. \nSecond, miracles may only be performed on a Divine Intervention action. Since players are generally prevented from taking the same action on subsequent turns, you need to carefully plan out your miracles in advance. \nThird, miracles must be carried out by one of your two acolytes. Since the majority of miracles have location-specific effects, this makes the positioning of your acolytes key. There's no point bringing blight and decay to an empty settlement!\nRelatedly, if a rival walks an acolyte up to one of your temples during a pilgrimage, you have some time to react. Maybe they're just passing through, or maybe they're here to burn your temple to the ground... \nYou may have noticed that we've recently updated the names of our miracle cards so that they now read as divine commands. \"Floods\" just didn't sound epic enough. Now your acolyte must \"Drown Them Under a Great Wave\". \nWhereas miracles are played from your own hand, monsters are summoned from a common pool. \nImportantly, monsters may only be summoned into a settlement of a suitable type. The Troll, for example, may only be summoned into a Mine and the Shapeshifter may only be summoned into a Marsh. \nOnce summoned, roaming monsters may move into neighbouring settlements on future turns. Territorial monsters, on the other hand, entrench themselves in their new lairs.   \nUnlike miracles, monsters have an ongoing effect and there is no limit to the number of monsters that you may have under your control.  Each monster either has a permanent passive effect or an active ability which may be used each time you take a Divine Intervention action in the future. Therefore, the more monsters you control, the more powerful your Divine Interventions become. \nHowever, monsters require careful management. You will need to make sure you defend your most useful monsters from rival acolytes. Monsters are powerful, but not powerful enough to stand up to those channelling the strength of a god...\nExcept of course for the six legendary monsters. These monsters require two acolytes to slay and have a massive, dramatic impact in the settlements unfortunate enough to become their home.\nWe're determined to do everything we can to keep the manufacture and distribution of Theurgy as environmentally friendly and ethical as possible. This means:\nExclusively using certified sustainably sourced materials.\n  Investing in high-quality, long-lasting components.\n  Exclusively working with partners with the highest ethical employment practices.\nYou can read the full details of our environmental and ethical commitments in the final section down below.\n8 Custom Printed Cloth Bags: \u00a314\nYou can use these eight beautiful custom printed cloth bags to store all the pieces for each deity, as well as the sceptics and monsters. Above you can see the designs we've had made for two of our deities, Orrun and Aeoris.\nApproximate Size (width x height): 100m x 150mm\nPurchase separately in the pledge manager after the campaign. \nWhat can I expect for future stretch goals?\nOur stretch goals will involve upgrading the components and commissioning new artwork that we just couldn't afford otherwise.   \nWhere are the minis?\nWe love the world of Theurgy and really want our components to bring that world to life in the best way possible. We certainly thought about minis, but in the end decided that custom meeples fit the overall look and feel of the game a bit better. We are the Ministry of Meeples after all...\n Shipping will be charged after the campaign through a pledge manager. \nAlso, please be aware that the prices quoted above are only estimates and are subject to change. That said, we have endeavoured to make these estimates as accurate as possible. \nWe will prepay the duties and taxes, including VAT, for the backers who receive their games in the EU, US, Canada, UK, and Australia. \n*Europe Zone 1: Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Lichtenstein, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Monaco, Switzerland.\n*Europe Zone 2: Estonia, Finland, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden. \n*Unfortunately we are unable to ship to the following countries: Afghanistan, Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia, Congo, Eritrea, Ivory Coast, Guina-Bassau, Haiti, Iran, Iraq, Liberia, Libya, Myanmar, Niger, North Korea, Russia, Somalia, South Africa, Sudan, Syria, Ukraine, and Yemen.  ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nSince this is our first Kickstarter project, we have taken special care to mitigate the risks and challenges associated with the development and delivery of Theurgy. We are working with a German manufacturer, Ludo Fact, well-known for their timely and high quality productions. Our fulfilment partners, Ludo Packt, Quartermaster Logistics, Aetherworks, and Zatu, all likewise have excellent reputations for delivering rewards to their backers without incident.\n\nBrexit has caused a bit of a headache for everyone who works with partners in the EU, and especially for small independent businesses like ourselves. Fortunately, Ludo Packt have a long history of shipping to the UK and have already begun guiding us through each step of the new process.\n\nOur aim is to turn The Ministry of Meeples into a trusted household name and to build a big community around our games. We are therefore entirely committed to exceeding our backers' expectations at every stage of the process.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nLong-lasting design\nTheurgy's core components will be manufactured by Ludo Fact, an industry-leading German manufacturer. Ludo Fact's production quality is extremely high, and as the game does not include any fragile pieces, each copy should have a long and happy life!\nReusability and recyclability\nAll of the wood, paper, and cardboard used by Ludo Fact are recyclable. So, if ever you did want to throw Theurgy out, you could recycle almost the whole thing. Of course, we're confident that you're not going to want to throw it out! You're going to want to play the game again and again and again... ;)\nSustainable materials\nLudo Fact have a very impressive record when it comes to using sustainable materials. In fact, this is the main reason we've chosen to work with them.\n\nMany of the game's pieces are wood, and Ludo Fact exclusively uses wood from sustainable forestry. All of Ludo Fact's suppliers are FSC- or PEFC certified, and so is Ludo Fact.\n\nLudo Fact only uses cardboard with the highest possible percentage of recycled materials.\n\nAll colours and coating used in the manufacturing process are water-based and non-toxic.\n\nWherever we can, we will avoid using plastic. Currently, our plan is to use flowpacks made from paper instead of small plastic bags. These flowpacks can also be recycled to make more paper!\n\nOur Printed Bags will be manufactured by The Cotton Bag Company. The Cotton Bag Company works exclusively with eco-friendly fabrics and water-based inks. \n\nOur Monster Meeples will most likely be manufactured by Meeple Studio in Poland. All of the wood used by Meeple Studio is local Polish wood from forests which are PEFC or FSC certified.\nEnvironmentally friendly factories\nLudo Fact uses exclusively green energy. Their affiliate, Vento Ludens, have realised projects which produce 130 million kilowatt hours of electricty through wind, water, and solar panel plants.\nSustainable Distribution\nLike Ludo Fact, our primary fulfillment partner, Ludo Packt, also uses exclusively green energy.\n\nOur manufacturing will take place in Germany, rather than China, so that there is a shorter distance for our product to travel to our main customer base in the EU and UK.\nSomething else\nWe have endeavoured to manufacturer as many of the components of Theurgy as possible within Europe. This in order to have the greatest confidence that everyone involved in the production process works in safe conditions and is paid fairly. \n\nCurrently, the only components which are manufactured outside of Europe are the Printed Bags from the Cotton Bag Co. However, The Cotton Bag Co exclusively work with factories which are SEDEX or SE8000 compliant (i.e. factories which have proved to uphold the highest ethical work practices) and endeavour to use shipping instead of air freight wherever possible in order to keep their environmental impact to a minimum.", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a31 or more", "title": "Follower Pledge Level", "descp": "Follow along with the campaign and help us make Theurgy awesome!

The elders, reading this as the return of Aquila, enter the Oracle to find the altar piled high with Radiants, fabled orbs of power bestowed by Aquila and once used to fight back the darkness.\nEach noble gathered for the solstice celebration takes a Radiant from the altar. Most depart to guard their holdings from the dark times the Radiants imply, but you few Dukes and Duchesses stay to give thanks to Aquila for these wondrous gifts.\nAs the solstice fades into night, battle horns sound in the east and ghastly monsters, drawn by Aquila\u2019s light, descend upon the Oracle of Thyne and clammer to breach its walls.\nThe scattered tribes of monster-kin have harried Valeria since the first brick was laid for its first city, but now they fight together. Orcs battle alongside Gnolls. Goblins create contraptions for the Undead. Something has united them in a common cause\u2014to destroy Valeria.\nAquila\u2019s light brightens, the roots of the Oracle tremor, and the elders call out, \u201cShe returns! Hold back the darkness!\u201d You draw your blades and ready your spells to face the enemies of light.\nThis Room + Monster Task will be in Book 7 of all copies of Darksworn\nThis Final Room will be included with all copies of Darksworn.\nThis Final Room will be included with all copies of Darksworn.\nThis Final Room will be included with all copies of Darksworn.\nThis card will be added to Book 7 of all copies of Darksworn\nThe Hatchery will be included in Book 7 of every Kickstarter copy of Darksworn.\n\nThe Fire Temple Monsters will be included in every Kickstarter copy of Darksworn. If you're not getting Darksworn, you'll be able to add this Pack in the Pledge Manager.\nThe Kaharian Monsters will be included in every Kickstarter copy of Darksworn. If you're not getting Darksworn, you'll be able to add this Pack in the Pledge Manager.\nThe Shade Events will be included in every Kickstarter copy of Darksworn. If you're not getting Darksworn, you'll be able to add this Pack in the Pledge Manager.\nDarksworn introduces cooperative play to Valeria: Card Kingdoms through a story-driven narrative in which your game group are Dukes or Duchesses working together to push back an ancient darkness that threatens the land. During the game, you will be slaying Monsters, recruiting Citizens, praying to Aquila for Blessings, and completing Tasks from a series of Books that reveal the saga of your adventures.\nEach of the 6 Books in the Darksworn Saga is a structured deck of cards and punchboard that introduce new rules that change Valeria: Card Kingdoms into a fully cooperative game. Your game group will set out on a Holy Quest to expand the Kingdom westward and defeat a growing darkness threatening the land and people of Valeria. Every Book starts out with new rules and sets your group against new Monsters, then spins out an expanding storyline that ties your rolls and Citizenry into the tasks and threats awaiting you.  \nSitting above the Monster Row, this board displays the current Book, shows the Book\u2019s new rules, and has an oubliette to hold captured Citizen cards.\nSet between the Story board and the Monster Row, these tiles define the Monster attack columns. When your roll matches any of these numbers the Monster card in that column attacks your Citizen stacks.\nThere are 9 new Monster cards that get added to an assortment of Monsters from the base game and expansions. Together they form the Monster deck with only 5 Monsters active at any one time. If you slay a Monster, that column can\u2019t attack this turn, buying your Citizens a brief respite from the carnage.\nBetween the Monster Row and the Citizens are the Walls. They offer some protection from most of the Monsters but walls get damaged, walls fail, and then the screaming starts. Luckily, there are ways you can re-build the walls...if you have any Actions left.\nActually, there are no new Citizens in this expansion. Instead, you can use any of the Citizens in the base game or any other VCK expansion to outfit your Citizen Stacks. Don\u2019t get too attached to them, though; Monsters love to capture or banish Citizens.\nBelow the Citizen Stacks, you\u2019ll find the Aquila Board. Here you can use a Prayer Action and spend Victory Points to activate one of Aquila's Blessings on display. These useful boons will ease your efforts to push back the darkness.\nYou may have noticed that there is one permanent Blessing on the Aquila Board...Spend 8VP to Rebuild 1 Wall. Along with that, there is also a deck of 12 Blessings with a 3-card draft line to give you a variety of other useful Blessings to assist you.\nEach player receives a special Starting Card \u2013 Explorer. This Citizen card will reward players when all seems bleak (none of your Citizens match the rolled dice) and in times of celebration (rolled doubles). No one should be without an Explorer.\nMost of the Books include punchboard tokens to represent certain special Monsters, deadly effects, looming terrors, or magical benefits. You\u2019ll discover all of these and more as you progress through the Books.\n\nValeria: Card Kingdoms \u2013 2nd Edition\nThis new edition of the Valeria: Card Kingdoms base game will have a lower MSRP than the original so that more gamers can enter the amazing game universe we launched back in 2015. It will have a new system of tracker boards, tokens, and +10 markers to count resources, and the box's plastic insert will have a special well to store the track boards. VCK2E will also include a new set of monster-based event cards that were not part of the original game components.\nValeria: Card Kingdoms \u2013 Flames & Frost Reprint \nValeria: Card Kingdoms \u2013 Crimson Seas Reprint\nFlames & Frost has been out of print for more than a year and Crimson Seas stock is running really low, now is the perfect time to reprint these major VCK expansions so that more Valeria gamers can get the full experience. The 2nd expansion, Shadowvale, is still available and can be purchased on our web store at a reduced price with immediate shipping.\nExpansion Pack #1: King's Guard\nExpansion Pack #2: Undead Samurai\nThese two expansion packs were release with the original edition of Valeria: Card Kingdoms back in 2015 and they've been out of print for nearly two years. We're pleased to bring them back here so that new and old fans can fill out their Valeria collections. As a special bonus, this pack now includes the Undead Samurai Rider, which was previously only available as a promo card.\nIf you've been collecting everything for Valeria: Card Kingdoms since 2015 and protecting your cards with premium weight sleeves, and if you got our Valeria Big Box back in 2018, then it probably looks something like this...\nThere's about a half-inch of space in each card well if the cards are crammed as tightly as possible. But if you do that, then you can't get your fingers in there to pull out the cards, and there's definitely not enough room for the 105 cards, 12 dividers, 1 tuck box, 2 folding boards, and the assorted wall and column tokens you'll be getting with Darksworn. So, here's our solution...\nCheck out the Add-Ons information a little further down the page and think about the storage solution you might need now to keep growing your VCK collection.\nThe items you select to add-on to your pledge will ship with your pledge level rewards when the project is fulfilled. \n\nENGLISH Add-Ons: If you have pledged for one of the ENGLISH pledge levels, you'll be able to select your add-ons during your pledge and Kickstarter will total up your list and automatically adjust your pledge for the full amount.\nGERMAN & FRENCH Add-Ons: If you have pledged at one of the GERMAN or FRENCH pledge levels, the items marked above as German Add-On or French Add-On can be added in the pledge manager after the campaign is over. You can add the value of your desired add-ons now by adjusting the Bonus amount in your pledge. Here is a graphic that detailing the Kickstarter process. Doing it now will help the project's perceived success, but you can just wait and do all the picking and paying in the pledge manager later, if you wish.\nAdd-Ons and Shipping: Please remember that in most cases, adding-on more products will increase the weight of your rewards package and could increase your shipping charges beyond the estimates provided in the Shipping section, below. Shipping will be calculated and collected in the pledge manager after the campaign has ended.\nAdding-On Older Products: We cannot offer add-ons for other products not part of this printing project because existing products are stored in different warehouses than Kickstarter rewards. However, we have many more Valeria products available for purchase and immediate shipment in our website shop \u2013 and almost everything is on sale during this Kickstarter campaign.  \nWe sent the resource tracking boards to previewer along with the Darksworn prototype, but forgot to mention that those boards are actually a part of VCK 2nd Edition, not Darksworn. So, naturally, some thought the trackers came inside the Darksworn box. That is not the case. The tracker boards are inside the VCK2E box, but if you're not getting that product, you can add the tracking boards onto your pledge, separately.\n\n\nEstimated Gamer Shipping\nShipping will be charged in the Pledge Manager after the funding project ends. Actual postage will be weight-based and packages will ship from hubs in the USA, Canada, Germany, Australia, and China.

We realize that the publication of a board game can be complicated and, no matter how experienced the project creators and mangers are, some problems may occur. In an effort to reduce the likelihood of delays and mistakes, we have taken several steps to prepare for success: \n\n1. This game project is in the hands of two well-seasoned professionals. David MacKenzie has been running Kickstarter projects since 2010 and Isaias Vallejo comes from a digital games background as production and studio director at Big Fish Games. \n\n2. We are dedicated to backer communication and feedback. We are actively involved in the Comments section of each Kickstarter project and keep backers up to date with plenty of updates during and after the funding process. Throughout every campaign, we are as transparent about the process and as open to feedback as possible without jeopardizing production and delivery timelines. \n\n3. We have completed significant pre-production art, graphic design, and translations with the exception of the stretch goals. This will allow us to expedite file prep and get the files to printer in a timely fashion. \n\n4. We have our manufacturer lined up and ready to begin the pre-press process as soon as the files are delivered. We hope that everything goes as planned, but if something falls through the cracks, we are ready and willing to employ every tool at our disposal to get the project back on track and running smoothly. \n\nThank you for your support!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "ENGLISH Custom Pledge", "descp": "Get all the updates and be a part of our support network.\nYou will be able to add-on items now through Kickstarter's Add-On System and in the Pledge Manager after the campaign has ended.\nAfter the campaign has ended, shipping costs will be calculated and collected in the Pledge Manager based on the combined weight of your selected products.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["342 backers", "Add-ons"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 15 or more", "title": "ENGLISH Darksworn PNP Files", "descp": "All backers at this pledge level or higher will receive a download link to the PNP files for the VCK Darksworn expansion when we submit the files to the printer.\nAdditional PNP files for Daily Magic Games titles can be purchased directly through https://www.pnparcade.com", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2021"}], "stat": ["15 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 29 or more", "title": "ENGLISH Darksworn", "descp": "One copy of the Darksworn expansion and all applicable unlocked stretch goals.\nCheck the add-ons list on the project page and adjust your pledge as needed for any extra items you'd like to get with your backer rewards.\nAfter the campaign has ended, shipping costs will be calculated and collected in the Pledge Manager based on the combined weight of your selected products.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["1,540 backers", "Add-ons"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 29 or more", "title": "GERMAN Darksworn", "descp": "One copy of the GERMAN Darksworn expansion and all unlocked Darksworn stretch goals.\nNo add-ons are allowed for this pledge level.\nInsured, trackable, and VAT pre-paid shipping for 1, 2, or all 3 items will be $14 to Germany or $20 to Austria.

In 2020, together we released dry brushes that helped new and advanced painters take their gaming miniatures to the next level! The combined 4,644 BACKERS most frequently asked question is \"Do you make smaller sizes?\" Well, NOW I DO. If you're ready to join the army of painters, hobbyists, gamers, crafters, terrain builders and artists you found the campaign you were looking for.\nGhosTiny Ultra Fine Detail Paint Brush Set is the answer to the question \"will you make a size #000?\" Instead of a single new brush added to the mega popular Ghost Brush line I wanted to create a set that will be your go to when you need to conquer the smallest of details packed into the wonderful miniatures and models we paint today! You probably already know the feeling of using wonderful new paint brushes but I invite you to join the #GhostBrush community and crush your hobby painting goals!\n \"Art is never finished, only abandoned.\"  Leonardo da Vinci\n\nMy name is Jeff Beyer. We met the last two years when 4,644 Backers gave me their trust and support in helping bring the Ghost Miniature Paintbrushes to life! With online sales, retail shops, and the last two Kickstarter campaigns, thousands of people are painting with these brushes! You can find me on Youtube under the name RedBeardBoss and on Instagram @Sleepwalkair_brush and I love painting. These past years we showed the bigger companies we wanted quality miniature painting supplies at a fair price. I'm not interested in charging you to cover the bill so I can hire big name studio painters in an attempt to convince you these brushes will bring you 1st place golden trophies. I could send every hobby channel on Youtube a free set and pay them to tell you how great these are but I'm not going to do that either. All you have to do is read the comments from the last TWO campaigns and feel proud knowing you are helping build a community of painters and hobbyists who simply love putting paint on little plastic figures.\nPrecision\nWith your support, we will help thousands of new artists fall in love with miniature painting.\nThank you for taking the time to check out my Kickstarter and happy painting!\nI would like to introduce you to the GhosTiny Ultra Fine Detail Miniature Paint Brush Set.\n\nThis new set of 9 ultra fine detail brushes includes 7 rounds, a flat, and a chisel shaped brush. These not only cover you for the smallest of miniature details but imagine the confidence in being able to choose the perfect shape and size for the task! This set is made with the same beloved white nylon hair of the other Ghost Paint Brushes. The birch wood handles of the new GhosTiny range are thicker and more comfortable to hold when you're focused on getting those tiny highlights in those hard to reach spaces.\nAccuracy\nUltra Fine Point\nDon't forget the original Ghost Brush Set\nOriginal 8 round Ghost Brushes and 2 Ghost Dry Brushes\nIf you need a set or two of the original Ghost Brushes I have included pledges just for you! I set out to design the Ghost Brush specifically to help people paint miniatures and people love them! The wide range of sizes were chosen to give you the flexibility to paint the tiniest buckle on your favorite character\u2019s shoe to the massive wings of a terrifying dragon! The white nylon hair holds a nice point compared to most synthetic brushes and is soft enough to achieve smooth blends. Finally, the birch wood handle gives you the feel of being an artist right in your hand. I want you to improve as a painter by having access to quality brushes that get the job done and don't break the bank!\nLet's Make The GHOST Dry Brush Size #0D!\n\nThe new Ghost Dry Brush #0D has already been designed, tested, and I can include once we reach $50,000. This goal may sound high but the last campaign was over triple this amount! This brush is small but packs quite a punch! It has has a thinner handle than the #1D and #2D in this range and is exactly what you asked for. A smaller Ghost Dry Brush! When the stretch goal of $50,000 is obliterated all eligible pledges will have this brush included!!!! The only 2 pledges not eligible will be the Classic Pledges.\n#2D, #1D, #0D\nSome minis are worth spilling paint for! But we won't be spilling any today!\nDesigner @polymorph_miniatures used his ungodly skill to help bring my concept for this amazing new add-on to life! The Necro Paint Pot Holder is the most entrancing way to hold your washes and paints during use to prevent accidentally spilling them. This diabolic creation is resin and will look truly wicked on your paint table. This is a perfect project for your new Ghost Dry Brushes and I can't wait to see how you all paint them to display in your hobby area\nNecro Paint Pot Holder\nFun to paint!\nDo you own a game store?\n\nDo you own a commission paint studio?\n\nDo you need a ton of paintbrushes?\nRetailer Display Rack\nThe retail pledge is for you! You will receive 5 GhosTiny Sets and a 100 Ghost Brushes and a display rack to entice customers! The display rack has 96 holes and I will include some signs with the rack! This pledge is also open for everyone who needs a lot of paintbrushes! If you own a retail store and your customers love these brushes I will be able to fulfill orders right away to keep your display rack full! Don't forget the retail pledges also receive stretch goals earned during the campaign!\nCare for your Ghost Brush\nThe Ghost white nylon hair not only looks great but will help you create better painting habits. Always remember to load the brush with paint only about half way to avoid getting paint in your ferrule. Getting paint inside the ferrule is the fastest way to ruin your brush.\n\nClean your brushes frequently with water and use brush soap after painting to make sure no paint residue is left inside the bristles. The white nylon hair will change color from use but it is good practice when cleaning your brushes to try and get them as clean as possible.\nAll paint brushes are designed to pull paint and this one is no different; however, as miniature painters, we tend to use a stabbing motion with our brushes to push paint into small details. This push motion causes the tip of your synthetic brushes to curl over time. To reduce this, use a pulling motion with your brushes as much as possible and if you absolutely need to push paint into a small area, make sure you use very gentle pressure.\nNEVER leave your Ghost Brush or any paintbrush sitting submerged in water! This will not only destroy your wonderful sharp tip, it will cause the wood handle to swell and ruin your whole brush. Seriously, stop dropping your brushes hair-down inside a water cup. Instead, swish the brush back and forth in the water to remove paint, then wipe on a towel to make sure no paint is left within the bristles.\nThese tips will help your new favorite paintbrush enjoy a longer life.\nGhost Brush Family Photo\nGhost Brush Classic Pledge\nIf you missed out on the first two campaigns these pledges are for YOU. These pledges are for the painter who wants the original sets of Ghost brushes but doesn't want the new GhosTiny set. An advantage of this pledge is the brushes are at a great price, ready to be shipped and will be sent out right away!

Indie Boards & Cards will use contract manufacturing to make this game, freight forwarders to get games through customs, and 3rd parties like Amazon, the US Post Office, and FEDEX to ship the games to you \u2013 we don't control everything and there are lots of opportunities for delay.

After that, we have a policy of no questions asked, though that\u2019s minus 20% for Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we can\u2019t get back from them after 14 days). However, if we\u2019ve begun packaging your pledge for shipment (usually 4 to 6 weeks before the actual shipping date), no refunds are possible. If a component cannot be delivered AT ALL, we refund that completely, including fees.\n\nAll refunds after the 14 days close of the campaign may be processed via PayPal or reversed via Stripe to your credit card at our discretion. Refunds within 14 days are reversed via Stripe to your credit card.\nThis project is being funded in USD and any refunds processed will be in USD for the exact amount received in USD, excluding any applicable fees depending on the time of the refund being processed.\n\nDAMAGED OR INCOMPLETE PRODUCTS\n\nWe understand that all backers want to receive their items in pristine condition; however, the realities of worldwide shipping can sometimes make this difficult. We guarantee that the product you receive will be complete and all internal components in perfect condition. We will do our best to ensure that your package arrives in good condition, but all decisions on box replacements will be made on a case-by-case basis. Due to the difficulty and expense of replacing boxes, depending on your region, we will not be able to replace some boxes with minor cosmetic damage only.\n\nRETURNED PRODUCTS\n\nIf you refuse to accept your package on arrival we will not issue you a refund for the cost of the pledge.\n\nFAILURE TO RESPOND TO SURVEY\n\nSurveys will be completed through Crowd Ox. If you fill out the survey after the designated time frame, your package may be delayed in sending to you by up to a few months. If you do not fill out the survey until after the declared end of the project, we may not be able to send it to you.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look, materials, and content of the rewards (and the project) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented while the Kickstarter project was active.\n\nIf you do not log in and submit your project survey results (ie, provide us with your shipping address) for your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received. However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your pledge (at additional cost for international backers) if you complete your project survey after the 8-week window has elapsed.\n\nIf you do not accept these terms, please do not pledge on this project but instead wait for the general release.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 79 or more", "title": "Fractured Lightning", "descp": "You will receive one copy of Aeon's End: Legacy of Gravehold and The Ruins expansion including all unlocked milestones.\nThis pledge is for the new Aeon's End content: a core game, and a small box expansion that includes all unlocked promo cards from this campaign.\nShipping and Taxes are not included and will be charged in the Pledge Manager.

It has experienced delay after delay in development, asset design, pre-production, and production. We are working daily to get this large game completed and out to backers, and ultimately into the marketplace, as soon as possible.\n\nThis project took 0% of the workload away from Sweet Mess. What is needing to be done for Sweet Mess is being done. Montana: Heritage Edition is a complete game and has already been manufactured and released. This means that the factory has the production for this game already and needs nothing else for its production. Goldrush and Longhorns are also complete and has been produced by our partners, White Goblin Games, and their factory files will be shared with us and the factory, making this project a quick turnaround.\n\nWe hope you do not judge this project, White Goblin Games, or Big Kid Games, on the delay of Sweet Mess. It is an untimely delay that we are facing, but be assured that, in the end, a well-designed and well-produced game will be the result.\n\nTerritorial License:\n\nThis is a licensed game from White Goblin Games and Big Kid Games are only able to accept pledges from supporters in the territories of our agreement - US, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. Big Kid Games cannot accept pledges outside of these countries. The Montana game line can be acquired through White Goblin Games and their partners in other regions of the world. Please visit www.whitegoblingames.com and contact them directly for any such questions regarding sales in other regions.\n\nMontana: Goldrush and Montana: Longhorns are completed products that are released in Europe and other regions of the world (Longhorns pending). The expansions are complete and ready to print, with needing only minimal factory preparation and setup. We expect to have these expansions print-ready in short order.\n\nMontana: Heritage Edition is a released game in the territories listed above, with a retail version available in stores now, although quantities are limited. This campaign serves the purpose of reprinting the Kickstarter version of the game, as well as additional retail units, along with the expansions and additional content for the game. Montana: Heritage Edition's initial printing included a small batch error of misprints of punchboard 7. We will take steps with LongPack Games to ensure that misprint chances are minimized, if not eliminated.\n\nFulfillment & Shipping:\n\nBig Kid Games have learned valuable lessons in manufacturing, delays, and expected timelines. We believe that our conservative preparation, printing, and fulfillment timetable for the Montana line is accurate. Of course, it is not impossible for delays to occur from uncontrollable sources and/or circumstances.\n\nQuartermaster Logistics will be fulfilling and shipping your rewards. QML's partners in Canada and Australia will handle the shipping to those regions. The 'Shipping Chart' above depicts estimated costs only. Actual shipping costs, per weight, will be assessed and collected within CrowdOx after the campaign. There is no shipping collected within this Kickstarter campaign.\n\nPledge Management:\n\nWe partner with CrowdOx to collect and manage shipping information, as well as collect any additional funds for add-ons, late pledges, and pre-orders. All information collected is private, protected, and not shared. We will be opening CrowdOx for backer management, adjustments, and orders the week after the campaign ends.\n\nRefund Policy:\n\nAll pledges can be refunded up to the closing of the CrowdOx pledge manager. If the refund is requested more than 60 days after the end of the Kickstarter campaign, 10% will be deducted from the amount refunded. This is corresponding to the charges incurred by Kickstarter and Stripe, since those will not be refunded to us after that point. At that point, the refund will be completed via PayPal instead of the credit card you used through Kickstarter or CrowdOx.\n\nTerms & Conditions:\n\nYou agree that it is your responsibility to submit to us your information for the purposes of shipping your rewards. Your information will be entered into CrowdOx, where it will be confirmed by you before the closing date. Your information will not be used by anyone outside of Big Kid Games and their partners and your information will never be given away or sold.\n\nYou agree that it is Big Kid Games' responsibility to ship to you your rewards as listed out in this Kickstarter campaign and as confirmed by you via the CrowdOx pledge management system.\n\nThank you for your support!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 20 or more", "title": "Retailer Pledge", "descp": "This pledge is for retailers in the US, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand only.\nEligible retailers can order any and all items from this campaign and retailer orders will include all promos, such as Montana: Trade Posts!

Their games are highly sought after and when Alley Cat Games had the opportunity to create a game by Louis & Stefan we jumped at the chance!\nAndrew's artwork brings Tungaru to life and he has become one of the most sought after artists in board games. We loved his art for Everdell and The river and we think you'll agree that his artwork for Tungaru is absolutely stunning!\nNote: The Deluxe Edition will ONLY be printed for this Kickstarter and will not be available through general distribution. After Kickstarter, it will only be available in limited quantities directly from Alley Cat Games at conventions and through the website.\n Exceptional game design - Louis & Stefan Malz have brought together a wonderful combination of gameplay elements: Dice Placement, Engine Building, and an innovative Leader drafting mechanism make this Euro game truly outstanding.\n Stunning artwork - Andrew Bosley brings a special touch to any game featuring his artwork. He's done some truly stunning pieces for Tungaru!\n Multiple strategies to play - Will you focus heavily on resource conversion for early points or will you focus on recruiting Nomads mainly for their end of game scoring bonuses? Maybe a mix of both?\n Outstanding production quality - Back the Kickstarter version and you'll get 40 culture monuments and 5 beautifully crafted boat minis to hold your dice as well as Island tiles that increase variability.\n Dice-Holding Boats! - We've given you dice-holding ambulances, a dice-holding helicopter and now come dice-holding boats!

Players also gather any resources that the Nomads in their community produce.\nEach player plays one Leader card face down and all players reveal simultaneously. The instant actions are then resolved and the cards remain face up in front of the player who played them, ready to be used for their dice placement slots and special abilities.\n Tungaru provides a huge range of possible actions. Place dice on spots on the board or on the Leader cards to gather resources, settle the islands, attract Nomads to your culture, trade with the islanders, or use other asymmetrical actions provided by Nomads.\nA variety of available actions\nGathering resources is key to victory, you'll use them to trade, recruit nomads, settle the islands and even convert them directly to victory points.\nHarvest valuable resources\nNomads will bring new skills to your culture, and unlock new victory conditions, making every game of Tungaru unique \nNomads strengthen your culture\nYou have limited space for Nomads in your community so deciding which abilities to keep can be a tough choice.  \nNomads provide a variety of abilities including resource production, dice manipulation, the ability to convert resources to victory points and other special once-per-game abilities.  \nLeader cards that were played this round are passed clockwise, giving each player a different set of leaders, and a new round begins.  \nWe will be using Pledge Manager after the Kickstarter has ended to manage add-ons and shipping. \nIf you want to add any of the add-ons below to your pledge, please do so in the Pledge Manager\nYou can pledge at the \u00a31 level now to gain access to the pledge manager!\n Please note, we will be using Pledge Manager to manage add-ons so please do not add the funds to your pledge yet.

Prices will severely vary between location (due to shipping and customs) so please message us for rates.\nUnfortunately, we won't be able to offer group pledges for some countries in Asia, so please message us beforehand so we can check.\nWe are subsidising shipping and absorbing some of the cost of each shipment. Costs are shown in the approximate local currency. To double-check the pricing to your region or for more accurate pricing, please go to to the pledge tier and select your country.\nActual shipping charges will be charged in the pledge manager and may be cheaper than the amount stated.\nDue to previous shipping issues, we do not ship to South America, Mexico, Russia, and all of the Middle East (in particular UAE, or Saudi Arabia).\nAn optimistic prediction of the timeline:\n November: KS completes.

Most backers have their copies.\nPLEASE NOTE: If there are any delays it could push this back farther for completing fulfilment. The above is an optimistic prediction.

The campaign allowed us to get a larger 3D printer, and to deliver some great accessories for Scythe by Stonemaier Games.\nNow we're back! By continuing to hone our 3D modeling and printing skills, we designed what we believe to be the best storage solution for Stonemaier Games' newest game, Tapestry. The design for the inside of Tapestry does not allow a lot of room for all the player pieces in the vacuformed wells or above the board. We have worked hard through a lot of trial and error to design a compact, robust, storage solution that fits in these wells.\nOutlines help show where pieces are stored\nEach player gets their own organizer which holds all their buildings, cubes, towers, and resources. The organizers include outlines to help players know where to store pieces as well. A unique design allows these organizers to stack by slide-locking. Three of these organizers plus a lid just fits into each of the two wells.\nA unique design allows these organizers to stack by slide-locking.\nAll 6 organizers stored neatly in the wells\nThree of these organizers plus a lid fits into each of the two wells.\nThe 6th organizer holds all of the Space hex tiles, and conveniently nests with the other organizers. Holes in the bottom allow you to easily push out tiles without damaging the sides.\nColors may vary\nThe lid has a recessed area, making it easy to grip and slide off. The lids also allow for vertical storage without worrying about the pieces falling out.\nIn addition to the Player Organizers and Space Hex Organizer, there is also a Hex Land Tile & Dice holder and Lid. This conveniently holds all the hex Land tiles and one set of dice.\nColors may vary from shown\nAs with the Space Hex Organizer, it also has holes underneath to allow you to easily push out tiles without damaging the sides. An edge is also exposed allowing you to remove tiles that way as well.\nThe Hex Land Tile & Dice holder conveniently sits atop the board, with plenty of room to allow for future expansion.\nWe truly believe that this is the best and most compact storage solution for Tapestry, utilizing the existing storage and maximizing space.\nThis is your chance to get a bespoke product, a beautiful and functional storage solution for Tapestry.\nThis is a simple campaign. Unlike last time, we already have the 3D printer in-house and configured. In addition, we have since acquired a second T-REX 3D printer, doubling our capacity. This campaign is for the Tapestry Storage Solution. Printing and fulfillment can begin as soon as the campaign ends. We have tried to make this easy, so you can get to playing more quickly. \nAdvancement Track Tokens\nAdd-Ons\nWe have a few add-ons available if you are interested. If you would like to upgrade your organizers to translucent colors, please add $5 to your pledge. If you would like to add a set of Advancement Track tokens (shown above), you can add $5 to your pledge to include these.

If you purchased a set of dice for each player and want a dice storage solution, you can add $5 to your pledge to include a second closed 5-hex box to hold 5 sets of dice. Simply click \"Manage your pledge\" to adjust your pledge amount accordingly to add any of these.

The affection for this period is not for the high and mighty, but for the underdog. It's Lizzy Bennet and John Bates, Jane Eyre and Elinor Dashwood, David Copperfield and Mary Thorne.\nSuch rich material deserves to be celebrated!\nRecognition \nObsession has been honored with prestigious nominations and awards acknowledging both immersive theme and intricate strategy.  It has been reviewed and lauded by the major personalities in the tabletop gaming business, including Ant Lab Games, Dice Tower, Heavy Cardboard, JonGetsGames, Rahdo Runs Through, Three Minute Board Games, and 16 more. Obsession (and the Wessex expansion) sold out over 3000 copies in less than a year.\nProject Scope\nThis project expands upon the Obsession experience with a particular focus on the domestic staff. In the Upstairs, Downstairs expansion, four new servants enter play. \nBefore we get to know the Cook, Hall Boy, Head Housemaid, and Useful Man, note that this project will fund the following:\nFirst printing of the Upstairs, Downstairs expansion\nSecond printing of Obsession  \nSecond printing of the Wessex expansion \nThese three titles will be offered at between a 20% and 23% discount off of MSRP (not counting the 43% discount on the Loyalty Bundle), and the pledge levels will feature all possible combinations of these three games.\nImportant Note: Experienced Obsession players are here for the expansion, but others have come to learn more about Obsession. If you're a veteran, scroll down for the expansion content of Upstairs, Downstairs, but if you are unfamiliar with Obsession, here is an excellent video from 3 Minute Board Games to use as a frame of reference:\nKayenta Games Customer Service and Refund Policy\nKayenta Games' refund policy is simple: there will be perfection in your game experience or your money back. In the previous Kickstarter, we encountered issues common to a good-sized fulfillment project and solved them to the 100% satisfaction of our backers. Kayenta Games replaced boxes with slight splits from shipping, any component with an imperfection, even components that a gamer accidentally damaged (spilled wine!), and never one nickel charged.\nAfter production was underway, two errors in player aids were discovered. Kayenta Games immediately committed to reprinting the aids, launched a promotional card project as an apology, and shipped the card packet free to every backer and owner of the game worldwide, an effort that cost over $10,000. \nThe game must be perfect. \n\"My good opinion, once lost, is lost forever.\" \u2014Mr. Darcy (and backers of KS projects)\nObsession embraces the rich stories supplied by Victorian fate: shocking revelations, haunting tragedy, unbearable secrets, family dishonor. Navigating the twists of Victorian fate in Obsession is the story...and the tactical challenge. \nUpstairs, Downstairs is an expansion that supplies gamers with new options for mitigating your fate. But true to the game's spirit, the mechanics are intertwined with the theme\u2014specifically, in the unique abilities of new domestics: the Cook, Hall Boy, Head Housemaid, and Useful Man.\nDRAFT Version of Upstairs, Downstairs Rulebook\nMeet the New Servants\nCook Ability: The cook enables a player to invite guests 1 or 2 levels above the reputation showing on the player board. In the example below, our player (the Howard family, reputation level 3) normally would be unable to receive the Marquess of Tetbury (prestige rating 5) in the Drawing Room; however, her extraordinary cook breaks down the social restraint of the marquess, who cannot resist Mrs. Puggins' larded oysters, which will be on the menu later that evening. \nHall Boy Ability: This young footman-in-training presents the butler with an excellent service option for a demanding guest pressed with personal and political affairs while staying at the estate. \nThe hall boy may be placed onto a gentry card showing a monetary favour to increase the pounds received during the Enjoy Favours phase of a player's turn.\nHead Housemaid Ability: The head housemaid is the household's most well-connected domestic worker, with extensive contacts in and around Derbyshire. Since she is so well-informed, the head housemaid is able to supply critical information to the lady of the house to help ensure only the best people become acquainted with the family.\nThe head housemaid may be placed onto an improvement tile or gentry card showing an invitation favour to allow the player to look at an additional card when inviting guests.\nUseful Man Abilities: The useful man is, well...very  useful, and his abilities require a good understanding of Obsession. If you have familiarity with the base game, these abilities are as follows:\nPlace the Useful Man onto the Private Study tile during a Village Fair round, thereby increasing the revenue from that Village Fair by \u00a3200 (either from \u00a30 to \u00a3200 if the Study Tile has not been flipped or from \u00a3300 to \u00a3500 if the Study Tile has been flipped).\nPlace the Useful Man onto any tile in the builders\u2019 market when making a purchase, thereby decreasing the cost of the tile by \u00a3100.  \nPlace the Useful Man onto any improvement tile located in the player\u2019s organiser (only tiles that can be played on the player\u2019s family board qualify), thereby temporarily decreasing the prestige rating of the tile by one.\n One Time Use: Remove the Useful Man from the game to refresh the builders\u2019 market.\n One Time Use: Remove the Useful Man from the game to allow the player to search the tile bag for a specific tile (monuments excluded) and place it in the \u00a3800 rightmost space of the builders\u2019 market (the tile currently in the \u00a3300 space is returned to the bag, the remaining five tiles slide to the left, and the new tile is placed in the \u00a3800 space, where it can then be purchased normally). \nTeam Cooperative Play (New Video!)\nCompetitive Upstairs, Downstairs Play\n\n5th Player\nThe Upstairs, Downstairs expansion adds all the necessary components to enable five players. \nPlayer Board (with reputation counters/marker): Two-sided player board* with improved Order of Play. One side contains an integral improvement tile organiser (shown below) to enable play without using the separate Country Estate Organiser (if space is at a premium).\n* The Howard family board is not required if the Wessex family board is available\nThe Howard Family\nCountry Estate Organiser and START Tiles\nGuests: The inclusion of 33 new guests (16 prestige and 17 casual) expands the supply  for five players and balances the guest mix as follows: \nThere is an emphasis on guests of prestige rating 2 to de-emphasize unsavory guests, which have a high concentration in the original Obsession casual deck\nThere is an emphasis on guests of prestige rating 3 to increase the utility of early prestige guest draws (and support the Expert Variant guest display)\nSeven new starter guests are added  to increase variety (and support the Expert Variant guest display)\nThere are no guests of prestige rating 6 in the 33 new cards, which thematically increases the rarity of these special guests\nThere is an increase in the frequency of monetary favours as pounds can be critically tight early in a game\nPrestige Guests (sixteen)\nCasual Guests (seventeen)\nServants' Hall Rule Change (new tile): The original Servants' Hall is overpowered\u2014particularly in a 2 player game\u2014and needs correction. With the release of the Upstairs, Downstairs expansion, this is addressed as part of a formal rule change for this tile. \nNew Rule: In order to spread gossip and \"steal\" reputation from an opponent, an available servant must be placed onto the Servants' Hall tile in the player's organiser. Any available servant\u2014including the butler and housekeeper and the new servants from the Upstairs, Downstairs expansion\u2014may be the source of the gossip and rumours, but the servant used must be expended and rotated normally back to available service.\nAny servant can be a source of damaging rumours\nUpstairs, Downstairs also comes with additional player aids; you are ready to play Obsession with five players!\nModified Extended Play Round Track & Tableau Round Track\nThe Upstairs, Downstairs expansion comes with a two-sided round track. On the front side is the modified extended play track that relocates the National Holiday to make it more relevant.\nOn the reverse side, Upstairs, Downstairs comes with two completely new modes of play supported by a single round track that removes courtship and places the focus on building your country estate. The ruleset for the competitive game called Tableau Obsession is currently being edited and will be posted before the project concludes. For more detail on the solo mode\u2014Solo Estate Challenge\u2014visit the Solitaire Spot at the bottom of the page.\n\nNEW! A playthrough of Tableau Obsession.\nOfficial Variant Rulebook\nAn official rulebook that collects into one place the approved and playtested variants will be included with Upstairs, Downstairs. Rules for the Expert Variant, Dynamic Cooperative Mode, and other designer and user-developed content will be in one location, some with additional components (in the game box) and dedicated player aids.\nStretch Goals\nSee Update #17 for details on the Box Storage System!\n\nRevenue stretch goals, 8 of 10 achieved!\n\n\n\n\nAnd now for a 51 second video interlude: \n A new video from 3MBG, with a GREAT finish:\nLearning Obsession\nYou are the head of a respected but troubled family estate in mid-19th century Victorian England. After several lean decades, family fortunes are looking up! Your goal is to improve your estate so as to be in better standing with the truly influential families in Derbyshire.\nObsession Rulebook\nObsession Glossary\nObsession is a game in which players build a deck of Victorian gentry (British social upper class), renovate their estate by acquiring building tiles from a centralized builders' market, and manipulate an extensive service staff comprised of butlers, housekeepers, underbutlers, maids, valets, and footmen to support elaborate social gatherings. \nEach turn, players choose a building tile representing a renovated room or outdoor space in and around their 19th century British country house. The tile chosen dictates the event that can be hosted and the guests to be invited, and players must carefully plan to have the proper staff available to service the event and support guests as needed. The reward for success is new investment opportunities permitting further renovation of the estate, an increase in reputation in the county, an expanding circle of influential acquaintances, and a larger and highly-trained domestic staff.\nThroughout the game, a competitive courtship for the hand of the most eligible young gentleman and lady in the county presents specific renovation and reputation objectives. The player who best meets these objectives may win the hand of the love interest and the game.\nAn Example of the Obsession Player Tableau\nFor extraordinary detail on Obsession gameplay, the following videos do a superb job teaching and demonstrating the game:\nLarge Consolidated Player Aid\nDeveloped by Peter Lazzaro, provided as a downloadable PDF.\nNew Features in the Second Printing\nThere are several new features in the second printing of Obsession:\nTile Numbering System\nThe builders' market is populated with improvement tiles according to their rank. The sorting system in the first edition of Obsession proved non-intuitive and made setup, as well as in-game refreshing of the market, a daunting task. The 2nd printing of Obsession introduces a numbering system that eliminates the needs to memorize or look up the tile rankings.\nEach tile now has a small number in the lower right quadrant. Tiles drawn for initial population or a market refresh are then placed in numerical order. Consider these six tiles drawn randomly from the tile bag during a market refresh; normally, the rank of these tiles (two service, two prestige rating 3, two prestige rating 5) would have to be looked up in the Glossary. \n? ? ? ? ?\nWith the new tile numbering system, simply sort the tiles by the small number (circled in yellow) and place them into the builders' market in ascending order.\nPlayer Board Upgrades: The player boards (family boards) have received a facelift. The Order of Play has been expanded to include a check of pre-turn events/actions, and the boards are now two-sided, one which has an intregral country estate organiser (pictured below).\nModified Extended Play Round Track: The Extended Play side of the original Round Track had the National Holiday located on round 17, which is not an ideal location.  The Extended Play side will now feature the National Holiday on round 11, which greatly improves the flow of play.\nAdditional Enhancements to the game include:\nFour Objective Cards have been balanced and one card removed and replaced.\nThe value 6, 7, 8 Victory Point Cards have been eliminated; all VP values are 3, 4, and 5 and the frequency of certain cards adjusted.\nThe Box has been increased to be 76mm deep (up from 68mm deep) which will make it possible to store all expansions in the main box, if desired. The white cardboard box insert will be eliminated (there will be a stretch goal for an alternative storage system).\nWessex Content\nWessex Family Player Board: The Wessex expansion adds a fifth, two-sided player board with the updated Order of Play. The Wessex family advantage is that they have the largest estate and begin the game with either the Breakfast Room or the Tennis Court in their organiser.\nThe Wessex Family\nThe Wessex Family Advantage Tiles: Note that in the original printing of the Wessex expansion, the two tiles below\u2014provided specifically for the Wessex family advantage\u2014were placed in the main Obsession box due to an issue with the die cut. This has been corrected. These two tiles will now come in the Wessex expansion box with the player board.\nTile sorting numbers provided in case these tiles get mixed into the general supply\nSecond Printing Bonus Tiles\nThe creation of a diecut to move the two Wessex family advantage tiles to the Wessex expansion box affords the opportunity to add bonus tiles! All 2nd printing copies of the Wessex expansion will contain the Morning Room and Retiring Room tiles:\nFront and Back (with the rose) of the Morning Room Tile\n\nThe Morning Room introduces a variable invitation tile as well as the first ESSENTIALS tile with a prestige rating of 1. The Morning Room was a sitting room in a great house situated to receive the morning sun; this room was a favorite location early in the day to review menus and plan the day's activities.\nFront and Back (with the rose) of the Retiring Room Tile\n\nThe Retiring Room's single female invite can extend a deck, supply critical reputation early, and provide powerful flexibility in the first two seasons. The 'Retiring' Room was a temporary designation for an existing room set aside for visiting ladies to repair damage to dresses and appearances generally (a maid would be on hand to facilitate these repairs).  This introduces the first tile where a lady's maid is the essential activity servant.\n\nPrestige Guests (five)\nCasual Guests (eleven)\nSolitaire Cards (for extended solo play): The base game of Obsession comes with twelve solitaire opponents, four at each level of difficulty. Those twelve opponents are for a standard length game (12 turns).  The Wessex expansion brings six new solitaire opponents (two at each difficulty level) for extended play competition (16 turns).\nHello! Dan Hallagan here; I am going to speak to my fellow solo players directly. Forgive my alteration of the Anthony Trollope quote immediately above (I changed 'book' to 'board game'), but what could be more civil than settling in for a solo game on a wintry afternoon? I am sure Mr. Trollope would agree.\nI have a special place in my heart for solo play. I play every game I own solo (sometimes 2-player solitaire if there is no solo mode), because there is no better way to learn a game before going on to teach it to others. When teaching (and I am always the one who teaches), I am pulled in many directions; the feel and play of the game takes a back seat. Solo is when I enjoy the luxuriousness of high-end board games and appreciate the designer's attention to detail.\nBoth the base game of Obsession (standard play) and the Wessex expansion (extended play) have solo opponents in the form of cards that provide a specific tactical challenge during gameplay. \nObsession solitaire win the 1 Player Guild  fan vote for2018 Solitaire Game of the Year, was nominated by Every Night is Game Night (ENGN) for Best Solo Strategy Game of 2018, and debuted in People's Choice Top Solo Games at 156.\nIn addition, a dynamic opponent has been created that employs a clever and powerful AI for a unique challenge.  This ruleset is being formalized in an official game mode and variant rulebook that will be published online as well as printed for the Upstairs, Downstairs expansion.\nFor those new to Obsession, I am going to let Liz Davidson from Beyond Solitaire teach today. Then I am going to show you a special solo creation that is part of the Upstairs, Downstairs expansion!\nUpstairs, Downstairs introduces a new solitaire game: Solo Estate Challenge. Here, the focus shifts from courtship to tableau-building; the solo player is in total control with all options open to them, but can she finish in time and craft the right tableau to win? \n A complete playthrough of Solo Estate Challenge in two videos (apologies for some technical difficulties):\nPART 1\nPART 2\nDiary Archive \nArchive\nSeptember 19: Cook, Hall Boy, Head Housemaid player aid.\nSeptember 20: Useful Man player aid.\nSeptember 21: (no post)\nSeptember 22: Meet Feifrau von Ludwigstorff.\nSeptember 23: Meet Sir Wallace Carter, Bt.\nSeptember 24: Meet Glencora and Plantagenet Palliser.\nSeptember 25: Meet Dr. Richard Clarkson.\nSeptember 26: A new non-revenue Stretch Goal!

It is now time for some of those ideas to become a reality in this second expansion. More control over the game, more variety in detectives and criminals, more choices, more, more, more!\nTwo new detectives and two new inspectors are joining the team:\n- Brick Larson is a former boxer and rehabilitated second story man. He can reduce time by 3 hours to gain 1 permanent twist marker!\n- Sarah Dayley has special abilities in the Storyline...\nCaptain Harrington and Olga Domino have been included as well as the two new inspectors.\nThe expansion comes with 2 new cases to solve each of which features nice twists and turns!\nThe Society of Corpses: Six all new dastardly criminals! The Chairwoman, Mr. Holiday, Ronnie The Chin, \"Leering\" Jack Callahan, The Obscurant and Lady Ace will trouble your nights during the many sessions of Pulp Detective yet to come...\nPublishing a new expansion means that we have a great excuse to produce a new die, and Todd has obliged us by designing the Girl Friday die! \n6 New Henchmen can be encountered during the game. Each one will give you a special ability! \n6 Gun Molls will cross the paths of your detectives and inspectors, potentially giving you a permanent ability or clues. \nBut be careful to not fall in one of the 6 new traps in the expansion!\n  For more details on the components and rules of Pulp Detective click HERE\nWe are also taking advantage of the second expansion release to solve the minor issue of the mixed color cubes. Todd has designed something great with the yellow and black cubes, which were inside the base game boxes, and we will add the blue and red cubes to the expansion box, which were missing last year.  \nDownload the draft of the English rules HERE\nT\u00e9l\u00e9charger la version Fran\u00e7aise des r\u00e8gles ICI \n\n Add $8 to your pledge to get an additional set of all 8 dice (6 from the base game, and 1 from each expansion)\nWe'd love for you to try Pulp Detective before you back the campaign!

Illustrated with over 1,000 pieces of unique, stylish art, it will take you on a fantastic adventure set in a dark reimagination of the Arthurian legends.\n Designed by Krzysztof Piskorski (one of the most well-known Polish fantasy writers) and Marcin \u015awierkot (owner of Awaken Realms, developer of Lords of Hellas, Nemesis, The Edge: Dawnfall), Tainted Grail will bring you adventure, survival and exploration mechanics perfectly paired with character development and exciting combat and diplomatic systems.\nImmersive, story-driven exploration will bring the world of Avalon to life, confronting you and your team with difficult choices that have far-reaching consequences. Over 100,000 words of branching story scripts provide many different paths to your goal as well as several different endings to your adventures!\nClick!\n                                                                    click!\n                           click!\n                               click\n                                                   \"The Tainted Grail is easily my most anticipated solo / co-op Kickstarter of the year!

After you survive it once, there are still lots of new things to see, and storylines to experience!\nAnd even if you make the same choices on your new playthrough, random Events, Encounters and randomized elements within the Journal ensure no two games play alike, while tense, survival-based gameplay lends itself to many unique moments of emergent storytelling.\nYour characters are not run-of-the-mill \u201cheroes\u201d. They are flawed outcasts, called upon after the true champions of the land failed or fell. Each has unique flavor, a powerful ability, one big drawback that you need to play around, and two decks of individual Combat and Diplomacy upgrade cards.\nRegardless of whether you play alone or in a group of four, the game scales up to provide an adequate challenge. What\u2019s more, you may add or remove players after each Chapter, modifying the group size as you go!\nYou will journey through a grim land based on Arthurian legends and Celtic mythology, exploring its daunting secrets. Your decisions will shape both your adventure and the game world around you, as each campaign is set apart by many years, revealing the long-term consequences of your actions. A deep, branching storyline allows you to tackle problems in different ways, ensuring no two games play alike.\nIn a land slowly sinking into the Wyrdness and torn apart by conflict, surviving each day is a challenge on its own. In addition, Guardian Menhirs, that ensure safe travel throughout the realm, are slowly going dark, turning a simple map into an engaging puzzle.\nTo overcome these challenges, your character develops along several conflicting attributes such as Aggression / Empathy or Practicality / Spirituality. These traits unlock a rich choice of skills and lead to different deck-building strategies, making character advancement meaningful and deep.\nThe character you develop is going to be tested during dozens of combat and non-combat encounters. Sometimes you will need brute force, but often diplomacy might be a better option. Regardless whether you fight with your strength or your wits, our unique dice-less encounter system makes resolving each conflict fun and exciting.\nTainted Grail will force you to make hard choices with consequences that might present themselves even several decades later, in a future campaign, changing the environment and the balance of powers on the island. This will make your every playthrough unique and will give you unmatched power to reshape both the world and your story.\nIn Avalon, there\u2019s a legend waiting behind every stone and every tree. All locations have their own rich stories and secrets to discover. Places and characters are often much more than they seem. As you slowly put all the pieces of the larger puzzle together, this land will always have a surprise waiting for you just around the corner.\nCreated by one of the best polish fantasy authors, Krzysztof Piskorski, the story of Tainted Grail: The Fall of Avalon aims to push the boundaries of non-linear narrative, building upon the rich experience Awaken Realms has in fusing ambitious stories with excellent board game mechanics and striking visuals.\nAt Awaken Realms, we have a quite an experience in making and delivering big games. So far, we have created four ambitious titles that expand the standard scope of a board game - all were critically praised and provided a lot of unique experiences to players all over the world.  \nWe also gathered vast practical knowledge about deep integration of various themes, and we've learned how to build interactive, branching stories that seamlessly connect with gameplay. We are responsible for the following big titles: This War of Mine: The Board Game, The Edge: Dawnfall, Lords of Hellas, Nemesis.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have currently successfully founded seven Kickstarter projects.

The only risk factor, which can always happen, is a delay in delivery due to unforeseen circumstances. \n\nPlease note that this is not a pre-order and the final product might slightly change in the process or get delayed. We are fully devoted to creating an amazing experience and you can trust us that every choice we make will only be aimed at improving the standard of the final product.\n\nGame and all components will be produced in China and will be up to the highest quality standards that we hold for our previous games.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a315 or more", "title": "Digital Tainted Grail (PC)", "descp": "One Steam Code for Digital edition of Tainted Grail for PC, including early access to the game.\nIMPORTANT: It is already included in all other pledge tiers with Core Box for free!\nThis reward does not include shipping.\nINCLUDES:\nTainted Grail digital (PC) early access and steam code", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Aug 2019"}], "stat": ["380 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a370 or more", "title": "Core Box", "descp": "Tainted Grail: The Fall of Avalon Core Box including all unlock Stretch Goals.\nThis pledge does not include shipping.

Continue below to learn about player powers, libraries, powerful component powers, and game-changing artifacts! \nAfter a limited print run in 2012, Atlantis Rising, like its namesake, virtually disappeared into legend.  We (Elf Creek) managed to get our hands on a copy and immediately understood what Zee and Sam at the Dice Tower loved about this game.  Gripping, tense, thrilling, truly cooperative.  We fell in love.  It's been a joy to work alongside designer Galen Ciscell to bring this game back, with the same core gameplay and new revised features that make it better than ever.  And with the gorgeous artistic work of Vincent Dutrait, it's been a dream come true.  But you don't have to take our word for it. \nAtlantis Rising: Second Edition preserves everything that was cherished and loved from the original edition. The feeling of dread and tension, that rises like the tides along the island shores, the mix of calculation and risk needed to succeed, the stories that the game creates with each play\u2014it's all still here. And it's been improved upon:\nMore strategic choices created by redesigning additional worker recruitment in the Cities and the Wrath of the Gods round tracker (replacing the original's Atlantean Navy)\nNew asymmetric variable player powers that have quickly become a favorite of the new edition's playtesters, that help you feel like your character is in the world helping to save Atlantis!\nAs the floodwaters rise, the tension builds, and hope begins to falter, players now also feel a sense of progression, at their own increasing capacity to stem the tide. New library artifact cards grant players ongoing abilities and the cosmic gate components feature powers that are now reusable.\nFor the first time, a dedicated solo mode and simple ruleset variants to help the two and three player games play with the same excitement and tension as larger player counts.\n But, as with the original edition, you don't have to take our word for it. \nGames will ship in bulk to fulfillment centers around the world to keep customs fees & VAT as low as we feasibly can. Rewards shipped to backers in the US, EU, Canada, Australia, and China will be shipped to backers from within those regions. The amount under \"You Pay\" is what will be added to your pledge when you select your reward (we have already included a base amount for shipping to our pledge levels). Backers from Thailand and Indonesia: Your shipping costs should be $16. We made a mistake when creating the rewards and Kickstarter is adding $26 to your pledge. We sincerely apologize for this. Please check the FAQ for instructions on how to proceed with your pledge.\n  Any questions?  Just ask us, either in the comments or by message. \nThe Champaign-Urbana Community: Our local board gaming community is an amazing source of support, advice, and encouragement.  Whether it\u2019s a casual board game night or an intense playtesting session, we love playing games with y\u2019all.  We cannot thank you all enough for your playtesting, feedback, advise, and friendship.  Curious parties can learn more about our community at www.cudoplays.com and facebook.com/cuboardgames \nWe Make Games: We loved working with Bryce Walter of We Make Games on the End of the Trail project video and were excited to work with him again on Atlantis Rising.  He\u2019s a wonderful person and talented creator and we cannot wait to see what\u2019s next for him in the greater board game community.\nCoalition Game Studios: We want our games to be the very best that they can be.  As with End of the Trail, we partnered with Coalition Game Studios for blind playtesting and we cannot recommend Mike and his team enough for their feedback and hard work with Atlantis Rising. \nMatt Paquette: We first met Matt at Gen Con 2018 and we are blessed to have him working on the Kickstarter page as a creative director.  Matt has worked with AEG, Floodgate Games, Brotherwise Games and others in the board game community and we greatly appreciate his insights and guidance with our campaign.\nPhilip Glofcheskie: Philip has spent over 20 years in the art and game community and recently ran a successful Kickstarter for Wunderkammer. We are thrilled with the work that Philip has done on our Kickstarter page and can\u2019t wait to see the work he will be doing in the future.\nJoseph McDaid: We want to thank Joseph for all the hard work during the past week in assisting with our Kickstarter. Joe has been working alongside Matt with creating the animated gifs for the page. He has also worked with Roxley Games on their Kickstarter projects. \nProtospiel: We are blessed to have been able to playtest with the designers and playtesters that are part of the Protospiel community this year and the game improved due to their valuable early feedback at Protospiel Minnesota and Protospiel Milwaukee. We wish all the designers and publishers that are part of that community well. \nStonemaier Games Design Day: Speaking of early feedback, one of the first places where Atlantis Rising: Second Edition was playtested at was the 2017 Stonemaier Games Design Day. We want to thank the Design Day community for their feedback and Jamey Stegmaier and Alan Stone for hosting such a tremendous event.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAtlantis Rising is Elf Creek Games's second Kickstarter project. We fulfilled our first game, End of the Trail, on time, getting it to backers ahead of its public release at the Origins Game Fair this past June. We are working with the same game manufacturer (Panda GM), where many of the non-printed components are already in production for this project. Any concerns that came up during the manufacturing of End of the Trail were addressed quickly and taken care of in a very timely and professional manner. This is one of the reasons why we are proud to partner with Panda moving forward.\n\nWe are continuing to partner with Quartermaster Logistics for fulfillment in the US and parts of Asia, with Aetherworks for fulfillment in Australia and New Zealand and with Gamesquest for the UK and elsewhere. We also have decided to add Happy Shops as another European fulfilment partner as well as Snakes and Lattes as a partner for Canada. Partnering with these companies will allow us to have shipping and fulfillment costs that are great for our customers and they will work with us to make sure that the fulfillment process with Atlantis Rising: Second Edition goes as smooth as possible.\n\nAs Kickstarter enthusiasts ourselves, we understand that sometimes it is necessary to cancel a pledge, even after it has been collected. Hardships occur to everyone and we want to be a company that understands the issues that backers might face. To this end, we will offer 100% refunds within 90 days of the campaign ending. We will offer a 100% refund within 60 days of receiving your reward.\n\nLastly, we are anticipating for Atlantis Rising: Second Edition to be a larger campaign than our first campaign, End of the Trail. Every campaign brings with it new challenges and learning experiences. We have the utmost confidence in the experience and expertise of our partners to help us along our way. And we have worked to establish relationships with publishers throughout the industry who are always willing to offer us their advice and support. We will be keeping you, our backers, up to date each step along the way. After the campaign, we will be reaching out to you at least once a month and will be available to answer any questions that you have in a timely manner.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 59 or more", "title": "Atlantis Rising - Standard Edition", "descp": "A copy of Atlantis Rising, including relevant stretch rewards.\nINCLUDES:\nAtlantis Rising - Standard Edition", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Aug 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["149 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 69 or more", "title": "Atlantis Rising - Deluxe Edition", "descp": "A copy of the deluxe version of Atlantis Rising, including all relevant deluxe stretch goals.\nINCLUDES:\nAtlantis Rising - Deluxe Edition", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Aug 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["2,057 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 100 or more", "title": "Retailer Pledge (see below)", "descp": "This pledge level is for BRICK & MORTAR stores in the US, CA, EU, AUS, and NZ (and only them), for up to 10 copies of Atlantis Rising.

We are excited to be working with designer Kevin Riley from Action Phase Games, as well as Indie Boards and Cards to bring Aeon\u2019s End to Steam, with your help!\nAeon\u2019s End is right at home at Handelabra Games. The combination of deep strategy and cooperative gameplay will feel familiar to fans of our other games like Sentinels of the Multiverse and One Deck Dungeon. Like other deck-building games, you begin a game of Aeon\u2019s End with a basic deck and gradually improve it with new cards as you play. Aeon's End distinguishes itself by adding several innovative mechanics. Randomized turn order simulates the chaos of battle, and deck management rules invite careful planning of every discarded card.\nThe Project:\nWe are adapting Aeon\u2019s End into a digital tabletop game you can play on your Windows, macOS or Linux PC via Steam. As with our previous projects, we are working in Unity.  \nThe digital version of Aeon\u2019s End will cost $19.99 (USD), but backers can get the game for just $15. The 1.0 retail launch on Steam will include all Aeon's End base game content and features:\n8 playable mages, each with a unique starting card\n4 nemeses to defeat, each with their own mechanics\n27 unique player cards (gems, spells, & relics)\n22 general nemesis cards\n53 nemesis-specific cards\nLocal co-op play with 1-4 mages\nInteractive tutorial so you can learn the game while you play\nBrand-new music composed by Jean-Marc Giffin\nSteam Achievements\nSteam Cloud Saves\nAll unlocked promo cards and mages from stretch goals\nThe Kickstarter Edition delivered to backers at the $20 level or greater will also include the following:\nFree digital download of the Original Soundtrack ($5 value)\n Kickstarter Exclusive Digital Player Card Sleeves and Playmat - Alternate in-game background and card backs that show your support. More info here.\nAeon's End is already a huge success on the tabletop. It was Kickstarted in 2016, with standalone expansion War Eternal, and a new Legacy version in 2017 and 2018.  \nAlready familiar with Aeon's End? Visit this link to try the 5-minute demo now! Or read on for a preview of gameplay.\nAeon's End is a deck-building game. That means you start with a basic deck and gradually add cards to that deck as you gain new relics, gems, and spells to play.\nDuring the main phase, players typically begin by playing gems to gain aether. \nAether is the currency of Aeon's End that allows you to gain cards from the supply.\nAdd gems, spells, and relics to your hand to build your deck. \nYour goal is to defeat the nemesis while protecting the city of Gravehold. You damage the nemesis by using your spells. Spells must first be prepped to opened or focused breaches. Then, you can cast these spells on subsequent turns to deal damage.\nOne innovation in Aeon's End is variable turn order. After each round, the order of turns is shuffled, keeping you on your toes and echoing the chaos of battle.\nAnother innovation of Aeon's End is in deck management. Since you never shuffle your cards, you can carefully manage your deck by planning the order in which you discard your cards.\nOn the nemesis turns, watch out! The Nameless have many ways to turn the tide of battle, including dealing damage to your mages, attacking Gravehold itself, discarding your cards and more. \nIf your mages become exhausted by reaching 0 life, or if Gravehold is destroyed, you have lost. \nTo win, you must either reduce the nemesis to 0 life, or survive the entire nemesis deck and eliminate any remaining minions or powers in play.\nThanks to a new service called SIMMER, we can offer you a short demo of Aeon's End in your browser right now! This is a 5-10 minute experience aimed at giving you a feel for how the game will look and play in a general way. This is a pre-alpha build of the game and covers the first few rounds of a 2-mage game vs the Rageborne nemesis.\nYou can try the demo embedded below, but we recommend you click here to play the demo on SIMMER. Click the full-screen button below the lower right-hand corner of the game for the best experience. The demo works best on an up-to-date desktop browser that supports WebGL such as Chrome, Firefox, or Safari. Enable hardware acceleration in the options for best results. \nSIMMER is a great tool for developers to host builds of their Unity games for others to try out and play. Visit SIMMER.io for more info.\nYou can also check out a playthrough of the tabletop game here.\nDevelopment Streaming Schedule:\nWant to see how the game gets made? We\u2019ll be doing live development streams every Wednesday at 1 PM Eastern on our Twitch channel during the campaign to give you a peek behind the curtain. If you can't watch live, don't worry - we always post our stream to our YouTube channel afterwards. See below for the schedule of topics we will be covering each week:\n Wednesday November 7th: Spell-crafting - See how we implement a spell in the engine, hook it up in the UI, and create a damage effect animation! (Watch it here.)\n Wednesday November 14th: Making a Mage  - Watch us bring a mage to life by implementing their ability and starter card in the engine and UI. (Watch it here.)\n Wednesday November 21st: Tier 2 Arrives - Join John with special guest designer Kevin Riley to chat Aeon's End digital and see John bring tier 2 cards to the demo. (Watch it here.)\n Wednesday November 28th: Nameless Nemesis - Join David as he begins implementation of the Nemesis Carapace Queen.\nAeon\u2019s End will be delivered to backers as a Steam Key, redeemable on the Steam Service for 1 copy of the game. All Kickstarter backers will receive their Steam Key when the game first becomes available in Steam Early Access. All rewards will be delivered via BackerKit, a great service that streamlines the process of post-campaign surveys and fulfillment.   \nWe are planning to ship Aeon\u2019s End to Steam in the first half of 2019.\nWhat is Steam Early Access? \nEarly Access allows people to play games during their development and give feedback to the developers. We plan to bring Aeon\u2019s End to Steam Early Access several months before the game releases to retail.\nAll backers who choose a reward level that includes a copy of the game will be able to participate in Early Access if they choose.\nSame price as retail, but includes a copy of the Soundtrack + Kickstarter Exclusives!\n* What does it mean to become a member of the beta team?\nBecoming a beta team member means you will get access to the private beta of the game via Steam ahead of any retail or Early Access launch. You will play the game to help us discover bugs, report them, and help us make sure the game is as good as it can possibly be. \n* What does it mean to be a member of the alpha team?\nBecoming an alpha team member means you will get access to our alpha testing interface. This is a text-based, rules-only implementation of the game, used to test mechanics. You will play the game to help us discover bugs, report them, and help us make sure the game is as good as it can possibly be. The alpha testing interface will become available to backers shortly after the Kickstarter closes.\nMembers of the alpha and beta teams will be instrumental in helping shape how the new, digital-exclusive promos and mages will play! All content is tested first by the alpha team, then by the beta team before being released to the public.\nWe\u2019ve secured 2/3 of the development budget for the base game already, but we need your help to get version 1.0 completed and shipped in the first half of 2019. \nBut fully funding isn\u2019t the end of the story. The other reason we are using Kickstarter for this project is content. The base game provides countless hours of replayability with its 8 mages and 4 nemeses, but there\u2019s plenty more where that came from!\nAeon\u2019s End has lots of existing promo and bonus cards that we hope to bring to the digital game. We\u2019re also working directly with designer Kevin Riley and our other partners to craft brand-new exclusive content for the digital game. Kevin is taking full advantage of the digital medium to make new content that would be tricky (or impossible) in physical form.\nAnd finally, expansions. The world of Aeon\u2019s End has grown tremendously through expansions like The Depths, The Nameless, The Void, and The Outer Dark as well as the full-sized expansion War Eternal. Through stretch goals, we hope to secure enough funding to bring all that content to the digital game as quickly as possible.\nAs we mentioned above, we will be using BackerKit as our pledge manager for this campaign, which will help us manage add ons. Available add ons:\n $5 - One copy of the Original Soundtrack\n $15 - One additional Steam Key for the game\n $20 - One additional Steam Key for the Kickstarter Edition.\nUnfortunately, the higher levels cannot be added on, as they are limited. If you know someone who would like to become a member of the Alpha or Beta teams, you should have them back the campaign themselves.\n Promo-Packs include 1 Player card and 1 Nemesis card. Some cards are existing promos, while some will be brand new!\n Into the Breach: In her search for the domain of the Nameless, Mist has opened a breach to a strange world known as Mynerva, but someone has returned in her place!\n Xae from One Deck Dungeon joins Aeon's End as a new, digital-exclusive, playable mage, designed for digital Aeon\u2019s End by Kevin Riley. (More info in this update.)\nAlthough she longs to return to Gravehold, for now, Mist joins the heroes of One Deck Dungeon as they battle in Mynerva! Mist for One Deck Dungeon is being designed by Chris Cieslik of Asmadi Games and will be a FREE addition to the game!\n First Expansion: The Nameless will be added to the development schedule! This expansion adds 2 nemeses and 1 breach mage to the game, as well as new gems, relics, spells, and minions. You will be able to add to your pledge to receive this expansion. \n OblivAeon's End: After tapping into the power of the Void, NightMist found herself pulled in and trapped for what felt like eons. So, when she felt a weakness in the fabric of the Void, she lept for it, tearing her way into a new reality and leaving what she knew behind. Now, the Void-powered creature who was once Faye Diamond has materialized in a new place called \u201cGravehold\u201d. (More info in this update.)\n NightMist from Sentinels of the Multiverse joins Aeon's End as a new digital exclusive playable Mage, designed for digital Aeon\u2019s End by Kevin Riley.\n Second Expansion: The Depths expansion will be added to the development schedule. This expansion adds 1 nemesis and 3 breach mages to the game, as well as new spells, relics, gems, and minions. You will be able to add to your pledge to receive this expansion. \nCheck back for more stretch goals as the campaign continues!\nShow your Aeon's End spirit with custom avatars! Check them out here.\nThis is just a sample, more at the link!\nHelp us spread the word on social media to unlock Bonus Packs! Each bonus pack will contain:\n1 new digital player card sleeve\n1 new digital nemesis card sleeve\n1 new digital playmat\nThese items are alternate card backs and backgrounds that let you customize your Aeon's End experience.\nShares, retweets, likes, new follows and subscribes, we'll be tracking them all through the campaign!

Hunt", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "\ud83d\udc4b\ud83c\udffc I\u2019m David Malki !, the author of the comic strip Wondermark. \n\ud83d\udd8b\ufe0f Since 2003, I\u2019ve been taking woodcuts & engravings created by LONG-DEAD ARTISANS and reassembling them into contemporary comic strips, such as this:\n\u2702\ufe0f In other words, I scan illustrations from Victorian-era books & magazines, then take them apart in Photoshop and turn them into comics! Here\u2019s an example of HOW it gets done:\n\ud83d\uddde\ufe0f You may have seen Wondermark comics in newspapers (such as the print edition of The Onion); or printed out and taped to your professor\u2019s door; or \u2013 who am I kidding? \u2013 online. If you\u2019ve seen it, you\u2019ve probably seen it online.\nThis campaign is for a new hardcover collection of comic strips! \nIt\u2019ll look more or less like this! With plenty of MORE INTERESTING PAGES too.\n\ud83c\udfc6 It will be the latest volume in a book series that has garnered reviews such as these:\nThe new book joins this very handsome family.\n\ud83d\udcd6 The new volume will collect Wondermark comics starting with #556, up through at least #740 (the exact length of the book will depend on project funding; see \"Stretch Goals\", below). \n\ud83d\udcda SO, if you have previous volumes of Wondermark in print, this book will pick up right where the last one (Emperor of the Food Chain) left off!\n\ud83c\udfc1 If you don\u2019t have any Wondermark books yet, you\u2019re in luck: this is a great place to start. This was a very good run of strips (IN MY OPINION), and contains some CLASSIC EPISODES as well as some of my absolute favorites:\nobviously in the book you will get the whole comics instead of just a couple panels\n\ud83d\udc18 NOTE: Since, with the book collections, I am progressing through the archive in order, I\u2019m sorry to say that this book will contain no sea lions and no sick elephants. Those strips will have a home in future books! And if this campaign does well, it\u2019s all the more likely that we\u2019ll get to those books before too long.\n\ud83c\udfed ALSO NOTE: The expected delivery date for this book is in the spring of 2019. I will be working on finishing the interiors of the book throughout the fall of 2018, and then the completed books will take a few months to cross the ocean from Asia. \n\ud83d\uddd3\ufe0f My plan is to send the book safely off to print, and then shift gears to work on the 2019 Wondermark Calendar (an annual tradition). So please note that the calendar, a separate project, will go on sale in November/December, and then print and ship before these books arrive \u2013 this is expected, and is just because those are printed locally, while the books will be printed overseas. If you order a book now and then a calendar in December, you\u2019ll get the calendar first, and then the book in the spring. Just so there are no surprises!  \n\ud83c\udfa8 As I always like to do in my books, a generous number of the strips have been NEWLY COLORED, and are being shown in color here on this very webpage for the first time ever!\n\ud83c\udf81 All my Wondermark books are chock-full of extra goodies you can\u2019t find online, and this one will be no exception.\n\ud83d\udc8e In addition to the comic strips themselves, look forward to enjoying:\nAn application to give your mischievous child to the circus\nA table of foods matched up with the appropriate atypical utensil to use\nA waiver of liability for the use of a cryogenic hibernation chamber\nA text transcript between a pair of naughty Cold War re\u00ebnactors\nA list of impressive epitaphs for your own personal use\nAnd many more peculiar things!\n\ud83e\udd47 Format-wise, this book will match my previous volumes: a cloth-bound hardcover, with gold foil stamping on the cover and spine. \nNot to put too fine a point on it, but it will DEFINITELY MAKE YOUR OTHER BOOKS JEALOUS.\n\ud83c\udf2e Right now, the plan is to make only a hardcover edition of the new book. I know some of the older books are only available (at present) in paperback, so a FULLY MATCHING SET is unfortunately not something science can achieve without seeking out used copies of the previous volumes (which, by the way, you are free to do on eBay or Alibris or Abebooks).\n\ud83d\udcb0 What? No, of course not. Besides, I know you\u2019re the type of person who understands the vital importance that commerce and patronage play in the career of an independent artist!\n\ud83d\ude80 BUT, here\u2019s what I WILL give you for free: a PDF download of my previous Wondermark collection. \nYeah! Totally free!! Just for reading this project description!\n\ud83c\udfa9 This way, without spoiling what\u2019s going to be in the new book, I can give you a sense of Wondermark the comic strip (if you haven\u2019t read much of it) AND ALSO, an example of what my book collections in particular tend to look like! **EDITED TO ADD: This free giveaway was during the live campaign only! Thanks to everyone who took advantage of it!**\n\ud83d\udc01 Click through this image (or this text) to Gumroad:\n(Clicking this image will take you to Gumroad to download the file)\n\ud83d\udcbe You are, of course, welcome to download and keep this file EVEN IF you don\u2019t choose to back this campaign! I hope you enjoy it!!\n\ud83d\udcd8 At the base level, you can get the book, of course!\n\ud83d\udccc You can also get the book paired with a FRIENDSHIP PACK of three enamel pins for $25 more:\n\u270f\ufe0f You can also commission an ARTIST EDITION, which will come with an original hand-drawn illustration (by me) on an adhesive-backed bookplate. You can stick the bookplate into the book, or keep it separate as a frame-ready drawing!\nBookplate design not final. And your image will vary, natch\n\ud83d\udcda You can get various MEGA BUNDLES with copies of my PREVIOUS BOOKS, in case you need to round out your collection...\n\ud83d\udca3 And of course there are a bunch of higher-end MADNESS TIERS if you are so inclined \u2013 see the sidebar list for full details.\n\ud83c\udf9b\ufe0f To add additional items to your pledge, add the amount listed below to your pledge amount. (Adding multiple items is fine!) \n\ud83d\uddf3\ufe0f Once the campaign is over, we'll send you a form so you can specify which exact items you want!\nA note on international shipping:\nEach reward tier has a base shipping cost that you\u2019ll see added once you click through and indicate where in the world the package will be sent.\nIf you want to add anything additional to your order from the add-on list above, you\u2019ll need to manually add the cost of the additional item and (if indicated) an additional shipping cost to your pledge total.\nHere\u2019s an example:\nSo that\u2019s what that $8 for international shipping over in the reward tier descriptions is referring to. It\u2019s not the total shipping cost, but the additional shipping cost.\nAnd yeah, these costs suck. If you\u2019re interested, I\u2019ve explained more in this update!\n\ud83c\udf89 I\u2019ll be very grateful! This book has been a long time coming and I\u2019ll be really excited to see it finally heave itself into the world, laden with laughs and bursting with charm and good humor. (Your results may vary)\nHooray! We\u2019ve been fortunate enough to fully fund this campaign. Now there are some stretch goals we\u2019re working toward:\n\ud83d\uddef\ufe0f BACKER COUNT GOAL \u2013 \u2606 HIT! \u2606 We hit 400 backers on this campaign, so every book will ship with a sheet of perfectly-to-scale WORD BALLOON STICKERS. In case the book contains any comics you don\u2019t find funny, with these stickers you\u2019ll be able to cover up the bad bits and write your own punchlines, or replace them with provided generic punchlines!\nThey will also be compatible with any other comic strip collection, comic book, or any printed image anywhere in the world. \n\ud83d\uddef\ufe0f\ud83d\uddef\ufe0f DOLLAR AMOUNT GOALS \u2013 For every $2500 we raise past our initial funding goal of $12,500, we\u2019ll add 4 more pages to the book.\n\ud83d\udca1 FIRST GOAL HIT! \u2606 $15,000 has made the book 132 pages! \n\ud83d\udca1 SECOND GOAL HIT! \u2606 $17,500 has made the book 136 pages!\ud83d\udca1 THIRD GOAL HIT! \u2606 $20,000 has made the book 140 pages!\n\ud83d\udca1 FOURTH GOAL HIT! \u2606 $22,500 has made the book 144 pages! \nNEXT GOAL: $25,000 will make the book 148 pages! \nThat's it! I\u2019ll keep cramming MORE COMICS into the VERY SAME book!

I have a lot of books and I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll ever even get around to reading them all! \n\ud83d\udc8c Yet I have sometimes backed campaigns not primarily for the reward, but also because I like the idea of being a small part of what that creator is making and doing. And I want to participate in the fun! \n\ud83e\udd37 If you\u2019re not sure if you want this book, here\u2019s what I\u2019d ask you as a friend, ignoring for a moment that we\u2019re on opposite sides of a transaction here:\n\u2022 Do you want a book that doesn\u2019t have to be read sequentially, but can be left on the coffee table and read a few pages at a time, in any order?\n\u2022 Do you have friends who\u2019re cool and smart and funny, and you want to get them a gift (or casually leave something sitting out) that proves that you\u2019re the same way too?\n\u2022 Do you like humor that\u2019s silly without being too mean; sarcastic without being nihilistic; weird without being meaninglessly obtuse; and that tries hard never to punch down? \n \u2022 Is it important to you to support independent artists who make work that you enjoy?\n\u2022 Did you download the PDF of my previous book, higher up on the page? That\u2019ll give you a GREAT idea of whether you might like this new book!\n\ud83d\ude4f I hope that helps you figure out if this might be a project for you!\n\ud83d\udce6 Here\u2019s a brief summary of each of my previous books, so you can decide if you want to add any of them on to your pledge!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis will be the fifth proper Wondermark book collection, and will be about the FIFTIETH book I have shepherded to print for myself or others.

The first two have happened to me on previous projects and the third would be unsurprising. If the books are printed, all we can do is wait for them to arrive. If they are not yet printed and we suspect an issue, we have the option of changing printers and using a domestic company instead, possibly at increased cost to me personally.

These coins will be sold separately in the future, but they will not be included in the retail version of the game.\nThese are the coins from Near and Far, but they give you an idea of what the Ancient World coins will look like.

Five tribes have been fleeing from the titans for centuries, but things are about to change. Growing city-states pledge to end the reign of terror, determined to take on the titans and make the world a safer place for all. Each city-state competes to attract the tribes, eager for the strength of the combined peoples, with the hope that the titans can be defeated once and for all. \nIn The Ancient World, players compete to grow the largest and most influential city-state by managing citizens, treasury, and military and by defeating titans. Players take turns sending citizens to take special actions or using military cards to attack titans. One of the actions a citizen can perform is to build Empire cards, which give more citizens, money, and abilities. A city-state's influence in the world is measured by sets of tribe banners that it owns. Each Empire card has one or more tribe banners, and tribe banners can also be gained by defeating titans. Players gain victory points (VPs) for sets of tribe banners. After six rounds, the player with the most VPs from sets of tribe banners wins. \nWhat are people saying about the 1st edition?\nMina's Fresh Cardboard\nMina's Not-So-Mini Review - Ancient World With 2 \n\"The beautiful artwork, the brisk pace of the game, the engaging decision-making, and the bit of luck pressing all contribute to creating a thoughtful and engrossing experience.

International shipments will be subject to customs charges depending on the country to which you are shipping.\nRetail Version: The standard retail version of The Ancient World (2nd Edition) will have an MSRP of $59.99. It will not have metallic ink and not be numbered. It will include some stretch goals we reach here, but it will not include the metal coins.\nUpgrade Pack: The upgrade pack gives you all components necessary to update the game play of your 1st edition of The Ancient World. It will include a complete set of new cards, new players boards, rule book, and ambrosia tokens. This upgrade pack does not include the metal coins but those will be available as an add-on in the pledge manager. This upgrade pack does not upgrade the board, box, dice, or original tokens, (otherwise, an upgrade pack would not have been feasible). \nIMPORTANT NOTE: When playing with the 1st edition board, you will need to ignore the old placement rules and symbols. These symbols are minimal and are only there to remind you of the rules, so it shouldn't affect game play in any noticeable way. \nRulebook: WIP released soon.\nChanging Backer Levels: For this project we are unable to change or accept alterations to the backer level rewards. After the project ends, backers can add additional copies and a few other limited Red Raven products to their rewards through the pledge manager.\nIt is possible that this game will be printed later by international publishers in various languages.

Each turn provides players a wide array of options and tools to pull ahead. You can focus on improving the lands of your kingdom, upgrading from simple meadows to a thriving economic engine. Or perhaps you'd rather battle your way to victory, plundering the other kingdoms' riches. With limited space to build and only three positions for key advisers, strategic decisions must be made to guarantee victory.\n Now unlocked, the Trade Route. \nA free mini-expansion for backers of any physical copy pledge. The Trade Route includes supplemental rules featuring a card drafting mechanic, new interaction using the Riches cards, and a new beautifully illustrated center game board -- now unlocked!\nNew Trade Route cards have been unlocked!\nRuler Traits have been unlocked for backers!\nAn optional mini-expansion that adds more depth, asymmetry, and replay value. Wall your kingdom off, by taking the Isolationist Trait, or hoard as much gold as you can, by taking the Avaricious Trait. Bring your kingdom to new heights with the Ambitious Trait, or swindle your opponents with the Mercantile Trait.\nIn the solo mode, race against an ever-expanding rival as you try to out-build and outscore the shadow kingdom.  \nA second solo mode, Conquest of the King, has been unlocked!! \nRead more details about this lite dungeon crawling mode, here!\nGeek Spiel\nUnfiltered Gamer\nSkip to example turn here.

Each hand is like a little puzzle where I need to figure out how to get the most value from it.\" -VVildcard\nUnedited audio from a blind playtest at a convention:\n [More reviews coming soon]\nThe current rules can be found here.\nSolo mode game play video with the developer\nI missed counting 2 VP for the Shadow Kingdom, can anyone figure out how many points the Shadow Kingdom had, and if I won this game or not? The rule book might come in handy! Comment if you've figured it out.\nGame Overview from Board Game Coffee\nSet up\nThe Basic, Intermediate, and Advanced decks are placed in the middle of the table. Each player sets a Kingdom Board, 3 Riches cards, and a Center Land card in front of them\nAction Phase \nEach player gets 3 actions per turn to improve their kingdoms, progress to better decks, and gather as many victory points as possible.\nActions\n Playing a card from their hand \n Drawing or drafting a Basic card\nPlayers will play Land, Person, Event and Victory cards as they advance their kingdom.\nLand Cards - The foundation of any kingdom. With only 8 tiles available for land cards players must make their choices carefully. Resource land cards can stack and upgrade resource cards of the same type.\nPerson Cards - The life force of a kingdom. Person cards will add resource, strength and defense to your kingdom and will play a vital role in balancing war and prosperity.\nEvent Cards - Events can alter the course of medieval history, but make sure it's in your favor. A key component to player interactivity, these cards add another layer of strategy. As you progress to higher decks, the event cards become more powerful allowing for victory point swings and keeping each game close right down to the very end. \nVictory Cards - Great achievements rewarded only to those that seize the opportunity. Victory cards allows players to boost their kingdom to glory, provided they meet the demands.\nDiscard Phase\nEach player can then choose to discard any number of cards from their hand. They will redraw back to their maximum hand size during the final phase of their turn.\nDeck Check Phase \nEach player checks to see if they can upgrade their kingdom based on the level of cards they have in play. Once a player has met the requirements, they can upgrade their kingdom and Center Land. They will be able to draw according to their upgraded Kingdom Level in the next phase.\nDraw Phase\nAt the end of a player\u2019s turn, they draft or draw cards back to their maximum hand size. Each card in the draft is replaced when selected. The maximum hand size by default is 5, but it can be expanded by certain cards.\nEnd of Game \nThere is an \u201cAge of Enlightenment\u201d card within the Advanced deck. When this card is drawn, each player will play one final turn. After all turns are played, each player will count their current Victory Points (VP). The player with the most VPs wins!\nSolo Mode\nRace Against the Shadow Kingdom\nIn the Solo mode, the game's setup, player turn actions, and player scoring are identical to the normal rules. After each turn the player takes, cards are drawn and placed face up for the Shadow Kingdom. The amount and type of cards drawn for the Shadow Kingdom depends on the player's current kingdom progression. The player can use Event cards against the Shadow Kingdom but be warned, if Event cards are drawn by the Shadow Kingdom there are unique effects that may occur.\nAfter the player draws the Age of Enlightenment card, the player's Victory Points are compared against the Shadow Kingdoms, the latter using a special scoring method.\nConquest of the King\nRead more details about this lite dungeon crawling mode, here!\nNaming Rules  \nKeeping the medieval theme is very important to us. We want backers to be able to include their own personal touch to our game but it must fit the following rules. \nFor the Person Cards, this can be any variant of First Name, Last Name and a Title within 35 characters. Land card names can be more flexible but all must stay within the theme.\nWe will work with you to agree upon a name but we reserve the right to decline any name that we feel would be detrimental to the game\nThere will be a deadline for sending your name requests to us. If you do not meet this deadline, we won't be able to use your chosen name. You will still be printed as a SIlver or Gold supporter in the rule book.\nThere will be a deadline for sending in a photo for your portrait to be added in to the game. Our talented illustrator, Jeff, may have some preferences in lighting or pose, so sending a couple reference images will help.\nThe Portrait tier will have our Illustrator, Jeff Porter, paint you into the game. Your portrait will match the art style of the game in this unique opportunity. \n (An example of my lovely wife as the Farm Hand.)\n Language translation\nWe are planning on having the rules be translated to the following languages available online as a PDF: German, Spanish, Italian, French, and Portuguese.

Regularly expanded and polished since 2012, Snowdonia makes a grand return to gamers\u2019 tables in this Kickstarter Limited project for veterans and all new fans alike!  \nSnowdonia Deluxe Master Set is a Kickstarter Limited project. This means that it will be available primarily during this Kickstarter. After the game is manufactured, you may still be able to purchase a limited number of copies from us at conventions or on special offers, but at a higher price. Snowdonia Deluxe Master Set is a specialist project, very broad and ambitious in scope, and that is why it will not enter regular distribution.\nSnowdonia is a game with simple and polished rules - the following six steps will let you start exploring its depth in no time:\n1. Place your workers on action spaces, resolve from left to right:\n2. Excavate the way for tracks and stations:\n3. Lay tracks, raise structures:\n4. Use abilities of your engines and contracts (this can happen at different times of the turn):\n5. Draw new resources and events:\n6. Check the weather to prepare for the next turn:\nWould you like to see the game played?

However, there is even more the game can come with:\nSince Snowdonia Deluxe Master Set will come in a huge and heavy box, and it is bound to still grow, shipping costs will be added after the Kickstarter project is finished, using Backer Kit. Before pledging make sure that your region or country is present in the pledge level\u2019s shipping list, as Snowdonia Deluxe Master set does not ship anywhere in the world. Here is a list of estimated shipping costs to different regions of the world: \nThe cost of shipping the Seasoned Traveller pledge will be a flat cost of about $7 worldwide. As a significant part of new art and graphic design includes any new content, the delivery dates for the expansion are the same as those for Snowdonia Deluxe Master Set.\nThe above list is an estimation. Shipping costs for some regions may drop slightly before we close Backer Kit. \nFor most regions of the world, Snowdonia Deluxe Master Set will arrive in May of 2019. However, there are some locations with exceptionally long shipping times. So, if you are located in South America, Central America or Australia, although we will send your pledges first, you will probably wait for your copy of Snowdonia Deluxe Master Set until August or September 2019.\n                                                                                                                                                             Below you will find all the relevant information.

You must carefully manage your blueprints, train your workers, and manufacture as many goods as possible in order to achieve industrial dominance!\nFantastic Factories is a dice placement, engine building tabletop game for 1 to 5 players and takes 45 to 60 minutes to play. Players build a set of factories into their compound and then roll dice to use as workers. With over 35 different blueprints, you can discover endless inventive and creative ways your factories can work together. \nDifferent factories have different worker requirements. Some require a pair of matching dice. Some require a specific value. You aren't stuck with what you roll, though. With training facilities you can manipulate the values of your dice in order to figure out the optimal placement of all your workers! Each turn is a satisfying puzzle to solve. \nThere are over 35 unique buildings!\n                                                                             28 dice (16mm) (4 red, 4 blue, 4 green, 4 yellow, 4 purple, and 8 white)\n50 energy resource tokens\n30 metal* resource tokens (*clarification: represents metal resources in the game but made out of chipboard)\n85 goods tokens\n4 tool label tokens\n78 blueprint cards\n18 contractor cards\n1 first player token\n5 player boards and player aids\n Fantastic Factories comes with over 40 unique blueprint and contractor cards, ensuring each game is a fresh and new experience with lots of replayability.\nPromo Cards\nPledge now to receive 4 bonus blueprints and 1 bonus contractor!\nKickstarter backers will also receive 5 promotional cards FREE! After the Kickstarter campaign these cards will only be available at conventions or through other exceptional means. \nPlease note that the art and components are not completely finalized and may change slightly.\nIn Fantastic Factories, your goal is to build the most prestigious buildings and manufacture the most goods. Players start with 4 blueprints and some resources (1 metal, 2 energy). Players also have 4 colored dice that act as their workers.\nMarket Phase\nEach round begins with the market phase. On your turn you either select a face-up blueprint to add into your hand for free or discard a card to hire the corresponding contractor. Contractors have unique effects that allow you do things such as roll additional dice or gain resources. \nTake a blueprint or hire a contractor.\nOnce all players have taken a turn, the work phase begins. \nExample of some contractors you can hire.\nWork Phase\nDuring the work phase players take their turns simultaneously. You start by rolling your dice. Then you can take various actions in any order. \nYou can place your workers on a set of basic actions to gain more resources or draw cards:\nBasic actions let you draw cards and gain resources.\nYou can build cards by discarding another card with the same tool symbol and paying the resource cost: \nBuilding a Nuclear Plant.\nAnd finally you can activate your cards (yes, even on the same turn you built it!). Training facilities help you get the correct value workers to run your factories. \nSequencing your actions correctly can allow you to maximize your turn!\nOnce all players are finished with their turns, the round is complete, and another one begins with the market phase again. If any players have manufactured 12 or more goods or have built 10 or more cards, the following round is the final round.\nSolo Game\nFantastic Factories supports playing solo. You still get to build awesome combinations of factories and strategize where best to place your workers. The only difference is you will be competing against a simple but efficient opponent known as \"The Machine\". The Machine is easily managed and guided by dice rolls and can be adjusted for varying levels of challenge. More details can be found in the rulebook. \nFantastic Factories is that perfect mix of approachability and strategic depth. The mechanics and rules are simple but the creative combinations of factories and numerous ways you can manipulate your dice make each game feel new and fresh. We've played the game more than 300 times, and we still enjoy playing it. \nWith simultaneous play, each game takes an hour or less so you know you'll be able to get it to the table time and time again and even play games back to back. With so many viable strategies to pursue, you'll be exploring the depths of Fantastic Factories for many games.\nSome of you may be waiting for the game to hit retail stores instead of pledging now. We would love to be in retail but getting the attention of distributors largely depends on the success of the Kickstarter campaign. There is a very real possibility that Fantastic Factories may never be available at retail outside of retailers who choose to back the Kickstarter. We know there's always risk in backing a Kickstarter so as a thanks for joining us on this journey, we've priced the pledge levels below our anticipated MSRP and are also including promo cards that will not be widely available through retailers that receive the game through distribution.\nRetailers\nInterested retailers should back at the retailer pledge level. We plan on charging standard retailer pricing and delivering the games well before normal distribution (if we even end up with a distributor). After you pledge, we will reach out with details about pricing. If you choose not to purchase for any reason we can refund your deposit pledge. Beyond the initial pledge there is no money due until just before fulfillment at which time you can specify your desired quantity and we will invoice you. The MSRP of the game will be $40. If you are a retailer and have any questions you can send us an email at retail@fantasticfactories.com.\nCheck out this 3 player full playthrough by JonGetsGames: \nYou can also see Jambalaya go through the first few rounds of a SOLO game:\nFantastic Factories is available on both Tabletop Simulator and Tabletopia.

You can find the latest rulebook here. \nWhat are stretch goals? Meeting our funding goal allows us to place an order with our manufacturer for the minimum order quantity. However, the more quantity we order, the cheaper it is to manufacture each individual copy. We reinvest these savings into upgrading the components of the game. That means the more funding we receive, the better the game will be for you! Sharing this project with people you know helps us improve the game.\nPlease note that our stretch goals for the game itself are component upgrades ONLY. We do not believe in additional content or gameplay as stretch goals because we have thoroughly play tested the game with all the content that we believe is necessary for a balanced game and the best possible gameplay experience. No more. No less.\nDigital Puzzle Book Stretch Goal\nWe'd like to release a printable PDF that includes a curated selection of One Turn Puzzles and solutions.\nOn July 6, if there are 50 or more puzzles on the BGG forum AND 200 or more thumbs up collectively on the puzzles, we will release a PDF puzzle book complete with final art and layout. We will also credit each puzzle creator in this book. There are already 10+ puzzles and 20+ thumbs up in the forum right now.\nBut there are only a few short days before the campaign ends! That's why we are extending the deadline of this stretch goal to July 6th. That's still only a short week and a half away so don't wait too long to get involved.\nWhen we were selected for the PAX South Indie Showcase in January 2017, we were faced with a conundrum. How could we possibly demo our 1 hour game to the masses on the show floor of PAX?\nAnd that's how we came up with the Puzzles. They are literally snapshots of a single turn in Fantastic Factories, taken at the moment right after you've rolled your dice. The challenge is the same as your final turn in the full game: make as many points as possible, given these dice, resources, and buildings in your compound.\nHere are a couple of them, see if you can figure them out!\nInstructions: Manufacture as many Goods as possible by assigning the dice (with values as shown). Each building card has an ability on its bottom half that you may use, but you may not use the same building twice.\n(Note: you can ignore the build costs in the top left corner of the cards. These cards have been pre-built for you)\nAn Introductory Puzzle\nDojo flips a die to its opposite side. Warehouse requires 3 dice, and those dice must sum to 14 or more.\nSee solution.\nAnother Puzzle!\nManufacture as many goods as possible!\n See solution.\nSolve More Puzzles, and Create Your Own!\nDiscover (and try to solve) more puzzles on our forum on Board Game Geek (some of them are challenging).\nAlso, check out this post to find out how you can create and share your own Fantastic Factories One Turn Puzzle for others to try to solve!\nIf enough people submit puzzles by July 6, then Joseph and I will put together a printable PDF of the best puzzles (with solutions) so you can bring them to game night!

They have a great reputation as experts in shipping and will be assisting us with coordinating shipping games across the world. As a result, shipping will be EU, AUS, and CAN friendly with no additional VAT being charged separately to backers. \nShipping is one of the most expensive parts of bringing a Kickstarter game to life. We estimate that shipping within the US will cost $12 per game, but we wanted to subsidize the shipping and split the cost with our backers. That means US backers will only be charged $6 for shipping for a single copy and we will cover the other $6. For non-US backers, we will still subsidize the shipping costs for $6 but the shipping cost to backers will vary by region. To see the shipping cost to your region, select the pledge level and then select your region.\nTwo Pack Bundle\nWe know that even with the subsidy that shipping can still be a lot. That's why we are also offering a pledge level for 2-game bundles at a significantly lower shipping price per game. For example a 2-game bundle being shipped to the EU would save you $11.\n3+ Copies\nIf you want to order more than 2 copies of Fantastic Factories, you can select the Two-Pack Bundle pledge and pledge an additional amount:\nFor Continental US/EU/Norway/Canada/AUS/China you should pledge for the Two-Pack Bundle and then add an additional $31 for each extra copy you want (this amount includes the additional shipping). \nFor Alaska/Hawaii, add $37 per extra copy.\nFor Puerto Rico, add $36 per extra copy.\nFor New Zealand, add $36 per extra copy. \nFor Taiwan, Thailand, Vietnam, South Korea, Singapore, Malaysia, and Japan, add $33 per extra copy. \nAnd for the rest of the world, add $40 per extra copy. \nWe are not offering any group buy discounts outside of the shipping savings.\nFor example, if you live in Belgium, the Two-Pack Bundle is $56 plus $15 shipping (total of $71). If you would like 4 copies of the game, you would add $31 for each additional copy so your pledge should be for a total of $133.\nIf you are currently pledged at the Retailer pledge level but are not a retailer, please switch your pledge to the Two-Pack Bundle and adjust your pledge amount for the quantity you want.\nWho are we?

The collection and artifacts will be packaged in a unique box - available only through this Kickstarter, with a limited run, for a limited time. (Seriously, the games will be available later, but the special packaging and artifacts will not be sold again!)\n* The campaign is over! Wow!\nThanks so much for the amazing support! We're working hard on the artifacts, and for more info on the games go to myst.com!\nIn the fall of 1993, Cyan released Myst \u2013 the surreal, graphical adventure game that provided an entirely new kind of experience for millions of virtual explorers. Surpassing Cyan\u2019s wildest expectations, it not only became the bestselling PC game of the 20th century, it also had a direct influence on popular culture. Over the years, Myst has brought together communities of passionate fans and has been referenced in television shows, movies, books, comics, and more. Myst has also inspired other creators as they built their own unique realms. Myst has even earned spots in the Smithsonian Institute, MoMA, and other notable museums.    \nAll 7 Myst Games Together for the First Time \nLooking back on this incredible, 25-year journey, Cyan believes a celebration is in order! We recognize this amazing achievement could not have happened without each and every one of you who have found your way to this Kickstarter. You have embraced the intricacies, oddities and mysteries in the Myst worlds \u2013 and have come back for more. So, as 2018 marks the 25th anniversary of Myst, Cyan is taking our journey together one step further.\nBehind the scenes, we\u2019ve been working to procure the legal rights to make all of the Myst games available. As an indie developer, resources are limited for development, and acquiring these rights isn\u2019t always an option. But we\u2019ve finally managed to talk with all the right people in all the right places to garner funds to make it happen! With the needed agreements secured, we\u2019re delighted to present the Myst 25th Anniversary Collection, featuring all seven titles in the Myst series!\nWith the help of our friends at GOG.com and CodeWeavers the games have been upgraded to run on Windows 10 and macOS 10.13 (High Sierra). This Kickstarter will provide the entire Windows collection in a special exclusive package, but the updated versions of the games will also make their way to digital download services, starting with GOG.com, as automatic updates.\nSpecial Artifacts Only on Kickstarter\nBut we didn\u2019t stop there. We wanted to extract the essence of Myst\u2019s enigmatic aura and make it come alive \u2013 to touch, to hold, to remember...\nSo, we joined forces with Idea Planet, a unique group of talented folks who make realistic video game artifacts that wow. Chances are, you\u2019ve seen \u2013 or have \u2013 some of their really cool collector\u2019s editions. Check out their portfolio by clicking on the link in their logo above. We are thrilled to be working with them on our very own Myst 25th Anniversary Collection!\nNow on to the good stuff \u2013 the details you\u2019ve been waiting for!\nThe Linking Book\nThe core of the collector\u2019s edition will be a Myst Linking Book. The Bookmaker tier book will have a die-cut \u201cwindow\u201d through which you can see the art on the game DVD sleeves. At the Maintainer tier and above, the book will include an active 800 x 480 digital screen with video fly-throughs from the games.\nDimensions: 7in x 9in x 2.5in (18cm x 25 cm x 6 cm)\nWindow cutout: 5in x 2.75in  (12cm x 7cm) \nMaterials: 1200g grey board & art paper, with Matte Finish \nEmbossed & gold foil on Logo & edges of leather art treatments \nWeight:  2.71 pounds (1.23kg)\n1:1 exact scale replica\n800 x 480 IPS high resolution LCD screen (Maintainer tier)\nSpeaker (Maintainer tier)\nGehn\u2019s Inkwell and Pen \nThe Writer tier and above will feature an authentic replica of Gehn\u2019s Pen and Inkwell, meticulously recreated. And yes, it holds your ink, so it\u2019s a functioning set! (D'ni Writer's Ink or common ink not included.)\nThis tier also now includes digital versions of the three Myst novels (The Book of Atrus, The Book of Ti'ana, and The Book of D'ni) as well as high-resolution scans of some of the Riven design maps.\nGehn\u2019s Pen: \nDimensions: 7in (17.78cm) in length \nMaterials: Wood & Metal Accents \nGehn\u2019s Inkwell: \nDimensions 5.25in x 3.5in (13.35cm x 8.89cm)\nMaterials: Die Cast Zinc Alloy \nDeco: Antiqued Brass Plating \nWeight: 1.75lbs (.8kg)\n\nOriginal Design Sketches from Riven\nThis Collector tier is extremely limited and very special. We've opened the vault and collected 25 original hand-drawn concept sketches made during the production of Riven. These are not copies or reproductions. These are the actual pencil sketches with all of their variations, notes, smudges, and watermarks. Many of them have never been seen publicly before.\nMyst's 25th anniversary offers us a rare opportunity to provide these images to serious fans of the Myst series. Each unique hand-sketched drawing comes with a certificate of authenticity. \nSince these items are so unique, each backer at this level will get to choose which sketch they prefer. The order of the choice will be based on when the backer made their pledge - first pledge chooses first, second pledge chooses second, etc. And because we'd really like to spread the love around, we're limiting this tier to one per backer. You can see the available concept images here.\nA Word to Mac Users \nMyst started out as a Mac-first title, and over the years, Cyan has always released each of our games for the Mac. But for various reasons, maintaining some of those Mac titles now usually means rebuilding them from scratch - an option that, as a small indie studio, takes time or resources we just don\u2019t have. And for games that were produced by other studios, even that option wasn't possible.\nBut Mac users rejoice! After some research and testing, and the help of CodeWeavers, we've been able to come up with a solution that allows us to offer digital and disc versions of all of the games in this Anniversary Collection for macOS.\nWhy the $247,500 target amount?\nTo deliver a high-quality Myst collector\u2019s edition at a reasonable price, we need to have a minimum number of orders. Based on quotes for the design, tooling and manufacturing, we've calculated that we need at least 2,500 orders at the $99 tier or above (2,500 * $99 = $247,500) to achieve the bare minimum and move forward.\nReward Tier Summary\nCommunity Goals \nThank you for completing our community goals! \n\n.\nThat means everyone in the community \u2013 whether they\u2019ve backed this Kickstarter or not, whether they\u2019re a long-time veteran fan or new to the Mystiverse \u2013 can enjoy these items.\n\n5 High-resolution images from Myst - angles never before rendered \n5 Scans of the Riven Concept Art hanging in Cyan's Office \n5 VR nodes on the original Myst Island (viewable via Google Cardboard) \n5 Complete Digital Age design documents from Ages in Uru \n5 3D printable files for items in Myst\nA link to the downloads will be available soon. \n\nYOU DID IT!\n\nShipping and Fulfillment\nUnfortunately, shipping costs have skyrocketed over the past several years. To help insure our shipping is as high quality and as low cost as possible, we have partnered with Blackbox who has globally positioned facilities to help minimize customs fees and VAT. Additionally, we have simplified the rate structure and even subsidized shipping rates in many cases. Please note the shipping cost when you select your pledge level.\nThanks, Adam!\nOkay Adam, we know you have some kind of reputation for ruining everything, but you sure helped us out. Seriously, having Adam as the voice of this Kickstarter pitch was such an amazing boost! If his energy, enthusiasm, and brilliance doesn't infect you, then you're probably not breathing. Thank you so much, Adam. Your linking book is on the way (after September.)\nAbout Cyan \nCyan was started in 1987 by brothers Rand and Robyn Miller when they released a new kind of children\u2019s software they called The Manhole. It was a simple, whimsical, black & white world to explore with very little to get in the way of the journey. After that was Cosmic Osmo and Spelunx \u2013 two more rich, non-threatening worlds for children to explore. In 1991, Cyan began work on a much larger world they called Myst. Myst and its sequel Riven have sold more than 15 million copies worldwide \u2013 which made them the best-selling computer games of the 20th century. After five titles in the Myst series, Cyan turned its attention to making an ambitious, never-ending world that would allow players to explore together. Uru: Ages Beyond Myst. (Myst Online is still available to explore for free.) In 2013, Cyan launched a Kickstarter campaign to help fund an entirely new game - Obduction. The campaign succeeded, and Obduction was successfully launched on PC, Mac, PS4, and VR.\nCyan is located on the northern outskirts of Spokane, Washington, about 119 trillion miles from the nearest habitable planet. We continue to build on our past as we dream into the future.\nThank you! \nOur fans are the best! You'll never know how much we appreciate your continued support over the years.

Hunt", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Dual Powers: Revolution 1917 is an area control strategy game for 1-2 players. Each player directs the forces of the conservative Provisional Government or the socialist activists of the Petrograd Soviet in a struggle for power and influence that will shape Russia\u2019s future and either launch or suppress the impending civil war.\nIn Dual Powers: Revolution 1917, each game round is divided into 5 phases --  the Draw Phase, the Objective Phase, the Action Phase, the Scoring Phase, and the Cleanup Phase. \nDRAW PHASE - Each player draws 5 command cards. \nOBJECTIVE PHASE - Each player selects a secret objective, placing it face down on the game board. \nACTION PHASE - Taking turns, each player plays 4 command cards to recruit units, move units, refresh units, or take a leader's special ability. With each card played, the date on the calendar advances, and players will sometimes earn a bonus action. \nSCORING PHASE - Up to 3 regions of the board are scored based on which player has the greatest strength, including the region of unrest, and each of the players' secret objectives. Tokens in the scored regions are exhausted. \nCLEANUP PHASE - The region of unrest and the placement of the blockade token changes. All played cards and the players' secret objectives are discarded. \nIf either player moves the marker on the support track to the \"victory\" space on their side of the board, they immediately win. Otherwise, at the end of the round in which the month marker is on the October space or later, the game ends and the player with the most support is the winner!\nWant to take a closer look to how the game works?

A lot of interesting decisions in the game.\" -- Jeremy Salinas, Man vs. Meeple\n\"Dual Powers is easy to learn, and difficult to master. Players will continually explore layers of deep strategy every time it hits the table!\" -- Derek Funkhouser, Boardgame Spotlight\n\"Super Dynamic.... creates for really fun head-to-head play.... It plays pretty quickly and works well. \" -- Eduardo Baraf, Pencil First Games\n \"It\u2019s a card-driven game. It\u2019s an engine I like very much, a mechanic I like very much when it comes to historical games....This is a fun game that I find quite enjoyable.\u201d - Marco \"Wargamer\" Arnaudo, Game Reviewer\n\"This is the highest rating I've ever given a Kickstarter preview, and the game totally deserves it!... Honestly, I don't have any criticisms of the game. It's easy to learn, fast to play, balanced, exciting, fun, and even a bit educational. There's nothing here not to like.\" - George Jaros, Game Reviewer at GJJ Games\n\u201cI played Dual Powers as a prototype more than a year ago during development, and I wished I could buy it on the spot! The game has a high degree of strategic depth and subterfuge that cleverly emulates the time period and events it represents.\u201d - Scott Bogen, Game Reviewer for the Boardgame Show\n\"Dual Powers has all the elements of a classic card game and the feeling of a tight 2 player war game. Lots of double thinking your opponent and hoping your long term strategy pays off. Can't wait to see this in print!\" - Jeph Stahl, co-designer of Academy Games' Birth of America series\n\"I'm a Kickstarter curmudgeon. Despite hanging out and running campaigns on Kickstarter for years, I have yet to back a single game. That's changing when Dual Powers goes live. I love everything about it: the viscerally beautiful art, the original mechanics (OH THE CALENDAR MECHANIC), the fact that it's tuned like a fine Stradivarius for one and two players, and most of all, the way a few simple rules magically conspire to thrust me into the middle of the Russian Revolution. I'm beyond smitten.\" -- Nick Bentley, designer/developer/marketer at North Star Games (Evolution, Happy Salmon)\n\"Dual Powers is a smart, engaging mix of modern and traditional gameplay. Cleverly invoking what\u2019s fun \u2014 and familiar \u2014 about cribbage, it goes on to deliver a completely new experience set against a flavorful historical backdrop. The first time I played Dual Powers, when the game ended, I demanded that we immediately play again. If you enjoy games like Twilight Struggle, you owe it to yourself to try Dual Powers.\" - Jeff Tidball, designer/writer (Horus Heresy, Pieces of Eight, Dragon Age RPG)\n\"I actually like how the game feels, plays and looks. I do get that feeling of being immersed in the political upheaval but in a light, slightly removed, almost passive way...

You are still welcome to use the normal pledge levels however these may include VAT fees dependant on your country. The EU pledge levels are mainly available for countries with a lower VAT threshold and for EU and UK backers who wish to purchase more than one game.\n Shipping fees for the Normal Basic and All-Weather Pledges. \nThe below prices and countries do not apply to the EU Friendly pledge levels.\n    Portal Dragon is committed to delivering quality games and components while keeping communication with the community through the entire process.

I didn't realize how important this could be to certain gamers. Through playtesting I had numerous stories shared about how this game fit different players' lifestyles. Some people are always on the on the go, have limited table space, or spend a lot of time in one place, like a hospital. It gave me a greater perspective on who plays games and what they want or need as players. This makes me excited to address that with this game and in future designs.\"", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis will be Portal Dragon's 3rd Kickstarter project.

The two went out to the EU and to the USA and I still have no answer as to why the 3rd shipment did not leave at the same time. I received the shipment in the USA and found hundreds of damaged products. Spiral Galaxy reported the same issue. To add insult to injury we paid for expedited shipping on these damaged products. I reported the damages to the manufacturer and after they denied the issues and blamed it on the shippers they finally checked the shipment that the still had not sent (still no answer why it was still there). They found 30% of these were damaged as well. I finally got the shipment off to VFI for the 3rd shipment and they are packing the shipments up. I email VFI every day asking for updates. They report that they are packing but have not shipped yet. In addition to all of this, the manufacturer has sent fewer products to each location than were ordered. They are refusing to produce replacement cases for the damaged all-weather cases so I have been forced to find another manufacturer to produce replacement waterproof cases in a pinch. The original manufacturer is also refusing to refund me for the damaged products. I am still trying to resolve these issues with them. Needless to say, I will not be working with that manufacturer in the future.

It was they who founded Gravehold, our last bastion, and if you wish to stand beside these living legends, you must listen and learn. The Nameless shall come again, as they always have, and you will need to be ready. You are the hope of our future.\u201d \nAs a young apprentice, you grew up to stories of the breach mages. Brama, the teacher, wisest of the mages. Dezmodia, the prodigy, master of great magic. Mist, the stoic leader and tactical genius. Malastar, the magical craftsman. Rebellious, powerful, and reckless perfectly sum up Xaxos. These mages are your heroes and tomorrow, after your ordeal, you will join their ranks. \n\u201cEach of you must overcome your ordeal to learn discipline and focus, the tools you will need to defend Gravehold.\" Brama continues.  \"We are nothing without Gravehold. To be a breach mage is to sacrifice your life for Gravehold. When you die, it will be in defense of our city. Once you understand this universal truth...only then will you be ready to become a breach mage.\u201d \nIn 2016, Action Phase Games released the critically acclaimed, cooperative deck-building game, Aeon\u2019s End. Last year Indie Boards and Cards & Action Phase Games released the exciting standalone/expansion Aeon\u2019s End: War Eternal. This year we are excited to grow the universe with Aeon's End Legacy, a standalone game that also expands all previous Aeon's End content.\nAeon's End: Legacy is a full \"campaign\", where you'll build your character over multiple \"chapters,\" fighting increasingly powerful nemeses to defend Gravehold, the last bastion of humanity. At the end of each game, you will choose new upgrades for your character and more powerful player cards to add to the market. At the end of the campaign, you'll have unique characters, new nemeses, new player cards, and new basic nemesis cards that you can play with indefinitely and/or play with all the other Aeon's End content released. If you would like to play the campaign again, we also offer a Reset Pack as an add-on.\n  Aeon\u2019s End: Legacy is a cooperative deckbuilding game for 1-4 players that plays in 60 minutes per chapter (game). Players will struggle to defend Gravehold from The Nameless and their hordes using unique abilities, powerful spells, and the help of familiar characters.\nAeon's End: Legacy uses the same critically acclaimed deck-building system made in Aeon's End. This core features a number of innovative mechanisms, including a variable turn order system that simulates the chaos of an attack and deck management rules that require careful planning.\nIf you aren\u2019t familiar with Aeon\u2019s End, you can check out the BGG page or watch The Dice Tower review, which gave Aeon's End their Seal of Excellence (and note that we've significantly updated all the graphics & components - so everything you can get from this project is re-formatted with the 2nd Edition look and feel). \nFor more information on Aeon's End: Legacy, we encourage you to view the video below, or read our draft rulebook here.\n                     PLAYTESTER REVIEWS\nDaily Worker Placement - Aeon's End: Legacy Preview\nBGG: Cold hard facts - A mostly informative Aeon's End: Legacy review from a playtester.

These items may be released at a future date as promotional materials and/or game expansions.\nKickstarter Exclusive - An exclusive item for Kickstarter backers with remaining stock available through conventions and special promotions only.\nThe Reset Pack provides all of the cards, mats, sticker sheets, and tokens that players will need to reset the game so that they can play through the campaign again. Unlike some other legacy games with reset packs, a copy of Aeon\u2019s End: Legacy can be reset any number of times. One Reset Pack will be needed each time the game is reset. Add $25 for each copy of the the Reset Pack you would like to receive.\n  Add $20 for the Accessory Pack to further enhance gameplay experience.\nThe Accessory Pack includes: \n124 Player cards - enough cards to have a unique set of starter cards for each mage included in War Eternal, Aeon\u2019s End and all the expansions. \n24 Player Dividers - Dividers for each Mage's starting deck. \n10 Translucent d10s - Life Counters for each Mage, and extras for Minions. \n 24 Translucent Charge tokens - \"Gems\" used to track charges on Player mats.  \n12 Plastic Power tokens - \"Gems\" used to track Nemesis Power cards. \n10 Plastic Nemesis tokens - \"Gems\" used to track Nemesis abilities. \nThere are limited quantities available of the Accessory Pack.\n\nThese accessories make the game easier to store, set-up, and play, on top of making the game even more visually appealing. \n  We have designed a new playmat for this Kickstarter. While it isn\u2019t necessary, the playmat, produced by Gamermats, is a high quality neoprene mat that helps organize the game and adds table presence. Add $25 to your pledge for each playmat you want.\nWe know that some backers want more than one copy of a reward level. To do this, you will need to do the following:\n1) Pledge at the highest level from which you want the rewards.\n2) Add to your pledge amount based on the add-on chart (ie, you don\u2019t have to add shipping cost for each item, just the first item. Kickstarter does automatically). \n Examples: \nYou are in the US and want two copies of Aeon's End: Legacy - Pledge $125 ($65 + $60) at the Adept ($65) pledge level. \nYou are in Canada and want two copies of Aeon's End: Legacy and one copy of the Aeon's End bundle - Pledge $210  ($130 + $60 + $20 shipping) at the Prodigy ($130) pledge level. \nYou are in Australia and want two copies of Aeon\u2019s End: Legacy, two copies of Aeon\u2019s End bundle and two copies of War Eternal bundle \u2013 Pledge $470 ($195 + $70 + $70 + $70 + $65 Shipping) at the Breach Master ($195) pledge level.\n    The Update Pack is only for those that have a 1st edition copy of Aeon\u2019s End, The Depths, and/or The Nameless and would like to get cards with the new graphic design from 2017. This pack contains all of the cards and playmats from those games with the updated graphic design from the second edition. \nAdd $10 for the Update Pack. \nThere are limited quantities available of the Update Pack. \nProof of purchase (a photo of your games) will be required for this add-on. \nNotes: \nThe 1st Edition of Aeon\u2019s End was sold in 2016, if you bought Aeon\u2019s End, Nameless or Depths in 2017 and/or our last kickstarter project, you already have the latest graphic design and don\u2019t need this Update Pack. \nThere are no new game play features in this add-on. \nThe Update Packs are not required even if you have the 1st Edition of the game. The card backs remained the same between editions and can be combined without affecting game play. \nAeon\u2019s End: Legacy, War Eternal, Void and Outer Dark and the 2nd Editions (currently being sold) or Aeon\u2019s End, Nameless and Depths all have the updated graphic design. \nIt is important that everyone knows that we are not using a pledge manager. That means you\u2019ll have to add to your pledge amount for all the add-ons that you want, before the project is completed at 10pm pacific, March 15th. To change you pledge amount, click the \u201cManage your Pledge\u201d button on the top of this page.\n  Then, click \u201cChange your Pledge\u201d, enter the new pledge amount and click \u201cContinue\u201d. The tricky part is that you\u2019ll need to calculate the total pledge amount on your own and won\u2019t get an immediate confirmation of what you have added. This has to be done before the project ends (10pm pacific, Thursday, March 15th). We will get all the details we need from you when we send the project surveys out, that will be done the week of March 19th (we need to get the information quickly in order to send the right number of games and add-ons to their fulfillment centers).\n  Aeon\u2019s End: Legacy is the 41st project from the combined teams behind Indie Boards and Cards & Action Phase Games. With the successful execution of our first 40 projects, we have become experienced publishers with a reputation for great games that are delivered in a timely fashion. \nThe previous Aeon\u2019s End games have been very well received, with over 3000 ratings with an average of 8.1 and higher on boardgamegeek.com. Aeon\u2019s End is the 216th ranked game on that website out of over 20,000 games. \nAeon\u2019s End: Legacy was designed by the talented Kevin Riley and Nick Little, the same team that designed the previous games in the series. This game has been blind tested by hundreds of people, in addition to being extensively tested in-house, ensuring that every part of the game is of the best possible quality. We are confident that this game will be in your collection for years to come. \nAeon\u2019s End: Legacy builds on the existing Aeon\u2019s End universe by introducing a rich and engaging narrative experience. It allows players to make meaningful choices during and after every game that will impact the rest of the campaign. \nThe main plot line of Aeon\u2019s End: Legacy involves the players developing from apprentice mages to full-fledged breach mages. Players will make meaningful choices about how their character develops after each game. There are over 500,000 different possible character configurations. At the end of the campaign, you will be able to use the mage you have built to fight the nemeses from other Aeon\u2019s End games. \nAt the end of each chapter, not only will players upgrade their mage, they will also gain access to new and more powerful market cards which will allow them to advance and adapt their strategy. \nAeon\u2019s End: Legacy is the first legacy deckbuilder. Since Aeon\u2019s End does not use a traditional gameboard, many innovative legacy-based mechanics were created by the design team to recreate all of the aspects that people love about legacy games. \nUnlike other legacy games, once the campaign is finished you can replay individual scenarios and nemeses as many times as you would like. Additionally, over 80% of the content is compatible with other Aeon\u2019s End games. That amount of compatible content is roughly equal to the amount of content provided in Aeon\u2019s End and The Depths combined. \nAll of the art assets are complete and ready for immediate upload after the project funds. \nPrices include US shipping. This project is also EU & Canadian friendly.\nKickstarter is the world's largest funding platform for creative projects. Every month, tens of thousands of people pledge millions of dollars to creative projects in dozens of categories. \nA person who supports a project is called a \"backer.\" The process of giving money to this project is called a \"pledge.\" \nIn return for your pledge, we (the creators of the campaign) are able to offer \"rewards,\" depending on the amount you pledge. For example, if you pledge $65 to help back the project, we'll offer you a copy of the game along with any stretch goals we achieve as soon as it is manufactured. \nYou can become a backer in just three easy steps: \nStep 1: Read through the pledge levels and rewards we're offering in the right sidebar of this page.\nStep 2: Click the large, green \"BACK THIS PROJECT\" button to the right of the trailer video at the top of this page. \nStep 3: Enter your pledge amount, and complete the steps for filling in your information. This process takes just a few seconds! That's it! It's really that simple! Thank you for backing! \nOnce you've backed this project, we encourage you to share this page on social media platforms, such as Facebook and Twitter, and share with your friends and family.

If you would like to get the rewards from this project, we suggest you back through kickstarter!\nWhile our current production schedule looks like Kickstarter rewards will ship out well before Essen, it may be the case that we have games at Essen before the Kickstarter backer copies are sent. It may also be the case that we are unable to get games to Essen in time.

We have learned how to streamline the game publishing process and have successfully delivered all of our previous Kickstarter projects to thousands of supporters. Our previous experiences will enable us to also deliver this project on time and we have every confidence that Aeon\u2019s End: War Legacy will be on schedule and of the highest possible quality.\n\nThat said, there are always complexities and considerations in a project of this scope that may cause delays. Indie Boards and Cards & Action Phase Games will use contract manufacturing to make this game, freight forwarders to get games through customs, and 3rd parties like Amazon, the US Post Office, and FEDEX to ship the games to you \u2013 we don't control everything and there are lots of opportunities for delay. We have a track record of making everything work out for backers in the end \u2013 so please be confident and supportive of our efforts to get this great game into your hands.\n\nREFUND POLICY\nWe can refund you within 14 days of the campaign\u2019s end, fees included.

However, if we\u2019ve begun packaging your pledge for shipment (usually 4 to 6 weeks before the actual shipping date), no refunds are possible. If a component cannot be delivered AT ALL, we refund that completely, including fees.\n\nAll refunds after the 14 days close of the campaign may be processed via PayPal or reversed via Stripe to your credit card at our discretion. Refunds within 14 days are reversed via Stripe to your credit card.\nThis project is being funded in USD and any refunds processed will be in USD for the exact amount received in USD, excluding any applicable fees depending on the time of the refund being processed.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look, materials, and content of the rewards (and the project) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented while the Kickstarter project was active.\n\nIf you do not log in and submit your project survey results (ie, provide us with your shipping address) for your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received.

Hunt", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Pulp Detective is a game designed by Todd Sanders for 1\u20132 players that lasts 30 minutes. You take the role of a detective who is in charge of solving a case. But you only have 24 hours to do it. \nYou need your ingenuity and flair to find 4 clues so you can confront the criminal. Grab your gun and solve the case!\n(Pour les souscripteurs fran\u00e7ais, choix de la langue lors du survey final.) \n   voici les r\u00e8gles en FR et un descriptif complet sur mon site) \nYou are italian: back the project on Giochistarter to get the italian edition\n    Pulp Detective is a card/dice/narrative game with a strong theme, that takes place in the middle of the 1930s, the golden age of pulp magazines and hardboiled movies, between the two world wars. The illustrations come from real pulp magazines covers (Black Mask, Detective Tales, Detective Fiction, Dime Detective, All Story Detective). \nWe managed to obtain the rights to use an amazing array of 58 pulp novel covers, so that we can dress this game in the period apparel that it deserves to have.\nthe 3 cases of the base game\n  Each turn of the game consists of two phases: The Storyline and the Investigation. \n- Phase 1: Storyline\nDraw 3 Investigation cards from the deck; keep one, discard one, and return the last one to the deck. You can use these Cliffhanger, Follow A Lead, and Informant cards to get new items, gain stamina, or unearth a new clue!\n- Phase 2 Investigation\nUse your stamina and the items you have to roll dice which can help you complete the task on the card you kept during the Storyline phase. Choose your dice and decide which order to roll them in, using your detective instincts to match icons.\nFind all 4 clues, and if you still have time and stamina, confront the criminal in the final showdown!\n        Because Todd Sanders, the designer is an unstoppable fountain when he starts designing, we decided to release the Pulp Detective Double cross & Masterminds expansion at the same time: More cases to solve, funny sidekicks to use, and double cross cards.\n      Todd Sanders has revealed a little bit more about the Campaign mode which is now included in the Expansion box. This is a light legacy variant that links all the 7 cases of the base game and the expansion box.\nHave a look at the not final version HERE\n  PLAY\n\n      You might want to read an extensive review of the game from Jambalayaplaysgame, CLICK HERE\n  For more details on the components and rules of Pulp Detective, download the rule book HERE, and the Double cross & Masterminds expansion HERE (right click and Save as).\nPlease download these files, as PDFs viewed in-browser may not display properly. These files are the low-resolution version of the rules documents.\nYou, as a resourceful Detective, have a special ability that you can use whenever you need it:\nAt the beginning of each round, you lose an hour and mark it on the case card. You must spend your time wisely because when the day is over, you have lost the game! \nWhen drawing your three Storyline cards, choosing to keep is important in advancing the investigation. If you want to get a new item, choose a Follow a Lead card. Items are great because they improve your chances to find clues.\nFor example, hiring the Paperboy will allow you to get more Newspaper icons, and flirting with the Underground will allow you to get more weapons. Drinking a bottle of whiskey may improve your stamina when you have low stamina and you feel frustrated.\nTo get more Stamina, choose a Cliffhanger card. Stamina is crucial to your success in the game. The higher your Stamina is, the more dice you will roll during the Investigation phase.\nIf you ever run out of stamina, you immediately lose the game.\nThe game allows for 3 levels of difficulty, and determines how much Stamina you start with.\nTo find more clues, choose an Informant card. Finding clues is the goal of the game.\nRoll the dice and try to find matching icons: If you fail, you will lose one hour and you will be closer and closer to the end of the game, faster than expected.\nChoosing which cards to play adjacent to others will help you with the plot twists that can occur.\n4 Spatial Icons at the 4 edges\n    You can choose from 4 Detectives and 4 Police Inspectors in the base game, each with a different special action that affects game play.\nWhile there is only one Case in the base game it does not have a solution per se but you will come up against 1 of 4 different Criminals once you find the clues you need.\nThe Storyline cards you use in the game never come out the same way twice and this affects game play and the finding of clues.\nIf we add on the Expansion, now you would receive 3 more cases, each with some tweaks, 4 more Detective to choose from and 4 new Mastermind Criminals.\n- The illustrations are stunning. They are real covers of pulp magazines from the 1930s, 40s and 50's. The immersive ambience of the game will make you feel like you are part of a hardboiled movie from the 1940s. You are the detective, trying to unravel the complex case, feeling blue when your stamina is low, while trying to contact your last informant to finally get the one clue that will break this case.\n- The game contains 6 custom embossed dice - 4 Investigation dice, 1 Paperboy die and 1 Underground die. All the dice are unique and sized at a hefty 16 mm.\n- The Storyline phase flows like a movie script. Maybe you will Follow A Lead during your first round, then experience a Cliffhanger on the way to meet your Informant. Then you use one of your Items and call a taxi to hurry to your destination, saving crucial time. And, just like that, at the end of the game you will see a complete film noir story laid out before you. \n- The variants for 2 players allow for both a competitive game and a cooperative game. In the cooperative mode two players work together solve the case, as the Detective and Police Inspector.\nTwist markers\n- Pulp Detective has been in development since 2015. It was a long and captivating process, and is documented by Todd Sanders for his fans. You can read about this HERE .\nDesign notes\n  We'd love for you to try Pulp Detective before you back the campaign! The game has been implemented on Tabletopia, and you can play for free here:\n        If you are a retailer, please contact me at avstudiogames@gmail.com\nThe game is perfectly balanced as it is. Adding more stretch goals is dangerous and increases the production time, making it unpredictable at the end.\nThe box already has all the components required to play the game, and they are the best quality possible. Moreover, more SG multiplies the number of mistakes during the fulfillment process, and they prevent us from perfectly planning the shipping costs of the game. Nobody likes mistakes. \nBut a few more cards, particularly more case cards, would be great to have, and I will ask Todd if we could design more of them to include in the deck!\nLinen options would also be great to add.\nAVStudioGames PLUS represents the games I like, with a strong theme and gorgeous graphics. \nPulp Detective would be the first in the series: They are more accessible than the games I tend to design and usually release under the label AVSG. But we are a single-man company and my games are not distributed by major distributors. I don't use Kickstarter as a pre-order platform; I use Kickstarter to fund my games.\nIf you pledge now, you help me to fund the game, which won't exist without your help.\nTodd Sanders lives in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where he works as a graphic designer, publisher and furniture maker. He has a great renown as a solo board game designer.\nMany of his games have already been published and last year Ludicreations funded a KS campaign for his card game IUNU and They Who Were 8\nOther games should come later this year, as well\u2026 several prototypes graced the tables in Essen in October 2017.\nI have designed and developed several boardgames during the last 8 years such like Tramways, Small City, CliniC, Card City XL, Town Center and many expansions for these games.\nBeing an unconditional fan of Pulp Magazines, I was immediately hooked by Todd's game. The graphics remind me of my collection of books and magazines from this golden age.\nI enjoyed working on this game with Todd, and together we developed the ability to play with 2 players, balanced the gameplay and built on Todd's months of development work to make this great Print & Play game ready for the board game market.\nLike our past campaigns for games such as Tramways, the Tramways expansions, and Card City XL, we have respected the delivery time, and in some case, boxes were even delivered earlier than expected (depending on how complex production of the game has been).\nFor example, for the Card City XL campaign, thanks to very rigorous management of the files, and great contacts at the manufacturers, we managed to deliver the game 2 months early! \nWe expect the game to be ready for December, the embossed dice are the most complex part of the components to produce, and samples of them are mostly ready.\n  Because you are helping me finance my project, I will help you finance your shipping: I will pay part of the cost, so you only have to pay $5 for shipping a game of this size. It is the least I can do. \nThanks to Ludicreations for their help during the campaign.\nLike my Facebook page : https://www.facebook.com/AVStudioGames-800700710043132/\nFollow my projects on Twitter : https://twitter.com/AlbanVIARD?lang=en\nBecome a fan on BoardGameGeek : https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/233149/pulp-detective\n F.A.Q: \nHow can I choose the french version ?\nBack the campaign, you will choose the french version when we send the pledge manager later in the campaign ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAVStudioGames Plus has already put a substantial amount of money into the initial illustration and graphic design. \nWe now need your help to traverse the final route: Producing the game.

Werewolves, Vampires, and other shadowy creatures reach out in the night to tear apart your people. But never fear, new Citizens have joined the fray - some specializing in taking out these dark creatures! \nValeria: Card Kingdoms - Shadowvale brings in a whole new set of Citizens, Monsters, Domains, and Dukes that you can play stand-alone using components from the base game, or mix with card stacks from the base game and previous expansions for all new experiences.\nValeria: Card Kingdoms - Expansion Pack #6: RELICS  \nIn Expansion Pack #6: RELICS, you'll discover a whole new mechanic that will give you a slight edge during certain actions. During setup, shuffle up the Relics and give one to each player. Each Relic has a unique power. During the game, use your Relic to get bonus actions or discounts on performing actions to amplify your progress in the game.  \nThe Relic expansion pack will NOT be available through retail. It will be available at conventions and possibly at the BGG Store. \nWe have several Relic cards planned as Stretch Goals. So, the more money we raise, the more limited exclusive content you will receive as our thank you to all of our backers.\nGame Setup with New Content\n  Valeria: Card Kingdoms is a fast-paced card and dice game that will have you and your friends slaying monsters, recruiting citizens, and expanding your domain.\nIn Valeria: Card Kingdoms, 1 to 5 players compete to build the greatest kingdoms in about 30-45 minutes.\nMonster Card Anatomy\nDark monsters have risen to terrorize the kingdom of Valeria. Use Strength to slay minions like pesky Dire Rats... and titans like the mighty Darkstalker... to earn rewards. Then, defeat the boss in each area to clear the land and earn rewards based on the amount of monsters you've killed in that area.\nCitizen Card Anatomy\nPlayers start with 1 Peasant and 1 Knight. Throughout the game you and your friends will use Gold to recruit a tableau of loyal citizens like the hard-working Lumberjack... the blessed Exorcist... or the Hunter. In a single game, there are 10 different citizens to choose from, and with the Shadowvale expansion, you'll have a total of 32 alternate citizen types to create nearly endless combinations and challenges. No two games will be alike.\nDomain Card Anatomy\nOnce you've recruited the right combination of citizens, you can buy powerful domains like Karloff Castle - that gives you strength equal to the size of your army, or King Tower - that lets you give another player magic to gain a Victory Point. \nDuke Card Anatomy\nEach player drafts a Duke or Duchess card at the start of the game, giving you secret ways to score bonus Victory Points. Follow the wishes of your patron and you may find yourself basking in the glory of victory.\nRelic Card Anatomy\nWith the new KS Limited Exclusive expansion pack, RELICS, you'll also draft a powerful Relic that will give you a small advantage performing certain actions in the game.\n  35 New Monster Cards in 5 New Monster Stacks\n  60 New Citizen Cards (10 Stacks Of 6 Cards Each)\n  20 New Domain Cards\nAll of the content above will be in the retail version of Valeria: Card Kingdoms - Shadowvale along with all necessary divider cards to merge everything into your original Valeria: Card Kingdoms box.\nUNLOCKED!\nWe've unlocked the following content thanks to all of our backers: \n5 Domain Cards - Martin Road, Opera House, Laborium, Legendre's Keep, Ancient Tomb\n2 Event Cards - Good Omen, Blessed Lands\n12 Citizen Cards - Alt. Knight, Alt Peasant\nWe also decided to include a Warden for the Undead Samurai monster stack! \nThe Missing Warden Now Included!\n  10 Relic Cards\nFor backers, the RELICS expansion pack will be included inside of your box of Valeria: Card Kingdoms - Shadowvale. The expansion pack will include a divider card. The RELICS expansion pack will NOT be available at retail, but will be available at conventions or the BGG store.\nUNLOCKED!  \nWe've unlocked the following content thanks to all of our backers:\n5 Relic Cards - St.Aquila's Statue, Staff of Urdr, Dragon Orb, Philosopher's Tome, Lich Sword.\nValeria: Card Kingdoms and all expansions are in world wide distribution. Please ask your local FLGS to order them for you. That being said, we do have some stuff that won't be available at retail (unless those Retailers are backers). \nAdd an additional $20 to receive the Big Box.\nDepending on which printing of Valeria: Card Kingdoms your copy is from and, and how many of our previous expansions and expansion packs you have, and whether or not you sleeve your cards, it is quite possible that the cards from Shadowvale will not fit inside your original Valeria box. Also, we're not done expanding Valeria: Card Kingdoms and you can look forward to more added content in the future.\nPlease read the FAQ to determine your card storage needs.\nIf you are running out of space, we're making a Big Box that will hold more and giving you a set of dice and an enamel coin to replace the boring First Player token. We've updated the plastic insert inside to hold more and the Mico will be working on a unique piece of art for the cover. \nValeria: Card Kingdoms comes with lots of wooden tokens and multiplier chits to use if you run out, but some folks want all their resource tokens to be wood, so we are offering an add-on pack of 140 additional wood tokens.\nAdd an additional $12 to receive more tokens.\nAdding extra tokens might affect the storage capacity of your original box, so you might also want to consider the Big Box add-on.\nThe original version of the Playmat is sold out. We've decided to make a new bigger version that takes into consideration the Agents expansion pack. The artwork is in progress and will be based on the Big Box image. We're leaning towards just a huge white dragon. \nAdd an additional $25 to receive the new playmat.\n                                                     Dice Tower Approved!\n                                                  Click to try out the Shadowvale cards on Tabletop Simulator!\n                                                                                                                                            Once again, Schwerkraft-Verlag, Pixie Games, and Crazy Pawn Games will be joining us on this print run! You can back here for those languages and they will be delivered to you by them in your language (to certain countries).\nSchwerkraft-Verlag - Germany and Austria.\nPixie Games - France and Belgium.\nCrazy Pawn Games - Spain.\n          Rewards will be customs and VAT friendly for all of the major shipping regions: US, CA, EU, UK, and AU. If you're just getting the English Shadowvale expansion, your rewards will ship directly from China. If you're getting Shadowvale in any other language, or if you are adding on the Big Box, your rewards will ship from a regional hub or from that language's production partner.\nWe like to support game stores around the world by offering the Kickstarter versions of the game to retailers during the campaign. We treat retailer backers just like other backers in that they receive their rewards before we release regular retail games into distribution.  \nWe ask that you commit to at least 1 case (12 games), but we only ask you for $1 until we are ready to ship out the games to backers. At that point, we will invoice you for $149 (wholesale price) and you will receive a discount on shipping. If you would like to be included, we ask that you back the campaign for $1 and email David at david@dailymagicgames.com. We will ship only to stores in the US, or to foreign stores with a freight forwarder with a US address.\nEvery game we create is a discrete project with its own development schedule, its own budget for production and marketing expenses, and it's own timeline for funding, production, and delivery. We bring each project to Kickstarter to give you, our fans and supporters, the opportunity to help us put the final touches on the game and to reserve your copies at the time when it will do the game the most good, both financially and creatively.  \nSome say that a creator should not launch a new project until their previous project is completed and delivered. That system might work for a designer who is self-publishing a game, but for an up-and-coming company like Daily Magic Games, that system is not viable. At any point in time we are working on a dozen projects in various stages of completion. Right now, for example...  \nFood Truck Champion shipped to all backers and will be in retail in February. \nSailing Toward Osiris is in final assembly and we expect to deliver it to backers 1 month late, in March 2018. Sailing Toward Osiris will be produced in English, German, French, and Spanish. Sailing Toward Osiris will debut at Origins 2018 and be released to retailers in June 2018. Available for pre-order.\nCrabs! is at the printer and we expect to deliver Crabs! to backers in March 2018 and to be on retail store shelves by July 2018. Available for pre-order.\nHorizons is at the printer and we expect Horizons to be delivered to backers in July 2018, debut at GenCon 2018, and hit retail stores in August 2018. Available for pre-order.\nSarah\u2019s Singularity did not fund on Kickstarter and is back into redevelopment. \nAlchemea, by Ian Stedman and illustrated by Claire Donaldson, is a reimagining of Ian's game, Magnum Opus. It is in beta testing.  \nCorsairs: A Valeria Adventure, by Wouter van Strien and Isaias Vallejo, illustrated by The Mico, was inspired by Wouter's game Wacky Pirates. During development, Corsairs evolved into a more strategic game than the original and is in beta testing.  \nSpaceways, by Philip duBarry and illustrated by The Mico, is a sci-fi pick-up and deliver / area control game set in the Horizons universe. This stand-alone sequel is in beta testing.  \nChocolatiers, by Isaias Vallejo and illustrated by Claire Donaldson, is a gateway game where players take on the role of chocolatiers boxing chocolates in crowd-pleasing arrangements. It is in beta testing and you can download the PNP at BoardGameGeek.  \nThieve's Den, by Alice Davis and illustrated by Denis Martynets, is a unique blend of card drafting and worker placement set in the world of 10 Minute Heist. It is in beta testing.  \nWe're hoping that our track record for successfully completing and delivering previous projects will give you the confidence to support Shadowvale, and that the forthright communications we present when projects do hit snags will assuage any fears that we're going to screw it all up. By the way, if you'd like to help us with any of our alpha or beta testing, please send us an email at contact[at]dailymagicgames[dot]com.\nDaily Magic Games is a designer-friendly and customer-focused publisher specializing in casual tabletop games that are easy to learn and play, yet layered with strategy and depth.  \nIsaias Vallejo, Wizard-in-Chief, Game Designer, and Developer  \nDavid MacKenzie, Conjurer and Game Developer  \nLevi Mote, Alchemist, Game Designer, and Developer  \nSarah Sharp, Enchantress and Convention Event Planner  \nDylan Pharaoh-Whitney, Sorcerer and Graphic Designer  \nWe are focused on listening to what our customers have to say and making sure that we are producing the type of games you want at the high quality you demand. We are actively involved in the Comments section of each Kickstarter and keep backers up to date with plenty of updates post-Kickstarter. We like to make casual and gateway games in an effort to get more people to the table. Our games are easy to learn to help new players get in to the game faster, but they're also layered with strategy for the more seasoned players. We're based out of Seattle, Washington and like to focus on the growth and promotion of game design in the Pacific Northwest. We've even started a playtesting event network called playtestNW to help local designers meet each other and engage with playtesters on a regular basis. Our hope is that we're helping designers build better games.\n  ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nDaily Magic Games is committed to delivering quality products on time. We realize that the publication of a board game can be complicated and, no matter how experienced the project creators and mangers are, some problems may occur. In an effort to reduce the likelihood of delays and mistakes, we have taken several steps to prepare for success:\n\n1. This game project, as well as the Kickstarter campaign itself, are in the hands of two well-seasoned professionals. David MacKenzie has been running Kickstarter projects since 2010 (Alien Frontiers, Sunrise City, King's Forge, Swinging Jivecat Voodoo Lounge, Valeria: Card Kingdoms, ManaSurge, Villages of Valeria, Quests of Valeria, Merchants of Araby, Go Nuts For Donuts, 10 Minute Heist), and Isaias Vallejo comes from a digital games background as production and studio director at Big Fish Games and has designed several successful board games: Sunrise City, Valeria: Card Kingdoms, Villages of Valeria, and Quests of Valeria.\n\n2. We are dedicated to backer communication and feedback. Throughout every campaign, we are as transparent about the process and as open to feedback as possible without jeopardizing production and delivery timelines.\n\n3. We have done significant pre-production. All the art and graphic design files for Shadowvale are completed with the exception of the stretch goals content. The art and design for the stretch goals content has been sketched out and is ready to push forward as soon as each goal is achieved.\n\n4. We have our manufacturer lined up and ready to begin the pre-press process as soon as the the files are delived. We hope that everything goes as planned, but if something falls through the cracks, we are ready and willing to employ every tool at our disposal to get the project back on track and running smoothly.\n\nThank you for your support!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 12 or more", "title": "Premium PNP Files", "descp": "Full-art, full-res, full-color Premium Print 'N Play PDF files.\nINCLUDES:\nPNP Valeria: Card Kingdoms\nPNP Flames & Frost\nPNP Shadowvale\nPNP Exp.

Hunt", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "The holy knight you have already come to know as a protector of the gamer realm, an example of nobility, strength and inhuman endurance: is back! We are proud to present Paladin Card Protection Season 2!\n21 sizes of sleeves to fit your gaming needs (all with free shipping) make a glorious return to protect your cards from wear and tear - now with a new type of sleeves joining the proud roster. Please welcome the new Percival: double matte coloured back sleeves!\n    All our sleeves are available by default as clear gloss. All Double Matte sleeves (both with coloured backs and clear) require pledging +$1 per packet. For more information, check the Pledge Levels section of the campaign. \n Here are some great reasons why you should choose Paladin Card Protection as your brand of sleeves:\n1. Our protectors are extremely durable. With a thickness of 90 microns, our sleeves will prevail in the harshest gaming conditions, while still keeping the combined height of sleeved decks reasonable.\n2. Paladin Card Protectors are clear, safe to use (no PVC!), and they come in packs of 55, because we know you will need more than 50 with each packet! That is like going to 11 only five times better.\n3. We are gamers, and we listen to gamers (that means you!). Last time around we introduced sleeves you wanted us to include, and this time we're doing the same. That is why the new double matte coloured back ccg sleeves are here!\nChoosing the Paladin as your personal card protector also means, that you will pay no shipping fee. Let us say this again: shipping is free wherever you live!\nPaladin Card Protection is made by people who play games and make games. That gives us a unique perspective, and combined with our sleeve production experience, that allowed us to set a new industry standard for sleeve packs! \nCards for most modern board games are printed on sheets of 110 cards each (which can be easily divided into two 55-card decks). This is why so many designer board games come with a number of cards that is a multiple of 55 \u2013 and this is also the reason why Paladin Card Protectors also come in packs of 55.\nIf your gaming collection spans over multiple card games, we know you buy card sleeves in bulk. With Paladin Card Protectors, you will always have what you need to sleeve the odd 5 cards left out by other sleeve manufacturers!\nPaladin Card Protectors come in 17 different sizes! Just take a look at some of the games you'll be able to sleeve!\nAnd here's a more comprehensive list of what you'll be able to protect with just the 5 most popular sizes of our sleeves!\nIf you are looking for an even more comprehensive list, just check out this extensive geeklist! Paladin Card Protectors are listed there as NSKN Sleeves. Just remember that the geeklist is created and moderated by BGG users, and not by Paladin staff!\nPledge now, make choices later! You will be able to fully customize your pledge, and choose each sleeve pack individually! Just make sure to look at the special large sleeve rules below!\nThe numbers above are given for regular sizes of clear sleeves. Please add $1 for each pack of Double Matte sleeves you choose. For the larger sizes (Ragnelle, Bors, Lamorac and Gaheris), please add $1 per pack chosen. Dedicated KDM sleeves (Mordred and Morholt), as well as the Morgana sleeves are available as add-ons. Please note that you will be able to make all final choices (and raise your pledge) in the pledge manager after the campaign.\nAre you looking for dedicated KDM sleeves? You can get them as add-ons! To receive them, add their cost to your pledge now, and you'll be able to get them in the pledge manager after the campaign.\n      Do you know how much the Paladin can endure, and still offer your cards full protection? Here are a few durability tests we did last time around:\n    Would you like to see more horrible things done to Paladin Card Protectors? Tell us in the comments, and we just might film what you wished to see!\nHow about an ultimate test? See Tom Vasel's daughters try to do as much damage as possible in a game specifically designed to test the durability of Paladin Card Protection:\nIf you want to play the game yourself, you can prepare your own copy using the below print and play (just click on the image to get the file). Now you can test any sleeves while having silly fun with friends!\n    Paladin Card Protectors will be manufactured in China by one of the leading companies making card sleeves - one that has proven capable of manufacturing the highest quality product, as evidenced by our happy fans and backers around the globe. \nJust as before, production will take place under our direct supervision, following all the quality standards we promise to abide by in this campaign. As always, when we manufacture overseas, we will be present on site for quality check and final delivery of the sleeves.  \nAfter the end of this campaign, we will open a pledge manager, where you will be able to complete your order by choosing the sizes of Paladin Card Protectors you need and desire.  \nWe estimate the production to conclude in late march 2018, which will allow us to get sleeves into your hands between July and September 2018, perhaps a little earlier in Europe. \n  Paladin Card Protection was created by a team of passionate gamers and game design and publishing specialists, working (and playing games together!) for NSKN Games and Strawberry Studio. As gamers, we wanted to create the perfect type of sleeve: offering high level of protection, while having an as small as possible influence on your gaming experience.\nThe Paladin Card Protectors are 90 microns thick. This means, that they are thicker than most of the popular brands\u2019 Premium sleeves. We offer extremely high durability, and a level of protection that keeps your cards away from harm in any gaming situation.  \nWe chose the thickness of 90 microns to maximize binding, making Paladin Card protectors almost unbreakable, while your cards stay well protected, for an affordable price.  \nAre there thicker sleeves on the market? Yes. You can buy sleeves that are 100, 106 or even 125 microns thick. However, we elected to pick the perfect compromise between protection and influencing your gaming experience. 90 microns already offer perfectly solid protection, while still making a sleeved deck manageable. Simply put, with thicker sleeves the decks spill over your gaming table much too easily to be used comfortably.   \nFinally, we wanted sleeves that are clear and safe to use. No PVC or acid is an industry standard which we adhere to. We have personally made sure that the materials used guarantee the highest level of clarity, so that you can enjoy the cards you choose to protect the way they you want to enjoy them: in full, vivid and unmodified colour and sharpness.\n   ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nPaladin Card Protection is a new project of a team of specialists experienced in the fields of manufacturing tabletop gaming materials and worldwide shipping.\n\nWith 11 highly successful board game Kickstarter Projects under the NSKN Games brand, including the previous Paladin Card Protection project, we have the knowledge and experience to deliver the highest quality product in a timely manner.\n\nTo ensure the highest quality of our product and a smooth delivery, we have personally visited the production facilities in China (with more details coming up in the updates), which allows us to realistically assess the time and effort needed to manufacture and deliver Paladin Card Protectors to our backers.\n\nOur first campaign for Paladin Card Protectores experienced delays in delivery for our North American and Australian backers due to circumstances beyond our control. That being said, we have also learned a lot about sleeves manufacturing and also about logistics of such large projects. Thus, for this second campaign, we have a plan in place to avoid such delays: we will agree with the production plan on all sizes before the project ends, thus saving time in getting the corrected samples; we are going to place our final order 40 days after the project ends, shortening the time the pledge manager stays open; contracting ahead of time a company to pick and pack individual backer rewards; setting up a contract with DHL for overseas shipping, thus replacing FedEx logistics - the forwarder with whom we experienced significant delays for our last two projects.\n\nKnowing that the unexpected may still happen, we are accounting for possible delays at every step of production and fulfillment, and working only with partners that have not failed us in the past, making sure that if something does no go exactly as planned, we will have enough spare time to still stay within the project deadlines.\n\nWe will continue to communicate openly and sincerely with you - our backers - whether the projects moves along according to the plan or if anything unexpected happens. Our aim is to deliver the best possible products in a timely manner, but more than that, it is our goal to make Paladin season to an enjoyable journey for everyone on board.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 38 or more", "title": "20-Pack", "descp": "20 packs of Paladin Card Protectors, 55 cards each.

Also, Kayenta Games is announcing Flat Shipping Fees for 95% of the current pledged geographies (see the Shipping section below).\nThe Story\nVictorian England, 1840. You are the head of a respected but financially troubled family estate; rooms are closed off to save on upkeep and heating, outside grounds have gone to seed, and the fa\u00e7ade is in desperate need of restoration.\nIt is far from the glory days of the estate, but you have new hope. A significant inheritance has made possible the restoration of the grand old manor house and rehabilitation of the family's reputation in the county of Cambridge.\nObsession captures the experience of Regency and Victorian England\u2014the beloved world of Jane Austen & Anthony Trollope\u2014in a way that transports family and friends to that unique time and place.\nLast things first: How's the gameplay?\n\"More than anything else, what really sets this game apart, what really makes it shine, is just how strongly integrated the theme is. It\u2019s rare to see a Euro-style economic simulation where the theme comes alive as much as this one.\" \u2014Richard Ham, Rahdo Runs Through\nFinal thoughts from Rahdo:\nNote: Components used in the Rahdo Runs Through review and the Rulebook PDF are prototypes.\nGame Quality and Mechanics\nGame Quality: The mission of Kayenta Games is to fuse deep strategy (leaning towards Euro-style games), exceptional component quality, and elegant aesthetics. The prototype used in Rahdo's runthrough will be improved on all fronts. Obsession has been pre-qualified with Panda Games, and the base game will be manufactured as follows:\nMatte + Linen Box Finish\n2mm High Density Mounted Cardboard for Player Boards, Game Board, and Tiles, all with Matte + Linen Finish\n300gsm Ivorycore Linen Embossed Card Stock for all Cards\nForty-Six Wooden Pawns\nLinen Draw Bag (for Tiles)\nStretch Goals provide a very reasonable opportunity for the following upgrades:\nVacuum Molded Component Tray \n310gsm Blackcore Card Stock, Linen Embossed\nGame Mechanics: Obsession integrates and modifies several game mechanics to create a unique approach to accumulating victory points. There is Deck building of desirable English aristocracy, acquisition of country estate renovation tiles that define future actions, servant worker placement that enables favors associated with these actions, an ongoing courtship featuring in-game victory point competitions, and an accelerating accumulation of reputation (triangular number sequence). All combine to enable multiple paths to victory. Players can choose effective strategies focused on:\nMaximizing the family's reputation (Reputation VP below)\nExpanding the family's circle of acquaintances with a focus on prestigious guests (Gentry VP)\nIntensive renovation of the country estate (Improvement VP)\nFulfilling demanding secret objectives (Objective Card VP)\nExpanding and training the family's staff of servants (Servant VP)\nSecuring the hand of the Fairchild love interest (Courtship VP)\nSources of Victory Points (data from 36 games)\n\"There\u2019s a lot going on, a lot of plates you have to keep spinning; lots of short-term bird-in-the-hand vs. two-in-the-long-term-bush optimization choices to make. Different things you can focus on: points for upgrading your estate, for getting more servants, for having more money, for getting more famous, for building monuments, for having only the best guests to your house. There\u2019s so many things you can do, and the game really does build as the game goes on\u2026you can put on massive events with huge attendees and you can score tons of resources that will just propel you forward. And, at the heart of all of it is that there's always this competition for the heart of the young, heartbroken Fairchild.\" \u2014Richard Ham, Rahdo Runs Through\nStretch Goal Overview\nSpecific detail for each stretch goal can be found down the page under Stretch Goals.\n\nMajor Components\nThe Player Board representing your family is the location where servants reside, reputation is tracked, pounds are saved, and activities take place (one of the four player boards shown).\nNew Player Board, Family Ponsonby\nImprovement and Monument Tiles are the heart of Obsession gameplay. These renovations and capital improvements of the family's country estate become the setting where you can accomplish four vital strategic tasks:\nRaise pounds (\u00a3) for future capital improvements\nGather guests for activities that lead to invitations being extended to new guests\nIncrease the family\u2019s reputation among the local landed gentry with displays of elegance and style\nTrain the service staff to be more proficient at a host of actions, including service above and beyond the call, combating and spreading gossip, and gathering key intelligence.\nImprovement Tiles come in four standard categories\u2014Prestige, Estate, Essentials, and Sporting\u2014each of which produces specialized favors. \nImprovement (Renovation) Tiles (where activities are hosted)\n  Rounding Out a Side against the Locals\nInvestments in the Service infrastructure empower the servants on staff, making them more efficient...and more effective at gathering inside information on the maneuverings of competing families.\nService Tiles (upgrades abilities of service staff)\n  A Close-Up Peek at the Expansion Service Tile, the Barn\nMonuments represent substantial capital investment in elegant accents in and around the estate, a sure sign of a family on the rise in society.\nMonument Tiles (prestigious capital improvements)\n  The Most Valuable Tile in the Game\nGentry cards represent both your family and the guests who will attend activities at your manor house. Wealthy, well-connected, and reputable guests visiting your estate open up opportunities for financial investment, expand your circle of prestigious acquaintances, and elevate your status in the county. \nThe Ponsonby Family\nYou quickly learn, however, that some guests must be avoided! Beware of unsavory characters passing themselves off as gentlemen and ladies; show pity on the impoverished without familiarity; and at all costs, let other families stoop to the company of an American!\n  An American Heiress, a Cad, an Adventuress, and a Pauper\n  Beware the American Heiress\nCultivate proper connections of the sort that do not endanger the family's good name.\nThe Influential Social Elite\nThe obsession of the five families in the county of Cambridge are the Fairchild twins, Charles and Elizabeth.\nThe Love Interests\nFaithful servants are the hidden magic in Obsession. Without a large, competent, and well-trained service staff, you are doomed to defeat! Proper service topped this list of priorities for the landed gentry during the Victorian era, and this remains true in Obsession.\nUnderbutler, Footmen, Housekeeper, Butler, Valets, and Lady's Maids\nCourtship\nRomance and marriage\u2014not necessarily in that order\u2014were a focal point of the Victorian idle rich. Forming alliances with respected families, avoiding public impropriety, marrying up where possible, and securing the future of eligible children were all part of an elaborate drama that served as the backdrop for daily life. The arrival of Charles and Elizabeth Fairchild\u2014eligible, refined, and exceedingly wealthy\u2014into a relatively modest corner of the county of Cambridgeshire has stirred the interest of every eager young man and lady in the area! Players will compete for the hand of Charles or Elizabeth, often relying on manipulation, gossip, and intrigue as much as amore!\nIn Obsession, the calculated Courtships of the era are followed closely on a two-sided Turn Track that features standard and extended play.\nTurn Track (two-sided - Standard and Event-Based)\nSolitaire\nThe central gameplay mechanic in Obsession is the hosting of events, which is an action that largely takes place independent of one\u2019s competitors. As a result, Obsession naturally lends itself to solitary play. Competition in the Builders' Market and for the hand of the love interest during Courtship represent the significant areas of interaction, which are managed with Solitaire opponent cards. There are twelve cards that come with the base game; four opponents at each level of expertise: Expert, Intermediate, and Beginner. \nSolitaire Opponents\u2014Old English Families\n  Includes one copy of the Obsession base game (all elements described above) along with all unlocked stretch goals as part of this campaign.\n\nThe Pax Britannica Reward Level features a complete game of Obsession, including all unlocked stretch goals. Please note the box contents reflect prototype art:\n  Includes the Pax Britannica reward detailed above, plus the Wessex Expansion.\nThe Queen Victoria Reward Level features a complete game of Obsession, a copy of the Wessex Expansion, and all unlocked stretch goals.\nThe base game comes with four family boards\u2014Asquith, Cavendish, Ponsonby, and York\u2014each of which confer a competitive advantage.\nThe Wessex Expansion adds a fifth family board to the mix that gives the advantage of a larger starting country estate. A player selecting the Family Wessex player board will have their choice between the Breakfast Room and Tennis Court\u2014second level improvements\u2014in his or her manor house at the beginning of the game.\nNote that this is not an expansion for enabling five players.\nThis expansion also includes:\nColor-coded reputation marker for Family Wessex\nOne additional Breakfast Room and Tennis Court (the Wessex family advantage)\nFive additional Starter Guests\nFive additional Casual Guests\nFive additional Prestige Guests\nSix new Solitaire opponents\nInstruction sheet for Family Wessex\nNew Player Board, Wessex Family\n  The Wessex Family\n  This reward level is equal to 2 Pax Britannica rewards.\nShipping can be expensive for modern tabletop board games with all the various components. Obsession weighs almost 5 pounds and features 300 high quality components. The Anthony Trollope reward level offers an 4.5% discount for two games and freezes shipping at the cost of one game. Great for friends to collaborate and save on shipping!\nThis reward level is equal to 2 Queen Victoria reward levels.\nThe Jane Austen reward level offers a 6.8% discount for two games with the Wessex Expansion and freezes shipping at the cost of one Queen Victoria package.

When a guest stays there, they are so enamoured of the family's hospitality that the player may double some or all of the favors. Only one guest is invited to this \u201cActivity,\u201d which makes it very powerful for a late game turn after a player has just exhausted his or her staff with a Grand Ball or Formal Affair. Then, when the tile is flipped, it becomes a Monument, which confers reputation each turn until the end of the game (for the top two rooms).\nShipping\nShipping costs are not included in your pledge.

Hunt", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "WE NOW HAVE STRETCH GOALS! \nSo, if you've already read the basic information on the project...\nScan down to the bottom to find great new rewards and our goals!\n\nThose of you who are already readers of the Caine Riordan universe pretty much know what to expect from these stories: gritty yet doggedly optimistic hard sf in a world that is a believable and embattled successor to our own. But for those who are not familiar with the series' hallmark blend of exploration, alien encounters, intrigue, and action, then . . . \n Welcome to the 22nd century where humanity has just reached out to the stars and now finds itself challenged by contact by five (or is that four?) very different (yet very realistic) alien species whose motivations are as unusual and arresting as their physical forms. Of course, planet Earth still has plenty of problems, injustice, and inequities of its own to deal with.\n    The novels of the Terran Republic series are a deep dive into the high-stakes exploration, statecraft, and warfare--both with other species and among ourselves--that churn and change our post-contact world. The title character--Caine Riordan--is part of a diverse cohort that has been tasked with juggling these rapidly shifting challenges, often at odds with their superiors as they bring fresh solutions to these novel situations. \nHowever, no world is defined by a mere handful of experts and heroes. Rather, just as our own world is full of different people and perspectives, Lost Signals expands the universe of the Terran Republic by bringing together new voices and new stories in a unique format that intentionally blurs the line between fact and fiction. \nThe first part of Lost Signals is faux reportage: wire copy, features, and brief articles from the world of 2122 AD. But just as there is always the truth behind the news, the stories in the anthology then reveal what was really going on behind those sanitized accounts of Earth's most desperate hours. \nThe untold stories revealed in Lost Signals include: \n Delta Parvonis Three is home to primitive aliens, 20,000-year-old mosaics, and quasi-Greek ruins. Will a cultural archaeologist's work strengthen the link between Earth and this distant planet, or spark a destructive panic among her fellow humans?   \n The crew of a lone frigate, having drawn the tedious job of picketing a nowhere system--just a way-point between here and there--laments the lack of action. Until an enemy shift carrier brings the war to them. \n When Indonesia\u2019s corporate clone-soldiers are ordered to slaughter civilians, many of them resist--and rediscover an ancient truth: every slave rebellion gives rise to a Spartacus. \n When N\u2019Erkversh, First Voice of the First Family, realizes that his invasion of Earth is crumbling, he does the only thing a noble Hkh\u2019Rkh can do: fight to the death. But there are others, eager for him to live, who fight to ensure his safety.\n \"Follow the money\" takes on a whole new meaning for reporter Della Monroe when she decides to track down thirty-six missing Space Fleet sailors and Marines.\n On a contested world of scant resources, the Arat Kur stumble upon a gift to offer humanity, even though it may permanently upset the balance of power in the Accord. But only if humanity can cooperate in turn.\nIn addition to the powerful narrative pull of these stories, there are also special rewards to encourage you to join the project right away. The first 100 pledges will receive a short novel by Alex Shvartsman--H.G. Wells: Secret Agent--and a Nebula-nominated novella by Lawrence M. Schoen, \"Barry's Tale\" in electronic format. And all pledges for rewards of $100 or greater will get the ebook of Alex's laugh-out-loud collection, Explaining Cthulhu to Grandma. Just our way of saying thanks for your enthusiasm and help in bringing this anthology's lost signals to light.\n\n  So, a final logical question might be, \"Yeah, but will it be any good?\"\nWell, if you trust best-seller lists and awards, this might help you make a decision:\nevery novel in the Caine Riordan series has been a National Bestseller\nthe first three novels were Nebula finalists (fourth novel is TBD)\nthe last two novels were Dragon Award finalists\nand the first novel won the Compton Crook Award\n--but if you make most of your reading decisions based more on word of mouth, then here's what some authors and reviewers have said about the Caine Riordan series:\n\"Fire with Fire and Trial by Fire blend ruthless political pragmatism, advanced aliens with subtle and dangerous agendas, and human courage, determination, and sacrifice into an action-filled story that keeps readers up late.Very late, in my case. You should already have Chuck Gannon on your shelves. If you don\u2019t have him there, rectify your oversight immediately!\"--David Weber   \n\"Chuck Gannon writes the kind of science fiction we all grew up on: rousing, mind-expanding, pulse-pounding sagas of spaceships and aliens. He's a terrific writer, and we're lucky to have him.\" -- Robert J. Sawyer\n\"If we meet strong aliens out there, will we suffer the fate of the Aztecs and Incas, or find the agility to survive? Gannon fizzes with ideas about the dangerous politics of first contact.\u201d\u2014--David Brin\n\u201cI seriously enjoyed Trial by Fire. This one\u2019s a tidal wave\u2014can\u2019t put it down. An excellent book.\u201d \u2014Jack McDevitt \n\"The plot (of Fire With Fire) is intriguing and then some. Well-developed and self-consistent; intelligent readers are going to like it.\"\u2014Jerry Pournelle\n\"Gannon's whiz-bang second Tales of the Terran Republic interstellar adventure delivers on the promise of the first (Fire with Fire) . . . The charm of Caine's harrowing adventure lies in Gannon's attention to detail. ...The dozens of key characters, multiple theaters of operations, and various alien cultures all receive the appropriate amount of attention. The satisfying resolution is enhanced by the promise of more excitement to come in this fascinating far-future universe.\"\u2014Publishers Weekly Starred Review   \n\" . . . definitely one to appeal to the adventure fans. Riordan is a smart hero, up against enormous obstacles and surrounded by enemies. Author Gannon does a good job of managing action and tension to keep the story moving, and the details of the worlds Riordan visits are interesting in their own right.\"\u2014Analog\n\"Raising Caine unveils a lot of thought-provoking ideas but ultimately this is a space opera adventure. There are space battles, daring emergency landings, desperate quests, hand-to-hand combat, and double-and-triple crosses. It\u2019s an engrossing read, . . . an intergalactic thrill-ride.\"\u2014Fantasy and Science Ficton Book and Audiobook Reviews\n\"Raising Caine is an incredibly active book . . .  a whole mess of fun, globes-trotting around a universe. Some of the action is of the more cerebral kind, as our protagonists are confronted by the beautiful, terrible, and sometimes lethal variety of the universe and its inhabitants. . . . Gannon\u2019s attention to detail as he constructs his exosapients is superb.\" --Barnes and Noble\n\"This is science-fiction adventure on a grand scale.\"\u2014Kirkus\n\"Military sf fans should love this series that combines intense action and ell-plotted tactical engagements. . . .  Suggest to fans of . . . military sf writers like David Weber and John Ringo, or those who enjoy Jack Campbell\u2019s \u201cLost Fleet\u201d series.\"--Library Journal\n\"One of the best ways I can sum up my thoughts on this . . . supremely readable and ultimately fun novel is this: if someone were to ask me to recommend a novel that exemplifies what I enjoy most in SF . . .  I\u2019d eagerly put Fire with Fire into that person\u2019s hands.\"--SFF World\nLatest book: Caine's Mutiny (#4)\n  Another very cool feature of this campaign\nYour participation in the creation of this project can go far beyond giving your support to this project: you can give you own NAME to either persons or locations in the Caine Riordan universe. Two of our award categories--Playing a Role and Playing God--allow you to name characters or planets, respectively, and will carry forward as the series progresses. We're excited to be in the rare position of being able to offer these two classes of awards and hope you will therefore literally leave your own personal mark upon the Caine Riordan universe. (One request: if you choose a major character, and there's already one in the series with that first name, please have an alternate/nickname in mind.)\nSTRETCH GOALS AND GREAT NEW REWARDS!\nThanks to our first 180 supporters, we met our funding goal of $7500 in only 55 hours. But that was only the beginning. We don't want to give you an average anthology: we want to give you a thick volume with more great authors and more great stories. Or maybe two volumes!\nTo that end, we were always ready with these stretch goals:\nIf funding increases to $10,000, we will be able to add another 20,000 words, bringing the paid author contributions to about 100K. (My stories are free.)\nIf funding increases to $12,000, we will be able to add yet another 20,000 paid words to the book, and everyone who has pledged will get a free e-novel by the outstanding Jean-Marie Ward, With Nine You Get Vanyr.\nAt $16,000 total funding, we will instead produce two volumes of 80K+ words each (not counting my stories). EVERYONE who pledged $10 or more will get the ebook of Lost Signals Volume Two for free. And everyone whose total pledge amount comes to $60 or more, gets the paperback of Volume Two for free.  (Volume Two will be released from six months to about a year after Volume One.)\nI won't go into the details of the great new rewards that will help us to reach that goal, but a quick list includes:\nThe opportunity to dedicate the book to the person of your choice, with a personal reflection/message/memoriam of up to 30 words\nNew naming opportunities for a Leading Role (protagonist/antagonist) in one of the stories in Lost Signals Volume One\nA fiction critique by one of our participating authors (you choose which).\nNaming opportunities (including major characters) in the forthcoming Four Horseman series novel by KC Ezell, one of our new contributors--if we hit our first stretch goal.     \nThere's more, of course, but you'll find the full list--and all the details--in the Rewards column to the right. All but KC Ezell's naming opportunities begin with the word NEW!. We'd have done that for KC's rewards, too--but we couldn't fit them in!\nAnd a grateful postscript to acknowledge Laurent Esmiol, Artur Rosa, and George Krallis for the outstanding visualizations they lent to our video!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nInstead of waiting for funding to start, the contributors and stories have already been proposed and outlined. In fact, you'll meet some of those authors, and get a sneak peek at the opening of their stories, over the course of the Kickstarter. So as soon as the goal is met, we move immediately into execution, with the final product being published by Eric Flint's Ring of Fire Press.\n\nFurthermore, we are fortunate to have so many pros interested in coming to play in this sandbox, that if any of our current contributors have to bow out, we have alternates waiting in the wings. So it's pretty hard to foresee a situation where we'd be scrambling to ensure we get enough copy. If we have a problem, its going to be too high a wordcount, rather than too low. But you know the old saying: better a feast than a famine. \n\nLastly, we have already identified and secured solid pricing commitments from our various production experts: cover and interior layout, proofreading, copy editing. So if we are fully funded, then we are fully budgeted and can go straight to work.\n\nI guess I could always get hit by a bus...but even then, I am empowering the folks in the project to carry on in an editorial capacity (either singly or collectively) to bring you Lost Signals. So when I say that I've thought of every contingency, I don't think I'm exaggerating much...if at all.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "An e-book of Lost Signals", "descp": "The ebook of Lost Signals in EPUB, MOBI and PDF formats", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2018"}], "stat": ["110 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 20 or more", "title": "A paper copy of Lost signals", "descp": "One copy of the physical book, and we throw in the e-book for free!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["113 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 50 or more", "title": "The Interdimensional Duo", "descp": "In addition to a paper copy of Lost Signals, you get a copy of the Wall-Street Bestseller in the Ring of Fire series,\"1635: The Papal Stakes,\" signed by both Eric Flint and Chuck Gannon.\nAnd we throw in the e-book of Lost Signals for free!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["14 backers", "Limited (1 left of 15)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 70 or more", "title": "Up-to-date Interdimensional Duo", "descp": "The best of the Chuck and Eric combinations!

Hunt", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "\"R\u00fcdiger Dorn (Istanbul, Karuba) makes incredibly smart and solid games and Montana is one of them\" - Richard Ham (Rahdo Runs Through)\nHalfway through the 19th century, the first permanent settlements appeared in Montana. After this, many fortune seekers traveled to this region with their caravans in search of work in order to build a better future for themselves. And there is an abundance of work. In the mountains, precious metals are to be found and in the fields a lot of manpower is required. Meanwhile, the number of settlements is growing and the demand for goods is rising. Recruit the right workers, deliver goods on time, and choose your settlements tactically. Only then you will have a chance of winning Montana.\nThe first player to build all of their settlements wins!\nPlease note:\n    (physical components of Montana)\n  Bring on the deluxe! Watch the campaign as we reveal special upgrades that will enhance your experience with Montana while making this Heritage Edition super deluxe!\n*remaining stock of exclusives are expected to be sold at conventions.\n  ...you'll do one of three actions:\n  A. Recruit\nSpin the Recruitment Wheel.\n(that's right... A SPINNER!)\nAfter you receive your workers, you can pay grain to mitigate the wheel for more! For each grain paid, advance the spinner one space and hire the extra two workers. This gives you four workers total for that action.\n  B. Work\nSend your workers to the bank, the mine, the quarry, the fields, or the farmland and pay the space's required money to receive the goods. You can choose to place an additional worker (or two workers of any color) to receive an extra good.\nThe workers will occupy their spaces until all spaces in that region are filled. Once there are no spaces available, the workers will be dismissed to the main supply.\nOr you can send your contractor to the city to auction for extra goods or to upgrade your stone and copper.\n  C. Build\nPay the goods indicated on the location you want to build and place one of your settlements there. You can build up to three settlements during this action.\nIf you place a settlement that completes a line of four, you get to place an additional settlement on top of the settlement just placed.\nAdditionally, if you build onto a location with a cow, you take the cow and place it on your player board. Cows can be used for cattle trade actions. If you are the first to build adjacent to a body of water, you take the canteen and place it on your player board. Canteens can be used to take an extra action, but only once.\nIf you don't build three settlements on your turn, take a silver for each settlement not built, for a maximum of two silver.\nBuilding settlements is ultimately how you win the game. The first player to build all of their settlements, is the winner of Montana!\n...in addition to one of these actions, you can perform a cattle trade.\n(cows for the win)\nThis action allows you to trade in a cow (if you have one) for one good of your choice, three silver, or one worker of your choice. This can be done ANYTIME during your turn and AS MANY times as you want. Go cows!\n  (physical components of Montana)\n    (for a more in depth look at The City, see rulebook below)\nYour player board is where everything is kept and also references game setup and player actions.\n(red player board)\n  (physical components of Montana)\n      (English rules in revison)\n     Zee with The Dice Tower gives a 'Seal of Approval' to Montana.\n Rahdo breaks down the elegance in the game in his \"final thoughts\".\n    Dan King shares about his enjoyable plays of Montana.\n Jeremy and David of Man vs. Meeple dive into the game.\nThe Game Boy Geek's Allegro Review\n(under 3 minutes)\n     Customs, Duty, and VAT free shipping!\nUS - Free shipping\nCanada - $7\nAustralia/New Zealand - $9\nWe have partnered with three great fulfillment companies to bring Montana Heritage Edition to you in a safe, timely, and courteous manner.

Wanting to make a story based on a hardened crew of women from Old York, the idea caught fire at the table.\nOver the next year and a half the project was written, rewritten, edited, changed, sketched, designed, and eventually got to the point where it was nearly ready for layout and release.\nAnd that is where we are today.\nThis is an amazing story is visually brought to life by the artwork of Lou Boyer, written by Ian Powell, and conceptually designed and based in the world created by Michael Pucci.\nThis project is already 85% ready for layout, with all of the pages already sketched, inked, colored, and having their final treatments done before going into layout.\nSo please, take a few minutes to take a glance at the world of Dystopia Rising if you don't know it. Follow the link to Lou Boyer's quick gallery, and take a moment to review the publication histories for Ian Powell and Michael Pucci. Backing this project is very little risk and will provide you with what we feel are some really nice rewards.\n  Eschaton Media INC - Creators of the Dystopia Rising universe\n  Work of Lou Boyer\n  Imagine Nation Collective - Projects of Ian Powell and Michael Pucci\nThe Comic Story Synopsis\nDystopia Rising - Grave Decisions is a story that follows what is potentially one of the worst case scenarios for a mercenary deal gone wrong. Our stories protagonists, Sheena, Yelena, and Lola, are a handful of Old York survivors who get caught up in a plot intertwining greed, religious zealotry, and high risk operations in the post-apocalyptic world of Dystopia Rising.\nDystopia Rising is a world that takes place many generations after the zombie apocalypse, where humanity has remembered as much as it has forgotten about the ways of the old world. This story arc intertwines with the canon of the game world in both the table top and LARP timelines, providing an incredible story from the Dystopia Rising universe.\nInitial character design sketches\n   \n  The Sweet, Sweet, Rewards.\nHOLY COW WE FUNDED IN A DAY!\nWith us funding so quickly we want to start putting out some adorable and fun thank yous extra rewards for every new benchmark we hit. You can still find all of the details about your base rewards below, but for ease of reading, we are going to put our stretch goals right here on top!\n    In addition to helping a comic book come to life that focuses on a group of badass female protagonists, you will be getting some SWEET rewards for helping make this comic come to life. Take a look below (and more importantly look again when you are donating to make this happen when you click which backer level you want) and see what amazing goods you can get for helping make this come to life.\nTHANK YOU!

Thank you for helping us make this project become a reality! \nNow we are making a mark in the apocalypse. If you can help us with support at $40 we will put your name in the graphic novel as a backer and ship you a hard copy of the book anywhere in the world. \nWhy hello there! Want to get the hard copy of the book for storage but read the digital version? Then step right up, this is the support level for you. At $50 you get the hard copy of the graphic novel, the digital copy of the graphic novel, and your name in the book as a backer! \nThis is where we get to some of the limited run pieces available to only Kickstarter backers. If you are able to support us with a backing of $90 we will provide you with the digital version of the graphic novel, the hard copy of the graphic novel signed by Lou, Ian, and Michael as well as a set of character design prints used in the initial stages of the project when we were finding the visual design and the voice of the characters. \nAnother very limited availability piece, with a slightly longer deadline due to your involvement in the work. If you are able to support us with a backing of $175 we will provide you with the digital version of the graphic novel, the hard copy of the graphic novel signed by Lou, Ian, and Michael, as well as something very special.

You will get your digital and hard copies delivered with everyone else, but the custom artwork will take more time. \n  When the project goes to layout and we get our initial prints in, there will be a handful of copies that we use for notation of changes that need to be made before the project goes to bulk print.

For now, it will not be punched through in the final version until we can provide you with something we can all appreciate. \nHorizons will come in a box similar in size to Stone Age and will come with all of the components shown below, plus whatever you unlock through stretch goals.\nUnlocked Stretch Goals added to the game:\n6 New Star Classes, O, B, A, F, K and M\nBlackcore and Linen Finish Cards\n5 Optional Species Ally Cards with Exterminate Gameplay\n5 New Asymmetrical Starter Ally Cards\nUnique Faction Art for each Player Board\n5 Asymmetrical Player Boards\n10 New Mission Cards\n5 New Ally Cards\nAs with our other recent projects, Sailing Toward Osiris, Food Truck Champion, and Valeria: Card Kingdoms \u2013 Flames & Frost, we'll be working with our European partners to produce Horizons in multiple languages. You'll be able to select the German, French, Spanish, or English version when we send out the backer surveys after the project is successfully funded.\n    Rahdo's final thoughts! (Note: we will be adding player count numbers on Mission cards to tell you which Mission cards to play with according to player count.)\n                                                                                                                                                             This is a full PNP file for Horizons. It included the rules, 35 double-sided hex tiles, 60 cards, and 5 player boards.  It is 113MB. There are bound to be a few adjustments as we close in on the final rules and graphic design, but this will give you a good look into the components and concepts of Horizons.\n                                                It's always great to try before you buy, so why not give Horizon's a try on Tabletop Simulator. This build was created by Alexander, a frequent backer of our project, a fan of our games, and a skilled modder.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                       We do everything we can to keep shipping costs low and we subsidize a substantial portion of the actual shipping fees we are charged when we fulfill your rewards.\n  This project is EU Friendly, Canada Friendly, and Australia Friendly. Rewards to backers in those countries will be shipped from fulfillment hubs within their regional borders. We pay VAT when we import the games and utilizing the shipping hubs means you do not have to pay customs fees.\n\nGamers in Brazil, Mexico, and Russia, have a much higher risk of package \"loss\" once it reaches the local post offices. For this reason, we need to ship your packages by a registered delivery service like FedEx, UPS, DHL, or Global Priority. The higher costs we incur are reflected in the shipping fees added automatically when you make your pledge.\nWe like to support game stores around the world by offering the Kickstarter versions of our games to retailers during the campaign. We treat retailer backers just like other backers in that they receive their rewards before we release the regular retail versions into distribution, giving you a head start on your competition. You can see the Retailer 6-Pack pledge level in the right-side column of this project page.\nEvery game we create is a discrete project with its own development schedule and its own budget for production and marketing expenses. We bring each project to Kickstarter to give you, our fans and supporters, the opportunity to help us put the final touches on the game and to reserve your copies at the time when it will do the game the most good, both financially and creatively.\n\nSome say that a creator should not launch a new project until their previous project is completed and delivered. That system might work for a designer who is self-publishing a game, but for an up-and-coming company like Daily Magic Games, that system is not viable. At any point in time we are working on a dozen projects in various stages of completion. Right now, for example...\n\n10 Minute Heist: The Wizard's Tower delivered to most backers 2 months early and will hit retail stores on September 20th.\nValeria: Card Kingdoms \u2013 Flames & Frost shipped to 80% of backers for on-time delivery in August. The remaining 20% will begin shipping in September. Valeria: Card Kingdoms \u2013 Flames & Frost will hit retail stores in October.\nFood Truck Champion is at the printer and we expect to deliver to backers in October. We will debut Food Truck Champion in English and German editions at EssenSpiel 2017 and release it to retail stores in November.\nSailing Toward Osiris is at the printer and we expect to deliver it to backers in February 2018. Sailing Toward Osiris will be produced in English, German, French, and Spanish and will debut at PAX East in March 2018. Sailing Toward Osiris will be released to retailers in March 2018.\nCrabs! completed its Kickstarter campaign successfully on August 11th and the files have just been transferred to the printer. We expect to deliver Crabs! to backers in March 2018 and to be on retail store shelves by May 2018.\nHorizons, by Levi Mote and Illustrated by The Mico, is live on Kickstarter right now, obviously. If the funding campaign is successful, our plans are to deliver Horizons to backers in July 2018, debut Horizons at GenCon 2018, then have it on store shelves in late August 2018.\nSarah\u2019s Singularity, a time travel game with comic book appeal by Thomas Gutschmidt and illustrated by Carey Pietsch, is going out to game reviewers in early September with a Kickstarter launch planned for October 10th. If the funding campaign is successful, we plan to deliver Sarah's Singularity to backers in July 2018.\nAlchemea, by Ian Stedman and illustrated by Claire Donaldson, is a reimagining of his game Magnum Opus. It is in beta testing.\nCorsairs: A Valeria Adventure, by Wouter van Strien, was inspired by his game Wacky Pirates and will be illustrated by The Mico. It is in beta testing.\nSpaceways, by Philip duBarry, is a sci-fi pick-up and deliver / area control game and is in beta testing. It is a standalone sequel to Horizons and will be illustrated by The Mico. \nChocolatiers, by Isaias Vallejo, is a gateway game where players take on the role of chocolatiers boxing chocolates and is in alpha testing.\nPeddlers, by Alice Davis, is a unique blend of card drafting and worker placement and is in alpha testing.\nWe're hoping that our track record for successfully completing and delivering previous projects will give you the confidence to support Horizons, and that the forthright communications we present when projects do hit snags will assuage any fears that we're going to screw it all up.\nBy the way, if you'd like to help us with any of our alpha or beta testing, please send us an email at contact[at]dailymagicgames[dot]com.\nDaily Magic Games is a designer-friendly and customer-focused publisher specializing in casual tabletop games that are easy to learn and play, yet layered with strategy and depth.\nIsaias Vallejo, Wizard-in-Chief, Game Designer, and Developer\nDavid MacKenzie, Conjurer and Game Developer\nLevi Mote, Alchemist, Game Designer, and Developer\nSarah Sharp, Enchantress and Convention Event Planner\nDylan Pharaoh-Whitney, Sorcerer and Graphic Designer\nClaire Donaldson, Illusionist, Illustrator, and Graphic Designer\nWe are focused on listening to what our customers have to say and making sure that we are producing the type of games you want at the high quality you demand. We are actively involved in the Comments section of each Kickstarter and keep backers up to date with plenty of updates post-Kickstarter. We like to make casual and gateway games in an effort to get more people to the table. Our games are easy to learn to help new players get in to the game faster, but they're also layered with strategy for the more seasoned players. We're based out of Seattle, Washington and like to focus on the growth and promotion of game design in the Pacific Northwest. We've even started a playtesting event network called PlaytestNW to help local designers meet each other and engage with playtesters on a regular basis. Our hope is that we're helping designers build better games.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nDaily Magic Games is committed to delivering quality products on time. We realize that the publication of a tabletop game can be complicated and, no matter how experienced the project creators and mangers are, some problems may occur. In an effort to reduce the likelihood of delays and mistakes, we have taken several steps to prepare for success:\n\n1. This game project, as well as the Kickstarter campaign itself, are in the hands of two well-seasoned professionals. David MacKenzie has been running successful Kickstarter projects since 2010 (Alien Frontiers started the gaming frenzy on Kickstarter), and Isaias Vallejo comes from a digital games background as Executive Producer at Big Fish Games and has designed several successful tabletop games (Sunrise City and the \"Valeria\" series of games).\n\n2. We are dedicated to backer communication and feedback. Throughout every campaign, we are as transparent about the process and as open to feedback as possible without jeopardizing production and delivery timelines. Whether the news is good or bad, you can expect us to report it honestly and openly.\n\n3. We have done significant pre-production. All the art and graphic design for Horizons are completed with the exception of the stretch goals content. The art and design for the stretch goals content has been sketched out and is ready to push forward as soon as each goal is achieved.\n\n4. We are working with publishing partners in Germany, France, and Spain, to bring Horizons to a wide audience, expanding our economies of scale in production and logistics.\n\n5. We have our manufacturer lined up and ready to begin the pre-press process as soon as the files are delivered. We hope that everything goes as planned, but if something falls through the cracks, we are ready and willing to employ every tool at our disposal to get the project back on track and running smoothly.\n\nThank you for your support!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "Premium PNP", "descp": "A Premium PNP PDF file with final print-ready rules and game components for the ENGLISH version of Horizons.

Highest value wins. It's a 2 or 4 player game (2 teams of 2). At the start of each round, each player is given 3 cards with which they must win at least 2 tricks out of 3 to win.

At any time in the round, as long as a player holds a card in his hand, whomever \"Truts\" simply announces to the opposing team he is certain to win the round. Of course, he can bluff. He's got 2 options then: to give up or take up the challenge!

Il serait un descendant du jeu d\u2019Aluette. Les anciens y jouent traditionnellement sans e\u0301changer la moindre parole... Leurs regards d\u2019acier e\u0301tant suffisamment e\u0301quivoques. De nos jours, il est encore pratique\u0301 en France avec un jeu de traditionnel 32 cartes par quelques irre\u0301ductibles dans les Deux-Se\u0300vres, le Maine-et-Loire et la Sarthe (province fran\u00e7aise), ainsi que dans certains pays de cultures hispaniques. Ce jeu, pourtant tre\u0300s dynamique, tombe lentement dans l\u2019oubli faute de pratiquants.\nDevant cette injustice, toute l\u2019\u00e9quipe de Robin Red Games (c\u2019est \u00e0 dire moi) s\u2019est mobilis\u00e9e pour \u00e9viter que ce jeu ne disparaisse totalement.\nTRUT is a card game called \"a counter one\" with uncertain origins of which one would have heard for of it the first time in the seventeenth century, somewhere in the west of France. It is believed to be a descendant of Alouette's game. Old people play it traditionally without exchanging a single word... Their iron looks are sufficiently equivocal. Nowadays, it is still practised with a traditional game of 32 cards by an irreducible few in Deux-S\u00e8vres, in Maine-et-Loire and in Sarthe, as well as in some Hispanic countries. This game, despite being very dynamic, is slowly falling into oblivion because of the lack of practitioners.\nFacing this injustice, the entire Robin Red Games (that is, for me) has mobilised in order to prevent this game's full disappearance.\nPar cette e\u0301dition personnalise\u0301e, j\u2019espe\u0300re lui redonner ses lettres de noblesse et lui rendre sa popularite\u0301. C\u2019est pourquoi j\u2019ai particuli\u00e8rement soign\u00e9 les illustrations (environ 192 heures de travail), tant dans le trait du dessin que dans le choix radical de l\u2019iconographie. Toutes les cartes sont diff\u00e9rentes. Mon objectif \u00e9tait de donner au jeu une identit\u00e9 visuelle forte et atypique. Le TRUT \u00e9tant encore farouchement pratiqu\u00e9 dans les Deux-S\u00e8vres, j\u2019ai d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de remercier ces vaillants pratiquants en utilisant pour les cartes \u00ab Secondaires \u00bb des d\u00e9cors typiques du pays de G\u00e2tine et des environs. Ainsi, les observateurs vigilants pourront reconna\u00eetre certains paysages ou monuments. \nThrough this personalised edition, I expect to give it back its nobility and restore its popularity. That is why I have particularly taken care of the illustrations (about 192 hours of work), both in drawings and in the radical choice of iconography. All cards are different. My goal was to give the game a strong and atypical visual identity. TRUT being still fiercely practised in Deux-S\u00e8vres, I decided to thank these valiant practitioners by using \"Secondary\" Typical scenery of the country of G\u00e2tine and the surroundings for cards. Thus, vigilant observers will recognize certain landscapes or monuments.\nLes re\u0300gles utilis\u00e9es sont celles les plus couramment pratique\u0301es.

The funding campaign will allow me, in addition to the various expenses inherent in the crowdfunding (shipping, commission...), to finance the launch of the game, the packaging and, I hope, the manufacture of the \"Bonus\" 3 cards, which add a little chaos to the mechanics of the game. \nConsidering the incredible success of this campaign, the impressive amount of SG released and especially the number of contributors, the date of shipment is delayed at the beginning of December 2017.\nLes frais de port / Delivery costs\nLes frais de ports sont GRATUITS pour la France.

La bo\u00eete contient 32 cartes de 58x88mm imprim\u00e9es en quadrichromie recto/verso sur un papier de 305g + 28 jetons de 15mm de diam\u00e8tre pour compter les points + 1 jeton \u00ab Donneur \u00bb + 1 livret de 32 pages contenant les r\u00e8gles du jeu en 5 langues (fran\u00e7ais, anglais, allemand, espagnol et n\u00e9erlandais). L\u2019utilisation du pion Donneur est facultative, il sert simplement a\u0300 de\u0301finir celui qui commence la manche (les manches sont si rapides que, parfois, dans le feu de l\u2019action, les joueurs peuvent perdre le fil). Les jetons sont utilise\u0301s pour comptabiliser les points. Les \u00ab Petits \u00bb sont noirs avec un trait orange et les \u00ab Longs \u00bb sont oranges avec un trait noir. Quand un joueur marque des points, il prend les pions correspondants et les place devant lui.\nTRUT game consists of a thick cardboard box (700g) on which is glued a sheet of coated paper (115g) printed in four-colour process, protected by a glossy UV varnish. The box contains 32 cards of 58x88mm printed on a paper of 305g + 28 tokens of 15mm diameter to count the score + 1 \"Dealer\" token + 1 booklet of 32 pages containing the rules of the game (available in 5 languages: French, English, German, Spanish and Dutch). The use of the Dealer token is optional; it's useful just to define who will begin the round (rounds are so fast that sometimes when action is on fire, players can lose track). Tokens are used to count the score. The \"Small\" ones are black with an orange line while the \"Long\" ones are orange with a black line. When a player scores, he takes the corresponding tokens and places them in front of him.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLe jeu \u00e9tant compos\u00e9 essentiellement de cartes et de jetons, le projet a un niveau de risque bien inf\u00e9rieur \u00e0 celui de beaucoup d'autres jeux plus complexes, notamment ceux qui n\u00e9cessitent la fabrication de figurines. De plus, comme le projet est d\u00e9j\u00e0 en cours de fabrication, il n\u2019y a tout simplement aucune chance pour qu\u2019il n\u2019aboutisse pas.\n\nCela \u00e9tant dit, bien que je me sois entour\u00e9 de fournisseurs comp\u00e9tents et efficaces, on ne peut pas exclure un probl\u00e8me technique impr\u00e9vu. Si cela devait se produire, il n\u2019y aurait, au pire, qu\u2019un retard d\u2019une quinzaine de jours. Bien \u00e9videment, vous en seriez imm\u00e9diatement inform\u00e9s.\n\nAttention aux frais de douane ! Les contreparties seront exp\u00e9di\u00e9es par La Poste en lettre suivi mais il se peut que certains pays en dehors de l'EU r\u00e9clame des frais de douane.\n\nThe game uses essentially cards and tokens, so the project has a much lower level of risk than many other more complex games, especially those requiring having figurines manufactured. Moreover, since the project is already under construction, there is simply no chance of not succeeding.\n\nThat being said, although I have surrounded myself with competent and efficient providers, one cannot rule out an unforeseen technical problem. If this were to happen, there would be, at worst, only a delay of about fifteen days. Obviously, you would be immediately informed.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u20ac5 or more", "title": "NUMERIK", "descp": "Le fichier PDF des \u00e9l\u00e9ments du jeu en t\u00e9l\u00e9chargement.\nINCLUDES:\nLes cartes + Les r\u00e8gles + Les tuiles, au format PDF", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2017"}], "stat": ["3 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac12 or more", "title": "BASIC", "descp": "1 exemplaire du jeu + 1 sticker exclusif\nINCLUDES:\n1 bo\u00eete-cloche\n32 cartes\n1 livret de r\u00e8gle\n28 Jetons\n1 pion \"Donneur\"", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["58 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac20 or more", "title": "FAN", "descp": "1 exemplaire du jeu + 1 sticker exclusif + 1 marque-page exclusif + 1 badge exclusif + 1 d\u00e9dicace + Tous les objectifs atteints\nINCLUDES:\n1 bo\u00eete-cloche\n1 livret de r\u00e8gle\n32 cartes\n28 Jetons\n1 pion \"Donneur\"\n1 sticker exclusif\n1 marque-page exclusif\n1 Badge exclusif\n1 D\u00e9dicace\n+ Tous les objectifs atteints", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["593 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac36 or more", "title": "DOUBLE-FAN", "descp": "2 exemplaires du jeu + 2 stickers exclusif + 2 marques-page exclusifs + 2 badges exclusifs + 2 d\u00e9dicaces + 2x Tous les objectifs atteints\nINCLUDES:\n2x la contribution FAN\n2x tous les objectifs atteints", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["171 backers"]}], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #59", "update_userinfo": "Status report and planning", "update_content": " Hello everyone ! \nAll the packages of the contributors having filled the Pledge Manager are shipped.

Hunt", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Hi! This is a Kickstarter project for an expansion to my hit board game The Networks. \nNot familiar with it? That's okay! Here's a website where you can learn more about the base game, and here's the Kickstarter project from 2015 where over 2,700 generous backers pledged over $100,000 to make it a reality.\nThe Networks is now in its third printing. It's been printed in Chinese, there's a German version in the works, and more languages are on their way. \nLike what you see? If your friendly local or online game store is sold out of The Networks, the base game is available from this campaign.\nYou'll need a copy of the base game to play The Networks: Executives.\nAnd now you're all caught up!\nSo you\u2019ve proven your worth in the past. We know you can run an ordinary TV network. Big deal.\nWe have a bigger challenge for you. Here are 12 unique Network Executives, each with their own weird characteristics. Every Executive has powers, but they also have significant liabilities. Can you master each Executive\u2019s idiosyncrasies, draft the best Season 0 cards, claim your true status as a Mogul, and come out on top?\n           The Networks: Executives adds three major components to The Networks: Executives, Season 0 Cards, and Mogul Cards.\nThe Executives are the biggest addition to the game. The expansion comes with 12 Executives in the box. Each one will significantly change the way you play the game by giving you a set of distinct powers and liabilities.\nYou can play as Flix, which turns your network into a streaming service that lets you consider all your Shows as being in their proper time slots... but every time you switch genres within a time slot, you lose Viewers.\nYou can play as Beeb, which turns your network into a state-run enterprise that tends to generate revenue. But because you now have a lot of bureaucracy to deal with, you must use a rondel to choose your actions.\nYou can play as Telethon, which turns your network into a public broadcasting network. You may not hold Ads in your Green Room. But you may hold a telethon once per season to ask other players for money, in exchange for powerful Sponsorship Tokens. If they don't give you money, you get to keep the Sponsorship Token to use yourself.\nAnd so on. With all the Executives in the game, the amount of challenge and replayability grows enormously. \nThe Season 0 Cards are a new way to begin the game. Instead of everyone starting with similar Shows, Stars, and Ads, you will now begin the game with a draft. Everyone starts with a hand of 4 Season 0 Shows, and chooses one as their 8 pm Show. Most Season 0 Shows get you Stars, Ads, and/or Money, but have no genre and give you no Viewers. Others have a genre and Viewers, but get you nothing else.\nOnce you've selected your 8 pm Show and received anything it gives you, you'll pass the remaining 3 Season 0 Cards to the player on your left and receive 3 cards from the player on your right. Everyone will now choose their 9 pm Show, and so on.\nThis starting draft ensures that players begin the game with completely different setups. Some players may begin with a stocked green room, but no Shows with Genres. Other players may get shows with Genres to get a head-start on their Genre Bonus, but with little in their green room.\nWhy is the race to a Genre Bonus important? Because of the third addition to the game: Mogul Cards. These are effectively supercharged Network Cards. At the start of the game, you'll deal out a number of them to the table equal to the number of players plus one. These will be the only Mogul Cards available in the game; you will not replenish these between Seasons.\nYou get a Mogul Card by either getting your first 5-Show Genre Bonus, or your second 3-Show Genre Bonus. You can no longer draw Network Cards or trade in money for Viewers after a 5-Show Genre Bonus, but some Mogul Cards still let you do that. \nMogul Cards even out some lategame swinginess present in the base game and give players a long-term goal to shoot for.\nWith these three huge additions to the base game, The Networks becomes a much deeper and more replayable game!\nWant to know more? Here's a draft of the rulebook for the expansion!\nWant to try it? If you have a copy of the base game, here's a free PNP of the expansion! \n    \"If you ever thought what your damp, shoddy, and structurally unsound public access TV station experience needed was to give more attention to the equally shoddy and unsound eccentricity of its management, then you're in luck! Because that's what Executives is all about.\" - Cardboard Republic\n\"The Executives adds a ton of variability and exciting new strategies to the base game! The wide array of player powers and Season Zero starting options makes every player's game feel unique with interesting and challenging decisions. The addition of Mogul cards give players powerful rewards to work towards, and the new shows inject welcome new content for regular players. More than an essential expansion, The Executives is a reward for Networks fans!\" - Danielle and Jake Bock, Draft Mechanic\n\"When we played it was obvious that this expansion gives The Networks a ton of replayability. This is totally an expansion you need if you like the original game.\" - Gameosity\n             \"...The Networks is a well crafted card-drafting game. The game remains engaging throughout the entire playing time, and the escalating strength of the three Show decks gives a nice trajectory to the strategy/scoring.\" - The Opinionated Gamers\n\"This is the perfect medium-weight game... I\u2019m impressed with what Gil Hova has done in The Networks and look forward to seeing how it will do on Kickstarter. He\u2019s made a solid game with a great sense of humor. And yes, it was difficult to cancel \u201cAn Hour of Shouting\u201d, but it didn\u2019t bring in the viewers I needed. There\u2019s no room for sentimentality on the Networks.\" - Indie Cardboard\n\"The Networks is, quite literally, my favorite Euro-style game. Gil Hova has done what many have found unthinkable, combining a deep economic game of resource management with sharp humor and an incredibly engaging narrative. It's a perfect blend of mechanism and theme. It is, in short, UHF: The Euro Game. And you need it in your collection.\" - Your Moderator Chris, Flip the Table podcast\n\"If you're looking for some lighter fun with a backbone, and fantastic dad puns, you can feel good spending an hour of your table time with it... I think Gil's game is smart, well-designed, and it sneaks in a challenging game under the cover of humor.\" - Heavy Cardboard\n\"With screwball humor and well-developed mechanics, this game offers both charming flavor and solid design. The Networks is basically UHF: The Board Game. It encourages you to excel at the inanity of television programming on the one hand while lambasting it on the other, and yet this charming mix of motives adds up to a game that\u2019s amusing and strategic all at once.\" - The Cardboard Republic review (Awarded the Seal of the Republic!)\n\"The Networks is a thoroughly enjoyable card game. Deciding when to develop new shows and drop existing shows, as well as what time slots, who will star in them and what advertising to use is surprisingly fun. The game plays fast, is easy to teach but has many tough decisions. I cannot wait to see what potential additions come about from stretch goals for this game\u2019s Kickstarter campaign.\" - Board Game Quest\n\"All-in-all, I really enjoyed The Networks. It is approachable, funny, and smart all at the same time. I know that this is a game that I can bring out with newer gamers because they will have a blast with the theme, yet I can also bring it out with more hardcore gamers due to its subtle depth. Gil Hova of Formal Ferret Games has created an impressive gem; One which points to a bright and successful future for this indie publisher. I can\u2019t wait to see what kind of cards and new ideas will make their way into future expansions. Any game that can make me want more while still feeling like a complete and final product has something special going for it.\"- Meeple Mountain\n\"This is a winner. I want one. We're actually going to fight over this copy.\" - Punching Cardboard\n\"Overall, The Networks was done beautifully and kept me wanting more... kinda like my yearn for reality television, but much less guilty this time around.\" - Indie Tabletop\n\"The Networks is simply an extremely well-designed game... and the gameplay is just so solid. Maybe it\u2019s true that there\u2019s nothing good on TV, but, quite frankly, with The Networks, I\u2019ve already got plenty of entertainment at my fingertips.\" - Gameosity\n\"Like an episode of Game of Thrones, this game is addicting and leaves you wondering how the last 60 minutes flew by so quickly. The Networks is must-see-TV and I highly recommend you check it out.\" - League of Nonsensical Gamers\n\"...it\u2019s strong in all its elements \u2013 theme, gameplay, strategic challenge, accessibility, length, graphics, humor \u2013 across the board, making for a fantastic game that\u2019s greater than the sum of its already solid parts. A game of The Networks is more fun than drinking from the fire hose, and in the end, fun is what it\u2019s all about.\" - Up With Meeple\n  At this pledge level, you can stay subscribed to updates about the game. Every little bit helps!\nThis pledge level is for retailers only. It will allow retailers to buy The Networks and The Networks: Executives by the case. If you pledge at this level, you will buy the games as an add-on, so you will not be charged until just before the games get shipped to you. \nThis pledge level will allow you to get digital Print-and-Play files (PNPs) for The Networks, The Networks: Executives, and The Networks: On the Air. You will need to print these files out and cut them into cards in order to play the game. \nThis pledge level gets you one physical copy of The Networks: Executives and all PNPs. This pledge level does not include a copy of the base game.\nIf you're in Australia, New Zealand, Denmark, Norway, or Iceland, please back the game at the International Executive level, which will offer a reduced shipping rate!\nThis pledge level gets you one physical copy of The Networks: Executives, one physical copy of The Networks: On the Air, and all PNPs. This pledge level does not include a copy of the base game.\nOn the Air is a mini-expansion containing the stretch goals achieved from the previous Kickstarter campaign, with extra Shows, Stars, and Ads, as well as stickers to put on your turn order and scoring markers and some blank cards to come up with your own Shows and Stars.\nThis will be a new printing of On the Air, so the quality here should be more consistent than the first printing.\nIf you're in Australia, New Zealand, Denmark, Norway, or Iceland, please back the game at the International Executive with bonuses level, which will offer a reduced shipping rate!\nThis pledge level gets you one physical copy of The Networks base game, one physical copy of The Networks: Executives, and all PNPs.\nThere are still quite a few copies of the base game floating around local and online game stores. I heartily encourage you to consider buying the base game from your favorite game store. You'll support their business, and you'll be familiar with the base game by the time The Executives arrives at your door!\nIf you're in Australia, New Zealand, Denmark, Norway, or Iceland, please back the game at the Executive Int'l Vice President level, which will offer a reduced shipping rate!\nThis pledge level gets you one physical copy of The Networks base game, one physical copy of The Networks: Executives, one physical copy of The Networks: On the Air, and all PNPs. \nIf you're in Australia, New Zealand, Denmark, Norway, or Iceland, please back the game at the Executive Int'l Vice President with bonuses level, which will offer a reduced shipping rate!\nThis pledge level contains everything that the Executive Vice President+ pledge level gets you, PLUS you get to name an Executive!\nHere's how it works. Each Executive is double-sided, with a female figure on one side and a male figure on the other. Each Executive has a stock name for their power, e.g. Mr./Ms. Rich, Mr./Ms Cheapo, Mr./Ms. Telethon, and so on. But at this level, you'll supply us with the Executive's real name, like \"Martha Higgenbottom III, Esq.\" \nYou're welcome to choose your own name, the name or nickname of a friend or loved one, or a fictional name you just think sounds cool. I will have veto power over all names, though, so please don't submit anything off-color or unpleasant!\nThis pledge level contains everything that the Executive Vice President+ pledge level gets you, PLUS you get to name a Network!\nHere's how it'll work. There are 5 player boards, just as in the base game. These player boards will be divided into a Network Name board, showing the name of your network and your player color, and an Executive board, reminding you of what powers you have.\nThe Network Name boards will be double-sided. The existing network names from the base game (U62, VCK, PKW, ICS, and MOO) will still be on one side of the board, but the name you select will be on the other, along with a brand-new design.\nI will have veto power over all names, though, so please don't submit anything off-color or unpleasant!\nWant more copies of the game? You can add them on here!\nI will be using a pledge manager called BackerKit to help manage add-ons. So while you can pay for these add-ons by increasing your pledge, you can also wait until the campaign ends. Either way, you'll submit the add-ons when you give me your mailing address. Then, if your pledge isn't enough to cover the add-ons, BackerKit will prompt you to cover the difference. \nI used BackerKit in my previous campaign for Wordsy, and I found it made my job exponentially easier. Hopefully it will help you out as well! \nNote that all these prices are without shipping. I will calculate add-on shipping costs closer to the end of the campaign.\nYou can order an extra copy of The Networks base game for $50 extra, plus shipping.\nYou can make it a 3-pack (add 2 copies of The Networks base game to your pledge) by adding $90 to your pledge. This 3-pack offer is only available if you have pledged at a level that includes the base game as a reward level ($79 and up).\nYou can order an extra copy of The Networks: Executives for $29 extra, plus shipping.\nYou can make it a 3-pack (add 2 copies of The Networks: Executives to your pledge) by adding $50 to your pledge. This 3-pack offer is only available if you have pledged at a level that includes The Executives as a reward level ($29 and up).\nYou can order an extra copy of The Networks: On the Air for $6. \nThere are no quantity deals available for The Networks: On the Air.\nThe Networks: On the Air contains stretch goals from the first Networks campaign; see the $35 pledge level above for more details. \nThese stretch goals will not come in the retail box for the expansion! Instead, they'll be packaged in external expansions that will be available once the expansion is out in stores.\nThis means the stretch goals below are not exclusives. However, they will be tougher to get ahold of than the base game or expansion, so this is your best opportunity to pick them up! \nCOMPLETE! At $30,000, the project has been officially funded. Hooray!\nCLEAR! At $40,000, all backers pledging $29 and up will now receive 20 clear plastic cubes to replace the black timing cubes from the base game. A lot of people who play The Networks like to place their timing cubes directly over the number of viewers they're getting that season, in case they have a show on at the wrong time slot. Transparent cubes will make that a lot easier!\nCOMPLETE! Meet the Gorilla! At $50,000, all backers pledging $29 and up will receive a 13th Network Executive.\nThis character is the 800-pound gorilla. When playing, you will get extra money at the start of each Season ($2M per player in the game), and extra Viewers at the end of the game (1 Viewer per player in the game). The downside? You go last every Season, regardless of your score. Quite a challenge!\nCOMPLETE! Meet Continuum! At $60,000, all backers pledging $29 and up will receive a 14th Network Executive.\nThis character is a time traveler! Once per Season, you may spend money to run your time machine to take two actions on your turn. If you don't do that during the Season, you may run it at the end of the Season to consider one of your Shows as being in its proper time slot.\nWhen you run your time machine, you'll take an Anomaly card and put it on top of the Star Deck. Any player who gets that card, either through drawing from the top of the Star Deck, or in the following Season, when the card becomes one of the Stars available to Sign, puts it in their Green Room. You can spend an Anomaly to get two actions on your turn.\nCOMPLETE! At $70,000, we will give each Network Executive its own logo! This will make them easier to distinguish from one another.\nI have a signature up there, but they won't necessarily look like signatures. Rich may have their name written in diamonds, Butcher will be sharp and maybe drip something red, and so on. It's going to look cool!\nCOMPLETE! OK, this one is exciting. At $80K, I'll provide replacement scoring markers in all colors that will replace the squares that came in the base game. These scoring markers will look like cute little TVs! And they'll still stack nicely like the original discs.\nNote that the image above is just a mockup; they will not necessarily look exactly like that, but it's the spirit of what we want!\nCOMPLETE! ...and here's the companion to the $80K stretch goal! At $90K, I'll provide replacement turn order marker in all colors that will replace the discs that came in the base game. They'll look like little remote controls!\nNote that the image above is just a mockup; they will not necessarily look exactly like that, but it's the spirit of what we want!\nAt $100K, you'll get a new Season Marker that will replace the current one. It's going to look like a TV tower!\nNote that the image above is just a mockup; they will not necessarily look exactly like that, but it's the spirit of what we want!\nWhen I launched this Kickstarter, I was going to ship out the base game along with Executives, in the same package. But at $125K, I will be able to manufacture the base game first, get that on a cargo ship ASAP, and deliver it to you in a separate package a few months before Executives!\nIn a week or two, I will have a better estimate of when I can fulfill the base game if we reach this stretch goal. Right now, it's looking like we can deliver it no later than April 2018, possibly sooner.\nThis stretch goal will only affect folks who pledge at $75 and up. \nAt $150K, all backers who pledge $29 and up will get all starter Shows, Stars, and Ads from the base game, with special rules on how to incorporate them in Networks: Executives!\nThis stretch goal has been requested by a few backers. I had to figure out a way to smoothly incorporate them into the experience, but after some testing, I think I have it.\nAll Starter Shows will now all be gray \"no-genre\" cards, but will have the same names and art as from the base game.\nIMPORTANT - If you are in Australia, New Zealand, Norway, Iceland, or Switzerland, and you want to back at the $29 or $35 levels, make sure you pledge at the International Executive or International Executive with Bonuses levels. Those will give you better shipping rates!\nNote that there's a slight omission in the pledge level bullet points for the International Executive pledge level. There should be a bullet point for a physical copy of the On the Air expansion.\nFor this campaign, I am providing a $7 discount on shipping for all backers. This won't reduce your shipping cost to $0, but I hope it will take most of the sting out of the shipping bill.\nIf you're backing in Canada, you will not have to pay any extra charges beyond shipping. All rewards will ship from Starlit Citadel, based in Vancouver.\nIf you're a customer within the EU, your rewards will ship from within the EU. This means people who live in EU-member countries will not have to pay VAT. Hooray!\nKeep in mind that some countries like Switzerland are physically within the continent of Europe but are not EU members. If you're in a non-EU-member nation, you may still have to pay customs, taxes, or import fees on your package.\nIf you are in the EU and choose either the $29 or $35 pledges, your package will not be tracked by default, as that increases shipping costs significantly. If you fall into this category and prefer your package to be tracked, message me and we can work something out.\nOne more note on current events: At the time of this campaign, the UK is still part of the EU. The current plan is to ship all EU rewards (including UK rewards) from the UK. \nIt's unlikely that will change by the time of fulfillment, but if it does, I will send UK rewards from within the UK and EU rewards from a different fulfillment center within the EU. \nEither way, if you are in the EU right now, you will not have to pay VAT!\n   Gil Hova - Game Designer\n Travis Kinchy - Illustrator\nHeiko G\u00fcnther - Graphic Designer\nKickstarter Page Graphic Design\nDaniel Newman\nMain video voices:\nEthan Hova\nGil Hova\nBrodrick Jones\nCarrie Margulies\nJosephine Stewart\nMain video animation:\nBen Shulman, Jellybean Soup\nMain video music:\n\"Magic Forest,\" \"Enter the Party,\" \"Eighties Action,\" \"Surf Shimmy,\" \"Egmont Overture (Beethoven),\" \"Malt Shop Bop,\" \"DarxieLand,\" \"EDM Detection Mode,\" \"Teddy Bear Waltz,\" and \"Lost Time,\" by Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License  ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nBoard games are hard to make! Anyone who's used Kickstarter to back a tabletop game can tell you about projects that funded but delivered late... if at all.\n\nI've been designing games for a long time, and I now have three successful Kickstarter projects under my belt: The Networks' base game, Wordsy, and Bad Medicine. And by \"successful,\" I don't just mean that they funded. All of my projects have shipped to backers around the world within a month of the estimated ship date.\n\nI've backed enough projects to know what tends to go wrong with a tabletop campaign. Here is what I'm doing to make sure The Networks: Executives will not be delayed.\n\nFirst: Game design and graphic design are mostly done. This game is less than a month away from being ready to be sent to the manufacturer. In fact, I will begin the pre-production process with my manufacturer during the Kickstarter campaign, which should save us some time.\n\nSecond: One lesson I learned since the original Kickstarter campaign for The Networks was a better understanding of manufacturing and quality. Since then, I've switched manufacturers. Ever since the second printing of The Networks, I've used Panda Games, one of the biggest and best-known hobby game printers in the world. I've also used them for my game Wordsy. They deliver incredibly high-quality products on time.\n\nThird: I will be using several board game fulfillers to deliver The Networks: Executives to the US and most of the world. That leaves shipping in the hands of people who can send packages safely and quickly, and who understand that tabletop games require more packaging than other products. \n\nFourth: I am using a company called OTX to handle the logistics of transporting the manufactured games from the plant in China to the warehouse in the US. This is an intricate process, but OTX is quite used to it, and they specialize in board game logistics. I've used OTX to deliver two printings of The Networks and the first printing of Wordsy, so I know they're reliable.\n\nFifth: I've backed plenty of Kickstarter projects, some which delivered on time, some which delivered late, and some that never delivered at all. I learned a lot from each of them.\n\nAt this point, I'm familiar with just about everything that can go wrong in a Kickstarter. Believe me, failing to fund is not even close to the worst-case scenario! I've heard many stories, from artists never delivering their art, to pallets stolen at the port, to mold in the game boxes and snails in the shipping container.\n\nBut I've built a great team around me. I feel that I am prepared to deliver this product to you close to my estimate of July 2018.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Viewer", "descp": "Thank you for keeping an eye on the campaign!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2017"}], "stat": ["84 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 2 or more", "title": "Business Partner", "descp": "This level is only for retailers!

Hunt", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": " INTRODUCTION\nAlexander III, heir to the throne of the ancient Greek kingdom of Macedon, took the mantle of Greek leadership from his father and led a Greek coalition army in an unparalleled military campaign through northeast Africa and deep into Asia, creating with his conquests a vast empire with a historically unprecedented size. \nHistory has granted him the title of Great not only for his accomplishments, but for his brilliant tactical mind and innovative military tactics he used, allowing him to be undefeated in battle throughout his campaign until his death from illness at the age of 33. His achievements were used by later military leaders as a measure of success and his tactics are being taught in military academies to this day. \nAlexander was more than just a conqueror. He may have adopted his father\u2019s vision of leading the Greeks in conquering Persia, but in the process, he left a legacy to the world by spreading the Greek culture far and wide, thus creating a new Hellenistic civilization, evidence of which are found until this day.   \n Alexander's Campaign is a fast paced tactical historical boardgame for 2-3 players, that follows Alexander's Campaign in the east step by step, from 334 to 324 BC. Each player assumes the role of one of Alexander\u2019s Generals (Hetairoi), each with his own special ability and unique characteristics. Every turn Alexander moves forward in his conquest of Persia and players are taking turns in taking one of the available actions. As Alexander\u2019s Generals, the players strive to conquer enemy cities through military might or crafty diplomacy in an attempt to fulfill their personal agenda. \n In addition to the military aspect of the game, players also construct strongholds, establish cities or build temples to multiply the Conquest points gained by claiming each city. In this tile (hand) management game, each player has a set number of tactics tiles which once used are spent, with the only way to replenish them being through enforcement of taxation on each passing city. Every tactic tile is unique and can be used in a variety of ways, such as combat, as a resource for building or for its own special ability, thus players have to find the optimum tactical approach in using/spending their tactic tiles, furthering their agenda while foiling the plans of their fellow generals.   \nSOLO & CO OP VARIANT\nWe are currently finishing development of the Solo and co op Variant for Alexander's Campaign. Will be included in the final published version of the game. \n  Pre-Published version of the Rules\nPlease note that all the video previews and the rulebook, feature prototype components which in no way reflect the quality of the final product and were created with the sole purpose to show Alexander\u2019s Campaign to those whose opinion we value. \nA Video Review by Unfiltered Gamer :\n A tutorial video by Cardboard Rhino:\nA Video Review by Just got Played: \n A German Video Review by Lets Boardgame:  \n A German how to play video by Lets Boardgame:  \n A Video Review in English by Lets Boardgame :\n          Want more than 1 copy of Alexander's Campaign? You can add more copies of Alexander's Campaign (max. 3 copies) by adding following:\nIf you want 1 extra copy, add $37 to your pledge (shipping included).\nIf you want 2 extra copies, add $74 to your pledge (shipping included).   \nShould you choose this option, please let us know with a message (via Kickstarter).  \n      We are a fairly new group of board game designers, with some veterans among us. As a team we have successfully funded, published and delivered 2 successful projects, Argonauts and Deus Ex Machina. Alcyon Creative is a small indie publisher, so we don't have access to traditional distribution and we also lack the funds required to produce the minimum number of copies in a print run (including all relevant expenses like artwork, graphic design etc.). \nWe believe in our project, thus we once more managed to invest around 2000 EUR (roughly 2400 USD) for artwork, graphic design and other miscellaneous costs for this campaign. In order for us to bring Alexander\u2019s Campaign to life, we ask for your help to gather the rest of the required funds and accomplish our goal of publishing our game. \nOnce published, the M.S.R.P. for Alexander\u2019s Campaign will be 50 USD. As for the pledge levels we have decided on a different approach. We will discontinue our regular pledge of 44 USD (including worldwide shipping) and keep our previous Early Bird pledge level of 39 USD (including worldwide shipping) as our regular one. With a our shipping rate of 10 USD, the previous rate translates to 29 USD (42% discount)! \nOne of our fundamental principles when publishing a game is our \u201cno discounts on quality\u201d policy. Our manufacturer's work has received overly positive feedback for both Argonauts and Deus Ex Machina and it was only natural for us to hire their services once more! \nWe at Alcyon Creative as well as our previous backers were extremely satisfied with the quality of the materials used. Alexander\u2019s Campaign will be made 100% in Europe. \nWe will fulfill all the shipping ourselves from within the EU. Our estimated delivery will be within November 2017, provided there are no unexpected or unforeseen delays in the production and handling process. All European backers don't have to worry about customs.\nWe have a unified cost for Worldwide shipping of 10 USD. We take extra care to pack each game securely with bubble-wrap and seal it inside the shipping box to avoid any damage to the content. \nShipments to non-EU backers will have 16 EUR declared as the value of the package. That's roughly equivalent to 19 USD / 24 CAD / 24 AUD / 17 CHF / 2264 JPY, and should be under the threshold that triggers customs duties in most countries. However, please note that we cannot be held responsible should any customs fees apply. \nOur shipping method does not include tracking. Our experience with our previous projects has proved our current method safe and with a minimal (almost 0%) chance of lost items.If tracking is important to you, please contact us via the KS messaging system before the campaign is over.\nAs for the Essen pickup pledge, we would like to inform you that your game will be available for pickup at the booth of our friends from Artipia Games.\nDeus Ex Machina was published in 2016 via a successful Kickstarter campaign. It's a competitive game for 2-4 players with an innovative hero placement mechanism, set in mythological ancient Greece, where players assume the role of an Olympian god trying to achieve supremacy over the other gods via manipulation of heroes and behind the scenes planning. \nOfficial website,   BGG \nArgonauts was published in 2015 via a successful Kickstarter campaign. It's a cooperative game for 1-4 players set in mythological ancient Greece, depicting with great accuracy the myth of the Jason and the Argonauts.    \nOfficial website,   BGG\nGothic Invasion was published in 2014 and it\u2019s a competitive strategy game for 2 to 5 players, where players play either as the Goths or the Romans. The Goths\u2019 goal is to raid and pillage the roman cities in the Balkan area, while the Romans\u2019 goal is to prevent them from doing so. \nOfficial website,   BGG  \n       ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAlexander\u2019s Campaign will be printed and shipped from within the EU. We expect excellent quality manufacturing. We are working with a known, respected manufacturer who we've employed in the past for Argonauts and Deus Ex Machina and had amazing results!\n\nWe are also confident in our ability to deliver the game and any additional content we create for this game. We do not have to wait for any containers from overseas.\n\nThe artwork for the game is complete. That said, unforeseen events may affect how quickly fulfillment is conducted, and the final graphics and components that you see presented here are subject to (however improbable) change.\n\nNote that our goal is to ship the game on time, by the dates listed on the pledge levels. Shipping a package is different than delivering a package. We do not deliver your game, the shipping company does.

We will not offer refunds because of delays in delivery or changes/adjustments to the game's components, layout etc. or for damaged components that we are able to replace. We will examine any request for a full refund separately and may refund only the cases we feel the request for a full refund is justified.\n\nUNDELIVERED ITEMS \nIf a package is not delivered due to a backer's fault (wrong address given, backer didn't claim the delivered package from their post office, etc), the backer may be requested to pay additional shipping fees for the item to be sent out again.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "THANK YOU", "descp": "As a token of our gratitude you get a high-res digital copy of the front box cover!\nINCLUDES:\nBox Cover High-Res art", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2017"}], "stat": ["5 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 29 or more", "title": "PTOLEMY (ESSEN PICKUP)", "descp": "Alexander's Campaign base game plus all unlocked stretch goals!\nM.S.R.P. $50\nTo be picked up from Artipia Games booth at Spiel 2017 (Essen, Germany).\nINCLUDES:\na copy of Alexander's Campaign\na set of Stretch Goal rewards achieved by this campaign", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2017"}], "stat": ["47 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 29 or more", "title": "CRATERUS", "descp": "Alexander's Campaign base game plus all unlocked stretch goals!\nM.S.R.P. $50\nINCLUDES:\na copy of Alexander's Campaign\na set of Stretch Goal rewards achieved by this campaign", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["113 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 62 or more", "title": "SELEUKUS", "descp": "INCLUDES:\na copy of Alexander's Campaign\na set of Stretch Goal rewards achieved by this campaign\na copy of Deus Ex Machina + Mini Expansion", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["17 backers", "Limited (3 left of 20)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 58 or more", "title": "ANTIGONUS", "descp": "INCLUDES:\na copy of Alexander's Campaign\na set of Stretch Goal rewards achieved by this campaign\na copy of Gothic Invasion + All Expansions", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["Reward no longer available", "20 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 90 or more", "title": "LYSIMACHUS", "descp": "INCLUDES:\na copy of Alexander's Campaign\na set of Stretch Goal rewards achieved by this campaign\na copy of Deus Ex Machina + Mini Expansion\na copy of Gothic Invasion + All Expansions", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["Reward no longer available", "30 backers"]}], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #12", "update_userinfo": "Summer refreshing news!!", "update_content": "Dear friends of Alcyon Creative,\nIt's been a long time!

Hunt", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage is one of the best two-player games ever published. The game is renowned for its tense, well-balanced mechanics. And it tells a great story. HANNIBAL crossing the Alps on his herd of elephants is one of the most memorable events in history.\nThe development team at PHALANX has given this game a careful, meticulous update. It is now easier and faster to play. It plays considerably shorter. It has received new, stunning art. It is even better than it used to be.\n20th Anniversary Edition prototype.\nThere is even another game in the box: HAMILCAR, which portrays the events of the First Punic War.\nAnd there's more to discover.\nClick here for description in French.\nClick here for description in German.\nClick here for description in Spanish.\nWhat's in the Box\nKickstarter Special Expansions\nGame overview\nHANNIBAL & HAMILCAR is a card-driven political game for 2 players set during the Second Punic War, the epic struggle between ancient Rome and Carthage. That conflict has in many ways defined our modern reality. It took Rome over 100 years to win the competition with Carthage and three long wars were fought in the process. Our game takes considerably less time. Some scenarios are playable in under 30 minutes.\nHANNIBAL has been designed by one of the most acclaimed designers in the world, Mark Simonitch. This 20th Anniversary Edition of the game includes new scenarios and variants. We have streamlined certain game mechanics, while producing exactly the same game results as the golden classic. The game original rules and components were updated by Mark Simonitch and Jaro Andruszkiewicz.\nHANNIBAL has won numerous awards, including the Golden Geek Best 2-Player Board Game Award and the Golden Geek Best Wargame Award, and is ranked 11th on the BoardGameGeek.com's Wargame Rankings.\nHANNIBAL is actually more of an asymmetrical political game than a wargame. It presents a conflict between two superpowers of Antiquity from a classical Clausewitzian perspective, according to which a power only reverts to military operations when there is no other way to achieve the goal: political dominance.\nThe long-awaited HAMILCAR companion game is also included in the Anniversary Edition.\nHAMILCAR, which is set during the First Punic War, is a stand-alone game using similar mechanics. It introduces a naval system and exciting naval battles. Both players compete for control of the Mediterranean Sea, in a conflict which will be described as the first war between an elephant and a whale - the struggle of a land-based empire versus the world\u2019s naval power. Rome's goal was to break through the island chain of Sicily, Corsica, and Sardinia - Carthage's defensive line to contain Rome on the Italian peninsula.\nClick here to find more about the HAMILCAR game.\nExample of Gameplay\nHannibal begins in Spain and needs to move quickly to Italy if he wants to protect his allies in Gallia Cisalpina and secure the province.\n1. Carthage plays a Forced March card and moves Hannibal from Saguntum to Helvii.\n2. Rome plays Allied Auxiliaries from ETRURIA and brings P. Scipio army to 10 Combat Units.\n3. Hannibal, with the help of Native Guide sets out a journey across the Alps. He loses 1 Combat Unit to Attrition (roll of 3) and arrives in a friendly tribe space.\n4. Rome is itching for battle. A Campaign card is played and P. Scipio moves to meet Hannibal in a battle which will be remembered as the Battle of Trebbia.\nP. Scipio attacks with Frontal Attack in a true Roman style. This is matched by Hannibal, who seizes the Initiative. He attacks with his Right Flank and even if the Roman Consul is able to respond twice, he is unable to take the Initiative. Both sides lose 2 Combat Units each, and P. Scipio loses another 4 Combat Units in Retreat.\nP.Scipio retreats to Rome. The Roman player has to remove 3 Political Control markers as Political Consequences of the Battle.\n5. The Carthaginian player plays the Numidian Ally strategy card to place three Political Control markers in Gallia Cisalpina to seize control of the province.\n6. Cathage has established a foothold in Italy. Now Rome is in danger. Hannibal ante portas!\n20th Anniversary Edition features\nState-of-the-art map board.\nNew card illustrations based on historical sources.\nNew improved layout of the board, charts, and cards. \u201cLearn and Play\u201d playbook. Read a few pages, than play a scenario before moving forward.\n20 years of game development in a single box: includes 13 historical scenarios (e.g. First Punic War 264-241 B.C., Second Punic War 218-201 B.C., Post Cannae 215-201 B.C., Iberia 210-205 B.C., Italy 207-204 B.C., Africa 204-201 B.C.), and tutorial scenarios!\nLong-awaited HAMILCAR companion game. New map, strategy cards and leaders. And a handful of exciting new mechanics.\nLarge, 40 mm scale plastic leader miniatures in 16 different sculpts! Based on 7 mm tall and 25 mm wide round bases (with leader ratings), in red for Rome and blue for Carthage.\nPledge levels\nEach of these pledge levels includes the complete game, two Kickstarter Special Expansions, and any additional content we may generate during the campaign.

Here are some reviews of this all-time classic.\nVideo reviews\nWritten reviews\n\"If you like card driven games, and you've never tried Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage, drop whatever it is you're doing right now and go get a copy. You won't regret it. If you like wargames in general, at the very least give this game a try... it might surprise you. If you're a euro player looking for a new introduction to wargaming, you couldn't find a better spot to jump in with both feet. I have played a fair number of card driven games (and this bears repeating so forgive me), but Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage remains my favorite. Its elegance, simplicity and relatively decent game time makes it the cream of the crop even after all these years. I don't care whether I'm winning or I'm losing (though of course I'd prefer the former), as long as I'm playing. Grab (or try) a copy.\" \n\"This game is exceptional. I love (nearly) everything about it and cannot begin to describe how much fun it is to play. I fear I cannot continue without repeating things I've already mentioned so I'll just leave it at this. Great game, if you can get your hands on it I heartily, heartily recommend you do so.\"\n\"Overall, the gameplay was everything I hoped it would be and more. Sweeping political struggle underpinned by tense tactical battles with varied and subtle consequences, this game really got under my skin in a good way. After 3 plays I think I have barely scratched the surface of this game, and I really look forward to delving deeper.\"\n\"The Art of \u201cCard Driven Game\u201d Design \u2013 Why Hannibal: Rome vs Carthage is the best CDG ever published?\"\nHow to play\nWalk-through videos\nExtended gameplay\n\"It was tightest, closest and most furious game I've ever had. The pendulum of fate swung from one side to another, stopping at the end on Carthaginian side. We both made mistakes and we both experienced how random this game can be but still it was one of best games I've ever played - by this I mean not only games of Hannibal but of all games I've ever played in my life. My rating of Hannibal Rome vs Carthage goes up from 9 to 10 and I could only wish it could further than that.\"\nStrategy tips\nProduction & delivery\nThe games are produced in EU (with miniatures and dice produced in China), keeping the normal high standards of PHALANX.

We cooperate with the largest companies on the market, such as Stonemaier Games, Mayfair Games, KOSMOS, Academy Games, Asyncron games, Ediciones MasQueOca, Feuerland Spiele, and Morning Family. We have already published various games in English, and many people enjoy playing them. 1944: Race to the Rhine was voted one of the best wargames of 2014. Others include The Magnates: A Game of Power, Germania Magna: Border in Flames, and Days of Honor.\nThis project is Kicktraq Day-1 Project.

This year we are excited to expand the Aeon\u2019s End universe with a standalone game compatible with the existing world. If you aren\u2019t familiar with Aeon\u2019s End, you can check out the BGG page, watch The Dice Tower review where it was given the Seal of Excellence or the \"Watch It Played\" video tutorial.\nGravehold remains the last bastion of The World That Was. As the otherworldly incursions from the creatures known only as The Nameless intensify, a cadre of strange survivors emerge from the void itself. Will they be Gravehold's salvation or its undoing?  \nWar Eternal is a standalone game compatible with the hit cooperative deck building game Aeon's End. Players will struggle to defend Gravehold from The Nameless and their hordes using unique abilities, powerful spells, and an all new cast of dynamic characters. Featuring a number of innovative mechanisms, including a variable turn order system that simulates the chaos of an attack and deck management rules that require careful planning, War Eternal can be played alone or combined with other Aeon's End content for a game experience like no other. \nClick here to read Aeon's End designer, Kevin Riley explain the new LINK mechanic.\n          Man vs Meeple's review and developer interview:\n  Rahdo Runs Through review:\nBower's Game Corner: Aeon's End: War Eternal Review:\n Two Bats Aeon's End: War Eternal Review:\n    Backers that would like to further enhance their game play experience can add $20 to the pledge level of their choosing to receive the Accessory Pack. \nThe Accessory pack includes:\n124 Player cards - enough cards to have a unique set of starter cards for each mage included in War Eternal, Aeons End, and all the expansions/stretch goals for these two projects. \n24 Player Dividers - Dividers for each Mage's starting deck. \n10 Translucent d10s - Life Counters for each Mage, and extras for Minions. \n 24 Translucent Charge tokens - \"Gems\" used to track charges on Player mats. \n12 Translucent Power tokens - \"Gems\" used to track Player abilities. \n10 Translucent Nemesis tokens - \"Gems\" used to track Nemesis abilities.\nThese accessories make the game easier to store, set-up and play, and even more visually appealing.\nWith the new graphic design of Aeon's End, we are offering updated player cards, nemesis cards, and player mats to backers who already own the original release. We are not changing card backs, so those who prefer to not update their cards may continue to enjoy their existing games and expansions with new expansion materials across the different editions without using the Update Pack. \nIf you backed or preordered Aeon\u2019s End directly, and you back War Eternal: You will automatically be sent the Update Pack (for Aeon\u2019s End, Depths & Nameless) with your War Eternal rewards for no extra charge.\nIf you back War Eternal, and you purchased Aeon\u2019s End, Depths and/or Nameless elsewhere: You will be able to get the Update Pack for what you\u2019ve already purchased by adding $10 to your pledge amount (includes shipping costs worldwide). We will require photographic proof of purchase (a picture of your Kickstarter username on post-it note attached to the game box and/or nemesis mats). Your Update Pack will include cards and Player Mats for Aeon\u2019s End and the expansions you\u2019ve purchased.\nA limited number of Update Packs will also be available directly from Indie Boards and Cards in the late fall of 2017. Those update packs will be $10 plus shipping & handling, and will require photographic proof of purchase.\n Player Mat\nThis player mat isn\u2019t necessary \u2013 but it is very functional! If you want the player mat sent with your rewards, add $25 to your pledge. You can add more than one copy.\nNew Games from Indie Boards and Cards\n In addition to War Eternal, we are planning on releasing two new games at GenCon this year. Both of these games are in a similar vein as Coup; light, fun, high player interaction, and definitely more strategy to them than is apparent on the first play.\nClick here for the rules for Pirate 21.\nClick here for the rules to Witching Hour.\nPirate 21, by Jeremy Commandeur & Franklin Kenter, is a trash talking, special power using, and deductive (but no bluffing) variation of 21 for 2 to 6 players. It\u2019s a game that we first played at BGG Con in 2015 and have been tweaking it since then. If you want Pirate 21, add $10 to your pledge amount. You can add more than one copy.\nWitching Hour, by first time designer Bruce Baskir, is a very clever hand management game for 2 to 5 players that we first played at Geekway 2016 and have been playing and thinking about it ever since. If you want Witching Hour, add $10 to your pledge amount. You can add more than one copy.\nExtra copies of rewards\nWe know that some backers want more than one copy of a reward level. To do this, you will need to 1) pledge at the highest level from which you want the rewards, and 2) add to your pledge amount based on the chart below. The numbers in the two leftmost columns in chart below are inclusive of shipping (ie, you don\u2019t have to add shipping cost for each item, just the first which Kickstarter does automatically).\nPledge Manager\nIt is important that everyone knows that we are not using a pledge manager. That means you\u2019ll have to add to your pledge amount for all the add-ons that you want, before the project is completed at 10pm pacific, April 20th. To change you pledge amount, click the \u201cManage your Pledge\u201d button on the top of this page.\n Then click \u201cChange your Pledge\u201d, enter the new pledge amount and click \u201cContinue\u201d. The tricky part is that you\u2019ll need to calculate the total pledge amount on your own (see details below to help) and won\u2019t get an immediate confirmation of what you have added. This has to be done before the project ends (10pm pacific, Thursday April 20th). We will get all the details we need from you when we send the project surveys out, that will be done the week of April 24th (we need to get the information quickly in order to send the right number of games and add-ons to their fulfillment centers).\nExamples:\nExample 1 \u2013 US backer wants Enlightened Exile ($65), Accessory Pack, Update Pack & Witching Hour:\nSelect the $65 pledge level and change the pledge amount to $109 - $65 pledge level, $20 Accessory Pack, $10 Update Pack, $14 Witching Hour. Note the Update Pack will require a photographic proof of purchase, see the FAQ for more details.\nExample 2 \u2013 Canadian Backer wants Voidwalker ($130), two Enlighted Exile ($65) and 3 player mats:\nSelect the $130 pledge level and change the pledge amount to $340 - $130 pledge level, $15 shipping, 2x$60 add-on Enlighted Exile (from chart above) and 3x $25 Player Mats.\nNote \u2013 Add-ons are only available at the $65 and higher pledge reward levels. Add-ons are not available on the $1 or no reward levels.\n                                                                                    Note that anything marked with these symbols are:\nPromo - an item that Kickstarter backers (and those signed up to get rewards at Gen Con & Essen) will get in their rewards, and will not be included in the retail edition of Aeon's End: War Eternal or The Void Expansion. These items may be released at a future date as promotional materials and/or game expansions.\nKickstarter Exclusive - an exclusive item for Kickstarter backers (and those signed up to get rewards at Gen Con & Essen), with remaining stock available through conventions and special promotions only. \nAeon\u2019s End: War Eternal is the 36th project from the combined teams behind Indie Boards and Cards & Action Phase Games. With the successful execution of our first 35 projects, we have become experienced publishers with a reputation for great games (in design and production) that are delivered in a timely fashion. \nAeon\u2019s End: War Eternal was designed by the talented Kevin Riley. This game has undergone extensive testing and development to ensure the best possible experience. We are confident that this game will be in your collection for years to come. \nThe original base game Aeon's End received The Dice Tower Seal of Excellence\nAll of the art assets are complete and ready for immediate upload after the project funds. \nPrices include US shipping. This project is also EU & Canadian friendly.\n  Kickstarter is the world's largest funding platform for creative projects. Every month, tens of thousands of people pledge millions of dollars to creative projects in dozens of categories.  \nA person who supports a project is called a \"backer.\" The process of giving money to this project is called a \"pledge.\" \nIn return for your pledge, we (the creators of the campaign) are able to offer \"rewards,\" depending on the amount you pledge. For example, if you pledge $65 to help back the project, we'll offer you a copy of the game along with any stretch goals we achieve as soon as it is manufactured. \nYou can become a backer in just three easy steps: \nStep 1: Read through the pledge levels and rewards we're offering in the right sidebar of this page. \nStep 2: Click the large, green \"BACK THIS PROJECT\" button to the right of the trailer video at the top of this page. \nStep 3: Enter your pledge amount, and complete the steps for filling in your information. This process takes just a few seconds! That's it! It's really that simple! Thank you for backing! \nOnce you've backed this project, we encourage you to share this page on social media platforms, such as Facebook and Twitter, and share with your friends and family.

For additional copies in the US and international, check our rates below.\n    Our plan is to have Aeon\u2019s End: War Eternal available at Gen Con. While our current production schedule looks like Kickstarter rewards will ship out before Gen Con, it may be the case that we have games at Gen Con before the Kickstarter backer copies are sent. It may also be the case that we are unable to get games to Gen Con in time. I wish we were able to absolutely guarantee results, but we simply know that we can't make such commitments when so many other parties are involved in the process.  \nIf you want Gen Con or Essen pickup \u2013 DO NOT PLEDGE FOR THIS PROJECT \u2013 all you have to do is sign up for our Gen Con email list by giving an email address here or the Essen email list by giving an email address here. Shortly before each event, we will ask you what you would like to reserve for Thursday pickup (NOTE: we cannot handle prepaid reservations or hold items past Thursday). \nAll the stretch goals will be available in the games we bring to Gen Con and Essen \u2013 your support is very valuable to Indie Boards and Cards & Action Phase Games and we look forward to seeing you again this year with lots of great new games. \n                                   ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is the 36th Kickstarter project from the combined teams behind Indie Boards and Cards & Action Phase Games. We have learned how to streamline the game publishing process and have successfully delivered all of our previous Kickstarter projects to thousands of supporters. Our previous experiences will enable us to also deliver this project on time and we have every confidence that Aeon\u2019s End: War Eternal will be on schedule and of the highest possible quality.\n\nThat said, there are always complexities and considerations in a project of this scope that may cause delays. Indie Boards and Cards & Action Phase Games will use contract manufacturing to make this game, freight forwarders to get games through customs, and 3rd parties like Amazon, the US Post Office, and FEDEX to ship the games to you \u2013 we don't control everything and there are lots of opportunities for delay. We have a track record of making everything work out for backers in the end \u2013 so please be confident and supportive of our efforts to get this great game into your hands.\n\nThe component quality of Aeon's End was lacking in a couple of places. We are working hand-in-hand with the factory to make sure that these issues are addressed. We've expressed concern with them that the cards must be aligned better, the dials must be tighter, and some of the components must be thicker. We are confident we will be able to deliver a final product for War Eternal that is more in line with our, and your, expectations.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nWe can refund you within 14 days of the campaign\u2019s end, fees included. After that, we have a policy of no questions asked, though that\u2019s minus 20% for Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we can\u2019t get back from them after 14 days). However, if we\u2019ve begun packaging your pledge for shipment (usually 4 to 6 weeks before the actual shipping date), no refunds are possible. If a component cannot be delivered AT ALL, we refund that completely, including fees.\n\nAll refunds after the 14 days close of the campaign may be processed via PayPal or reversed via Stripe to your credit card at our discretion. Refunds within 14 days are reversed via Stripe to your credit card.\n\nThis project is being funded in USD and any refunds processed will be in USD for the exact amount received in USD, excluding any applicable fees depending on the time of the refund being processed.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look, materials, and content of the rewards (and the project) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented while the Kickstarter project was active.\n\nIf you do not log in and submit your project survey results (ie, provide us with your shipping address) for your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received. However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your pledge (at additional cost for international backers) if you complete your project survey after the 8-week window has elapsed.\n\nIf you do not accept these terms, please do not pledge on this project but instead wait for the general release.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Survivor", "descp": "Your continued support will help Gravehold to endure.\nNote - this reward level is not eligible to receive the Update Pack, nor the Accessory Pack", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Aug 2017"}], "stat": ["106 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 65 or more", "title": "Enlightened Exile", "descp": "One copy of War Eternal and The Void expansion with all stretch goals.\nBackers of the Aeon's End 2016 Kickstarter will also receive the Update Pack.

Hunt", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "A holy knight, a defender of the realm and its people, an example of nobility, strenth and resilience - the Paladin. A name that sets a new industry standard for all who love their games and believe the best possible protection from damage and wear.\nPaladin Card Protection was established by and experienced team of designers and publishers, but - first and foremost - passionate fans of tabletop games. We believe that our desire to preserve the games we play for years is shared by true gamers around the world.\n    There are at least three great reasons to choose Paladin as your brand of card sleeves:\n1. Our card protectors are extremely durable. With a thickness of 90 microns, Paladin Card Protectors will prevail in the harshest gaming conditions, while still keeping the the combined height of sleeved decks reasonable.\n2. State of the art manufacturing technology ensures the highest clarity standards. Paladin Card Protectors are acid and PVC free, which means they are not only tough and safe to use, but they also allow you to fully enjoy the cards you protect.\n3. Paladin Card Protectors come in packs of 55. This ensures that you will never have to buy one extra packet just to sleeve those extra 5 cards that come with the game \u2013 or the 2 extra cards you need to add to your customizable, collectible or trading card game tournament deck.\nGet the Paladin to knock on your door! Pledging for Paladin Card Protectors now also means free shipping worldwide, and a friendly shipping structure that allows most backers to avoid unnecessary customs fees.\nPaladin Card Protectors can take a lot of abuse, while still leaving your cards pristine. How much abuse exactly? Just check the videos below to see:\n And how does a Paladin fare against a blade?\nAnd how does the Paladin fare against careless sleeving and hot water?\nDo you have more ideas for sleeve abuse? Share them in the comments!\n          We know much about gamer needs! Cards for most modern board games are printed on sheets of 110 cards each (which can be easily divided into two 55-card decks). This is why so many designer board games come with a number of cards that is a multiple of 55 \u2013 and this is also the reason why Paladin Card Protectors also come in packs of 55.\n  If your gaming collection spans over multiple card games, we know you buy card sleeves in bulk. With Paladin Card Protectors, you will always have what you need to sleeve the odd 5 cards left out by other sleeve manufacturers!\nAll can benefit from the Paladin's shield. Paladin Card Protectors come in five different sizes: CCG, Standard American, Standard European, Mini American and Mini European. Below you\u2019ll see just a few of the games that the Paladin can protect for you.\nYou can see below a more comprehensive list, but there are still so many board and cards games which are not listed.\nIf you are looking for an even more comprehensive list, you can check this page. \nThe pledge level structure is as clear as Paladin Card Protectors: simply choose a pledge level with the number of card packs you want to receive. After the campaign is over, you will be asked to provide us specifications for each ordered card pack via a pledge manager, which will allow you to choose desired sizes of cards. You will be able to mix and match however you want!\n  Paladin Card Protectors will be manufactured in China by one of the leading companies making card sleeves. Some of the established brands on the market are using the same factory, one which has more than 10 years experience in manufacturing plastic products.\nProduction will take place under our direct supervision, following all the quality standards we promise to abide to in this campaign. As always, when we manufacture overseas, we will be present on site for quality check and final delivery of the sleeves.\nAfter the end of this campaign, we will open a pledge manager, where you will be able to complete your order by choosing the sizes of Paladin Card Protectors you need and desire.\nWe estimate that production will be over at the end of June and we will be able to start shipping in July. Since all rewards are shipped out from Poland, we estimated that most backers will receive rewards in August, while some distant regions might have to wait until September or October.\nFree shipping worldwide\n All rewards are sent out from Poland. Depending on your pledge level, you will receive your reward either in a cardboard box or in a heavy-duty bubble protected envelope. We are using the services of our local post, which has a delivery rate of 99.5% (from our direct experience). Most packages will come without a tracking number, as we will use the economy option. This is how we are able to offer free shipping to absoluetly everyone!\nPaladin was created by a team of passionate gamers and game design and publishing specialists, working (and playing games together!) for NSKN Games and Strawberry Studio. As gamers, we wanted to create the perfect type of sleeve: offering high level of protection, while having a minimum influence on your gaming experience.\nThe Paladin Card Protectors are 90 microns thick. This means, that they are thicker than most of the popular brands\u2019 Premium sleeves. We offer extremely high durability, and a level of protection that keeps your cards away from harm in any gaming situation.\nWe chose the thickness of 90 microns to maximize binding, making Paladin Card protectors almost unbreakable, while your cards stay well protected, for an affordable price.\nAre there thicker sleeves on the market? Yes. You can buy sleeves that are 100, 106 or even 125 microns thick. However, we have decided to pick the perfect compromise between protection and influencing your gaming experience. 90 microns already offer perfectly solid protection, while still making a sleeved deck manageable. Simply put, with thicker sleeves the decks spill over your gaming table much too easily to be used comfortably.\nFinally, we wanted sleeves that are clear and safe to use. No PVC or acid is an industry standard which we adhere to. Furthermore, we have personally made sure that the materials used guarantee the highest level of clarity, so that you can enjoy the cards you choose to protect the way they you want to enjoy them: in full, vivid and unmodified color and sharpness.\n   ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nPaladin Card Protection is a new project of a team of specialists experienced in the fields of manufacturing tabletop gaming materials and wordwide shipping. \n\nWith 9 highly successful board game Kickstarter Projects under the NSKN Games brand, each delivered with minimal or no delay, we know exactly how to effectively manage multiple orders from around the world, so that pledges reach our backers on time.\n\nTo ensure the highest quality of our product and a smooth delivery, we have personally visited the production facilities in China (with more details available in Update 2), which allows us to realistically assess the time and effort needed to manufacture and deliver Paladin Card Protectors in a timely manner.\n\nKnowing that the unexpected may still happen, we are accounting for possible delays at every step of production and fulfillment, making sure that if something does no go exactly as planned, we will have enough spare time to still stay within the project deadlines.\n\nWe have many contingencies in place, and with the wealth of previous experiences we are confident that even if a delay actually happens, it will not be longer than 14 days.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 13 or more", "title": "6-Pack", "descp": "6 Packs of 55 Paladin Card Protectors.\nFree shipping worldwide.\nINCLUDES:\n330 card protectors", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["243 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 21 or more", "title": "10-Pack", "descp": "10 Packs of 55 Paladin Card Protectors.\nFree shipping worldwide.\nINCLUDES:\n550 card protectors", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["194 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 28 or more", "title": "14-Pack", "descp": "14 Packs of 55 Paladin Card Protectors.\nFree shipping worldwide.\nINCLUDES:\n770 card protectors", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["194 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 38 or more", "title": "20-Pack", "descp": "20 Packs of 55 Paladin Card Protectors.\nFree shipping worldwide.\nINCLUDES:\n1100 card protectors", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["214 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 50 or more", "title": "30-Pack", "descp": "30 Packs of 55 Paladin Card Protectors.\nFree shipping worldwide.\nINCLUDES:\n1650 card protectors", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["297 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 65 or more", "title": "40-Pack", "descp": "40 Packs of Paladin Card Protectors.\nFree shipping worldwide.\nINCLUDES:\n2200 card protectors", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["210 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 95 or more", "title": "60-Pack", "descp": "60 Packs of Paladin Card Protectors.\nFree shipping worldwide.\nINCLUDES:\n3300 card protectors", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["152 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 145 or more", "title": "100-Pack", "descp": "100 Packs of Paladin Card Protectors.\nFree shipping worldwide.\nINCLUDES:\n5500 card protectors", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["156 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 200 or more", "title": "150-Pack", "descp": "150 Packs of Paladin Card Protectors.\nFree shipping worldwide.\nINCLUDES:\n8250 card protectors", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["42 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 250 or more", "title": "200-Pack", "descp": "200 Packs of Paladin Card Protectors.\nFree shipping worldwide.\nINCLUDES:\n11000 card protectors", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["39 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 350 or more", "title": "300-Pack", "descp": "300 Packs of Paladin Card Protectors.\nFree shipping worldwide.\nINCLUDES:\n16500 card protectors", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["86 backers"]}], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #49", "update_userinfo": "Paladin Card Protection Season 3 is live on Kickstarter!", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #48", "update_userinfo": "Paladin Season 3 is coming - tell us what you need!", "update_content": "Ladies and Gentlemen! \nIt is true!

Glossy, polyurethane coated floors and cabinets make this the wood of the people. It\u2019s popularity is well earned \u2013 it\u2019s handsome and works easily. While not currently in vogue in kitchen decor, it\u2019s doubtful we\u2019ve heard the last from this classic.\n      Cherry is one of the few woods that one may wish to leave in the sunshine to darken, perhaps on a windowsill for a few days. It will shift from a pale, pinkish red to a deep, warm, reddish brown. This color change is initially rapid, visible day to day, but slows gradually. Like most fruit woods, cherry works easily, and can feature vivid grain. A classic, tasteful American wood for furniture and paneling.\nWalnut comes in many varieties, but American black walnut is the most ubiquitous. An exceedingly popular fine furniture wood, it is light, beautiful, and works easily. Wide, flat-sawn boards can have brilliant figure and cathedrals, making excellent dining room table tops \u2013 perfect for gaming! A perennial favorite, and a truly refined classic.\nHailing from Central Africa, this dark grainy wood is strong, hard, dense, and stable. While it does not possess the pure black of Gabon ebony, wenge is nonetheless among the darkest natural woods to be found anywhere. Exotic and striking, it is very popular in decorative usage for its unique, wild look and distinctive character.\nExtremely popular and sought after, rosewood is the quintessential wood for inlay, turnings, carvings and many musical instruments. Very hard, fine-grained, and crisp, there are many varieties of rosewood, some sold under other names. All of them take a beautiful polish and are considered fine tonal woods. Unquestionably one of the finest woods we offer, rosewood speaks of refinement and grace.\n  Purpleheart is a very hard, dense wood, primarily known for its remarkable coloring. One of our most highly varied woods in hue, it ranges from warm and subtle plum to vivid, cool shades of violet. Over time, the color will mellow to a rich tint. Purpleheart is unmistakable, unique among thousands of wood species, and many collectors count it as a favorite.\nAs we unlock new woods we will list them with their descriptions in this section.  We are currently building GM screens in these woods and final photography for all unlocked woods will be available in BackerKit before you finalize your decision.  Please, let us know if there is a wood you are looking forward to seeing in the comments section.

We maintained open communication throughout, and our backers were very pleased - some calling it the best campaign of which they'd ever been a part.

A Spanish Galleon floats nearby, and you\u2019ve talked your crewmates into working together to steal all of its treasure. What you haven\u2019t told your fellow pirates is that you have no intentions on sharing the treasure once you have it. Your crewmates have told you that they share your loyalty and that they\u2019ll help you maroon the greedy pirates on your ship to the rocky island of Tortuga. But you\u2019ve seen your friends\u2019 loaded pistols and heard their whisperings of a mutiny. You know that nobody can be trusted.\nFor 2-9 Players. 20-40 minutes. Ages 12+.\n  GAME CONTENTS\n1 Faux book container\n1 Rulebook (includes character biographies)\n64 Cards (9 Brethren of the Coast, 16 Event, 30 Vote, 9 Loyalty)\n1 Rubber playing mat\n1 Burlap pouch\n9 Wooden pawns\n8 Wooden treasure chests\nTHE GAME\nThe game is packaged in a faux book box. The box has 3 magnets to keep it closed when you're moving it to and from game night.\n  The game fits nicely inside the faux book box. The box is big enough for cards to be sleeved, if desired.\n  The game board is a rubber playmat. The board rolls up like a map.\n  The 8 wooden treasure pieces come in a burlap bag.\n  Each of the 9 wooden pawns matches with 1 of the 9 pirates you can be in the game. Each pirate is based on a real pirate who roamed Tortuga and the Caribbean seas in the year 1667.\n     Each player has a secret loyalty: British, Dutch, or French. But be careful who you trust; someone claiming to share your loyalty may stab you in the back and steal your hard-earned treasure.\n  Use Event cards during the game to help your team get treasure, or to maroon members of the opposite team to the island of Tortuga.\n  Use Vote cards during the game to secretly impact Attacks against the Spanish, Mutinies against your Captain, and Brawls against your fellow pirates.\nREWARDS\nWe're not big into confusing reward levels or expensive add-ons. We want each of our backers to get the best reward we can offer: this beautiful game!

But I love this game. -Tessa\nTortuga is a game full of surprises! Each round brings with it new and intriguing events that ultimately make you the master of the sea or scum of Tortuga. It all depends on how proficient you are at finding your team and making that knowledge count. -Alex R.\nI have played this game basically every week for the last couple of months. I have loved it every single time and never been bored. It\u2019s a great game to play with friends and really makes you think. -Abigail S\nI love this game!!! No game is ever the same, and it's always exciting. You never know who is going to do what or if you are trusting the right person. Everyone I have introduced to this game has loved it too. -Alex W.\nTortuga is a great social deduction game and it looks great on your game shelf too! Love the game even though sometimes it makes me question my friends and family. -Brett A.\nA game where I can deceive and be called Captain is a very good game indeed.\" -Derek H.\nTortuga is unique in the fact that it allows the perfect amount of deception for those that enjoy tricking and deceiving others, but it also provides the opportunity to work off of pure logic and reason for the other players that do not particularly excel in manipulation. I have had the opportunity of playing this game numerous times with many different crowds, and every game is completely different because of the different strategies and techniques that people can utilize. -Levi H.\nPRESS\nDice Tower News: http://www.dicetowernews.com/facade-games-welcomes-you-to-tortuga-1667-on-kickstarter/35996\nGeek & Sundry: http://geekandsundry.com/tortuga-1667-kickstarter-brings-treacherous-pirates-to-tabletop-gaming/\nCwowd.com (French): http://www.cwowd.com/tortuga-cap-sur-bonne-esperance/\nBeasts of War: http://www.beastsofwar.com/tortuga-1667/command-ship-secure-treasure-tortuga-1667-ks/ \nViva Veltoro: http://www.vivaveltoro.com/2017/02/tortuga-1667-pirate-game.html\nTabletop Gaming: https://www.tabletopgaming.co.uk/board-games/news/tortuga-1667-is-a-gorgeous-social-deception-game-with-pirates \nDDO Players: http://ddoplayers.com/2017/01/22/tortuga-1667-a-pirate-game-on-kickstarter/\nClub Fantasci: http://www.clubfantasci.com/kickstarter-week-tortuga-1667/\nBoard Game Stories: http://boardgamestories.com/news/party/no-pirate-trusted-tortuga-1667/\nIf you have an article about Tortuga 1667 or this project, please message us so we can have it featured here.

Complete rules, including tips & tricks, rule clarifications, advanced optional rules, event card descriptions, and character biographies are not shown in the video, but are all included in the game rulebook. If you'd like to look at the complete rules now please visit the links below: \nEnglish \nFrench\nGerman\nSpanish \nDutch\nItalian\nPortuguese\nHungarian\nTurkish\nPlay the game as 1 of these 9 actual pirates from history. Biographies of each pirate are in the back of the rulebook.\n  Each player has a secret loyalty card. This is your team. Part of the game is deciphering who is your teammate and who is your enemy.\n  The Tortuga playing board. Teams win if they have the most treasure in their team's treasure holds when the Spanish Armada card is revealed.\n  Players choose to perform one action on their turn. One potential action is to reveal one of five available Event cards.\n  Be careful about which Event cards you reveal! Some may maroon you or your teammates to Tortuga.\n  If you reveal one of the three treasure maps, you must give it to someone you trust. If you reveal the Spanish Armada, the game is over.\n  During the game, Captains can call for Attacks, First Mates can call for Mutinies, and the Governor of Tortuga can call for Brawls. When one of these votes is called for, use your Vote cards to secretly cast your vote!\n  Depending on the player count, you'll need to rely more heavily on certain skills to win the game. We love the flexibility and variability of Tortuga 1667 based on the player count!\nTORTUGA CREATION PROCESS\nA great game (in our opinion), needs three things: solid mechanics, an awesome theme, and beautiful design.\n1. Mechanics\nTortuga is all about the interactions you have with the other players. In some cases, such as when you and your shipmates are attacking the Spanish Galleon, you need to rely on your enemies in order to succeed. In the very next turn, however, your shipmates might stab you in the back with a mutiny in order to keep all the treasure for themselves.\nSince nobody holds a \"hand\" of cards, this game is also about knowledge and communication regarding the community Event cards. Unless you are in desperation mode, it is not wise to reveal Event cards at random. Almost half of the Event cards can hurt your team drastically. It's often in your best interest to use an action to view the cards first, or to rely on the knowledge of a trusted ally. Knowing where harmful Event cards are located allows you to force an enemy to reveal those cards and suffer the consequences. The most successful players are the ones who are able to discern who is on their team and then share vital information with them at opportune moments.\nVote cards also play a key role in the game. Each Vote card has three sections - one each for Attacks, Mutinies, and Brawls. Players must put themselves in the best position to use their Vote cards, since their hand of Vote cards may not always be ideal based on their pawn location. For example, sometimes it may be worth putting in Water, causing an attack to fail, in order to save a Crossbones card for when you want to Mutiny against your captain.\nA game in progress.\n  2. Theme\nTortuga, a small island off of Haiti, was an important pirate settlement and hideout during the golden age of piracy. British, French, and Dutch pirates lived together on the island in a loose alliance and formed a pirate government known as \u201cThe Brethren of the Coast.\u201d Rich from its support of piracy and protected by the Brethren, Tortuga was full of taverns, gambling houses, and prostitutes.\nThe French and British governments, in an attempt to weaken the mighty Spanish, would often legalize piracy by giving pirates letters of marque. These gave pirates permission to unofficially plunder Spanish ships and towns. Many of the pirates on Tortuga chose the privateering life over full-blown piracy, which was illegal. Loyalty to country was fleeting, though, and pirates often walked the line between patriotism and rebellion.\nTortuga 1667 aims to capture the atmosphere of these loose alliances and shifting political loyalties.\nAll parts of the game were designed to bring the players into the canvas, wooden planks, and golden treasure world of the 1667 pirates!\n3. Design\nThe illustrations from Sarah Keele and graphic design from Holly Hancock take players deep into the world of privateers and pirate life. We used textures consistent to what pirates would see on an everyday basis: wooden planks and tables, canvas sails, and weather-torn maps.\nAll pieces of the game were carefully chosen for their color and aesthetic contributions to the theme. The burlap bag conjures images of a pirate's bag of possessions. Many of the cards use a canvas background like the sails on a ship. The playmat rolls out and looks just like an old treasure map. The faux book is worn and colored a piratey brown, dark maroon, and black.\nSome of Sarah's initial sketches and process for creating the beautiful illustrations in the game.\nSTRETCH GOALS\nBecause we've reached the following milestones, we will be adding 8 \"game-changer\" cards to every copy of the game! When setting up, players will add 3 of these game-changers into the Event deck. These cards have the potential to turn the tide in your team's favor! Cards will now also all be given a high-quality linen finish, 2 and 3-player setup rules will be added to the rulebook, a \"Captain's Helm\" illustration will be added to the blank Mutiny sections on the Vote cards, 2 \"double-vote\" Vote cards will be added to each copy of the game, a wooden explosion token will be added to each copy of the game, Brethren of the Coast cards will have player action lists on the back of them, the Treasure map will include a compass rose and map legend, and we're adding a Quick-Start/Certified First Edition card to every copy of the game!\n  WHY KICKSTARTER?\nIf we reach our goal, we will be able to pay for the manufacturing and shipping of the first edition of Tortuga 1667. We already have our manufacturers lined up and ready to go! As you can see from our photos, samples of the game have already been produced and designs are complete. We just need to raise the funds and say go!\nWe fell in love with the Kickstarter community when we launched our last game, Salem. The feedback, support, trust, and positivity from the community was incredible. We're proud to reward our Kickstarter backers with discounts on the game, first-in-line knowledge and insight into the project, and a direct line of communication to us as the creators. We consider each Kickstarter backer to be a close ally in our game-making endeavors.\nTHE DARK CITIES SERIES\nTortuga 1667 is Volume 1 in Facade Games' Dark Cities Series!

The game has now sold over 10,000 copies and is played around the world. \n\nWe are extremely proud to have delivered Salem on time to our backers! Here's what one of our backers had to say: \n\nI have backed over 46 projects and I just wanted to say this project has been an absolute delight to have been a backer for. Your updates have been insightful, but not overbearing. You clearly put a lot of time, thought, and effort into this game and it really shows. I was impressed with how fast this project came together. It was a fast, well organized campaign. Kudos to you and thank you for a wonderful end product. I couldn't be happier. -Snuffles00\n\nSalem's Kickstarter Page\nSalem's Store Page\nSalem's Amazon Page (check out the reviews!)\n\nWe've made Salem available as an \"Add-on\" reward for this Kickstarter campaign.

Hit one of the buttons below and tag a friend or coworker who can't stop fidgeting!\n        How do I use it?\nIt's simple. Fidget Cube (patent pending) has six sides. Each side features something to fidget with:\n              Fidgeting that matches your style.\nFidget Cube is available in 10 different color schemes:\nDice, Graphite, Midnight, Aqua, Sunset, Berry, Fresh, Retro, Kickstarter Edition, and Backer Designed (design voted on by the Fidget Family!).\n            Why fidget?\nWe love this question. It's not uncommon to hear fidgeting being spoken about negatively. It's often labeled as unprofessional and deemed as anti-intellectual behavior.\nBut in reality, the exact opposite has been suggested to be the case. Below are just some of many resources highlighting the work that's being done to learn more about this behavior:\nThe Science Of Why We Fidget While We Work\nSquirm With Purpose\nStress Toys: Mindlessness With A Purpose?\nThe Benefits Of Fidgeting For Students With ADHD\nWhy Do We Fidget?\nUsing Stress Balls To Focus The Attention Of Students\nWe believe that the way we look at fidgeting needs to change.\nThis behavior isn't one that should continue to be stigmatized and mocked as unbecoming or inappropriate. We are passionate about the idea that fidgeting is a process that, with the right tools and outlet, can have positive and real-life applications.\n  Where can I use Fidget Cube?\n  It was incredibly important to us that the design of Fidget Cube was one that would look great on any desk, whether that desk belonged to a student or a CEO.\nThere are really no limits to when and where you can use Fidget Cube. Use it while listening to a lecture, or while studying for that upcoming test. Use it in the next meeting you have to attend (or lead). Use it at your desk while working on projects. Enduring a lengthy commute and need to relieve some stress? Fidget away. Marathoning a Netflix series? Yep, you can fidget then too.\n  But I already have a pen. Do I really need Fidget Cube?\nPens (and the wonderful clicking they do) were a huge inspiration in the design process of Fidget Cube. They are probably one of the most commonly used fidget \"tools\". We like to see Fidget Cube as more of a fidget \"toolbox\". You don't have to be constrained to simple clicking, you can pick your poison based on your mood. Yes... We are very serious about our fidgeting.\n  I don't really fidget. Would I enjoy Fidget Cube?\nWe think so! Not everyone fidgets the same amount. But spending the last few years deeply interested in the process of fidgeting, we've observed the fact that almost everyone fidgets to some extent, in a variety of ways.\nMaybe you're not the type of person who uses objects like paper clips or pencils to fidget with. If that's the case, it's very likely you fidget in some other way, such as bouncing your knee up and down, tapping your foot, or picking at lint in your pocket.\nWe believe that Fidget Cube provides a tangible way to capture your floating attention, regardless of whether you fidget consciously or subconsciously.\n  Rewards.\nFor believing in our vision, we want to thank you! Check out our rewards below:\n    Stretch Goals.\n         The Team.\n  We're Antsy Labs, and more specifically, Matthew and Mark McLachlan - brothers that have a passion for designing solutions to problems we come across in daily life.\nWhere are you in the process?\nAfter handfuls of prototypes, we've tweaked every last detail to arrive at the Fidget Cube you see today. We've got a number of working units, but in order to make enough for you to have one as well, we need to place a substantial minimum order for the first production run of Fidget Cube. That's why we're offering Fidget Cube to this awesome community before anyone else.\nWhat does your timeline look like?\nFidget Cube has been an idea we've been dying to bring to fruition since it was first conceived in 2012. The product you're seeing in this project is the result of innumerable hours of iterating and reiterating. We're perfectionists, and we wanted to make sure we got this one right.\nBelow, you'll see a brief outline of the journey we're on with Fidget Cube, starting from the first discussion about it to when all of you joined the story (and where we go from here)!\nWe are insanely excited to get Fidget Cube into your hands. So you can be sure that we're going to continue to work day and night until the very last Fidget Cube has shipped.\n  Help Out By Sharing Fidget Cube With Your Friends! (#fidgetfever)\nLike what you're seeing? Great! Don't be shy about sharing Fidget Cube with your friends. We've made it super easy. Just hit one of the buttons below (or at the top of the page).\nThe more people who know about Fidget Cube, the larger our community will become! And the larger the community, the better we'll be able to make Fidget Cube!\nWe can't do this without you!\n        Questions?\nAsk away! Shoot us a message or post a comment and we'll do our best to get back to you with an answer.\nFeedback?\nGot a creative idea you think we should implement with Fidget Cube? Don't hesitate - let us know! Fidget Cube is being made possible by you, and we want you to be a part of the creative process as well.\nInternational Backers\nThis project isn't just for backers in the United States. We'll be shipping Fidget Cube worldwide!\nThat being said, there are unique processes that apply specifically to international backers that we'd like you to be aware of. Please note that there is no way for us to charge any additional amount on our end for any applicable VAT/duties that may be a result of a specific country's local tax code. Therefore, these fees may be incurred upon receipt of your reward. These fees are the responsibility of each backer, and additional information regarding VAT/duties can be found in our FAQ below.\nIn addition, due to first class shipping fees and the dimensions of Fidget Cube, shipping rates may seem a bit high for some international locations. We calculated shipping rates beforehand, and are able to swallow some of the shipping costs on orders of 1 or 2 Fidget Cubes. Please note that shipping becomes completely free when you pledge for 5 or more Fidget Cubes.\nSome Final Thoughts.\nWhile we strongly believe in the many benefits of fidgeting, we aren't claiming to cure any illness or condition. Fidget Cube is a fun, unique way to customize your fidgeting. When designing Fidget Cube we were inspired by research that claims fidgeting might actually help individuals focus their attention. We have personally found that it helps us stay focused in boring meetings and while working on projects.\n   ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis isn't our first rodeo. We've brought several Kickstarter projects to life in the past, and have learned from our experiences.

Explore each map, experiencing stories unique to each location.\nStory: Play a series of 3 to 4 games while following your character's main story, making decisions that will affect your ultimate fate.\nShort Mode: Play 1 game of any map you choose, experiencing stories unique to that location.\nArcade Mode: (Stretch Goal) Skip the storybook and use a deck of cards, each with a brief encounter and set of choices.\nHow does this game compare to Above and Below?\nBoth games feature a story book that you read during the game, giving you a choice of how to react to a huge number of situations, people, and creatures. \nIn Near and Far, all of the stories also have a reaction description, filling out the story AFTER you make each choice.  \nSome of the stories are connected in thematic quest lines, so that choices made in an earlier story will affect the outcome and choices of later stories. \nThe story book in Near and Far is at least twice as big as the book in Above and Below. There is a huge world to explore here! \nWhen playing campaign mode, all stories are linked to a location on the map. You'll see something intriguing on the map, travel to that location, and read a story to find out what is there.\nIf you play story mode, you pick one character and play through a focused, connected story line over 4+ games. Early choices you make affect later outcomes in the story! Each character features multiple story paths and endings.\n    Retail Version: The standard retail version of Near and Far will have an MSRP of $59.99. It will include all stretch goals we reach here, but it will not include the metal coins. At conventions, the Deluxe Edition will be priced at $70.00.\nRulebook: Take a look at the prototype rulebook here.   \nChanging Backer Levels: For this project we are unable to change or accept alterations to the backer level rewards. Backers may, however, double their rewards by doubling their pledge amount (for example, $100 for two copies of Near and Far Deluxe, and then add shipping only once). Backers may not triple or quadruple their rewards, etc. \nIt is possible that Near and Far will be printed later by international publishers in various languages. Please take this into consideration when deciding if you would like to pledge. However, we currently do not have plans to license or translate this game.  \nBacker Avatar  \nCan I add Above and Below to my pledge? We are unable to offer Above and Below in this Kickstarter project. Please support your favorite game store and purchase a copy there!\n    Rewards shipping to addresses within the US, EU, and Canada will be shipped from within the US, EU, and Canada.\nInternational Shipping: As per Customs law, we cannot label the game as a gift for shipping. International shipments will be subject to customs charges depending on the country to which you are shipping.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is my twelfth Kickstarter project, and with each project, I could not have printed and produced them without the support of Kickstarter backers.

Because of occasional unforeseen events, it is common for board game production to be delayed. I've done all I can to ensure that this game will be delivered on time if funded. Of course, delays can happen, but most of my projects have been delivered early.\n\nAnother challenge is making sure that all the files and rules are correct when sent to the printer. I've done the graphic design and artwork for many games.

There, the desperate remnants of society have learned that the energy of the very breaches the beings use to attack them can be repurposed through various gems. These gems transform the malign energies within into beneficial spells and weapons to aid their last line of defense: the breach mages.\nAeon's End is a cooperative game that explores the deckbuilding genre with a number of innovative mechanisms, including a variable turn order system that simulates the chaos of an attack, and deck management rules that invite careful planning of every discarded card. Players will struggle to defend Gravehold from The Nameless and their hordes using unique abilities, powerful spells, and, most importantly of all, their collective wits.\nAeon's End is a cooperative deckbuilding game for 1-4 players that plays in 60 minutes. For more information, we encourage you to view the videos below, or simply read our rule book here.\nPromo Content Not In Retail Edition\nThanks to our awesome backers, we have unlocked an incredible amount of additional content. So much so, that we have decided to not include the below stretch goal content in the retail edition, instead saving it for our backers!\nThe Depths expansion\nDeep within the earth, lost in the labyrinth of shadows, the Horde-Crone has awakened the troggs to reclaim the ancient city of Gravehold.\nThe Depths is an expansion for the cooperative deckbuilding game Aeon's End. This expansion features one new nemesis and three new breach mages, as well as new spells, relics, gems, and minions. For more information on the components, please feel free to consult the graphic below.\n        Aeon's End, designed by Kevin Riley, is the eighth project from Action Phase Games. We are experienced publishers, having successfully executed seven previous projects. We are confident we can execute this project to the same high standards.\nKevin Riley has successfully developed several innovations in deckbuilding, while staying in touch with what fans love about this popular mechanic. The game offers a wealth of scalable complexity, content, and tension. Because of these factors, we have every confidence that Aeon's End will be in your collection for years to come. Before designing Aeon's End, Kevin was a full-time professional Starcraft 2 player. His experience playing at the highest level has given him a unique insight into the inner workings of games.\nThe game has been thoroughly developed and play-tested, utilizing over twenty different blind test groups from all over the world.\nAll of the art assets will be 100% complete by the end of the campaign. This means we are ready to upload to the printer and begin manufacturing shortly after the campaign ends. \nThe game features incredible artwork from Gong Studios (Android: Netrunner LCG and Smash Up), set in the post-apocalyptic world of Gravehold, as well as sharp layouts by the very talented Scott Hartman.\nThe game offers a rich and immersive narrative experience full of original and diverse characters and stories. Creating a game that is visibly inclusive in this regard was of the highest importance when developing the game and world.\nThe majority of the stretch goals that have been unlocked will not be included in the retail version of the base game. Check out the section titled \"Promo Content Not in Retail Edition\" above for more info. \nNot only do we offer free shipping in the US, but this project is EU friendly, too.\nKevin has spent thousands of hours carefully designing Aeon's End to address certain issues that he saw as common to the deckbuilding genre. In partnership with Action Phase Games, he developed improvements on existing deckbuilding mechanisms while staying true to what makes deckbuilding popular and exciting.\nSpells and Breaches: In Aeon's End players will defend the ancient city of Gravehold using powerful spells. To cast a spell, players must first prep that spell to a breach. Then, on a later turn, that player may cast the spell to deal its damage. This delay causes tension as you need to have the right spells prepped when your turn comes around in order to defeat the nemesis. In order to prep a spell, players will need to open or focus their breaches. Each player has a specific starting configuration of breaches, most of which start unopened. Players will be able to use aether, the primary resource in the game, to either open a breach permanently, which costs a large amount of aether, or focus a breach for a turn, which costs less.\nTreadmill Mechanic: Unlike other deckbuilders, in Aeon's End players do not shuffle their decks when they need to draw a card from an empty deck. Instead, you just flip over your discard pile when your deck is empty. This allows players to construct specific card combinations, plan better turns, and cooperate more efficiently.\nSmaller Market: Aeon's End uses a fixed market like Dominion, which allows for in depth planning. Unlike Dominion, there are only nine total cards available for purchase each game: three gems, two relics, and four spells. There are only seven copies of each gem (economy cards) and five copies of each relic and spell in the market. This encourages each player to focus on a specific strategy while forcing them to use a different set of cards than the other players.\nVariable Economy: While Dominion has a fixed market of economy cards, Aeon's End features a variable economic market of several gems, three of which will be used each game. This variable market means that each game you will be able to build your deck's economy in a different way.\nNew Ways to Use Resources: There are a number of ways for players to utilize resources outside of those used in traditional deckbuilders. Players will use aether not only to purchase cards from the market, but also to focus and open breaches, discard nemesis cards, and charge special abilities.\nTurn Order Deck: In Aeon's End players will not take turns in a typical clockwise fashion. Instead, the turn order is determined by a deck of six cards. This variable turn order adds tension to the game. \nUnique Player Classes: Each player character has access to their own set of tools: a character-specific starting hand with special card, a unique breach configuration, and a cooperative special ability. Each character has their own strengths and strategies which when used together make powerful combinations.\nEscalating Difficulty Throughout Game: The nemesis deck is divided into three tiers so that as the game progresses the nemesis will become increasingly more challenging. Additionally, each nemesis card is different. The nemesis deck will be composed of several basic nemesis cards as well as nine cards specific to the nemesis for that game. Each nemesis presents the players with a very different experience and adds to the total variability of the game.\nMultiple Ways to Win: Players can win in one of two ways. They can either defeat the nemesis by dealing it damage throughout the course of the game or they can try to stave off the nemesis by surviving every card in its deck. These two ways to win allow players a wider array of strategies to choose from.\nMultiple Ways to Lose: Players will lose if all of them have zero life, or if Gravehold has zero life. Additionally, any given nemesis may also have a unique way that they can win the game.\nKickstarter is the world's largest funding platform for creative projects.

We realize that the publication of a board game can be complicated and, no matter how experienced the project creators and mangers are, some problems may occur. In an effort to reduce the likelihood of delays and mistakes, we have taken several steps to prepare for success:\n\n1. This game project, as well as the Kickstarter campaign itself, are in the hands of two well-seasoned professionals. David MacKenzie has been running Kickstarter projects since 2010 (Alien Frontiers, Sunrise City, Swinging Jivecat Voodoo Lounge, Valeria: Card Kingdoms, ManaSurge), and Isaias Vallejo comes from a digital game background as production and studio director at Big Fish Games and has designed two successful board games: Sunrise City and Valeria: Card Kingdoms.\n\n2. We are dedicated to backer communication and feedback. Throughout the campaign, we will be as transparent about the process and as open to feedback as possible without jeopardizing production and delivery timelines.\n\n3. We have done significant pre-production. All the art and graphic design for Villages of Valeria is completed with the exception of stretch goal content. The art and design for the stretch goal content has been sketched out and is ready to push forward as soon as each goal is achieved.\n\n4. We have our manufacturer lined up and ready to begin the pre-press process as soon as the campaign ends.\n\nWe hope that everything goes as planned, but if something falls through the cracks, we are ready and willing to employ every tool at our disposal to get the project back on track and running smoothly.\n\nThank you for your support!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #61", "update_userinfo": "Shadow Kingdoms of Valeria", "update_content": "Greetings Valerians...\nWe want to let you know about our next Valeria-themed game, but if you no longer want to receive update emails from this project, you can turn off this project's notifications through your Settings // Notifications // Projects You've Backed controls.

Thanks everyone!!!\nAvignon: A Clash of Popes is a quick influence manipulation card game in which the two players are rival candidates for Pope in the 14th century. Players gain influence by petitioning members of the medieval Church, such as Cardinals, Nobles, and Knights, and using the characters' unique powers to pull the character cards over to their side of the table (their congregation), or force an opponent to push cards towards them. The first player to get three characters into their congregation wins.\nAvignon: A Clash of Popes plays in about 15-20 minutes and is suggested for ages 8 and up.\nThe game consists of 12 character cards, 5 map cards, a quick reference card and rules, so it's technically a \"micro game\". It will be packaged in a small vinyl wallet, perfect for taking it on the go. It's pocket-sized, portable and protective... and has proven itself with or growing line of wallet games.\nWant to play right now?\nYou can print the game, even with the tiny amount of ink left in your printer. It's 2 pages and just black ink, with a few red and green icons. You can even just print the whole thing in greyscale. The rules are another few pages, and you can get by without even printing them out and just viewing them online. \nPRINT AND PLAY LINK - https://www.dropbox.com/s/3isfjp6yah0q5i0/AVIGNON-PNP-BW-010516.pdf?dl=0\nPROTOTYPE RULES LINK (Not Final Text or Layout) - https://www.dropbox.com/s/tfhqo4ssndu2wmm/AVIGNON-RULES-010516.pdf?dl=0\nAt Button Shy Games, we've released a handful of wallet games. Each has its own quirky thing going on. You can purchase these today at our website http://www.buttonshygames.com or you can pledge for a package deal here and save money.\nPackage Deal 1 - $17 - Save $3: Avignon plus any one of the following games - Wild Cats, Cunning Folk, Smoke & Mirrors, Fever Chill, North South East Quest or a second copy of Avignon.\nPackage Deal 2 -$24 - Save $6: Avignon plus any two of the following games - Wild Cats, Cunning Folk, Smoke & Mirrors, Fever Chill, North South East Quest or Avignon. NOTE: You can pick multiples of the same game.\nAvignon Special Edition - This version of Avignon comes with a huge playmat, featuring game art and a full map. It's not necessary to play, but it makes for a wonderful game experience for those that want to take it to the next level.\nNote: Package deals will ship with Avignon in March.

You won't see these in your local store on Cool Stuff for cheaper than what you see here. You most likely won't see them at your local store at all. And without Kickstarter funding, you most likely won't see these games in print. \nArt is expensive and we believe in high quality art. Short run games are ridiculously expensive, but for us it's a way to get games into your hands in a reasonable time frame (45 days as opposed to 6 months to a year - or longer!). We're doing this in a way that is different than your standard mass production game. We order in parts and hand assemble the games into wallets. So there is a personal touch to each of these. So thank you for your pledge as it makes every bit of this possible.\nShipping Notes\nShipping is expensive and we apologize. We aren't in the position to pretend like it doesn't exist, or absorb it into the pledges as bigger companies can do. Actually, right after this campaign ends, USPS shipping goes up, AGAIN. The biggest hit is small items - this is exactly what we sell :( - and under 1 lb international is going up over $5 on average. Unfortunately with small games, international shipping can sometimes exceed the cost of the game. \n\"First Class Package International Service postage rates will increase by an average of 21.6% in 2016, however Commercial Base and Plus prices will remain the same next year. The average price increases by pound are:\u2013 Up to 1 lb. \u2013 Average Increase of $5.17\" - USPS.com\nWe know it's an issue and it's just something we have to deal with and a constant struggle. On the other hand, we have an excellent track record for getting our games out on time. Our games ship within 2 months of the end of the Kickstarter, and most likely, even sooner. If shipping seems high, our timelines and package deals should help make up for it.\nShipping costs per pledge level:\nONE GAME: US - $2, CAN - $12, INT - $14\nTWO GAMES - US - $3, CAN - $14, INT - $16\nTHREE GAMES - US - $3, CAN - $14, INT - $16\nTHE AVIGNON SPECIAL EDITION - US - $4, CAN - $14, INT - $20", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe've done our homework and have as much ready as possible before even launching the Kickstarter, but there are always challenges once it's completed.

Because of all the amazing support of backers on Kickstarter, I was able to print and produce my other game designs, including:\nEmpires of the Void\nCity of Iron\nEight-Minute Empire\nEight-Minute Empire: Legends\nCity of Iron: Experts and Engines\nThe Ancient World\nEight-Minute Empire: Lost Lands\nArtifacts, Inc.\nAbove and Below\n Rahdo Runthrough\nSee extended gameplay here.\nSee final thoughts here.\n2-4 Players, 90 Minutes, Age 13+\nRulebook\nTake a look at the prototype rulebook here.  \nMSRP\nThe suggested MSRP for the standard, retail version of the game will be $49.99. The standard, retail version will not include stretch goals (except where noted).  The planned suggested MSRP for the Metropolis Expansion will be $15.00.\nChanging Backer Rewards\nFor this project we are unable to change or accept alterations to the backer level rewards (backers may, however, add one extra copy of the game for $44).  There is no additional shipping cost for this extra copy.\nAdding Copies\nThe limit for adding copies to your reward level is 1 copy. So in total, the maximum amount of copies per backer would be 2 copies.  There is no additional shipping cost for the extra copy.  The two games must go to the same address.  You must add $44 to your pledge for this additional copy.  We are unable to ship more than two copies per backer.\nShipping \nInternational Shipping: As per Customs law, we cannot label the game as a gift for shipping. \nThis will be shipped to EU addresses from within the EU. \nInternational shipments will be subject to customs charges depending on the country to which you are shipping. \nIt is likely that Islebound will be printed later by local publishers in French, German, and possibly other European languages. Please take this into consideration when deciding if you would like to pledge. \n Backer Avatar  ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is my eleventh Kickstarter project, and with each project, I could not have printed and produced them without the support of Kickstarter backers. Islebound has been tested and tweaked to get the balance right. Much of the art is finished and the game is ready, but it won't see the light of day without the funds needed to see that the game is printed.\n\nThere are many other challenges to making sure this project is successful. Because of occasional unforeseen events, it is common for board game production to be delayed. I've done all I can to ensure that this game will be delivered on time if funded. Of course, delays can happen, but most of my projects have been delivered early.\n\nAnother challenge is making sure that all the files and rules are correct when sent to the printer. I've done the graphic design and artwork for many games. My experience helps me ensure a smooth pre-production process.\n\nWith your help, we can have the funds to print the game, overcome the various obstacles that are in the way, and make sure you are delivered a quality product.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #11", "update_userinfo": "European Shipping, Deep Fog, and Near and Far", "update_content": "Hey, it's Brenna again.

We don't use a pledge manager\u2014backers may NOT increase their pledge or add on more items at the KS prices after the campaign ends. Future pre-orders and add-ons can be made on our website.\nDesigned by Jamey Stegmaier (Viticulture & Euphoria) and based on the art and worldbuilding of Jakub Rozalski, Scythe is a 4x game (explore, expand, exploit, exterminate) set in an alternate-history, 1920s Eastern Europe. Scythe tells the stories of 5 factions competing over an unclaimed patch of land surrounding the mysterious Factory.\nDuring Scythe's 750+ blind playtests, the playtesters consistently said they most enjoyed:\nthe dual benefits of the upgrade system (increase an action benefit and decrease a cost)\nthe distinctly different faction and mech abilities\nthe thematic choices presented by the encounter cards\nthe asymmetry and variability created by random pairings of faction and player mats\nthe twist to area control due to all resources being kept on the board\nCheck out the Scythe rules and playtest print-and-play files to see how Scythe blends an engine-building system inspired by Terra Mystica with a deterministic combat system influenced by Kemet. Renders of the 25 miniatures in Scythe are below the \"What's in the Box?\" image.\nTo add items onto your pledge, manually add the $ amount during the project. We don't use a pledge manager, so all pledges must be made in full by November 5. You can mix and match up to 3 total games (any version) and any number of add-ons. On the post-project survey, you will tell us the various items that comprise your pledge.\nEach player is represented on the board by a character and their animal companion (1 miniature). Each character miniature has a 25mm base and a height of 36-58mm.\nEach faction has 4 mechs in their faction color that can be deployed during the game. Each mech miniature has a 30mm base and a height of 26-36mm.\nThis is an example of a faction mat (the Rusviet faction). This shows your faction's special ability, starting military strength, mech abilities, and one-time recruit benefits.\n                                                                                                                                                        This is an example of a player mat (\"Patriotic\"). Each player mat is divided into four sections, each with a top-row action and a bottom-row action. Your actions improve as you build your economic engine.\nThe highly detailed game board for Scythe (full board on left, sample territory on right) depicts the areas near the mysterious Factory. This is a fully-formed world with a specific story, so the board is not modular (see FAQ for more details).\n                                             All promo items are included in every Kickstarter game for free and will be available for additional cost post-Kickstarter (there is no Kickstarter-exclusive content).

We'll even pay for return shipping.\nThe Factory promo pack contains 6 extra Factory cards for Kickstarter backers. The promo pack will be available for an additional cost to those who discover Scythe after the Kickstarter campaign.\nIt may not be these exact Factory cards that end up in the promo pack.\nThe custom metal coins  (80 total) featured in the Premium, Collector's, and Art Connoisseur Edition games were designed specifically for Scythe. The set of coins is available for order by itself on the Stonemaier Games website for $25 (+ shipping) or as an add-on to any copy of the game for $22.\nThe plastic resource containers (4 total) in the Premium, Collector's, and Art Connoisseur Edition games allow for easy storage, setup, and distribution of the various tokens and coins in Scythe. There's room for exactly 4 of these containers in the Scythe box.\nPlastic container with coin prototypes.\nThe board extension in the Collector's and Art Connoisseur Editions slides next to the back side of the game board, creating a complete board with +50% bigger hexes (the content is the same; see Update 3). All units and resources in Scythe are kept on the board, so the larger hexes provide more space.\nThe game board is 624x818mm, and it grows to 818x936mm with the extension. It is available as an add-on to any copy of the game for $10 (every game board is double-sided) and will be available to order from our website by itself for $12 (+ shipping) after the project ends.\nThe realistic resource tokens (made out of resin or zinc) in the Collector's and Art Connoisseur Editions replace the wooden resource tokens (there are no wooden resource tokens in those editions). They include 80 tokens (20 each) for food, metal, oil, and wood. These tokens are available in our treasure chests (one in each chest), as well as in an add-on to any copy of the game for $21.\nThe individually-numbered boxes in the Collector's and Art Connoisseur Editions are randomly assigned. The limit of these boxes will be determined by the total number of backers at those levels.\nThe art book included with the Art Connoisseur Edition is a 100-page, full-color, hardback collection of the art featured in Scythe, as well as other pieces in Jakub Rozalski's acclaimed 1920s series. The book will measure approximately 250x290mm. It's available for pre-order by itself on the Stonemaier Games website for $25 (+ shipping) or as an add-on to any copy of the game for $23. The art book will be packed externally from the game box.\nThe wooden resource tokens aren't in the Collector's and Art Connoisseur Editions, so if you want both one of those games and wooden resources (or if you just want extra resources with any version of Scythe), please add $10 to your pledge. This is for an external pack of 20 food/grain, 20 metal, 20 wood, and 20 oil tokens.\nSamples on the left; final colors on the right.\nWe ship games in bulk to fulfillment centers around the world to reduce customs fees & VAT and to keep shipping prices low (this method is explained here; country codes are here).\nBackers are limited to 3 total games per pledge (a mix of any 3 versions of the game is fine; only pay the shipping fee once per pledge, not once per game). To add more games beyond the first (or add-ons), manually enter the $ total when making your pledge or click the blue \"Manage\" button next to a previously made pledge.\nAn example of an encounter card. When your character reaches certain parts of the board, they encounter a situation that gives you a choice of one of the three options.\nWe like to support game stores around the world by offering the special Kickstarter versions of the game to retailers during the campaign. We treat retailer backers just like other backers in that they receive their rewards before we release regular retail games into distribution.\nIf you're a retailer, please contact Jamey at stonemaiergames@gmail.com during the campaign for pricing information. After the campaign, you can reserve retail copies of Scythe by contacting our distribution broker: paul@greaterthangames.com\nAn example of an objective card. Each player receives 2 objectives at the beginning of the game and can complete one of them as a goal.\nJamey Stegmaier is the designer of Scythe, Viticulture, Tuscany, and Euphoria. He's also the co-founder and president of Stonemaier Games, and he's written a book about crowdfunding.\nJakub Rozalski is the artist, worldbuilder, and creative director of Scythe. Art prints of his work are available for purchase from him here.\nMorten Monrad Pedersen is Stonemaier's development specialist. He designed the Automa solo variant for Scythe as detailed on his BGG blog.\nCarsten Biernat & Jozsef Szollosi of Unique Voodoo Studio are the 3D modelers for Scythe's miniatures. \nChristine Santana is the lead graphic designer for Stonemaier Games.\nChris Matthew is the Panda Game Manufacturing project manager for Scythe.\nScott Wadyko is the the sculptor of the realistic resource tokens found in the collector's edition and in our new treasure chests.\nVideo: The project video was created by Josh McDowell,  narrated by A.T. Chandler, and features original Scythe music composed by Micha\u0142 Wo\u017aniak. The gif explaining the board extension was designed by Bryce Walter and reduced in size for faster loading times by Bruce Alcorn.\nPlaytesters: The development process for Scythe featured over 750 blind playtests and 628 individual playtesters. We owe a huge debt of gratitude to all of them, especially to Barry Schmaling (who built the playtester forum) and all of the lead playtesters. They had a lot to say about Scythe, but here are a few of our favorite quotes:\n\u201cFarm your little piece of the world, spread out and colonise as much as you can, or rampage with mechs projecting lethal force over your opponents. This game has it all and with so many routes to victory, no two games are the same.\u201d \u2014 Stephen \u2018Azrael\u2019 Ogden\n\u201cScythe is an excellent blend of resource management and conflict which also manages to leave you with a delightful sense of having told a story.\" \u2014 Andrew Busam\n\u201cThe Automa is challenging, relentless, and at times unforgiving, but it's also a whole lot of fun. It's a worthy adversary that earns a begrudging respect.\u201d \u2014 Jeremiah Power\nWhile we don't offer existing inventory or unrelated products as add-ons through Kickstarter, we offer other Stonemaier products on our website. These items will ship right away and cannot be held until Scythe ships.\nViticulture, Tuscany, Euphoria, Between Two Cities, and our treasure chests are also available from your friendly local game store.\nJamey's book, A Crowdfunder's Strategy Guide: Build a Better Business by Building Community, is available in a number of online and offline locations.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThrough Stonemaier Games, Jamey Stegmaier has raised over $1.4 million on Kickstarter and has delivered over 20,000 individual rewards to backers within a few months of the estimated delivery date (most are on time or early). He is an avid backer and gamer, and his book about crowdfunding was published in September 2015: http://stonemaiergames.com/kickstarter/book/\n\nHowever, Scythe presented three specific new challenges: miniatures, shipping, and balance.\n\nThis is our first time working with plastic miniatures. We had heard horror stories about other projects involving miniatures, and we've experienced a few as backers. So we wanted to start early to avoid some of the delays that can occur as the result of miniatures. We started working with Jakub and his 3D modelers in March, using Shapeways to print each version of the sculpts to see how they worked on the game board. We also worked closely with Panda's team throughout the process to make sure the sculpts are feasible and durable. We've created the molds for the miniatures and are ready for production.\n\nWe've picked up and dropped fulfillment partners over time, keeping those who pack our games well and excel at communication. Because shipping is particularly important for Scythe\u2014a big game with a box that we want delivered in pristine condition\u2014we tested out two new-to-us fulfillment partners (Funagain in the US and Snakes & Lattes in Canada) on our previous project in preparation for Scythe. We add those two to Ideaspatcher in Europe, Good Games in Australia, and Agility in China, all three of which we've worked on in the past and have had excellent results.\n\nOne of the main features of Scythe's gameplay is asymmetry between factions. It's tough to balance an asymmetric game, so after we got Scythe to a good place with local playtesters, we ran 3 different waves of multi-player blind playtesting and 2 waves of solo blind playtesting. The huge amount of anecdotal and quantitative data we collected as a result helped us ensure that Scythe is extremely well balanced (and fun!).\n\nIf you would like to know more about what we learned from our Kickstarter experiences and research, go to http://stonemaiergames.com/kickstarter/full-list-chronological/ to see 160+ Kickstarter Lessons to help you create a successful project too.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #46", "update_userinfo": "Introducing the Scythe Modular Board", "update_content": "Hi!

All you have are three awful public access shows, a small amount of cash, and endless ambition. Plus it looks like you\u2019re not the only new TV network in town...\nTHANK YOU BACKERS!\nOver 2,500 of you pledged over $100,000 to make this game a reality. I truly appreciate it, and I can't wait to deliver an incredible game to you!\nThe Networks is a tabletop strategy game from the designer of Bad Medicine, Battle Merchants, and Prolix, in which the players are all running competing television networks. You'll start from humble beginnings to amass the best-possible prime-time lineup and a solid archive of reruns. The game runs 60-90 minutes, and is for 1-5 players.\nThe challenge of the game is that your shows will require stars and ads. But some stars perform better on certain kinds of shows, and some ads perform better in certain time slots. You'll be making all sorts of juicy, tricky decisions as you guide your TV network to the top!\nIn The Networks, you will start with three awful public access shows and some money. As the game goes on, you will be canceling these shows and replacing them with better and better shows.\nShows will have varying prerequisites of stars and ads; you'll want to secure those before developing your shows. stars and ads have their own sets of conditions; they perform better on certain types of shows or in certain time slots.\nShows age each season. They usually plunge in popularity at some point, so you must be quick to replace them with fresh new shows whenever you can. \nThe Networks rewards planning and strategy, but you can't ignore the other players. They may beat you to the show you were planning on getting. Timing is crucial!\nHere is the close-to-final rulebook. Text may change slightly here and there.\nHere's a video tutorial...\nWant to try the game yourself? Here is a free print-and-play version of the game! This version of the game has no illustrations and no advanced cards.\nIt's challenging. You'll be faced with all sorts of tricky decisions every turn, as you manage your TV network. Should you go with expensive sports shows, or stick with the more time-sensitive sitcoms? Cancel a show now? Or leave your stable of stars and ads for something possibly better next season?\nIt's tight. I've spent over five years working on this game, mercilessly squishing mechanisms that sounded cool at first but didn't fit perfectly within the game. What's left is a smooth, refined game that plays beautifully.\nIt's easy to learn. All your moves are very thematic, so there aren't any weird or fiddly rules. And I've engineered the start of the game to not be overwhelming for your first game.\nIt looks fantastic. The Networks features graphic design from Heiko G\u00fcnther (Glory to Rome: Black Box, The New Science, Tesla Vs. Edison) and art from Travis Kinchy. It is fantastic to look at, and the graphic design has been specifically playtested to be as smooth and intuitive as possible. In fact, most of the art in the project video at the top of this page came directly from the game!\nIt's replayable. The game comes with advanced cards designed to go in after you've got the hang of the basic game. There are a bunch of different ways your games can go, and you'll always be facing a fresh challenge.\nIt plays equally well from 1 to 5 players. Too many games have optimistic player ranges. Some are 5-player games that really should be 4-player games. Others play like completely different games at different player counts. The Networks scales wonderfully from 1-5 players, providing a consistently fun experience each time.\nYes, the solo mode is really good. Lots of games feature solo modes that are throw-ins, but The Networks' solo mode is just as good as any other player count. That's why it's not a stretch goal. I feel that The Networks' solo mode is a fundamental, core part of the game, so it's baked into the base funding goal.\nIt's funny. From starting shows like \"Get to Know Your Lower Colon\" and \"Emergency Broadcast Test Hour\" to later shows like \"Communist-y\", \"Upton Crabby\", and \"NCISICBMOMGOMG: Scranton\" to stars like \"That Weird-Looking Guy\" and \"Always Dies In Everything\", this is a game with a sense of humor.\nYour pledge actually makes a difference. There are publishers out there using Kickstarter as a pre-order system. If you don't pledge, the game will come out anyway. But I need your help to release The Networks next summer. And as a backer, you'll have my ear if you have any questions, comments, or concerns about the game.\nRahdo Runs Through\nUndead Viking\n Bower's Game Corner\nJon Gets Games\nBoard Game Brawl\nLet's Level Up\nMaggibot\n\"This is the perfect medium-weight game...

It encourages you to excel at the inanity of television programming on the one hand while lambasting it on the other, and yet this charming mix of motives adds up to a game that\u2019s amusing and strategic all at once.\" - The Cardboard Republic review (Awarded the Seal of the Republic!)\n\"The Networks is a thoroughly enjoyable card game. Deciding when to develop new shows and drop existing shows, as well as what time slots, who will star in them and what advertising to use is surprisingly fun. The game plays fast, is easy to teach but has many tough decisions. I cannot wait to see what potential additions come about from stretch goals for this game\u2019s Kickstarter campaign.\" - Board Game Quest\n\"This is a winner. I want one. We're actually going to fight over this copy.\" - Punching Cardboard\n\"Overall, The Networks was done beautifully and kept me wanting more... kinda like my yearn for reality television, but much less guilty this time around.\" - Indie Tabletop\n\"The Networks is simply an extremely well-designed game... and the gameplay is just so solid. Maybe it\u2019s true that there\u2019s nothing good on TV, but, quite frankly, with The Networks, I\u2019ve already got plenty of entertainment at my fingertips.\" - Gameosity\n\"Overall, The Networks is a funny game where every decision in the solo game is mired with consequences, leaving you constantly grasping for the best strategy turn after turn. It never stops narrowing your window of opportunity, constantly forcing you to push yourself to develop shows, hire actors, and acquire ads in an escalatingly diminishing market. It's a constant push-and-pull mental exercise in dynamic strategizing as you race to get the best shows possible for the most viewers!\" - Willie Hung, Gameritis Guy\nWant more than two copies of the game with your pledge?

After a long time learning how to make a good game, I'm finally seeing success. My first published game, Prolix, was released by Z-Man games in 2010. My second published game, Battle Merchants, was released by Minion Games in September 2014. \nI am self-publishing my third game, Bad Medicine; it is in the process of shipping to backers after a very successful Kickstarter campaign at the beginning of the year.\nI live in Jersey City, New Jersey, with my girlfriend and two adorable ferrets. I do a lot of work with the NYC-Playtest group, helping New York City-area designers make better board games. In my life, I've recorded indie rock albums, edited sound for film, programmed computers, written and performed comedy, and seen more theater and live music than I can remember.\nThe Networks will be my second self-published game and fourth published game overall. I've been working on it since December 2009; almost six years! Publishing this game will be the next step in my becoming a full-fledged self-publisher. It's a difficult business to succeed in, but I can do it with your help!\nWant to know more about me? You can read my blog, follow me on Twitter, or sign up for my mailing list!\n Here's what Heiko has to say about himself...\nI am a carpenter and a graphic designer by trade. In 2010, together with five other graphic designers (who, like me, have an urge to make the world a more beautiful place) I founded Bureau Stabil, an agency for graphic design and related stuff. We operate from Saarbr\u00fccken and love our jobs.\nIn my family, we have always been playing board games, mostly the variety that allows you to be mean to the people you really like. Playing board games to me is, among other things, a way to build character. Much like in real life, there are rules you need to adhere to, there are ways you might try and break these rules, there are other people whose actions you might want to guess, react to or influence \u2013 in short to interact with \u2013 to be successful, and, most importantly, you make and keep changing plans and look for ways to bring them fruition. \nBut unlike real life, if a plan doesn't work out, you restart and try a different one next time. And, once the game is over, no matter how mean you acted, no matter how devious you were, no matter what grudges you held against your opponents during the game, all of that is over, the testing ground is closed and your friends are your friends again.\nHere's what Travis has to say about himself...\nI am a self-trained artist, sculptor, and illustrator currently being held captive in my studio and hermitage in Cleveland, Ohio. Ever since I could hold a crayon most of my time on this planet has been spent on the study and practice of Art, but when my time wasn\u2019t being occupied by drawing robots, people in capes, or sculpting monsters, it was on games. \nI am fascinated by games. Your average person will only spend at most two minutes looking at a painting hanging in a museum, but that same person if playing a game will gladly look at cards or a game board for hours. There is a captive audience ready to view the form and function we create. I want to help elevate games as an artistic medium.\nI created Formal Ferret Games as an outlet for my own game designs. I wanted to take advantage of the new tools offered to designers, and release my work directly to the public.\nIndie game design and publishing is still a lot of work, but it's incredible work. I'm very grateful to be able to do it!\nCredits\nKickstarter page graphics:\nHerb Ferman\nMichael Bonet\nMain video voices:\nEthan Hova\nBrodrick Jones\nAi Lake\nCarrie Margulies\nTim Rodriguez\nMain video animations and sound effects:\nBen Shulman, Jellybean Soup\nMain video art:\nTravis Kinchy\nMain video direction, writing, and editing:\nGil Hova", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nBoard games are hard to make! Anyone who's used Kickstarter to back a tabletop game can tell you about projects that funded but delivered late... if at all.\n\nI've been designing games for a long time, and in March, I successfully funded my first self-published game, Bad Medicine. That game went to the printer this summer, and is about to be delivered to its backers. \n\nI won't call myself a Kickstarter veteran just yet. But at this point, I've done enough to earn your trust. I have the resources and the know-how to make The Networks; all I need is some help from you.\n\nHere is what I'm doing to make sure The Networks will not be delayed.\n\nFirst: The game design is complete, and its art and layout are close to done; all that remains is the content that we'll be getting from Kickstarter backers. So there will be no delays for waiting for art or additional playtesting, once we are done with the small amount of art coming from the Kickstarter campaign.\n\nSecond: The game will be printed by Ad Magic, the same company that prints Cards Against Humanity, as well as dozens of other games (including my previous game, Bad Medicine). They are incredibly responsive, thorough, and professional.\n\nThird: I will be using professional fulfillment services to deliver the products, instead of trying to handle things myself. That leaves shipping in the hands of people who can send packages safely and quickly. I'm also using a separate fulfillment service based in the UK to handle UK and EU fulfillment, which will relieve a lot of logistical and tax-related headaches.\n\nFourth: I've built a ton of connections in my almost 15 years designing games, many of which I used during the making of Bad Medicine. I've also backed plenty of Kickstarter projects, some which delivered on time, some which delivered late, and some that never delivered at all. I learned a lot from each of them.\n\nFifth: My printer will be handling the delivery of the game from the factory, so that will reduce a lot of surprises. I'm also consulting with a logistics expert who has lots of experience handling shipments, especially board games, from the factory where the game will be printed. That means I should be prepared for anything surprising that might come my way.\n\nAt this point, I'm familiar with just about everything that can go wrong in a Kickstarter. Believe me, failing to fund is not even close to the worst-case scenario! I've heard many stories, from artists never delivering their art, to pallets stolen at the port, to mold in the game boxes and snails in the shipping container.\n\nBut I've built a great team around me. I feel that I am prepared to deliver this product to you close to my estimate of June 2016.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #41", "update_userinfo": "Networks: Executives expansion campaign is up... and already FUNDED!", "update_content": "Hi backer!

Hunt", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Set in the mid-1800s, the age of whaling, New Bedford gives 1 to 4 players the chance to build the Massachusetts town of the same name into a thriving community. Gather resources to add buildings with new actions, and launch ships to go whaling. Go out longest for the best choice, but wait too long and the whales become harder to catch. And don't forget to pay your crew when ships return! Carefully balance risk management and timing to earn the most points in this medium-weight worker placement and resource management game.\nNew Bedford is a game for 1-4 players, ages 13 and up, and designed by Nat Levan. New Bedford is a distinguished alum of the Unpub program - a series of public and private playtest events held each year to help designers present, hone, and polish their game designs with the gaming public, as well as board game production professionals.\nIf you'd like to know more about the design process behind New Bedford, designer Nat Levan has extensively chronicled the game's development on the Oakleaf Games blog. Nat also sat down with the Dice Hate Me crew on episode 74 of The State of Games podcast to talk about the game; the New Bedford portion begins at the 25 minute mark.\nA bit more detail: Over twelve rounds, players take turns placing their two workers. The town board and whaling board contain basic game actions: Taking goods (food, wood, and brick), selling goods, constructing buildings, docking ships, and launching ships. These actions can be used multiple times per round, with the first player to do so in a round receiving a bonus of more goods or reducing the number of goods paid.\nMost buildings add extra action spaces with new actions, combined actions, and more powerful versions of basic actions. You own whatever you build, with others needing to pay you to use them and you earning points from them at game's end.\nYou need to spend food to send ships whaling, choosing how far out to send them. At the end of the round, ships move closer to shore and whale tokens are drawn randomly. Ships that are farthest out have first chance to pick the valuable sperm whales, but as they move in, others have the opportunity to launch farther out and get a better pick, possibly leaving you with only empty seas. Over the course of the game, whales become more rare and empty seas more common - an historical reflection of the toll that whaling had on the environment. Once a ship reaches shore, a percentage of the profits (the \"lay\") must be paid in order to keep the gathered whales.\nIf you'd like to dive deeper into New Bedford, you can download the print-and-play version of the game right here: (Components and Rules).The PnP includes all the buildings, whales, the town board, the player boards and the whaling board. You'll need to provide bits to represent the wood, food, brick, meeples, ships, and money (cubes, coins, toy boats - whatever you'd like).\nNew Bedford will offer the same hallmark replay value as other Dice Hate Me titles from Greater Than Games, with high-quality components, thick punchboard bits, and lots and lots of wood. Here's a list of what you'll find inside the box:\nBase Game Components\nNew Bedford will come in the Dice Hate Me Games \"Rooster\"-sized box - the same size as Compounded and VivaJava Dice. What's this crazy talk? Take a look here for more information on our box sizes and game categories!\nIn addition, backers at any level may add $6 to their pledge to receive a copy of Nantucket. This is a small, 2-player game with a whaling theme also designed by Nat Levan.\nNantucket takes you to \"The Little Grey Lady of the Sea\" during the early American whaling industry. You need just a few cards and coins to play in whatever port you find yourself. Mix and match two cards to form the modular board. Then use your single action each round to carefully build the town and send out ships. After performing your actions, flip the coins on your ship to catch a whale. Play until the town is fully constructed, supplies run out, or the last whales are taken. Between buildings and earned coins, may the best captain win!\nIt will be available after the campaign for $9.95, but is available to backers of this campaign only for $6, and will not increase your shipping charges.

We've planned stretch goals out through $80,000, which will be the final stretch goal point for this campaign. Thanks for supporting New Bedford!\nAs with previous campaigns, we unfortunately have to charge shipping on this campaign, but are continuing to work to minimize the shipping cost to you. Shipping on this campaign is priced as follows:\nUS: $9\nCanada: $14\nEU: $35\nOther: $50\nFor customers in Canada, the EU, and Australia, this includes customs duties and import taxes, but it does not for other countries.\nWe know that international shipping is annoyingly expensive; believe us, we are just as annoyed as you are! However, to help offset the shipping costs a bit, we have work-arounds.You can add additional copies of New Bedford, including all stretch goals, to your pledge for +$29, and the shipping rates are fixed regardless of the number of games. If you have a bunch of friends who want to support this project, just make one group pledge for as many games as you\u2019d like, and you'll all receive every stretch goal!\nBy 1848, the city of New Bedford in Massachusetts had become the most powerful city in the whaling industry and was soon to be one of the richest cities in the world. Whale oil exported from New Bedford helped to fuel the world and, eventually, usher in the Industrial Revolution; in time, it would be referred to as \"the city that lit the world\".\nIn 1841, Herman Melville sailed out from New Bedford working as a whaler on the ship Acushnet. His experiences in whaling eventually lead him to write the novel Moby-Dick. It was published in 1851, and New Bedford is the initial setting for the novel.\nHistoric New Bedford\n\"The theme is wonderful and absolutely fitting. It\u2019s well integrated and unique... The bottom line... New Bedford is a town worth visiting.\" - John Moller, Cartrunk Entertainment (click to read his full review)\n\u201cBefore I even had the chance to crack open New Bedford, the game caught my attention because someone had mentioned that it was like a more concise and elegant version of Le Havre. While I\u2019ll agree that the two games do share some similarities, saying that New Bedford is essentially Le Havre light does it a great disservice. New Bedford offers its own unique experience that feels fresh and not borrowed.\u201d - Kyle Chivers, Euro Board Game Blog (click to read his full review)\n\"New Bedford does a lot of things right - but the best thing about the game is that it is one of those games that is easy to both learn and teach, but will surprise you with its depth after you dive in for subsequent plays.\" - James Flemming, Board Game Reviews by Josh (click to read his full review)\n\u201cBeyond the theme, I like New Bedford for several game-play reasons. I am reminded of Puerto Rico from the standpoint that players can score through the staple process of whaling as well as from buying buildings to augment the town of New Bedford. Likewise, New Bedford includes the worker-placement-building quality of Le Havre with buildings that facilitate collecting materials, constructing buildings, or sending out whaling ships. I actually find New Bedford cleaner and more elegant than Le Havre.\u201d - Paul Owen, Man Overboard (click to see more comments)\n\u201cSolid worker placement game. The two different elements to the game, building the village and the whaling, complement each other nicely. I got to play this at Grand Con at an Unpub event. Multiple victory paths and some interesting combos can be made with some of the village tiles. Can't wait for this one to come out.\u201d - David Taylor, To the Table\n\u201cWhen I played New Bedford when it was printer paper and glue I fell in love with the concept and game play. Now that I see the final product the game has been brought to life in a whole new way and still sits in my top five to play as two player with my hubby or with a group of friends!\u201d - Lesley Louder, The Chalkboard Gamer\n\"New Bedford has all the strategizing of a game like Agricola without the stress. It wonderfully meshes worker placement, town building, and tile drawing in such a way that it plays fast without comprising any depth.\u201d - Scott King, game photographer and blogger\n\"Such a smooth, engaging gaming experience. New Bedford is a great low-cost-of-entry euro that has enough game for game night, but is still completely accessible for my family.\" - Matt Riddle, co-designer of Fleet and person of no consequence\n\"When I played this game at an Unpub over a year ago, I was unsure if I would like a game about whaling. That was quickly proven wrong, and I told Nat when he was done with New Bedford I wanted a copy of it.\" - Derrick Vidal, Baked Fresh Daily Games\n\u201cFrom the moment I sat down with New Bedford and took my first turn, I knew that I was seeing something special. While I\u2019ve had the privilege of playing several games in the Unpub program, only a few of them make me want to drop money on the spot. New Bedford was exactly that. The cool thing is, I\u2019ve only seen it get even better! Take my money now!\u201d - Greg Miller, Baked Fresh Daily Games\n\"One of those rare occasions where everyone at the table was lost in the world and loving every minute.\" - Josh Mills, game designer\nNew Bedford\u2019s design was influenced by a time when whaling was a part of daily life - and that eventually lead to a modern crisis for many species of whales. To make it clear, we don\u2019t condone modern whaling. But we think that the history of New Bedford and the whaling industry is an important subject. Just like our chemistry game, Compounded, we believe that games designed for entertainment can also be educational - and, in this case, foster discussion about a controversial topic. For more information on modern whaling and conservation efforts, please check out this overview from the World Wildlife Fund.\nNat & Chris\nWe knew that the theme of historic whaling could be considered a bit controversial by some, but we believe in New Bedford and in the theme. As Herman Melville once wrote about his novel, Moby-Dick, \"To produce a mighty book, you must choose a mighty theme.\" We think New Bedford is a mighty little game, and we are proud to present it to all of you. Thanks, as always, for the continued support for Dice Hate Me Games from our Kickstarter family. You continue to amaze and humble us.\nLet's keep sailing,\nChris & Nat", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nBefore the merger of Dice Hate Me Games and Greater Than Games, a previous version of New Bedford was on Kickstarter, only to see its campaign canceled. There were many reasons for the decision to cancel the project at that time, which was discussed on episode 76 of the State of Games podcast. However, we believe that the most important reason was to make the game much better. We believe that we have done so, and are thrilled to re-launch the game at this time. However, there is a risk that people will not be willing to take another look at this fantastic game.\n\nAdditionally, as with any project that involves the production and manufacture of a good to be delivered, there is certainly a real chance for hiccups, delays and more than one or two gremlins gumming up the works along the way. Many boardgame projects on Kickstarter have been seriously hampered by art production delays, problems with an overseas factory, missing units and one shipping snafu after another.\n\nLuckily, we have a few projects under our belt, and have dealt with many of those snags along the way. We try to plan for all contingencies, and we've been fairly successful with that in our past projects.\n\nWe won't lie - stuff happens. Delays can occur. Sometimes you have to go back and forth on color samples six times just to get the color right, and even then the color isn't perfect. But what we do promise is that we will hold ourselves to the same high standards we expect from other board game publishers and our previous projects, and we will be completely honest and open with each of you every step of the way.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #38", "update_userinfo": "Errata Tiles", "update_content": "Greetings Backers!\nBy now, all of you *should* have gotten your errata tiles if you selected that option in BackerKit.

Use Strength to slay minions like pesky Goblins... and beasts like the mighty Owlbear... to earn rewards. Then, defeat the boss in each area to clear the land and earn rewards based on the amount of monsters you've killed in that area.\nPlayers start with 1 Peasant and 1 Knight. Throughout the game you and your friends will gather Gold to build a tableau of loyal citizens like the hard-working Butcher... the magical Paladin... or the brutal Mercenary.\nIn a single game, there are 10 different citizens to choose from, plus almost all of them have alternate cards with different characters and different effects\u2026 a total of 18 different citizens to choose from so every game will present you with different options and different challenges. No two games will be alike.\nOnce you've hired the right combination of citizens, you can buy powerful domains like the Village - that produces gold for you every round... or the Castle - that lets you manipulate the dice.\nA result of 3 and 5 trigger 3, 5, and 8 for maximum payout!\nPlaying Valeria: Card Kingdoms is simple and intuitive. Players take turns rolling the dice. All citizens are activated with the result of each die and the sum of both dice. When you roll the dice, you trigger the ability on the left for your citizens\u2026 and all of the other players with matching citizens trigger the abilities on the right. That\u2019s right! Everyone benefits when the dice are rolled. It\u2019s even possible that your friends will reap greater benefits that you on your own turn.\nAt the end of the game, reveal your Duke and count up all of your Victory Points to see who will become... the next king of Valeria.\nWatch the Rahdo Runs Through video: \nOr this play through video: \n Or, if you're in Taiwan, try this rules video:\n...and this play-thru video:\nDownload the Valeria: Card Kingdoms Rule Book\n                                                                                                                                   Download the Valeria: Card Kingdoms Print & Play Files\nPlay in the Tabletop Simulator on Steam\n\nBase Game Content List: \n108 Citizen Cards -- 6 each of 18 Different Characters \n42 Monster Cards -- 21 unique Art Pieces \n24 Domain Cards -- 24 Unique Pieces of Art \n10 Duke Cards -- You could be one of them! \n15 Starter Cards & 10 Exhausted Cards \n2 Six-sided Marbled Dice & 168 Wood Tokens \n1 Rulebook\nKickstarter Exclusives and Bonuses:\n10 Kickstarter Exclusive Alternate Art Starter Cards\n1 Bonus Duke\nSecond to backing the project, the best thing you can do to help Valeria: Card Kingdoms succeed is to spread the word on social media sites.

Daily Magic Productions has asked me to be their Kickstarter Manager as well as their Production Manager for Valeria: Card Kingdoms, and I am grateful for the trust they've put in my abilities. \n\nI've been running Kickstarter projects since April 2010 (Alien Frontiers). I've worked independently, I've worked for a mainstream publisher, and, as I'm doing here, I've managed projects as a gun-for-hire. I've definitely been around the block a few times and seen the extremes at both ends of the Kickstarter roller coaster. No matter how much experienced a project manager has, things can run smoothly, or they can hit bumps along the way. I can only make you one meaningful promise -- I will do my best to make it all go to plan and I will be honest and open throughout. Thank you for your support.\n\n--David MacKenzie\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDaily Magic Productions is committed to delivering quality products. We realize that the publication of a board game can be complicated and some problems may occur. In an effort to reduce the likelihood of delays and mistakes, we have taken several steps to prepare and set ourselves up for success: \n\n1. We have hired David MacKenzie as a Production Manager for the entirety of game development, the Kickstarter campaign, game production, and various other tasks. His years of experience will help us tackle any issues that may come our way. \n\n2. We are dedicated to backer communication and player feedback. As David runs the campaign, he will be as transparent about the process and open to feedback as he can be without putting timelines for delivery in jeopardy. \n\n3. We have done significant pre-production and have all the art for the game completed and the graphic design is nearly complete. With our years of digital game development, we learned the value of pre-production work and know that it saves time and money at the end of the project. \n\n4. With the help of David, we have contacted several manufacturers to find us the best quality at the best price. We have the production quote ready and can initiate production in short order. \n\n5. We have done rigorous play-testing on Valeria: Card Kingdoms. Not only has it been continuously tested at Game Designers Clubhouse, but we have shipped prototypes all over the world.\n\nWe hope that everything goes as planned, but if something falls through the cracks, we are ready and willing to put every tool at our disposal as a seasoned and successful game development company to make the project run smoothly.\n\nThank you for your support!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #55", "update_userinfo": "A Long Overdue Miracle", "update_content": "Greetings Valerians...\nThere have been times when I doubted this day would ever come, but it is really happening.

We have published seven games so far, with one of them (Progress: Evolution of Technology) financed through Kickstarter and delivered without any delays in October 2014. We have also successfully Kickstarted our first large expansion: The Edge of Extinction for Exodus: Proxima Centauri, scheduled to be delivered at the end of August 2015.\n\nWith two successful projects we are making use of our experiences to improve our processes and further decrease any risks. As Mistfall is our third Kickstarter campaign, we already know the ropes, and with the time used to prepare not only the game, but also the campaign itself, we are ready to face any possible challenges.\n\nOur goal with Mistfall is to produce the game within 60 days from the campaign end, and to deliver before the end of September 2015. We already have a detailed production and shipping plan in place. Our main manufacturer is located in Poland, which allows us to supervise the production process personally on an almost daily basis in order to ensure that the game comes with the highest quality components, and that is manufactured in a timely manner.\n\nThe fulfilment will be handled by the same companies that helped us deliver Progress: Evolution of Technology in 2014 and are currently working with us on the delivery of Exodus: Edge of Extinction. We have dedicated fulfilment partners in the USA, Canada and the EU.\n\nAlthough Mistfall is fully developed and most of the artwork for the game is ready, which makes us confident in our ability to deliver the game on time, we are also prepared for unexpected delays. In the worst case scenario, the production may add delays of maximum 15 days, and shipping & customs may add extra 15-25 days.\n\nWe are experienced at dealing with large production runs, and we are preparing backup plans for each step of our project, starting from production, through shipping, to final delivery.\n\nMISSING/DAMAGED ITEMS\n\nBecause we are dealing with a large number of games produced, packed and shipped, there is always a chance for human error or damaged parts.

We'll even pay for shipping.\nLimited Availability: We don't do Kickstarter exclusive items, but we'll only print a limited number of the special edition as based on the final pledge totals.\nMake It Better for Everyone: The more stretch goals we reach, the more enhanced and beautiful the game will be! \nWe Listen: We treat backers as collaborators--we truly value your input as we put the finishing touches on the game, and we promptly address all questions and ideas.\nLocalized Shipping: Our shipping fees for Kickstarted games are so low because we send games in bulk to fulfillment centers around the world. This is your chance to lock in the lowest possible shipping rate.\nBackers Come First: You'll get your copy of Between Two Cities well before it enters traditional distribution channels. Remember that retailers can be backers too!\nWe Need You: We've covered the cost of graphic design, art, and development for Between Two Cities, but we can't manufacture and ship the game without your support.\nA few of the 250+ playtesters who helped us along the way.\nWe ship games in bulk to fulfillment centers around the world to eliminate customs fees & VAT and to keep shipping prices low (this method is explained here; country codes are here).\nBackers are limited to 3 total copies per pledge, as that's the number that can fit inside a shipping carton with proper packaging. For additional copies, you can pledge under a different Kickstarter account.\nBetween Two Cities is played in three rounds. In each round, you'll start with a fresh hand of tiles. Select two of those tiles, passing the rest to the player on your left or right (depends on the round). Place one of those tiles in the city on your left and one in the city on your right, then pick up the hand that was passed to you and repeat the process.\nThe middle round actually involves drawing 3 rectangular \"duplex\" tiles (two building tiles side by side in a vertical or horizontal configuration) and selecting 2 of them--there is no drafting in this round.\nAfter all three rounds, you will have built a 4x4 city on your left and a 4x4 city on your right. Add up the scores for all cities, but only compare your lowest scoring city to each other player's lowest-scoring city to determine the winner.\nEach of the tiles (art shown below) scores in the following way. The final tiles have scoring reminders below the art:\nShop (yellow): The more shops you have in a row or column, the higher the score.\nPark (green): Each group of adjacent parks score an ascending amount of points based on the number park tiles in the group.\nHouse (brown): Each house scores a point for each other tile type in the city (they want variety).\nOffice (blue): The more offices, the better. If they're next to at least 1 Tavern, they score a bonus point.\nTavern (red): There are 4 types of taverns (different icons)--you want to get as many sets of different tavern types as possible.\nFactory (gray): The cities with the most factories score more points per factory than other cities.\nThe game includes a head-to-head 2-player variant that removes the partnership mechanism but increases the impact of the tiles you choose to pass (or not pass) to your opponent. \nClick here for the rules and the free playtest version of the print-and-play files.\nThe special edition of Between Two Cities features a limited-run version of the game. The game itself is the same, but the box will be embossed in gold foil highlights and will be stamped with a number unique to your copy of the game (e.g., \"1287 / 4000\"). The special edition also includes rules in French and German (in addition to English rules).\nThe special edition will also include 7 additional pairs of city tokens. When we were designing the city tokens, we designed 14 of them and had e-newsletter subscribers vote on their favorites. The top 7 were selected for the retail game, but we liked the other 7 so much that we decided to include them in the special edition for extra flavor. They do not expand the game past 7 players or impact the gameplay in any way.\nIn addition to the standard city tokens, the special edition also includes the Arc de Triomphe, US Capitol, Brandenburg Gate, St. Basil's, Big Ben, the White House, and the Forbidden City. Each token in the final version will be a unique color.\nOne of the exciting aspects of designing a complete core game is you generate a lot of ideas for expansions. We look forward to discussing these possibilities with backers during and after the Kickstarter campaign to see the types of expansions they're the most excited about. These are the two styles of expansions we're considering:\nVertical: These would expand upon the base game, allowing players to develop their cities through the ages by adding more rounds and new tile types.\nHorizontal: These would take the core mechanisms of the game and translate them to other themes, like Between Two Castles, Planets, Dystopias, etc.\nWe like to support game stores around the world by offering the special Kickstarter versions of our game to retailers during the campaign.

This process was made easy by the designers' willingness to hear and test new ideas.\n\nDuring the evolution of Stonemaier Games, we've learned the importance of blind playtesting (having people learn the game from the rulebook and test the game away from the designers). We've been fortunate to have hundreds of Stonemaier Ambassadors and their friends volunteer to playtest our games so as to make them as good as possible for the first print run. We've also learned the value of having checks and balances at every step in the production process, but when we do mess up, we go above and beyond to remedy the error.\n\nStonemaier Games established an advisory board of industry veterans in January '13 to help us mitigate risks and challenges. So even though we will surely face new challenges in the future, we have an incredible team of experienced advisers to point us in the right direction. We also work with Panda Game Manufacturing to produce the game, a company with a wealth of knowledge and experience.\n\nStonemaier Games has delivered all of our Kickstarter rewards from 4 projects within a few months of the estimated delivery date, sometimes even early. However, we seek to continue to improve that process to keep shipping rates low, deliver quickly, and ensure that the games arrive in perfect condition. We've learned that shipments sent from China to Australia need fumigation certificates for wooden components and that products shipped anywhere need \"Made in China\" clearly listed on the exterior of every product for them to clear customs. In short, we've made mistakes, and not only have we learned from them, we've shared them transparently with backers and on our blog to help other creators.\n\nIf you would like to know more about what we learned from our Kickstarter experiences and research, go to www.stonemaiergames.com to see 100+ Kickstarter Lessons to help you create a successful project too.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #29", "update_userinfo": "Between Two Cities: Capitals Release Day!", "update_content": "Today is a special day.

Hunt", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Exploding Kittens is a highly strategic kitty-powered version of Russian Roulette. Players take turns drawing cards until someone draws an exploding kitten and loses the game. The deck is made up of cards that let you avoid exploding by peeking at cards before you draw, forcing your opponent to draw multiple cards, or shuffling the deck.\n\nThe game gets more and more intense with each card you draw because fewer cards left in the deck means a greater chance of drawing the kitten and exploding in a fiery ball of feline hyperbole.\nThe game was created by Elan Lee (Xbox, ARGs), Matthew Inman (The Oatmeal), and Shane Small (Xbox, Marvel).  We think this game combines all the things we're best at creating, and and put together this Kickstarter campaign because we can't build this without you.\nSo if you're into card games or laser beams or weaponized enchiladas, please help us make this game a reality.  We think you'll love it as much as we do.\nHugs and enchilada kisses, \n-Elan, Matt, and Shane.\nThe Origin Story\nExploding Kittens started when Shane Small proposed a game to Elan Lee where a joker was inserted into a deck of cards and they took turns picking cards until the joker came up. It was called \u201cBomb Squad\u201d and it wasn\u2019t any fun at all.\nOver the next few weeks, two important things happened: First, after neglecting work, family, and a social life, Shane and Elan developed a rule-set that started working and brought the game to life. Second, Matt Inman saw the game, thought it was super fun, and asked to join the team. (btw, if Matthew Inman ever asks you if he can join your team, the answer is \u201cHELL YES\u201d.)\nWe changed the name to \"Exploding Kittens\" and our little team was born.\nBUT YOU'RE BLOWING UP KITTENS! NOT COOL, BUDDY.\nWe struggled with this a lot. We love the name Exploding Kittens, but we don't want to hurt kittens. We also don't want the kittens to be hurt by anyone else. Eventually we decided to explore the concept of the kittens blowing themselves up.\nFirst, Matt tried drawing the kittens as the actual bombs:\nBut that felt too Angry Birds\u2019ish.\nNext, we tried making the kittens suicidal, but that felt terrible.\nIn the end, we realized that everyone understands feline shenanigans, and that could be our solution.  Our kitties would not blow up out of malicious intent or negligence, but by doing the things that kittens do, like running across keyboards or chewing on things they shouldn't be chewing on.\nFrom there, the rest of the cards fell into place, and the cards used to defuse the exploding kittens were items you'd use to defuse regular kittens.\nHELP US BUILD THIS GAME\nWe wanted to put this project on Kickstarter because it's the fastest way for us to get the game into your hands and make improvements as a community.  We think this game is great, but we need your help making it even better.\nSo, if a world full of weaponized pork missiles is a world you want to live in, please back this project and help us build this game. \n\nWith love and pork missiles,\n-The Exploding Kittens Team  (Matt, Elan, and Shane)\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nFor more information about the game: http://www.explodingkittens.com\n\nFollow us:  Facebook  Twitter\n\nMusic: Royalty-free music from Bensound.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nProduction of the game is simple: it's just a card game, so other than building the box it's a relatively straightforward product to make.

Hunt", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Set in the mid-1800s, the age of whaling, New Bedford gives 2 to 4 players the chance to build the Massachusetts town of the same name into a thriving community. Gather resources to add buildings with new actions and launch ships to go whaling. Go out longest for the best choice, but wait too long and the whales become harder to catch. And don't forget to pay your crew when ships return! Carefully balance time management and timing to earn the most points in this medium-weight worker placement and resource management game.\nA bit more detail: Over twelve rounds players take turns placing their two workers. The town board and whaling board contain basic game actions: taking goods (food, wood, brick), selling goods, constructing buildings, docking ships, and launching ships. These actions can be used multiple times per round, with the first player to do so in a round receiving a bonus or more goods or reducing the number of goods paid.\nMost buildings add extra action spaces with new actions, combined actions, and more powerful versions of basic actions. You own whatever you build, with others needing to pay to use them and you earning points from them at game's end.\nYou need to pay to send ships whaling, choosing how far out to send them. At the end of the round, ships move closer to shore and whale tokens are drawn randomly. Ships that are farthest out have first chance to pick the valuable sperm whales, but as they move in, others have the opportunity to launch farther out and get a better pick, possibly leaving you with only empty seas. Over the course of the game, whales become more rare and empty seas more common - an historical reflection of the toll that whaling had on the environment. Once a ship reaches shore, a percentage of the profits (the \"lay\") must be paid in order to keep the whales selected.\nCustom wooden ship meeples\nAfter twelve rounds, all ships must return, and players total their points from buildings, whales, and extra money.\nGen Con 2014 - New Bedford Prototype Demo\n Unpub LIVE PLAY of New Bedford\nNew Bedford will offer the same hallmark replay value as other Dice Hate Me Games titles, with high-quality components, thick punchboard bits, and lots and lots of wood. Here's a list of what you'll find inside the box:\n1 punchboard Town board\n4 punchboard player boards\n1 punchboard Whaling board\n8 wooden Worker meeples\n8 wooden Ships (four with two-tone colored sails)\n1 wooden Ships Wheel (Start Player) token\n1 wooden Anchor (Round Marker) token\n4 punchboard sperm whale tokens\n20 punchboard bowhead whale tokens\n36 punchboard right whale tokens\n16 punchboard empty sea tokens\n20 punchboard town Building tiles\n50 punchboard Coins\n25 wooden Wood tokens\n30 wooden Food tokens\n20 wooden Brick cubes\n1 canvas whale token bag\nNew Bedford will come in the Dice Hate Me Games \"Rooster\"-sized box - the same size as Compounded and VivaJava Dice. What's this crazy talk? Take a look here for more information on our box sizes and game categories!\nNew Bedford is a game for 2-4 players, ages 12 and up, and designed by Nat Levan. New Bedford is a distinguished alum of the Unpub program - a series of public and private playtest events held each year to help designers present, hone and polish their game designs with the gaming public, as well as board game production professionals.\n If you'd like to know more about the design process behind New Bedford, designer Nat Levan has extensively chronicled the game's development on the Oakleaf Games blog, which you can read right here. Nat also sat down with the Dice Hate Me crew on episode 74 of The State of Games podcast to talk about the game. You can listen to that right over here; the New Bedford portion begins at the 25 minute mark.\nIf you'd like to dive deeper into New Bedford, you can download the print-and-play version of the game right here. You can also check out the rules for the game in the PnP download files.\nThe print-and-play includes all the buildings, whales, the town board, the player boards and the whaling board. You'll need to provide bits to represent the wood, food, brick, meeples, ships, and money (cubes, coins, toy boats - whatever you'd like).\nBy 1848 New Bedford, Massachusetts had become the most powerful city in the whaling industry and, soon, one of the richest cities in the world. Whale oil exported from New Bedford helped to fuel the world and, eventually, usher in the Industrial Revolution; it would eventually be referred to as \"the city that lit the world\".\nin 1841, Herman Melville sailed out from New Bedford working as a whaler on the ship Acushnet. His experiences in whaling eventually lead him to write the novel Moby-Dick. It was published in 1851, and New Bedford is the initial setting for the novel.\nAchieving our base funding goal ensures that Dice Hate Me Games will be able to publish New Bedford with the quality that we all have come to expect. The base game of New Bedford is priced according to our initial funding goal; however, if we exceed that funding goal we will be able to add more to the game, like possibly a card inspansion, improvements to the turn and first player markers, and maybe even a microgame!\nHere are a couple of sneak peeks into what we have planned for stretch goals!\nFirst off, we want to upgrade the wooden ship tokens - or, shipeeples, if you prefer. We\u2019ve priced out a token upgrade that has two parts - the main body of the ship, and the sails which are attached. The ship body is wider than the sails which gives it great stability and a more realistic, constructed look. If we can push this campaign beyond our funding goal, we\u2019d love to upgrade to these!\nNext up - more buildings! These expansion buildings would be included as a Kickstarter promotional outside the box, not immediately available for retail sale after Kickstarter backers receive their copies. This is one of the most exciting things we had planned for stretching out the campaign, so if this excites you all, as well, let\u2019s put some wind in these sails!\nPlease help spread the word of New Bedford to family, friends and anyone else you think would enjoy the game so that we can reach our funding goal and roll out those stretch goals!\n\"The theme is wonderful and absolutely fitting. It\u2019s well integrated and unique... The bottom line... New Bedford is a town worth visiting.\" - John Moller, Cartrunk Entertainment (click to read his full review)\n\u201cBefore I even had the chance to crack open New Bedford, the game caught my attention because someone had mentioned that it was like a more concise and elegant version of Le Havre. While I\u2019ll agree that the two games do share some similarities, saying that New Bedford is essentially Le Havre light does it a great disservice. New Bedford offers its own unique experience that feels fresh and not borrowed.\u201d - Kyle Chivers, Euro Board Game Blog (click to read his full review) \n\"New Bedford does a lot of things right - but the best thing about the game is that it is one of those games that is easy to both learn and teach, but will surprise you with its depth after you dive in for subsequent plays.\" - James Flemming, Board Game Reviews by Josh (click to read his full review) \n\u201cBeyond the theme, I like New Bedford for several game-play reasons.  I am reminded of Puerto Rico from the standpoint that players can score through the staple process of whaling as well as from buying buildings to augment the town of New Bedford.  Likewise, New Bedford includes the worker-placement-building quality of Le Havre with buildings that facilitate collecting materials, constructing buildings, or sending out whaling ships.  I actually find New Bedford cleaner and more elegant than Le Havre.\u201d - Paul Owen, Man Overboard (click to see more comments)\n\u201cSolid worker placement game. The two different elements to the game, building the village and the whaling, complement each other nicely. I got to play this at Grand Con at an Unpub event. Multiple victory paths and some interesting combos can be made with some of the village tiles. Can't wait for this one to come out.\u201d - David Taylor, To the Table\n\u201cWhen I played New Bedford when it was printer paper and glue I fell in love with the concept and game play.  Now that I see the final product the game has been brought to life in a whole new way and still sits in my top five to play as two player with my hubby or with a group of friends!\u201d - Lesley Louder, The Chalkboard Gamer\n\"New Bedford has all the strategizing of a game like Agricola without the stress. It wonderfully meshes worker placement, town building, and tile drawing in such a way that it plays fast without comprising any depth.\u201d  - Scott King, game photographer and blogger\n\"Such a smooth, engaging gaming experience. New Bedford is a great low-cost-of-entry euro that has enough game for game night, but is still completely accessible for my family.\" - Matt Riddle, co-designer of Fleet and person of no consequence\n\"When I played this game at an Unpub over a year ago, I was unsure if I would like a game about whaling.  That was quickly proven wrong, and I told Nat when he was done with New Bedford I wanted a copy of it.\"  - Derrick Vidal, Baked Fresh Daily Games\n\n\u201cFrom the moment I sat down with New Bedford and took my first turn, I knew that I was seeing something special. While I\u2019ve had the privilege of playing several games in the Unpub program, only a few of them make me want to drop money on the spot. New Bedford was exactly that. The cool thing is, I\u2019ve only seen it get even better! Take my money now!\u201d - Greg Miller, Baked Fresh Daily Games\n\"One of those rare occasions where everyone at the table was lost in the world and loving every minute.\" - Josh Mills, game designer\nWithout our Kickstarter Backers, Dice Hate Me Games would not be able to bring quality games to market. To show our respect and appreciation, DHMG promises that backer copies of New Bedford will be shipped out before copies are available for purchase at retailers or conventions. DHMG also pledges to keep all backers informed at every step in the development, printing and delivery processes. We love staying in touch with all of our supporters, so please never hesitate to contact us with questions and concerns.\nNew Bedford\u2019s design was influenced by a time when whaling was a part of daily life - and that eventually lead to a modern crisis for many species of whales. To make it clear, we don\u2019t condone modern whaling. But we think that the history of New Bedford and the whaling industry is an important subject. Just like our chemistry game, Compounded, we believe that games designed for entertainment can also be educational - and, in this case, foster discussion about a controversial topic. For more information on modern whaling and conservation efforts, please check out the overview from the World Wildlife Fund.\nWe knew that the theme of historic whaling could be considered a bit controversial by some, but we believe in New Bedford and in the theme. As Herman Melville once wrote about his novel, Moby-Dick, \"To produce a mighty book, you must choose a mighty theme.\" We think New Bedford is a mighty little game, and we are proud to present it to all of you. \nThanks, as always, for the continued support for Dice Hate Me Games from our Kickstarter family. You continue to amaze and humble us.\nLet's keep sailing,\nChris & Nat", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs with any project that involves the production and manufacture of a good to be delivered, there is certainly a real chance for hiccups, delays and more than one or two gremlins gumming up the works along the way.

We try to plan for all contingencies, and have worked through - and learned from - any kinks encountered in our past projects.\n\nWe won't lie - stuff happens. Delays can occur. Sometimes you have to go back and forth on color samples six times just to get the color right, and even then the color isn't perfect. Sometimes even personal life events can blindside you. But what we do promise is that we will hold ourselves to the same high standards we expect from other board game publishers, and we will be completely honest and open with each of you every step of the way.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Dice Hate Me Games\n20 created \u00b7 2 backed\nDice Hate Me Games, LLC is a division of Greater Than Games, LLC, committed to bringing entertaining, innovative, and challenging games to...See more"}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #10", "update_userinfo": "We're Back and Even Better!", "update_content": "Greetings Historical Gamers,\nWe're proud to announce that we've launched a new campaign for New Bedford!"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #9", "update_userinfo": "Ship's Log: Postmortem", "update_content": "Greetings historical gamers,\nAs most of you have no doubt noticed by now, the campaign for New Bedford has been cancelled.

Hunt", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Sunrise City has received many glowing reviews since its release in 2012, and I am very pleased to present Sunrise City: Nights!, the first full expansion for this much loved game. Isaias Vallejo, the designer, set out to bring a little bit of the night-life and casino flavor to the base game and to add a couple of fun mechanics to what many have called a \"New Classic\" board game.\nTake a look at all the components below...cards, tiles, meeples, stars, a chip and a custom die. It's all in Sunrise City: Nights!\nWith only 3 pieces of card art completed we've got 13 pieces open for custom backer art. Do you want to be a part of Sunrise City? Well you can, just take a look at the pledge levels to the right.\nOne of the first things people notice about the Sunrise City game is the THICK building tiles, so I'm happy to say that Sunrise City: Nights! has 20 new THICK building tiles in a new smaller \"One Zone\" size.\nAll of this and, if the pledge total climbs high enough, four more Role Cards will be added to every copy of the expansion through the stretch goals shown a little bit further down this page. \nBack when I printed Sunrise City, I had promo packs made for the backers of the first Kickstarter campaign.  Well, since this is a new Sunrise City Kickstarter project, I'm putting those exclusives in here as exclusives again.\nEveryone who pledges for one of the reward levels in this project will also get these four Role Cards and five negative-points Community Tiles.\nThe Sunrise City: Nights! expansion already has 16 new Role Cards, but if the funding goes over the $9,000 goal, I've got four more new Role Cards waiting in the wings. Let's see if we can make it happen!\nSunrise City Base Game\nYou can download the base game rules here.\nThere have been a lot of reviews of Sunrise City and most reviews also include a rules recap. One of the most enthusiastic rules/review videos comes from Dan King at the Dice Tower\nNights! Expansion\nThe Sunrise City: Nights! expansion gives you more of what you love most in the base game. \nThe 16 new Role Cards give you more customizable player powers and more options for bending the rules to your advantage.\nTwo new meeple Roles have a familiar feel but their ability to block your opponents is stronger and one meeple even moves through the city, changing its blocking power as it roams.\nThe silver Benchmark Tokens are worth 5pts each so you'll never run out of stars.\nNights! also introduces two new game systems to enhance the game and add a casino-feel to your city-building adventure.\nEach player starts the game with a set of five special One-Zone Building (OZB) Tiles that they can play over the course of the game. They play just like any other Building Tile but their size lets them fill in isolated zones or fit neatly onto the edge of a growing skyscraper. OZBs also present new scoring methods based on the current configuration of the city so their potential effect on your score and the city itself, is different each time they're played.\nThe Fortune Die is a six-sided die with the red, green, blue and yellow on four sides and purple on two sides. Certain Role Cards and new Building Tiles use the Fortune Die to create a casino-feel with probability-base rewards.\nClick here to read the Sunrise City: Nights! expansion rules to see just how it all works.\nBack in April 2011, Chris Kirkman from Dice Hate Me interviewed Sunrise City designer, Isaias Vallejo. The text below is reprinted with permission from DHM and you can read the full article here.\nThe idea for the game is definitely inspired by Sim City. While doing the initial development, some other games inspired me: Medici (on iPhone), Metropolys, Caylus, and Carson City. The motivation to create the game came from Jack Neal's Quick Print n\u2019 Play Design Contest on the BoardGameGeek.com forums. \nThe game evolved quite quickly, which was exciting, but unfortunately, although I didn\u2019t know it at the time, it was evolving in the wrong direction. I was one edit away from adding in useless mathematical (taxes/rent) mechanics when David MacKenzie from Clever Mojo Games jumped on the forum thread. Luckily for me, he invited me to his weekly play-testing Meetup group and asked if he could take a look at the game in person.\nWhen I went over to David\u2019s Fortress of Solitude (a mecca for a fledgling designer such as myself) with Drew Sayers, my design partner, we were lucky enough to have David all to ourselves while the other play-testers played a different game. We went through the game according to the rules at the time and it quickly became evident that the game was slow, boring, and wasn\u2019t achieving its objective: laying down buildings. David suggested some (a lot of) changes and we quickly scrapped a lot of the things that were holding us back. We basically designed as we played the next game and it instantly felt a lot better.\nWith those changes we had a new rule set and goal for the game: to make a fun filler game you can play during a lunch hour. After that session, I came back a few more times and played the game with others and I guess David liked it enough to start asking about publishing the game. Or I insisted he publish it. Either way, we were on our way to making a great game together.\nThe Dice Tower\nYou already saw one Dice Tower review above, but Ryan Metzler, Scott Fera, and Tom Vasel ALL did reviews too.  That's FOUR reviews from the same organization for the same game. To borrow some words from Sally Field, \"They like it; they really like it!\"\nMaybe these three video reviews aren't enough to convince you that Sunrise City is a great game. Well, I have a few more you can check out, too...\nSeveral Reviews in English\nTwo In German\nAnd Twice More in Polish\nUnboxing Videos from GMS Magazine, Proper Play, and a Canadian\nAn unboxing video is a great way to get a close up look at the components, but Paco at GMS hadn't played the game yet when he shot this video, so some of the rules he suppose from components are not actually the way the game plays...so enjoy the component discussion, but take Paco's rules commentary with a grain of salt.\nAnd if you're STILL not convinced, you can click over for 18 written reviews over at BoardGameGeek.com.\nClever Mojo Games and Game Salute stand behind the quality and enjoyment of Sunrise City and Sunrise City: Nights!

Scientists will have to keep a close eye on the Geiger counter, because as productivity in the lab increases, so does the chance for radioactivity levels to soar dangerously high.\nThe Geiger Expansion introduces a new, interactive paradigm to the base game of Compounded, as players will now sometimes have to work together to eliminate or reduce the threat of radioactivity. Of course, those players with a propensity for causing chaos will have even more methods at their disposal, ensuring that each game will be exciting and dynamic.\nThe Geiger Expansion will be chock full of new things to add to the level of fun - and danger - in your lab.\nFirst off, there are three new elements that will affect the game in different ways. \nRadium is a rare element that is pulled from the elements bag like the six base elements. It can be stored on a scientist's work bench and used to complete radioactive compounds, or processed into Lead that is used in completing other valuable compounds. Finally, Polonium is an extremely radioactive element that, when pulled from the element bag, increases the radioactivity levels in the lab. More Polonium is added to the bag as scientists make progress in completing elements moving along the score track. \nNext, the Geiger counter is used to track the lab's radioactivity levels. As the levels progress, elements are tainted by the radioactivity every round and a few are removed from the elements bag. When radioactivity reaches a certain level, lab fires break out \u2013 and if radioactivity levels grow too high, it is too dangerous for scientists to work and the lab is shut down. Scientists may work together during the game to help manage the radioactivity levels, or create a bit of mayhem by selectively completing compounds that raise the radioactivity.\nThe Geiger Expansion also includes new compounds that may grant scientists additional tools - like Calcium Hydride and Ethenone - or require Radium and Lead to complete - like Radium Nitride or Lead Sulfide. Stay tuned for project updates that will show off new cards with new Chemical Reactions and new abilities!\nFinally, scientists will receive a work bench extension with room to store the new tools they may acquire during the game. Scientists can track the decay chain of any Radium that they are decaying into Lead. At one point in the process Helium is released, which scientists may use as a Wild Element during the game. \nWhat's included:\n- 47 new Compound Cards\n- Thick punchboard Geiger counter\n- 12 Helium tokens\n- 8 Radiation tokens\n- 2 new Lab Tools (total of 8 new punchboard tokens)\n- 25 Elements (12 Radium, 8 Lead, 5 Polonium)\n- 5 Work Bench extensions\nAnd, yes, everything inside the Geiger Expansion will fit inside the main Compounded box!\nIn case you're not familiar with the original base game of Compounded, it was successfully funded on Kickstarter in February of 2013. Because of the help of wonderful Kickstarter backers, we at Dice Hate Me Games were able to produce 5,000 units. Compounded was released for retail sale in November of 2013, and sold out in April of 2014 (except for a few personal copies which are available in the ALL THE THINGS RIGHT NOW pledge level). With your help and support of this Kickstarter campaign, we can afford to print a second edition of the game, ensuring that even more gamers will be able to bring Compounded to their lab table.\nCompounded is a game about building chemical compounds through careful management of elements, a fair bit of social play and trading, and just a bit of luck. In Compounded, players take on the roles of lab managers, hastily competing to complete the most compounds before they are completed by others \u2013 or destroyed in an explosion. Some compounds are flammable and will grow more and more volatile over time; take too long to gather the necessary elements for those compounds and a lot of hard work will soon be scattered across the lab.\nAlthough Compounded does involve a fair share of press-your-luck tension and certainly some strategic planning, the most successful scientists will often be those who strike a good trade with their fellow lab mates. Players are able to freely trade elements, laboratory tools and even favors \u2013 if there is truly honor among chemists!\nIf you'd like to know more about Compounded you can check out a gameplay video, rules and more at dicehatemegames.com.\nThis mini-expansion for Compounded that introduced a bit more chaotic fun to the lab was a promotional for backers of the original Compounded Kickstarter project. We have since sold or given them away as convention promos, and recently made the mini-expansion available for purchase online. For every pledge that includes a copy of the base game of Compounded, we'll include a copy of Chemical Chaos, as well!\nAchieving our base funding goal now ensures that Dice Hate Me Games will be able to publish the Geiger Expansion and the second edition of Compounded with the quality that we all have come to expect. Now that we've exceed that goal, we can bring out stretch goals!\nStretch goal number one has been passed! We'll now add 10 wooden Flame Cubes to every Geiger Expansion box! A lot of you were clamoring for a flame token upgrade in the first campaign, and it was always our intent to revisit the idea. But with so many other great stretch goals we never managed to find the time for these cubes to come back around. \nFlame Cubes were in the very first prototype for Compounded, and they\u2019ve always been a bit of a sentimental component for us. By putting them in the Geiger box it will allow us to upgrade components for the base game for both old and new owners of Compounded. \nWe've reached stretch goal #2! Since we've reached $55K, we'll make sure the wooden Flame Cubes have a companion piece - wooden Radiation Tokens! \n These tokens are used to mark radioactive compounds when they get a hot spike, much like when volatile compounds are exposed to a lab fire. Unlike when volatile compounds explode, when radioactive compounds get two Radiation Tokens, they are flipped upside down to create \"dead zones\" in the Research Field, limiting the amount of compounds that are available for completion. \nIn addition to the Radiation Tokens, we'll also add one new compound to the Geiger Expansion - Calcium Nitride. \n It's a tough little compound to complete, but when you do you receive 7 points and activate the Magnet Chemical Reaction which allows you to select any available tool from the tool section on the scoreboard. It can prove to be a pretty powerful and flexible reaction after you invest all that Calcium.\nWe've also reached our next milestone! \nSince we reached $65K, we can kick Radium and Polonium up a notch. How? Well, since they\u2019re radioactive, it\u2019s only fitting that they would glow in the dark! That\u2019s right, we\u2019ve checked with our manufacturer, Panda Games, and they can make those gems truly radioactive. It doesn\u2019t exactly add to gameplay, but it sure does pour on the theme.\nWe've reached our next stretch goal of $70K! We can now give every backer that pledges for GEIGER and above the promotional Methamphetamine Lab Partner card. This might explain our mysterious reference to something Heisenbergian in our stretch goal teasers.\nThis card will be a Kickstarter promotional that each backer may opt to receive as an extra, in addition to the expansion and game. That means that gamers who would rather not include Methamphetamine in their pledges will be asked if they\u2019d like to receive it in the survey that will be sent out after funding. This card will NOT be included in the base game or the Geiger Expansion - it is simply a promotional item for those that would like it.\nOur next stretch goal is super cool - and we've reached it! We can now create a Geiger counter with fully-movable dial!\nThe Geiger counter will now be comprised of four parts - the main Geiger counter punchboard, a dial made of punchboard, and a plastic connector that snaps the punchboard parts together. Scientists will now be able to move the dial instead of a token whenever the radiation levels rise in the lab! This is something we always wished we could add, and with this new stretch goal, we can finally do it.\nWe're pretty excited for our next stretch goal, as we have been toying with the idea of this since the Kickstarter campaign for the base game last year. We have always wanted to highlight some of the chemistry heroes throughout history, so since we reached $90K, we'll produce a pack of 5 Scientist cards for the Geiger Expansion box! These cards will be the same size as the Lab Partners cards, only oriented vertically. \nIn this variant, each player will randomly receive a scientist at the beginning of the game. Each scientist has a special ability that will benefit that particular player, as well as a global ability that affects the entire lab. We've shown you two of the scientists and their abilities above, and we'll be highlighting the other scientists over the next few days in updates. For the time being, we'll just tease to the other scientists in the expansion: Michael Faraday (invented the Bunsen Burner), Joseph Priestley (credited with the discovery of Oxygen), and John Dalton (pioneer of atomic theory and chemical reactions). Feel free to speculate on their powers and global abilities in the comments! Also, please bear in mind that the portrait art above is just placeholder art, for now. If we pass the stretch goal, we'll be contracting an artist for custom portraits of the scientists.\nSince we posted the last stretch goal, everyone has been super excited about the Scientist cards, and clamoring for more. We aim to please; If we pass $100K by the end of the campaign, we\u2019ll give everyone five more scientists! \nIn addition to Geiger and Mendeleev above, we\u2019ll also include cards for Rosalind Franklin (discovered molecular structures of DNA and viruses), George Washington Carver (revolutionized agricultural chemistry), and Emil Erlenmeyer (contributor to theory of structure and inventor of the Erlenmeyer flask). We\u2019ve enjoyed reading everyone\u2019s speculations as to the powers of the last scientists, so feel free to discuss what you think these other three might contribute to the game!\nWe have more stretch goals planned so keep spreading the news and let\u2019s keep the lab growing!\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a complex game. You don\u2019t need to know anything about chemistry to play it, at all. And I think it really fits a niche in which there are not enough games being put out there\u2026 This is a good game. I very much recommend it.\u201d - Tom Vasel (The Dice Tower)\n\u201cI love it! I haven\u2019t thought positively about chemistry since\u2026 high school.\u201d Eric Dow, Critical Plays (Crits Happen)\n\u201cYes, kids, high school chemistry can be fun\u2026 we like Compounded so much we\u2019re ranking it all the way up to the #2 spot (on their Top Ten Games list).\u201d Emily Duhigg (Getting Higgy With It)\n\"Compounded is a medium weight game full of scientific brilliance. The tag line on the box, \"Better gaming through Chemistry,\" sums it up beautifully. I couldn't have said it better myself. This game is fun for scientist of almost every age. I highly recommend it.\"Gaming Bits \n\"This has to be one of the most thematic games I have ever played. You really feel like a scientist gathering elements and creating compounds to complete experiments.\"J. Chris Miller\n\"The end result is a game that appeals to fans of lightweight resource management, families looking for a new game night addition, or even a game to potentially assist in educating students about science in a fun way. It focuses less on deeply complex moves and more on showing that Euros can be thematically rich with widespread appeal. (Especially if that focus is on something as awesome as science.)\" Cardboard Republic\nWell, here we are again - at the precipice of another great adventure together. I am so excited to present the first, official, \"big box\" expansion for one of our Dice Hate Me Games titles. Especially so since Compounded has been so well-received since its general release late last year. \nThe past three years with everyone on Kickstarter and in the board gaming hobby have been absolutely amazing, and there is so much more in store as long as you all continue to come along for the ride. The Geiger Expansion not only expands on a great game \u2013 it also expands on the dream that is Dice Hate Me Games in so many ways, and I cannot wait to share it all with you. It has been an incredible journey because of all of our wonderful backers, and I appreciate each and every one of you, both old and new.\nLet's go make some magic - or science. I'm good either way.\nAll the best,\nChris", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs with any project that involves the production and manufacture of a good to be delivered, there is certainly a real chance for hiccups, delays and more than one or two gremlins gumming up the works along the way. Many boardgame projects on Kickstarter have been seriously hampered by art production delays, problems with an overseas factory, missing units and one shipping snafu after another.\n\nLuckily, we have a few projects under our belt, and have dealt with many of those snafus and gremlins along the way. We have a good working relationship with three of our overseas manufacturers and have become accustomed to their protocols, communication styles and general idiosyncrasies. We try to plan for all contingencies.\n\nWe won't lie, though - stuff happens. Delays can occur. Sometimes you have to go back and forth on color samples six times just to get the color right, and even then the color isn't perfect. But what we do promise is that we will hold ourselves to the same high standards we expect from other board game publishers, and we will be completely honest and open with each of you every step of the way.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #27", "update_userinfo": "Compounded and Geiger are shipping!", "update_content": "Hey, chemistry fans!\nWe have some really exciting news for you.

Features hand-lettered calligraphy in the style of an antique scientific chart. Postcard will be signed by Rob Balder.\nMagnetic postcard design\nThinkamancy Pin\nPROJECT EXCLUSIVE! 1-1/4 inch metal cloisonne lapel pin in the design of Maggie\u2019s Thinkamancy pendant:\nSurface will be bright gold metallic, with black and white enamel details. Same size and quality as the Battle Crest Lapel Pins:\nThe Thinkamancy pins will never be for sale. We will only make as many as we need to fulfill donor rewards (plus a handful for the Team Erfworld folks).\n3 Issue Set\nPrinted in softcover as we went along, the issues of Book 2 contain all comic pages and text updates posted to the site, plus exclusive features. These are 8-1/2 x 11\u201d full color perfect-bound books. You get:\nIssue 1: Meet the Jetstones (60 pages, includes Xin\u2019s initial character drawings)   \nIssue 2: It\u2019s Raining Men (94 pages, includes Thinkamancer profiles)\nIssue 3: Lots of Sects, and Violence (54 pages, includes Wanda dress-up dolls)\nSummer updates and epilogues are not included in these volumes.\nHardcover Book\nHuge, heavy, and all-inclusive. See \u201cBook 2 Facts\u201d for more information about Love is a Battlefield.\nSigned Original Art\n\nYou will receive one panel of original penciled art from Erfworld Book 3: Hamsterdance vs. the Charlie Foxtrot, drawn and signed by David Hahn. This will be the actual art used in the book, so it may be a year or more before your piece of art is sent to you. However, we will not delay the rest of your donor rewards. You will receive the art separately when it becomes available.\n\nNOTE: All reward tiers $400 and above receive this item!\nParson Figurine\nHand-painted, 6-inch tall figurine of Lord Hamster himself, looking ready for a fight. These will be made in a run of 500 pieces and will never be re-cast. Material is high quality resin. Each is individually boxed, with its own plastic base.\nDrawing of You + Character\nUsing photos you send us, David Hahn will draw a picture of your Erfly counterpart, standing with your favorite Erfworld character (Charlie excluded :P). You will receive the signed original pencils, and these will appear on the Erfworld site at some point. When the new website launches, these images will appear in your user lookup.\nCharacter Profile\nUsing photos and information you send us about yourself, Rob Balder will write up a stats sheet and character backstory for your counterpart character in Erfworld. This will resemble the Thinkamancer profiles from Issue 2. Example:\nDavid Hahn will create an illustration of this character, and you will receive his signed, original pencil art. This character sheet will be posted on the main page at Erfworld.com, and when the new site launches it will appear in your user lookup. You will also get a special \u201cCANONIZED\u201d site trophy at the new website, available only to those who have inspired canon elements of the Erfworld universe.\nShort Story\nRob Balder will write a short story about an Erfworld character inspired by you, based on photos and information you share about your life, personality, etc. This story will be at least 5000 words long, and will appear in its entirety at Erfworld.com. You will receive a printed copy of your story, signed by Rob. Also, David Hahn will draw a story illustration featuring this character, and you will receive his signed pencils.\nAn example of such a story, written for Curtis Shaw, a previous Kickstarter donor\nWhen the new website launches, a featured link to your story will appear in your user lookup, and you will get the \u201cCANONIZED\u201d site trophy.\n\n(For legal clarity: the copyright to this story will belong to Rob, but you will have an unlimited lifetime license to print, copy, distribute or publish your story and its accompanying art in any way you like. You will not receive royalties or other compensation from the publication of this story, but you will be credited and thanked.)\nNovella\nSame as \u201cShort Story\u201d above, but the story will be at least 21,000 words long. Here\u2019s an example, written for Doug Molla for his previous Kickstarter donations.\nBOOK 3 - the financial realities\nWhen Jamie Noguchi and I started Erfworld, we were both working on speculation that the comic might grow into something. Neither of us made any money during the first three years until there was a book to sell.\nWhen Xin took over for Jamie, she opted to work for future royalties, rather than being paid by the page. That was helpful for us from a business standpoint, but in her case and Jamie\u2019s both, it was a factor in keeping to a schedule.\nNow we have David, who is a working professional comics illustrator who works on an industry-competitive page rate. That means we\u2019ll be better able to keep Erfworld to a regular update schedule. But it also means that if we want art, we need to have the funds up front to pay for it.\nSo we\u2019re ready to start producing Book 3: Hamsterdance vs. the Charlie Foxtrot right now, but I can\u2019t start writing it, because I don\u2019t know what kind of book it will be. That will depend directly on your support for this project.\nOur little fictional world needs two things to exist: the hard work & creative willpower of Team Erfworld, and the participation & support of Erfworld's readers and fans.\nThere are more stories being told now, more creative dreams being pursued, more authors and artists and filmmakers asking for your contributions than at any time in history. It's up to you to decide what gets made. We think that we're doing something here that's worthwhile, and we'll continue making Erfworld as long as we're able, or until the story says, \"The End.\" We hope you believe in us, and that you'll help us continue.\n\nThank you,\nRob Balder, for Xin and David and Linda and the rest of Team Erfworld", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe made some rookie mistakes in our first big project in 2012. As a lot of Kickstarter creators have found out, it\u2019s too easy to overreach and over-promise.\n\nBy now, we\u2019ve fulfilled all the promised donor rewards for the Year of the Dwagon project (except DVDs, which are pending the eventual video), but most of our stated creative ambitions haven\u2019t yet been met. Our ideas about what it would take to make a motion comic of Book 1 and to build our dream website turned out to be far too optimistic. We also made the huge mistake of not funding the hardcover printing of Book 1. A quarter of the funds raised had to be applied to that, just to fulfill the donor rewards.\n\nWith our second and third projects, we were determined to keep things under control and realistic. We did a much better job with E is for Erfworld and Battle Crest Pins, in terms of meeting our promises to our supporters and ourselves. All rewards for both of those projects have been sent out, and all of our creative/production goals have been met. Both projects are successfully closed.\n\nFor this fourth project, we\u2019re incorporating everything we\u2019ve learned from the previous three. Costs are known, the kinks are worked out of our fulfillment process, and our creative ambitions mostly amount to \u201cplease let us continue making Erfworld for you.\u201d If the support comes in to fund us, then this project should be the smoothest one yet.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #21", "update_userinfo": "Need a 10 minute hero", "update_content": "So I mentioned in previous updates that we wanted to try an EU fulfillment service for our backer rewards as a way to reduce the monstrous postage on these items.

If you discover Tuscany after the project ends, you can order the retail version of the game (it\u2019s the same version you see here) on the Stonemaier Games website.\nThe creators of Euphoria bring you Tuscany, a pack of 12 expansions to Viticulture that unlock (\"uncork\") every few games as determined by the previous game's winner. What story will you tell as you create the most successful vineyard in Tuscany?\nViticulture is a 2-6 player game in which you create a vineyard by planting vines, harvesting grapes, making & selling wine, building structures, and hosting visitors. \nTuscany adds asymmetric starting resources, new visitor cards, an extended board, special workers, Arboriculture, and more (see rules and playtest PnP).\nTuscany cannot be played without Viticulture, which is available in several reward levels and as a $49 add-on. To learn more about Viticulture, you can download the rules, print and play it, watch videos about it, read some reviews, or view it on BGG.\nPrototype meeples created by PiasaPro.com\nYou can use the handy Fundafull pledge calculator to figure out your total pledge cost. Euphoria will remain on sale on our website until this project ends.\nAll stretch goals are fully playtested and are included in every copy of Tuscany (Kickstarter and retail).\nThanks to the worldwide fulfillment system explained on our Kickstarter Lessons blog here and here, we have very cost-effective ways of shipping Tuscany to you.\nWe can ship games to you in bulk if you coordinate a group purchase. Just choose your reward level and add the cost of each additional game to your pledge. Only pay the shipping fee once per pledge (any # of games, reward level, or country code).\nBackers in Asia, Australia, and New Zealand are likely to get their games a little earlier than everyone else because we'll ship their games from China (bulk or direct).\nFind all media mentions of Tuscany on our website and join the discussion about the game on BoardGameGeek.\nGeekDad prototype review by Dave Banks\nBoard Game Quest written preview\nThe Cardboard Republic written preview\nLeague of Gamemakers written preview\nTheology of Games written preview\nThanks to the multitude of amazing playtesters around the world who gave us their feedback on Tuscany! Anyone who playtests the game and gives us feedback will get their name in the rulebook.\nMoney-Back Guarantee: If you decide you don\u2019t like Tuscany within 1 month of receiving it, you can return it for a full pledge refund (see FAQ for details).\nEarly-Adopter Discount: Every copy of Tuscany ($45) comes at a 36% discount off MSRP ($70) as an appreciation of your early support.\nLimited Availability: We don't do Kickstarter exclusives anymore, but we'll only print a limited number of certain rewards based on the final pledge totals.\nWe Listen: We treat backers as collaborators\u2014we really value your input, and we promptly and transparently address all questions and concerns.\nBecause We Need You: We\u2019ve covered the cost of graphic design and art for Tuscany, but we can\u2019t manufacture and ship the game without your support.\nRough sketch of the collector's edition cardboard box (illustrated to look like wood). It measures approximately 10.5x8.5x8 inches and can sit upright or on its side.\nUncork all expansions in each tier in any order before opening the next tier. Here are the playtest rules and PnP (no graphic design on PnP).\nTier 1\nMamas and Papas: These cards give each player different combinations of starting resources to create varied priorities in the early game.\nPatronage: These cards give each player an incentive to make wine and a secret goal to accomplish, encouraging a diversity of strategies from game to game and a grand reveal at the end of each game.\nAdvanced Visitors: These cards offer players a variety of abilities that are good at all times of the game (most of these cards are in the format \"Choose 1: A or B,\" where A is good early in the game and B is good late in the game).\nProperty: These tiles overlay the fields on all vineyard mats and feature different maximum vine values and the ability to sell unused fields for money.\nTier 2\nExtended Game Board: This is a full game board with a new wake-up chart that creates a continuous flow from season to season and year to year, an influence map that lets players grab resources early and points late, and full worker-placement options in all four seasons, including several new actions.\nSpecial Workers: Similar to the grande workers, the special worker meeples are regular workers with one special ability each. This gives players the ability to not only choose where they place workers, but also which worker they will place.\nNew Visitors: Many of these cards let players break the rules of the game or generate interactions and tough choices for opponents to make.\nStructures: Flip over the extended board to side 2 and you'll find a number of orange card icons on it. They represent a new set of 36 structures that you can build on your vineyard and your new construction mat. They're drawn from a deck of cards (just like visitors or vines), and you build them with the build action. Every structure offers special ongoing bonuses and new action spaces, forming your strategy in a different way each game.\nTier 3\nArboriculture: This expansion gives players the ability to plant and harvest tomato vines, apple trees, and olive trees, create refined goods, and sell those goods with wine orders for points. Due to the extra strain on your workers, you have to keep an eye on their morale, which can either benefit or hinder you.\nFormaggio: The cheese expansion give players access to cows and four types of cheese to age in a cheese cellar. Several types of cheese experts are available on each player mat to impact the value of your cheese.\nMafia: In the mafia expansion, players are trying to present the best gift to a retired capo who is building his holiday home in Tuscany. Each grande worker carries your hidden gift, but if two grande workers end up on the same action, they have to switch gifts.\nThe Automa Expansion adds a set of cards to the game that lets you play Viticulture and Tuscany solo in campaign mode with varying degrees of difficulty.\nPhotos include prototype components. The final Farmer meeple (pictured with a staff) will not have a staff.\nWe faced a key decision when we started designing expansions to Viticulture: We could release expansions over the course of several years. That's what most game companies do, and we respect that strategy. Or we could do something different.\nWe decided to try something new: create an entire expansion experience while also offering people the best value for their money. Thus the idea for the Tuscany expansion pack: 12 expansions in one box.\nIt is a little odd for Tuscany to have a higher MSRP than Viticulture, but Tuscany costs more to make than Viticulture. To be fiscally responsible, we have to account for the fact that distributors purchase games at 60% off MSRP.\nIMMORTALE ($149): There are 32 new visitor cards in Tuscany, and we've divided them into two groups of 16 for gender equality. If you choose this level, you will need to take a photo specifically for your digital painting by Beth Sobel. \nEach visitor represents an adult who contributes to the needs of the vineyard, so the person on the card must be an adult (one person per card). These Immortale cards will be included in every Kickstarter copy of Tuscany.\nWe like to support game stores and wineries around the world by offering the special Kickstarter versions of our games to retailers during the campaign. If you're a retailer, please see our retail guidelines here and contact Jamey directly about your pledge.\nThis project is specifically to raise funds to make Tuscany. Independently, we are also printing second-edition copies of Viticulture--those files have already been submitted to the printer for pre-production. \nIn August, Viticulture will reach retailers, people who pre-order through our website, and backers who select Viticulture as an add-on (instead of the consolidated $79 and $99 rewards). We're able to offer those low prices by shipping Viticulture and Tuscany together in November, but if you want Viticulture in August, you may add it to any reward level (even the $1 level) for $49 or pre-order through our website.\nThe 2nd edition of Viticulture incorporates several rules changes, including the addition of the grande workers. These updated components are standard in every second-edition copy of Viticulture, and we will provide them for free in the Tuscany box for any current Viticulture owners (we'll ask you in the post-KS backer survey). We're trying to limit the number of upgraded components we mail individually to current Viticulture owners because of the expense and logistics involved, but we'll try to accommodate everyone as best as possible.\nphotos used with permission from boardgamegeek.com reviewer EndersGame\nEuphoria (retail version) is not available as an add-on, but you can order it from our website for immediate shipment during this campaign at a discounted price while supplies last (sorry, we only have copies in the US and Canada at this point, so shipping elsewhere is expensive). The Kickstarter version of Euphoria is not available. We will be offering special \"realistic\" resources in the near future\u2014you can subscribe to our e-newsletter for notification.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nTuscany is a first for us in that it is our first attempt at an expansion to an existing game. Fortunately we have an ever-growing number of local and worldwide playtesters who offered us feedback over the course of the development process.\n\nThe main challenges we experienced with Euphoria that we will learn from are:\n\n(a) Amazon fulfillment isn't perfect, and occasionally a box might arrive slightly damaged (this happened on about 20 out of 5,000 copies of Euphoria delivered via Amazon fulfillment). For Tuscany we'll print replacement boxes to send to backers if needed.\n\n(b) In games with a myriad of components, sometimes a component doesn't make it into the box for a small percentage of the games. Thanks to a number of helpful Stonemaier ambassadors worldwide, we are able to get replacement parts to backers within a few days, and we've worked with our manufacturer to reduce the chances of missing parts for the future.\n\nThanks to our experience with Viticulture and Euphoria, we know exactly what goes into creating a high-quality game and delivering it on time. Stonemaier Games now has a worldwide supply chain set up to ensure punctual and cost-effective delivery to backers in almost every country. We're still learning, but we're slowly adding to our track record of success from Viticulture and Euphoria. We're also working with the same manufacturer again (Panda GM), so we know exactly what they need to produce quality product on schedule.\n\nWe tend to invest everything we earn from Kickstarter into making the best game possible. Any extra cash flow we have is from retail sales, which we are funneling into the second printing of Viticulture.\n\nStonemaier Games established an advisory board of industry veterans in January '13 to help us mitigate risks and challenges. So even though we will surely face new challenges in the future, we have an incredible team of experienced advisors to point us in the right direction.\n\nIf you would like to know more about what we learned from our Kickstarter experiences and research, go to www.stonemaiergames.com to see 80+ Kickstarter Lessons to help you create a successful project too.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #47", "update_userinfo": "Viticulture Moor Visitors Expansion", "update_content": "Hi!

You cast fireballs and cause d3 wounds.....d3 wounds? Where is your d3? Has this or similar ever happened to you? As a long time tabletop wargamer I have been frustrated by this often. Sure you can just roll a 6 sided dice and either count 1-2 as 1, 3-4 as 2, and 5-6 as 3 or even just keep rolling until you get a 1, 2 or 3. But there is just something about this that doesn't seem right. So finally one night I decided to create a working three sided dice. Have any of you ever tried the down right laughable d3s already out there? Like the one shaped like a pyramid that rolls even worse or the long triangles that have 2 sides with no numbers and therefore must be re-rolled if it lands on them then you know that a true d3 does not exist. Until now that is!\nWhat is it?\nBroken Arrow Games is proud to bring you the first real working d3. A simple design shaped kinda like a bean. Rounded on all but 3 flat sides opposite the numbers so only the 1, 2,or 3 can point up. \nLarge 1 inch dice.\nSmall 19mm dice.\nBecause of the rounded nature of the dice they roll very well and make cheating impossible. The flat sides also left some room to have interesting designs and markings. The ones you see are my prototype dice I hand-made out of wood the real ones will be made from acrylic, they roll and bounce very well. The colors are red and blue so far with equal amounts sent in each order ie: an order of 6 dice will get you 3 red and 3 blue dice.\nSizes\nThere are 2 different sizes shown but only one will go into production. There will be a running poll to decide the final size. To vote just message or email which size you would rather have after you back the project. We will keep a running tally with who voted for which size and update a pie chart daily to show the results. Why are we limiting the campaign to only one size? The cost of each mold is around $1300.00 so we can not afford both molds. \n1 inch on left 19mm on right\nThis is a pic of the dice next to a standard six sided 19mm dice.\nSize tally\nDay 24 is done! No change today. Note- for those of you who have not voted to be fair we will send out a poll to everyone to get final votes to decide the winner.\nIts Fudging Time\nPLAY\n\nThe fudge dice has arrived! After getting many requests for fudge dice here they are. These are the wooden hand-made prototype dice I made to see how well they work. The ones you receive will be made from acrylic like a standard dice. As fudge dice are designed to only have 3 outcomes the D3 is the perfect match for them and games that use them. A plus side, minus side, and blank side they roll and bounce very well. They are red and blue only for the demos, the real ones will be made with many different colors to choose from. The color options will be posted soon.\nChainmail Dice Bag\nCarry your unique dice in style with a chainmail dice bag. Each dice bag is made from over 700 machine cut bright aluminum 16 gauge chainmail links. They are over 7 inches long and can hold a whopping 200+ 16mm dice! Each bag is topped with a leather strap 'black/brown' for easy carrying and fastening shut. I have been making chainmail armor for years and each bag will be hand made by me.\nDragonscale Dice Bag\nChainmail not cool enough for you? Want something truly unique that only a very few will ever have? Then look no further as these Dragonscale dice bags will be hand-made to your color choice. Choose either all 1 color or any 2 stripped as in the picture.\nThis is not my bag. Used as an example.\nYour color options.\nOnly 100 will ever be made! Each bag will have a numbered plaque with your name on it as its base inside the bag. You get to pick the color of the plaque and your name/title.\nMy name as an example\nThe scales will be knitted together with black thread so the inside of the bag will be soft and smooth to not scratch anything inside. Fastened at the top with a black leather strap for easy closing, opening, and hanging. A serious collectors item for those of you who come to kickstarter to get something unique not found anywhere else. Note -  the reward tier says only 99. That is not a typo bag number 100 is saved for a special upcoming event. Details soon.\nStretch Goals\n$4,000.00 - +1 dice roll to all Let Lady Luck Decide orders\n$5,000.00 - +2 dice to all non-bulk (High Roller) orders\n$6,000.00 - +6 dice to all bulk (High Roller) orders\n$7,000.00 - +1 dice roll to all Let Lady Luck Decide Orders\n$8,000.00 - +1 dice to all non-bulk (High Roller) orders\n$9,000.00 - +4 dice to all bulk (High Roller) orders\nThe future\nBroken Arrow Games is a game designing company my girlfriend and I made to showcase the games we've been making for a few years. This is our first game piece design so we look forward and welcome any comments you may have either on the dice themselves or additions to our campaign. Being new to kickstarter we learn as we go and will be reinvesting in the kickstarter comunity by spending 5% of the profits on other kickstarter campaigns with http://kickingitforward.org/", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere is the risk that the product could be unsatisfactory. However, this is unlikely because:\n\n(a) It is a simple design (a solid piece of acrylic) \n(b) The production company I am using specializes in game pieces and dice \n(c) I will request to see the prototype that will be used to create the mold.\n\nBecause this product, like most nowadays, is coming from China, there could be a delay in delivery. That is why we have chosen the very safe delivery date of September. Of course we will ship the dice as soon as they are ready.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Broken Arrow Games\n2 created \u00b7 0 backed\nBroken Arrow Games is a new gaming company dedicated to making fun, fast-paced, and unique games.

That can be 6 of one kind or 4 fudge and 2 d3s or 3 of each kind. We will be emailing you to get your order preference at the end of the campaign.

Help spread the word around the more backers we get the more dice we can send you.

Throughout the world, the classic six-sided dice (d6) symbolize not only gaming, but also play and luck. \nSome say dice originated from the ankle bones of hoofed animals. But once the die developed into the pipped cube, the d6 stopped evolving.\nIsn't it time for a new spin on a classic? By making the d6 a dodecahedron, the die will not only roll better, but be more weight-balanced as opposing sides have the same number of engraved pips.\nDoublesix Dice can also be the perfect gateway accessory: Swap in your Doublesixes for the stale dice in your non-gamer friends' games (like Monopoly and Backgammon), and soon they will be wanting to take on Advanced D&D.\nIf you pledge to get your own Doublesix Dice and help this humble intiative, I pledge to provide you, in return, detailed transparency of the process, and satisfaction guaranteed (or your money back).\nWe will start with Black engraved pips on Ivory.

I plan to compensate Canadians and Mexican somehow (likely extra dice).\nINTELLECTUAL PROPERTY\nThough I thought of the idea myself, I discovered an expired patent (filed in 1982) on the exact same idea:\nhttp://www.google.com/patents/US4465279\n\nAs a measure of good faith, I had originally planned to donate 10% of the Kickstarter goal amount ($300) to the original patent holder, Roland Larson (or his charity of choice), if we were successful.  EDIT: Turns out that Kickstarter forbids this, so this will not be happening.\nBecause the patent is expired, no one, including myself, can patent the idea again, so it is fair game to all.

Hunt", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "THIS PROJECT HAS ENDED. HOWEVER...\n www.JapaneseTheGame.com\nI lived in Japan a decade ago and, through hard experience and hard work, I learned how the Japanese Language works.  I had taken college classes, tried to study on my own, and even moved there, but I was still struggling to say everyday things like \"That soup was delicious,\" and \"Actually, I'm too short to play football.\" Eventually I got a good grasp of the language and got rather fluent, but I felt terrible for the other English speakers who were new or never seemed to catch on.\nWhen I got back to the States, I saw that a lot of good programs like Rosetta Stone and Pimsleur were available for a whole lot of money and people were still buying them up, spending hundreds of dollars at a time. But what if you don't always have a computer or CD player with you, or what if you want to learn with friends? And learning certainly shouldn't be so expensive. So to make it easier for the rest of the world I cracked the code for you, breaking almost the whole language down into manageable concepts. It took a lot of time and failed attempts, but after six years of rethinking, simplifying, and revising, I've created this card game that makes learning Japanese fun, fast, and easy!\n The cards in this game have Japanese words on them, along with markings that help you put them together in complete, grammatically correct sentences every time. Here's an example sentence:\n These cards come together to make a sentence that means...\n...\"The cat sniffs.\"  Swap out nouns, verbs, etc., to make your own sentences.  Be smart or silly and have fun with it.\nAs you can see, the cards have English letters on them, so you don't have to know Japanese at all to play a fun, fast game and learn some Japanese vocabulary and grammar almost by accident. Here's a close-up sample of the card for Dog:\nThe First Edition will have fresh background images. A dog, for instance.\nThis game puts the language right in your hands, helping you learn at your own pace.  Even my 11-year-old cousin is pretty good at it. I want everyone who is interested in learning Japanese to be able to take a deck anywhere they go and share the Japanese language with their friends.\nFor students who happen to be learning the Japanese writing systems of Hiragana and Katakana or Kanji, this game is an excellent help. In fact, if you're studying Japanese, there's even a pledge level at which I will turn your vocabulary list into a deck! And you can get enough for your whole class, or have them join you in a pledge to pool your resources and benefit the whole class.  Each deck has 52 cards, which is enough for two players (because you need at least 25 cards per player).  The 36-cards expansions enable one more player to join the game while bringing you more vocabulary, grammar, and even strategic dimensions!\nThe game is played like a live-action version of Mad Libs.  The cards in your hand are words, and you use them to make sentences.  You can play with a shared deck or players can bring their own.\nSolo Mode - Build sentences to get to 20 points in as few turns as you can, or go until you've used every card in the deck!\nCollaborative Mode - Get together with a friend or two or three and take turns building, expanding, splitting, and re-building each other's sentences!\nCompetitive Mode - Every card you play can increase the number of points you have on your side of the table.  You can use the points you place on your side within a given turn to eliminate opponents' cards--end even complete sentences--to set them back while at the same time you make progress toward your own goal!  \nI've made a rather silly, roughly 10 minute-long video of this mode, which you can watch below. (You can get the feel of the game in about three minutes, though.) It may be a little loud depending on your computer.\nPLAY\n\nI believe breaking down the language barrier will increase love and understanding between Japanese and English-speaking cultures.  There is so much to be gained by bringing our world-leading cultures together in friendship.  So if you love games, love Japan, or love languages, it's time to learn, grow, and increase peace!\nI'm doing this Kickstarter to pay for printing the first complete edition of the game and six expansions: Japanese Food, Anime, Travel, Business, Monsters (Kaij\u016b), and an intermediate-level Conjugations Expansion!\nIf you want, the limited Sh\u014dgun backer level allows you to pick what words you want to be in a deck or expansion!  Do you want words to form a certain phrase?  \"You are my sunshine.\" \"What does the fox say?\" \"I am the one who knocks.\" \"Objection overruled.\"  You can have it!  The more funds we raise, the more cards we can put in the core deck and the more expansions we can afford to print.\nI will also use some funds to make a truly excellent series of free Japanese Instruction videos.  These lessons and question-and-answer sessions will allow learners to get more familiar with the language, regardless of whether they've even heard of the game.  Naturally I'll make videos for the game as well, but I feel like I've been given this amazing gift and I really want to share it.  For this, I'll need better video and sound equipment.\nThis is the updated break-down for the backer levels available in this Kickstarter:\nNote: The $1 Donation pledge level now gets a Print-and-Play First Edition Core Deck instead of the Beta because of a stretch goal we met.\nI hope this chart makes sense.  If it doesn't, please message me directly.\nWe've funded successfully, AND beaten our first through fourth stretch goals!\nUNLOCKED!! $7,000: A 5-card \"Politeness\" mini-expansion right inside the box that will enable you to make any sentence in the game into a Formal one.  That will make the Japanese teachers happy, along with everyone you meet if you should venture to the Land of the Rising Sun.\nUNLOCKED!! $20,000: Everyone who backs at $10 or more will get a Permanent Subscription to a Print-and-Play PDF of every Core Deck and expansions we ever make!  This will never happen outside of this Kickstarter campaign, so take advantage!\nUNLOCKED!! $25,000: I will add a blank sheet of cards to the Print-and-Play so you can make cards to suit your own vocabulary goals!\nUNLOCKED!! $42,000: I will make a Business Expansion with words like Office, Commute, Co-worker, etc.  More details here.\nUNLOCKED!! Reaching 1,000 Facebook Likes has unlocked a Free Android and iPhone app that reads your cards and speaks the native Japanese pronunciation!\nUNLOCKED!!: $64,000: We will get a MONSTERS (Kaijuu) EXPANSION with art by professional Japanese monster artist Micah Hornung. More details here.\nUNLOCKED!!: $85,000: I will create a Conjugations Expansion Deck so you can learn how to put verbs and adjectives into other tenses and forms like past, command, negative, likely, apparent, and others. This will train your brain to use more sophisticated Japanese. You might consider this an intermediate pack.\nUNLOCKED!!: $96,000: Unlocked the Daimy\u014d backer level with one Core Deck, all six Expansions, and a free Japanese: The Game Two-piece Card Box. It's 9'' long (28cm) so it will hold all the cards in the backer level along with a few more expansions as you continue to build your vocabulary.  The card box is also  available as an add-on; you just increase your pledge amount by $12 to get one.\nUNLOCKED!!: 2500 Backers: Everyone will get four more cards in the Core Deck AND all the $1 Backers get the First Edition Print-and-play instead of just the Beta. (They don't get a Print-and-Play of all the Expansions, but every level $10 and up does.)\nFINAL ROLLING STRETCH GOAL!!: I increased the deck by one card at $110,000 and will continue to add one card for every $2,000 we raise thereafter.\nI thank you all for your tremendous support! This has been a runaway success and I can't wait to deliver your cards and make more Japanese: The Game throughout 2014 and hopefully forever!\nThis game has a lot of expansion potential to help you learn the language and culture of Japan, so I'm going to keep going on this. Now that we've funded successfully, I'm going to fulfill this project and go on to make expansions for People, Numbers, Grade-level Kanji sets, The JPLT and BJT regulation langauage tests, and more!\nI'd love to hear from you, even if you don't back my project, about why you did or didn't, and I'll be contacting every one of you who backs me to thank you personally because this is something we're doing together.  It's a big undertaking, but I've already done most of the work and with your backing, we'll be able to make this a great game for anyone to study Japanese in groups in a way that's fun and engaging... so we can share the excitement of learning a new language and culture with everyone!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nChallenge: Creation logistics\nIt takes a lot of work hours to get new vocabulary turned into cards. With the Teacher and Professor contributor levels, fulfillment times are extended beyond the normal project for this reason. But even with the couple expansions we're making, a hundred or so new word cards will need to be created. Fortunately, I have written software that creates the cards after I populate a spreadsheet. I've already created about 60 cards this way, so the challenge is largely conquered.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #71", "update_userinfo": "Our Mascot Naming Contest is on!!

Hunt", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "WE FUNDED!!!  BUT...\nIf you missed the Kickstarter campaign, you can still help get to the next stretch goal (and get Obduction and more) at obductiongame.com! \n Ob`duc\u00b4tion, n.1. The act of drawing or laying over, as a covering. \nObduction is an all-new, real-time, first-person adventure that harkens back to the spirit of Cyan\u2019s earlier games Myst and Riven. Obduction resurrects that incredible feeling of suddenly finding yourself in the middle of a new world to explore, discover, solve, and become part of.\nThis year marks the 20th anniversary of the launch of Myst, one of the best-selling computer games in history. Myst was an exploration through a landscape of dramatically realistic images (rendered in Strata - check out the new Strata reward tier!) tied together to create an experience that was described as \u201cbecoming your world.\u201d The Myst name is widely recognized as uniquely defining a new kind of gaming - amazingly immersive worlds where the point is to understand your environment rather than test your reflexes. The Obduction project will take what Cyan knows about creating deeply immersive worlds and apply it to an entirely new game with fantastic scenery, incredible architecture, compelling story, and exceptional challenges.\nObduction will be built with the same framework that made Cyan's earlier games such a wonderful experience: stunning landscapes, deep storyline, engaging characters, dramatic soundscapes, and challenging yet intuitive puzzles. Obduction is an entirely new property, delivered using one of the most powerful game development technologies available today. Obduction is an adventure game for the new millennium that stays true to the concepts that made the genre great.\nAt the base funding level, Obduction will be developed for both Windows and MacOS, with a targeted release of mid-to-late 2015.\nThe game is being designed with a flexible scope in mind, so that as the budget grows, the game grows. More places; more puzzles; more mystery; more complexity; more adventure!\nWith the generalities out of the way, it's time to dig a bit deeper into specifics. If you know anything about Cyan's worlds, you know that you don't want to know too much ahead of time. We'll try our best to whet your appetite, without giving away too many spoilers.\nStory\nObduction's experience supplies what every good storyteller does: a very personal window into a much larger world. Obduction begins with... well\u2026 an abduction - your abduction. On a crystal clear, moon-lit night, a curious, organic artifact drops from the sky and inexplicably whisks you away across the universes to who-knows-where (or when, or why).\nAnd, as anyone who ever played Myst or Riven knows, exploring everything around you allows you to read between the lines and to begin to answer your questions. Why is there an old, abandoned farmhouse - complete with white picket fence - in the middle of an alien landscape? You'll find out. From this point on the story becomes your story. \nGame Design\nObduction has a few game design elements in common with Myst and Riven, and it skews into new areas as well. Cyan's basic design philosophy is simple:\nBuild every element of the experience to make you, the player, feel like this virtual world has become your world.\nThe interface should be intuitive and transparent.\nThe story should be revealed through exploration and not necessarily shoveled out in cinematic form.\nThe puzzles should range from easy to difficult, but even the toughest puzzles should be designed so that you know that all the pieces to solve it are there in front of you.\nThe sound and music should be balanced; they should add emotion but not become distracting or annoying.\nEnvironmental Immersion\nCyan has a proven history of delivering visually stunning environments that immerse players in our games. We plan to continue that tradition, leveraging Epic Games' Unreal Engine 4. Today's modern realtime engines have plenty of horse-power to produce zillions of bullets per second, but they can also be used to make remarkable landscapes and architecture that approach and even surpass the pre-rendered days of Riven. Unreal 4 is an amazing resource that enables us to build a world that you can lose yourself in.\nClick here for more info regarding the Unreal Engine 4...\nWe\u2019ve got add-ons. Three to be precise - add on a digital game, a boxed game, or a t-shirt. Here\u2019s how it works: Increase your pledge by the cost of the desired add-on(s) without changing your selected reward tier. After the end of the Kickstarter campaign, you\u2019ll receive a survey where you can confirm which add-on(s) you wanted. (Note that shipping is included in the amount of the add-on.)\nWe'll be excited to reach our target goal and make an amazing experience. But we're also anticipating what it means to move beyond that goal. Kickstarter funding over the base level would be used to make Obduction bigger and better - adding such stretch goals as new places to explore, additional platforms, localization, technological bells and whistles, and more.\nVery simple: It's what we love!\nWe love the wonder of having an entirely new world at our fingertips. We love the twisted unraveling of an unexpected storyline. We love the satisfying \"Aha! moment\" of solving a particularly perplexing puzzle. We love the rush of revelation when we find out what's around the next corner. We love the twinge of emotion entering a dimly lit room because we feel like this place has become our world.\nAnd we hear from more and more people who love all of those things, too. We'd love to make it for you!\nCyan has done it all. We started with self-publishing, hand-stuffing 3.5-inch floppies into boxes. We've done full-blown publisher models, where they get 88%. And we've even done all kinds of hybrid publishing models between the two. \nCurrently, we are independent, and it feels right. It's not the Myst heyday - money has come and gone, but we've managed to stay alive as a small, independent studio through times when indie studios were falling by the wayside. And now it seems that times have changed, and indie studios are making a comeback thanks to some interesting new publishing platforms and models - including Kickstarter.\n\nSimply put, Kickstarter is a way for us to deliver a stunning experience that doesn't empty your pocketbook, while keeping us independent enough to make choices that a publisher might not understand. (Like we did with Myst 20 years ago.)\n\nInstead of a detached, corporate marketing department guaranteeing to upper management how many units they will sell to justify a budget, we'll be relying on excited fans, family, friends, and even strangers who love what we're doing and want to be part of it. The funding and the budget become part of the development process instead of being coldly handed down from an accounting officer who doesn't even know the name of the product - let alone the names of any of the real people who will be making it.\nIn addition to regular Kickstarter updates, we will be making our development process transparent and accessible to our supporters in the form of exclusive backer forums. You'll be able to interact directly with the creators, read behind-the-scenes blog posts about the ins and outs of the game's development, and stay current with our overall progress. Don't worry, we'll do our best to keep the information spoiler-free, so that you still have a rich and surprising game to explore, even if you are an avid process junkie!\nThe funding will be spent solely on Obduction. It's very straightforward: we'll spend the funds that you invest on making Obduction the best possible experience.\nWe already have a team here - a few who've been here since the Myst days, and some who are more recent. We'll be adding to the team after we get funding, so we can flesh out our design and then get started on all the new art, modeling, texturing, sounds, music, lighting, characters, interface, technology, and more.\nWe don't want that team to be too large. One thing we've learned over the years is that it can be much more efficient and satisfying to have a smaller team that works closely together. We want everyone on the team to have ownership as we design and build this experience together. And we'll make sure you know who is on the team and how things are going. \nWe've done quite a few updates since we started. Here's a list that summarizes and links to a few of the more important updates. There's lots of information you don't want to miss!\n UPDATE 4: The \"Over $450,000, reddit AMA, Bonus Q&A\u201d Update\nWe answer a lot of questions in this Update.

Learn more!\nCyan was started in 1987 by brothers Rand and Robyn Miller. They released a new kind of children\u2019s software they called The Manhole. It was a simple, whimsical, black & white world to explore with very little to get in the way of the journey. It was well received by children of all ages. The brothers followed up with Cosmic Osmo and Spelunx - two more rich, non-threatening worlds for children to explore. \n\nIn 1991, Cyan began work on Myst, a project that would take everything they had learned about making worlds and use it to create a truly unique experience for an older, more sophisticated audience. Myst was about finding yourself lost in a world and simply exploring, understanding and becoming part of the story - and the public response was nothing short of phenomenal.

To get updates on the latest art find the goods via www.cqgames.com \n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n###\nThe first time we did metal gaming coins on Kickstarter they were universally lauded. Including at conventions around the world we've sold thousands of sets. Our Spanish doubloons are gorgeous, thematic and always draw a crowd. Check 'em out again:\nMmm...doubloons!\nYay doubloons!\nOK, so. How do we go from that great product to something better, something that moves away from the \"one-off\" accessory and becomes an affordable system you can use again and again? Before we give you the big picture, here's a little skin to get you excited:\nThe goddess Nike\nAnd see a set of our new \"Ancient Greek\"-era coins next to our super-deluxe doubloons:\nOur doubloons, next to modern U.S. currency, next to our Ancient Greek set\nThese are a real set of the coins we're making, already struck and produced, that will be the first set in our series. Notice that they are all:\n- Different sizes\n- Different metal finishes (electroplated)\n- Non-denominational\nThis allows them to be used for ANY game. It also allows them to mix-and-match with our easy-to-reach super-deluxe STRETCH GOALS...\nThis campaign is going to be dead simple:\n- If we hit our $5,000 goal, we'll make an entire 51 coin set of Greek coins\n- At $10,000, and again at every $10,000 thereafter ($20,000, $30,000, etc.), we'll make a new 50 coin set of a different theme that you can purchase\n- At $15,000, and at every $10,000 thereafter ($25,000, $35,000), we'll make the giant golden 51st coin for the set from the previous stretch goal, to be included for free each time someone buys one of that corresponding set\nEach set will fit ideally for a variety of games that have coins in their genre or timeframe. Our starter Greek set is perfect for a great Ancients game like Cyclades, or if you cheat a little something like Spartacus. Heck, you can really use them for any game: they are just beautiful art pieces! But they can also mix-and-match with the other sets we produce - depending on the success of this campaign.\nThe coolest thing? They can ALL mix together! If we end up doing 10 sets, each set will have up to five different sizes. Each different size is also the same colour. So, the smallest from each set can mix with the smallest from all the other sets. As such, for each denomination you have in your game you can have a bunch of different coins that all clearly represent that denomination. Not all of us will want to mix a bunch of different thematic coins to be used for the same game, but for those who do it is a unique opportunity to integrate beautiful works of tangible art into your games.\nSo finally, here's a look at all of these rockin' Greek coins!\nThe \"Aegina\" (quantity 20). Inspired by coined money from the isle of Aegina, the earliest Greek city-state to use coined money.\nThe \"Ephesos\" (quantity 15). The coin represents the goddess Artemis, patron of Ephesos where the legendary Temple of Artemis was built.\n\"Reflections\" (quantity 10). This brings together the iconic dolphins from the beautiful isle of Santorini with the two boys' opposing faces design that was common in the period, including in Thrace.\nThe \"Athena\" (quantity 5). A bust of the patron goddess of Athens, along with her iconic owl. This is the exemplar coin of antiquity.\nThe \"Alexander\" (quantity 1). This is a replica of his gold \"stater\", struck shortly after his death.\n###", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have run four successful Kickstarter campaigns thus far.

We've already run a set and thus can prove what we have in mind will work. We have a contract with a fine artist to produce all of the coins we are designing.\n\nCombining our past successes with the challenges we faced on our last campaign, we have both proven able to meet and exceed expectations, and bounce back from adversity.

As in its predecessor, players of VivaJava Dice take on the roles of employees at the VivaJava CoffeeCo., scouring the globe for the best beans to keep the company on top while keeping themselves one step ahead of the rest of the executives.\nAlso as in VivaJava, VivaJava Dice has players making the crucial decision between blending beans and research, but with a quick, new twist. Players must now use the dice in their pool to Blend \u2013 using the beans to create a best-seller for quick points, then deciding whether to press their luck in subsequent rounds for bigger points but fewer dice as the blends degrade \u2013 or to Research, which involves using their valuable beans to gain an ever-changing variety of dice-manipulating abilities, new ways to score, and paths that lead to aiding a competitor for a later payoff or hindering that competitor for immediate gratification. VivaJava Dice also offers a unique system of cooperative dice-rolling that can help you rise to the top, but at the price of someone else riding your coattails.\nWith an astounding mix of plug-and-play research abilities, subtle social play in semi-cooperative mode, and the chance to hog all the glory and blend the best for yourself, VivaJava Dice is all about choice, making each game decidedly and delightfully different.\n- Two Blend Coasters (Featured and Rainbow)\n- Flavor Coaster\n- Two Research Coasters (One double-sided Lite and House Blend, one custom Top Cup! Coaster)\n- Four Player Color/Reference Coasters\n- Two Solo coasters for solo play\n- One Intern coaster\n- 24 Research Discs (for use with the custom Top Cup! Research Coaster to randomize play and provide hundreds of variant set-ups)\n- 12 Wooden player discs\n- 10 Custom Coffee Dice\n- 5 Custom Flavor Dice\n- 1 Pad of Full-color Research Track/Score sheets, double-sided\n- 24 Research Ability reference cards\n- 4 Flavor cards for integrating VivaJava Dice with the original VivaJava\n- 1 Travel Jute tote that fits all components of VivaJava: The Coffee Game: The Dice Game for easy carrying to your favorite coffee house!\nWe built VivaJava Dice with a little help from our friends \u2014 the passionate and vibrant board game community! When TC first started developing VivaJava Dice, he prepared a print-and-play version for an open group of beta testers to try out. With their gracious help, new ideas were quickly tested and gameplay was improved. TC introduced a new print-and-play of the base game in late May and anyone who would like to try out VivaJava Dice is more than welcome. Check out the link and instructions here on Boardgamegeek.\nSince the birth of Dice Hate Me, fans of the blog, the company and really cool custom dice everywhere have been demanding their very own set of Angry Dice, but we've resisted the call to cubes until the right campaign came along. Well, the time is nigh - now you too can own the lovable, grumpy mascot of Dice Hate Me!\nAngry Dice are much more than just custom dice, though - these dice are a part of one of the fastest and most furious dice games ever created. \nOne fateful night at Origins Game Fair 2012, Shawn Purtell and Compounded designer Darrell Louder sat with the Dice Hate Me Games crew, waiting for a table at Barley's Brewing Company. Armed with only four dice and plenty of time to spare, the dynamic duo developed a truly addictive and adrenaline-fueled cube-tossing game for gamers of all ages. What has quickly become a favorite pursuit while passing time at the pub can now be shared with all of you. Want to see Angry Dice in action? Check out all the fun in The Showdown below!\nWhen we say that VivaJava Dice has a ton of variability, we aren't kidding - designer TC Petty III has so many ideas that his brain can barely contain them all. The \"Game of the Year\" Expansion was conceived as an expandable set of several themed expansions that could bring some of these new concepts and playstyles to VivaJava Dice. The first of these is the Anger Expansion. The core game is designed with positive player interaction and neutral conflict to provide a thoughtful and relaxing atmosphere for a large variety of gamers. The Anger Expansion does exactly the opposite - it's filled with a lot of sneaky moves, game-changing abilities and \"take that\" mechanics. It's a total blast to play, but it's not for the thin-skinned. The Anger Expansion also gives players a way to incorporate Angry Dice into their games of VivaJava Dice.\nThere are many other possible expansions we could introduce to the \"Game of the Year\" Expansion pledge level if funding is healthy and we reach certain stretch goals. We'll give you sneak peeks of others as the campaign rolls along!\nThe original VivaJava: The Coffee Game campaign ran on Kickstarter in January of 2012. We were blessed with an amazing amount of support for our second game, and since its release it has been embraced by gamers for its unique semi-cooperative play style and thoughtful social interaction for 3 to 8 players. Along with VivaJava, we also offered a separate \"Geekspansion\" to the game, which added more geek-inspired Blend Slates, Country Tokens and Investment Tokens. It has never been offered anywhere outside of conventions as promotional - but if you pledge for ALL THE CAFFEINE, you can get it here! Take a look at the original VivaJava campaign page for more information on the game and its Geekspansion.\nWe've achieved our base funding goal! That means we will be able to publish VivaJava Dice with the quality that we all have come to expect. Now that we have exceeded our base, that allows us to add more to the game! \nWe've exceeded $35,000 in pledges! That means we'll be able to incorporate a solo player mode into the base game \u2013 every pledge of COFFEE REGULAR and above will receive this stretch goal! For more information on the solo play Coaster, see Project Update #2.\nWe've reached $40K in pledge! That means we'll be upgrading the \"Game of the Year\" Expansion at the COFFEE DELUXE pledge levels and above. The GOTY Expansion will receive Coasters and Research Discs themed around Dice Hate Me Games titles like Carnival, Compounded and the upcoming Brew Crafters. These will be very thematic and fun variants that will add even more replayability to your games of VivaJava Dice! For more information on the DHMG Expansion, see Project Update #2.\nWe've reached $45,000 in pledges! We can now include two new upgrades to the base game of VivaJava: The Coffee Game: The Dice Game. The first upgrade is the addition of the Intern Research Disc and Coaster. This coaster is built around our concept of \"inception\" technology, allowing players to go one level deeper. When a player Researches this ability track, they place a token on one of the Intern Abilities on the Intern Coaster. Hiring an Intern opens up a large variety of dice manipulation abilities, allowing players to customize their play strategy even more!\nThe second upgrade is a set of 28 mini-sized cards - the same size and style as the Flavor cards in the original VivaJava. Twenty four of these cards are references for the 24 different Ability Discs in the base game, allowing players an easy way to keep track of abilities every time they mix up the game. Four of the cards can be placed into the Flavor Deck in VivaJava: The Coffee Game, allowing VivaJava Dice to be played with the original!\nWe've reached $50,000 in pledges, so we'll be upgrading ANGRY DICE! That's right, we have a few upgrades planned for the Angry Dice system, the first being integration of the Wild Die, originally introduced in our first Kickstarter campaign for Carnival, and the Lucky Bean die, an homage to one of our favorite blends from the original VivaJava. For more information on this awesome stretch reward, see Project Update #2 and Project Update #6.\nWe've reached $55,000 in pledges, so we'll do a double upgrade! The base game - any pledge of COFFEE REGULAR and above - will receive both a Brewple-shaped eraser, as well as a thicker score pad with more sheets! We know there's been a lot of discussion about the paper score pads, and it's always been our wish to include a little something special for gaming old school with pencils. Not only can you use the Brewple to adjust scores and Research tracks, you can also use it to designate the game's Brewmaster - the start player that comes into play with a couple of advanced variants.\nThe other aspect of the $55K stretch goal will be the remainder of the Angry Dice expansion dice. The other two dice are homages to The Great Heartland Hauling Co. and Compounded. For more information on the rules for these expansion dice, please see update #8.\nThanks to everyone for helping us reach these goals! \n\"There is real, crunchy strategy involved here in what you choose to do with your roll. Well-thought-out player interaction. Scales well from 1-4 players. And the modular set-up causes replayability to be off the charts. A very interesting, quick-playing yet thought-provoking game that I hope some will not dismiss as another too-light dice-rolling filler.\" - Jim N., Boardgamegeek.com\n\"I've been searching for a great end-of-the-night game and this is the one! Rolling fistfuls of pretty dice to make coffee blends, invest in research, and ultimately get 21 points works for me!

This is a game my wife not only asks to play regularly (she refuses to call it anything but \u201cDiced Coffee\u201d), but wants to play back to back multiple times in one sitting. So, I personally have to say the designer has succeeded in his mission.\" - Ryan Sanders, boardgamegeek.com\n\"Angry Dice plays fast and if games like Coup or Love Letter are microgames then Angry Dice is a nano game. It plays in a matter of minutes but is a solid rush and more fulfilling than any micro game I\u2019ve ever tried.\" - Scott King, writer. photographer. educator.\n\"SO much better than Love Letter.\" - Ben Pinchback, co-designer of Fleet, talking about Angry Dice.\n\"I am nobody of consequence, and that is fantastic.\" - Matt Riddle, co-designer of Fleet, talking about Angry Dice.\nKickstarter provides a platform for direct consumers to get VivaJava: The Coffee Game: The Dice Game shipped directly to their door before it hits the store shelves. As a retailer, though, you may reserve copies of the game through Game Salute.\nWithout our Kickstarter Backers, Dice Hate Me Games would not be able to bring quality games to market. To show our respect and appreciation, DHMG promises that backer copies of VivaJava Dice will be shipped out before copies are available for purchase at retailers or conventions. DHMG also pledges to keep all backers informed at every step in the development, printing and delivery processes.

It has been an amazing couple of years for the company, and we are all grateful for the outstanding support of our extended Kickstarter family that have made possible four great projects - Carnival, VivaJava, The Great Heartland Hauling Co., and Compounded.\nThis time around it's TC Petty III's turn to be in the spotlight - again! You all may remember TC from his memorable VivaJava: The Coffee Game campaign video last year; he loves to make an impression. But any of you out there who have met TC over the past couple of years already know that he is nothing like his video alter ego - he is a warm, gracious and humble designer with grand ideas and an amazing passion for board games. He just happens to love poking fun at his own coffee snobbery, and we're lucky enough to catch it all on camera. ;)\nWhen I first played VivaJava: The Coffee Game in 2011, I instantly fell in love. The same thing holds true when TC unveiled VivaJava Dice in January of this year - I was blown away, and I think you all will be, too. The game is fun, unique, and incredibly addictive. Thanks in advance for all your support - now get in here and get caffeinated... again!\nAll the best,\nChris Kirkman", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs with any project that involves the production and manufacture of a good to be delivered, there is certainly a real chance for hiccups, delays and more than one or two gremlins gumming up the works along the way. Many boardgame projects on Kickstarter have been seriously hampered by art production delays, problems with an overseas factory, missing units and one shipping snafu after another. This has never been more true than when dealing with custom dice - gremlins just love custom dice. They're delicious. True story.\n\nLuckily, we have a few projects under our belt, and have dealt with many of those snafus and gremlins along the way. We have a good working relationship with two of our overseas manufacturers and have become accustomed to their protocols, communication styles and general idiosyncrasies. We try to plan for all contingencies, and we've been fairly successful with that in our past projects. We've also been lucky enough to have an inside track with many other project creators and publishers who have produced a custom dice game in the past and so we know quite a few helpful tricks.\n\nWe won't lie - stuff happens. Delays can occur. Sometimes you have to go back and forth on color samples six times just to get the color right, and even then the color isn't perfect.

Something that will knock everyone\u2019s proverbial socks off.\nIn our research of Indian past times and cultures for another game in the works we came across some references to Ganjifa cards. Thinking the concept sounded pretty cool, we started looking for a place to purchase some of these cards and rules to play them with.\nOur Prototype Deck\nGanjifa cards have been around for centuries in India and Persia, but they are relatively new to the West. Ganjifa cards are round playing cards, numbered 1-10 with two face cards: the Raja (King) and the Vizier (Minister). There are 8 suits in the Mughal version which makes 96 cards in all. \nGanjifa cards are traditionally hand painted and the rules for games are passed down from one generation to the next. The sad part about Ganjifa is that it seems to be a dying art. There are fewer and fewer artists in India producing the cards and few in the West are even aware of Ganjifa. This is where we stepped in.\nThe Plan\nWhile we found bits and fragments of rules around the internet, we could only find individual hand painted cards for sale, and the cost was quite high. To breathe new life into this art form, and to make it available to everyone, we decided to print our own cards. We also compiled the rules we found to make the games complete. Instead of just making a few sets for ourselves, we thought it would be great to share Ganjifa with the rest of the world. Hence the kickstarter. \nAll of our cards are round with a 2.9 inch diameter and printed on UV coated card stock  Our face cards will be lavishly illustrated with all designs based on historic decks from the 16th century. \nAn example of the artwork that our artist has done for us in the past.\nThe Opportunity\nThis is a great opportunity to get an unusual and rare set of cards that is the first general printing in the US since the 1950s. Ganjifa cards are a must have for any serious playing card collector, Indian or Persian history enthusiast, those wanting a cultural tie to India, or those interested in Indian mysticism.\nIf you would like additional decks with your reward, just add $14 each ($15 if shipping internationally to a maximum of 6 decks total).\nNote: The cards shown in the video and other images were made as a prototype using open source artwork.  We will be commissioning unique, historically based artwork for all of our cards.\nWe will be Kicking it Forward!  http://kickingitforward.org", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAlthough there are always risks involved in a project of this kind, we believe that the risks are minimal in this case.\n\nThe artist we will be using is one we have used in the past and not only do they do great work but they are very reliable. \n\nAs to card printing, although we have not had large numbers of cards printed before, the company we are choosing is very reputable and is highly reviewed.\n\nAt Tab Creations, we will do our best to make sure all of our backers are satisfied and will make sure to keep everyone up to date on all aspects of the project as it moves along.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #14", "update_userinfo": "Latest From Tab Creations: Siren's Call Kickstarter!", "update_content": "It\u2019s been a while since the Ganjifa Kickstarter.

See the FAQ section below\nHelp Indie Boards and Cards make the reprint of Snowdonia even better than before!\nWe are very excited to announce a collaborative effort with Tony Boydell and Surprised Stare games to make this fantastic worker placement game more readily available for everyone to enjoy - and this isn't just a reprint, the 2nd edition of Snowdonia will feature highly detailed railworker miniatures.\nThe 2nd Edition includes 20 figures in total - 4 each in 5 player colors\nTony and Alan of Surprised Stare Games have also been working on a double expansion that gives even more options for your gaming enjoyment.  This kickstarter will help bring Snowdonia back, and hep us release this exciting new expansion.\nSnowdonia is the most expensive game that Indie Boards and Cards has ever made -  and will have a $70 MSRP. I truly appreciate the support that kickstarter backers have provided over the last several years, and I really need your support to make this project come to life - that is why I am offer this great game at a substantially discounted price and including a number of upgrades and promos not linked to stretch goals!\nSnowdonia\nThe peaks of Snowdonia rise before you, encased in mist, their summits barely visible. The highest is Snowdon (Wyddfa) herself at 1,085 metres. The year is 1894, and the Snowdon Mountain Tramroad and Hotels Company Limited has been formed to build a branch line from Llanberis to the summit. You can scarcely believe it's possible!\nIn Snowdonia players represent work gangs providing labour for the construction of the Snowdon Mountain Railway. Unlike other train games you will have to excavate your way up a mountain side, as well as make and lay the track, construct viaducts and stations. All this in competition with the weather of the Welsh mountains (and the game itself)!\nYou may be assisted by a train (though that's not always best) and you'll be able to collect essential materials from the Stock Yard. You will obtain special work contracts that give you bonuses.\nCan you contribute more than the other players to the magnificence of the Snowdon Mountain Railway?\nSnowdonia is a very fast playing worker placement game - my personal favorite in the genre, that is why I approached Tony & team to help publish the 2nd edition of the game.  Easily playable in under an hour, and with options for solo play - Snowdonia packs a lot of punch into a short play time with no downtime.  The event tracks & weather mechanics are quite innovative, and they both force you to keep on your toes and ensures a high degree of replay value (before you even consider the mini-expansion (Ffestiniog) included in the base game and the Jungfrau/Mt. Washington expansions that are also available in this project).  In sum I love this strategic & surprisingly thematic worker placement game and really want to see it get the attention that it deserves!\nHere is Tony explaining the game prior to its initial release:\nI am not the only one that has enjoyed this game, here are a number of written & video reviews from the 1st edition of this game:\nRahdo Runs Through - Video Review Link\nJoel Eddy (Eekamouse) - Video Review Link\nLittle Metal Dog Show - Written Review Link\nC.J. Robinson - Written Review Link\nMt. Washington/Jungfrau Expansion\nAt the same time we are releasing the 2nd Edition of Snowdonia, we are also introducing an Expansion consisting of two new scenarios for advanced players.\nYou've forged your way up Mount Snowdon and built the Ffestiniog Railway - now try out two new peaks! Use excessive dynamite to blast your way through the Eiger, up to the Jungfraujoch (the highest railway station in the world) and on to the Sphinx Observatory. Or climb Mount Washington by building the Cog Railway from Marshfield Station to the Summit. On both these routes snow will be a new hazard, forcing the labourers to dig out track and station sites after snowstorms, but both offer interesting and challenging new mechanisms for the railway building teams. There are new trains, including the Snowplow, Foundry Loco and Old Peppersass, the first locomotive made for the Mount Washington Cog Railway, which gives you a discount on hauling stone up the mountain.\nExclusive Promo - Pont Britannia\nThis scenario is played by the core game rules, and comprises of 7 stations: Bangor, Llanfair PG (a non-promo version of the long name station), Gaerwen, Bodorgan, Ty Croes, Valley and Holyhead (all but Bangor are on Anglesey);\n- the Britannia Bridge (between Bangor and Llanfair PG) \u2013 a  track card that, when completed, flips to become a sort-of-station card that can then be built as normal;\n- steel bar requirements in stations that count towards Contract Card track bonuses instead of straight points(!);\n- a trio of tweaked Contract cards (no Surveyor BONUSES in this scenario)*\n- a new train that allows the owner to build track instead of the game (if they want) whenever the game would build track through an Event\nExclusive promos are items that are even more limited than our standard promos, and will only be available through Indie Boards and Cards (at events like Essen for example) or our direct representatives. We aren't limiting any of these promos to kickstarter, but it's still not going to be easy to get the exclusives outside of kickstarter.\nPromos\nAll reward packages will include two new promo cards - Ivor the Engine, and the lost Engine No1 - Ladas. \nDraft images & layout\n2nd Edition Cloth bags at the $25 Pledge Level\nThe first edition of Snowdonia had a cloth bag to draw cubes from that was a bit lacking.  Unless your young kids were there to help, you really couldn't draw cubes from it very well.  The 2nd Edition of the game corrects this problem, and now that 2nd Edition bag is included in all the $25 pledge reward levels.  Here the 1st edition bag is shown on the left, and the 2nd edition is shown on the right:\nWhy Kickstarter?\nThree reasons really. First \u2013 while sales of the first edition of Snowdonia were good, and I am very optimistic about the 2nd edition of the game and the expansion - this is the most expensive project that Indie Boards and Cards has ever attempted and its the \"heaviest\" game that we have done.  This is new territory for us!\n\nSecondly, as in all of our projects cashflow is a major concern, doubly so with such an expensive game. The time between when I pay for games (now) and when I get paid for them is upwards of 7 months, and that is in the best of circumstances. That takes a lot of money sitting in inventory, and that isn\u2019t something that we have a lot of right now.\nThirdly, I really wanted to get the miniatures included in this game.  I have seen the pictures of those that paid big money to replace the wooden pawns with period correct railroad workers, and I knew that a lot of people would really like to have these included.  These four miniatures take two molds to make, a significant upfront cost!\nWhat are Kickstarter Funds used for?\nYour pledge dollars go directly into making the pledge rewards, and shipping them to you.  We have invested in getting the project to this point where its ready, your support ensures that we have the cash to pay our printers to make the games - the most costly part of game production. \nHow to I get the system to charge the shipping to Canada?\nKickstarter only lets you list one international shipping charge, soto trick the system for Canadian shipping - please select \"Ship to the US\" (this is a manual process) and then add the extra $ to your pledge as follows:\n$15 & $25  Pledge Levels - $5 extra (Pledge $20 or $30 respectively for these reward levels)\n$50 & $60 Pledge Levels - $15 Extra (pledge $65 or $75 respecitvely   for these reward levels)\nInternational Shipping - Outside of Canada - Kickstarter should Charge this automatically\n$15 Pledge Level - $9 extra (Pledge $24 for this reward level)\n$25 Pledge Level - $9 extra (Pledge $34 for this reward level)\n$50 Pledge Level - $20 extra (Pledge $70 for this reward level)\n$60 Pledge Level - $20 extra (Pledge $80 for this reward level)\nBuild your own level\nMix and match any of the above pledge levels to determine the pledge amount.  No matter how much you pledge, shipping stays the same - add $40 to Canada or $60 everywhere else internationally.\nPledge $15 for each expansion, $25 for the each set of Expansion & Miniatures, $50 for each copy of Snowdonia or $60 for each set of Snowdonia & Expansion - total all that and add the fixed shipping amount to determine your pledge total.  Your total before shipping needs to $240 or greater .Ask if you need help determining the right pledge amount.\nAbout Indie Boards and Cards\nIndie Boards and Cards started in 2009 as an independent publisher of great game designs. In 2010 we released three games, all of which have been well received by critics and fans alike. Our biggest seller has been The Resistance - a game of secret identities, deception and deduction that is now or will soon be available in 20 languages around the world. In 2011 we released Flash point: Fire Rescue, which has also been very well received and now available (or soon to be) in 10 different languages.  In 2012 we released the humorous game of certain death - Gauntlet of Fools.   Be sure to look for The Resistance, Flash Point: Fire Rescue, and Gauntlet of Fools wherever games are sold. If your favorite game store doesn\u2019t carry our games, please ask them to!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIndie Boards and Cards has successfully delivered a number of previous kickstarter projects to thousands of supporters. We expect that our previous experiences will enable us to also deliver this project on time. That said there are always complexities and considerations in a project of this scope that may cause delays. Indie Boards and Cards will use contract manufacturing to make this game, freight forwarders to get games through customs and 3rd parties like the US Post Office and FEDEX to ship the games to you - we don't control everything and there are lots of opportunity for delay. other conditions may also cause delays - earthquakes, alien invasions, asteroid attacks, zombie plague are but a few of the myriad of reasons we may not be able to deliver this project in a timely manner.\n\nAnother challenge is that production of Snowdonia will be done while production of my other projects are also being completed (Coup & Flash Point: Extreme Danger). While this does present some possibilities for risk, that risk is measurable and mitigated by my choice of production partners. Without disclosing proprietary details, my production partner is a world leader and manufacturer for many of the top board game brands in the both the hobby and the mass market.\n\nMy pledge is that I will deliver what I said and have written this project page as concisely and clearly as I can.

Exclusive promos are items that are even more limited than our standard promos, and will only be available through Indie Boards and Cards (at events like Essen for example) or our direct representatives. We aren't limiting any of these promos to kickstarter, but its till not going to be easy to get the exclusives outside of kickstarter.\nWe want to include your ideas into this project and future Flash Point expansions - so please post your favorites and provide feedback on what others have posted in the comments section.  Its not me that you have to convince, its the 1,600+ other backers that need to support your idea and promote it to the top.  Its how the \"Rescue Dog\", the \"Veteran\" and Locked Doors got added to the list!\n2nd Story & Urban Structures\nThrough this kickstarter we also intend to re-release the two previous Flash point: Fire Rescue expansions, 2nd Story and Urban Structures.  Both of these expansions are currently sold out at the publisher level and your support helps ensure that we can bring them back into print without losing our shirts.  Keeping expansions in print is a challenge, and kickstarter is a great way for us to keep these available for everyone that may want to pick them up but missed the first printings.\n2nd Story includes two new buildings to use with Flash Point: Fire Rescue. Each building is on two boards, each board representing one floor of the building. The boards are double sided and mounted.  Also included is a token sheet with Ladders, Windows, an explosion marker, extra Doors & POI placement tokens that are added to use in the 2nd Story expansion.\nUrban Structures contains a double sided, mounted game board, each side is a different building - The High Rise and The Brownstone.  This expansion also includes the Structural Engineer specialist card, and additional map specific rules with variants and scenarios for both the expansion and the base game.\nWhy Kickstarter?\nThree reasons really. First \u2013 while sales of Flash Point to date have been strong and I am very optimistic that they will continue to get even stronger, there just aren\u2019t enough copies out in the market to make printing an expansion economically viable without direct support from kickstarter. The game just isn\u2019t popular enough to print in the minimum required print runs and sell them via distribution.  I know there are enough people that really want these expansions and through kickstarter I can reach them directly to make this at least break even.\n\nSecondly, it is all about cashflow. The time between when I pay for games (now) and when I get paid for them is upwards of 7 months, and that is in the best of circumstances. That takes a lot of money sitting in inventory, and that isn\u2019t something that we have a lot of right now.\nThirdly, I really wanted to be able to get a lot of little extras made for the biggest fans of the game.  I love all the creative little ideas that people send to me, and want to get some of those out to people to enjoy. Kickstarter really is a great platform to do that through.\nWhat are Kickstarter Funds used for?\nYour pledge dollars go directly into making the pledge rewards, and shipping them to you.  We have invested in getting the project to this point where its ready, your support ensures that we have the cash to pay our printers to make the games - the most costly part of game production. \nWhat are the shipping costs to Canada?\nKickstarter only lets you list one international shipping charge, so if you are getting your rewards sent to Canada - please select \"Ship to the US\" (this is a manual process) and then add the extra $ to your pledge as follows:\n$32 or $40 Pledge Levels - $10 extra (Pledge $42 or $50 respectively for these reward levels)\n$55 Pledge Level - $15 Extra (pledge $70 for this reward level)\n$65 Pledge Level - $20 Extra (pledge $85 for this reward level))\n$65 Pledge Level - $20 Extra (pledge $85 for this reward level))\n$100 Pledge Level - $30 Extra (Pledge $130 for this reward level)\n$110 Pledge Level - $30 Extra (Pledge $140 for this reward level)\n$150 Pledge Level - $35 Extra (Pledge $185 for this reward level)\n$175 Pledge Level - $40 Extra (Pledge $215 for this reward level)\n$250 Pledge Level - $50 Extra (Pledge $300 for this reward level)\nMix & Match level - This lets you mix and match any reward tier for fixed max of $50 extra in postage to Canada, or $75 to other international destinations.  Add together the pledge levels, and then postage to determine the pledge costs.  For example getting two everything packages ($100), and 6 copies of Extreme Danger with promos ($40) sent to Canada is $550 (2x$100 + 6x$40 + $50).\nAbout Indie Boards and Cards\nIndie Boards and Cards started in 2009 as an independent publisher of great game designs. In 2010 we released three games, all of which have been well received by critics and fans alike. Our biggest seller has been The Resistance - a game of secret identities, deception and deduction that is now or will soon be available in 20 languages around the world. In 2011 we released Flash point: Fire Rescue, which has also been very well received and now available (or soon to be) in 10 different languages.  In 2012 we released the humorous game of certain death - Gauntlet of Fools.   Be sure to look for The Resistance, Flash Point: Rescue, and Gauntlet of Fools wherever games are sold. If your favorite game store doesn\u2019t carry our games, please ask them to!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIndie Boards and Cards has successfully delivered a number of previous kickstarter projects to thousands of supporters. We expect that our previous experiences will enable us to also deliver this project on time. That said there are always complexities and considerations in a project of this scope that may cause delays. Indie Boards and Cards will use contract manufacturing to make this game, freight forwarders to get games through customs and 3rd parties like the US Post Office and FEDEX to ship the games to you - we don't control everything and there are lots of opportunity for delay. other conditions may also cause delays - earthquakes, alien invasions, asteroid attacks, zombie plague are but a few of the myriad of reasons we may not be able to deliver this project in a timely manner.\n\nMy pledge is that I will deliver what I said and have written this project page as concisely and clearly as I can. So please read everything on this page - every kickstarter project is unique, and the commitments I am making to you regarding this project are completely defined here.\n\nA particular challenge to a project like this is negativity - I love your input, and really enjoy all the great suggestions that come from the large majority of our supporters. I promise that if you keep your comments positive and proactive that the project will get more in the way of stretch goals and get your rewards to you sooner. I can't include all the suggestions that I get, nor can I give you specific feedback other than noting that I do read all the comments and messages sent to me. So think before you post - threats, ultimatums and entitlement are unlikely to get you what you are asking for, and very likely that everyone else (myself included) will get less. Have an issue? Send me a note - and please don't support us if you aren't satisfied with what the project is returning to you. Nothing would make me happier than having 100% of my supporters be 100% satisfied with their pledge rewards!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #48", "update_userinfo": "Flash Point Tragic Events - Final hours", "update_content": "The end is near!

If you are a backer - watch for updates to get notified right away when new projects start and get in early for special rewards.\n2nd Story \u2013 a new expansion for Flash Point: Fire Rescue\n2nd Story was created by Lutz Pietschker, one of Flash Point: Fire Rescue\u2019s biggest fans. Lutz is a firefighter in Germany, and helped support Flash Point at Essen 2012. His creation is first of what I hope to be many fan created expansions that Indie Boards and Cards release.\n2nd Story includes two new buildings to use with Flash Point: Fire Rescue. Each building is on two boards, each board representing one floor of the building. The boards are double sided, and mounted and will fit into your Flash Point box.\nAlso included is a token sheet with Ladders, Windows, an explosion marker, extra Doors & POI placement tokens that are added to use in the 2nd Story expansion. Ladders and Stairs provide access to the upper building level, and Windows are a great way of getting in and out of the building without causing structural damage. Combined these making exciting new strategic and tactical choices for firefighters!\nFinally, all the supporters of this expansion will get a set of the new firefighter figures. These oversized miniatures will replace the game\u2019s wooden pawns in the 2nd Edition of Flash Point and help make the game a much more thematic experience. I am really excited to be able to get these figures included in this project, and hope that you\u2019ll be even more excited to play the game with your friends and family once you get them.\n2nd edition - Firefighters, bonus for all supporters\nUrban Structures \u2013 re-release the 1st expansion for Flash Point: Fire Rescue\nUrban Structures was done as a limited release for our kickstarter project last year, and included two new buildings, a new firefighter specialist and some variant rules/scenarios for Flash Point. Feedback has been great, and through kickstarter we hope to be able to release this (and the rescue meeples) again.\nSo if you are so excited about these expansions, why do you need funding to get it made? \n\nThree reasons really. First \u2013 while sales of Flash Point to date have been strong and I am very optimistic that they will continue to get even stronger for the rest of 2012, there just aren\u2019t enough copies out in the market to make printing an expansion economically viable without direct support from kickstarter. The game just isn\u2019t popular enough (yet!) to print 3,000 more copies of Urban Structures or 3,000 copies of 2nd Story and sell them via distribution without losing a lot of money. That said I know there are enough people that really want these expansions if I can reach them directly to make this at least break even, and that is what kickstarter is all about.\n\nSecondly, it is all about what we call cashflow. The time between when I pay for games (now) and when I get paid for them is upwards of 7 months, and that is in the best of circumstances. That takes a lot of money sitting in inventory, and that isn\u2019t something that we have a lot of right now.\nThirdly, I really wanted to be able to get these cool firefighter figures into your hands as quickly as possible. Kickstarter really is a great platform to do that through.\nSo I hope that you support this project and help bring these expansions to market.\nDetails on Pledge Levels \u2013 Early Bird Specials, Rush Delivery & International Delivery.\n\nFor as long as I have them I will send out copies of the firefighter figures, Urban Structures and rescue meeples right away. That means as soon as you are charged you get these sent to you right away. The sooner you pledge your support the more more likely you will be getting these early bird specials because I will go in order of pledge time.\nNote \u2013 Many of the Early Bird specials are limited to US supporters, unfortunately international postage costs are high and out of my control. I appreciate international supporters but can\u2019t control postage rates. Thanks for understanding.\n\nEssen Pick Up - Due to many complications of years past I will not be taking pre-paid Essen orders this year. Sign up at this level and I\u2019ll reserve a copy of 2nd Story, Urban Structures, Flash Point, and the firefighter figures for Thursday pick up at Essen. Kickstarter will send a survey at the end and will ask you how many you would like to reserve. Essen prices will be similar in Euros at the event. If you are picking up at Essen, do not pledge at one of the other levels.\n\n$15 - 2nd Story \u2013 you\u2019ll get the 2nd Story expansion and the firefighter figures at this pledge level. \n\n\u2022 Early Bird Special #1 (Closed): As long as I have stock of the firefighters I will send them out right after this project funds to people in the US.

Canadian & International supporters \u2013 if you want the firefighters sent early please add $5 to your order, otherwise I will wait and send the entire order together.

You must face your fears, never give up, and above all else work as a team because the fire is raging, the building is threatening to collapse and people are in danger.\nYou must succeed \u2013 lives are on the line!\n\nFlashPoint: Fire Rescue is a cooperative game that is fun to play with friends and family. All the players are on the same team - everyone either wins or loses together. With four levels of play (Family, Recruit, Veteran and Heroic) there is a challenge appropriate for players of all skills and ages. The game was released on Kickstarter just over a year ago. For a very brief time it was the largest board game project on the site \u2013 but now several games have raised more than 10 times what Flash Point did.\nWe are very excited about all the support we have had from the people that supported that first project, and those that played the game since. We are also very excited about all the support we have from hobby market retailers around the world, and this year really excited that Flash Point will be stocked in select Barnes & Noble and Target stores. As the market for hobby games expands it is really exciting to have a game that has captured so many people\u2019s imaginations and we hope that the 2nd edition of the game and the two expansions featured in this project will help make Flash Point a modern classic enjoyed by families around the world.\nAbout Indie Boards and Cards\n\nIndie Boards and Cards started in 2009 as an independent publisher of great game designs.

She will be contacted by our artist Jules to pick her colors!  She won a custom 2- or 3- color lanyard from Knitted Steel!    \n The Earth is probably doomed, and rumors and speculation run rampant. Newspaper headlines from across the globe stir the populace to desperation: \n\"MELTING POLAR ICE CAPS\" \"RISING SEA LEVELS\" \"POLLUTION!\" \"OVERPOPULATION!\" \"NUCLEAR WINTER?\" \"RAVENOUS BLACK STAR GOATS?\" \"WILL METEORS STRIKE YOUR CHILDREN?\" \"DISASTER LOOMS!\"\nThe race to escape Earth has begun! With the world's nations in decline, powerful corporations now stand as humanity's last hope. Take the reins of one such corporation, as CEO, and venture out into space. With your mission in hand; build ships, collect resources, research technologies, survive the dangers of space exploration, and, while ticket sales hold steady, preserve the human race. Remember to stay a step ahead of competing corporations, which can use slick marketing campaigns and 10 cent tchotchkes to buy the loyalty of the people you just saved from certain doom! \nhttp://www.facebook.com/BreakFromReality\n5/31 thru 6/3 - Origins Game Fair - Columbus, OH - Open Demo!  Booth 853\n6/7 - Private Event - on campus of Microsoft! - Seattle, WA (Gamers Club)\n6/10 - The Dreaming Comics and Games - Seattle, WA 12-5 PM - Open Demo!\nPlayers are rewarded points for building colonies and saving colonists. As a CEO you are also rewarded points for filling the Corporate treasury, and building the company's value proposition by retaining rights to the best technologies. Game play is fast and engaging. As you explore space, unforeseen hazards will keep you on your toes, while special events will keep your underlings busy with paperwork for decades to come! The Galaxy Map is tile-based, and constructed as you explore. This makes each game unique and provides excellent replay value.\nHere we are playing the first phase of the game at high speed:\nCheck out our video preview with Tom Vasel of The Dice Tower:\n57 Exploration Tiles\n55 Technology Cards\n90 Customer Tokens\n100 Resource Tokens (60x 1, 20x 5, 20x 10)\n48 Corporation tokens (12 of each color- Red, Yellow, Blue, Black)\n16 Space Ships (4 colors, 4 unique sculpts) (prototype ships pictured)\n6 Warp Gate Tokens\n6 Warp Gate Token Stands\n4 Orbital Platform Tokens\n1 Earth Starting Tile\n1 First Player Token\n4 Player Dashboards (prototype art pictured)\nWhile the prototype shown does not contain all of the final art, consider it representative of the box contents.  The Dashboards will be fully re-designed in the coming weeks, and we will post art once complete!\n\nAdd this set of 12 Exploration tiles (now 18!) to your copy of Disaster Looms! These additional tiles can be used to add a bit more game length, or to add additional replay value, length, or mystery to the treasures - and dangers - that space has to offer. These 18 tiles will add 2 additional events and four more region tiles per game phase.\n\nThese are the 4 different sculpts we have produced for the 15 prototype games we produced of Disaster Looms! Embrace the retro styling.  These will NOT be what is included with the game.\n\nRather than choosing generic game pieces for Disaster Looms! we made our own. Three of the four final designs are complete #1 and #2 and shown above, as painted by our friend Zack Smith (back at $100 to get a set painted by him!  More of his work: http://daybydayminis.blogspot.com/). Hand-sculpted and cast in resin, these little  beauties are a work of art that can be used in other games as well.

Ricochet Rock Jockeys is an extremely fast-paced 2-6 player party game where players take on the role of the Unmanned Trading Probes making deliveries to the colonies of Earth - at any cost. We hope to have this available by the end of June.\nEvery copy of the game will include also include a copy of the Ricochet Rock Jockeys minigame. (Rules and art previews coming soon)  Hooray!  Asteroid mining!\nEvery copy of the game comes with our 5 & 6 player expansion - The Captains of Corporations!  This expansion includes: two additional player sets, new technologies, 21 new exploration tiles, and a set of CEOs and Corporations with unique advantages, disadvantages, and goals of their own. This is a full expansion for the game, and provides more than enough for the additional players - while also allowing greater flexibility and randomness in game play at smaller sizes as well.\nYou have unlocked early access to a Print & Play version of the next game set in the Disaster Looms! universe: Damage Report, designed by Alex Barbieri. Damage Report is a modular 2-8 player simultaneous, real-time cooperative game where you and your friends take on the roles of a starship crew faced with making constant repairs to your damaged ship in the midst of a catastrophe. Unlike many cooperative games, the simultaneous, real-time nature of the game helps prevent groupthink. This forces players to make decisions with minimal feedback and prevents one player from simply running the show.\nDamage Report is due up on Kickstarter in August, and takes 30-45 minutes to play, with more time given to fewer players. The Print & Play version will come with the first scenario: Save the Meteora, and will allow you to play more scenarios as they become available for testing.\nXENO-POLITICS: All backers at the $50 level and above will receive a copy of the Disaster Looms!

The art looks fantastic! Most importantly - they work and perform exactly as we had expected them to. We had 5 samples show up in time for Origins. These samples had correct art, correct texture, beautiful color penetration, but not to full size yet. These mats were 22\" x 14\". The mats performed for literally hundreds of people playing both Disaster Looms! and Damage Report. The tiles did not scoot around, and the modules stead steadily in place the entire weekend. It was amazing. See the picture below of the set up of the mats for both games. This just leaves the question: When do we get our awesome mats? The short answer is \"not yet\". The long answer is that we are working with the manufacturer to scale up the printing machine to do the size of print that we need. This is a completely new print process, with a patented non-slip additive to the actual print process. This is not something that will wear off, or stop working (unless the mat gets really dusty or dirty - then wipe off and voila - good as new!). This week I am supposed to have a discussion with the manufacturer to get guidance on lead time for when this machine can be ready to produce a wide format mat using this process. I have been told that we should have the mats very soon. We finally are seeing the light... we think it was worth the wait, we hope you do as well once you have your mat."}, {"status": []}], "comment_no": 367, "projec_url": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/bfrgames/disaster-looms", "project_name": "Disaster Looms!"}}, {"backer": "Walter H. Hunt", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "What is Scanbox?\nScanbox is an easy to use, affordable and unbelievably portable scanning box that uses your smartphone's camera to take amazing high quality scans. It's easy to set up and packs down flat to easily fit into your bag or brief case. \nScanbox was born from the idea that we need to use document scanners every so often, but traditional desktop scanners are far too big, expensive and cumbersome for their occasional usefulness. They take up desk space, require you to install drivers/updates and need a power source to operate. Scanbox on the other hand can be set up and packed down in seconds.\nWe [Phil Bosua, Ben Hillier and Luke Allen] have redesigned Scanbox countless times over the past 3 months; constantly making it simpler to use and ensuring it works in every situation. We are now ready to take Scanbox into full production. Thats why we need your help.\nWhy do I want it?\nWell, if you find yourself often needing to scan a photo or document but don't want to take up valuable bench space with a clunky old scanner or use crappy old fashioned software to do a simple document scan and email out then Scanbox is for you. \nScanbox has been designed to optimize nearly all lighting conditions so your scans always look great. \n\nScanbox also has many other uses:\n\nDigitize your receipts\nLive projector for presentations\nOptimized for face recognition when you scan photos\nScans 3D objects (great for eBay product shots)\nScan a page from a book (remember those!)\nTurns your phone into a photocopier\nScanbox is also unbelievable portable. It packs down flat to fit in your bag and is practically indestructible. When you want to use it simply unfold and let the high powered mini magnets to hold it together for you.\nWhat do I get?\nScanbox comes flat packed for your convenience and is ready to be assembled straight away. Each Scanbox is printed, creased, cut to size and flat packed. All magnets, stickers and instructions are included.\nWith Scanbox Plus we also include a set of LED lights to even out any shadows that may appear depending on the natural light direction (BYO 9V battery).\nBoth Scanbox's also come with a variety of color accents so just for fun you can change the color of the top of your Scanbox. [Red, Blue, Pink, Green, Black, Orange]\nWhat are the POPS and WHISTLES I get with Scanbox Plus ?\nScanbox Plus is completely enclosed by an additional back section. The complete white inside helps to diffuse light and reduce lens flare whilst maximising the scans color vibrancy. \nWe also include a set of LED Lights with wires (BYO 9V battery) so you can use Scanbox anywhere.\nTech Specs\nScanbox is designed to fit photos and documents up to a maximum of US Letter and A4 paper size.\nThe Dimensions of Scanbox when set up:\nHeight: 12.2 inches (310 mm)\nWidth: 12.2 inches (310 mm)\nDepth: 9.05 inches (230 mm)\nThe Dimensions of Scanbox when packed down:\nHeight: 0.19 inches (5 mm)\nWidth: 12.2 inches (310 mm)\nDepth: 9.05 inches (230 mm)\nWhat device does the Scanbox work with?\nScanbox is optimized to work with smartphones, especially the iPhone 4 and 4S. But it works just as well with any device that has a camera on the back.\nWhy do you need the cash?\nOur funding goal of $12,500 is calculated to be just enough to pay for the toolings and the materials the first production run and packaging cost. To print, cut and fold Scanbox onto durable laminated card we need to use a process called \"offset\" printing and to do this at an efficient price point we need to produce a minimum of 1000 units. We also need to buy at least 20,000 super strong neodymium magnets so Scanbox clicks together and folds down really easily.\nWhen will I get it? \nWow!! We are so greatful to the KS community for making our dream a reality and only 10 days into the project. Now we have reached our goal we will begin production of Scanbox immediately after the KS deadline. We hope to ship Scanbox in July/August 2012. We will keep you informed of how production is going with regular updates during this process. We can't wait to get started. \nAnything else?\nThere are numerous smartphone applications that will significantly increase the functionality of your Scanbox. We recommend CamScanner+ as the perfect accompaniment. It allows you to do OCR scans, scan directly to PDF, create multi-pages documents and upload directly to Google Docs. Note: we are not affiliated with Camscanner+ in any way, we just love the app and happen to think its the best one out there to use with Scanbox. (and we've tried most of them)\nThank You\nThank you so much for helping! Your pledge is hugely appreciated.\n\nFeel free to message us with any questions at info@limemouse.com and make sure you tell all your crazy friends on Facebook and Twitter to help us make this project a reality.\nThe Scanbox is patent pending.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #15", "update_userinfo": "They're on their way!", "update_content": "Hi folks, \nThe day we've all been looking forward to for a longtime has arrived! \nAfter an epic journey, Luke has achieved a lot, and for those that have been following the travel blog we hope it's been a good insight into the whole process, and how to tackle the issues that arise "}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #14", "update_userinfo": "Nearing completion.

Check it out! Also, there are a couple new rewards at the $35 and $200 levels! Is there anything missing? Ask us!\nUPDATE 5/25 11AM: We've sailed past our original goal and even hit our first stretch goal: CG Magazine will be reborn! YAY! Stay tuned for another stretch goal, and another surprise to thank all you wonderful supporters!\nUPDATE 5/21 6PM: OMG everyone, we're more than halfway there in 5 hours! HUGE thanks to everyone for spreading the word!\nWHO WE ARE\nCrossed Genres was formed in September 2008 as a science fiction & fantasy magazine, with few resources and almost no visibility. Since then, that little zine has grown into Crossed Genres Publications, a small indie press publishing not just the zine, but also speculative anthologies, collections and novels.\n(Above: Just a few of our covers)\nWe also spun off the Science in My Fiction blog, ran a big SiMF short story contest, ran two successful Kickstarter campaigns, and consistently reach thousands of people each month.\nDespite this success, CGP has never been profitable; we've lost about $10,000 from our own pockets in the past 3 1/2 years. We're okay with that \u2013 we knew going into it that we would lose money. We've continued because we love speculative fiction, and we love getting the work of talented yet undiscovered authors into the hands of readers.\nWe don't want to be forced to let CGP go, but due to the co-publishers unexpectedly losing their day jobs, we simply can't afford to lose money on the small press any longer. So we've launched this Kickstarter project to cover CGP's publishing costs through the end of 2013. The funds would pay for at least four publications before the end of next year.\n\nWHAT THIS KICKSTARTER WILL PAY FOR\n The $4000 goal will mostly go towards the content we publish; over half will go directly to authors and artists for fiction and cover art. The rest will pay for editorial, production and distribution costs, as well as some advertising/publicity. [Note: NONE of the money will go into our pockets. 100% of the funds raised will be invested in CGP and its publications. We'll be happy to simply not lose money any longer.]\n Projects in 2013 will include:\nMenial: Skilled Labor in SF (anthology, currently accepting submissions; release 1st quarter of 2013):\nOther people treat laborers like the dirt they work with. But skilled labor is crucial to the continuation of human culture on earth \u2013 and if we ever wish to visit the stars, skilled labor will be indispensable.\n We want stories about men and women who understand the nuts and bolts, the atmosphere and the water and the soil. You know \u2013 the things that keep us alive. We want characters who get their hands dirty every day; people who aren\u2019t too proud to work their bodies at least as hard as their minds.\n Winter Well, an anthology of speculative novellas about older women (currently accepting submissions; release 2nd quarter of 2013):\nWe\u2019re looking for speculative stories featuring women of advancing age (late middle age and older). They\u2019re smart, they\u2019re tough, and they have wills of their own.\n They may be warriors, politicians, adventurers, etc. Even if they are also wives, mothers, wise women or healers, those archetypes must not be their defining characteristics. Their motivations, their driving force, must be their own. Whatever was in their past, they\u2019re not interested in being in the background now.\n We want stories about women breaking free of suppression; we also want stories of women who\u2019ve been empowered all their lives.\nPlus at LEAST two additional titles released in the 2nd half of 2013.\nWe may add 1-2 additional projects depending on how successful the Kickstarter is. These titles haven't been decided yet \u2013 and some of the rewards for pledging give you the chance to influence what we publish!\nREWARDS\nThere are rewards for readers and for writers; for fans of ebooks and for fans of print. We're offering signed, rare & special books, t-shirts, writing critiques, input on the theme of an upcoming anthology, even the opportunity to name & describe a character in the upcoming novel of a NY Times bestselling author!\nFor the $50 reward, the ARC & Rarity Grab Bag, some of the books you might receive include:\nSigned copies, including Broken Slate by Kelly Jennings, Fat Girl in a Strange Land, Subversion, CG Magazine quarterlies, etc.\nAdvanced Reading Copy (ARC) of A Festival of Skeletons by RJ Astruc, Fat Girl in a Strange Land, Subversion, and others\nScience in My Fiction contest winners (only 80 copies were ever printed!)\nThere are others as well, but we have limited quantities, hence only offering 10 grab bags!\n CGP has been lauded for our cover art throughout our history, so for the Kickstarter we got permission from the artists to offer 8\" x 10\" photo prints of a few of our most popular covers. These prints are available only to supporters of our Kickstarter:\n\"Marshmallow Cat\" from issue #10 (Child Fiction) by Carl Pearce\nUntitled from issue #12 (LGBTQ) by Julie Dillon\n\"The Very Ugly Duckling\" from Quarterly 4 by Minna Sundberg\nUntitled from Fat Girl in a Strange Land by Lili Ibrahim\nHuge thanks to the artists and authors who contributed to the rewards!\nHere's the Geek Swears t-shirt that's one of the rewards:\nAnd the Runner Girl t-shirt, like the animation in our video!\nFor the customized LEGO sets: You choose any of the genres from Crossed Genres Magazine's issues, and we'll design a LEGO set for you crossing science fiction and/or fantasy with that theme! Like this one we made for ROMANCE, \"One Hundred Ten Ton Proposal\":\nWe'll write out detailed instructions for building it, and send them to you along with all the bricks and pieces to build it!\nCONCLUSION\n Crossed Genres Publications has been proud to bring new voices to appreciative readers. CGP has been the first sale for dozens of aspiring writers! (They always excitedly tell us so ;) Our diverse and unusual themes present challenges which writers have risen to magnificently, creating excellent and unique reading experiences. But unfortunately, that's now at risk.\nIf the fundraising goal isn't reached, then CGP will stop producing new books. We'll cancel the submission calls for Menial: Skilled Labor in SF and Winter Well, and after we release Daniel Jos\u00e9 Older's Salsa Nocturna in July and Sabrina Vourvoulias' INK in October, there will be no more new titles.\nWe don't want this to happen. And we hope that you don't either. We love discovering brilliant new stories and authors. Please help us keep doing so, and we'll continue to share them with you!\n Thanks,\nKay & Bart, co-publishers", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #39", "update_userinfo": "New Kickstarter to support Crossed Genres Magazine!

Hunt", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Upgrade almost any board game by replacing the player markers or tokens that came in the box with PennyGems. They're dazzlingly shiny, feel solid yet sensual to the touch, are very easy to pick up off a table (because of their raised edges), are non-skid, stack surprisingly well, have a nice weight to them, and are incredibly durable. Each one has an icon on one side which ensures that people who are color-blind or visually impaired can still easily identify different kinds, and the symbols also establish a rank or order for the colors, should a game need that. \nIf you haven't already spotted the sequencing code, I'll spill the beans. Just count the number of points on each shape. Oh, the football/cat's eye shape on the orange token is gonna get swapped out for a crescent moon in the final run, and the black seven-point spiral will be a little bit different as well. I'll also be making the green and blue tokens just a teensy bit darker. Sure, I could just make their shapes black, like the first four, but somebody might invent a clever use for the fact that the first four icons are black, and the last four are white. It seems a shame to mess up that little bit of symmetry.\nOh, wait, did I mention that they're kinda non-skid?\nPennyGems are made by printing UV-resistant ink onto chrome mirror-like self-adhesive vinyl labels, then covering the label with a dome of space-age polyurethane. The polyurethane is non-yellowing, self-healing, extremely resistant to a wide range of chemicals, and very durable, while also being slightly flexible and very pleasing to the touch. Two of these labels are placed on a penny. The penny gives the PennyGem token a satisfying weight in the hand. \nWhen I say \"UV-resistant,\" by the way, well, so, it's like this. A few years ago, I printed a decal for the side of my car. No polyurethane dome, no other kind of clear-coat or protective layer, just the ink on the vinyl. About two years later that car died and was hauled off to the wrecking yard. The decal on the side of the car didn't look any different than when I'd first applied it. However, the vinyl that I used was the 'outdoor-grade' stuff, which is used for putting graphics on buses and the like. For PennyGems, I'll be using the less expensive vinyl. According to the manufacturer, if you use their \"cheap\" vinyl on the side of a building or other outdoor location, they don't promise that it'll last for more than a month or so. So try to not leave them lying out on your sidewalk for more than a couple of weeks at a time, eh?\nNow, the manufacturer's predictions do not include the polyurethane dome. I've tested the polyurethane in boiling water (unaffected), ethanol (unaffected), concentrated hydrochloric acid (two hours, unaffected), methylene chloride (two days, surface was somewhat softened), and lacquer thinner (a few days, surface was just starting to dissolve). It resists being scuffed by sandpaper and such things, isn't very easy to cut through with a knife unless it's really really sharp, and has a tendency to self-heal small scratches or cuts.\nI took the still pictures that you see on this page just a day or two before launching the project, and the pictures show the same set of prototype PennyGems that you can see in the video. These tokens have been to three or four game night parties, were hauled all over GameStorm (and fondled by many more people than just the ones in the video), and generally been working pretty hard. My *previous* set of prototypes is almost three years old, and if I mix them in with the new ones, you cannot tell them apart if it weren't that they have different icons.\nIn fact, PennyGems would be a nearly-perfect game token, if not for one thing: the polyurethane is very expensive. Enough so that it really isn't feasible to sell them in retail stores. However, via Kickstarter, I can offer you these beautiful tokens at \u201cdirect from the factory\u201d prices, so to speak, thus keeping the final cost low enough to make it work. \nPennyGems are made by me, more or less by hand, in the U.S.A. (A very special 'thank you' to PlastiCreations for their assistance and access to their equipment.) PennyGems are shipped \u201csome assembly required,\u201d you'll need to stick the labels on pennies yourself, and you supply the pennies. Canadian pennies are the same size as the U.S. version, so Canadian buyers can select the non-international options; just add an extra $5 to cover shipping. For Kickstarter patrons who'd like to have some PennyGems but can't go down to their local bank to get a roll of U.S. one-cent coins, the International rewards include rolls of pennies, as well as the labels and international shipping costs.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #24", "update_userinfo": "The Newest PennyGems, for Netrunner", "update_content": "My apologies to those of you who've backed multiple PennyGems projects, and thus might see this  message more than once. \nIn about 90 minutes, at noon, Pacific Time, the Kickstarter project for the  newest members of the PennyGem family will launch: PennyGems for Netrunner.\nUnlike the original PennyGems, these designs are more game-specific, but if you or any of your friends play Fantasy Flight's Android: Netrunner, I'm certain you'll want to check these out.

Players will travel to exotic coffee-producing nations around the world to collect beans and gain fame and fortune.  But, in order to be successful, players will actually have to work together. Mostly.\nIn VivaJava, players send their researchers to hot spots around the globe to gather the perfect bean. This may bring them into contact with other players who are also on the hunt, creating a crucial choice: Go it alone and continue to research, or join forces with that opponent, hoping to combine beans from both player's bags and share the score with a superblend. Going it alone with research can often prove useful as players spend time in the lab developing abilities that grant them an advantage. However, in VivaJava the bold taste of victory will go only to those players who are able to balance solitary research with cooperation amongst their fellow gamers.\nThe rich depth of varying strategies and social play will satisfy most players' thirst for unique gameplay, but VivaJava has even more brewing. This flexible game can accommodate up to 8 players, and through smooth simultaneous actions, play is quick and constant with little downtime.\nBelow are some other useful links:\nOfficial VivaJava website\nVivaJava page on BoardGameGeek\nExcellent review on BGG that details game play\nVivaJava: The Coffee Game will be bursting at the seams with caffeinated gaming goodness. We've worked hard to develop the components to an exacting \"Euro feel\" with lots of wood, thick punchboard and beautiful artwork for an immersive theme. Here's what you'll find inside every copy of VivaJava:\n\u2022 Two game boards - why settle for just one board like all those other games? VivaJava's game boards are designed for multiple gaming configurations to account for gaming preferences, table shape, group size and whimsy.\n\u2022 Tons of punchboard - 8 thick Research Labs (personal tableaus), 9 country tokens, 8 Research/Blend Tokens, 12 Investment Tokens, 8 sets of three Blend Markers, 8 sets of five Research Markers, and 16 Blend Slates with custom coffee culture deco art.\n\u2022 Wood! 90 custom lathed wooden \"beans\" in six different colors (the heart of VivaJava). 8 chunky player pawns. 8 thick scoring discs.\n\u2022 Bags! 8 black fabric bags serve as the players' personal \"Roasters\" which are used to pull beans blindly while Blending with other players.\n\u2022 Cards! Two sets of cards in two different sizes - a deck of 16 mini-size cards (the Flavor deck), and 24 regular-sized cards for the inept but useful interns, part of the Intern Inspansion (plus 8 player reference cards).\n\u2022 Little plastic baggies! Have you ever opened up a game box and punched out about 18 gajillion little bits and then realized that the publisher didn't put any plastic baggies in the box for sorting? Don't you hate that? So do we - so we're putting some inside each box of VivaJava.\n\u2022 Rules! Yes, we'll even throw in a fully-illustrated, 16-page rulebook that will not only explain how to play, but will also provide advanced variants and strategy notes that will give you the upper hand amongst your over-caffeinated cohorts in no time.\nYou can even check out the pre-release rules right here!\nWe created this special \"geekspansion\" just for Kickstarter, and it's likely to be a long time (if at all) before it's offered for retail sale. We may put it in an expansion later, we may not - who knows! One thing's for sure - the only way to make sure you nab one is to get it on Kickstarter. And here's what makes it so special:\n\u2022 Four special Blend Slates - Each Slate features double bean colors for adding to The Fields. In addition, the team that claims the Blend Slate will receive +1 prestige points for creating a Blend that includes the featured bean color!\nClick here to embiggen image\n\u2022 A celebration of geekiness - The four Slates will embody themes that are near and dear to everyone's geeky hearts. Each week, we'll reveal one more Slate, but for a little teaser, here are the titles: Twin Perks, Whateley's Strange Brew, Caf\u00e9 LaBrea, and Lord of the Beans.\n\u2022 Four variant Country Tokens - These tokens feature abilities that can really add a shot of bold flavor to any game!\nNow that we've made our funding goal, gamers can rest assured of two things: 1) That VivaJava will be produced, providing coffee-gaming goodness to all of our wonderful backers, and 2) that Dice Hate Me Games is going to be providing more goodies for our backers for every funding milestone we reach!\nOur first stretch goal goodie is the burlap Bean Bag - perfect for holding all 90 of the wooden coffee beans in each copy of VivaJava. Since we reached $25,000, each backer who pledges for a pre-order copy of the game will receive a Bean Bag emblazoned with the official VivaJava logo!\nOur second stretch goal goodies are... Brewples!\nYes, if we reach $35,000, everyone who pledges for a pre-order copy of VivaJava will receive a randomly-selected Brewple, lovingly hand-crafted by Cherilyn. These vibrant player pawns can be used to designate the official Brewmaster - the player who oversees the game and acts as scorekeeper and general ringleader of awesomeness. \nThe third stretch goal was a components upgrade at $40K that offered new Blend Slates and a variant for the learning game - the Roaster Purge Tokens! More info. on that in Update #12.\nWe set the bar high for the next stretch goal at $47.5K and everyone answered magnificently. We are now able to put a new variant in each box of VivaJava - the Featured Blend Cards! \nThese cards allow players to score extra points whenever they create the Blend featured on the card. Learn more about this awesome stretch reward in Update #15!\nVivaJava is meant to be a social experience, so what better way to get a group into the game than taking it to your local coffee shop!

Players take on the roles of Tagon Toughs and a variety of other characters while working to achieve scenario specific goals.  Howard has been working on Schlock Mercenary for over a decade developing an excellent storyline and world while Kevin has been developing the rule set for the board game for several years. \nIn the video, you will see the prototype artwork that we have been using during the game's development.  Howard and his team will be producing the game with all original artwork.  The game itself will be professionally produced by Ludo Fact in Germany and will be available prior to GenCon to KickStarter supporters.\nSchlock Mercenary:The Board Game is a large undertaking and includes over 250 tokens, 36 floor tiles, 10 character sheets, full color rule/scenario book and dice.  It will includes roughly a hundred pieces of original artwork including top down floor tiles, plasma cannons, Scanners, turrets, Teraport Cages and more.   The game will come full to the brim with components and scenarios with more being released over the next few years.\nBy clicking on this Link, you can preview the very basic Learning rules that includes your standard actions and is the game that Howard played at GenCon 2011.  It includes only the rules needed to learn how to start and does not include full Teraport rules, Power Ups, Ranks/Titles and other special actions.  All supporters will be given access to a PDF that includes these rules plus artwork to print out the Learning games include characters and floor tiles.  The rulebook is currently a work in progress and will be updated as production comes closer.\nI'm very excited to bring you this game and I look forward to providing as much information as possible in the coming weeks.  We'll be at BoardGameGeek Con in Mid-November with copies of the game for playtesting for those interested.

I want every game that goes to a KickStarter supporter to have hefty wooden character discs with great illustrations on the top.  Wood and custom stickers so that you'll absolutely be able to raise up above the board requires more than the chipboard ones do.\n Every character (and drone) disc will be 1\" in diameter, 1/8\" thick of real wood.  The fully colored stickers (front and back) will be professionally printed of course.  These will be a nice addition to your game.\n - Oh, and we'll provide some additional chipboard tokens featuring a number of characters with their heads in the Nanny Jars.

Hunt", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Over a year ago, Clever Mojo Games jumped on the Kickstarter train with our first major game release, Alien Frontiers. People just like you--maybe even you yourself--sent us soaring to nearly 300% of our funding goal and helped put Clever Mojo Games on the map! Now we're back with an all-new board game called Sunrise City.  Take a look at the video above to get an idea of what Sunrise City is all about.\nGo ahead...I'll wait.\nSo, Sunrise City is a role selection, tile-laying, city-building board game. It's simple enough for kids of a reasonable age, friendly enough for family game night, and meaty enough for experienced gamers. It can be played by two, three, or four players and, depending on your experience, is playable in 60 to 90 minutes.\nAs you saw, a game of Sunrise City is played in three rounds and each round has four phases: Role Selection, Zoning, Bidding, and Construction. You can download the Prototype Rule Book PDF for all of the details, but lets take a quick look at each phase, below.\nAt the beginning of the game, before any of the rounds or phases start, each player is dealt four role cards.  From those four they select one card and pass the remainders left. They select a second card from the three cards they receive from the player on their right and again pass the remainders left. Finally, they select a third card from the two handed to them from the player on their right and return the unchosen cards to the game box. This is a simple draft and allows each player to choose their roles from nine possible cards. In the three rounds that make up a game of Sunrise City, the players will each choose one of their roles to use for the entire round and then discard it when the round is over. \nAt the top of each role card is a number. The player with the lowest role number each round will go first in each of that round's phases. At the bottom of each card is a description of that role's special ability. It could be a unique scoring opportunity, a means of harassing the other players, or a chance to bend the game rules in some special fashion. In general, the lower numbered cards have weaker role abilities, but give the player an increased chance of going first.\nAfter players have been dealt four zone tiles and four building tiles and chosen their role for the round, the zoning phase begins. Starting with the player with the lowest role card number, players take turns adding zone tiles to the city. Each tile represents a residential, commercial, industrial, parks & rec, or mixed use zone. \nAny zone type can be placed next to any other zone type, but the goal is to form zone combinations that match the building tiles in your hand so you can score points in the construction phase. Placing zone tiles adjacent to same-type zones already on the table will create a \"district\" and earn the player extra points.\nMixed in with the zone tiles are community tiles: Cathedral, Emporium, Fire Station, Zoo, and Police Station. These are the infra-structure of the city and they earn players extra points when they place certain building tiles in the areas surrounding the community tiles.\nAfter the players have added all of their zone tiles to the city, the bidding phase begins. Players are bidding to control the undeveloped zones so that they can construct buildings on them in the next phase. \nThe bidding system is simple, transparent, and cutthroat! Each player has a stack of six bid tokens and they take turns stacking them on undeveloped zones. To outbid another player you just stack your token on top of theirs. A player can \"close\" a bid by stacking one of their bid tokens on top of a bid stack where they already have the top bid. When the bidding is complete the markers on top of each stack are the winners and the markers underneath are returned to their players.\nEach building tile is made up of two building types that match the zone types mentioned earlier. When both buildings on the tile are the same type, the tile shows one larger building but it still counts as a separate building for placement and scoring. Each building tile also has three score numbers on it. The center number is scored by the player who adds the building tile to the city. The side numbers are scored by the players who controls the zone tiles on which the building is placed.\nIn the construction phase, there are two ways to add a building tile to the city. Placing a building tile directly on the zone tiles is \"ground floor construction\". The player must have one of their bid markers on at least one of the zone tiles on which the building tile is placed and the zone types much match the building types on both halves of the building tile. Placing a building tile on top of an existing building tile is \"upper floor construction\". In this situation, both halves of the new building tile must match the building types of the tile on which it is being placed. The player scores only the center number on the building tile and the side numbers are ignored. Bonus points are earned for adding odd numbered floors (3rd, 5th, 7th, etc...)\nThe community tiles that were added to the city during the zoning phase also affect scoring, giving a player an extra point if a matching type building tile is placed in an area surrounding the community tile.\nSo, there are lots of scoring opportunities, but what does that actually mean? Each player tracks their score on a ten-point score track, working their marker up the track for each point they earn. If a player's marker overshoots the top of the track, their marker wraps around and starts climbing again and the player earns one benchmark token. However, if the player's score marker lands on the star at the top of the score track by exact count, they earn two benchmark tokens. The player with the most benchmarks at the end of the third round is the winner.\nSunrise City is not a simple race for the most points, it a contest to grow the city in a manner that allows you to score the right number of points at the right time so that you can maximize your collection of benchmarks.\nThe Springboard Seal of Quality is your assurance that a new game project is worth your time and attention. All titles approved for Springboard campaigns are vetted by the game professionals at Game Salute. During this comprehensive evaluation process, Game Salute works with the publisher to ensure solid designs, thorough play testing, excellent presentation, and high quality components.\nThis Kickstarter funding project for individual gamers like you, is the first step in the overall Springboard campaign for Sunrise City. If we are successfully funded here on Kickstarter, the Springboard campaign will continue on to Phase II, a limited-time opportunity for retailers all around the world to get Sunrise City and the promotional exclusives.\nWe recognize and appreciate the important role that our Kickstarter Backers and Springboard Retailers are playing in the launch of Sunrise City and the success of Clever Mojo Games. Therefore, we make the following promises to you:\nThe promo cards and tiles noted as EXCLUSIVE will remain exclusive. We promise not to sell them individually or as a set, and not to include them as a part of any game expansion or re-printing. Once the Kickstarter Backers and Springboard Retailers have received their exclusive items they will NEVER be re-printed.\nSunrise City will be shipped to Kickstarter Backers at least two weeks before the items are available for purchase at ANY convention or store. Actual delivery dates will vary depending on your local postal service.\nStores who participate in Game Salute Preview Nights for Sunrise City will receive a preview copy for their Game Library in advance of the scheduled release date. \nI know this page is already three miles long, but I've got a lot to say. Below you will find some information about the variety of rewards available at the different pledge levels. From exclusive cards and tiles, to apparel, trinkets, art, and even your own image on a Role Card, I think we have something for everyone.\nWe have a set of nine EXCLUSIVE items for our Kickstarter Backers and Springboard Retailers. The primary character and building art is finished but the frame and borders are still being polished.\nFour Role Cards:\nDetective allows you to combine your zone tiles and the zone tiles of another player, choose the four you want to keep, and give the remaining four back to that other player.\nCity Planner allows you to rotate any zone tiles you control, thus changing the road layouts and possible zone combinations before you place building tiles on them.\nForeign Investor earns you floor points for even numbered floors. You already earn points for odd numbered floors, so now you'll be able to earn a bonus for every upper floor you add to the city.\nRe-Elected Socialite is a great last-round role as she allows you to choose a role card from any role that any players used in a previous round.\nFive Community Tiles:\nPower Plant subtracts a point for any Residential Building added in a surrounding area.\nUniversity subtracts a point for any Commercial Building added in a surrounding area.\nTheatre subtracts a point for any Parks & Rec Building added in a surrounding area.\nLibrary subtracts a point for any Industrial Building added in a surrounding area.\nStadium subtracts a point for any Mixed Use Building added in a surrounding area.\nWhat better way to show your support for Sunrise City than to wear a handsome, high-quality ball cap with an embroidered Sunrise City logo there for all to see and admire? The CITY PATRON levels are all about the cap, but the GROUND BREAKER and CIVIC LEADER pledge levels can add a cap to their other rewards for a small increase in the pledge amounts. The CITY SOCIALITE and CITY FOUNDER pledge levels include the caps. \nWhen you're sitting around the gaming table and telling everyone how you were the key to Sunrise City's success, you can dazzle your gaming buddies by pointing out the Sunrise City Key To The City lapel pin that you're wearing. The Key To The City Pin is included in the GROUND BREAKER, CIVIC LEADER, CITY SOCIALITE, and CITY FOUNDER pledge levels. This brass and enamel pin will become a treasured keepsake and make you the envy of all who game with you.\nIf you have a game room then you're definitely going to want some game art to hang on the walls, and we've got you covered.  We're making arrangements with Panda Games Manufacturing to set aside uncut printer sheets of role cards and building tiles for those Backers who pledge at the CITY SOCIALITE and CITY FOUNDER levels. I don't have the exact dimensions of the sheets yet, but I expect they'll be at least 20\"x30\".  Your friends will certainly appreciate your taste in art.\nThere are vanity license plates, and vanity book publishers, but those are nothing in comparison to a board game component!

Each turn players roll custom dice to perform actions such as purchasing route contracts, completing routes, making improvements, and moving cargo. Winning will require just the right mix of all these elements so hop aboard and roll some freight!\nIncludes (preliminary)\nhuge two-sided game board\n38 custom dice\n84 improvement and contract cards\n5 player mats\n100 partial rail cubes\n100 die-cut route completion sticks\n65 wooden cargo cylinders\ndrawstring bag\n10 player pawns\nfull-color rules\nSummary of Play\nEach turn players roll their set of custom colored dice and and then use the results to perform actions. Actions include purchasing contracts, building rail routes for those contracts, purchasing improvements such as additional dice, and delivering cargo. Some of these actions, such as purchasing contracts and building rail routes, require certain dice colors while other actions can be performed with dice of any colors. Completing rail routes and delivering cargo over those routes score the player victory points.\nWhy We Need Your Help\nRolling Freight is by far our most ambitious project to date. Years of research and playtest went into the design. You may have seen Rolling Freight at any of a number of the Puffing Billy tournaments at game conventions over the last couple of years, and we'll be running it at Origins and Gen Con again this year.\nWe're really excited to bring it to print, and are doing everything we can to scrape together the money. One look at the component list above and you'll see that this will be no easy task.\nOne avenue we're pursuing is Kickstarter. We have several different levels of support, and hope that you will consider one of them so that we can get Rolling Freight - rolling!\nHow Pre-Orders Work\nBy supporting Rolling Freight at the $60 or higher level, you will receive at least one (1) copy of the game once the printers complete it and it is freighted over. At that point, we will ship the game and the extras to your door. Based on all expectations, it will be roughly 3-4 months after the KickStarter program is over for the games to arrive in Houston and another few days for us to perform a bit of Quality Control and mail it out to all our supporters.\nHow Shipping Works\nCustomers in the U.S. will be sent the game(s) free of charge. This includes Alaska and Hawaii. All other international customers will be contacted about additional shipping costs, after the $10 discount. Shipping a Medium Flat Rate Box to Canada or Mexico costs about $28, so your cost would be about $18. Shipping a Medium Flat Rate Box to most other countries costs about $45 before the $10 discount.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #44", "update_userinfo": "Hey Rolling Freight Backers - APE has a New Kickstarter!", "update_content": "It's been awhile since I checked in, but I wanted to let you know that we have a new Kickstarter campaign in progress for our upcoming game Spirits of the Rice Paddy.\nSpirits is a relatively heavyweight agriculture simulation for 1-4 players.
