Features famed improv comedian Colin Mochrie of Whose Line is it, Anyway?\n\u2191\u2191\u2191\u2191 WATCH OUR TRAILER ABOVE \u2191\u2191\u2191\u2191 \nThen check out more videos at: www.actsocialfilm.com\nStory Summary\nIn improv, everyone's ideas have equal worth; this is what starting off on the right foot looks like.\nImprovisation tools are already working in conflict resolution and mental health facilities, but on a small scale. Could they be used to heal the Israeli-Palestinian conflict or help 40 million people in the USA to get off of psychotropic drugs?\n\u00b7  Republican Karl Rove performs improv with Colin Mochrie and endears himself to a room half-full with Democrats.\n\u00b7  Dr. Daniel J. Wiener brings couples back from the brink of divorce using improv.  \n\u00b7  Bob Kulhan, author of Getting to Yes And: The Art of Business Improv, teaches 40 Senators on their annual retreat to aid in their cross-aisle reaching. \n\u00b7  Brendan Fitzpatrick\u2019s dad died in 9/11; he uses improvisation to help him overcome the tragedy.\n\u00b7  Doctors help patients cure depression and social anxiety with improv techniques.\nThese stories and more combine to create a documentary about applied improvisation that entertains, enlightens, and offers a concrete, actionable solution to our tendency to de-humanize people with whom we disagree. \nTopic Summary\n30% of the people we interviewed in a random cross-section of the population didn\u2019t know what the word \u201cimprov\u201d means.  The other 70% had no knowledge of how improv is done.  Not a single person we interviewed mentioned the key principle of improv: \u201cYes And.\u201d\nIn Times Square, 1 in 3 people didn't know what improv was!\nDigging a little further, I found that improv comedy classes are an extremely niche activity, with less than 5 million people taking part worldwide.  In comparison, 265 million people currently take part in organized soccer leagues.  \nTo the general public, improv is a mysterious and unknown entity even though the sketch comedy show, Saturday Night Live, which stars top improv comedians, gets at least 8 million viewers a week, and the improv comedy show Whose Line is it, Anyway? averages 2 million viewers a week.  Act Social will explain the public\u2019s lack of interest in learning how to do improv.\nMindfulness, yoga, and meditation have had an explosion in growth in the last two decades.  The medical establishment has embraced mindfulness as a healing modality and patients can have those types of activities covered by health insurance.  If studies have shown improv to have the same kinds of therapeutic effects as mindfulness, why are so few doctors recommending it?  Act Social will explore this disparity. \nApplied improvisation specialists have had success reconciling refugees of genocidal civil war\u2026so why aren\u2019t the United Nations using more applied improvisation?  Act Social will explain why.\nArtistic Approach\nThere a few unique styles we\u2019ll use to serve different parts of the story:\nIn the section where we tell the history of improv, we\u2019ll use fun animations.\nOne our animations by Cas Kowalewski.\nThe stories of our main subjects will be told through filming of behavior, archival footage, and confessional interviews.\nWhenever onstage improv performance is shown, we\u2019ll use rockumentary style shots.\nInterviews on the street will have a \u201cGood Morning America\u201d feel, as we connect to the general public to test their improv knowledge.\nProject Stage and Timeline \nDevelopment.  We have shot over 40 hours of interviews with star Colin Mochrie, and top applied improvisation teachers like Bob Kulhan, Barbara Tint, and Brad Fortier.  This summer we will shoot with Mick Napier of Annoyance Theatre, Patricia Madson, author of Improv Wisdom, and original SNL writer, Anne Beatts.  We'll also do additional shoots with our main protagonists like Brendan Fitzpatrick of Tuesday's Children.  \nWe\u2019ve already shot improv for conflict resolution classroom footage, as well as person-on-the-street interviews.  I have read every improv book I can get my hands on and researched the history of the art dating back to the early 1900s.  \nWe will culminate our shooting with a performing and teaching tour that will end up at the United Nations and Capitol Hill.\nWe will wrap up production by early Summer 2020, and be ready to submit to Sundance in Fall 2020.\nAudience and Distribution\nDistribution and Marketing Strategy\nWe have a bona fide television star in the film, Colin Mochrie.  We will use his interest in the field of applied improvisation to promote the film. There has been an explosion of stand up comedy specials on Netflix and as we mentioned before there is a huge interest in improv comedy in this country.\nIntended Audience \nOur main target is lovers of stand up, improv comedy, The Office, Whose Line is it, Anyway? and Curb Your Enthusiasm fans.  That market is in the tens of millions in the U.S. alone.  Beyond that, we want to set up special screenings for people dealing with social anxiety disorder or depression.  \nAudience Engagement and Social Impact\nI feel very strongly about getting 100 million people improvising by 2025.  In the next six years, if we can train 1 million teachers to competently teach a Level 1 theatre improv class, and each of those teachers trains 100 students in the seventh year\u2014we\u2019ve hit 100 million improvisers.  \n\"Zip-zap-zop\" is a well-known improv warmup game.\nThat concrete goal is great to shoot for, but philosophically for me it\u2019s less about hitting a number and more about getting \u201cYes And\u201d thinking diffused into the vernacular of everyday speech\u2014with those saying it having had the physical experience of Improv Level 1 to back up the words.\nWe will encourage our audience to find the improv school in their city\u2014and we plan to start an online improv school for those in rural communities.  One of the places we hope people will be able to go one day is to an online \u201cRec Room\u201d  to meet other members of the Act Social Club.  There, people could pick an avatar and improvise with others from around the world.\nDirector/Producer Bio\nSean A. Mulvihill is known for creating and starring in the 2007 docu/drama feature film, Living Luminaries: On the Serious Business of Happiness. The film stars Eckhart Tolle (The Power of Now), 2020 presidential candidate Marianne Williamson, Don Miguel Ruiz (The Four Agreements), and Rev. Michael Bernard Beckwith.  www.livingluminaries.com\nSean resides in New York City and is the Artistic Director of the Exuberants Improv Comedy Team which tours the greater NYC area.  A trained actor, clown and mime, Sean is fluent in Italian and holds an MFA in Physical Theatre from the Accademia dell'Arte in Arezzo, Italy and a BFA in Acting from the University of Southern California.  www.seanamulvihill.com\nFundraising Strategy and Crowdfunding Impact\nWe are piecing together the additional funding needed by submitting grant proposals to Sundance Institute and IDA.  If we don't receive the institutional funding we have requested, we may launch a second Kickstarter for post-production funds next year.  Any remaining money will come from this current crowdfunding campaign and from my own investment.\nFunding to Date\nSo far, I have put about $20,000 of my own money into the project.  \nAmount Requested/Funding Impact of Production Phase \nWe have already met our base goal of $5000.  Thanks to those who have pledged already.  This money will be used for 3 things:\n1.  Production expense of a film shoot on-location in Chicago with Annoyance Theatre founder, Mick Napier, famed improviser Susan Messing, and applied improviser, Dr. Kristin Krueger.  \n2.  Animation to illustrate key portions of our story.\n3.  Production expense of a film shoot on-location in Washington, D.C., where we'll lobby politicians to give improv a try.\nStretch Goal\nWe reached our goal!  Now it's time to STRETCH!\nI believe the most important thing we can do with Act Social is to give people from all walks of life a chance to try improv.  Most improv schools are in cities and the rural segment of the population does not have easy access to them.  So we want to take the improv to them! \nWe plan to hit the road and go on tour to bring free improv shows/workshops to rural communities more than an hour\u2019s drive from an improv class.  Alternatively, we'll bring improv to poorer areas of larger cities where residents are less likely to venture out to take a class.  We'll bring our cameras and tell the stories of these people learning improv for the very first time.\nIt will cost around $2000 to get our cast and crew to each city on the tour, so the more we raise, the more towns we can improvise with!\nCurrent Sample\nPlease visit our website www.actsocialfilm.com to see the videos there which we\u2019ve made to explain our project and the task at hand.\nRewards\n\u201cYour film is cool but\u2026what\u2019s in it for me?\u201d\nRest assured we have AMAZING rewards for backers of this campaign.

It\u2019ll teach you skills that can be used in real life & in business.\nPlay CEO as you navigate through opportunities and pitfalls in the game. Make tough calls that can risk your profits or give you the ultimate climb at the end of the year.\nLook, we get it - finance may not look like the most fun thing to do. It seems super complicated and, to be honest, difficult. But it doesn\u2019t have to be that way. We first made Easy Profit Game to teach franchise owners how to run their business finances. We didn\u2019t want to use another boring training manual, so we turned finance into an easy to learn, easy to play, game.\nYour goal in Easy Profit Game is simple - MAKE THE MOST PROFIT!\nThough the goal is simple, the steps to get there will have plenty of challenges. You\u2019ll be required to make tough decisions, possibly take loans, and balance risk & reward. \nFor more details, visit www.EasyProfitGame.com in the \u201cRun Your Business\u201d section.\nThe journey will teach you valuable lessons and skills needed to properly run a business and maximize your profits!\nThe Month to Month\nThese moves will either increase your sales, cost you big, or both. Fill in the blanks on the game sheets to ultimately determine your End Of Year Profits!\nSales Cards\nBut don\u2019t just take everything as it comes, sometimes a gain now will cost later. Conversely, taking a loss now may mean larger earnings later. Pay close attention to each opportunity and weigh your options carefully.\n\nCompany Cards\nEvery company runs into operational situations that require extra capital. Initially, these may come across as annoying expenses, but don\u2019t be so quick to judge. Sometimes, these expenses can end up being profitable investments. \nLearn how to deal with operational expenses and flip them to not just keep your company afloat but to turn a HUGE PROFIT.\nTaking Loans\nThe CEO can make a decision to take a long-term loan and get some immediate cash to keep the company going through the year. However, this will affect your end of year profits (overall results for the game).\nIf your bank account does drop to zero, you are required to take a loan as a company can\u2019t operate on negative cash.\nEnd of Month Reports\nAt the end of each month (round), each company is required to report its progress. This is an amazing time to see how your competition is faring and see if you need to reevaluate your plans.\nThe progress is reported by looking at the bottom line to see if it was positive or negative. If it was positive then the Economic Health card turns to the black (black side up) indicating that the company is making money. If the bottom line is negative them the Economic Health card turns to the red (red side up) indicating that the company is losing money. Economic health is determined by the collective performance of companies in the same region (group of teams). When your month ends, look around at the other teams to check the status of their Economic Health cards to determine if you will use declining, stable or growing revenue amounts for the next month.\nExtra Tips \nLearn to listen to other companies and your partners as you play. They may have solutions or ideas that may help you with your current situation or next. Trade knowledge and ideas, and you may find that a win-win approach may end up serving you the best. \nWhen the year is closed, the winner of the game is determined by the highest profit. But where the game ends, life continues. Talk with your fellow players and reflect over what lessons were learned through the game. How will this affect your personal finances, how you run your business, or how you navigate through work?\nEasy Profit Game was first created to be a fun way to teach franchisees how to handle and run their business finances.\nThey raved about how practical and fun it was and brought the samples to their own families. Soon enough, kids and teenagers were joining them in learning vital skills on how to run a business - all while having a blast with their families!\nNow, Easy Profit Game is coming to you. Get your friends and family engaged and excited as you all become financially literate and start GAINING PROFIT!\n We will start shipping games approximately 2 months after the end of the Kickstarter campaign.\nJerrod Sessler, a former NASCAR driver, technology engineer, and Navy Petty Officer, has always been an innovator. In 1999, after being diagnosed with stage four metastasized melanoma, and given a five percent chance of survival, Jerrod opted to pursue alternative means of treatment by moving to a plant-based diet. Now, twenty years after his grim diagnosis, Sessler is fit, healthy and cancer free without conventional medical treatment.\nIn 2004 Sessler founded HomeTask, a service company using the franchising business platform to grow great brands such as Pet Butler, Lawn Army, and Yellow Van Handyman. The company has grown by franchising branded locations nationwide. Sessler received dual engineering degrees in manufacturing and mechanical and has brought his systems knowledge into the franchising industry. As a result of his passion for health and fitness, Jerrod founded Freggies, an organic produce delivery service, and Hot Feet Fitness, a workout, stretch & yoga studio concept.\nSessler was nominated as the Small Business Association (SBA) Person of the Year in 2007 and was named SBA Veteran Champion of the Year in 2010 for his work in offering significant discounts to veterans so that they can start their own businesses. In 2009 Sessler became a published author with his book \u201cFive Percent Chance,\u201d which shares his story of surviving cancer and taking responsibility for his health.  He later authored \u201cFood Chains\u201d and \u201cFive Minute Workout\u201d in 2013. These days you can find Sessler spending time with his family, leading the HomeTask Network, and serving in his hometown of Burien, Washington.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe've worked extremely hard to prepare this product for Kickstarter and full-scale manufacturing and fulfillment, but here are what we see as the risks and our plan to assess them:\n \n MANUFACTURING: The manufacturer is lined up and we have done testing with all of the various game pieces.\n \n FULFILLMENT: Barring any odd circumstances, there are no obstacles with regards to fulfillment that we anticipate.

Without politics or being angry at bad guys. This book features a strong focus on adding luxury to your life instead of sacrifice. And the frosting on the cake is saving a lot of money.  \nThere have been too many recent reports that have spelled out \"it's too late.\" Maybe if the authors of those reports get this book, they will change their report to \"there's still hope! If enough of us do the stuff in this book ....\"\nWe all hear about the problems. And usually the solutions are to shake our fists at \u201cthe bad guys.\u201d Personal solutions are often about sacrifice: be cold in the winter, eat sawdust, volunteer for dysfunctional organizations, write to politicians, travel less, buy crap marketed as \u201cgood for the environment,\u201d take cold showers\u2026 I need to point out that most of that stuff makes almost no difference, and some of those things actually make the problems worse. In this book, I put a number on those things and I show the numbers for things that really make a HUGE difference.  Save the planet, turn the heat up in winter, take hot showers, eat delicious food, and save thousands of dollars along the way!\nAnd most of all, no anger required. Go ahead and be angry at the bad guys if you want. But I wish to show you a path that will be a thousand times more effective. It turns out to be easy. \nLet\u2019s get to it!

How cool is it that so many people are trusting me with their coin for six months? I see other kickstarters that make it clear \"we will sell this for $20 after the kickstarter, so give us $40 for it now.\" I think it should be the opposite of that. You are throwing your shoulder in with me to get this done. You are being far more trusting and supportive than people that wait. So I want you to have the best price, and lots of bonus candy! \nRewards: THANKS ($1 and up)\nFirst I have to explain something new we are trying in this kickstarter. The extra goodies are handed out as \"gift codes.\" On my seventh kickstarter, some people said that the goodies didn't have value for them because they got most of those goodies in a previous kickstarter.   So this time I am handing them out as gift codes. You can give them to yourself or give them to somebody else.\n4 gift codes for the Permaculture Playing Cards as an ebook: My third kickstarter was the permaculture playing cards. Each card covers a powerful aspect of permaculture. Some feature people, some feature a philosophy, and some feature a technique. There's so many details on every card that it takes about an hour and a half to read them all!\n4 gift codes for Care and Feeding of a Rocket Mass Heater: The microdoc from the kickstarter for the 4-DVD set \"Better Wood Heat: DIY Rocket Mass Heaters.\" Switching from electric heat to a rocket mass heater can reduce your carbon footprint as much as parking seven cars! This is a DIY wood burning contraption that can heat your home with one-tenth the wood that a conventional wood stove uses, and puts out about a hundredth of the smoke. This is a 30-minute video showing five different people using a rocket mass heater and talking about their favorite way to light and care for rocket mass heaters.\n4 gift codes for Cooking with a Rocket Oven: The microdoc from the kickstarter for the Rocket Ovens DVD. A rocket oven has a lower footprint than any other kind of oven. And rather than bringing in electricity, propane, or natural gas, a rocket oven can run on nothing but the sticks that fall in your yard - truly off grid. They can also heat up in less than 15 minutes and put out barely any smoke. This video is a 19 minute video of starting and tending a rocket oven, complete with footage of delicious-looking food coming out of the oven.\n4 gift codes for Hugelkultur: The microdoc from the kickstarter for the 3-DVD set \"World Domination Gardening.\u201d This 16 minute video covers Hugelkultur, a gardening technique that builds amazing soil and after a few years can completely eliminate the need for irrigation. Once set up, Hugelkultur beds can drastically reduce the amount of work involved in growing your own food and reducing a significant source of your carbon footprint.  \n 21 Podcast Review of Sepp Holzer\u2019s Permaculture. This book by Sepp Holzer is one of my favorite books. He details a way of working with nature to solve problems that is absolutely genius. In these recordings, I spent roughly 25 hours reviewing every page and hashing through every detail of this amazing book.\n Public Thanks: I've seen some other kickstarters do this and I think we do it much, much better. They post your name to a facebook page where it is lost and forgotten within a couple days. We post it to our thread at permies.com where we have perennial discussions. Thousands of people will actually look at the list for years to come. And, naturally, we will give you a chance to be as creative and as silly as you want. While some people will post their names, or their kids, or maybe plug their business, you can also divulge your plans for world domination and give yourself all the galactic titles you want. Check out the thanks page from our last kickstarter and the one before that.\nRewards: CANDY ($5 and up)\n Permaculture Experience ebook (gift code).   Also known as the PEP book.  This version of the book is called \"version 0.7 beta\" - so it is an early draft.   And even in its early state, people are enjoying it.  This is a long list of experiences that you can do at home.   And when each experience is complete, you post a picture and have your experience verified.  When you have completed enough experiences, you are \"PEP1 Certified.\"  Details here and here.\n4 gift codes for HD streaming of the Building a Cob Style Rocket Mass Heater DVD. This video shows the full build of a rocket mass heater in a log structure and another full build of a rocket mass heater in a tipi. This is the crown jewel from the kickstarter for the 4-DVD set \"Better Wood Heat: DIY Rocket Mass Heaters.\"\n4 gift codes for The Design and Build of the Giant Solar Food Dehydrator. In this 1 hour and 21 minute video from the kickstarter for the Rocket Ovens DVD, you can follow along with the group at an Appropriate Technology Course as they discuss the merits of design elements, and then go on to the build of the dehydrator.\n4 gift codes for the 5 hour video tour of Wheaton Labs from the kickstarter for recording the 2017 Permaculture Design Course and Appropriate Technology Course held at Wheaton Labs.\n Access to the permies.com \"Secret Inner Circle\" forum: Join our past kickstarter supporters in a place where you can talk about stuff without the prying eyes of google or \"them\".\nRewards: Physical Copies or eBook Copies ($25 and up)\nThis book was written with the idea that people might buy a bunch of books to give to others in an effort to affect significant change through mass education.\nOnce the kickstarter is over, everybody will get a kickstarter \"survey\" so I can get all sorts of details from you about your preferences. People that supported the kickstarter at $25 or more will be asked how many physical books they want. The remaining number that they paid for will be converted 3-to-1 from physical books to eBook gift codes.\nFor example, at the $100 level, folks can choose between 12 physical books or 36 ebook gift codes. Or a mix! The survey question will ask how many physical books you want. Maybe you will put in \"8.\" So the remaining 4 books are converted, 3-to-1, to 12 eBook gift codes. I will send you 8 physical books and 12 eBook gift codes.\nSome people have asked \"how do the shipping fees work?\" Unfortunately we do not have the ability to scale shipping fees based on the number of physical books selected at a particular reward level. Each reward level has a set shipping fee associated with it according to location. If you are getting only ebook gift codes, then you can select \"US Virgin Islands\" as your shipping location and the shipping charge will be $0 and you will receive 0 physical books.  It's not perfect, but it's the best we can do within the system.\nAnd if you are actually in the US Virgin Islands and want physical copies... get in touch and we'll figure something out.\n\nRewards: GLORY ($100 and up)\n Put your most creative name in the book! (80 character limit). We will reserve a page (more if needed) that says \"Thanks to our Magnificent Kickstarter Supporters!\" Your name appears in our book! Or maybe \"in memory of ____\" or \"mysuperhomestead.com\" or \"The Fabulous Finnegan Family\" or \"Paul Wheaton stinks of old fish\" or \"There once was a gal from Nantucket ...\"  or maybe it is time you gave yourself some excellent galactic titles like \"His Grace, the Duke of Soft Cheeses\" or \"Supreme Ruler of the Bacteria in my Garden\".\nEarly access to the rough manuscript, plus the opportunity to give last minute feedback.\nRewards: ROCKET ($150 and up)\n1 gift code for HD streaming of the rocket mass heater 8-DVD set. This 8-DVD set is a combination of the Wood Burning Stoves 2.0 4-DVD set and the Better Wood Heat: DIY Rocket Mass Heaters 4-DVD set, both projects from previous kickstarters.\n1 gift code for HD streaming of the Rocket Ovens DVD from my last kickstarter. This video covers, in intricate detail, the building of a rocket oven that is better for the environment than any other kind of oven. \nRewards: PDC and ATC ($200 and up)\n 100 hour recording of the 2017 Permaculture Design Course at Wheaton Labs. Even if you already have decades of homesteading experience, this course will show you how to think like a designer. It covers permaculture design concepts and themes, climate and land forms, working with water, soil quality and care, trees, crops, microorganisms, sustainable livestock management, botany, and so much more! You can fit a lot of great info into 100 hours!\n 77 hour recording of the 2017 Appropriate Technology Course at Wheaton Labs. In this course you will learn the thought process and practical steps for building systems that help you live both sustainably and comfortably. This course covers solar power, cooling strategies for warm climates, heating strategies for cold climates, home water systems, and many other appropriate technology solutions.\nAbout the Authors\nPaul Wheaton is a giant doofus who is bonkers about permaculture. He won\u2019t shut up about permaculture. On and on, every day ... it\u2019s annoying. He has gone so far as to make a 3-DVD set that is just about the earthworks for permaculture gardening. And not only did he make a 4-DVD set about rocket mass heaters, but he made ANOTHER 4-DVD set about rocket mass heaters. Why on earth do people need 8 DVDs about something so simple? If you think that is ridiculous, take a look at his 177 hours of video of a full Permaculture Design Course, and Appropriate Technology course. Then there\u2019s the cards. Okay, the permaculture playing cards are pretty cool. \nBefore all of that, Paul created hundreds of podcasts, youtube videos, articles, and other bits and bobs about permaculture. That should have been the first sign, right there, that health professionals should have stopped all this. That, or his 26,000 forum posts at permies.com. And he has at least that many at his other site, CodeRanch.com. Oh, yeah, he used to be a software engineer before all this permaculture stuff.\n  Shawn Klassen-Koop\u2019s passion for building a better world grew from many years of working at a summer camp. This time inspired awe and wonder for the natural world through many hours camping in the woods, paddling on a lake, or sleeping under the stars. Seeking to solve world problems with clever thinking, Shawn decided to pursue computer engineering as a career, where he learned the importance of good design and strong critical thinking. In time he felt like modern technology was causing more problems than it was solving and started looking for a better way. It was then that he stumbled upon and fell in love with permaculture as a way to use his design skills to work with nature rather than against nature. Shawn was preparing to start his own homestead when he was faced with serious health challenges that prevented him from doing any physical work. It was during this time that the opportunity to work on this book came up. Shawn jumped on it, wanting to do whatever he could to share these ideas with others. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nA lot of kickstarters want to get funding before the people doing the kickstarter have done much of anything. Before they have any skin in the game. We have been working on this book now for over a year and have already finished writing all 32 chapters (plus 2 appendices) and revised them numerous times along the way. We have brought this project as far as we can before paying for artwork, editing, layout, printing, and a few other bits and bobs. So all of the challenges writers face are behind us. Now we face the exciting world of \u201cself pub\u201d which is new to us.

Science shows that room temperature should be between 68-72 degrees for the optimum sleep benefits. \nHush Iced can help you get there by preventing you from overheating, even during the nastiest heat wave. \nHush Iced uses the same advanced weight distribution technology as the classic Hush Blanket, but with a lighter, cool-to-the-touch cover. Hush Iced\u2019s proprietary bamboo and cotton blend helps wick away sweat during hot summer months, while still providing weighted relief.\n At Hush, we believe in love at first sleep! If you do not absolutely love your blanket after night one, we will give you 99 more tries or your money back!\n Two years ago, we came up with the idea for the Hush Blanket, a weighted blanket designed for those who wanted to relax and fall asleep, fast. But we noticed one thing, Hush was great during fall and winter, even during spring, but it was admittedly hard to use during the grueling, hot summer months. And we found that was the case with most other weighted blankets.\nWe set out to change that.\nHush Iced was created for use even when it\u2019s hot out, with an amazing breathable fabric and a lighter, cool-to-the-touch cover, so you can stay cool and calm all summer long.\n\n This project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 650+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $300MM raised between them.\n We can\u2019t thank you enough for checking out our project and helping us make Hush a reality. \nWe know not everyone will be able to support us with a pledge, so even if you can\u2019t give a dollar or purchase a Hush Iced blanket, if you\u2019re a supporter of Hush, you can help us spread the word on Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, Instagram and anywhere else you can think of! \nCheck out our other weighted blankets in Canada.\n\nYour Hush Iced blankets will be shipping July 2019! We\u2019re able to get them to you so soon because we are backed with great manufacturers who lead the production of our first Hush blankets. \nInternational shipping costs will be paid after the campaign when accurate shipping costs are calculated for your country.\nIf we get enough pledges from each country, we can send your Hush blankets in bulk, which would cost even less in shipping!\nIn addition, not charging international shipping on Kickstarter means it\u2019s excluded from Kickstarter\u2019s commissions -- and we can pass those savings on to you!\nYou will be able to choose different add-ons and update your shipping addresses 1-2 weeks after the campaign ends in the post-campaign survey, which can affect shipping price.

Although the skin is the body's largest organ, many of us take it for granted.\n               As part of Orijin's mandate to promote self-care and mindfulness, we\u2019ve developed the 100% all-natural and biodegradable Orijin Sponge. Made from Japanese Konjac Plant Root and infused with anti-microbial bamboo charcoal, the Orijin Sponge will provide your skin with the TLC it deserves while also heightening your showering experience. \n Most bathing sponges you\u2019ll find in-store or online today are made with the use of chemicals, synthetic oils, plastic and artificial coloring. These \u201cglorified plastic bags\u201d as we like to call them, are a breeding ground for dank smells and bacterial growth, do absolutely nothing for our skin and take over 150 years to decompose!\nMade completely from 100% all natural Konjac plant root, the Orijin sponge's powerful fibers are naturally alkaline and hydrating. In addition, the Orijin Sponge exfoliates even the most sensitive skin without irritation.\nInfused with Bamboo Charcoal, the Orijin Sponge is anti-microbial allowing the konjac fibers to absorb debris and impurities without allowing bacteria to grow or linger.\nThe Orijin Sponge is ergonomically designed to fit perfectly in hand while providing great coverage for an easy and thorough full body scrub down.\nSaid to have been discovered by Japanese farmers who used konjac to wash their babies' skin because of the plants gentle and natural features,  Konjac is native to Japan and has been used since the 6th century. \nWhen Dry, the Orijin Sponge is 3x smaller dimensionally and more than 11.5x lighter in weight. When dry the Orijin Sponge weighs only 17grams and when fully hydrated it increases to the perfect weight of 198g.\n Feel free to use the Orijin Sponge all over your body, especially on the chest, back & face.  These areas are easily acne-prone and need an extra deep clean. The Orijin Sponge is gentle enough to be used on sensitive areas, like around your eyes, while tough and sturdy enough for a full body scrub down. \n3D Design Rendering | Orijin Sponge\n The surface of the Orijin Sponge was designed to help channel water away from the surface for a better lathering experience and for more efficient drying time when the Orijin Sponge is not in use.   \n There\u2019s no comparison. Based on our ergonomic size, design properties and environmental footprint we take the lead by a long shot. \nJust last year more that 4,000 awesome supporters brought The Thinking Egg (our previous campaign) to life, making it the most successful mindfulness tool to ever launch on Kickstarter. The feedback after having shipped on time to all of our supporters was awesome. We'll be continuing that tradition come fulfillment time for your Orijin Sponge!\n \n   At Orijin, we intentionally design products that harmoniously intertwine form and function.\n Our hope is that we can provide you with products and ideas to help live a more present, aware and conscious life.\nThank you for taking a look at our campaign. If you have any questions, please reach out, we'd be happy to help!\n   This project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 650+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $300MM raised between them. \nThis project is promoted by Green Inbox", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhile we have budgeted sufficient resources and time, we know that there might be things outside of our control and current visibility.

You fall asleep with a peaceful smile on your face, just to awaken suddenly at 2am by the shivering cold. You become restless, your teeth begin chattering, and you just can't get warm!\nYou\u2019re miserable, freezing, rolling in and out of pitiful sleep knowing this is going to be a long, dreadful night. \nThere are options for getting warm. But so few of them actually include SLEEP. \nAnd isn\u2019t that what you came here to do? \nNow, imagine the same scenario. Only this time when you wake up cold at 2am, you simply drift right back off to sleep in a warm and toasty slumber, because instant warmth is at your fingertips by just the push of a button.\nModern Warmth \nIn the past, our options for warming up in the wild have been limited (to say the least)...\n Chemical Hand Warmers? Awesome. My body has turned to ice, but at least my palms are sweating!  Besides, single use chemical warmers? They hit the trash and poison our planet, no thanks. \n Heat up water in my Nalgene? Listen, I'm the only one that should be needing to take a leak here. Waking up soaked because my bottle decided to tinkle? That's a bit counterproductive to the mission here. (this has actually happened to me, not cool. COLD, yes. but way not cool)\n Do jumping jacks, push-ups, run in place? What is this? 24 Hour Fitness?! 2am is for restful, restorative sleep, NOT getting swole.\n What Else? Rekindle the fire, heat up a rock, snuggle a bear, crawl into the wolves den?!! Maybe! People get desperate when they're cold!  I don't know about you, but I make it a habit to avoid 3rd degree burns (or animal maulings) in the wild. \n..And the list of heat-producing methods goes on and on and on. Most of which do NOT actually involve sleeping through the night.\nAfter more cold, sleepless nights in the wild than I care to admit, I vowed to fix this problem with a reliable, sustainable, and modern solution that does not require disrupting your cozy sleeping quarters in search of warmth.\nand so... the Hot Pocket was born! \n How it Works\nWhat backers are saying:\n\"Have enjoyed two of the Sierra Madre products I've already backed and received and look forward to Ninox too. I trust this brand and have this exact problem with staying warm.\" \n\"My wife is always cold, seems like a neat idea and might get us camping together more often!\" \n\"We are avid campers in the Rockies and this fit multiple needs including a space saver bag and a small heated blanket. I also love inventive ideas in the camping communities.\" \n \"I like the idea a lot. Using something that everyone already uses (stuff sack for sleeping bag) is a really smart idea. \"\n\"I spend a lot of time in the backcountry in the winter and think that this is an outstanding safety device! The ability to warm an injured skier would be invaluable!\" \nFounder/CEO Richard Rhett, discusses current prototypes and shows off the Small Hot Pocket. Though only a Single Panel prototype it jumped 20\u00b0 F very quickly! The Double Radiant Heat Panels are obviously much faster, stay tuned for an update!  \nWorking Prototype\nPLAY\n\n Tech Features\nSize Specifications \nReward Options  \n Add on Options\n Timeline\nThis project is promoted by Jellop, a direct\u00ad response online advertising agency specializing in Kickstarter campaigns on Facebook Ads and Google AdWords.\nThese guys rock. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our sixth Kickstarter campaign, we've learned a lot throughout our last five campaigns - not to mention the last 9 years of business ;). We like to think that we're getting better and better at what we do. As with tackling anything new, we know there will be challenges along the way, we know there will be set backs, but rest assured we never slow down - not even a little. We're 115% pedal to the metal kinda company that doesn't take no for an answer.\n\nThere are a few items that could challenge us and our time line.\n1) Battery design, this will be a new endeavor for us. We will be opening a mold and creating an electronically controlled battery bank - which we are crazy excited about. That said this is a brand new field for us and we are hedging our risk by partnering with a Best in Industry portable battery bank manufacturer (they build for Goal Zero). We know there will be many unforeseen challenges when we move to final production, but we're brave and ready to face them! \n2) Fabric, this is the second longest lead item in our supply chain and if the produced fabric does not meet our high quality control specifications it will have to be redone. This could cause an unforeseen delay. \n3) Shipping around the world always presents risk, we source from several suppliers around the world and our logistics web is quite complex - so there's always potential for crazy unexpected delays at home or abroad. PLEASE NOTE, ALL CUSTOMS / DUTIES IN YOUR COUNTRY ARE YOUR RESPONSIBILITY - THIS IS OUT OF OUR HANDS. Sometimes international shipments experience unforeseen delays that are out of our control. \n4) If we add-on any new products during this campaign, we could experience delays. \n5) If we receive a monstrosity of backers (awesome) we could experience a slight delay, however we do feel confident in our supply chain and it's scalability.\n\nWe are partnered with \"Best in Industry\" suppliers and manufacturers that not only represent high quality products but they also mirror our values as a company in 'better than fair' labor and excellent employee conditions. We put boots on the ground in all of the facilities we work with, inspecting the entire process of our products - ensuring most importantly that people are treated with respect, dignity, and fairness.\n\nPlease note that we are a small company and we are dependent on several other companies staying in business and doing their job well - so with the launch of new products we sure do appreciate your patience! Our policy is honesty, transparency, and customer service in every aspect of our business. You make this happen and we will do everything we can to exceed your expectations, serve you, and equip you for adventure!

Thankfully he was able to completely re-arrange his production schedule to accommodate the completion of the Hot Pocket product in July!

The first time we planned this out George executed 10,000 Hot Pockets all the way to the final step, only lacking the heat panel, this was back in October of 2019. Then we ran into the brick wall of having to completely start over on the heat panel due to a poor performing supplier. He had to completely stop his production line because of this issue.

With incredible support from the community, the project raised $196,560 with 2272 backers! \nAfter years of testing and feedback from the community, we're back to solve the biggest problem in timeboxing today: interruptions.\nWhen you get interrupted mid-sprint, you can now stop time. \na new superpower, just for you\n\"Got my Esington today and I am ecstatic! I can't believe how great you handled everything. I am really impressed and grateful for putting this great idea out to the public... I just can't wait to change my life and discipline myself a step at a time to accomplish what I've always wanted to do.\" - Vanessa C, backer of the original Esington glass. \n$100,000 free acoustic base has been unlocked!\nEsington 2.0\nDid you know the average worker gets interrupted after only 11 minutes of work? The crazy thing is it takes 25 minutes to get re-focused on the job. \ninterruptions suck\nWith Esington 2.0, the magnetic time-stopper will keep your place in the sprint and act like a bookmark for your brain, waiting to be unleashed to restart your work.\nControl Time\nWe invented a new way to control the time on your glass. Simply place the magnetic stopper over the neck of the glass and the timer stops!\na cool new magic trick - stop the flow of iron nanospheres with the silicone magnet\nThe magnetic stopper interrupts the flow of the solid iron nanospheres and keeps your place during your timeboxing sprint. \nAbout the Glass\nEach glass is hand-blown borosilicate glass\nFor Esington 2.0, we are using borosilicate glass (like pyrex). Borosilicate glass is a type of glass that contains boron trioxide which allows for a very low coefficient of thermal expansion. This means it will not crack under extreme temperature changes like regular glass. It's a standard 25 minute timer designed for the Esington timeboxing method (similar to the pomodoro method with a few cue differences). \n4 million solid Iron nanospheres - more than 1 kilogram in each glass\nFor the timing medium, we are using solid Iron nanospheres. These work perfectly with the magnetic stopper since they are highly attracted to the embedded magnet. \nThe most beautiful productivity timer ever made\nThe solid Iron nanospheres flow freely, even after thousands of magnetic stops. \nWhite Noise\nMillions of solid iron nanospheres produce a soothing white noise for the first 20 seconds to act as a cue to start your work habit (more on this below).  Here's what it sounds like on different surfaces:  \nPLAY\n\nIf we reach $100,000, we will also be including a ring that enhances the white noise effect:\nPLAY\n\nMagnetic Silicone Stopper\nThe silicone stopper is designed to have a unique feeling and a satisfying soft \"click\" into place to stop the timer. This will make it easy to engrain the \"bookmark for your brain\", and bring you back exactly to where you left off your work when you're ready to resume.\nAn elegant addition to any executive desk\nWhile the stopper is in place, your brain senses incompletion and will subtly pull you back to your work. You will get a satisfying reward when you pull out the stopper and unlock the timer.\nWe tested the prototypes thousands of stops and they work perfectly every time.\nThe Esington Method\nThe Esington Method is a timeboxing technique that is similar to the popular pomodoro method, but with a few important cue differences.\nTurn off all distractions\nTurn over the glass to activate the 3 cues\nWork on a single task until your time runs out\nSoft Stop\nThe Esington timer has a \u201csoft stop\u201d.  There are no annoying bells or beeps to signal the end of your cycle.  \nThe timer runs out gracefully.\nSometimes, your focus can take you well beyond 25 minutes, and that\u2019s ok (especially if working on lower-energy tasks like answering emails).  You don\u2019t want to lose a valuable train of thought.  Just be sure to rest proportionally to the energy spent working.\nWhy You Need the Esington Glass\nIf you\u2019re not using a timeboxing system, this is the perfect way to start. The Esington Glass is simple, beautiful and is built to last. \nIf you\u2019re currently using a timeboxing system, you need to upgrade your timer.  Esington is beautiful, elegant and unique.  What does your current timer say about you?\nEsington 2.0 is the perfect gift for someone you care about.\nThe Design Process\nWe made a 3d mockup of the magnetic stopper and then hand-cut a sample out of silicone. \nAfter a few iterations, it worked perfectly with the iron nanospheres!\nWe used solid iron nanospheres to work better with the magnetic stopper. We also found the the solid iron nanospheres worked much better at flowing smoothly because of the smoothness and uniformity of the nanospheres.\nSpecifications\nThe Large glass is our executive edition: 40% larger and 3x bigger. The Large glass has louder white noise. Both are 25 minute timers. Borosilicate glass with 4 million iron nanospheres.\n\nTo show off your glass in an elegant way, we are including a free cork base with each glass. \nA cool cork base with each glass!\nTimeline and Expectations\nJuly: Early bird orders ship\nAugust: Regular bird orders ship\nWe have the prototypes ready and have lined up a primary and secondary manufacturer. We have 4 years of experience making these glasses so we are confident we can deliver on time. \nThe solid iron nanospheres have been tested thousands of times and we're also confident we can secure high quality material. We also have 4 years experience quality testing these glasses, so we're confident in getting you a great product in a timely fashion. \nFeedback from our first campaign\n\"I'm going to add to the growing list of glowing reviews.

", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe learned a lot from our first campaign over 4 years ago. In that campaign, the first manufacturing run was quick and efficient and provided a wonderful experience to about 1/3 of our backers. Unfortunately, we had delays for the 2nd and 3rd manufacturing runs which caused delays of up to several months for some unlucky backers. Since then, our manufacturing runs have become much larger and more efficient. Our QA process is refined and our logistics network has been built out in the last 4 years. We have employees overseeing every step of the process, rather than just Rudy handling everything :)\n\nThe iron nanospheres have been tested thousands of times and we're also confident we can secure high quality material. We also have 4 years experience quality testing these glasses, so we're confident in getting you a great product in a timely fashion.\n\nThe biggest risk is in an unexpectedly large and successful campaign, which could cause some delays if the manufacturing requirement is more than 20,000 glasses.

Automatic watering makes using OGarden Smart virtually effortless, and the automatic low energy consumption LEDs simulate the perfect amount of sunlight, offering optimal year round growth.\nEnjoy home grown produce whenever you need it. Be ready for simple, beautiful, and sustainable indoor gardening at its finest.\nPLAY\n\nMost indoor gardening systems lack the size and ability to grow a substantial amount of produce. Or they are difficult to set up, and leave even the most experienced gardener frustrated.\nBy being able to grow a great amount of veggies and fruits easily from your living room, OGarden Smart is a way to eat produce sustainably that\u2019s never been done before.  Effortless, easy and pleasant, the OGarden Smart easily upgrades your home and your grocery basket!\n\nNo more worrying about which seasons to grow your produce in. No matter the conditions outside, OGarden Smart will grow up to 90 fruits and veggies at once, with 20 different kinds to choose from. \nIs your favorite vegetable or fruit not on the list? No problem! With the Bag of Virgin Earth, you can sprout your own seeds. Have fun and grow your own original plants. We'd love to see what you grow! Take photos of your harvest and share them with the Ogarden Smart community.\n All you need to do is plant a seed, make sure there is enough water in the tank (only once a week), and you can harvest your produce 30 to 40 days later, that\u2019s it.\nThere are 90 available spots, so with a good rotation, you can have 2-4 large vegetables a day, every day. \nAlternatively, you can have a bouquet of various garnishes to top off any meal, any time.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, it costs a family of four an average of $850 per month for groceries*. OGarden Smart can save you up to 80% on your veggie expenses - allowing you to cut down your grocery bill.\n*Official USDA Food Plans: U.S. Average, November 2017\nWith OGarden, you can get fully grown, pesticide-free veggies for as low as $0.45 cents!\nOGarden is truly the best way to eat produce grown in a 100% organic environment at a fraction of the cost.\nAlso, you\u2019ll be eliminating food waste by being able to harvest food when you need it.\nBy producing your vegetables, fruits, and herbs directly at home, you know the quality of the air, the water and environment they grow in. Have peace of mind knowing that all of your fresh produce is grown in a 100% organic environment. \nOur seed pods are made with organic soil and feeds your plants with organic fertilizer, so you only get the best for your plants and for your body.\nAnd of course, harvesting your produce only moments before eating it almost guarantees a better tasting product.\n\nThe beauty of OGarden (aside from the way it looks) is how it\u2019s incredibly simple to use. Whether you\u2019re an expert gardener or new to your green thumb, OGarden is the perfect system to grow beautiful produce. Gardening has never been easier.\n\nOur unique system allows you to have 3 rotations of produce simultaneously. Germinate a batch of seeds, grow another batch to size, and have a third batch ready to harvest all at the same time!\nTake pride in your food by producing your own veggies at home, in a fully automatic way.\nOGarden Smart will automatically adjust watering for you to optimize growth. Just check your tank once a week and watch your garden grow.\nIf you do forget to check the water for a quick five minutes per week, don\u2019t worry. OGarden Smart has a water warning system that will alert you when the water level becomes too low over time.\nThe rotating wheel keeps the roots and soil constantly moist with just the right amount of water, while keeping the the plants growing in an even manner.\nOGarden Smart\u2019s LEDs simulate the perfect amount of sunlight that your produce needs to thrive, and will automatically turn on and off for convenience and energy conservation. \nBest of all, they only take 120 watts of power! In comparison, that\u2019s about 2 incandescent light bulbs.\nWhy is OGarden\u2019s growth so efficient? And why is it so easy?\nThe key is in the cup of seeds. Made with organic soil and fed with all the organic fertilizer it needs, our seed cups create the perfect environment for the plant to grow.\nThey\u2019re also super clean! No spilled dirt or fuss. With a 100% biodegradable membrane, the seed cups stay in place without any mess.\nThe OGarden Smart is so much more than a production machine - it\u2019s a garden, bringing joy and beauty into your home.\nWe gave it a clean minimalist design that not only compliments, but enhances any space. \nThe circular shape creates room for produce to grow larger and fuller while keeping small footprint in your living space. The cabinet underneath the wheel creates a perfect space to germinate your seeds. Grow a full garden indoors without using too much precious wall space, living space, or window light!\nPlus, the rotating wheel creates a beautiful, moving aesthetic that brings life to your home.\nOGarden teaches us how to grow our own food and gives us a better understanding of where our food comes from and how it affects us.\nWe see it as a way improve our health and quality of life through education and connection with food. \nWe made OGarden effortless to use because we want the concept of growing food to be easily past down for generations. With OGarden, parents can teach their children the importance of growing their own food and pass down the pride and health benefits that come along with it. \nEating healthy, fresh, and delicious foods will make an incredible difference in our lives. Growing our own food makes us mindful of what we\u2019re putting in our bodies and connects us closer with our planet and with each other.\nWith OGarden, we are working towards bringing more autonomy to people through a solution that can have a significant impact on ecology. Our mission is to bring our humanity to a new level, with more responsibility for ourselves and our planet.\nWe are committed to creating true sustainable solutions that positively affect our world and our lives. Join us. Bring your life to a new level and let\u2019s change the world together. \n\n\n\nOgarden Smart production run\nWe created the OGarden Smart to work towards a better, healthier, ecological and responsible world. Our mission, through the OGarden, is to create a real positive ecological impact on Earth, while bringing more autonomy to individuals.\nWe decided to work on a solution that could bring us fresh and healthy food for cheaper than the store and as well creating a great and positive impact on Earth. We felt it would be our contribution to the improvement of Earth and humanity.\nHow can we get fresh, healthy, non-gmo vegetables, for cheaper than the store? That was THE question. We looked into other hydroponic solutions, but they only allowed us to grow a few herbs in the kitchen and did not really made a difference in our food expense. Everything we grew was gone in 1 to 2 meals.\nSo we started developing our own system that would make a REAL difference in our plate and food budget, and the OGarden was born. We created a super optimized device that grows up to 90 veggies, fruits, and herbs at the same time for about 5 times less expensive than in grocery store. \nSustainable, autonomous, and affordable - welcome to the future of gardening!\nOGarden is a young company based in Quebec, Canada. It was founded in 2016 after our first highly successful crowdfunding campaign. Lead by the vision of a more beautiful world that is ecologically closer to nature, the OGarden team has worked hard to find an innovative solution. We believe we've found it.

One of the most important items is about shipping so we'd like to highlight it here also.\nOur patented BR48 weighs just over 15 oz which is the maximum for first-class mail in the US. As a result, we have to use Priority Mail which is more expensive. We build for quality, not profit, because we know you'll use the BR48 for many many years. We want you to know that we only charge actual shipping costs to the best of our ability, and even less in some cases to bring down the overall costs. For international orders, we've been shipping worldwide for four years now and have a good handle on the actual costs.\nFinally, we would love to talk about plantar fasciitis, tendinitis, tennis elbow or epicondylitis, sciatica, disc herniation and all sorts of pain inducing conditions that respond well to myofascial release. The BR48 is a back roller sure, but technically it is a myofascial release tool. Myofascial release is a great modality for interrupting the vicious cycle of pain caused by these medical conditions. But, any device that is marketed as a cure for a medical condition is automatically considered to be a medical device by the US FDA. \nThe FDA then charges all 'medical device manufacturers' for this privilege and it is very very expensive. We were FDA registered for our first three years in business and as such, our lacrosse balls were 'FDA medical devices'.\nThis nonsense was breaking us financially and so now we are careful not to market our tools for any medical conditions and are no longer FDA registered. Of course, our lacrosse balls and other myofascial release tools are the same tools they always were and just as effective.\nHow is it that myofascial release can be effective when your source of pain is a medical condition like sciatica or herniated disc? It's simple really, your body tightens in surrounding areas in response to pain and that tightness causes more pain - that's the vicious cycle mentioned above. And that's why you get relief from interrupting it.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our 3rd Kickstarter project since 2014. We've gotten much better at setting accurate expectations and delivering on our promises. The key factor here is that it takes about six months from the time you pay for a plastic injection mold to the time your production run is delivered and most Kickstarter creators put the money down for the mold after the project ends. To accelerate delivery, we've borrowed the money to pay for the BR48 mold and it has already been completed.\n\nBut no matter how much we plan ahead, things can still go astray. If they do, we promise to give you full transparency into the issues and solve them in a way that leaves you proud to support our company.\n\nSupply Chain Risk: Sometimes a machine or tool breaks. Sometimes a factory loses power for a day. These things happen from time to time and can affect how long it takes to build our products.\n\nShipping Risk: Global shipping and warehousing is a difficult business so we outsource it to experts.

That's cool too.  \nWe try to come up with stuff that makes a huge difference in global problems that you can do in your home or your backyard.  Without sacrifice.   We only share those things that will add luxury and coin to your life.   \nbuild good things rather than being angry at bad guys\nToday we are creating a two hour long video about how to build a Rocket Oven.  This design is for indoor use although we show versions that have been modified to be weather resistant.  A Rocket Oven will do all of your baking without the environmental disaster associated with natural gas or electric ovens.  For those of you living or considering off grid, this uses fuel that is plentiful and readily found - as opposed to off-grid's dirty little grid secret: \"propane\".  As an added bonus, the environmental impact is far smaller than any other type of oven.\nRocket Ovens use the same \"engine\" as a rocket mass heater.  An  insulated j-tube that pushes the burn temp so high that the smoke and creosote from a fire is also used as fuel.  The exhaust is very clean and the heat is hyper focused on the task at hand.  The designs in this video are \"white oven\" designs - the exhaust does not mingle with the food.\nHere is my grand and especially well thought out budget to pull this project off.   Presented as a high quality pie chart that I made myself.\nit must be right because it is in a pie chart\nWE ARE FUNDED IN 18 HOURS!\nGurk?  I guess all that worry about getting funded at all was just silliness!  So, quick!  We need some stretch goals!\nmmmmm ... stretchy ....\nDan comes to my place and makes a video about the progress of the project and the stretch goals!\nRewards: THANKS\nIn some of my past kickstarters, we offered neat stuff at the $1 level. Usually in the form of a \"microdoc\" or \"micro documentary\". A full sized documentary is typically two hours. These tended to be 15 to 45 minutes long. With this kickstarter we are going to create TWO microdocs. Mostly because we couldn't get all of the important content to fit on one DVD:\nRocket Ovens Cooking: Watch as lots of different things are baked and roasted. Hear about how it is a little different from using a natural gas or electric oven.\nRocket Ovens Tools, Materials and Safety: The final build in the DVD is done without welding and we worked to keep the tools and materials simple and low cost. High temp materials can be a bit odd.\nAnd we are adding two microdocs from previous kickstarters:\nHugelkultur: The microdoc from the kickstarter for the 3-DVD set \"World Domination Gardening\"\nCare and Feeding of a Rocket Mass Heater: The microdoc from the kickstarter \"Better Wood Heat: DIY Rocket Mass Heaters.\"\nfrom the hugelkultur microdoc\nAs a bonus for everybody that supports this kickstarter:\nJustin Rhodes at Basecamp: I have two properties relatively close to each other. When Justin Rhodes stopped by on his Great American Farm tour, we had so much stuff here, he only had time to video one of the two. The one we call \"basecamp\". Justin showed 22 minutes of pieces on youtube and 45 minutes privately to his supporters.  Now all kickstarter supporters get to see the bonus stuff too!\nPublic Thanks: I've seen some other kickstarters do this and I think we do it much, much better. They post your name to a facebook page where it is lost and forgotten within a couple days. We post it to our thread at permies.com where we have perennial discussions. Thousands of people will actually look at the list for years to come. And, naturally, we will give you a chance to be as creative and as silly as you want. While some people will post their names, or their kids, or maybe plug their business, you can also divulge your plans for world domination and give yourself all the galactic titles you want. Check out the thanks page from our last kickstarter and the one before that.\n(this is the public Justin Rhodes video)\nRewards: CANDY\nFire Science DVD: Science is what makes the j-tube core of the rocket oven (and rocket mass heaters) so amazing. We start with science and the simplify the design about a hundred times as the decades pass and end up with what you see in the Rocket Ovens DVD. The Fire Science DVD is a full length workshop introduction to the bits and bobs that make all this work so amazingly well! This is one of four DVDs from my Wood Burning Stoves 2.0 kickstarter.\nPermaculture Playing Cards as an ebook: My third kickstarter was the permaculture playing cards. There's so many details on every card that it takes about an hour and a half to read them all.\nAccess to the permies.com \"Secret Inner Circle\" forum: Join our past kickstarter supporters in a place where you can talk about stuff without the prying eyes of google or \"them\".\n5-hour tour of Wheaton Labs: This was a stretch goal for my last kickstarter - to video \"all the things\". Turns out that this task takes five hours!\npermaculture playing cards\nRewards: GLORY\nYour most creative name listed in both of the two new microdocs. Feel free to use any wacky name you like. We tend to show all the names across the top of the video as it plays, but who knows what we might come up with this time!\nBuilding a Cob Style Rocket Mass Heater DVD: This shows the full build of a rocket mass heater in a log structure and another full build of a rocket mass heater in a tipi. This is the crown jewel from my kickstarter \"Better Wood Heat: DIY Rocket Mass Heaters\"\nWild Edibles DVD and 10 ebooks: This is the result of a kickstarter I did with Sergei Boutenko on his kickstarter channel. You can see my name in the credits as \"Supreme Executive Producer with Pickles, Ketchup and Sparkles\"!\nBuilding a Cob Style Rocket Mass Heater DVD\nWild Edibles DVD and 10 ebooks\nRewards: GLORYGLORY\nYour most creative name in the trailing credits of the Rocket Ovens DVD: We will create a section in the trailing credits that says \"These People Paid Actual Money to See Their Name Here ...\" Here's the trailer from one of the DVDs from \"Better Wood Heat\" that shows what we did. We actually did different silly things for each DVD.\n REWARDS: RMH and FULL-ROCKET\nThis new Rocket Ovens DVD is a sort of follow up to the previous 8 DVDs about rocket mass heaters.   The \"RMH\" reward includes the more recent four DVDs from \"Better Wood Heat\" and \"FULL-ROCKET\" includes the complete 8 DVDs inluding \"Wood Burning Stoves 2.0\".  All in HD streaming (not physical DVDs).\nbetter wood heat on the left and wood burning stoves 2 on the right\n REWARDS: ATC and PDC\nMy last kickstarter was about videoing the Appropriate Technology Course (ATC) and the Permaculture Design Course (PDC).   Both were taught by Tim Barker, the creator of the Rocket Oven.  And the ATC video is what is used in parts of the Rocket Ovens DVD.  The 100 hours of PDC video and 77 hours of ATC video will be in HD Streaming.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIn a past kickstarter, the video editor quit right after the kickstarter finished. So this time, the video editor (Dan Ohmann) has done 95% of the editing before the kickstarter started. \n\nA lot of kickstarters want to get funding before the person doing the kickstarter has done much of anything. Before they have any skin in the game. This project has had years of recording and six months in editing and recording bits and bobs to round out the video. We have brought this project as far as we can before getting the printing and paying for music and a few other bits and bobs. We are ready to wrap up. There have been about a dozen challenges and I think those are behind us.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more",

We\u2019re all setting ourselves up for failure in the posture department. For one, we sit hunched over our computers or phones all day long, a very unnatural position for the human body. Then, we go home and sleep on a pillow that only makes things worse by pushing our heads forward for 8 hours a night. It\u2019s no wonder we all have bad posture, back pain, and stiff necks. Other posture pillows have tried to help correct this, but they\u2019re uncomfortable, making it hard to do what you actually need to do on them: SLEEP.\n\nAnd that's why we created the True Pillow. It's the only posture pillow that\u2019s designed with your comfort and posture in mind so you can wake up refreshed; ready to take on the day. \nTrue Pillow comfortably supports your head, neck, and back while improving your posture thanks to its patent-pending design. It's unique shape fixes forward head posture by restoring the curve in your cervical spine while lightly stretching your neck muscles to their natural state.\n\nTrue Pillow\u2019s long wedge was strategically designed to keep your chest up while keeping your shoulders down to the mattress. This restores your overly-rounded upper back curve while fixing rounded shoulders. Sleep on True Pillow for just 30 nights to look and feel more confident than ever before.\n\nEliminate irritating tension in your neck and upper back that you thought were just \u201cpart of life\u201d. True Pillow doesn\u2019t discriminate when it comes to sleeping position either. You can sleep comfortably on your back or your side.\n\nYou might even find you\u2019re getting a lot more dates thanks to True Pillow (ladies love a man with good posture). \nTrue Pillow is made of 100% memory foam, a material designed to give comfortable support. It comes with a fitted, washable white or black zip cover.\nPLAY\n\n                                     An unnatural neck curve damages your discs and vertebra which will cause a lifetime of neck pain and headaches. And nobody wants to walk around with an embarrassing Dowager's Hump (\"Granny Hump\"). \nTestimonials\n\"At first I was skeptical of the True Pillow, but after sleeping on it for a night, I couldn't believe how natural it felt to walk with your chest out and shoulders back the next day.\" - Mark\n\n\"I used to have really bad neck pain and couldn't find a solution. Artem let me try the True Pillow to see if it would help. And to my surprise; the neck pain went away after a first night's sleep. I still sleep on the True Pillow daily and the pain hasn't returned.\" - Mike\n                                 True Pillow Sizes\nLarge - 6\" tall x 28\" width - 20\" length with wedge\nAverage - 5\" tall x 28\" width - 18\" length with wedge\nSmall - 4\" tall x 26\" width - 16\" length with wedge\n \nReturn Policy\nIf you aren't fully satisfied with True Pillow, return it to us within 30 days of receiving it for a full refund. Buyer responsible to pay for return shipping.\nArtem Cheban\nMarketing/Branding\n\nAndrey Andriyk\nProduct Design\n\nIgor Cheban\nIllustrator/Artwork \nDaniel Vataman\nPhotography/Video\n\nMusic: www.bensound.com\nQ: What is the difference between Therapeutica and True Pillow?\nA: Although these two pillows look similar, there is a very important design difference in the True Pillow... the longer wedge. This wedge is extremely important to have as it lifts up your chest during the night which evens out your overly rounded back and helps fix rounded shoulders.\n\nQ: Can I purchase extra pillow covers?\nA: Yes, you will be able to add additional pillow covers of any color at $15 a piece when the funding is over.\n\n\nFix Your Posture While You Sleep - True Pillow\nGet Your Project Funded Today!\n    Try This\nGet Cash Back on the Projects You Love!\n  https://www.braceability.com/blog/5-things-you-didnt-realize-you-needed-good-posture-for/\nhttps://www.100percentchiropractic.com/long-term-effects-of-poor-posture/\n    ", "risks": "", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 69 or more", "title": "1 x True Pillow | KICKSTARTER SPECIAL", "descp": "Save 30% OFF Est Retail Price of $99\nChoose Color in Survey After Successful Funding\nINCLUDES:\nTrue Pillow\n15-Min Stretch Guide (Digital Delivery)", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jul 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["1,751 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 138 or more", "title": "2 x True Pillow | KICKSTARTER SPECIAL", "descp": "Save 30% OFF Est Retail Price of $198\nChoose Color in Survey After Successful Funding\nINCLUDES:\n2\u00d7 True Pillow\n15-Min Stretch Guide (Digital Delivery)", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jul 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["335 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 236 or more", "title": "4 x True Pillow | FAMILY PACK", "descp": "Save 40% OFF Est Retail Price of $198\nChoose Color in Survey After Successful Funding\nINCLUDES:\n4\u00d7 True Pillow\n15-Min Stretch Guide (Digital Delivery)", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jul 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["41 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 49 or more", "title": "1 x True Pillow | SUPER EARLY BIRD", "descp": "ONLY AVAILABLE FOR FIRST 24 HOURS\n* FREE SHIPPING IN UNITED STATES *\nSave 50% OFF Est Retail Price of $99\nChoose Color in Survey After Successful Funding\nINCLUDES:\nTrue Pillow\n15-Min Stretch Guide (Digital Delivery)", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jul 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["Reward no longer available", "279 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 59 or more", "title": "1 x True Pillow | EARLY BIRD", "descp": "Save 40% OFF Est Retail Price of $99\nChoose Color in Survey After Successful Funding\nINCLUDES:\nTrue Pillow\n15-Min Stretch Guide (Digital Delivery)", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jul 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["Reward no longer available", "250 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 98 or more", "title": "2 x True Pillow | SUPER EARLY BIRD", "descp": "ONLY AVAILABLE FOR FIRST 24 HOURS\n* FREE SHIPPING IN UNITED STATES *\nSave 50% OFF Est Retail Price of $198\nChoose Color in Survey After Successful Funding\nINCLUDES:\n2\u00d7 True Pillow\n15-Min Stretch Guide (Digital Delivery)", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jul 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["Reward no longer available", "45 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 118 or more", "title": "2 x True Pillow | EARLY BIRD", "descp": "Save 40% OFF Est Retail Price of $198\nChoose Color in Survey After Successful Funding\nINCLUDES:\n2\u00d7 True Pillow\n15-Min Stretch Guide (Digital Delivery)", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jul 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["Reward no longer available", "100 backers"]}], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #49", "update_userinfo": "Full Refunds to Backers Who Did Not Receive Their Rewards", "update_content": "Dear backers,\nUnfortunately, the marketing deal has fell through and will not be happening, but we are still refunding backers who have not gotten their rewards.\nPlease note that it is important that you email us at support@spineperfect.com if you want a refund with your backer ID.

By helping us fund our Kickstarter, you're helping us bring this ancient magical seagreen to the world today. \nIntroducing Kelp Jerky\nKelp Jerky - Your New Favorite Snack\nEver found yourself looking for a high-protein snack? One without loads of sugar? And one that's plant-based? It's not easy! But we've got you!\nRichard Branson approved.\nAfter a year of R&D, we\u2019re ready to launch our first product, Kelp Jerky to the world - a delicious, savory, vegan jerky in 3 flavors made with kelp, mushrooms, and superfoods - the only high-protein, high-fiber, plant-based snack on the market that\u2019s free from refined sugar, soy, and gluten. If you back us at any level at $20 and above, you'll be getting our brand new Kelp Jerky in the mail this spring and summer before anyone else in the world!\nOur Kelp Jerky is packed with outrageously delicious flavors like our sea salt & sesame with hints of nori, our \"High Thai'd\" with turmeric and coconut, and our rosemary BBQ with a touch of maple, all layered on top of hints of umami mushroom and mineral-rich sugar kelp. Want to create your own flavor of Kelp Jerky? We've got a reward tier for that! We're super excited about creating new flavors with you!\nSea Salt & Sesame\nTurmeric Thai & Coconut\nRosemary Maple & BBQ\nPut down the soy sticks and skip the protein bars with 10g of sugar. We've got you covered. Whether you're gearing up for a triathlon or just getting hangry on a road trip, with 8g of protein and less than 1g of made-in-the-USA organic maple tree sugar, Kelp Jerky, is going to be your new favorite snack. To date, we've received rave reviews!\nKelp Jerky in the Media\nRecyclable Packaging Hitting the Shelves this Year!\n Kelp for Your Health \nWe use Sugar Kelp (Saccharina latissima) (don't let the name freak you out - it has just 0.6g of natural plant sugars per 100g). It's also known as Sweet Kelp, Kombu Royale, Sea Belt, and Poor Man's Weather Glass. It's a delicate, delicious, and edible brown macroalgae. \nKelp is full of vitamins, minerals, phytonutrients, amino acids, omega-3 fats and fiber, including zinc, magnesium, iron, potassium, copper, and calcium (10x more than milk!). \nKelp supports your body\u2019s ability to absorb water and is a rich, natural source of iodine that helps to stimulate a healthy metabolism. \nKelp is also one of the only foods that expands in your stomach, making you feel fuller, longer. \nA Nutritious Blade of Sugar Kelp\nKelp for the Planet's Health\nWe use ocean-farmed kelp, which is a zero-input crop, which requires no fresh water, fertilizer, or dry land on which to grow. We never wild-harvest kelp, which is detrimental to our ocean's ecosystems. Our kelp is sourced from our network of New England ocean farms, which function as storm-surge protectors and shoreline ecosystems for 150+ species. And did you know that seaweed soaks up 5x more carbon from the water than land based plants do from the air?\nThe benefits of kelp for both the human body as well as the long-term health of the planet are incredible. It is truly a food for a better future.\nHelp us Grow\nWe're a small, lean team on a big mission, which is why we're raising $25,000 in funds on Kickstarter today. \nThe funds will help support our first fully scaled production run so we can move out of our little East Village kitchen. \nThey will also go towards the purchase of recyclable packaging for our Kelp Jerky (which costs twice as much as regular packaging!)\nAnd the funds will support our online shop so we can sell internationally to you from day one!\nStretch goals: If we can go past $25,000 in funding, this means we add fun bonuses for our early backers before our launch this summer, sell in more stores across the country from day one, and support more farmers in the New England area to grow more Kelp for more Kelp Jerky! \nToday, the global plant-based meat market is projected to reach $5.2 billion by 2020. Projections include seaweeds accounting for at least 15% of that -- $750 million in the next 2 years. We want to go bigger but we need your help!\nBeyond Kelp Jerky, our future products will include kelp burgers, kelp sausages, kelp broth, kelp noodles, kelp dressings, and more. We want to grow AKUA into a household name for seagreens based products for decades to come. \nCBM, Co-Founder, CO-CEO/CMO\nWe hope you'll join our community of supporters as we explore the boundless potential of the ocean\u2019s seagreens that lie just beyond every shoreline in the world.\nIt\u2019s not always easy making the world a better place. But with your help and our kelp\u2026 we can do it together! #kelpjerkyiscoming! \nYour Rewards!\nWe will be thanking you via email and publicly but we also want you to have awesome rewards!

And who is J.R. \"Bob\" Dobbs? And why is his name always in quotes? And for nonbelievers, why has this strangely compelling parody religion, this long-running postmodern joke, caught the attention of such pop culture icons as Rachel Maddow, Nick Offerman, Jon Stewart, David Letterman, Pee-wee Herman (Paul Reubens), David Byrne, Robert Crumb, Richard Linklater, Alex Cox, Ken Kesey, Frank Zappa, Jonathan Demme, and Devo\u2019s Mark Mothersbaugh? And is it true that Tori Amos is also one of \"Bob\"\u2019s chosen?  \n\"Bob\" and the Church have caught the attention of many\u2013 include David Byrne, Pee-wee Herman (Paul Reubens), Tori Amos, Stephen Colbert, Robert Crumb, Mark Mothersbaugh and DEVO, Matt Groening, Margaret Moser, Rachel Maddow, Nick Offerman, and more.\nARE WE CONTROLLED BY SECRET FORCES? ARE ALIEN MONSTERS BRINGING A STARTLING NEW WORLD? DO PEOPLE THINK YOU\u2019RE STRANGE? DO YOU? \nThe Church of the SubGenius: The Early Years\n\u201cWe tied together every occult, superstitious fringe belief you could think of\u2026it was so much fun!\u201d\n\u2013 Ivan Stang, co-founder\nBorn into the suburban world of the 1950s, future founders of the Church of the SubGenius Reverend Ivan Stang (Douglass St. Clair Smith) and Dr. Philo Drummond (Steve Wilcox) come of age during the 1960s and 70s \u2013 a time of unprecedented social and political tumult. They experience the rise of a deafening consumer culture, the tarnishing of the \"American Dream,\" the violence of the Vietnam War abroad, and the Kennedy assassinations and conspiracies that follow. \nAs youths they revel in the delights of stable families, monster movies, Science Fiction, super-8 moviemaking, dinosaur figures, comic books, and Rock 'n' Roll. As they grow older they witness the emergence of televangelism, the Jonestown Massacre, punk culture, and Reaganomics.\nDespite both growing up in Texas, it was not until the mid 70s that Stang and Drummond meet and quickly forge a friendship over a shared love of comic books, Captain Beefheart, and UFO paperbacks. One not so particular eve in 1977, while bemoaning their lack of conventional \u201csuccess\u201d for two such intelligent, well read chaps, Stang remarks, \u201cWell, we\u2019re not exactly geniuses.\u201d To which Drummond replies, \u201cyeah, we\u2019re sub-geniuses.\u201d \nAnd in that moment the Church of the SubGenius is born. It is not long after that J.R. \"Bob\" Dobbs reveals himself as the Church's iconic prophet and foremost patron of ineffable Slack. In fact, Stang and Drummond will later come to the realization that \"Bob\" has been planting evidence of his presence for them for the past twenty years!!!\nTHE SUBGENIUS DIASPORA\n\u201cThere was that moment of realizing that this thing goes further than I ever imagined.\u201d\n\u2013 Puzzling Evidence (Doug Wellman)\nIn late 1979 Stang and Drummond, with the help of their wives, brainstorm what would become perhaps the single most significant marketing effort made at the inception of the Church of the SubGenius \u2013 the writing, design, printing, and distribution of Pamphlet #1. The doctrine of the Church quickly spreads, and the word of \u201cBob\u201d and the teachings of JHVH-1 teach \u201ctime control\u201d as a way to wrest \u201cSlack\u201d from the \u2018Pinks\u2019 and \u2018Normals.\u2019 The Church, it seems, has struck a nerve amidst the deadening consumer culture, the evisceration of basic social services, and the worship of wealth that occurred during the Reagan/Thatcher years.\nL: An early years Devival | R: The Three Wise Guys \u2013 Ivan Stang, Dr.X and Philo Drummond \u2013 pose with a Model X Humanoid (1979)\nAs \u201cBob\u201d\u2019s pamphlet continues to travel the world, the emergent punk publishing scene and new wave comic writers seize on the humor and cultural critique of the Church's doctrine. In San Francisco it is fished out of a trashcan by cartoonist and artist Paul Mavrides, igniting a SubGenius cell that gives the movement some of its most enduring art and performances through LIES (Paul Mavrides), Dr. Howland Owl (Hal Robins), Puzzling Evidence (Doug Wellman), Janor Hypercleats and Pope Sternodox. \n\"Bob\" captures the zetigeist of the day. Cartoonist Robert Crumb reprints Pamphlet #1 in the first issue of his comic Weirdo. A few years later Simon and Schuster publishes The Book of the SubGenius.  Acclaimed film director and SubGenius Alex Cox channels Church mythology in Repo Man as the glowing, alien-owned Chevy Malibu soars high above Los Angeles with Otto (Emilio Estevez) and Miller (Tracy Walke) inside, their faces shining with Slack as Bud (Harry Dean Stanton) watches from below. \nDr. Howl and Puzzling Evidence conduct legendary \u201cDevivals,\u201d radio shows (More than an Hour, Less than a Show), and introduce the word of \"Bob\" to Burning Man. The Stark Fist of Removal newsletter, The Hour of Slack podcast, an MTV special, and countless cassette tapes, posters, comics, videos, websites, and Facebook groups perpetuate the word of \"Bob.\" \nBy the turn of the century, publications as powerful as TIME Magazine begin to get the SubGenius joke when \u201cBob\u201d is voted \u2018Fraud of the Century\u201d by readers of its online poll. In the late 90\u2019s and early 2000\u2019s, the \u201cFree Party\u201d constituents of Brighton in Great Britain voted \u201cBob\u201d Dobbs as an M.P. to the House of Commons three times.\nToday, \u201cBob\u201d\u2019s hucksterism and the wisdom of JHVH-1 is apparent in all fifty states and a multitude of countries across the globe!\nPLAY\n\nAnother early SubGenius of Texas, David Boone (late husband of Slacking Towards Bethlehem director Sandy K. Boone), documents the rise of the SubGenius in his 1980 film, Invasion of the Aluminum People, which is lauded by Academy Award winning director Jonathan Demme. This is one of the first known recorded instances of the transmission of SLACK.\nGIVE TO THIS KICKSTARTER NOW AND ACHIEVE SALVATION \u2013 OR TRIPLE YOUR MONEY BACK!!!!!!\nOnly with your support can our intrepid group of award-winning filmmakers dare to make this film. By giving us your hard earned cash, we can make this dream a reality, and breach all Earthly human, political, and cultural barriers with the searing nonhuman truth of the Word of \"Bob,\" J.R. \"Bob\" Dobbs, that LIVING GOD WHO WALKS THIS PLANET EARTH IN HUCKSTER'S SHOES. \nTo date, we\u2019ve travelled over 8,000 miles and interviewed 15 SubGenius in four cities, sharing the so-called \"reality\" that SubGenii are forced to share with humans. We\u2019ve only just begun to uncover many of the SubGenius\u2019 most guarded secrets. The SubGenii are finally willing to go public and tell the TRUTH. \nThis is YOUR chance to get in on the ground floor of a huge, globally important cult. You will then attract all the $$$, pleasure spacecraft, and SHEER POWER OVER OTHERS that go with high-ranking support of the Church and this documentary! \nBut most important, you can smite your enemies, achieve TIME CONTROL and attain SLACK.\nREMEMBERING SAINT MARGARET\nSince we began production on our film, a beloved avatar of the early SubGenius tribe, Margaret Moser, passed away on August 25 of this year. One of the nation\u2019s top music journalists and music scene nurturers, Reverend Reverend Doctor Doctor Archdoctor Saint Margaret Moser even had a photo of J.R. \u201cBob\u201d Dobbs on her Austin Chronicle business card. She said it helped her connect with her interview subjects, many of whom were already members of the Church themselves.\nPLAY\n\nIn her interview with us, she spoke about the pleasure, \u201cthe great release, to have all this nutty stuff in your head and find like minded people to express it with.\u201d But most notably she sang a song written by her own hand, \"Oh, Life's a Bowl of Cherries with \"Bob\" Dobbs.\" Saint Moser's life epitomized the way that membership in the Church accelerated the discovery of true friendships, experimentations, creative collisions, and rebellion through art, music, and comedy against dehumanization in any form.\nWHY THIS FILM? \nWhy not this film? Pull the wool over your own eyes and help us make a movie! The Church of the SubGenius is the underground movement that has galvanized the imaginative, the artistic, the nerdy, even the deranged \u2013 to examine the simmering dystopia in their culture, and do absolutely nothing about it... except, maybe, poke fun at it all. The Church of the SubGenius is taking over the universe. The sooner you learn about it, the better off you\u2019ll be. \nPLAY\n\nNow more than ever we feel that the story of the Church of the SubGenius needs to be told. There's a core of ideas within the SubGenius ethos \u2013 of fighting oppression with humor, community and creativity, of using absurdity as a nonviolent weapon, giving time, permission and priority to expression, creation, and zaniness with friends \u2013  that we think has great value we believe these ideas are necessary in today's world and that our film about the SubGenius is the perfect way to invoke them.\nAmongst all the spaceships, frop, pipes, eye-bludgeoning graphics, bulldada, yeti ancestors, (and yes, \u2018macho spoutings\u2019), we hope you will fund this film so you can join our merry band of pranksters on the culture-jam of the century!

This time, more colorful than ever!\n $100k Stretch Goal Just Unlocked - KLOS GLOW-IN-THE-DARK carbon fiber guitar - limited edition Kickstarter model (20 available)\n   This guitar appears black in the daylight, but at night glows neon green in the dark \n             ATTENTION INTERNATIONAL CUSTOMERS\nWe\u2019ve learned from previous campaigns - most of the value of the guitar will be written off as research and development as well as a donation to the campaign for the sake of the company growing. For this reason, the declared value of the guitar for customs will be near zero, making the cost of customs negligible for the customer. Please reach out to us with any further questions.\nListen to some of our brand ambassadors play their KLOS guitars and hear how good carbon fiber sounds!\n            The KLOS Guitar at 20, 310 ft - Summit of Denali\n         We protect the body, the sound producing part of the guitar, by making it out of carbon fiber. We make the neck from mahogany wood, giving it a familiar feel and keeping it affordable.\nCarbon fiber is an infusion of the most durable fibers and the strongest resin. It is commonly seen in aerospace, automotive, and sporting goods engineering.\n                  This guitar is an incredibly multifunctional instrument. It's perfect for travelers, ranging from college students, hikers, to business men and women. Children and beginners also will find the guitar incredibly comfortable to learn on because of its compact size. Moreover you don't compromise the quality of the sound by buying a slightly smaller than parlor size guitar (see our customer reviews and demos below). Just like beginners can become experts, and children become travelers with age, the KLOS guitar serves as a sturdy companion in each case.\n  We designed the colors to be absolutely stunning. Each color features a combination of the black and colored carbon fiber weave. Together, the black and colored weave produces a very sleek look, amazing sound, durable and resistant material, as well as a comfortable and portable size. \n                     Fishman pickups are among the best in the industry, and after testing many different pickups, we've decided to partner with them on our acoustic-electric model. The pickup that we install is the Sonitone Electric Pickup. You can read more about the type of pickup we'll install here.   \n    Read more in depth reviews and stories on our blog. Our customers have tested the guitar in ways we never thought possible: biking over 10,000 kilometers with a guitar, summiting the 20, 310 ft Denali with a guitar, accompanying Doctors Without Borders to Tajikistan and more!\n           Deluxe Model\n                        How it all started  \nOne winter evening in early 2014, cofounder Adam Klosowiak forgot to close the windows to the bedroom of his college dorm for the duration of his winter break. Upon returning to school after vacation, he found the wooden body of his travel guitar had cracked from the bridge to the edge of the soundboard due to the cold and dry winter air. The sound was damaged for good! So his brother Ian decided to come up with a solution. \nHow we fixed it \nIan Klosowiak had plenty of experience both with playing guitar and working with composite materials (see Our CTO's Building Background). In an effort to have fun working with innovative materials for one of his college courses and to create a durable solution to Adam's problem, Ian crafted the very first KLOS guitar. The original KLOS guitar was very primitive compared to the model you see before you. We arrived to this model through an iterative prototyping process, which you can read more about in our blog. The final product is one that does not create a fear of damaging it when you travel with it, but rather enhances your motivation to play and travel. The KLOS guitar does not limit your sound when you're around the bonfire singing and playing, but rather booms forth your righteous tunes. The KLOS guitar does not compromise the status of your wallet, but rather leaves a small indentation that is quickly filled with love in the form of a six-stringed carbon fiber beauty!\nAlong with cofounder Jacob Sheffield, the small KLOS team has made it thus far with the help of hundreds of Kickstarter and Indiegogo backers, Princeton University's summer business accelerator, numerous business competitions, and the help of many friends and family members. \n           This project is promoted by Jellop, a direct\u00ad response online advertising agency specializing in Kickstarter campaigns on Facebook Ads and Google AdWords.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs in the previous three campaigns that we ran and successfully fulfilled, there are aways risks and challenges that are unforeseen.

I have at least 75% of the book complete and publishers interested, and I need support in order to write full time and get it submitted. THIS is the book true animal lovers have been waiting for.  It is the sequel to Riding On the Power of Others: A Horsewoman's Path to Unconditional Love.  If the first book was the WHAT -- the new book is the WHY and the HOW.  It has the power to change your life and the lives of those you love.\nAnimal Kin picks up where my first book left off.  I took what I had learned through the horses and began applying it to my dogs and any other relationship in my life.  The results were incredible.  The work proved my theories true, and in Animal Kin, you get to follow my journey with Denali -- a wild, uncontrollable husky I brought into my life for all the wrong reasons.  For the readers of my first book, that probably sounds familiar.  The other familiarity is that this journey proved and continues to prove just as transformational as the last, but the implications are even more far-reaching this time -- making what I've learned applicable and available to anyone with any sort of animal in their home or life, not just in the pasture.  \nDenali and I walking across a frozen Heart Lake with Mt Shasta on the horizon.\nGive it the right platform.\nI want to show some of the big names in spiritual publishing that this book has a market ready and waiting for a global response to the way humanity relates to animals on this planet.  I believe the answer to one of the biggest obstacles in humanity's evolution of consciousness is within the pages of my new book and in relationship to the animals we share our lives with.  Help me get my first publishing choice, Sounds True, to take notice of this novice writer with a big vision and an even bigger heart.\nDenali and I taking in the glory of our existence atop Castle Dome amongst Castle Crags -- dogs aren't technically allowed, but we aren't really the best at following rules.\nDomestication\nWe have become a domesticated society full of people and animals exploited for another's needs -- even in our most intimate, personal relationships.  The devastating result has been a worldwide forgetting of our true nature as well as the very meaning and power of love.  Whether we realize our own domestication or not, many of us perpetuate this state through our relationship to animals. I'm here to show you how to turn it around by reclaiming the deepest truth of unconditional love in relationship to those who have modeled it for centuries -- the animals in our lives.\nShe really is the most amazing teacher of what it means to be wild. Wild is presence and oneness with life. Wild is Love. Wild is God.\nWhy I need your help!\nMy life took a radical turn back in 2013 when I left everything I knew behind to pursue a deeper truth presented to me through my work with horses.  The entire story of that journey is the subject of my first book, Riding On the Power of Others: A Horsewoman's Path to Unconditional Love (see reviews on Amazon).  The revelations and transformation that have happened since the first book was written have left me in a unique position of caring for the 27 animals from my old life without the career or income from that life to do so.  I've had to completely start over with 13 horses, 6 mini equines, 3 pigs, 4 dogs, and a cat to be responsible for with no way to produce a steady income while I meet their needs and explore what they have taught me.  For four years, I've been living, learning, and developing a teachable body of work around these concepts, depending a great deal on the generous support of those that believe in this work.  I am currently camping full time on a beautiful new property we have leased for the horses, completely off-grid, in order to care for all the animals in sanctuary while I develop the work into a sustainable income.  That time has come, and the work is ready to teach, but I need financial support to meet our basic needs, make it accessible, and develop the sanctuary.\nOur primary classroom during the \"transition\" -- Grizzly Peak Trail in Ashland, OR. Wilderness isn't necessary for this work, but I needed to know exactly what was true and possible.\nWhat's in the book?\nThis book centers around my evolution in relationship to Denali.  About 18 months ago, I began applying the same principles with her that I used to heal my relationships with horses.  The results were amazing.  I knew in theory that it would work, but testing the power of love on an adventurous husky with a mind very much her own was daunting.  I am happy to say I now know for sure that this work transcends all species and levels of domestication.  You have the power to heal your life and relationships and the ability to reclaim the wild within us all, making fear, control, and the need for any and all training modalities completely obsolete.  This book is the manual and takes you along my journey with Denali, interweaving the story with the reasons this work is so important and how to do it yourself.  You get an in-depth explanation of Sanctuary13 -- the 13 principles I have developed to move you into unconditional love and out of codependency forever.\nPilot Rock adventuring in Ashland, OR\nHow will the money be used?\nThe greatest need right now is heat and electricity.  We are headed into Winter, and the off-grid life is getting even more challenging.  Ideally, this book will help launch a new career in writing, speaking, & educating, but the only way I'm going to get it finished or be able to produce other valuable content is if I have access to power, internet, and can pay for the basic needs of my family.  Other than day-to-day expenses for the animals and two humans that make up my family, we hope this successful campaign can purchase a small solar system to provide power and the installation of an internet connection here on site.  Anything beyond our campaign goal will go towards the development of the property as a model sanctuary and education center for my work.\nDenali models for Spur (and me!) how to move through the many layers of domestication to reclaim a deeper truth. Freedom lies within.\nThe future is in our hands.\nWe live in interesting and very challenging times.  It is up to each of us to step into what it really means to be the change.  I believe to the depths of my soul that this book can help.

In January of this year, we released XO Flo to provide a new, updated option in the world of menstrual cups! Now it's time to make the Mini so we can provide comfortable, sustainable period protection for even more body types. This new size is perfect for people who typically prefer slim to regular tampons, are younger, or have never given birth.\nAs a thank you for backing our project and helping us make XO Flo Mini a reality, for every pre-order we'll be GIVING one XO Flo to our non-profit partner to distribute to those in need!\nXO Flo Mini has a diameter of 41mm\nOur Mini size transforms the special design features of the classic XO Flo into a smaller scale, providing a more comfortable size option for young people and others who need a slimmer fit. Our customers (whether newbies or seasoned menstrual cup users) rave about XO Flo's thoughtful design:\n\"Amazing! This solves ALL of my major complaints that I have with the previous brands of cups that I have used!\"- Ambear, Colorado\n\"This cup is FANTASTIC! I've been using cups for nearly 20 years and so far, this one is the most comfortable.\" - Happymama8, Wisconsin\n\"I've used other cups for years, and after two cycles on the XO, I'm never going back... I've also had no leaks at all!\" - jet, Connecticut\nBut we need your help to make this new size of XO Flo happen! With your support, we'll also be able to distribute thousands of menstrual cups to menstruators in need, through our non-profit partner Period: the Menstrual Movement. For EVERY XO Flo sold through this Kickstarter, we\u2019ll GIVE one to someone who lacks access to safe, healthy menstrual products.\nXO Flo Mini is a thoughtfully designed menstrual cup we created to be more comfortable for smaller bodies. If you prefer slim to regular tampons, this cup is for you! The Mini is also a perfect fit for young people or teens, light flow, and those with a low cervix or sensitive bladder. \nDespite its small size, the XO Flo Mini has approximately double the capacity of a tampon and can be worn for up to 12 hours at a time. Made with medical grade silicone, it won't over-absorb or over-dry like a tampon can, and won't leave fibers behind in the vaginal canal. With proper usage and care, your cup can last up to 10 years!\nDESIGNED FOR COMFORT: Unique inner support rings help your XO Flo open fully to prevent leaks. Its comfortable internal rim and smooth design make for easier insertion and removal. XO Flo's flexible stem may be trimmed, but it's so comfortable you probably won't need to!\nHIGH CAPACITY: XO Flo Mini holds over 30ml; a tampon holds 15 ml or less, depending on the size. XO Flo can be worn for up to 12 hours at a time!\nRESPONSIBLY MADE: XO Flo is proudly made in the USA with high-quality, medical-grade silicone.\nZERO WASTE: Each XO Flo replaces 240 tampons per year, or 2,400 in its lifetime! Imagine no trash for 10 years--and no ongoing manufacturing waste from the creation, packaging, and shipping of thousands of tampons.\nSAVE MONEY: According to Jezebel, you're spending about $120 per year on disposable period products. XO Flo costs $35 (or less if you pre-order through this Kickstarter!) and can last for up to 10 years, saving you over $1,000!\nGIVE BACK: For every XO Flo ordered through this Kickstarter campaign, we'll give one to someone in need through our non-profit partner, Period.\nXO Flo & cotton storage pouch\nWe're so excited to work with Period: the Menstrual Movement to distribute XO Flo to menstruators in need! Period distributes free menstrual supplies to people struggling with homelessness, poverty, or domestic violence. Since 2014, they've provided products for over 160,000 periods!\nXO Flo is a sustainable option for menstrual care, as it don't need to be re-purchased on a monthly basis. Each XO Flo can take care of 120 periods and replaces thousands of tampons!\nXO Flo & packaging\nEvery XO Flo comes with detailed instructions and its own cotton storage pouch. When ordered through this Kickstarter, your XO Flo or XO Flo Mini (your choice!) will be delivered in its beautiful box with metallic foil accents.\nWe worked with Murmur Creative, a Portland design company, to develop XO Flo's unique branding and packaging. For XO Flo Mini, we'll enlist the help of the fabulous designers at Murmur once again to create packaging that reflects the luxurious, bold design of our menstrual cup.\n\"In a market where feminine hygiene products try to blend in as much as possible, XO Flo stands out.\" - The Dieline\nMore rewards:\nShow your period pride with a Uterus Love Pin measuring 1\" round.\nPledge at the Cloth Pantyliner Kit levels and receive 5 GladRags Color Pantyliners, a GladRags carry bag, mesh laundry bag, and the best-ever stain remover stick made by Buncha Farmers. \nReceive a limited edition Tote Bag featuring the cute menstrual cup love icon on XO Flo's packaging!\n*Limited Reward* -  \"A Cup in the Hand\" or \"Cup Comet\" enamel pins from our friends at Put A Cup In it.\n\"A Cup in the Hand\" Enamel Pin\n\"Cup Comet\" Enamel Pin\nXO Flo is made by injecting medical-grade silicone into a stainless steel mold. After the XO Flo Mini mold is tooled to our exact specifications by skilled engineers, we'll continue to use the same mold for years to produce the XO Flo Mini.\nThere's no two ways about it: creating the mold for such a precise product is just plain costly. We're SUPER proud that XO Flo is made in the United States, and we're asking for your help so that we can afford to make XO Flo Mini here in the USA, too.\nWe work with a family-owned company in California that's been in business for over 30 years, and they're as picky about quality as we are. In fact, they specialize in molding precision parts for medical equipment and aircrafts. The manufacturing of XO Flo? Basically rocket science!\nAt GladRags, we (Meagan & Tracy) have been helping menstruators choose reusable menstrual products every day for years. Across thousands of customer conversations and personally testing the wide world of reusable menstrual care, we've pooled our accumulated period knowledge to create something new and unique: XO Flo & XO Flo Mini!\nMeagan Brockway is the menstrual cup master of our team. Her eye for design and personal experience with a wide variety of menstrual cups lends XO Flo its innovative features and beautiful design. Meagan has three small dogs that often join us in the office, despite their lack of menstrual cup knowledge.\nTracy Puhl is the owner of GladRags and has personally used reusable menstrual products for over 10 years. Her passion for making a difference led to our partnership with Period, and she works hard to ensure that we always find new and innovative ways to use business as a force for good.\nThe two of us first worked together at a non-profit years ago, where we recognized a special spark in one another which would inevitably lead to collaboration. Others noticed too, and we were affectionately dubbed \"the dynamic duo!\" Together, Meagan & Tracy are Lady Business, a partner company inextricably paired with GladRags. This dynamic duo spends their days together at GladRags, where XO Flo was born following lots of research and many after-hours conversations envisioning the ideal menstrual cup!\nGladRags is a small business with big ideas: to make cloth pads and menstrual cups go mainstream and empower menstruators everywhere. From our office in Portland, Oregon, we ship comfortable, thoughtfully-designed reusable menstrual products to customers all over the world. Our menstrual cup, XO Flo, and full range of cloth pad styles provide menstruators of all types with body-friendly, versatile options that they can rely on for years.\nGladRags champions period positivity by displacing disgust and disposability with celebration and reusability. By reinforcing that menstruation is normal and educating the community about reusables, we erode the myth that periods should be shamed and hidden. As a result, reusables have rapidly shifted from \u201calternative menstrual hygiene\u201d to an option that\u2019s increasingly being embraced by the mainstream, particularly as the benefits like cost savings, concern for the earth, and the desire for a more comfortable period are being heralded by a growing GladRags online community.\nGladRags is proud to be a certified Benefit Corporation since 2012. As a woman-owned company that insists on a sustainable approach to business, we use local bike delivery to receive finished goods from our local sewing partner, pay meticulous attention to supply chain and waste reduction, and put our company values of environmentalism, inclusivity, and body positivity into the very heart of the GladRags brand.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere's always the potential for a delay in manufacturing due to factors outside of our control. We experienced this with the classic size of XO Flo, when we needed to have the mold fine-tuned to create a pristine finish. While delays are no fun, we're confident in our ability to weather them as a team in our quest to bring XO Flo Mini into the world! And we've added in some cushions into our timeline just in case!\n\nOur dream is to make both sizes of XO Flo accessible to all. Through our partnership with Period, we'll bring menstrual cups to homeless, low-income, and other marginalized populations. Of course, not all of these individuals have the desire or access to resources (such as clean water or a private bathroom) necessary for proper use of XO Flo. To ensure that all of the menstrual cups provided are actually used, Period works with service providers such as shelters and delivers reusable products in conjunction with education on how to use them. We'll continue to work with Period to monitor the effectiveness of giving reusable products to menstruators in need.\n\nTo make XO Flo accessible to all, we'll also continue working to get our menstrual cup on the shelves at brick and mortar stores across the USA. We've been working hard to provide education to store buyers who may not be aware these types of products even exist! With the successful funding of this Kickstarter, we'll be able to help stores provide an additional option to their customers.\n\nWe know we will always face challenges from fears and outdated ideas about periods. We believe the solution is to keep the conversation going and to raise the profile of safe, sustainable menstrual products that honor the natural processes of our bodies.

Besides, you can track your pulse with your own finger! Why pick a device that tracks a phenomenon you can track yourself? Sence tracks something fundamentally different and dramatically more precise: electrocardiography (ECG)\nNow you can see why Sence is able to track data that is so much more accurate than what's out there. Curious about how Sence can track ECG from just one wrist or how it uses that data to tell you what emotions you've experienced? Keep on reading!\nThere are two main pillars to understanding how the science behind Sence works:\n1. How SenceBand can accurately measure ECG signals from one wrist\n2. How SenceHub can turn those raw ECG signals into emotional insights\nOnce you understand both these concepts you'll really grasp why Sence is so revolutionary! Let's take a look at both these pillars individually.\nSenceBand's ECG Tracking from One Wrist\nSenceBand measures ECG using a patent-pending technology that allows it to cancel out the electromagnetic \"noise\" from your body. This mechanism filters out things like electrical signals from muscle contractions and leaves only the electromagnetic feed from your heart (ECG) . This filtering method is completely novel and makes SenceBand the only smart bracelet capable of measure ECG from one wrist.\nHow accurate is Sence? Below is the result of a test that was done that compared Sence to a standard, medical-grade ECG device. You'll see that the R-peaks (the critical phenomena to understanding true heart-rate and emotions) match up perfectly with the medical grade control.\nBut don't take our word for it! Check out our SenceBand prototype in action for yourself in the uncut demo videos below. We made them to show SenceBand's current prototype functionality so there are no doubts we are well on our way to a final product:\nVideo 1: Sence's ECG Signal\nVideo 2: Sence Tracking Emotions\nFeel free to skip to 3:25 for the test results if you wish!\nGetting Emotions from ECG Analysis\nOkay, so now you understand how SenceBand tracks ECG signals from just one wrist, but how can this help to infer anything about emotions? Aren't emotions all about what is going on in your brain? What does the heart have to do with emotions? Actually, there is an intimate link between the brain and heart. In fact, the heart's nervous system even contains 40,000 neurons!\nYour heart rate is determined by the two competing systems in the body: The sympathetic and the parasympathetic nervous systems. The sympathetic nervous system is known as the \"fight or flight\" pathway and it tries to pull your heart in a direction of excitement. The parasympathetic nervous system is known as the \"rest and digest\" pathway and tries to mellow your heart out and slow down its beats. All our emotions leave a unique footprint in this constant battle between sympathetic and parasympathetic control. These footprints can be read using heart rate variability (HRV) analysis of ECG data. Since Sence accurately tracks R-peaks it can identify the unique signals associated with each emotion.\n How Many Emotions can Sence Track?\nWith Sence's unique ability to analyze heart rate variability, it can track 64 different emotions and bodily states in you and your loved ones. Specifically, Sence can track 2 flavours (intensity levels) of each of the 32 emotions found below in Plutchik's Wheel of Emotions, a standard emotional reference tool in medicine and psychology:\nDon't get overwhelmed with all these emotions! Sence lets you pick the emotions to track that matter most to you and your lifestyle. The insight you glean from Sence can be as specific or broad as you want it to be.\nFurther Scientific Reading:\nWant to dig deeper into the Science behind Sence?

You'll be able to let people know if you had a generally good or bad day or even show them exactly what emotions you felt and where. This allows people using Sence become connected in ways never before possible, without even needing to be in the same room (or even country)!\nSence for Couples \nSence allows you understand not only your own emotions but those of that special someone. Know when to give them space or when they need a little pick me up! Be the best partner you can be with these revolutionary emotional insights.\nSence for Families \nTrack the health and emotional wellbeing of the more sensitive members of your family such as children so you can keep them safe and sound. With Sence you can get the insight you need to be the best parent or caregiver you can be.\nSence for Friends \nWith Sence you can get way more insight into your peer group than with a social media post. Are The Boys feeling a bit down lately as a group? Maybe it\u2019s time to go out for a night on the town! Sence connects you to your friends in ways that go way beyond words, pictures or even videos to make you feel more connected then ever before.\nThe Sence story features a long and winding journey with an unlikely origin. Originally, the Sence team assembled not to build a revolutionary hardware device but to collect high quality ECG screening data. With this data, they build a huge database that they hoped to sell to others. In order to acquire this data the Sence team set out with the monumental goal of screening 20,000 patients in rural Ukraine with a mobile hospital made up of 24 doctors, 24 nurses and modern ECG equipment. They planned to provide free check-ups and health guidance to these individuals who had little access to healthcare in exchange for their anonymous ECG data.\nSound like an impossible task? The Sence team actually exceeded expectations and comprehensively screened 22,433 patients in 52 days. This unprecedented study got Planexta (the makers of Sence) many adulations worldwide from cardiac societies and the like.\nPlanexta Inc. is officially recognized to have performed the largest cardio screening ever to test for 260 parameters in under 52 days by a National records society.\nWith the massive amount data Planexta now had, they set out to find the right wearable technology company to sell it to. Unfortunately, they didn\u2019t find a good fit! All the current devices either didn\u2019t use rigorous enough ECG measurements to make use of the data or they measured ECG in such an impractical way that users would never take enough readings for the data to be useable.\nWhat a waste! So much data was now available but there was no wearable sophisticated enough to use it. Instead of giving up, the Sence team decided to take it upon themselves to create (from scratch) an ECG measuring wearable that was both accurate and extremely practical for consumers to use. They created a lab dedicated to this task called Platform20k (as a memento of the monumental screening tour) and hired 13 top experimental physicists and engineers, the begin work on SenceBand.\nIt took the team over a year to succeed, but SenceBand became a reality due to the discovery and implementation of a whole new method of measuring ECG. Now, Sence has the hardware and the software foundations to do something truly revolutionary. However, Sence is still a scrappy little company and genuinely needs YOUR help to actualize the immense potential Sence technology has to improve people's lives. The Sence team thanks you for every last dollar of support!\n  SenceBand\u2019s design was created by the famous Red Dot Award winner, Donn Koh and his Singaporean team at Stuck Design. Before helping to create SenceBand he worked on multiple projects for Microsoft, Dell, Samsung, HTC and T-Mobile. Our engineers and physicists worked closely with Donn Koh\u2019s team to ensure technological prowess and aesthetics could co-exist in SenceBand\u2019s unmistakable appearance. Check out Sence's visual journey below:\n                                                                                                    This project was developed and is being managed by BeyondNature, a company specializing in launching innovative products through crowdfunding and transitioning them into mass-market powerhouses.\n      Customer Service Specialist 1\nCustomer Service Specialist 2", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have an international and seasoned team with top professionals from big pharma companies such as Pfizer, Merck, Novartis and Genzyme. However, in this instance we are still a startup and even our formidable experience does not make us immune to the nearly inevitable ebbs and flows that come with launching and fulfilling a successful crowdfunding campaign. Although we will use every ounce of our experience to ensure each aspect of our campaign and fulfillment is approached efficiently and professionally and that we are 100% transparent with our backers along the way, the following risks are absolutely worth considering when backing this campaign:\n\nSupply Chain Risk\n\nAlthough our manufacturers and product developers have extensive experience with other high-tech projects, they have not manufactured SenceBand itself yet. Any new product has the potential to have delays in the first go around as unexpected hurdles present themselves. That being said, we have attempted to build these unforeseen delays into our project timelines above by adding in a significant buffer from our current delivery timeline estimations. We'd much rather deliver unexpectedly early than be time-crunched to meet our project deadline.\n\nProduct Registration and Licensing Risks\n\nAlthough SenceBand contains clinical-grade ECG technology, we are not using it to diagnose or treat any medical conditions. This makes product registration a relatively straightforward process in most places in the world. Especially for a bunch of ex-pharma guys like us who have had to go through the medical drug registration process. That being said, we are not experts with global regulatory requirements with this particular product and there is a slight possibility ensuring this device is properly registered in your country could cause a delay to fulfillment. We will do our utmost due, diligence to make sure no delays occur in this area but we are obliged to make all our backers know that they are indeed a possibility.\n\nOther Risks\n\nThere are likely a ton of mini-risks that we haven't yet considered for the project but discovering them and overcoming them will be part of the fun we have together. Our main objective is to make this project successful as efficiently as possible and keep everyone in the loop with diligent communication and an open dialogue with our backers.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "FOLLOW US", "descp": "This Reward can be Cancelled anytime!

Motivated and driven by personal aspirations, these individuals dared to take risks in pursuit of their dreams. Their journeys and the experiences they share will inspire and motivate you to choose a similar path, a path inviting you to follow your own dreams and live a life of fulfillment.\n        Mike and Jay Glauser have been interviewing entrepreneurs together, as father and son, for 6 years now.  During the summer of 2014, with a team of 4, they embarked on a 4,000 mile bicycle adventure traveling from the west coast of Oregon to the east coast of Virginia.  As technology replaces jobs, their mission was to interview 100 small town entrepreneurs in 100 cities to see how everyday Americans have found success doing what they love, where they want to live. \nWith no shortage of coverage in the media highlighting big corporations and successful multi mullion dollar tech companies, the smaller successful individuals and businesses in America are often overshadowed and overlooked.  Not everyone can create the next Facebook or Google or eBay, but everyone can create businesses that fill needs in their communities. \nThe people they met and the stories of success they heard during their two month long journey along Main Street America is a something that they want to share with the world. \nA book written by team member Dr. Mike Glauser titled \"Main Street Entrepreneur\" was recently released which details their cross country adventure as well as shares the keys to success that are being implemented by the entrepreneurs they interviewed. With so many inspiring stories and examples that each of us can learn from, the team wants to take this project one step further and release a full length feature documentary.   \n  We've had the opportunity of interviewing hundreds of entrepreneurs in different industries all across America, getting an intimate look into their lives and their stories.  We\u2019ve interviewed everyone from local blacksmiths, to coffee shop owners, to entrepreneurs who own biogas engineering plants, clothing and apparel businesses, waste management companies, and urban farming supply stores.\nAs diverse as these businesses are, we've found that their stories of success are very similar. The fear, uncertainty, struggles and setbacks that each of them have faced with starting a new venture and the perseverance to get to where they are today is something that each of us can learn from. \nThe following entrepreneurs are just a few of the hundreds that we've been able to interview\n Marshall Miller - GoPro Bomb Squad\nMarshall is a world-class paraglider pilot, ski BASE jumper, and PRO-rated skydiver. He travels the world in search of new and unique places to take to the skies. He picked up a paraglider for the first time in 1999 and discovered his life\u2019s purpose: flying. As an aerial enthusiast with an infectious obsession with the sky, Marshall was determined to find a way to make a living with both feet off the ground. In 2008 he and several friends struck a deal with GoPro and cofounded the GoPro Bomb Squad allowing them to travel the world.\nDavid Toledo & Caleb Light - Power Practical\nHow would it be if you were in the backcountry and your mp3 player had continual juice or you were able to charge other electronics whenever you wanted? Meet Power Practical, a company that created a product called the Power Pot that uses heat to charge usb devices. Just add water to the Power Pot, place it on a heat source and within seconds you can have your phone charging. \n In order to get the funding for their initial product, Power Practical launched a Kickstarter campaign that was successfully funded.  Since then, they have done an additional five other Kickstarter campaigns raising over $1.5 million. The producers of Shark Tank took note of their success and revolutionary product line and invited them to appear on the show where David and Caleb were able to land a deal with Mark Cuban who gave them $250,000 for 12 percent of the company. These young entrepreneurs show us that anybody can build a wildly successful business with a good idea that is properly executed.\nTonya Montalvo - Intervention Group\nTonya grew up feeling like a protector to her siblings.

She is now the founder, a.k.a. \"Chief\", of Intervention Group, a private security firm based out of Oakland, CA.  She currently has more than 20 employees and over 500 contracts around the Bay Area.\nJustin Gold - Justin's Nut-Butter\nJustin is a pioneer in the natural food industry. He started making homemade nut butters with a food processor in his home kitchen in 2004. His unique blends of peanut butter and natural flavorings were a huge hit at the Farmers Market in Boulder, Colorado. Today, Justin\u2019s products are sold across North America and internationally in fine retailers including Whole Foods Market, Kroger, Safeway, Cost Plus World Market, HEB, Super Target, and Jewel-Osco. Justin is committed to making the finest organic and all-natural nut butters and peanut butter cups on the planet.\n Nicole Campos - Bling Inc.\nNicole started selling purses and jewelry out of her basement with no idea her business would take off the way that it did.  Within six months she opened her first store.  She now has multiple retail locations throughout Kansas and sells products online.\nDan & Suzanne Marino - Jackson Hole Buffalo Meat Co.\nFrom a young age, Dan Marino always wanted to live in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. The day after he graduated from high school he packed up his 1966 Mustang, drove to Jackson Hole and he's been there ever since. Dan and his wife Suzanne are the third owners of Jackson Hole Buffalo company and took the business from a local stage to a national one. Their company specializes in different cuts and preparation of buffalo and elk meat which they ship all over the nation. They are a perfect example of individuals creating a lifestyle for themselves, doing something they love in a place they love.\nChris Washburn - Fezzari Bicycles\nImagine leaving behind a successful career in corporate America in pursuit of finding greater satisfaction doing something you truly love! That's exactly what Chris Washburn did when he created Fezzari Bicycles. High demands of work travel causing him to miss out on family events and a desire to create and do something on his own is what led to this life-changing decision. Fezzari Bicycles is no ordinary bike shop. It's much more than that. Based on three important principles, the company offers 100% customized products to provide every user a perfect fit, guarantees top of the line quality that competes with any high-end bike manufacturer, and deals directly with the consumer to offer the best prices. Chris's story is a testament that greater happiness comes when you're doing something you are passionate about.\nIn order to understand our motivation behind this project and why we want to share it with you, it's important to talk about a few key points.\n  Small businesses play a vital role in our economy, they are the engines of job creation. There are 28 million of them in America and they provide 55% of all jobs, employing over 56 million people.\nThese businesses account for 54% of all US sales.  Whether it's a local floral shop, or a small restaurant or bookstore, they contribute to local economies by bringing growth and innovation to the community in which the business is established. Main Street Businesses truly are the backbone of the economy.\nExperts are projecting that nearly half of our occupations will become obsolete due to new technology and that four out of five of us will experience significant periods of unemployment during our careers. We don't want to sound like alarmists, but there is a huge employment shift on the horizon and we need to be ready to know how to handle it. \nAccording to a recent Gallup pole, 2/3 of US employees are unengaged with their work. In other words, they aren't happy working jobs that take up 38% of their time during the week. When you don't like doing something, dedicating an hour to it is torture, let alone 40 hours per week!\nSmall businesses and entrepreneurship are key to the success and growth of our economy. The jobs that they create help to replace the ones that are lost to automation and small business owners around the country are spending their work week doing what they love. By sharing the success stories of dozens of these everyday Americans, we hope to educate, inspire, and motivate others to take control of their lives and spend their time doing something they love through entrepreneurship.\nWe are excited to offer a variety of rewards that will teach, motivate, and help you to become a Main Street Entrepreneur and part of the #MainStreetMovement. We have something for everyone, rewards for rookie entrepreneurs looking to get started all the way up to serial entrepreneurs who have already made their mark on Main Street. Take a look at the reward tiers below and let us know if there are other things that you would like to see offered.\n    T-shirts offered in 4 different colors\n  Click here to see what people are saying about Dr. Glauser's book\n  Check out the Training Program content by clicking here\n       MIKE GLAUSER\nMike should be renamed \u201cMr. Entrepreneur.\u201d He has built successful ventures in the retail, wholesale, consulting and educational industries. He has consulted with hundreds of startup companies and large corporations. Mike has written two previous top selling books on entrepreneurship: Glorious Accidents and The Business of Heart. Earlier in his career he toured Europe in a band and recorded an album on vinyl, which his kids call \u201cthat big black CD thing.\u201d Mike is currently the Executive Director of the Clark Center for Entrepreneurship in the Jon M. Huntsman School of Business at Utah State University. When he is not in his office, he is riding his bike in the spectacular mountains of Utah, playing a mean banjo, reading books, hanging out with his wife Mary, and eating sushi with his five sons.\n   JAY GLAUSER\nJay is our creative genius. His passions are videography and music. He has filmed more than 100 successful entrepreneurs around the world to create training programs and dozens of short videos about how people are making a living.  He also has broad experience with new ventures in the music industry. Having planned, promoted and managed hundreds of concerts across the United States, Jay is no stranger to fun. He is a founding member of two national touring bands and has created, marketed, and sold thousands of event-related products. He has extensive experience with street teams, radio, print, and social media. When Jay is not creating films, he is playing music, traveling, working on his house with his fianc\u00e9, Jael, and hanging with friends.\n     ANDY THUNELL\nAndy also has a passion for film which has recently taken him to places like Guatemala and Peru. He made his debut in the world of entrepreneurship as a small business owner when he turned a passion into an opportunity to earn income. As an avid whitewater kayaker himself, Andy saw a need and high interest for instruction and in 2009, Rapid Progression Kayak School was born. Over the years he has had many unique opportunities broadening his experience in business. These opportunities range from managing and creating a YouTube sensation working with a blind pianist, to founding a social entrepreneurship venture in the highlands of Guatemala.  Andy works at the Jeffery D. Clark Center for Entrepreneurship in the Jon M. Huntsman School of Business at Utah State University.  He can also be found with his wife and two boys, traveling, eating out, and of course kayaking.\n  In order to get our project to it's current phase, we've pooled together our own personal resources. We've spent thousands of dollars and thousands of hours traveling, interviewing and getting content for the documentary. Although we are close, there is still a considerable amount of work to be done which will still cost a good chunk of money. Your support of this project will help us do the following in order to get Main Street Entrepreneur to the finish line as a polished finish product, ready to share with you and the rest of the world:\nAdditional Filming\nStoryboarding & planning \nPost production \nAssistant Editing\nMusic licensing\nLegal fees\nTravel\nResearch\nMarketing and promotion \nFilm festival registration fees\n   ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOur team is comprised of individuals who have experience working with and running successful crowdfunding campaigns.

To overcome the limits, where footwear starts to be a burden rather than a benefit, we developed Skinners \u2013 ultraportable footwear for every adventure.\nRevolutionary adhesive-free technology\nTurn on the audio! You will thank us later :))\nPLAY\n\nFITNESS, YOGA \u2013 Socks, flip-flops, running shoes. Skinners disrupt this trinity of gym footwear and combine the advantages of each \u2013 the freedom of a sock, the great grip and the basic protection of shoes.\nTRAVELLING \u2013 That 10-hour flight or bus ride can be tough on your feet \u2013 trapped in shoes simply because you can\u2019t take them off due to the cold, dirty ground or embarrassing odor.\nCAMPING, HIKING \u2013 Those 4-pounds boots got the job done on that 20-mile hike but now it\u2019s time to take off those heavy casts and give your feet a rest. Skinners let you move around the campground without getting dirty, wet or stung.\nRUNNING, ATHLETICS \u2013 Enrich your training on natural or soft surfaces and activate all your foot muscles and tendons. Skinners simulates the barefoot experience and forces your feet to adapt to the terrain. A strong athlete starts with strong feet.\nOFFICE \u2013 We love your fashionable high-heels and Oxfords :). But usually 6 hours out of 8 at the air-conditioned office you are hiding them under the desk. And to be honest, because of comfort it's possible they end up next to your cold, dirty ground touching feet. Don't risk getting cold and tune up your work performance with Skinners! \nROLLER BLADING \u2013 Getting to the bike path, descending hills or getting over other obstacles in the way can be tough. But who wants to spend the whole ride with a sweaty back from carrying their spare shoes around?\nSIMPLY ANYWHERE\u2026 take Skinners on your next walk with your dog, use them around the house or just at home. Take them to a beach-volleyball game, slackline, yoga session or wherever you want.

We invented Skinners to keep this masterpiece effectively protected and at the same time support all of the amazing things it can already do.\nSkinners are handmade in the heart of Europe and are produced without harming people, animals or the environment (vegan and barefoot friendly).\nWHY KICKSTARTER\nThe new production technology costs est. 16 000 USD and the costs regarding basic certification and patenting reach up to 4 000 USD. That makes 20 000 USD in total.\nWe were able to put half of the money up front from our own pockets, but we still need additional 10 000 USD.

TubShroom\u00ae is now the #1 best-seller in the category on Amazon and on its way to the retail channels across the nation. TubShroom\u00ae is now protecting drains in over 75,000 homes! And the number of the loyal \"Shroom\" fans is growing each day. \nThe product reviews have been phenomenal and many of you had asked for the same simple solution for your bathroom sink drains. Well, we listened, and now we present to you the one and only... SinkShroom\u2122.\nMeet the new SinkShroom\u2122\n  We have tested the SinkShroom\u2122 vigorously. And yes, it does a great job catching hair, jewelry and anything in-between, while the water continues to flow freely. \nAnd the best part is that for the price of just a couple of bottles of Dran-o or Liquid Plumr, you are getting a solution that will prevent clogs and last for many years.  \nSinkShroom\u2122 is ready to serve and protect :)\nSinkShroom\u2122 is based on the same revolutionary concept as TubShroom\u00ae. It goes inside the drain, stopping hair, jewelry and other undesired objects from going down the drain preventing nasty and hard to deal with clogs. It\u2019s designed to fit any standard bathroom sink that is 1.25\u201d in diameter. It comes in the same colors to match your TubShroom\u00ae plus we're adding a new color \u2013 Silver/Gray to match the chrome/stainless steel appliances. You will be able to pick the color of your choice in the survey that will be sent to you at the end of the campaign. \nBoth SinkShroom\u2122 and TubShroom\u00ae are patent-pending. We feel confident that our winning designs can become the standard in bathroom drain protection around the world, eliminating the need for harmful chemical cleaners or costly plumber visits. We've set out to make the planet--and your wallet--greener than it would be otherwise. \nInstallation and Maintenance Illustration\nInstallation literally takes seconds and when it comes to performance, SinkShroom\u2122 is second to none.  If your sink is equipped with a stopper, it can easily be removed. Just loosen the screw located below the sink and pull out the stopper. \nSinkShroom\u2122 in Action\nFor such a small product, the benefits are numerous. If you've tried other drain protectors or hair strainers already, you know how much room there is for improvement in this space. SinkShroom\u2122 gets it right every time. \nFor those of you that missed our first campaign and haven\u2019t had a chance to enjoy the benefits of a TubShroom\u00ae, we offer SinkShroom\u2122 + TubShroom\u00ae combos. \nAnd here's how the original TubShroom\u00ae works...\nTubShroom\u00ae in Action\n  TubShroom\u00ae\n  Cleanup is fast and extremely easy!\nCombos packs are available in this campaign.  \nTubShroom\u00ae and SinkShroom\u00ae\nHere're some of the recent Amazon reviews of the TubShroom\u00ae:\n  We would like to thank all our new and existing backers as well as Kickstarter for making our first project possible and look forward to another successful campaign. Thank you! \n     -\nGet your project funded today!\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs is the case with any product, shipping and manufacturing delays are always a possibility. We are committed to adhering strictly to our timelines and getting the SinkShroom\u2122 produced on schedule. We gave ourselves a couple of weeks of extra time just in case there's an unexpected delay. Should everything go as planned we will actually deliver earlier than promised.\n\nThroughout the research and development process, we\u2019ve experimented with many different designs in order to develop the perfect strainer. After an extensive process, we have created a functional prototype to our design specifications, which will help expedite the production process once SinkShroom\u2122 reaches its funding goal.\nLearn

Society and governments alike are coming to the realization that the vast majority of plastics used on a daily basis are made in such a way that they practically last forever in landfills or--worse yet--our oceans.

We\u2019re excited because professional looking video is now simple, compact and affordable enough for everyone!\nTake it anywhere and everywhere, and when inspiration strikes you'll have it to record great video to keep and share forever. Use Smoovie at home, on the go or on your next adventure!\nHere's how using Smoovie compares to handheld.\nTraditional video stabilisers are much bigger and heavier, with tricky and time consuming set up. Instead of relying on weight and friction Smoovie cleverly uses magnetic force, allowing anyone to record smooth video without all that bulk.\nPLAY\n\nBe more creative with you video! Here's what we shot in a day in London. (No post stabilisation)  \nWe've made Smoovie really simple easy to set up. Just pull out the telescopic counterweight balance to the marker for your smartphone or GoPro, and Smoovie calibrates itself! Aaand action!\nBe more creative with your shots! The handle is adjustable so you can get the shots you want. Get up high or go down low!\nPlus with a more natural handgrip there's no more holding your smartphone at odd angles so no more wrist ache!\nThe patent-pending gimbal design uses two lightweight but super strong neodymium magnets. This magnetic attraction is what keeps shots steady by reducing the shaking created when you walk or move. Go where you like and record fantastic looking smooth videos!\nCompact size 19cm x 4cm x 3.5cm (and extends up to 11cm).\n\nWeight 125 grams (4.4 oz), that's less than a Big Mac!\nHolds All popular Apple, Android and Windows smartphones up to 86mm in width and 225 grams in weight. Plus all GoPro models with Smoovie Plus.\nMaterials Two strong neodymium N42 magnets, durable ABS and acetal plastic body, protective TPE rubber pads and long-lasting stainless steel telescopic tubes.\nIt's not quite as good as the large, heavy and expensive equipment that professionals use. But we're excited about Smoovie because it's affordable, easy for everyone and can be taken everywhere. When inspiration strikes, you'll have it! \nFor GoPro users you can capture all of the action with Smoovie Plus. With the Smoovie Plus option you'll get Smoovie for smartphones with an additional interchangeable adapter to use with your GoPro tripod mount.\nBack us today and help us go into production.

Currently the design is going through a final iteration to refine the aesthetics so that Smoovie looks and feels great too. \nIn January this year Alex travelled to China to discuss the manufacture of the Smoovie project with factories the team had long term relationships with already. After comparing the quality of prototypes produced and manufacturing processes, a selection was made.\nWe are confident that the manufacturer we have chosen is best suited to help us get Smoovie ready for mass production so that we can deliver a product that satisfies our requirements and more importantly that you'll be happy with.\nWe are an experienced team based in London and HK who have designed, developed and delivered products  on a global scale. We know how to bring innovative ideas to life and take them to market. \nOur product designer Alex Kalogroulis has worked on many innovational designs. In his early years he worked alongside British Inventor Sir Clive Sinclair on the award-winning A-Bike which is displayed in London\u2019s Design Museum. Alex has also led design on other products like Sea Scooters and Smart Touch kitchen gadgets. He also teaches future designers on the Innovation Design Engineering master\u2019s course at London\u2019s Royal College of Art. \nWe're so excited to see what you'll do with Smoovie.

By pairing advanced 3D audio algorithms with head-tracking and individual anatomy calibration, we deliver incredibly accurate 3D sound to your ears. Experience music like never before. Get more immersed in virtual reality. Bring gaming to the next level.\n INSTANT CALIBRATION FOR A 10X AUDIO EXPERIENCE \nOSSIC X calibrates to the individual listener\u2019s head and ear features, increasing overall sound quality and ensuring the most accurate sound placement, making for a listening experience that\u2019s ten times more immersive than current technologies. \nIncreased audio immersion \nHear your movies and music like never before \nIncreased sense of space with your audio content\nAudio is a crucial part of the way we experience content. By implementing accurate 3D audio, any content can take the listener to new places by improving the following:\nOSSIC X FOR VIRTUAL REALITY\nIn virtual reality, sound is key. With accurate 3D sound we can give a sense of space and direct your attention to elements outside your field of view for a more immersive experience. \nDrastically improved sound localization \nIncreased sense of presence \nAccurately render sound in any x,y,z coordinate in space\nOSSIC X FOR GAMING\nHaving accurate sound in gaming can make or break the experience, allowing you to know what\u2019s going on in the spaces of the game that you can\u2019t see. \nImmerse yourself in the game\nAccurately position sounds for a competitive advantage \nBoomless mic for continued audio communication\nOSSIC X FOR MOVIES\nImagine being able to watch any movie on the best speaker setup money can buy, from the comfort of your couch, bed, or anywhere. \nEnjoy any movie theater audio experience from wherever you are.\nOSSIC X FOR MUSIC \nOSSIC changes the way you listen to music. Imagine being able to listen to any song from your collection on the best speaker setup money can buy, or hear a concert from the best seats in your favorite concert hall. \nReplicate the ideal listening room or speaker setup. \nHear your music exactly how the artist intended.\nSee and hear what others have said about hearing 3D audio for the first time.\nWE ALL HEAR THE WORLD DIFFERENTLY BASED ON OUR ANATOMY\nHow we hear the world is not a one-size-fits all situation. It's our physical anatomy that plays a critical role in defining how sound enters our ears. This is called our head related transfer function, or HRTF. Our individual HRTF is based on: \nOur position in space \nThe size of our head \nThe shape of our ears\nTRADITIONAL HEADPHONES DON\u2019T ACCOUNT FOR OUR ANATOMY\nWith traditional headphones the listeners anatomy is not taken into account. This makes for an incredibly small listening experience, where sound remains close to your head rather than around you. This leads to: \nA \u201cclose to your head\u201d listening experience\nInaccurate ability to place sounds in space\nDegradation in overall sound quality\nCALIBRATION PUTS YOU BACK INTO THE LISTENING EQUATION\nOSSIC X calibrates to the individual listener\u2019s head and ear feature, increasing overall sound quality and ensuring the most accurate sound placement, making for a listening experience that\u2019s ten times more immersive than current technologies. \nHOW IT WORKS\nThe OSSIC calibration process starts as soon as you put the headphones on. The data is instantly paired with our smart algorithms to determine accurate sound playback based on your anatomy and position. No laboratories required.\nOSSIC X INSTANTLY MEASURES LISTENER'S ANATOMY\nHRTF DATA IS INTEGRATED INTO OSSIC ALGORITHMS\nMULTI-DRIVER ARRAY ENSURES ACCURATE SOUND LOCATION PLAYBACK\n3D Audio naturally replicates the way we hear the world everyday, with measurable results. \nThis is done with two types of testing: \nPHYSICS-BASED TESTING\nAcoustical, physics-based testing. With a microphone in the ear, does the headphone reproduce the same signal as a real sound in space? Here we compared the OSSIC X to a gaming headphone. \nPEOPLE-BASED TESTING\nWe ask people where they think the sound comes from with the headphone on, and compare it to where the sound was supposed to come from. Here we can see the OSSIC X places sound at the right angle and depth and the gaming headphone does not.\nUsing the AUX or USB connection, OSSIC X is compatible with a multitude of devices to provide 3D audio playback.\nWhile the OSSIC X already supports existing standard 2D formats such as stereo, 5.1, and 7.1, we want to make it easy for game and sound designers to go beyond. By using the OSSIC X, you can design fully immersive soundscapes without installing ceiling speakers or sitting in your studio.\nFOR GAME ENGINES \nIn gaming engines, the sounds can be tied to any objects or characters, and these are already natively positioned in 3D. Currently these sounds get compressed to, at most, 7 channels (and a subwoofer) on a ring around the listener. We are designing plugins that let natively 3D audio pass through to the listener.\nWe already have a prototype FMOD plug-in running, and it sounds great and operates efficiently. We are testing it with some early developers now. We would love to hear from you! Please fill out the survey to prioritize roll-out for the different platforms: Unity, Unreal, FMOD, Wwise, VST, AU, and/or others. \nTake our Developer Survey\nFOR SOUND DESIGNERS \nFor audio produced using standard DAWs, we will be supporting VST and AU.\nABBEY ROAD RED\nOSSIC is proud to join the latest class of innovative companies at Abbey Road Red, a music and technology incubation program within the world famous Abbey Road Studios.

These elements will make the box reusable and travel friendly.\nStretch Goal 3: We will now enable 3D audio connectivity through phones and tablets equipped with micro-USB. \nStretch Goal 4: This stretch goal will allow 3D audio connectivity via Lightning cable to Apple phones and tablets. \nOSSIC started in a home living room in August 2014. Since that time, we\u2019ve spent the last year and a half developing over 9 generations of prototypes and countless acoustic tests in order to bring accurate 3D audio to headphones. \nTESTING\nPROTOTYPE DEVELOPMENT\nThe founding team in order: Jason Riggs - CEO, David Carr - CPO, Jose Arjol Acebal - COO, Joy Lyons, CTO\nA MISSION TO CHANGE THE WAY WE HEAR SOUND\nAfter working in the audio industry for a combined fifty years developing some of the top selling headphones and speakers on the market, our founding team realized there was a large gap in what was currently available for 3D sound, and what was possible. The technology was available, but limited by intensive laboratory calibration and typically coming at very high cost. The team believed that everyone should have access to the highest level of audio experience possible, so they formed OSSIC in 2015 with one mission: to redefine the way we hear sound by taking the final leap between reproduced audio and audio that's indistinguishable from reality.\nWe\u2019re redefining the way we hear audio in headphones. While we\u2019ve come this far with an incredibly small team and a boot-strapped budget, we need your help in making this technology a reality. \n MANUFACTURING COSTS \nThis is the most capital intensive part of our next phase. We\u2019ve developed many headphones over the course of our careers, so we\u2019ve got a very good idea on costs needed to produce the initial molds, purchase supplies, meet the minimum quantity order, and ship to consumers. We need your help to get us to the production phase of our hardware. \nCREATING THE NEXT GENERATION OF 3D AUDIO\nOur goal is to not only develop a product, but help educate the world on the potential of what a 10X improvement in audio immersion can sound like. To do this, we need your support from this initial campaign to not only fund our production, but also get the word out about what we\u2019re developing.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs with any hardware project, there are always schedule risks associated with manufacturing and supply chain logistics.\n\nThe OSSIC team has successfully delivered hundreds of audio products to market.

We\u2019re never the same people at the end of the journey as we were when we started out.\nBut the luggage we bring with us stubbornly stays the same. Why is that?\nThink about it: Right now, your closet is stuffed with pieces of luggage, each one with a single purpose.\nYour carry-on roller bag is a box on wheels that has only seen the inside of airports and hotel rooms. You dread the wrinkles you have to iron out of your clothes when you get to your destination\u2014that is, if the carry-on doesn\u2019t get checked at the gate and then lost somewhere between connecting flights.\nYour gym bag is a big, stinky sack of dirty laundry and toiletries all tossed together like a funk salad. When you go from the gym to work, you have to hide it under your desk or in the trunk of your car because it\u2019s out of place in your buttoned-up office.\nYour $500 hiking backpack is up on a shelf collecting dust. You bought it for a trip to Alaska. That was five years ago. It\u2019s nice, but at 70 liters it\u2019s too cumbersome and specialized to use as an everyday pack.\nYour laptop bag is great for carrying your laptop. That\u2019s it. But it\u2019s a pain to get around with a laptop bag and a carry-on roller bag when you\u2019re hailing a cab or riding the train to the airport.\nYour cycling backpack makes your back sweaty and your clothes wrinkled. When you finally get to work, even after you change your clothes, you look like you\u2019ve been biking through a torrential rainstorm.\nThen there\u2019s your well-worn backpack you\u2019ve had for a decade. Its buckles are broken, there are holes in the bottom, and you have many painful memories of being the person at the front of the coffee shop line, dumping your personal effects onto the counter in a desperate hunt for your wallet.\nSo far, that\u2019s six bags, each made for different functions, occasions and settings. Add to the mix your hydration pack for mountain biking, your briefcase, and the monogrammed fanny-pack your great-aunt gave you ---that\u2019s a ton of baggage.\nAnd what about all the emotional baggage? Stress, embarrassment, frustration, dread\u2026\nYou don\u2019t need all that baggage. \nYou are one person on an amazing journey. \nYou need one bag that transforms to reflect and simplify the many facets of your life.\nThat\u2019s what the Slicks Travel System is all about.\nThe Slicks Travel System is designed as a modular luggage system, available either as a base backpack only or in three tailored options (SUIT, TRIP & BIZ), each with additional internal inserts to expand the function of the pack.\nLet\u2019s take a look the many ways your stuff can fit into the Slicks Travel System (and the many ways the Slicks Travel System will fit into your life).\nCool, huh?\nCheckout these two videos we made that demonstrate better how you can pack up your Slicks:\nFor 2-3 days business trips\nPLAY\n\nFor 3-4 days leisure holidays\nPLAY\n\nNow let\u2019s take a closer look at the base backpack. \nLet\u2019s say you need a great travel bag that can meet the demands of all kinds of travel, be it your daily commute to work, leisure getaway or business trip. You\u2019ve got that with our 30 Litre capacity Slicks backpack. \nFirst of all, take a look at the exterior design:\nThere\u2019s a reason we call it \u201cSlicks.\u201d We wanted to eliminate all of the hanging bits and bobs (aka \u201cslop\u201d in the baggage industry) and bulky pockets associated with backpacks. The result is a sleek, modern-yet-timeless shape. \nYou get three color options to choose from: \nDiscrete Black with grey back panel\nSporty Yellow with grey back panel\nStealthy All-Black with black back panel\nInstead of external pockets, we\u2019ve created discreetly-positioned interior pockets behind hidden zippers.\nFor added security, we have designed zipper pockets where you can stow the zipper pullers, making it difficult for thieves to easily access your valuables.\nWhen needed, you can additionally lock up the main compartment and laptop compartment to secure your pack contents.\nThe front duffle-bag style pocket is a great spot for bulky and irregular shaped items that are the bane of most bags.\nOn the side, hidden behind a flap, you will find a dedicated compartment for your shoes.\nThe pack keeps your laptop safe and within easy reach thanks to a dedicated laptop compartment that fits devices up to 15-inches and is suspended for even better protection.\nNeed to do a quick change to a hipster street look or Mr. Professional? No problem- we've got you covered with Slicks.\nJust stow away one of the shoulder straps and sling the other one over your shoulder to use your Slicks as a trendy messenger bag.\nOr just unclip both the straps and tuck them away, and voila: your Slicks is an elegant attach\u00e8.\nHere's how Slicks (and you!) transform:\nAnd yes, unlike many bags claiming to be carry-ons, the Slicks pack is compliant with the latest IATA carry-on size recommendations.\nThe 600D PU-coated Nylon material is water resistant, but just for peace of mind, the pack comes with a seam-sealed, light-weight rain cover stashed in a hidden side pocket, ready to slip on in the event of a downpour.\nAnd if you find yourself cycling at night or crossing roads in foggy weather, we have got plenty of reflective bits on the pack, zipper and rain over to keep you safe. And shiny.\nNow let\u2019s crack this baby open and see what\u2019s on the inside:\nYou\u2019ll notice that in addition to the classic \u201copen from the top\u201d access found in most backpacks, you can also open the Slicks like a suitcase and lay it flat \u2014 the clamshell style makes packing easier. \nOh, and what\u2019s this? More pockets? Yep: a pocket for storing valuables, another one for documents, and a mesh pocket as well.\nNow that we\u2019ve gotten to know the base pack, let\u2019s acquaint ourselves with what makes the Slicks Travel System a System: the modular inlays. \nAre you always on the move, commuting from work to play or vice versa? The SUIT option is designed for anyone who needs to look dapper while they\u2019re on the road.\nWith the SUIT option, the Slicks backpack comes with an ingenious removable Suitcover that keeps your business suit and shirt secure and wrinkle-free in your bag.\nCheck this out: a nifty collapsible hanger for easy storage. \nAre you a road warrior? The TRIP option is the perfect travel companion for work or for adventure. It combines the backpack with a removable Tripcover, a clever and compact double-sided mobile wardrobe for organising your clothes and toiletries.\nThere are loads of hidden compartments--some you may not discover until your second or third trip!\nThe front side of the Tripcover features two large zip-around compartments, each with additional zip-pockets - perfect for stashing your socks and underwear.\nThe top large pocket of the Tripcover is designed to pack your clothes, like your jeans and t-shirts.\nIt also houses a detachable \u201cstink-proof\u201d water-repellent laundry bag, roomy enough to contain a small pile of soiled clothes.\nIn the lower pocket of the Tripcover, you will find the essential 'dopp-kit'. The hanging washbag has every pocket imaginable including a super-sneaky spot for your contact lens case (no more blind groping around a hotel bathroom).\nThe dopp-kit is designed to also fit in the 'duffle-style' outside pocket of the backpack --- you end up with more space in the Tripcover to pack clothes. And it gives you easier access to it at airport security or for in-flight use.\nThe back of the Tripcover opens like a suitcase and there\u2019s enough room in here for two or three shirts; there\u2019s even a pocket for your tie.\nThe first thing you\u2019ll notice inside is something you don\u2019t see anywhere in travel gear: a Shirtcover with a collar protector--that\u2019s right: no more crumpled collars. By the way, the Shirtcover was inspired by our co-founder, Curdegn\u2019s inability to fold a dress shirt. We know he\u2019s not alone in his exasperation. \nSo to the millions of \u201cfolding challenged\u201d out there: this one\u2019s for you:\nYou\u2019re all of these things: a career-driven professional, an adventure-seeking explorer, and a homebody who wants to relax in the park on a Sunday. For all of those aspects of you, we\u2019ve created the BIZ option: an all-rounder featuring the Slicks backpack, the Suitcover, and the Tripcover. \nWith BIZ, you are ready to configure your Slicks endlessly to adapt to your changing travel needs: business, leisure or commute.\nPLAY\n\nHere's a summary of all the four options that make up the Slicks Travel System:\nWe\u2019re pretty sure we could stop here and let you click that green button right there to get your sweet Kickstarter deal on a Slicks, but we want you to be absolutely certain that Slicks is going to make your life on the road more organized and stress-free.\nLet\u2019s hear some stories from people who\u2019ve gotten a chance to try out the Slicks Travel System. This is just a sampling of the rave reviews our test-nomads are sending back from the field.\nCheck out Peter. He was the first beta-user of a SLICKS Travel System (BIZ option), and for the past six months, he\u2019s been putting it through its paces in every travel scenario you can imagine. In fact, he lived out of the SLICKS as his only bag for a two-week trip through Europe!\nSay \u201cHi\u201d to Mathias. He literally wrote the book on bicycle commuting. He started cycling to lose weight: he started at 350 lbs and within a year, lost 150 lbs. His daily trip is 14 miles each way. Every day. Year-round. Through all weather. In Minnesota.\nMeet Kerry Hayes, editor and creator of airportlifestyle.com. She fell in love with travel so much that she married a commercial airline pilot. They both tried out the Slicks BIZ, and this is what they have to say:\nAs a token of our deep appreciation for choosing to pre-order your Slicks Travel System on Kickstarter and being uniquely patient to wait for it to be delivered, we have ensured that you'll benefit from MAJOR savings on our entire range.\nHere is a summary of the reward options you can choose from:\n  Full disclosure: \nAs in, when you think of Swiss people climbing and skiing Alpine mountains and making the world more efficient, more neutral, and more punctual\u2014we\u2019re totally those guys (okay, so we don\u2019t yodel. Otherwise\u2014Swiss through and through).\nThink Swiss Army Knife and CERN Large Hadron Collider: we have a national obsession with designing products that reflect and simplify the multifunctional and multidimensional nature of life. The Slicks Travel System is the natural evolutionary step in Swiss design.\nAs a product design house with engineers and industrial designers, we have over a decade of experience in designing and developing all things Swiss for our global partners. But that\u2019s not where we stop - we also actively project manage production and global shipping logistics with leading contract manufacturers in Asia from our branch office in Taiwan. \nSo we truly understand what it takes to scale up production and manage global logistics - we are not just a bunch of dorky designers. We\u2019re also a bunch of production geeks.\nWe designed, developed and engineered a little gadget called the World Travel Adapter Pro+ for our partner, SKROSS. It\u2019s the world\u2019s safest and most compact 3-pole outlet adapter that connects to all 2- and 3-pole devices in 150-plus countries worldwide. It\u2019s one of the most popular travel adapters globally and it won the prestigious Red Dot Design Award. It\u2019s an ultimate embodiment of everything that is clever from Switzerland. But enough bragging. \nSo we understand what it takes to design and produce a brilliant product that not only solves problems encountered by travelers, but we also know what it takes to create something that will sell like hotcakes. Compact, efficient, beautifully-designed Swiss hotcakes. (We call them crepes.) \nWhen our co-founder and lead designer, Remo, was a young Swissling in Industrial Design School back in 2004, he wanted to create a way to make hiking backpacks move more naturally with the human body. His patented design, the Flexible Link based backpack carrier, earned him an award in the prestigious Swiss National Design Competition: he used the prize money to start our product design and development company, FLINK in 2005 along with Curdegn, our CEO. \nWe later went on to create several backpack designs for German bike ergonomics manufacturer, ERGON and other global partners. In other words, designing backpacks is our passion.\nOh, right. In 2011, we created an early version of the Slicks backpack to solve a common problem for business professionals: creating a way to both carry a suit wrinkle-free and all their work stuff while commuting. So we came up with the first Slicks backpack with a suit protector insert. It proved to be very popular and got rave reviews from industry experts.\nAfter we started to use the original Slicks bag for activities like overnight travel or just walking around town, we realized there were more possibilities to explore. So we improved the overall design of the Slicks backpack and designed a series of modular inlays. The result was a pack that could go anywhere, for any purpose. Thus, the Slicks Travel System was born.\nAs mentioned above, being Swiss means we have a cultural imperative to be outdoorsy. We\u2019re mountain bikers and climbers (no kidding - that's really Remo pictured above!), we\u2019re skiers and snowboarders, we\u2019re avid travellers  and we\u2019re also parents and business owners. \nWhether we use them as a place to stash our gear, a change of clothes, spare diapers, or important business documents, backpacks go pretty much wherever we go. And we needed a backpack like Slicks Travel System to reflect our lifestyles, which are multifaceted.\nHere is the nitty gritty of the Slicks Travel System:\nFirst of all, you rock. We want you to know that.\nHere\u2019s the magic green button that will make our dreams a reality and your future travel experiences awesome. Click it.\nNow you\u2019re in for some fun. Once you pick your reward level, you\u2019ll be entered into our Slicks community. We\u2019ll send you campaign updates, product status checks, and love-notes just because.\nJust in case you missed something, as we tend to gush endlessly about the glory of the Slicks Travel System. As its creators, we simply can't help it. It\u2019s our baby.\nYes:\nThank you from the bottom of our hearts for coming this far with us on the journey to making Slicks a reality. Just the fact that you\u2019ve taken the time out of your busy internet-browsing schedule to check out our project means more to us than you can know. \nEven if you\u2019re just window-shopping, please: let your friends know about this amazing bag. If one of them becomes a Slicks user, they\u2019ll never stop thanking you AND you\u2019ll have a happier, less-stressed, well-traveled friend with loads of stories to tell about their journeys.\nFrom the Slicks team to you, may you always love your journey.\nThis project is promoted by Jellop, a direct\u00ad response online advertising agency specializing in Kickstarter campaigns on Facebook Ads and Google AdWords.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs with any journey, we can stumble upon unexpected events as we embark on the mission to produce and deliver you your Slicks Travel System.

Over the last decade, we have worked with them to design and produce several backpacks for our clients. We share a deep professional and personal relationship with the manufacturer. Curdegn\u2019s kids and the owner\u2019s kids play together when Curdegn travels with his family to head our office in Taiwan. So basically, we have a lot of history working with this world class manufacturer. They aren\u2019t going to let us down. \n\nComplexity of order fulfilment - Everyone knows that some Kickstarter projects have issues fulfilling pledges on time. Given our extensive experience with integrated product development, you\u2019re not going to have that problem with us: we have our manufacturing agreements in place, we have warehouses and logistical partnerships set up in the U.S., Central Europe, Hong Kong and Australia, and your Slicks bag will be ready to be produced & shipped once this project is funded.\n\nProduct adjustments - As we continue to test and trial the bags, we may need to make some small adjustments to improve the product. These will always be for the benefit of you, the user - and we'll let you know any time we improve something.\n\nCustoms - For backers in US, European Union, Switzerland & Australia, we will deliver your goods customs cleared, as we already have warehouse partnerships established in these regions.

We made a universal vehicle accessory that turns your smartphone into a Head-Up Display (HUD) bringing comfort and safety to drivers all over the world. We did it because we\u2019re tired of waiting for others. Because we believe that automotive HUDs are safer than an instrument-panel display or a smartphone. And because other solutions are either very expensive, or stuck in the midst of a long and complicated development process. This is the accessory we want, and we think you\u2019ll like it. It's simple and affordable. Discover a new way of using your phone while driving and not being distracted. Now we need your support to make HUDWAY Glass a reality. We hope you will join us! \nPLAY\n\nAs featured in:\nA universal accessory for your smartphone\nWe have been tirelessly working on improving safety and comfort of drivers while behind the wheel for over three years. We started with a phone app for iOS and Android, which has transformed our vision on how cell phones can be used in a car. By now, over one million drivers have tried our app, and we\u2019ve been frequently getting emails of appreciation from our customers. We even have an amazing story about how our app saved a life of one person.\nHUDWAY app was initially designed for use in low visibility conditions\nWe introduced the early prototype of HUDWAY Glass at CeBIT 2015 in Hannover for the first time. It is a simple accessory, which turns any smartphone into a head-up display. Moreover, it eliminates many issues associated with projecting an image onto a windshield, including doubling of the image, lack of reflection during daytime, image size and a few others. We received very positive response from potential customers, dealers and retailers, as well as from many major representatives of the automotive industry.\nSince then, we have improved our design, run a number of tests and completed production of our first sample batch of 100 devices. As such, all the photos on this page are real.\nIt is super easy to use HUDWAY Glass\nStep 1: Use any smartphone to start any app that supports HUD mode\nStep 2: Place your smartphone on a cradle with its display up \nStep 3: You are all set to go! \nWe recommend you start by using the following apps:\nHUDWAY app is our own app specifically designed to assist drivers when navigating in low visibility conditions on rural or remote roadways. Here is a demo video of the app https://vimeo.com/97818544 and a short promo https://vimeo.com/75947078\nSpeedometer app is our own app that alerts you when you are exceeding the speed limit for the given road. Will be available by November 2015 for iOS (Android \u2014 by the beginning of 2016).\nNavmii app is also offering good offline maps (worldwide) for navigation and neat info visualization in HUD mode. Get it from Apple AppStore and Google Play Market (World edition or US 50 states edition).  \nSygic is a navigation app offering global offline maps and supporting HUD mode.\nBaidu maps is the most popular navigation app for China, which supports HUD mode, too. \nYou can always find more apps by searching \u201cHUD\u201d in app stores: Apple App Store | Google Play Market\nApp stores have been showing a stable growth of the navigation and infotainment apps offering HUD (Head-Up Display) mode. Below is just a few of them, designed to reduce attention split and get all the navigation information right on the windshield. \nSee it in Action\nAvailable mounts\nThis video gives a 360\u00b0 answer to your questions about adhesives, glass angle adjustment, curved dashboards, etc...\nWill my phone fly off the cradle, if I brake abruptly?\nHere\u2019s a special video for that. Shake it!\nCan I perhaps watch video using HUDWAY Glass?\nWell, technically you can. Just make sure you\u2019re properly parked before you start.\nDoes it work with any app?\nYes, any app with HUD mode. Here is an example \u2014 Navmii app.\nThere are 600 million people in the world who get behind the wheel of a car every single day. According to the researches, approximately 75% of them get distracted while driving \u2014 it could be just drinking coffee, talking to a child in the back seat, reaching for the glove compartment, changing a radio station, and so on...  But the worst and most frequent distraction is our phone. \nWe are always on the phone. We talk, read, type, tweet, check and search... We do selfies and share pictures. We even do video conference calls while driving! This is especially dangerous when driving in low visibility conditions such as rain, fog, snow or just darkness... we are nearly driving blind and trying to multitask with checking directions on our smart phones. That is when bad things happen. Indeed, based on official reports, 22% of all auto accidents happen because of a driver multitasking and/or low visibility conditions \u2014 that is 750 deaths a day worldwide.  \nAutomakers are certainly aware of this problem and they are looking for solutions. One of them \u2014 head-up displays (HUDs) \u2014 can significantly improve the situation. With HUDs, drivers see information they need right on the windshield, which allows them to be totally focused on the road at all times. They no longer need to look away from the road to read dashboard information or check directions on the phone. It allows drivers to focus on the road, keep their hands on the wheel and mind on driving.\nToday, the market offers two main HUD options for cars:\nTo buy a new luxury car. There are more and more cars manufactured with built-in HUD displays. It is estimated that by 2020, 9% of all new cars will be equipped with HUD displays (currently it is just 4%). These HUDs have an excellent image quality and on-board computer integration. But they will cost you over $1,000 as an option.\nTo buy a portable HUD device. This is an aftermarket solution that can be purchased separately and simply placed before a driver\u2019s eyes on the dashboard. This kind of device is often equipped with a display (or pico projector), sensors, special optics, and wires to connect to the car or just for charging. Although much cheaper than factory HUDs, these devices still cost about $400. \nWe\u2019re offering an alternative to these options. We\u2019ve invented a car accessory for a smartphone that turns it into a head-up display. It contains no electronic components, and the phone is used as an image source \u2014 thus, we can make a HUD affordable for anyone. \nThe crux is in the glass. It\u2019s the main HUDWAY Glass component \u2014 a plastic lens, very lightweight and of low fragility, which means that cuts are unlikely even if it gets broken. The glass has an aspheric shape, which allows to get a 20% larger image while at the same time minimize spherical, comatic, and chromatic aberrations. In other words, when looking through the curved glass you still see the road as it is, with no distortions. \nBut there\u2019s more! A thin multilayered glass coating is a \u201csecret sauce\u201d of HUDWAY Glass \u2014 and its important feature. Its main purpose is to enhance the reflective properties of the glass and preserve its transparency, so that your view of the road is never obstructed.\nKnowing that all vehicles are different, we realized we couldn\u2019t offer a single universal mount to suit any car. Apart from variations in dashboard shapes and sizes, vehicles differ in drivers\u2019 seating position. Even your height matters as it dictates the angle in which you look at the road. \nAdjustable and compact mount\nWe made two simple dashboard mounts \u2014 one compact, the other \u2014 adjustable, allowing for a pretty wide range of the angle. Both mounts are equipped with magnets to firmly hold the cradle with your phone on it. At the same time, you can easily take it off the dashboard and place it back \u2014 even without looking.\nWe came to these design solutions after several tries of creating prototypes. Indeed, this is the best and most reliable way to thoroughly study any issue. We used home 3D printers for some of the intermediate prototypes. However, all major modifications were tested on the prototypes produced by  industrial printers. It allowed for excellent printing quality and accuracy \u2014 the prototypes margin of error against CAD blueprints was within 0.1%.\nA special app for iOS and Android\nSpecifically for our backers, we\u2019re developing an app with 6 screen options to use in head-up display mode \u2014 from a retro speedometer to a virtual bobble-head dog.\nA special app (HUDWAY Glass Kickstarter edition app for iOS and Android).\nOne-year advertisement on the rally car\nAs we\u2019ve mentioned, our co-founder Alex is a professional rally driver. His car is taking part in Europe Rally Championship 2016. It is a very big event well covered by the media. Here\u2019s the list of tracks where the car will surely perform (more tracks may be added later):\nJanuary 2016: International J\u00e4nnerrallye, Austria \nFebruary 2016: Rally Liep\u0101ja, Latvia \nJune 2016: Kenotek Ypres, Belgium \nJuly 2016: auto24 Rally Estonia, Estonia \nAugust 2016: Barum Czech Rally Zlin, Czech Republic\nWe\u2019ll place your ad right on the car (placement area is 5x5 inches or 13x13 cm; the car design may change). This is how it will look:\nYour proposed ad contents may be edited to ensure compliance with the laws and regulations on advertising in effect in the above-mentioned countries. \nWe\u2019ll contact you directly to get your placement materials after we successfully finish the campaign.\nHUDWAY team gear\nShare the team feeling \u2014 get a great HUDWAY hoodie and a t-shirt. We\u2019ll contact backers directly to get their sizes.\nNavigation systems available today are still proving to be unsafe, diverting driver attention and focus away from the most important task in driving \u2013 eyes on the road. Current navigation systems require that drivers read and interpret data and/or listen to audio commands which has been shown to take an average time of 5 seconds for a typical adult driver. Not surprising, it is 3 seconds more than what is considered a \u201csafe-time\u201d by various safety studies.\nKeeping in line with proven safety studies by NASA and other government-sponsored research on driver safety technology, head-up display (HUD) based navigation technology has quickly become safer and more effective road guidance method. HUD navigation keeps drivers' visual attention on the road while being guided. It also eliminates auditory distraction, which can force a driver to shift attention from paying attention to visual cues to simply listening to directions and back, a proven distraction factor. In short, HUD-based systems can be much more intuitive in delivering navigational information than the traditional displays while keeping the driver safe.\nReferences: \n\"The Relative Frequency Of Unsafe Driving Acts In Serious Traffic Crashes\" D.

In 2004, combining their skills and experience in sales, product development and engineering, they decided to join their passions and start their own IT company, operating worldwide. This company has since launched a dozen of successful products on the market. \nAlex and Ivan \u2014 co-founders of the project\nIvan and Alex got their MBA degrees in 2013 from College of Business, University of Louisville, KY, USA. The HUDWAY project was born as their graduate qualification work.\nThe idea came from Alex\u2019s professional hobby \u2014 rally racing. In rally, they have co-pilots for efficient navigation. But co-pilots are humans who can naturally make mistakes. Thus, for a stronger confidence, some additional cues would be helpful to pilots to verify the next maneuver. And when driving along a narrow forest track at 100 mph, pilots have absolutely no time to get distracted by navigation monitors.\nRally racers may drive like crazy \u2014 yes! But these guys are true experts in driving safety.\nFirst, we\u2019ve developed an app for navigation in poor visibility conditions (hudwayapp.com) \u2014 and over one million people have tried it by now. This inspired us to start a new beginning \u2014 accessory production. In 2015, we\u2019ve gone a long way from a mere idea to the first real samples that people are using already.  \nAnd it wouldn\u2019t have happened without our united team, where each person is a great specialist and a devoted teammate. We are proud of them, and would like to thank everyone for their solid work, commitment, and loyalty. \nFor press inquiries, please email us at press@hudwayapp.com\nYou can also download the press kit with hi-res photos (zip, 162 Mb).\nJoin our Facebook page: facebook.com/hudwayapp\nFollow us on Twitter: twitter.com/hudwayapp\nVimeo video channel: vimeo.com/hudway\nFollow our moments: instagram.com/hudwaymoments\nFor more information check out our blog: hudwayapp.com/posts ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe\u2019ve been in software development for more than 12 years.

Its military-grade locking system ensures it stays permanently on your handlebar to assist you when you need it. The intuitive navigation system shows you the quickest, safest routes to your destination. Automatic tracking capabilities save your biking metrics seamlessly. The powerful front light illuminates your path at night. And when you\u2019re not around, SmartHalo keeps your bike safe from thieves. This is the smart biking system you\u2019ve been waiting for.\nSmartHalo finds the quickest, safest routes to make your ride a stress-free experience. Input the destination on your smartphone, tuck it safely in your pocket and let SmartHalo take care of the rest. Get turn-by-turn navigation straight on your handlebars...a bike GPS communicated through an intuitive light halo. Alleluia.\nA right turn\nUnlike regular fitness apps, there is no need to press \u201cstart\u201d or \u201cstop\u201d \u2013 SmartHalo tracks your progress as soon as you start pedalling. Get extensive metrics and visualize the data in the app.\nNight lights get lost, stolen and fail on us \u2013 that is unacceptable. SmartHalo stays permanently on your bike with tamper-proof screws.You never have to worry about biking in the dark again. You don't even need to think about turning the light on or off. SmartHalo does it for you.\nSmartHalo's night light shuts down on its own.\nCyclists miss important notifications all the time, because street noise and road vibration make them hard to notice. Introducing your personal biking assistant.\nLet's put an end to bike theft. SmartHalo\u2019s internal motion sensor makes sure that any persistent meddling with your sacred two-wheeler triggers an alarm. Thieves be warned.\nBike Defender in action\nSince SmartHalo recognizes your phone, it deactivates as soon as you approach your bike. Seamless technology. \nDESIGN\nSmartHalo\u2019s design philosophy is centered on simplicity. Biking in cities can be a challenge, so we\u2019ve made sure our device was simple to use, yet smart. How? By reducing its interface to its simplest possible form \u2013 a circle.\nOne of our biggest challenge was to make sure SmartHalo would fit any bike, right in the center of the handlebar. After months of sketching and modeling, we found an elegant, durable and minimalist solution.\nHave you ever seen a car driver remove its headlights after parking? Neither have we. Why should bikers have to remove their accessories after each ride? We designed SmartHalo to install permanently on your bike while making sure it doesn't get stolen \u2013 it will withstand the world\u2019s harshest urban environments. Its unique, military-grade locking system ensures it stays on your bike to assist you when you need it.\nAPP\nIt's so simple anyone could use it. We don\u2019t want our users browsing endless menus \u2013 we want them biking. We\u2019ve spent countless hours testing this interface and success will be measured by how little time it takes to get you going.\nTECHNOLOGY\nWe designed SmartHalo to be beautiful inside and out. There is no on/off button \u2013 its sophisticated sensors detect your presence. When you finish your ride, it automatically shuts down. This leads to amazing battery life, to keep going as long as you do. Under standard usage, SmartHalo will last around three weeks.\nPERKS\nSTRETCH GOALS\nTIMELINE\nABOUT US\nWe believe that technology should not be something you have to worry about \u2013 it should just work. We're urban cyclists who wanted to deal with the main problems of biking in cities: navigation and security. We found that the existing solutions right now were just not suited for harsh urban environments. They fall in two main categories:\nBike accessories and gadgets that need to be removed after each ride, stuffed with energy-intensive screens and awkward maps;\nFancy (and expensive) smart bikes that are attractive to thieves and require you to replace your existing ride. \nThis is why we created SmartHalo. We built something that fits on any bicycle, is durable, tamper-proof and intuitive to use. \nThis project is promoted by Jellop, a direct\u00ad response online advertising agency specializing in Kickstarter campaigns on Facebook Ads and Google AdWords.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOk, hardware is hard and our project, ambitious \u2013 we need to get design, software, electronics, suppliers and financing right.

That's tough. \nWe want a reliable solution, and the Candle Charger is the first indoor generator designed to charge smartphones and keep them charged.\nThe Candle Charger is a safe, miniature power plant that provides on-demand electricity when the grid can't. It's power we control, anywhere we need it - indoors or out, day or night, grid or no grid. \nWe also offer the Candle Charger in the Stower P.O.P. Kit! P.O.P = Power Outage Prepared, a necessary update for home readiness. \nThanks to our amazing community of Kickstarter supporters (thank you! thank you! thank you!), we raised enough money to manufacture and ship our first product, the FlameStower - its now for sale across the US and Canada.\nThe FlameStower is portable power for campers. Based on your invaluable feedback and our own experiences we needed to design a power generator - elegant and simple - to work inside the home during blackouts.\nThe Candle Charger fits in existing emergency kits and works readily with common household items: candles and water.\nWith your help, we want to make the Candle Charger a reality and modernize power outage readiness. We hope you'll join us and Get Charged!\nThe Candle Charger uses the heat energy from candles to generate electricity. \nOpening the handle\nLocking into place\nBonus!

Buy one, give one - excited to try this exclusively on Kickstarter and see what we can do!\nStower is a leader in personal energy product engineering and design. Together with our manufacturing partner PCH, Stower makes smart, reliable energy products that 1) do their job and 2) do it well.\nThe Candle Charger contains two core pieces of technology: \nA thermoelectric module, also known as a Peltier cooler. Thermoelectric modules are semiconductor devices that convert temperature gradients \u2013 one side hot, one side cold \u2013 into electricity. The Candle Charger uses nontoxic bismuth telluride-based modules, which have been in mass production for over twenty years for scientific, refrigeration, and automotive industries. \nThe Stower smart circuit that conditions the power coming from the module to match power requirements of the device being charged (e.g. a smartphone). \nWhat makes the Candle Charger an important innovation is the conversion efficiency of the device, its electrical strategy, and the focus on design for indoor use. \nConversion Efficiency\nThe Candle Charger achieves class-leading power output from thermoelectric modules, providing reliable USB power over extended periods of operation. We do this through a combination of patented mechanical engineering steps to optimize heat transfer from the candle, to the thermoelectric module, and into the water bath; careful control over thermal interfaces; and spatial design to position the Candle Charger relative to a heat source (i.e. the candle).\nElectrical Strategy \nTo increase cost savings and overall efficiency, Stower directly charges your electronic devices rather than charge an intermediate battery. We\u2019re able to do this through circuitry developed exclusively for Stower products that\ncontinually monitors the power output from the thermoelectric generator,\nboosts the voltage to USB standard 5V,\nconditions the power from the generator so it matches internal charging requirements of smartphones, switching between \u201cbands\u201d of acceptable current levels and gradually dropping the voltage so phones don\u2019t drop the charge,\nprovides LED indicator sequences to clearly show power availability \u2013 a flashing light means power is available, while a stead light means steady power is achieved and the power output is \u201ciPhone ready.\u201d \nDesigned for Indoor Use\nWe began with energy - the candle - and built the Candle Charger from there. The Candle Charger is sturdy enough to work outdoors, but its sleek design fits in with other beautiful shelf items for in-home storage and use. \nThe handle and locking mechanism are necessary features that provide safe interface with the water bath during operation and collapsability for anywhere storage. The all-aluminum exterior - designed for maximum thermal efficiency - lends a modern look while being durable enough to take outdoors.\n Stower's been a hard charging machine since our birth in 2012.\nStower is led by Andy, Adam, and Jason. Andy and Adam met in grad school studying materials science. Both were obsessed with solar technologies and nanomaterials - so much so that Adam once illicitly snuck Andy into the campus nanofab, bunny suits and all, to help characterize sapphire wafers. STOWER GONE WILD!\nWe're also lucky enough to work with some extremely talented advisors and partners that help make Stower a reality, including:\nDr. Reza Kassayan - our world-class electrical engineer and advisor\nPCH - our supply chain, design, and manufacturing partners\nREI, Sportsman's Warehouse, FGL Sports in Canada, and other retail partners who've helped deliver our first product nationwide.\nStanford, StartX, and Orange Fab - hundreds of folks who support and help us make new energy innovations. \nStower builds energy products for individuals, making it easier and more efficient to generate and control our own electricity. Smartphones are amazing machines: Stower chargers keep these powered when the grid can't. \nWith this technology, Stower is also introducing electricity to thousands of homes in emerging markets.

We had a few challenges before, but we've demonstrated that we know how to source product and get it into the hands of our Backers as quickly as possible. Rest assured, we're not going to waste your money buying big fancy machines or paying rent on factory / store space.\nWhat's new in this campaign:\nWe've come back to Kickstarter! Bringing new models to market is a very expensive process. We invested almost all the profits from the first campaign to cover our R&D costs for these new models \u2013 now, we just need your help so we can afford to order productions runs and launch 3 new DM1 models:\nDM1 Nickel \u2013 starts life as a solid billet of 6061-T6 aircraft-grade aluminum. It is machined into the perfect shape to retain your cards with a positive click. It is then hand-buffed to a mirror polish. Finally, it Nickel plated in a 17-step process to give a hard protective finish that looks like Sterling Silver and will not tarnish. Available in 3 sizes: 4-card / 8-card / 12-card\nDM1 Titanium \u2013 also machined from a solid billet of metal, but this model is made from G2 99.5% pure titanium. Titanium is known as the Metal of the Gods because of its corrosion resistance and highest strength-to-density ratio of any metallic element on the periodic table. It is so beautiful, we leave it with the raw machined finish. Although slightly heavier than the original, DM1 Titanium is our strongest / sturdiest model. Available in 3 sizes: 4-card / 8-card / 12-card\nDM1 Carbon Fiber \u2013 we start with a custom manufactured solid plate of Carbon Fiber, then machine it the same way we make our metal versions. It is about half the weight of the Aluminum model! Available in 3 sizes: 4-card / 8-card / 12-card\nLate last year, we launched the DM1 wallet Kickstarter campaign. You can see our original campaign here. We shipped 2,000+ wallets to more than 1,300 backers. We shipped nearly 90% of our rewards within 30 days of the end of our last campaign.\nDM1 Customers around the world!\nSince then, we continued to grow \u2013 we now sell the original DM1 Aluminum models on our own website, Amazon, Etsy and Touch of Modern. To date, we've shipped over 5,000 wallets to 49 United States and 51 countries around the world.\nPurely Functional:\nThe DM1 is a truly minimalist design \u2013 it\u2019s a single piece of aluminum, cut into the ideal shape to positively retain up to 8 identification or credit cards. The design eliminates unnecessary parts, but securely and beautifully carries and protects your cards.\nIt does NOT block RFID \u2013 so you can use building access cards and contact-less RFID credit cards without removing them from the DM1. The open front and back are ideal for photo ID cards like a drivers license.\nDM1 Nickel (8-card) weighs 0.8 oz (22 grams) \u2013 about the same as 4 credit cards.\nAt only 3.53\u201d x 2.38\u201d x 0.36\u201d, the 8-card model is thinner than an iPhone 4 and just barely larger than a credit card.\nHow we got to Kickstarter:\nWhile I was at Stanford University, I took a Mechanical Engineering class that encouraged students to solve real world problems. I recalled issues with back pain caused by carrying a thick leather wallet in his back pocket. Carrying his wallet in his front pocket solved this problem, but was thick, bulky and uncomfortable.\nMuch slimmer and smaller than leather wallets\nI set out to design the ultimate minimalist wallet. I wanted something thin, small and a joy to carry \u2013 but also a design that could carry all essential credit and ID cards. I was not satisfied with other so-called minimalist wallets \u2013 the idea of taking a beautifully machined metal wallet and pairing it with elastic straps, velcro or rubber bands was offensive to me. The new design would have to avoid using any unnecessary parts, velcro, rubber bands, screws, rivets, hinges, magnets or clasps.\nDM1 Titanium 8-card Prototype from March 2015\nThe Utility Patent application was filed in August 2014 \u2013 so the DM1 is guaranteed to be a truly unique design!\nDM1 Nickel \u2013 Machined from a solid aluminum billet\nDM1 Nickel \u2013 hewn from a solid billet of 6061-T6 aircraft-grade aluminum. Although it is feather-light, it feels cool, strong and substantial in-hand. The chamfered edges and smooth corners make for a comfortable and slim pocket. The rounded detents secure your cards in place with a positive click. The mirror-finish Nickel plating looks like Sterling Silver but is as durable as the Hard Anodized finishes on the original DM1 models. \nDM1 Titanium - Metal of the Gods\nDM1 Titanium \u2013 our new flagship model. Unlike Aluminum, which needs a protective coating, Titanium is very hard and corrosion resistant. But the strength of Titanium has a downside \u2013 it is extremely difficult to work with. It takes nearly 2 hours of meticulous CNC machining to sculpt the DM1 out of a solid billet of G2 \"Commercially Pure\" Titanium. Titanium also has the benefit of being highly corrosion resistant and hypoallergenic.\nDM1 Carbon Fiber \u2013 Made from custom carbon fiber plate\nDM1 Carbon Fiber \u2013 the exotic super-car of the Decadent Minimalist family. This model is half the weight of the original DM1 Aluminum models. Some might think it impossibly light \u2013 but that is the magic of carbon fiber. The unmistakable sheen of twill fabric can be seen just below the clearcoat layer. \nCNC Precision Machined \u2013 To create a finished product that meets your expectations for quality, the DM1 is precision made with CNC (computer numerical control) milling machines. Every surface is milled with a \u00b10.002\u201d (two-thousandths of an inch) tolerance \u2013 ensuring that your cards snap into place and are securely held every time.\nThe edges are chamfered for a smooth pocket feel. The corners are rounded so it never snags.\nThe DM1 design embraces the philosophy that form should follow function. The DM1 has been pared down to the absolute minimum amount of material to still effectively do its job. Fortunately, this results in a wallet that is an absolute joy to carry as you'll soon forget you even have it in your pocket.\nDM1: CAD Modeled in SolidWorks\n Specifications: (8-card Nickel model)\nCapacity: 1 \u2013 8 cards \u2013 2 cards externally visible\nRetention: Cards secured by 2 detents\nWeight: 0.8 ounces (8-card Nickel model = 22 grams)\nWeight: 1.0 ounces (8-card Titanium model = 29 grams)\nLength: 3.53\u201d\nWidth: 2.38\u201d\nThickness: 0.36\u201d\n GeekBeat TV:\nPLAY\n\n John P: \"...It's the only thing I carry...\"\nPLAY\n\n As seen on Gear Hungry:\nAnd The Gadgeteer!\nRoy's awesome review on BestSlimWallet.com!\nThe Slim Wallet Junkie loves the design!\nErik was interviewed on the Crowdfund Nation Podcast!\nQ: I would like to add custom engraving to my pledge \u2013 but I don't need the full Luxury Pack.

The Carbon Fiber cannot be engraved using that method and we don't have access to a CNC router that can cut Carbon Fiber. \nQ: Do I need to remove the DMC Money Clip to insert / remove credit cards from the DM1 Wallet?\nA: Nope! The DMC has an access notch so you can easily grasp even the card directly behind the I'll post a video showing this soon.\nQ: What if I don't normally carry 8 cards? Will fewer cards still be held securely?\nA: Yes! All three sizes (even the 12-card model) will hold a single card safely. With the 8- and 12-card models, if you have fewer than 4 cards inserted, you may hear them moving around inside, but they won't fall out.\nQ: How thick are the 4-card and 12-card models?\nA: The 4-card is 0.23\" and the 12-card is 0.51\" thick. The Carbon fiber model is undergoing one additional prototype to test this, so I don't have the exact figures, but expect about 0.01 to 0.02\" thicker.\nOur commitment: First and foremost, we commit to you that stretch goals WILL NOT impact shipping times of orders for DM1 Nickel and DM1 Titanium (8 card) models. We will not sacrifice shipping times for the stretch goal options. But for those of you who really want the stretch goal versions, we will do our best to fulfill these orders by October 2015.\nStretch Goal #1: > $10,000 \u2013 at this level, we will add a 4-card model and a 12-card model for all three sizes. The only difference should be thickness. We should be able to ship the first few hundred of the 4-card and 12-card versions in late-September. UNLOCKED!\nStretch Goal #2: > $120,000 \u2013 at this level, we will add a Stonewashed finish to the DM1 Titanium. UNLOCKED!\nStretch Goal #2.5: > $200,000 \u2013 at this level, all DMC Money Clip backers will receive the improved DMC v2 design instead of the original DMC v1. UNLOCKED!\nStretch Goal #3: > $250,000 \u2013 at this level, we will introduce an RFID / NFC attenuating card option. UNLOCKED!\nStretch Goal #4: > $350,000 \u2013 at this level, we will introduce the Titanium Black coating for DM1 Titanium. UNLOCKED!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nFirst of all \u2013 just as with our previous campaign, I commit to you that I will post frequent and regular updates, both to Kickstarter as well as my blog to keep you updated.\n\nTo reduce risk, Decadent Minimalist is working with multiple proven machine shops and metal finishers.

Then it will have  a lot neat look.)\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\u2022Thin, Light, Fast: With Solar Paper we\u2019re making the thinnest and lightest solar charger that can reliably charge your smartphone in about 2.5 hours on a sunny day. That\u2019s about the same as a wall charger.\n\u2022Goes Anywhere: Solar Paper is so lightweight that outdoorsy types can clip it to a backpack and charge while hiking. Urban adventurers can easily slip it into a jacket pocket or notebook.\n\u2022Reliable and Easy to Use: Most solar chargers shut down and need to be manually reset after a cloud passes overhead and the voltage drops. Solar Paper automatically resets itself so you can keep charging, hassle free.\n\u2022Expands with Magnets: The basic 5 watt Solar Paper can charge your smartphone on a sunny day. If you need more power to charge a tablet, or to charge on a cloudy day, you can click new magnetic panels into place.\n\u2022From the same team that brought you SOLARADE, backed by 1,025 people in 2014.\nCurrent Status\n\u2022For the first batch, which we plan to ship in September 2015, we\u2019ve already ordered all the components except for the solar panels.\nCharge Anywhere Under the Sun\n         For Solar Paper, we\u2019re manufacturing the latest and most efficient solar panel. Because of this, Solar Paper is the world\u2019s smallest solar charger for the amount of potential wattage it can generate.\nAs part of this campaign, we\u2019re offering 5 watt, 7.5 watt and 10 watt chargers, with 2, 3 or 4 panels, respectively. In bright sunlight, the 5 watt charger can fully charge an iPhone 6 in about 2.5 hours, which is similar to a wall charger. For more powerful devices like tablets or cameras, or for faster charging, you\u2019ll want to opt for one of the higher-wattage versions. (There\u2019s a handy guide further down this page to help you pick the right one.)\n*We extended the Max power from 10W(4 panels in total) to 15W.(6panels in total)\nPaper thin & ultra lightweight, Solar Paper is just 0.15-inch thin and 4 oz.\nSlip Solar Paper inside a notebook or planner\nHanging Solar Paper on a backpack\nSolar Paper can recharge any device that charges using a USB cable\nCompatible Devices\nSolar paper can charge almost any device that recharges via USB, including, smartphones, tablets, walkie talkies, flashlights, portable game consoles, cameras, video cameras, and rechargeable batteries. (Refer to the handy guide further down the page to help you pick the right wattage for your devices.)\nSize & weight comparison\nThin, Lightweight and Durable\nSolar Paper measures just 9 x 19 x 1.1 cm when folded, and each panel weighs only 65~75 (2.5 oz). Watt-for-watt, it is 70 percent smaller and lighter than our closest competitor. Most importantly, Solar Paper is just 1.1 cm deep, at its thickest point, compared to 3.8 cm for our competitor, easy to carry it!\nSolar Paper with currencies from several countries.\nSolar Paper is water resistant\nEmbedded magnets let you easily add or subtract Solar Paper\u2019s solar panels.\nEasily Expandible Using Magnets\nWe wanted to make Solar Paper as compact as possible and also allow you to expand it in the future if you need to charge larger devices. Our design solution was to create a set of folding solar panels held together using strong magnets with silicon connectors. Only need two panels and want to save some weight? No problem. Just bought a tablet and need more wattage to charge it? Also not a problem.\nUse Solar Paper's embedded magnets to attach it to metal surfaces.\nThere are a couple of other advantages of using magnets in Solar Paper, too. First, there\u2019s no wear and tear on seams when you fold or unfold the panels, greatly extending Solar Paper\u2019s life. The magnets are also quite strong, so you can use them to mount Solar Paper to metal objects, as shown in the picture.\nAuto reset technology\nSet it and Forget It\nUnlike other simple devices with a battery, smart devices like smart-phones and tablets would not accept low current caused by insufficient sunlight. In this case, devices have to be manually reset. That means that users have to unplug and replug the cable every time a cloud passes overhead or you walk through a shadow. This is very inconvenient.\nWe wanted to make Solar Paper as easy as possible for anyone to use, so we have integrated \u2018auto-comparison technology\u2019 into the charger, to make it automatically resume powering your devices, after the sun starts soaking it again.\nDisplay exact load current so you know the power amount that Solar Paper is generating in real time.\nGeek Out with Real Time Readings\nBackers from our first solar project, Solarade, suggested that we find a way to show how much solar energy the panel is generating in real time. We thought this was a great idea, because, in addition to being very cool, it would let you see how the panel performs under different weather conditions.\nFor Solar Paper, we\u2019ve included an LCD amp meter that shows exactly how much current is flowing from the charger to your device at any time. We wouldn\u2019t include this  LCD if we were not absolutely confident about our technology and our product. No false advertising. No false promises.\n Please help us hit our fourth $1,000,000 stretch goal, so we can throw in 4carabiners, a pouch and a micro USB cable and something more.\nPicking the Right Wattage\nWe\u2019re offering Solar Paper in three versions:\n5 Watt (2 panels)\n7.5 Watt (3 panels)\n10 Watt (4 panels)\nYou\u2019ll want to pick the right one so you\u2019ll have ample power to charge your devices. We\u2019ve put together a quick guide to help you decide.\nQuestion 1: What\u2019s the biggest thing I want to charge?\nSmartphones need less power than tablets and most video cameras in order to charge. You can find out how much power your device needs to charge by checking your existing wall charger.\n5V * 1A = 5 Watts\nThe charger that comes with popular smartphones like the iPhone and Galaxy S, are 5 volts, 1 amp. Just multiply these numbers to get the watts you need:\n5V * 1.5A = 7.5Watts\nSome larger phones like the iPhone 6+ and Galaxy Note come with a higher powered wall chargers.  10Watt will charge devices quickly and stable, but 7.5Watts will be more cost effective if you live in a place with strong sun light.\n5V * 2A = 10 Watts\nCharging Tablet like iPad, Galaxy Tab. In this case, you can go with the 10 watt version of Solar Paper.\nIf you\u2019re charging a device that isn\u2019t \u201csmart\u201d, like a flashlight or Bluetooth speaker, you can use any version of Solar Paper. Higher watts means faster charging.\nQuestion 2: How\u2019s the weather?\nSolar Paper, like all solar panels works best in direct sunlight. If you live somewhere cloudy, (indoor artificial light will generate power, but it isn\u2019t enough to charge devices like smartphones at all), you\u2019ll want a higher wattage version to charge stably and quickly.\nMany \u201csmart\u201d devices like smartphones and tablets won\u2019t accept low power(250mA for 5W smartphones, 750mA for 10W tablets). This could happen if you\u2019re charging on cloudy days or close to sunset, and your device will display an error message like: \u201cThis accessory is not supported.\u201d If you\u2019ll regularly charge in less than full sunlight, consider buying the 7.5 watt or 10 watt Solar Paper, rather than the 5 watt.\nQuestion 3: Am I in a hurry?\nHigher watts generally means faster charging, and this is especially true when you don\u2019t have direct sunlight. The 10 watt Solar Paper has twice the potential power output of the 5 watt version.\nMission of YOLK:\nAfter the following success of the Solarade, I established a solar company and named it YOLK. It reflects our desire to supply solar energy to electronic devices as yolk does to the fetuses. Our mission isto bring this wonderful green technology to more people. I wish YOLK can be a bridge between solar energy and people, including not only campers and hikers or early adopters but many others who face battery problems in their everyday lives. I believe that solar technology can relieve the battery problem we face and contribute to making the world greener.\nYOLK's solar modules\nYOLK is a solar company specialized in high quality solar modules and panels. While we produce our own products like Solarade(2014) and Solar Paper(2015). We also supplied customized solar modules on client\u2019s demands. Solar modules are mainly used for iot & ict devices.\nYolk team\nAfter graduating from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago with BFA emphasis in design object, I have created nolla design studio to continue doing what I love and do best: making things. After the first solar charger project, Solarade, I was attracted by the synergy of technology and design. So I founded a solar charger company, YOLK. YOLK is a small company for now, but this team has the world's top solar techonology and a vision to spread this wonderful green technology to everyone's daily life. You will find the most innovative and advanced solar products at YOLK.\nSam Lim has been working in power industry for over 18 years and solar industry for 7 years. He has numerous patents and a wide arrange of experiences with developing power products.\nPrevious KickStarter Solar project was done by my personal KickStarter account in 2014.

The additional funding will give us the budget we need to film time-lapse of mycelium, giving the perspective of lifting up the forest floor to reveal the mysteries of this underground network. \nAn all-star team of artists, scientists, doctors and explorers are joining forces to create a life-affirming, mind-bending film about the mushroom and its mysterious root-like structure: mycelium. What they reveal will blow your mind, and possibly save the planet. Join us in this Year of Soils (as declared by the United Nations) to learn more about this critical solution for climate change.\nHere's Louie Schwartzberg and Paul Stamets discussing the film:\nFantastic Fungi is an important scientific exploration and visual journey through the exotic, little-known realm of fungi, directed by Louie Schwartzberg, an award-winning master of nature imagery, special-effects cinematography and storytelling that is both informative and inspiring.\nWe begin with our cameras exploring a vast and startling realm. We discover fungi\u2019s enormity; the largest organism on the planet is a 2,200+ acre mycelium fungal mat more than two thousand years old! We experience their beauty; our cameras capture jewel-like mushrooms in countless shapes and in brilliant colors, from pink and yellow to turquoise. And, ultimately, we realize fungi\u2019s potential; the film takes us on a journey that reveals mycelium as the key to the regeneration of our living planet.\nMesmerizing time-lapse imagery reveals their remarkable toughness, as mushrooms power up through dead wood and stone-hard asphalt. As we watch fungi turn solid rock into soil, we grasp a key mechanism of life on Earth: fungi are not just decomposers, but composers continually producing the ingredients of new life, sustaining our ecosystem.\nBut these small, mighty miracles don\u2019t stop there. The complex chemistry of mycelium produces antibiotics powerful enough to prevent many diseases and to stop pandemics, even an E.coli or smallpox attack by terrorists. Legendary researcher Paul Stamets explains, \u201cOur strongest existing antibiotics come from fungi. They fight off the same microbes we do with defenses we can use.\u201d\nPaul goes on to explain that expanding fungi-generated soils around the world could absorb vast amounts of carbon dioxide and help control climate change. These organisms can be fantastic allies in our efforts to protect ourselves and to rejuvenate our entire ecosphere.\nYES! An artistically-shot, scientifically-sound, life-affirming film about mycelium: the incredible, intelligent network under our feet that has the proven ability to restore our ecosystem, repair our health, and resurrect our symbiotic relationship to nature. Fantastic Fungi aspires to be an educational, inspirational, and ultimately critical film that explores the uses and benefits of fungi in three critical areas.\nFirst, we uncover the research that shows mycelium as a viable alternative to western pharmacology, including treatment for breast cancer, Alzheimer's disease, and PTSD. Second, we reveal studies that point to mycelium as a solution to our gravest environmental challenges, such as toxic oil spills and colony collapse disorder. Finally, we marvel at mycelium's proven benefit on shifting consciousness and aiding in deep personal transformation. The research, discoveries, and anecdotal evidence we've gathered is astounding, particularly when shared through Louie\u2019s visual storytelling.\nHere's a sneak peak of our movie poster. Special thank you to Marianna Armata's photography. (Ooohhhh and aaaaahs are totally appropriate):\nYou\u2019re a filmmaker and you have a Hollywood producer? Why are you doing a Kickstarter campaign?\nSimply put, big studios won\u2019t make the film that needs to be made, can\u2019t tell the story that needs to be told and aren't bold enough to create the change necessary to shift our climate and consciousness. Through Kickstarter, we can reach engaged citizens like you who are motivated to create meaningful change and who want to be a part of this revolution. When you vote with your dollar, you send a message about what you value. This is how we ignite meaningful change.\nMushrooms are mighty miracles that deserve a mighty film - a film that can only be told from the front lines, from the doctors, scientists, and artists who have learned the language of nature. Together we can create the shift in consciousness needed to restore our planet.\nLouie Schwartzberg (Director, Cinematographer), brought you Wings of Life, a Disneynature film about pollination narrated by Meryl Streep, the 3D IMAX Mysteries of the Unseen World currently playing worldwide in collaboration with National Geographic and narrated by Forest Whitaker, and the ground-breaking Ultra HD nature series, Moving Art, on Netflix.

You all know how to make a gal feel loved.\nThere is still so much you can do to help.\n1. Share my Kickstarter link on all you social media outlets. \n2. Keep sharing your ideas for rewards with me. \n3. Back my rewards such as:\n*Sing background vocals on my record. You will be listed in the album's liner notes as back up vocalist.\n*House concert-. This is a fun reward you can split with 20 your friends.\n*Skype with me- you know my story and I'd love to hear yours. Or we can talk about music, motherhood, pop culture.\n*Come to NYC and we can do dinner and see a Broadway show.\n*Be a guest at my album pre release party in NYC. Be the first to hear the record and we can celebrate! \n * Lunch with me in Nashville, TN during 2015 CMA Fest. \n * Dinner with me in NYC!\nAt any time during the life of this campaign, you can increase your original bid.\nIf you have questions please message me through Kickstarter and I or someone in my team will get back with you ASAP. \nAs I prepare to record a new album, I'm going through piles of songs that I've written. Here's a live recording of a song that I wrote for my wife, Lauren. I got the title from the inscription that I'd had engraved inside Lauren's wedding band. That's what inspired me to write the song. Who knows, maybe this one will end up on my new record.\nListen to live version of \"I Am Yours Forever\" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKOug6la__c\nI can't thank you enough for making this happen for me. Let's make our goal so I can make this album! \n xo c\nVideo Update #1 - We're HALF WAY THERE!\nPLAY\n\n  My last album, Lifted Off The Ground was released 2010. It was also the year that my memoir Like Me was released and the year that I came out of the closet. So much has happened since then.\nI got legally married in 2011 and in 2013, my wife Lauren and I doubled the size of our family by having identical twin boys\u2014Everett and George. They\u2019re fifteen months old and doing great. \nHopefully, you viewed the video above in which I share what I\u2019ve got planned for the rest of 2014 and 2015.\nI\u2019ve been writing a lot of songs in the past few years and I'm ready to start recording my next album. I need your help.\nWe\u2019re officially kicking off my Kickstarter Campaign. I will make a record in the same way I\u2019ve always made records\u2014using the best musicians, the best engineers and recording in the best studios available. The only difference this time around is that we are choosing to harness the \u201cpower of the people\u201d to fund my album.\nFor my past couple of releases, the budget for simply producing and manufacturing my records has been around $200,000. And then, the record label invests hundreds of thousands more in marketing and promotion. When I was on major labels, these dollar amounts were nearly doubled.\nSo what I\u2019m saying is that I want to make a great album of great songs and to do that, we need to reach our goal.\nStretch Goal of $200,000. If we raise more than our goal, we can keep going!  If we reach our Stretch Goal, all that we raise will go toward marketing and promotion, original video content and tour support. This tour support will allow me to do shows in more places and that means I\u2019ll get to meet you out there on the road. All of the funds we raise will go right back into engaging with you, the fans. \nI think we\u2019ve compiled a cool list of items and experiences to fund this project. Check them out. I\u2019m particularly eager to ride bikes with you, go to Broadway shows with you and to co-write a song with you. Also, the house concerts offered are going to be so much fun. Please read each description of your pledge level carefully.  (Keep in mind that for many of the prizes that are \"experiences\", you'll have the remainder of 2014 and all of 2015 to schedule.  We'll work it out!)\nI love the EQUALITY PLEDGE level. Here's why.  When I came out of the closet and began using my public platform to advocate for the LGBT community, I was blown away to learn just how big our community is. All those years in hiding, thinking that I was alone. Gosh, was I wrong! \nAnd to compound the emotions of it all, I discovered that there are SO MANY straight allies out there in the world who have stood up publicly to voice their support for EQUALITY. Many of you have told me that you\u2019d like to show your support for my coming out, but you\u2019re not sure how. Well this is how. The EQUALITY PLEDGE will reflect your support and your pledge will be counted along with other pledgers who support LGBT Equality. I think it'll be powerful for folks to see the EQUALITY PLEDGE'S final tally. \nThis year marks my 20 year anniversary of making records. I have been really fortunate to have dedicated fans who\u2019ve been with me since very early on in my career and together we\u2019ve accomplished great things. \nI have always considered myself lucky to have been able to make records in Nashville with the best musicians, producers and record labels in the business and to have relationships with some of the greatest radio stations in the country. I cherish the hit records and triumphs that I was blessed to have. \nBut the thing that I've always been most proud of is my relationship with the fans.  We accomplished so much together.  Let\u2019s make some new memories!\nThis is the new chapter of my life and my career and I can\u2019t thank you enough for your support.\nxo chely\nmore info about Chely at www.chely.com\nPlease learn more about these great organizations that do so much to further equality for the LGBT community. \nLIKEME.org\nGLSEN.org\nHRC.org\nNOH8\nNCLRights.org\nGLAAD.org\nFaithInAmerica.org\nFamilyEquality.org", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOf course, as most of you know, making records is more of an abstract endeavor than a scientific one.

Follow along with all our production news and updates at www.coolest.com/countdown!\nA 21st Century Cooler? It's about time!\nRegular coolers are boring, break easily and are a hassle to haul around just to carry the ice. The COOLEST cooler is 60 quarts of AWESOME packed with so much fun you'll look for excuses to get outside more often.\nMaybe you want to use the built-in ice crushing blender to whip up some margaritas or smoothies on your next boat trip or tailgate?\nMaybe you just want to always have music on hand with the waterproof bluetooth speaker or want to recharge your electronics with the built in USB charger?\nWhat else?\nREWARDS:\nUPDATE:  Color Voting Complete! \nHere are the Final Coolest Color options. When you pledge for a Coolest we'll send you a survey after the campaign to make your color choice.\nScroll on down for more details...                     \n      BLENDER\nNothing is more refreshing on a hot day than a cold blended cocktail or smoothie.  The 18 volt ice-crushing beast built into the COOLEST will power through more than 6 gallons of blended goodness on a single charge.\n WATERPROOF WIRELESS SPEAKERS\nIf life is supposed to be a party, then you better bring the music. You\u2019re gathered around the cooler anyway, but now you can DJ the music right from your phone or Bluetooth-enabled device directly to your COOLEST. Just turn your phone on, match it with the COOLEST speaker, and rock out with your bad self.\n                        USB CHARGER\n Since you\u2019ve got that 18 volt battery for the blender, why not get the most out of it? Maybe your camera battery is low or maybe you have an iPhone you just want to use after 3:00 in the afternoon... Re-charge your gear wherever you are with the waterproof USB charger.\n                          LED LID LIGHT\nThe party doesn\u2019t stop just because the sun goes down, and you shouldn\u2019t have to freeze your fingers searching endlessly for your favorite drink.  The COOLEST has unbreakable lights embedded in the lid so you easily find what you\u2019re looking for with the push of a button.\n                       GEAR TIE-DOWN\nCarrying your gear to and from your destination is a hassle, and your old cooler isn\u2019t doing you any favors.\nThe COOLEST's locking tie-downs are like having a roof-rack on your cooler so three trips can be done in one. Easily secure your lawn chairs, blankets, towels, toys, fishing tackle, or grill.\n                         BEACH TIRES\nOne of the worst unintended workouts can be had by trying to drag a conventional cooler through a sandy beach.  The COOLEST wheels are twice as wide so they roll easily and don't sink in.\n               ESSENTIAL STORAGE\nThere are certain essentials you need for any outdoor gathering so why not have a built in cubby to store them?  The COOLEST has storage for a half dozen reusable plastic plates, which also double as a cutting board for the ceramic rust-proof pairing knife.  \n                SPLIT LID and DIVIDER\nThe COOLEST has a split lid design so you can get access to ice for the blender without letting too much warm air in.  This also lets you keep your cups in the cup holders so you don't have to put everything on the ground just to grab another cold drink.\nThe split lid design and removable divider give you some great packing options.  You can keep your cocktail ice separate from your regular ice. Or you could put ice only on one side, pull the drain plug and the other side becomes a totally dry refrigerator, perfect for keeping sandwiches and any other perishable food cool and dry.\n                       BOTTLE OPENER\nHow many hours of your life have been wasted or teeth chipped because someone walked off with the bottle opener.  My grandpa's cooler had a bottle opener and so does the COOLEST.\nTHE STORY\nI\u2019m always looking to maximize my fun when I get together with my family and friends. That\u2019s why I am so passionate about the COOLEST. I invent lots of things, but other than my Jello-shot catapult very few have brought so much fun to my life. ;)\nI know firsthand how much fun it is to have a cooler with speakers, and a portable blender for beachside margaritas, because I built myself one of each around ten years ago. Last year I reexamined these well-loved creations and realized just how much room for improvement there was. \nWhat's next?\nI have manufactured and brought other products to market, but for a project of this size and complexity I'll be using a pool of experts in the field to make sure the COOLEST lives up to it\u2019s name.\nThe professional sourcing company I've partnered with has manufactured other coolers, as well as high tech gear. They have an experienced team in the field to assist with quality control, shipping and and other logistics. \nWe want you to have your COOLEST as soon as possible. Here\u2019s our plan to achieve that:\nJuly/August: Make lots of new Kickstarter friends, execute manufacturing agreements/standards\nSeptember:Finalize the engineering and prototype iterations and place the tooling orders\nOctober:  Tooling build-out and procurement of raw materials and components\nNovember: Part qualification and pre-production builds, pilot production, quality assurance and product validation\nDecember: Begin manufacturing for the injection molded and blow-molded parts\nJanuary/February: Finalize the assembly and shipment process and begin fulfillment", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nNo one wants to see a good idea executed poorly, especially one called the COOLEST. We have worked extremely hard to ready this product for Kickstarter and full-scale manufacturing and fulfillment, but here are what I see as the risks:\n\n\nMANUFACTURING: Creating the tooling to manufacture a product of this size is expensive and requires expert knowledge to get it right. There is typically a 60 day lead time to create the molds for a product of this size and this is where delays could occur. To minimize that possibility we're working with tooling manufacturers partners with a track record for prompt quality.\n\nPRODUCT ADJUSTMENTS: As the COOLEST gets geared up for production, there will likely be some minor adjustments to improve the final product. Pre-production prototypes are made to test and refine the product and allow us to incorporate our adjustments and those suggested by experienced manufacturing partners. These will always be for the benefit of you, the consumer, and we will let you know exactly how and why any are made.\n\nFULFILLMENT: Sometimes things go awry that can\u2019t be planned for: a supplier misses a deadline, a machine breaks down, or a shipment gets lost. Those things could cause a delay. To minimize the possibility of manufacturing setbacks we will enter the manufacturing stage with at least one back-up supplier for each component pre-located and my product commercialization experts will help ensure smooth sailing from our suppliers and factories.\n\nWe will be working with manufacturers who have years of experience delivering excellent products in tremendous quantities. There will no doubt be some surprises along the road, but any obstacle will be addressed by combining our internal knowledge with external expertise, and an overall goal of making the best possible product for you, our COOLEST customer.\n\nAny pledge amount brings us one step closer to our goal.

If you would like to sell, distribute, or propose a partnership with our game-changing technology send us a message here. \nTo track us as we lead a global solar cooking revolution follow us on Facebook and Twitter or jump on our newsletter (twice a month, valuable content).\n\n   GoSun Stove Online     I      Facebook      I      Twitter      I      Newsletter\nWHAT OTHERS ARE SAYING ABOUT GoSun: \nTree Hugger - \"It is absolutely brilliant for a number of reasons, and is going to change the way we think about solar cooking.\"\nGrist - \"We\u2019re usually pretty skeptical about Kickstarters, but we can\u2019t resist fangirling a bit about this one.\"\nInhabitat - \"This uber awesome tube stove can cook delicious meals without using a lick of fuel \u2013 in just 20 minutes.\"\n Fast: Cooks a meal in as little as 20 minutes, utilizing every drop of sunshine\nPortable: Pre-assembled package, deploy in seconds, weighing less than 4lbs \nVersatile: Cook what you want and how you want. Bake, boil and fry; if there's sun, you're good to go.\nFuel Free and Clean: No burning charcoal embers to dispose of, no open flame to worry about. When you are done cooking, just fold up your GoSun and go.\nSummer or Winter:  If there is sunlight, you are cooking, even after a snow; plus, the wind won't steal your heat\nKeeps Food Hot For Hours: Our evacuated tube technology is in essence a giant thermos. This means that when spotty clouds arrive, the tube will remain hot and steadily cook between sun-breaks. Plus, it keeps your brownies warm for hours until a late night snack.\nDesigned for simplicity, durability, and mobility, the GoSun offers a convenient, user friendly package for our fast paced lives. The GoSun is as simple in principle as it is powerful, effectively retaining 80-90% of all sunlight that is caught in its footprint. The technology relies on the principles of parabolic reflection, evacuation (for its insulating value) and the Greenhouse effect, to make the most advanced solar cooking device to date. \nThe GoSun will passively work its magic whenever the sun is shining.  Water can be heated and hot meals can be prepared with a little patience even on the coldest winter day.  A vacuum between two layers of tough glass prevents the outside ambient temperature from transferring into the inner cooking zone.\nProof of a meal in 20 minutes with sunshine (1:07 video)\nHow to use the GoSun (45 second video)\nWhy solar cooking?\n Traditional grilling is a lengthy, tedious process involving dirty and bulky equipment.  Grills are rarely portable and, when they are, they typically involve handling extremely hot and messy equipment. Nothing in today\u2019s market is eco\u2010friendly, efficient, innovative or stylish.  The existing solar ovens are insufficient for today\u2019s fast- paced lifestyle; they are too big, too slow and not user friendly. \nThat is why we developed the GoSun Stove!\nOur analysis comparing the GoSunStove to portable and stationary propane grills, charcoal grills and camping stoves shows the GoSunStove ranking most desirable based on capacity, ease of use, cost, speed, style, safety, and versatility.\nMaking Converts with GoSun MINI (35 second video)\nWhat we will do with the money: \nWe are a perfect project for KickStarter, because we honestly need this money to set up production, thus meeting minimum order quantities. We've put a ton of time and money in at this point and we're prepared for the exciting road ahead.  Your backing gives us what we need to put the gears in motion.\nTools, Labor, Materials and Shipping: 77% of funds To bring you the GoSun Stove at a reasonable price, we are producing in China - where over 90% of the world's evacuated tubes originate. We're using high quality materials and tooling up with expensive jigs, dies and formers.  Adam Moser, our Chinese Liaison, is committed to working with our experienced manufacturer who respects both the product, their employees and the environment.  \nEmpowerment Program: 11.5% of funds We are committed to empowering others with our game changing technology. In coordination with a number of international partners (including Sonlight Power, Friends of Belle Riviere, Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves) we aim to first educate, then provide a version of the GoSun especially built for the needs of the developing world. The GoSun Empowerment Program is committed to spreading this technology in a socially, environmentally, and financially sustainable way.\nMarket Development: 7.5% of funds There is a great opportunity for this innovative cooking technology but we will have to get the GoSun in front of people to share the light.  Barriers to this new school solar cooking such as recipe modification and conforming to a tubular shape will have to be addressed through our media and on-the-ground presence.  We'll be attending events, producing videos, gathering data, tackling problems and training GoSun Ambassadors to facilitate the switch to cooking with the sun.\nEducational Material: 4% of funds The children are the future and so is renewable energy.  We are going to develop  products and curriculum to meet national educational standards for classrooms - 3rd through 8th grade.   \nDesigners, Humanitarians and Solar Oveneers\nPatrick Sherwin: Founder and Solar Energy Expert, is passionate about play, yet remains focused on solutions for our time. A veteran solar engineer with extensive small business, international project management, and sales experience.

Set up like a Health Club for inventors, engineers, artists, crafters and hackers, Buildmore Workshop has been instrumental in the GoSun Stove's evolution.\nSocial and Environmental Benefits:\nGender Equality and Women's Rights - less time and resources spent gathering fuel and making fires, increasing time for education and development                                                                                     \nEnvironmental Sustainability - by reducing the need for wood and charcoal, the GoSun will slow deforestation, soil loss, desertification                                                       \nIndoor Air Quality - by eliminating much of the need for indoor cooking fires, the GoSun will reduce smoke inhalation, the second leading cause of death globally                                                                                                        \nRenewable Energy Access and Education - the GoSun is often the foot-in-the-door for a more solar fueled life                                                           \nEnergy Security - off-the-grid, self reliance, independence                                                                \nNo Child Left Inside - getting outdoors to stop Nature Deficiency Disorder\nWhere are we now:\nThe GoSun team has created over 30 prototypes over the last few years of development; most have been put to the test and critiqued by peers.  We have demoed the GoSun Stove to several large gatherings (Bonnaroo Music and Arts Festival, Ingenuity Fest, Hacker Faire, etc.) in front of thousands of people; many whom ask \"how much?\" and \"where can I buy one?\"  \nWe've been building the GoSun in small quantities by hand, and we cannot keep up with the interest.  Recently having developed our best designed and replicable model, we've developed relationships with a manufacturer in China.

If you missed the Kickstarter campaign, you can view STRONG LIKE BULL products available at www.stronglikebullmagnets.com\nIn funding project updates:\n1) A stainless steel part will be inserted into the 'jaw' area to make sure this opener truly lasts a lifetime... more details can be found in Update #7.\n2) A cool packakaging tin is being offered as an add-on... more details can be found in update #10.\nBottle openers are certainly well covered territory on Kickstarter.  My recently unsucessful Bottlejak stopper project incorporated a bottle opener feature, and I found it fun to use.   And so, it led me to sketch up a few pages full of opener concepts... along with many pages of ideas as equally unusual as the Bottlejak... but the world does not appear quite ready for those just yet:) \nKickstarters love bottle openers...\nMade in the Carolinas!\n-There have been a few 'small format' openers of various types... I own the very nice Torq from creator Mike Bond.\n-There have been lots of 'pocket tools' featuring openers.  I own the Bottle Grenade from creator Brad and the Pickpocket from creator Michael Dickson.. these are cool designs.\n-There have been wall mounted openers, stick on openers, and even a bike seat post opener.\nSo again, well covered ground, but I still wanted to give it a go...\nI always try to be as unique and original as possible.  I received a lot of positive feedback from my previous Strong Like Bull Magnet project... backers interested in where I could go with the 'brand'.  I also had many backers say they liked Bottlejak and it's opener feature.. so I decided to kind of combine those elements into the STRONG LIKE BULL bottle opener project.\nThere are lots of cool machined-from-sheetmetal type products on KS.  So I thought if I made a really substantial sized, hand held opener, then that would be a fun new direction.  Something you'll have a hard time losing, something to throw in your kitchen drawer or display on your bar top. \nI thought I was on to something, but then I found the successfully funded 'Beer Claw'... this project is more of what I wanted to do from a size perspective, but it's a very rustic wood and metal design and I was more interested in a modern clean metal look. So I thought my eventual design was a different enough direction to pursue.  \nFeels great, all edges are beveled\nDesign Time...\nI wanted substantial, so 1/2 inch thick aluminum was the starting point.  From there, I took some inspiration from some knife handle designs and created a prominent spot for the SLB logo.  I'm happy with the result... I think it looks great, works great, and feels great.\nMaking It...\nStarting with a block of aluminum, there's a great amount of machining to produce the final part which clocks in at 4.5oz.  Aluminum is pretty lightweight... so when you have 4.5oz of it, you've got a pretty big piece of aluminum.  The overall length is over 6 inches and the width approaches 2 inches at the widest part.\nThe logo is stamped on both sides.\nWith your support, the funding from the project will allow for a large enough order to get the pricing to a reasonable level.  As always, I utilize local, US machine and anodizing shops to allow me to be involved in overseeing the production.\nFinishes...\nI plan to offer several anodized color options.  Anodizing is an electrochemical process that converts the metal surface into a decorative, durable, corrosion-resistant finish.\nDepending on how funding goes, I'll offer several anodize colors... more details on this as the project moves along.  \nKeep it handy...\nThe SLB Bottle Opener is designed to allow a SLB magnet to fit in the handle to allow it to be stuck to a metal surface.  Hang it on your refrigerator or grill to keep it handy.\nIf you have a SLB magnet from my last project, then you are all set... if not, I have configured a reward that includes the opener and 1 SLB magnets of your choice.  \nWhere the rewards money goes...\nWhile not inexpensive... it's a large, one-of-a-kind, custom machined part that will pretty much last forever.  Here's a look at where the reward money goes...\nThanks for checking out the project!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIf the project achieves funding, it will be my third successfully funded project.

We've invented a 3D model of ocean farming designed to grow seaweed and shellfish to provide healthy, local food - but also reduce overfishing, help mitigate climate change and restore ocean ecosystems. Here's how: \nEat Like a Fish! Growing Local Food to Reduce Overfishing:  We're re-imagining the dinner plate by eating what fish eat: plants. We're cooking up kelp linguini, kelp ice cream - even kelp cocktails - and already on the menu at il Buco, Morimoto's and other elite NYC restaurants. So it's fun, but also healthy: our seaweeds contain more protein than soybeans and more calcium than milk. Plus fish don't make Omega-3\u2019s - they consume them. So by eating like fish, consumers get the same benefits, while reducing pressure on dwindling fish stocks.\nPickled Kelp, Crostini w/ Kelp Butter and Thimble Island Clams\nScaled up, the potential impact on our food system is mind-blowing. In a 300\u2019 x 300\u2019 plot we can grow 24 tons of seaweed in 5 months. Creating a network of small seaweed farms equaling the size of Washington State could provide enough protein to feed the world. Of course we\u2019re not all going to become ocean vegetarians, but it shows our model can have a real impact on our stressed food systems.\nRestoring Our Oceans: Two years ago while out on the boat, a light bulb went off: We realized that millions of years ago, Mother Nature invented two species - kelp and shellfish - designed to restore ocean ecosystems and mitigate climate change. And these are two species we can grow! Here's how our 3D model is a game-changer:\nClimate Change: Carbon is a root cause of acidification, rising water temps and other climate-related threats to our oceans. The kelp we grow -- known as the \u201crainforest of the sea\u201d -- absorbs five times more carbon than land-based plants. Our 20 acre farm alone has the potential to remove 134 tons of carbon a year. So we're not just fishermen - we're climate farmers.\nWater Quality: Shellfish and seaweed act as filters, drawing out nitrogen. While an important nutrient for humans, excess nitrogen from agricultural runoff is creating ever-expanding dead zones in our coastal waters. Kelp and oysters need nitrogen to grow, so our farm - which soaks up to 164 kg of nitrogen a year - is vital for restoring water quality. Then, after we've soaked up the nitrogen, we turn our kelp into liquid fertilizer for local organic farmers.\nBiofuel: We\u2019re working with a team of scientists and engineers to grow kelp biofuel. On our farm alone it\u2019s possible to grow up to 2000 gallons of biofuel per acre. According to the US Department of Energy, a network of kelp farms totaling an area \u00bd the size of Maine could grow enough biofuel to replace all of the oil in the US.\nRestoring Habitat: The gear we use - ranging from longlines to underwater cages - function as artificial reefs, attracting over 150 species that come to hide, eat and thrive. After a decade of farming, what was once a barren patch of ocean is now a robust ecosystem. Plus our gear functions as storm surge protectors, helping mitigate the impacts of extreme weather events, like the swamping of NYC by Hurricane Sandy.\nCreating Blue-Green Jobs: From Newfoundland to Louisiana, boats are beached and fish plants idled. These communities need blue-green jobs. That's why we\u2019ve designed our model to be replicated so that any person with 20 acres and a boat can start their own 3D farm, then scale up. Every component of our model will be open source and available on the web.\nWhat We Need To Scale Up\nWe currently have two 150ft longlines growing seaweed and mussels. After over a year of experimenting, we know our design works. Now we need to expand by adding 10 more longlines so we can grow over 26 tonnes of kelp in five months and 60,000 mussels.\nOur goal is to raise $30,000 for purchasing and installing these 10 new floating longlines systems. If funded, we will allocate:\n$12,000 for buying anchors and chain systems strong enough to withstand hurricanes;\n$3,000 for buoys, lines and other gear;\n$8,000 for installation and labor; and\n$7,000 for licensing fees and marine engineering consulting services.\nIf we beat our $30,000 goal and raise $50,000 we will create an educational program to train the next generation of 3D ocean farmers. Then we'll take our model on the road, as a catalyst for the creation of a network of local ocean farms, growing food-fuel-fertilizer while reducing carbon emissions and restoring our ocean ecosystems. Imagine seaweed and shellfish integrated into wind farms, fish plants re-opened to process restorative food and coal plants re-purposed to process kelp biofuel.\nBut we need your help. Together we can save our seas and ourselves.

Women\u2019s stories, leading lactation professionals, archival footage, religious iconography, and formula advertisements, show how mothers\u2019 authority was co-opted by medical professionals, and how they have been pressured to forfeit their nourishing breasts in favor of highly sexualized breasts.\nThis film shows how women can reclaim their birthright and restore the nursing mother archetype. The Milky Way is about the knowledge that inherently resides in every woman, how to access that knowledge and how to trust what we already know.

The word galaxy derives from the Greek term galaxias, \"milky one\", or kyklos and galaktikos, \"milky circle,\" because it looks a milky spiral in the night sky. In Greek mythology, Zeus places his son, Heracles, born by a mortal woman, on Hera's breast while she is asleep. Zeus wanted the baby to drink her milk so he could become divine. Hera wakes up to an unknown baby nursing at her breast. She unlatches him in surprise, and the milk having let down, sprays across the night sky, creating the Milky Way.\nThe Filmmakers\nProducer Jennifer Davidson RN BSN IBCLC is a pediatric nurse and lactation consultant at the progressive pediatric practice of Dr. Jay Gordon MD in Santa Monica, CA.

I'm on the road a lot, so when something serves multiple needs but takes almost no space- I'm really attracted to it.  I created LapMonkey with these cherished values in mind.  \nI wanted something that would serve as a book stand/media holder while I travel that was super portable.  Then I realized my laptop is already a decent book stand with most of the components already there.  However, using my screen as a book rest never felt good because I was worried the screen would get scratched and also many books or sheets of paper would slide off if not braced.  At other times I would be editing the media on the laptop screen with a pen and always felt insecure about the ink somehow getting on the laptop screen.\nSo I made my first version of LapMonkey out of aluminium corners and a flexible piece of colored plastic which was a good start.  Then I thought, \"Hey, why not make it transparent and then maybe I can just leave it on most of the time, which is I actually am doing even while I type this write up.  Later a friend who has does a lot of cross referencing with digital and written material but has a smaller screen asked, can it be designed so it could shift over to the side while being used.  The answer was \"yes!\", and so I created also the transcription mode.  See video or picture above for details.  \nI used plexiglass because it was clear, but I am realizing it is quite strong and so I thought it makes a nice shield and realized it was not a bad idea to keep it on as a safety device in certain settings.  This may include such hazards as careless children with pens, sticky baby hands covered in jam etc., splashing liquid materials that would etch your monitor.  OK, it may etch and scratch the LapMonkey but better destroying a $18 item than a $700 item- wouldn't you say.\nAs you see I got a prototype made which I use almost everyday, and when I don't, it just tucks away in my laptop carrying bag taking almost no space.  I often leave it on forgetting that it is on there.\nSlides right in with your laptop for travelling.\nWhat really needs to happen now is the following:\n1)   Getting some funding so this project can be produced efficiently where large orders from my manufacturer can be made to keep the per unit cost down.  \n2)  To give about 200 units out to those who are peer leaders in the target market.  My hope is that as people see them use the LapMonkey others will want one too.  To me this target market are those who like to keep their lives portable and light.  Specifically college students, the general education world, and travelling sales people often use a combo of written and digital material.\n3)  To advertise it in some travel magazines as funds permit.\n4) Supplying retailers with some product support materials that will draw attention to LapMonkey.\n5)  To get LapMonkey out enough into the public that it can sell itself so to speak.  I am hoping that within a year things can be set up so that it will just require some residual advertising to keep sales going.\nFor now, I plan to have part of the product manufactured through laser cutters or routers which for now will be out sourced.  If the support is strong enough it would be something worth looking into purchasing.  \nI am also open to hear from those that may want to join me in this vision.  I do feel this is the sentiment of KickStarter and working with others can be a lot more enjoyable and powerful then working on your own so feel free to come as support that way too where we can share our in born qualities to enhance the project.\nHow much this can be done will depend on how much funding this project raises.  Please join in on my vision if this project inspires you.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nMy concerns are that ideally LapMonkey works best if it is just as wide or slightly wider than the laptop frame. It is not so good if it is narrower than the laptop frame width. This means I may have to have several sizes or at least 2. Still, far as laptops go, the 15.x\" and 14.x\" represents almost 78% of the market. I feel the LapMonkey which is 14\" wide will probably be sufficient for those two sizes, though there may be some issues about it fitting in the case with its laptop bag. Actually if you have a laptop that is 14.x\", can you tell me if you think an item that is 14\" wide would fit in your laptop bag. Most people laptop bags tend to be a good 1.5 inches wider than their laptops so my hope is that it really will not matter than much. Otherwise, 14% of the market has a 13.x\" monitor and I will have to see how efficient it will be to serve that segment. It may end up confusing things to have two sizes, and I am hoping that one size will suffice most of the market. \n\nThe only other thing that concerns me is the physical transparent nature of this product makes it hard to stand out. So I have to figure out ways to present it in such a way that it attracts potential buyers walking by it.\n\nI am resourceful and have the ability to shift a design if it can't be manufactured efficiently so I am confident I can adjust as adversities come up. The simplicity of this product makes things very adjustable and this is a plus.

(Cue violin music) So far this project has been carried by passion, awesome volunteers, a sense of humor, and more of my own personal funds than anybody would advise. We need at least another $25,000 to finish a 20 mn. pilot, secure our PBS distribution contract, and attract sponsors. The more we raise the longer and better the pilot will be (see Where Your Money Will Go below for details). Your participation truly makes the difference!\nIf you need your donation to be tax-deductible, let us know (but you should know that it takes another 6% off what we receive).\nWANT TO SEE MORE?

Over 18 million people in the U.S. alone are suffering from it and in 2007, suicide was the third leading cause of death in young people. And this is just the tip of the iceberg of the proven emotional, physical, social and spiritual costs of play-deprivation. In the meantime, schools are eliminating recesses while adults are working longer hours with shorter vacations in more stultifying jobs than ever before.\nLet's face it, most of us are exhausted and over-worked. And our children are in serious trouble. To change our lifestyles we need to KNOW that play is not a luxury, that our basic health and well-being depend on it. Seriously! The movie will make the importance of play irrefutable and help unleash the immense resources we need in order to meet the challenges of our time.\nLET'S PLAY! \nThank you so much for contributing what you can.

Since then the project has received three grants and generous private donations that have enabled us to film about 1/3 of the interviews. \nWith $25,000 we will be able to cover the following topics:\nThe evolution of play in animals and humans\nEarly childhood development and the crisis created by current trends\nThe possibilities and benefits of play through old age\nIf we raise $50,000 we will be able to create a 30 min. piece that includes these topics: \nThe great video game debate\nHow play heals trauma\nHow play transforms communities and public spaces\nAnd with $75,000 will be able to produce a piece that includes these topics:\nThe signs of an emerging play movement\nCreativity, innovation, and discovery\nHow all of life can be play\nAnd with $100,000 we can finish the 1 hour production that includes:\nAnimations\nGraphics\nOriginal Soundtrack\nAnd with more than $100,000 we can include stories from around the world.\nTo read more about the stories we're planning to cover go HERE\nWHAT YOU GET (OH BOY!)\nOf course, more than anything else, you get that special feeling of being part of something both meaningful and FUN!
