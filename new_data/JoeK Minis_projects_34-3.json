This will be arranged via the Pledge Manager, and more information will be posted soon.\nThe cost of shipping is not included in your pledge, and will be added after the conclusion of the campaign through the pledge manager.\nI will provide you all with full instructions when the time comes. I am still finalising the exact shipping costs, but to give you a rough idea here are a couple of preliminary estimates:\nTREASURE MAP: - \u00a30 unless used to purchase miniatures in the campaign.\nBOGLIN/OURK/BREWZERKER: \u00a34 to the UK, \u00a312 EU (Tracked Shipping) \u00a315 US (Tracked shipping), \u00a315 ROW (Tracked Shipping).\nDREAMEATER: \u00a35 to the UK, \u00a315 EU (Tracked Shipping) \u00a320 US (Tracked shipping), \u00a318 ROW (Tracked Shipping).\nThese estimates may increase if you purchase a large number of additional models on top of your core pledge. The final shipping costs are subject to change, and will be based on your location and specific rewards.\nIf you are backing from outside of the UK, please be aware of any import or customs fees your country will charge you. Warploque Miniatures is not a VAT registered business, and as such your country may charge you VAT on your shipment. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAny undertaking of this nature is a huge commitment and a lot of work for everyone involved. Miniatures need sculpting, manufacturing, packing and eventually shipping to the backers.\n\nIt is at these hurdles that some Kickstarters have faltered in the past, so, I have given careful consideration to each part of the process to minimise potential risk. Warploque Miniatures is a family run business, so everyone involved is 100% dedicated to making this project as successful and professional as possible. My father is our resin caster, my mother is in charge of packing and shipment, and our metal caster is a tried and tested craftsman we have worked with for over five years.\n\nAlso, instead of relying purely on concept art and work-in-progress sculpts to illustrate my products all of the initial models that I am offering have already been sculpted. They've been cast, the display copies have been painted, and they are ready to go into production, so backers know exactly what they are investing in. I will be relying on Work in Progress sculpts and concept art for some of the stretch goals, but be assured that they will be completed and cast in a timely manner once the campaign has been funded.\n\nFinally, I have set achievable delivery date estimates. I have kept the campaign small and manageable, eschewing an overly long list of stretch goals, so this project has a much higher probability of being completed and delivered on time.\n\nThis is the 10th Kickstarter that Warploque Miniatures has run, and we have a reputation amongst our community for not only delivering a high quality product, but delivering it on time.

Legendary Kingdoms is a gamebook campaign, where you lead a party of adventurers in a world that adapts to your actions. Venture into ancient ruins, pick a side and lead an army into battle, sail the high seas on your own warship, defeat tyrants or restore them to power. Along the way your party will increase in skill, wealth and renown, allowing them to take on more challenging adventures. Reach the heights of power and you may uncover a dreadful threat to the world itself and go on a mission that spans all six gamebooks in the series.\nSo is this a Solo Gamebook or an RPG?\nThe Legendary Kingdoms series has been designed to be played solo, as a choose your own adventure gamebook. However, as you lead a party of four adventurers on an epic journey in a truly sandbox world, we have had playthroughs where one person has acted as the GM (Narrator) and four friends have taken on a character each.\nIt works just as well being played online as it does around a table.\nPlaytesters and backers have commented on how good this book is for someone who would love to have a go at being a GM, but are daunted by the task. With simple combat rules and the turns already written out, where better to have your first go at being a GM, than in Legendary Kingdoms.\nFollow the link below and download a free sample and give it a go.\nWe are raising funds to produce the second book in the series, Book Two: Crown and Tower. Book One is already in print, and you can buy it here, or get it as part of a pledge bundle when you order Book Two. You can also play a fully illustrated free sample of book one here to experience a little of the gamebook adventure.\n\nIn total, Spidermind Games is planning to produce six titles in the legendary Kingdoms series. With your help we can bring book two, 'Crown & Tower' to life and begin work on the next in the series. It is our plan to release one title a year, completing the collection in 2025.\nYou can explore the world of Legendary Kingdoms in any order you choose. Each book is dedicated to a particular geographic area, but you can travel between books at will by walking or sailing off the edge of the map. Each book features dozens of quests and locations with an approximate 12+ hours of content in each.\nFeatures of Legendary Kingdoms\nA world that adapts to your choices. The book \u2018remembers\u2019 the friends you make and enemies you defeat. Slain kings will stay dead, and as you grow in fame people\u2019s reactions to you will also change.\nA changing world. Depending on your choices, new avenues of adventure, or new trouble, could await you in locations you have previously explored.\nA detailed world. From the lawless deserts of the Valley of Bones, to the feudal hierarchies of the Kingdom of Royce. Embrace the wild freedoms of the buccaneering Splintered Isles, or face morbid darkness in the forges of Drakehallow.  Be the first to map the unexplored Savage Lands, or dethrone a corrupt king in the ludicrously wealthy Duchy of Pendrilor. Multi-book spanning quests allow you to further your ambitions in distant courts, and make friends in foreign nations that might help you when you visit their homeland.\nParty based adventures. You are not alone, but can combine the skills of up to four different characters in your party.\nThe game can be played solo or in a group.  It also works online with one player acting as the reader!  A good lockdown game.\nCharacters that are grounded in the Legendary Kingdoms world. Each party member has ties to a different book in the series, and each has unresolved issues in their homeland. Characters can seek redemption, seize power, exact revenge or fall in love with other party members.\nFast paced but tactical personal combat.\nRaise an army and fight mass combat battles with thousands of soldiers on each side. Conquered one realm? Transfer troops from one book to another if you can capture city-ports with access to ships.\nSail the world on your own ship. Gather an armada and defeat powerful rulers with your own fleet of warships. Or peacefully trade goods between rich ports.\nPowerful magic unlocks secrets galore! Think you\u2019ve completely explored an area? Discover the Shadow Door spell and find hidden paths in old dungeons. Learn how to Teleport and access areas impossible to find without magic. Bypass a foe\u2019s defences by using Teleport Circle to appear inside their fortress, allowing you to rob them blind.\nForge magic items with magical weaves. Raise armies with gold bullion. Raid vaults to find treasures that provide great wealth and power.\nA globe-spanning mega plot. Concealed within the books are hints of a deadly and growing danger. When you hit the heights of power you might be able to unravel a conspiracy that threatens the very world itself.\n What are the reviewers saying...\nBecca Scott from Good Time Society tells you everything you need to know about Crown & Tower.\nDoug from 2+Tough takes us into the Arena at the beginning of his adventure.\n Joe, Hannah and Alex over at Roll for Review take a look at Crown & Tower and Joe is impressed...\nTodd from ClassicRolePlayer did a review and playthrough of book 1 a few weeks back.\nEach book in the Legendary Kingdom series covers a different geographic area on the world map. These region books each have a more detailed, zoomed-in version of the map. Every location on the map can be reached, either on foot, by sea or by magical transportation (if you possess such a power). You can go back and forth between books at will \u2013 just walk or sail off the edge of the map.\nBook 1: The Valley of Bones takes place in a desert wilderness where tyrant kings oppress the teeming masses in a land strewn with ancient artefacts and ruins. But their grip on power is fragile \u2026 and the citizenry are ripe for revolution. It is a land of blood and sand, where civilisation is rare and terrible beasts roam freely.\nBook 2: Crown and Tower takes place in the high-medieval realm of Longport Bay, torn apart by the struggle for power between two noble families. Baron Baldwin Dayne lies dying, and his children must grasp the mantle of power, or see their family destroyed forever. Ancient ruins await plunder and exploration, and savage armies hang on the borders, waiting for the county to weaken itself with its incessant warring. Glittering steel, the flash of long forgotten magics, and terrible monsters all wait to be found as you build your strength for the final confrontation.\nBook 3: Pirates of the Splintered Isles is set in a tropical paradise, where competition for spice has the great powers of the world vying for domination.\nBook 4: The Gilded Throne covers the duchy of Pendrilor, seat of the corrupt king of Royce. Wealth drips from its ports, but it is blind to an encroaching threat which could see it wiped from the globe!\nBook 5: The Savage Lands is set in an untamed wilderness, unmapped by civilised realms. A terrible secret lurks in its forgotten grottos and sky-touching mountains.\nBook 6: Drakehallow is a gas-powered hell of furnaces and sorcery. The population cram into over-packed, crumbling cities for fear of encountering the monstrous creations of their depraved industry. \nMore Art\nWe are commissioning 20 more pieces of art for the book including a more detailed pictorial journey through the city of Longport Bay.\n \u2018The Sonderleign Drops\u2019\nA brand new stand alone adventure.\n\u201cThere is something I desire, but it is located in a place my conventional agents will not go. Deep in the woods to the northwest are the Sonderleign Drops, the ruins of a fantastic underground city. Many have attempted to excavate and explore it in the past, but even the largest expeditions have failed.\u201d\nThis adventure is on top of a book, already with more that 900 references and will test your team but the rewards are well worth it.\u201d\nYet More Art\nTravelling the County of Longport Bay this art expansion creates more images of the rich and diverse land you are exploring.\n\n\u2018Missing, Presumed Dead\u2019\nA second brand new adventure takes your team on a mission to find an important officer of the crown who has gone missing. This particular man is a clerk at the seigneurial office. Its role is to determine which nobles own which piece of land, which family members are permitted to inherit titles, and what legal privileges the ownership of certain noble ranks grant in tax and trade law. It is pretty dry stuff, but the decisions of the seigneurial office can ruin lesser families or provoke war between greater ones.\nWhere is he and why did he suddenly disappear?\nProduction Upgrade\nCollectors Edition:-\nIt was suggested that we have dust covers for the collectors editions, so that these premium copies of the Legendary Kingdoms series can enjoy the same amazing cover art that the softbacks do. We loved the suggestion and so as soon as this stretch is hit we will include dust covers on all current and future current and future volumes of the LK Collectors Edition.\nSoftback Edition:-\nHaving spoken to the printers the book will now with thicker more sturdy paper but at no extra cost. This upgrade will extend the life of the book and give the pages a smoother feel and a crisper print.\n\u2018Maw of Abraxas\u2019\nYou are wandering the bleak Mawlands, an area of scrubland just north of the Salvar Rise, a chain of mountains that shields the county of Longport Bay from the Savage Lands to the south.\nThe area gets its name from the terrifying cave network known as the Maw of Abraxas, which plunges into the mountain foothills. It has a terrifying reputation as a place of death, although rumours persist of great treasures hidden away in its secret vaults.\nTempted?\nEven More Art\nGetting to know the characters more with extra art covering even more of the key moments in your adventures.\nBookmark Ribbon and a Character Sheet Upgrade\nAnother great suggestion from our backers is the very useful page holder ribbon and it would be our pleasure to be able to include this in every Collectors Edition copy.\nWe have also taken a look at the free character sheet everyone can download as a pdf and decided it need the same art upgrade as the maps. We will show off the new and improved version here on the updates when it has been complete.\nA Brand New Adventure, played live on our Facebook Group.\nPlay Legendary Kingdoms with players across the world on Facebook!  If this target is reached, Legendary Kingdoms author Oliver Hulme will create a unique adventure that will update on Facebook every week.  Players worldwide will help in designing party members, and will jointly decide what actions to take that week via Facebook polls.\nCreate your own characters or choose from six adventurers with their own deep backstory in the world, each of whom have personalised quests and interactions with the plot. Your characters can gain special powers, fall in love, seek revenge, become lords and ladies and encounter friends, family and enemies from their youths. Each of the six starting characters were brought up in a different part of the world, and all have their own special quests to resolve in their homeland.\n(or Nitty-gritty)\nLegendary Kingdoms uses a success-based dice system for skill checks and combat. Each party-member has a skill value in each of the five main skills of the game (Fighting, Stealth, Lore, Survival and Charisma). Each skill point allows you to roll a single die. Sar Jessica Dayne, for instance, has a Fighting skill of 5, which means she can roll 5 dice whenever she makes any Fighting skill checks. Your party will either make skill-checks individually, if they are separated, or as a team if more than one person can help with a check.\nYour skills can improve through experience or by finding special items. Find a steel longsword (Fighting +2) and you can improve your Fighting skill by 2, for instance. As you play, you will have to decide if you want your party-members to specialise in certain skills, or have them generally improve all their skills. Both ideas have merit. Specialisation is powerful when you are working as a team \u2026 but if your party has an argument or someone wanders off on their own, you might prefer it if everyone was equipped to handle everything. Just like real life, you won\u2019t always be able to count on your friends being around all the time!\nThe game keeps track of events through the use of codes. Save an old man and his family from the city guards and you might gain the code A15. Every so often, the book will ask you if you have a code. Having the code A15 will stop you from constantly encountering old men being hassled by the city guards every time you walk down the street!\nThe best way to see how the game works is by playing it. You can download the Kickstarter sample here.\nFree PDF Quickstart\nIf you have ever played Fighting Fantasy or Choose Your Own Adventure books, you have the basic idea of what a gamebook looks like. In terms of how it plays, it is quite similar structurally to Fabled Lands by Dave Morris & Jamie Thomson. That book series also featured a number of connected books that you could wander between at will. Long term, Legendary Kingdoms feels quite similar to Sorcery by Steve Jackson, in that it has a grand quest, sorcery is rare and powerful, and there is a final goal to achieve. There is also just a whiff of Way of the Tiger by Mark Smith and Jamie Thomson, mainly through Akihiro and his quest for enlightenment.\nLegendary Kingdoms itself is a zero to hero narrative. You begin as penniless slaves, and end the game becoming great generals who make or break the future of the world based on your actions. The main difference with games like Sorcery or Destiny Quest is that you decide the order you want to do it. There are many ways into the main super-plot of the books, and different parties will experience different routes in. Forgive us for being cryptic \u2026 but we don\u2019t want to ruin the plot!\nThat said, each book is also very self-contained. There are several dozen independent quests, one \u2018book quest\u2019 which involves the epic clash of armies, one character quest, where the history and goals of one of the pre-generated characters is explored in depth, and a number of minor party-member events. These minor events allow your party members to fall in love, become enemies, save each other\u2019s lives, or just give each other time to shine.\n\"I enjoyed the preview so much that I purchased the pdf of Book 1 to keep playing!\" \n- Emma\n\n\"Loving the sample book - really high quality while still retaining that \u2018retro\u2019 feel.\"\n- Simon\n\n\"I downloaded the demo and then played it.

By backing this project you are agreeing to have your card charged with the amount you pledge at the project end, which is Thursday 15th April.\nFollowing the end of the campaign, usually a few weeks later, we will send you a post campaign survey where you will confirm your pledge level (and get a chance to upgrade if you wish), give us your address details and settle the postage. If you have ordered both books in the softcover form, you will be given the option of splitting the postage and being sent book 1 straight away and then book 2 when production is complete (estimated to be September).\nThis process will have you making two payments, the first for the pledge, a charging process handled by Kickstarter which will happen on or around 15th April, and then the second for postage and any upgrades, which is handled by the company sending you the survey. For this campaign we will be using a company called Backer Kit.\nSo how do I make a pledge?\nAt the top of the campaign page you will see the green \u201cBack this project\u201d button. Alternatively, you can scroll down to select a reward tier.\nAfter selecting the tier you wish to pledge for, check the amount being pledged and select 'continue' to proceed.\nYou will then be taken through to the payments page where you\u2019ll be prompted to enter your payment details. To complete your pledge, click the green \u201cPledge\" button and you\u2019ll be all set!\nYou should receive a confirmation email to confirm that you are now a backer of the project. As long as we are successfully funded, your card will be charged when the campaign ends.\n\nMarketed & Promoted by  \nThis project is promoted by Green Inbox, the tech marketing company behind many successful Kickstarters.

His Age of Reptiles graphic novels are universally acclaimed for their stunning depiction of dinosaurs and prehistory. With his work as a storyboard artist and character designer for films including Apollo 13, Avatar: The Last Airbender, The Incredibles, Men in Black, and Wall-e, Delgado is also one of Hollywood's leading conceptual designers. And his latest endeavor just might be his most ambitious creation to date.\nThe all-new illustrated novel DRACULA OF TRANSYLVANIA, which features an original story and more than 20 lavish illustrations, reimagines Bram Stoker\u2019s classic vampire story like you've never seen it before.\n\u201cRicardo Delgado's reimagining of Dracula is strange and bold and brilliantly original. I love it and WOULD be stunned by it if it wasn't coming from Ricardo. But brilliant is pretty much what I've come to expect from him. Still... He may have surpassed his usual brilliance here.\u201d\n\u2014Mike Mignola, creator of Hellboy\nIn DRACULA OF TRANSYLVANIA, the year is 1899. Young Solicitor Jonathan Harker braves ghosts, demons, living skeletons, and armies of rats\u2014all of which pale in comparison to his encounters with Dracula of Transylvania, the Son of Satan. The demonic, shapeshifting vampire imposes his wrath, malice and vengeance upon an England about to enter the Modern Era.\n\u201cRicardo Delgado does for vampires what he has done for dinosaurs! His elegant and bloody take on Stoker's classic tale is refreshingly original and scary.\u201d\n\u2014John Landis, Director of An American Werewolf in London and Thriller\n\nDRACULA OF TRANSYLVANIA supports and builds upon Stoker\u2019s classic and haunting original story, but this is most certainly not your parents' Dracula. This personification of the Nosferatu king is dark and powerful, a malevolent antagonist who suffers no fools, accepts no failure and crushes anyone in his path. Dracula is vileness incarnate, a pure thing of Hell. He\u2019s spent the past thousand years putting sword to flesh and tearing at the tapestry of history as the son of Satan himself. Kings, Popes and armies fear Dracula. And so should you.\n\u201cDark and disturbing but so BEAUTIFUL. I am always mesmerized by his artwork, now after this, it\u2019ll be hard to sleep. Thanks Ricardo!\u201d\n\u2014Genndy Tartakovsky, creator of Primal and Samurai Jack\n\n\u201cRicardo Delgado breathes new life into the prince of the undead like he has done with every genre he has worked in!\u201d\n\u2014Geof Darrow, creator of Shaolin Cowboy, conceptual designer for The Matrix films\nDRACULA OF TRANSYLVANIA is footnoted throughout with historical facts from the ancient to the modern world that bring texture to the sprawling and haunting adventure. Murder among English tombstones! Daring chases through the infamous underground Paris Ossuaries! A spectacular gladiatorial battle within Rome's Colosseum during the Witching Hour! And finally, a fever-pitch chase through Europe to the most terrifying place on earth: Castle Dracula.\nThe DRACULA OF TRANSYLVANIA Kickstarter will have multiple tiers and rewards available for backers, including signed leather-bound hardcover copies of the book, limited edition prints, original sketches, and an exclusive clamshell/bookplate.\nDRACULA OF TRANSYLVANIA is epic gothic storytelling with the pulse-pounding pace of the modern thriller, a cross between THE EXORCIST and the LORD OF THE RINGS. It is a brilliant and dark reimagining of the classic original story with a fascinating new perspective on one of literature\u2019s most feared characters.\nSigned Leather-Bound Edition\n\n\u201cDelgado\u2019s work always impresses. And the illustrations for his Dracula novel are yet another example of his fantastic design sense and his absolutely horrifically messed up imagination!\u201d\n\u2014Tim Miller, director of Deadpool and Terminator: Dark Fate\n\n\u201cIf you thought Ricardo Delgado was a great dinosaur artist... well, you're right\u2014he is! But with his Dracula book, Ricardo has outdone himself. He has dramatically risen to a new artistic plateau in a genre and territory previously unassociated with him. Dracula will long be remembered as a major marker in Delgado's impressive body of work as a graphic storytelling artist.\u201d\n\u2014William Stout, author of The New Dinosaurs\n\u201cStunning artwork and unforgettable prose. Delgado\u2019s book is a must-have for every Horror and vampire fan.\u201d\n\u2014Gary Rhodes, Ph.D, author of The Birth of the American Horror Film and writer/director of Lugosi: Hollywood\u2019s Dracula\n\n\u201cDelgado takes us on a wild ride as he skillfully introduces  the next generation of Vampire hunters in a style reminiscent of the original Dracula novel.\u201d\n\u2014Dacre Stoker, co-author of Dracula the Undead and Dracul and great-grand-nephew of Bram Stoker\nWriter & Artist Ricardo Delgado\n The Book\n*Final Art/Design May Change\nDelgado's Dracula of Transylvania is presented in two hardcover versions.

I am also a traditional sculptor, who pushes putty to create pieces for my tabletop fantasy game ArcWorlde: Second Edition, and my driving goal is to recreate the same hand-made, characterful feel with my digitally sculpted miniatures too!\nFor the first Digital Workshop: Printed Kickstarter, I am providing high quality 3D prints of the first 6 months of my digitally sculpted work - Goblins, Dwarves and Bullywugs.\nRather than being cast in resin or metal like other Warploque Miniatures releases, each Digital Workshop: Printed miniature is 3D printed.  These highly detailed resin prints are perfect for painting and table top gaming, as they are strong, flexible and take to paint wonderfully.\n\n\nAn example of our unpainted 3D printed miniatures\nAn example of one of our unpainted 3D printed miniatures\nThe cost of shipping is not included in your pledge, and will be added after the conclusion of the campaign through the pledge manager.\nI will provide you all with full instructions when the time comes. I am still finalising the exact shipping costs, but to give you a rough idea here are a couple of preliminary estimates:\nUK - \u00a34\nGermany - \u00a35\nRest of EU - \u00a310\nUS/Canada - \u00a310\nAustralia - \u00a310\nROW - \u00a310\nThese estimates may increase if you purchase a large number of additional models on top of your core pledge. The final shipping costs are subject to change, and will be based on your location and specific rewards.\nIf you would like to combine your shipping with friends to save on postage, please get in touch and we will be happy to arrange something for you.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAny undertaking of this nature is a huge commitment and a lot of work for everyone involved. Miniatures need printing, packing and eventually shipping to the backers.\n\nIt is at these hurdles that some Kickstarters have faltered in the past, so, I have given careful consideration to each part of the process to minimize potential risk. Warploque Miniatures is a family run business, so everyone involved is 100% dedicated to making this project as successful and professional as possible. \n\nThis is our first 3D printed Kickstarter, and as such there will be a lot to learn. I am working with experienced and extremely talented 3D printing specialists across the world to fulfil this project, with back-up options if there are unexpected delays\n\nAlso, instead of relying purely on concept art and work-in-progress sculpts to illustrate my products, all of the models that I am offering have already been sculpted. They've been printed, the display copies have been painted, and they are ready to go into production, so backers know exactly what they are investing in. \n\nFinally, I have set achievable delivery date estimates. I have kept the campaign small and manageable, eschewing an overly long list of stretch goals, so this project has a much higher probability of being completed and delivered on time.\n\nThis is the 9th Kickstarter that Warploque Miniatures has run, and we have a reputation amongst our community for not only delivering a high quality product, but delivering it on time.

In 2020, together we released dry brushes that helped new and advanced painters take their gaming miniatures to the next level! The combined 4,644 BACKERS most frequently asked question is \"Do you make smaller sizes?\" Well, NOW I DO. If you're ready to join the army of painters, hobbyists, gamers, crafters, terrain builders and artists you found the campaign you were looking for.\nGhosTiny Ultra Fine Detail Paint Brush Set is the answer to the question \"will you make a size #000?\" Instead of a single new brush added to the mega popular Ghost Brush line I wanted to create a set that will be your go to when you need to conquer the smallest of details packed into the wonderful miniatures and models we paint today! You probably already know the feeling of using wonderful new paint brushes but I invite you to join the #GhostBrush community and crush your hobby painting goals!\n \"Art is never finished, only abandoned.\"  Leonardo da Vinci\n\nMy name is Jeff Beyer. We met the last two years when 4,644 Backers gave me their trust and support in helping bring the Ghost Miniature Paintbrushes to life! With online sales, retail shops, and the last two Kickstarter campaigns, thousands of people are painting with these brushes! You can find me on Youtube under the name RedBeardBoss and on Instagram @Sleepwalkair_brush and I love painting. These past years we showed the bigger companies we wanted quality miniature painting supplies at a fair price. I'm not interested in charging you to cover the bill so I can hire big name studio painters in an attempt to convince you these brushes will bring you 1st place golden trophies. I could send every hobby channel on Youtube a free set and pay them to tell you how great these are but I'm not going to do that either. All you have to do is read the comments from the last TWO campaigns and feel proud knowing you are helping build a community of painters and hobbyists who simply love putting paint on little plastic figures.\nPrecision\nWith your support, we will help thousands of new artists fall in love with miniature painting.\nThank you for taking the time to check out my Kickstarter and happy painting!\nI would like to introduce you to the GhosTiny Ultra Fine Detail Miniature Paint Brush Set.\n\nThis new set of 9 ultra fine detail brushes includes 7 rounds, a flat, and a chisel shaped brush. These not only cover you for the smallest of miniature details but imagine the confidence in being able to choose the perfect shape and size for the task! This set is made with the same beloved white nylon hair of the other Ghost Paint Brushes. The birch wood handles of the new GhosTiny range are thicker and more comfortable to hold when you're focused on getting those tiny highlights in those hard to reach spaces.\nAccuracy\nUltra Fine Point\nDon't forget the original Ghost Brush Set\nOriginal 8 round Ghost Brushes and 2 Ghost Dry Brushes\nIf you need a set or two of the original Ghost Brushes I have included pledges just for you! I set out to design the Ghost Brush specifically to help people paint miniatures and people love them! The wide range of sizes were chosen to give you the flexibility to paint the tiniest buckle on your favorite character\u2019s shoe to the massive wings of a terrifying dragon! The white nylon hair holds a nice point compared to most synthetic brushes and is soft enough to achieve smooth blends. Finally, the birch wood handle gives you the feel of being an artist right in your hand. I want you to improve as a painter by having access to quality brushes that get the job done and don't break the bank!\nLet's Make The GHOST Dry Brush Size #0D!\n\nThe new Ghost Dry Brush #0D has already been designed, tested, and I can include once we reach $50,000. This goal may sound high but the last campaign was over triple this amount! This brush is small but packs quite a punch! It has has a thinner handle than the #1D and #2D in this range and is exactly what you asked for. A smaller Ghost Dry Brush! When the stretch goal of $50,000 is obliterated all eligible pledges will have this brush included!!!! The only 2 pledges not eligible will be the Classic Pledges.\n#2D, #1D, #0D\nSome minis are worth spilling paint for! But we won't be spilling any today!\nDesigner @polymorph_miniatures used his ungodly skill to help bring my concept for this amazing new add-on to life! The Necro Paint Pot Holder is the most entrancing way to hold your washes and paints during use to prevent accidentally spilling them. This diabolic creation is resin and will look truly wicked on your paint table. This is a perfect project for your new Ghost Dry Brushes and I can't wait to see how you all paint them to display in your hobby area\nNecro Paint Pot Holder\nFun to paint!\nDo you own a game store?\n\nDo you own a commission paint studio?\n\nDo you need a ton of paintbrushes?\nRetailer Display Rack\nThe retail pledge is for you! You will receive 5 GhosTiny Sets and a 100 Ghost Brushes and a display rack to entice customers! The display rack has 96 holes and I will include some signs with the rack! This pledge is also open for everyone who needs a lot of paintbrushes! If you own a retail store and your customers love these brushes I will be able to fulfill orders right away to keep your display rack full! Don't forget the retail pledges also receive stretch goals earned during the campaign!\nCare for your Ghost Brush\nThe Ghost white nylon hair not only looks great but will help you create better painting habits. Always remember to load the brush with paint only about half way to avoid getting paint in your ferrule. Getting paint inside the ferrule is the fastest way to ruin your brush.\n\nClean your brushes frequently with water and use brush soap after painting to make sure no paint residue is left inside the bristles. The white nylon hair will change color from use but it is good practice when cleaning your brushes to try and get them as clean as possible.\nAll paint brushes are designed to pull paint and this one is no different; however, as miniature painters, we tend to use a stabbing motion with our brushes to push paint into small details. This push motion causes the tip of your synthetic brushes to curl over time. To reduce this, use a pulling motion with your brushes as much as possible and if you absolutely need to push paint into a small area, make sure you use very gentle pressure.\nNEVER leave your Ghost Brush or any paintbrush sitting submerged in water! This will not only destroy your wonderful sharp tip, it will cause the wood handle to swell and ruin your whole brush. Seriously, stop dropping your brushes hair-down inside a water cup. Instead, swish the brush back and forth in the water to remove paint, then wipe on a towel to make sure no paint is left within the bristles.\nThese tips will help your new favorite paintbrush enjoy a longer life.\nGhost Brush Family Photo\nGhost Brush Classic Pledge\nIf you missed out on the first two campaigns these pledges are for YOU. These pledges are for the painter who wants the original sets of Ghost brushes but doesn't want the new GhosTiny set. An advantage of this pledge is the brushes are at a great price, ready to be shipped and will be sent out right away!

This project has almost no risk because I am willing to fully fund the manufacturer to get these brushes made. This is what allows me to keep the goal much lower than total cost of the project. To help ensure a better product and experience to all of my backers, I will double check quality control from the factory. Assuming everything goes smooth, I can begin shipping your orders in July.

Thanks to your overwhelming generosity,  Pine is funded and we met a few stretch goals, ensuring we'll be able to give this story the treatment it deserves! \nThe last 30 days have been amazing. So much so we ran out of superlatives a while ago! Tom and I are truly grateful to be backed by all of you.\nThank you again,\nTom & Najati\nPine is a story-driven game about loss and letting go, told from the perspective of a grieving woodworker. A blend of illustration, animation, music, and sound, Pine tells its story wordlessly through interactions that pull you into the woodworker's experience as he struggles to hold on to his past. \nThe woodworker came to illustrator Tom Booth in a moment of deep isolation following a tragic loss. Initially wary of sharing such a personal work, Tom was overwhelmed by the outpouring of support from friends and fans after he posted the first image of the woodworker. Their own stories of loss let Tom know that he wasn't alone in grieving.\nWe created this campaign so we could tell the woodworker's story with the hope that it can be a reminder to anyone dealing with their own grief that they are not alone.\nPLAY\n\nWe come to Kickstarter to ask for your help in creating something truly meaningful and heartfelt. Thanks to your support, we get to tell the woodworker's story! Help us spread the word so we can make Pine even better by meeting some of our stretch goals! Thank you to all our backers that got us here, and thank you to everyone stopping by for getting us even further!\n\nNot quite a video game and not quite a graphic novel, Pine blends mediums to pull you into the woodworker's world.\nInteractive moments let you share the woodworker's struggles, turning Pine's animated scenes into personal experiences. \nThe sounds of the world and an original score will combine with Pine's visual and interactive moments to bring you deeper into the woodworker's journey. \nNorthwest Soundscapes (Skywalker Sound, Sucker Punch Productions) is helping with sound design, and the score will be written alongside the game. \nHere's a list of the updates that can't be reflected in the reward descriptions, as they get locked after someone chooses them.\nBecause you all met the early funding challenge, all backers will get the bonus landscape of the woodworker's valley as a high-res wallpaper for desktop and mobile!\nEveryone who was part of the first 80k will get the exclusive soundscape, too.\nThere will be a total of seven prints to choose from: five of Tom's classic illustrations of the woodworker and two new images exclusive to the Kickstarter. Check out Update #4 to see the five that have been revealed!\nThere are add-ons for print bundles, carving mini figures, and the STL of the woodworkers.\nSee the designs for the carving mini figures in Update #7.\nCheck out past updates to see what's been going on with the campaign. Help us make Pine even better by spreading the word and sharing Pine with friends and fans of graphic novels and games!\nTom drew the first illustration of the woodworker over a long night late in the winter of 2019. It was the most personal thing he'd ever drawn, and Tom almost didn't share the image. \nOriginal sketch of woodworker. February 2019\nWhen he did, the response was overwhelming. Despite being born from an extremely personal experience, the woodworker resonated deeply with Tom's audience.\nThere was an outpouring of support from his fans, many of them thanking him for sharing the image. Some were so inspired that they created truly spectacular 3D models, fan drawings, and actual wood carvings\u2014a few even got tattoos!  \nAs Tom posted more images, the woodworker found his way around the internet. From the front page of Reddit to My Modern Met, everywhere the woodworker went, people wanted to know more about him. It was clear that Tom had found a story that needed to be told.\nIn the spring of 2019 we started brainstorming how to tell this story in a special way. Inspired by titles like Florence and, later, If Found..., we thought a story-driven game would be perfect for Pine.  \nSample of thumbnail storyboards.\nSince then we've fleshed out the rest of the story, storyboarded it, built a few prototypes, worked up enough courage to quit our day jobs, founded a company, and made a lovely version of FreeCell to get some practice publishing mobile games. It's been a busy couple of years!\nPrototyping one of Pine's interactive scenes\nEven with all that done, the work is really just beginning. We think there's a little over a year of work left on Pine, full of drawing, animating, programming, composing music, putting it all together, and testing.\nThat's what the funding from this campaign will allow us to do.\n\nAt our lowest funding goal, Pine will be released on iOS and Android. Release on Steam and Switch are stretch goals. All backers that pledge $5 or more will be able to play Pine on the platform of their choice.\nWe don't want to be presumptuous about how this campaign will go, but we do want to make sure that whatever we raise past our goal will go towards making Pine even better. For more info on the project budget, see the section after the rewards.\n* See the note in \"Risks and challenges\" below about publishing to the Switch.\nWe hope the rewards convey how much your support means to us. Every pledge receives our deepest appreciation and we tried to make each reward a meaningful new way to experience Pine. \nLook below the reward tree for details on the limited rewards.\nThe Backer Forest is our way to say a special thank you to those who play a big role in bringing Pine to life. After finishing Pine, you'll be able to explore the forest and maybe find your name there, along with everyone else who made a sizable contribution to the campaign.\nWe've also added a few add-ons since launching the campaign! The second and third are only available with reward tiers that already have a physical component.\n Woodworker carving STL file: This is the 3D model of the woodworker by Ismael Nieto. We had a couple requests for this add-on so that backers with their own 3D printers could print their own woodworker. For personal use only, of course!\n Additional prints and print bundles: If you've been reading the updates you know that there are now going to be a total of 7 images to select from. These add-ons let you get all the prints you want with your pledge! \n Additional carving mini figures: Our backers in the US can also add an additional carving mini figure to their pledge.\nThese handsome prints will be equally at home in your game room or museum room. Choose from the seven print options or let us know if there's a different image you have in mind and we'll see what we can do!\nThese prints will be signed by Tom and include a personal thank you note from him and Najati. You'll also get thanked in the credits after the story.\nYou're right, that woodworker figure isn't painted ... yet! When we were initially brainstorming ideas for this Kickstarter, the one thing we knew right away was that this amazing figure by Ismael Nieto (@ismaflcl) had to be one of the rewards.\nWe decided to take it one step further by having Tom paint them, making it a truly exceptional keepsake. Like the signed print, you'll get a personal thank you note from Tom and Najati and thanked in the credits after the story.\nTom's artistic talents aren't limited to the tablet. On special occasions he takes brush to canvas and putting Pine on Kickstarter is a very special occasion, indeed!\nThose able to support at this level will get one of five original paintings of a scene exclusive to this reward. These will be gouache on cold pressed paper and will ship ready for display or framing as you see fit!\nOf course, these include a thank you note from Tom and Najati and your name in the credits after the story. And yes, Tom has a lot of painting in store if we get funded!\nAnyone able to contribute at this level will be key to making Pine a reality! Your name will appear alongside the team at the beginning of the story, either as an individual or as a group. \nIn addition to getting one of every print and mini figure, you'll also get to choose one of the other limited rewards, and will of course get a thank you note from Tom and Najati. \nWe'd also like to say thank you directly and learn about why supporting Pine meant so much to you. So, if you're interested, we'll arrange a time for a video call with you.\nThe 8.5x11\" prints will ship worldwide through Fulfillrite, with tracking where possible, and delivered with duties paid where possible. If you live outside the list of countries where that service is available, you will be responsible for additional costs such as taxes and duties. Please check the FAQ to see which countries include duties paid.\nThe rest of the rewards are things we'll be making or packing ourselves and are limited in number. Since we're a small team, they'll only be available for shipping to the United States, with the exception of the Associate Producer rewards, which we'll ship worldwide.\nWe already have partners set up for making the physical rewards. Because some of those rewards depend on art that hasn't been created yet (e.g. the exclusive images for the wallpaper pack and Art of Pine PDF), we'll be developing those pieces first so we can get reward production and delivery started as soon as possible. \nSoon after funding, we'll publish an anticipated delivery schedule for the rewards. We're hoping the 8.5x11\" prints will ship over the summer and we're targeting shipping everything else before the holidays season of 2021.\nIn the spirit of transparency and community, we want to give potential backers some insight into our approach to funding and budgeting. There aren't any lovely images in this section but it's important to us that those pledging understand how we're using their money to develop Pine.\nFirst and foremost, our primary goal is to develop a high-quality, engaging, meaningful story-driven game so that you can experience the woodworker's story.\nWhile we'd love to just work on Pine and release it when it's ready without worrying about money, Pine is too big of a project to whittle away at in the evening and on weekends.\nWe think we've got about 15 months of work to do and we need to hire some outside help. The Kickstarter funding goes primarily towards hiring that help and enabling us to spend the time doing the work.\nHere's how the basic budget breaks down. These are estimates, but should be close to how the money gets spent.\n Kickstarter fees: 8% - We wouldn't be here without them!\n Rewards and shipping: 10% - Making and shipping the rewards \n Legal, accounting, etc: 2% - All companies need a little of this stuff\n Taxes: 15% - An estimate, and perhaps a conservative one\n Sound and music: 15% - Producing SFX and the score\n Art and programming: 50% - Most of what Pine needs is time for Tom and Najati to work on it!\nIf we're lucky enough to achieve any of our stretch goals, funding them comes out of the art and programming portion of the budget.\nAt our lowest goal of $80k, this is a shoestring budget even for a small team. However, everyone is committed to the project and we think that's just enough money to make a great game. For anyone curious, the project needs to reach about $300,000 before Tom and Najati aren't spending their savings to develop Pine. Any money beyond that would be invested back into Made Up Games so we can make more games!\nSo that's how your pledges will help us make Pine and, again, we're grateful for every one. If you made it this far, thanks for sticking around through this really boring section about money!\n\nMade Up Games is Tom Booth and Najati Imam. We're both lifelong gamers and longtime friends. After some practice publishing games with Freecell Fable\u2014and with your help\u2014we're ready to take on Pine!\nTom\u2019s been drawing since childhood and has been a professional illustrator for about 10 years, including stints at Nickelodeon and Scholastic. He's illustrated and authored a number of children\u2019s books including Don't Blink! and This is Christmas. His Instagram audience and its love for the woodworker is a large part of what inspired us to start this campaign!\n\nNajati\u2019s been programming since he was a kid and has been doing so professionally for over 20 years. His experience runs the gamut from web front end, to embedded systems programming, to directing engineering departments. He\u2019s also been tinkering with game dev for as long as he\u2019s been able to type. \n\nAndy's an industry vet who records forests for fun. He's the perfect person to weave the sounds of the woodworker's valley into the storytelling. Owner of Northwest Soundscapes, he's done sound design work for Lucasfilm and Sucker Punch Productions, among others.\n\nAdam is one part programmer, one part actor, and one part team coach. He and Najati used to work together so when it was time to blend technology, feelings, and art we pulled him into the team to keep us focused and keep the quality high.\n\nTwo parting notes ...\nWe expect it's clear from the tone of the campaign that Pine attempts to explore a fairly serious topic. While we want it to be a story that most anyone will be able to relate to, and maybe even feel enriched by, it's not intended to be a children's story. Because there won't be anything graphic or violent in it, Pine may end up with an E rating. We added this note to make sure that parents don't mistakenly take that to mean that Pine is intended for children.\nAlso, Made Up Games does not condone carving things into trees\u2014please don't do that! In a lot of places it's illegal, but even more importantly it can be really bad for the tree. The woodworker's story is a fictional one and he would definitely take forest conservation very seriously if he were real.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe biggest risk we foresee is whether we've estimated for enough time to live up to the high expectations we have for this project. We're confident in our ability to deliver, and we did our best to be reasonable with our estimates, but game development is a wily beast! We have contingency plans, but it would be na\u00efve to assume there won't be a few surprises along the way.\n\nSpeaking of surprises, there shouldn't be many for our backers as we're committed to being very transparent throughout the development of Pine. The dev updates will include progress on all fronts, from making and shipping the rewards to setbacks and successes during the development of Pine.\n\nRegarding publishing to the Switch: The barriers of entry to developing for the Nintendo Switch can be fairly high, with Nintendo controlling access to it tightly. If the project reaches that level of funding, we'll have resources available to tackle those challenges. Still, working with Nintendo is a considerable external dependency that we don't have complete control over.\n\nOur experience in fulfillment of physical goods is somewhat limited, but we've done our homework and think we've covered our bases there. We're confident in the partners we've selected to work with to produce the rewards and working with Fulfillrite removes all the risk around the shipping of the prints.\n\nWe're excited to bring Pine into the world. We're happy with the story we've written, our approach to telling it, and keen on our ability to execute. Risks exist, but we're ready to take on the challenges we face to make Pine a reality.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nReusability and recyclability\nWhere possible, shipping materials will be recycled and/or recyclable.\nSomething else\nFor all tiers above $25, we\u2019ll plant a tree for every backer that supports the project.

Moving here exposed the Gnomes to new creatures, new tools and of course the magick that weaves through the Darkewood.

With your help in funding this project not only will we be able to answer some of these burning questions but we will also be able to bring a whole heap of brand new Northumbrian Tin Minis into production for general release next year. \nWe spent a fair amount of time considering how these gnomes fit into the world along with the rest of the Nightfolk and the Denizens of the Wood and so to help you bring a little bit more of that world to life they also come equipped with a small free digital adventure. Rumor has it that our author Ken became so engaged with the characters and lore that he built a whole campaign around it, which he may or may not have committed to paper - we shall have to see!\nWe have 8 Gnomes and 5 Toads as well as an epic Toad mounted Deathstealer, Several stretch goals which include Additional free Minis!\n\nWhat do you get out of this? Well, you can get all of those fantastic miniatures we just mentioned and some addons with a fantastic discount on the usual retail price and perhaps bag yourself some free stretch goals on top!  You also get to lend us a hand in shaping these characters and the lore that surrounds them. All Miniatures and Bases are supplied unpainted.\n\n\nThere are Three straightforward pledges to choose from an you can upgrade your pledge at any time:\n Surface Dweller - Pick out what you want from the Addons and then pledge the amount, you will be able to finalise your choices in the pledge manager.\n Gnomeward Bound - Get everything from the Gnomes and Toads packs along with the EPIC Death Stealer Gnome mounted on a Stygian Toad, a Northumbrian Tin presentation box and all unlocked stretch goals! \n There's no place like Gnome - Get two sets of the toad pack, The Gnome pack, The EPIC Death Stealer Gnome and Mount, The Gnome More MR Nice Guys Addon, a pack of Toadshrooms, a Northumbrian Tin presentation box and all unlocked stretch goals!\nIf you took part in our last project on Kickstarter you will already know how committed we are to delivering an outstanding product that exceeds your expectations, if you missed our last project and are joining in on this one, prepare to be pleasantly surprised!\n\nWe have prepared a number of stretch goals which if hit will be included for free in any of the qualifying pledges.

As soon as the Kickstarter funds are received the Miniatures can be put straight into production and then shipped shortly after the pledge manager is completed. Northumbrian Tin Soldier is already a successful manufacturer and online retailer of miniatures, we have many years of experience of designing, producing and shipping models all over the world. \n\nImpacts of Covid-19 on Production and Shipping - We were recently impacted quite heavily by the Coronavirus restrictions imposed in the UK earlier in the year. This led to unforseen delays in the fulfillment of our recent successful Kickstarter project \"The Curious Case of the Cats of Crumptown\" , however we adapted our delivery plans and learned a great deal about how to operate under very adverse conditions. Postal issues were solved by using Courier services at no additional costs to our backers , Stock was collected via our own transport and fullfillment was only delayed by a matter of weeks . As before all Miniatures will be produced in the UK which will mitigate any international production risks. We have extended the project delivery timescale by 2 months over what our estimates are of what is needed to allow for any unforseen changes in UK operations.\n\nIn the case of any delays caused by factors outside of our control you can expect to receive transparent and honest updates from us.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nLong-lasting design\nMetal miniatures can be used, re-used then used some more.

''Any other logical advice you can spare Hartigan?!'' Tulsa said sarcastically... '' I got plenty of bullets and know exactly where to put them...!'' \n\nWelcome everyone to the Kickstarter campaign for Cyber City. This campaign will focus on two brand new 75mm miniatures in the form of Tulsa and Hartigan and a 1/10th bust called Katana. Making an appearance also are the Slugger and Gunslinger busts and their 75mm miniatures versions. We also have their STL files available in one big pack! \nAll the figures in this campaign have been expertly sculpted by my good friend Daniel Ciorba and give off that cyberpunk feel we love. We hope you like what you see and help us get these into production.\n\nKatana\nFirst up is Katana, a 1/10th bust (roughly 85mm). She is an expert swordfighter who is just about unsheath her blade and do some serious damage! Below you see the box art painted by Sylvain Aubut and the first cast by Aur\u00e9lien Diot of Deep Space Factory Productions.\nTulsa & Hartigan\nThen we have the two 75mm miniatures. Experienced detectives who are the law and order of Cyber City! When I designed these two with Daniel I had them planned to be great on their own but also as a duo. You can place them back to back, loyal partners to the end. I think Daniel nailed it and they make a fine couple!\nHartigan\nTulsa\nAdd-ons\nAlso making a feature this campaign are the busts and 75mm miniatures versions of Slugger and Gunslinger. The busts have been out for a while now and the 75mm miniatures made a little appearance in the Studio X Kickstarter that ran earlier this year. They fit perfectly in this campaign though and haven't had much spotlight just yet so hence our decision to include them.\nAll sculpts by my good friend Daniel Ciorba! :D\nBelow are just the front angles of the miniatures and busts.

For all pledges it is \u20ac10,- which includes tracking & and insurance.\nWe have set the delivery date for March 2021 but depending on the number of casts we need, it might be sooner. Casting will begin once the campaign is over and only if we have funded.\nThe company who handles our shipping proved numerous times already that they do a good job. We have every faith we can deliver on time as we have become quite good at organizing and packing. We don't think there will be a delay in packages going out to backers but would just like to add that delays can happen. Once the shipping company has your parcels, it is out of our control. However we will do everything possible again to fulfill this Kickstarter on time.\nPackages can take anywhere from 4-28 (or sometimes even longer!) days to arrive. So please give it some time when we have announced that the packages have been shipped. Especially with the Covid-19, shipping times can be bit longer than usual. We ask for your understanding if this causes any delays.\nPlease note that we are not responsible for any customs or other fees that might occur. We do not ship to P.O. boxes!\nMiniatures come unpainted and need assembly and some cleaning. They are not toys and might take some expertise to put together.\nBrexit\nAs you may or may not know, The UK will leave the EU soon. As of yet, a deal for trade and import/export hasn't been made yet. We have no clue about what will happen but we will make sure we have some channels set up to aid us in delivering packages to our backers in the UK. Obviously we will keep you informed at all times. One thing is sure, you will get your pledges!!!\nSTL files\nThe STL files will be send out once the period for processing funds by Kickstarter is over and funds have been received in our bank account. This normally takes two to three weeks and we estimate that the files will be delivered early January at the latest.\nAs always there are a few people we would like to thank.

Anyaral is the setting for the fantasy skirmish game of Twilight, which I have been working on for over 20 years now. In this world, the diminutive Fubarnii have pulled themselves out of slavery and carved an Empire that spans the continent of Anyaral. That Empire is now threatened by their Delgon cousins, who have descended from their mountain strongholds led by their gods, the Enarii. \nI'll admit that I hadn't planned to launch this campaign until recently, but this year has been anything but predictable... Over the last few months (and years) I've been working on a large project to unleash the new Kedashi force on the world of Anyaral, but with everything that has been going on this year, it didn't feel like quite the right time to run such a big endeavour. However, alongside all the Kedashi planning I had a few little fun sculpting projects on the side. These were models I really wanted to sculpt, but I didn't quite have a plan for, so I've decided to take the opportunity to release those as a little pre-Christmas kickstarter!\nLet me introduce the three subjects of this little campaign, each of which has been given their own pledge level. You can of course add on extras if you don't want just one model.\nAlaim is one of the powerful Enarii who the Delgon invaders have embraced as their gods. Alaim however shunned godhood and instead became an outcast and fled to the southern lands of the Casanii. \nAlaim has chosen to follow the migratory life of the Casanii, renouncing claims of leadership and seeking to learn from these spiritual warriors. The Casanii tribes were unsure at first of this intruding giant, but the shamans communed with their spirits and saw the openness of Alaim's heart and the strength that might be added to their tribes. \nAlaim is cast in resin and provided unpainted with a 50mm plastic base.\nUnder the watchful eye of NuraSen Plutom, the Delgon have embraced the mechanical wonders that were once just toys for the engineers of the Empire. The KalMalog have become a regular sight in the ongoing war, but the larger designs have proven more difficult to mass produce. Only recently has this new variant been seen. These monstrosities wield a pair of derakar, using the might of the heavy engine to power both the mechanical legs and the guns. \nThe Heavy KalMalog is cast in resin and provided unpainted with a 50mm plastic base.\nThe skerrats make their homes throughout the continent of Anyaral. The Dhogu tribes train them, but they are seen as a nuisance across the rest of the Empire, raiding food supplies and damaging property. However, that doesn't stop the rare broodmothers from being highly sought after. Nearly all species of skerrat continue to grow throughout the sempa stage of their lifecycle, only slowing once they mature into kopa. It is rare, but some skerrats will live for many decades as sempa, raising vast broods of skerrats. These skerrat broodmothers are almost impossible to raise in captivity, but are highly valued creatures.

Although brave and determined, adventurers are only human! They are prone to the madness and pain the twisted dwellers of the dungeons will inflict upon them. Death can occur, but is not the worst fate: heroes can be driven mad and beyond help!\nPlease note minis come unpainted.\nThe game is played in campaigns of 11 missions. To reach the Darkest Dungeon itself, players will undertake 3 missions per threat level and vanquish the boss. Then, they will be strong enough to face the horrors of the Darkest Dungeon! They may emerge victorious... if they dispatch the source of evil that plagues the land.\nPlease note minis come unpainted.\nFor each hero, select 3 skills out of 7 before heading into your mission (and level the heroes up to gain access to more skills). In each room, pick the most suitable stance to best resolve the conflict! Then, on each turn, a player chooses two of the available actions of moving, interacting with the environment, changing their stance or using a skill (if eligible for their current stance). Triumph over encounters, resist rampant madness and emerge victorious before throwing yourself into another battle. Between missions, spend your time in the hamlet, visiting various buildings to find relief from the physical and mental trauma you\u2019ve just endured. Restore the hamlet to its former glory and it will reward you and help you to fulfill the ultimate goal.\nRPG-like heroes  \u2013 A robust level up system with a ton of customization for unique playable characters.\nStressful Affliction System \u2013 Heroes' personalities are paramount!

We want to ensure that we have the space to deal with any unexpected setbacks and still get your game to you before the estimated delivery date.\n\nTo give you a frame of reference for exactly when you will get your game, Mythic Battles: Pantheon, Time of Legends: Joan of Arc season 1 and Reichbusters: Projekt Vril have been delivered. Super Fantasy Brawl is going to complete fulfillment by the end of the month. Solomon Kane, a big scope project, is at the printer and will be delivered in two waves. In specific wave 1 is in mass production now and the wave 2 moulds are also now being produced. Time of Legends: Joan of Arc season 1.5 is on track and the first elements will be soon sent to production. Enchanters: East Quest has been printed and is going to ship this month.

They lived in huge sounders and held council with the other forest tribes. Now they are but a shadow of what they were, finding work where they can as bodyguards, pit-fighters and mercenaries.\nD\u00fcnnmere is an original fantasy setting inspired by dark folklore. It is filled with all manner of odd critters and characters, and with this Kickstarter I wanted to shed some light on a few of its inhabitants.\nThe Miniatures\nMy miniatures are sculpted digitally, then 3d printed and cast in high quality resin. The five main figures (Gl\u00f6mm the Collector, Gruntlac Gatecrusher, Gorgrot, Porgroth the Gluttonous and Olaug) come with 40mm round bases. \nMaggot and Rollo are available as add-ons and come with 25mm round bases.  To add them to your pledge simply add \u00a38 for each one you'd like and at the end of the Kickstarter you will be asked which add-ons you would like.\nThe three pigs each come with an alternative bare-head.\nThe miniatures are 28mm scale and are made to be compatible with ranges like Dungeons and Dragons, Age of Sigmar, Frostgrave and any other 28mm miniature based games.\nRollo the Masterful painted\nEvery miniature comes with an illustrated card, with some backstory about the character and signed by the artist.\nOne of the original ink drawings available in the Artisan Band tiers.\nShipping & Delivery\nOnce you have chosen your pledge, you will be asked to add on costs for shipping. Any pledge above Hermit will be tracked shipping and so will cost a bit extra. \nDelivery will be completed by March 2021 or possibly sooner.\nWhy back the Kickstarter?\nYou'll be helping me to develop and grow the dark folklore-inspired setting of D\u00fcnnmere further.\n You'll receive the miniatures at a reduced price (if you order any pledge higher than Hermit). \nOwn miniatures from the first casting. Each figure from the first casting is limited to 200 or 300 copies and the illustrated card will show which number from the casting that you have.\nYou'll receive the miniatures several months before they become available elsewhere.\nYou'll be supporting my tiny independent miniatures studio, and helping it to take its first steps.\nAbout\nHi, I\u2019m Jack Good and Monkstone Miniatures is my own little creation. I design, sculpt and illustrate each character, and am writing and developing the setting too.  As a child, I loved stories and films about fantasy worlds like Willow and the Dark Crystal, and they massively influenced my own drawings and stories. I collected Citadel miniatures too, and was always drawn to the smaller games like Mordheim and Warhammer Quest. \nI graduated from the Computer Visualisation and Animation degree at Bournemouth University in 2009 and have been lucky enough to have had an almost ten year career in the video game industry making art. Highlights of this include being on the four-person team that created the Bafta nominated \u2018Surgeon Simulator 2013\u2019 and leading the art on 'Worlds Adrift'.\nLast year I found myself once again being drawn back to painting minis, and realised I also wanted to sculpt my own characters and to create a world inspired by my loves of folklore, fantasy and history. My aim is to expand the setting of D\u00fcnnmere, and to eventually develop stories, games and rulesets to enable you to explore these lands for yourselves.\nMy focus right now though is on developing the highest quality 28mm resin miniatures for you to use in whatever fantasy setting you choose.\nThis is my first Kickstarter, and with your support it will hopefully be the first step in our journey together. I am hugely passionate about this project and have big plans for its future.\nI really appreciate your support\nThank you\n- Jack\n\n\nAcknowledgements\nMassive thanks to Eddie Fisher and the team at Zealot Miniatures for helping to bring my miniatures to life in such amazing detail.

At her feet, three cloth kittens scampered and played as she swept the floor, stoked the fire and straightened the furniture. They were to have visitors. Bundled out of the cottage by the old woman, the kittens darted through the rain and across the clearing to the shelter of the woodshed. A low mournful moan slid through the slatted wood of the shed. The kittens looked at each other, then bolted straight back to the house. Small pebble eyes watched them go.\u201d\nLeft at the Bottom of the Garden Chapter Two is a project to fund the production of nine high quality, lead-free metal miniatures, each depicting a lost toy. Following on from my previous Kickstarter, our intrepid lost toys have met a new group of toys deep in the forest: the old woman who lives in the woods, her various cloth cats, a toy robin and whatever it is she keeps in the woodshed. \nAs the owner and sculptor of Statuesque Miniatures, I've produced many miniatures over the years. However, the Left at the Bottom of the Garden toys are something quite different in style and purpose from my usual work and that's why I've again come to Kickstarter to help reach as many people as possible.  The first Left at the Bottom of the Garden Kickstarter (which I now call 'Chapter One') was successful and fulfilled on time. With your help, I can get production started and continue the tale of Olive, Clementine and Little Puss, and all the other toys they meet in the woods.\nThe Miniatures\nMeasuring approximately 13mm to 31mm tall, the Left at the Bottom of the Garden Chapter Two miniatures represent the household of the old woman who lives in the woods - mostly cloth cats. I sculpted the miniatures with tabletop gaming, painting and collecting in mind. In particular, I wanted them to be nice little objects in themselves, needing no glue, no assembly beyond normal casting clean-up, and no plastic bases. They have bold, chunky details meaning they can be easily painted or finished however you wish.\nAll photos show production castings of the miniatures (either painted or prepped and given a wash of oil paint to bring out the details), so if the Kickstarter is successful I'll be ready to start casting your miniatures immediately. There won't be any stretch goals or additional items added during the course of the campaign - I don't want anything to delay fulfilment.\nPlease note, due to their small size the Left at the Bottom of the Garden miniatures are not intended for small children.\nThe Pledges\nBelow you can see each of the pledge levels available. All miniatures are supplied in a bare metal state.\nChoose any set or sets of miniatures from the Add On list below. Simply pledge the total for those sets. Details of your choices will be taken after the campaign.\nThe complete set of nine Left at the Bottom of the Garden Chapter Two miniatures, cast in high quality, lead-free metal.\nAdditional sets of miniatures can also be chosen from the Add On list below. Simply add the total cost for those sets to the pledge level.

Simply add the total cost for those sets to the pledge level. Details of your choices will be taken after the campaign.\nAdd Ons\nThe following items can be added to any pledge for the amount indicated.

Full details of the shipping costs can be seen HERE on the Statuesque website but below is a summary:\n United Kingdom - \u00a32.70\n Europe - \u00a34.30 standard mail or \u00a310.85 tracked\n World Zone 1 - \u00a35.50 standard mail or \u00a310.65 tracked\n World Zone 2 (including Aus and NZ) - \u00a36.30 standard mail or \u00a311.45 tracked\n World Zone 3 (USA only) - \u00a35.55 standard mail or \u00a310.75 tracked\nPledges over \u00a350 will be sent by tracked mail (where available) for the standard mail shipping cost.\nPlease note, experience has taught me that it is best to send orders to certain counties only by International Tracked services (or if unavailable, International Signed) to ensure prompt delivery. All rewards sent to Russia (Europe shipping), Brazil and Canada (World Zone 1) will be sent by International Tracked mail only and charged appropriately, while rewards sent to Mexico (World Zone 1) will be sent by International Signed mail only and charged appropriately. No criticism of these countries is implied; I just want you to get your rewards as quickly as possible and I've found this to be the best way.\nShipping costs will be collected after the Kickstarter through the Statuesque Miniatures webshop: you will receive a discount coupon to the value of your pledge amount, you will then place an order for your chosen rewards, and upon entering your discount coupon code you will only pay for the shipping costs (and any additional items you may wish to purchase).\nIt is very important that you check your Kickstarter messages as that is where I will send your discount coupons and information regarding the payment of shipping costs. Please be sure that your Kickstarter account is linked to an email account you check regularly and turn on notifications for Kickstarter messages.\nShipping to the European Union\nPlease note that while the United Kingdom left the EU on the 31st of January 2020, during the Transition Period it remains in the EU Customs Union and the Single Market.\nThe Transition Period runs until the 31st of December 2020. As this Kickstarter will be fulfilled during the Transition Period, EU backers' rewards will not be subject to VAT, customs charges or handling fees on import into the EU. As such, this project is EU Friendly.\nI'll be posting more photos of the painted toys during the campaign, along with a tutorial on how I painted them.

The first player to have one of their souls reach the land of the living wins!\nWelcome to the journey from the world of the dead to the land of the living... \nWe have worked with a cultural consultant and a Mexican artist to really help bring Dia de Muertos to the table and embed the beauty and culture within the game. This has resulted in amazing components, such as our four gorgeous Dia de Muertos caskets, and the 3D nine-step staircase, showing the levels the souls travel on from the World of the Dead to the Land of the Living; as well as papel picado player boards, ofrenda tokens and custom calavera dice. All of these will be used by players as they add souls to the caskets, move the caskets towards the steps, and ascend the steps to the land of the living. Die of the Dead is fully playtested and print ready, so we will be able to get it in people's hands by Dia de Muertos 2021! \nFor full rules please check out our current rulebook here: Rules (prototype) . For a full overview please check out this fantastic Chits and Giggles video here\nThe goal for each player is to get a soul (represented by the dice) to the land of the living. Players do this by adding souls to the caskets, moving the caskets, and then transferring the souls from the casket to the steps.\nOn a player's turn they choose one of the four caskets. Each casket will do two things, depending upon its location. One will benefit the current player, the other will depend upon the shake of the casket, and could be good, or bad, for all players around the table. Some of the things the caskets allow players to do are:\nPlayers need to consider carefully which caskets they have souls in when deciding which action they wish to do that round, and how they can manoeuvre the caskets to help them win!\nIn addition, players can gain tokens representing the items from an ofrenda to help them. \nOfrenda tokens\nThese will give the player who uses them an edge, or let them change the rules in some way. \nEverything you see here\nWe're keeping things simple this Kickstarter- everyone who backs the game gets the best version of the game. No different tiers or having to buy expansions before trying out the game. \nIn order to make sure this game reaches people before Dia de Muertos 2021 we have chosen realistic stretch goals which won't need any additional playtesting, or add any cost to the shipping of the game.\nUnlocked: At \u00a39000 we will upgrade the box art so it looks even better by adding UV spot printing.\nUnlocked: At \u00a312000 we will upgrade from screen-printed custom dice to engraved custom dice.\nAnd that's it! Only two stretch goals might seem a small number, but the game is complete, and the last thing we want to do is unbalance it, or make it more expensive to ship. If we do end up far exceeding these then we will put any savings towards subsidising shipping rates even further.\nAt Radical 8 Games we understand that shipping can be a barrier to backing a game, especially considering the uncertainty around the world at the moment. Therefore we make this guarantee that, no matter what, for UK and US backers the cost of the game & shipping will be less than the MSRP. We would love to be able to offer this to everybody, but we cant guarantee this to be the case with the fees involved in other countries, although we will be offering as cost effective shipping as possible, including a subsidy from us to keep costs down.\nAll shipping will be charged in the pledge manager after the campaign has ended. All UK, European, American, Canadian and Australian shipping will be done from within that region for friendly shipping.\nUpdate 1st September: We have a new fulfilment partner for customers in China and some other  regions. We can now offer estimated shipping to China for $9, and Japan,  South Korea, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, South Africa, Taiwan,  Thailand & Vietnam for $18.\n*Excluding Alaska and Hawaii.\n**For more information please just send us a message. \nFor Mexico we have chosen to take the steps to subsidise shipping further, we estimate this to be around \u00a313. Please see our most recent update for more on this.\nPlease check out some videos and thoughts on the game from other people!\nFor Chits & Giggles have a superb overview here: \nCard and Pixel have an excellent write up here: https://cardandpixel.tumblr.com/post/626960669850451969/die-of-the-dead-a-kickstarter-preview\nThe Dice Tower have a great in-depth overview here: \nTantrum House have done a wonderful preview in their own inimitable style (don't forget to check out their outtakes):  \n Board, Deck and Dice have a nice quick overview here: \nHere's an interview we did for Kicking Tables, discussing the game, from conception to production:  \n Update 10th September:\nAnother great preview, this time from the Hairy Game Lords:\nFinally Richard from We're Not Wizards has another excellent written preview:\nhttps://werenotwizards.blogspot.com/2020/09/die-of-dead-radical-8-games-kickstarter.html \nHere's a playthrough we recorded, we've edited out the setup and rules introduction, but hopefully it gives you a sense of how fun the game is (thanks to Nate and Angel for volunteering to be recorded playing)\nIn addition, if you're interested in reading about how the game was designed, and the thought that went into each part, you can check out our designer diaries on BoardGameGeek or our Website.\nA massive Thank You to everybody above for their efforts!\nOne thing we'd like to do is include all our backers in the choice of new colours for the Casket Boards. The current colours introduce the misconception that they are related to the token boards, because the colours match. To avoid this, and make the game even more colourful, we will be using four different colours for the casket boards. This is where you come in. Below we've got some examples of possible colours we could use for the casket boards: \nIf any of these strike your fancy, or if there are other colours you'd like to see, please let us know, either in the comments, or in our online poll! At the end of the campaign we will choose the four most popular contrasting colours. So just tell us your favourites, and together we'll make sure the game looks even more beautiful.\nIn addition, you can join us on Twitter or Facebook, using the buttons below:\nRadical 8 Games is an independent publisher based in York, UK. Our last Kickstarted game, Forks, was funded, manufactured and fulfilled all ahead of schedule in August 2019. Radical 8 Games is run by Mark, who pre-lockdown spent most his time at Beyond Monopoly! boardgame club playing Agricola when he wasn't playtesting Die of the Dead. Designer James Allen runs Leeds Playtesting with Playtest UK, and has worked hard not only on his own games, but improving games for all designers in the group. Rusembell is an exceptional artist from Mexico, and you can check out more of her amazing artwork here: https://www.deviantart.com/rusembell.\nThanks to the following: all our playtesters, everyone who supports Playtest UK, everyone at Beyond Monopoly (especially those who had to put up with Mark forcing people to play some of those early builds), the HGS boardgame club, Angel for the bread, Jason, Will & Sean for 'Wellbeing Wednesdays' and everyone who stopped by for a chat at Airecon or Virtual UKGE.\nAnd you, for supporting us!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhilst this is our second Kickstarter, and we successfully fulfilled our first quickly and efficiently, there are two things which may crop up as challenges regarding this project, and it would be foolish to not acknowledge them: Brexit and Covid-19.\n\nIf a second wave of Covid-19 hits there will be two possible results. Either delays in manufacturing, or increased costs to shipping. What we can do about delays in manufacturing is very limited, and although we hope we have built in enough spare time to still meet the deadline of Dia de Muertos 2021, if there are delays we promise to keep everyone updated at least once every two weeks regarding them.\nIf there is an increased cost to shipping we will look to bear that burden ourselves. Again, all backers will be kept updated with anything that might happen regarding a second wave of Covid-19.\n\nBrexit is only of concern to UK backers- we will be using fulfilment centres in all parts of the world including the EU, so only UK backers would be affected by this. As we are expecting a significant number of backers to come from the UK, this shouldn't actually affect anybody too badly, as making sure games get here will be a priority. We are working with fulfilment centres in the UK, and will keep on talking to them about Brexit, especially as more is known. Again, the main issues will be increased shipping costs and possible delays, but as Radical 8 Games is based in the UK, we will be working overtime to make sure the games get here with minimum delays and will bear any additional costs.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nSomething else\nWe won't be using a plastic tray in Die of the Dead.

Miniatures need sculpting, manufacturing, packing and eventually shipping to the backers.\n\nIt is at these hurdles that some Kickstarters have faltered in the past, so, I have given careful consideration to each part of the process to minimise potential risk. Warploque Miniatures is a family run business, so everyone involved is 100% dedicated to making this project as successful and professional as possible. My father is our resin caster, my mother is in charge of packing and shipment, and our metal caster is a tried and tested craftsman we have worked with for over four years.\n\nAlso, instead of relying purely on concept art and work-in-progress sculpts to illustrate my products, all of the initial models that I am offering have already been sculpted. They've been cast, the display copies have been painted, and they are ready to go into production, so backers know exactly what they are investing in. I will be relying on Work in Progress sculpts and concept art for some of the stretch goals, but be assured that they will be completed and cast in a timely manner once the campaign has been funded.\n\nFinally, I have set achievable delivery date estimates. I have kept the campaign small and manageable, eschewing an overly long list of stretch goals, so this project has a much higher probability of being completed and delivered on time.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nLong-lasting design\nWe only use the best materials for our miniatures, which are sturdy and durable for extended gaming sessions.\nEnvironmentally friendly factories\nAll Warploque Miniatures products are manufactured locally in the UK by local craftsmen.\nSomething else\nAll Warploque Miniatures products are manufactured locally by local craftsmen.", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a31 or more", "title": "(1.1) TREASURE MAP", "descp": "The start of your adventures into ArcWorlde, or maybe a new path...\nJust fancy a particular model?

Having just joined the Wonderful Ones after finishing a year of comprehensive training, Earth Defense War III is his first experience in combat.\nThough technically still a rookie, he is extremely gifted, achieving a record score in both the written and field sections of the CENTINEL tactical examinations. Brimming with passion for justice, he takes a firm stance against those who threaten peace, but his by the books attitude and serious personality can occasionally rub people the wrong way. Sometimes Red's seriousness crosses the realm of reason, and those around him find getting through to him almost impossible. The opposite is rarer, though, as Red has an incredible memory, and never forgets something after being told.\nHis deep crimson CENTINEL-Suit boasts balance in all levels of performance, demonstrating diverse aptitude in any mission. The Vulcan Knuckles equipped to both his arms are capable of intense blows and machine-like accuracy, which can be even further increased in power via the \"Unite Hand\" Unite Morph technique.\n\nA Wonderful One whose cover occupation is as a detective for the Los Angeles Police Department. Though young, he has gained experience and success in a variety of missions: taking down warring mafia families, counter-terrorism, and even taking part in military operations.\nHaving a strong sense of identity, and a stronger dislike for authority, Blue is not the easiest Wonderful One to deal with in the organization; however, his ability to act quickly and make decisions in the blink of an eye has led to a chain of successful missions. Yet, despite these successes, his hot-headed personality has makes Blue prone lose himself in anger, peppering his record with a significant number of failures.\nBlue insists on making a scene for everyone to see, so in combat he acts arrogant, taunting the enemy, and is prone to posturing into different poses that might look \"cool.\" Unfortunately, reactions to his antics are conspicuous in their absence.\nPoor at teamwork and preferring to work alone, Blue does not actively try seek meaningful relationships with others. Instead, he accepts only those who are able to prove their skills, but this acceptance leads to a deep respect.\nHis weapon, the Valiantium Blade, is said to become sharper with every slice, forged with a special alloy able to cut through anything in the galaxy. His Unite Sword can deal lethal blows to even battleships.\nChose to be a Wonderful One due to his incredible skill with firearms and other ranged weapons, Wonder-Green is currently a mere middle school student. Yet, despite his youth, it is said that he can shoot through the hole of a donut a 100 kilometers away, while eating a donut himself.\nPossibly due to his privileged upbringing, he often seems to feel like the world revolves around him and is prone to ignoring the reality of his surroundings. He also unwittingly rude, leading to occasional clashes with Blue and Pink; clashes Green himself seems unbothered by. In fact, at least with Pink, he almost seems to enjoy being scolded.\nEven during the tensest of missions, he possesses a completely carefree nature; that is until something goes south, then he instantly breaks into panic. Far clumsier than most would ever suspect for a Wonderful One, the world prays that the care with which Green uses his rapid-fire proton gun Christine Daa\u00e9 is another, more careful, side of him that holds great pride in his position. (Or so the world hopes...)\nHe has developed a close friendship with Black, as both are similar in age and love video games, comics, cartoons, and general mischief-making. This mischief-making extends to his love of junk food, a forbidden fruit under his parents, but a near constant indulgence as Green partakes in missions far beyond their strict reach.\n\nChosen to go to the Olympics in gymnastics while still in high school, Wonder-Pink is by far the most flexible and agile of any Wonderful One. She matches this with an advanced proficiency in melee weaponry, specifically with her Beautiful Whip, knit from a next-gen stay-press alloy \"Belmont alloy,\" for which she is unrivaled.\nPink is known for her \"laissez-faire\" personality, behaving carefree and sunny during even the most severe missions, as if her duties were just another after school club; however, it is that relaxed attitude that, more often than not, spells disaster for the team. Exceedingly sensitive towards trends, she has decorated her issued weapon with a variety of accessories, and her tendency to prioritize fashion over the mission can occasionally give her superiors headaches. Nevertheless, Pink's excellent physical aptitude and peerless acrobatics have led the team to countless victories.\nExtremely emotional, she sometimes reveals her terrifying true colors when angered. Pink is especially sensitive to anything said by Green, and she will gladly turn her tormentor into her whipping boy when set off.\nPlus many many more heroes!\nIn The Wonderful 101: Remastered, you don\u2019t just control a single superhero. You control a whole team, united to face off against the forces of evil. As you travel around the city, you\u2019ll rescue civilians, who will then join your cause, bolstering your ranks.\nThe Wonderful Ones have more than just numbers on their side. To solve puzzles and smash evil, the Wonderful Ones can perform a \u201cUnite Morph\u201d, combining together to create fists, swords, bridges and other incredible constructs.\nTogether with Wonder Red, Wonder Blue, and the rest of the Wonderful Ones, it\u2019s time to save Blossom City, and the rest of the world!\nThe most powerful tool for the Wonderful Ones is the incredible Unite Morph. By combining together, the Wonderful Ones can turn into a variety of awesome shapes, from whips to swords to giant fists.\nIn-game, players draw specific shapes on the battlefield with the control stick, and the Unite Morph initiates!\nUnite Morphing isn\u2019t just for combat, though! The Wonderful Ones can use their powers for traversal as well, whether it\u2019s a faraway ladder or a precarious rope bridge, there\u2019s nowhere The Wonderful 100 can\u2019t reach!\nUnite Hand\nPLAY\n\nThe famous fist of justice used by Wonder Red, Unite Hand is the Wonderful Ones\u2019 most basic Unite Morph. Used to pummel, smash and brutalize foes, the Unite Hand can also be used to rotate cogs and empty gacha monsters of their contents.\nUnite Sword\nPLAY\n\nWhile not as strong as the Unite Hand, the Unite Sword has a longer reach, and is sharp enough to cut through chains. As an added bonus, the Unite Sword\u2019s pristine broad side can also reflect lasers back at enemies.\nUnite Gun\nPLAY\n\nWhile the Unite Gun isn\u2019t one of the strongest Unite Morphs in the Wonderful Ones' arsenal, it really shines in long distance situations. The gun can hit both enemies and environmental objects, allowing the Wonderful Ones to defeat distant foes or solve otherwise inaccessible puzzles. \nUnite Whip\nPLAY\n\nThe Unite Whip is a Unite Morph created from combining with a flexible, thorned whip. Not only can it attack enemies from afar, it can also tie them up, making it perfect for dealing with armored foes, spiked walls, and other prickly surfaces. It can also be used to latch onto certain surfaces to swing the whole team over gaps.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhile there are always risks during the development and porting process, we are

This price is that Kevin has been commissioned to produce figures as described by others, as opposed to being totally creative in terms of originality. \nGoblinmaster Limited has been created to be dedicated to return Kevin\u2019s creative modelling to the original ethos of high-quality products that have humorous and quirky elements, that are true to the fantasy gaming community. Kevin is a major shareholder of the new business and may eventually become Kevin\u2019s sole vehicle for conceptualising, designing and delivering his artwork. Keep an eye out for the Goblinmaster copyright as this will now become Kevin\u2019s unadulterated brand, where quality and originality can be safeguarded.\nOver the coming year the wish is to produce 16 ranges/sets of products (most directly from the Goblinmaster website), all with the original, and somewhat \u2018old school\u2019 style; the very first model pack will be the Treadmill of Hubris, where Kevin has used his own ideas to produce a set-piece wagon, artifacts, characters, and narrative.  To achieve this we need initial support, both in terms of kick-start funding, plus a guide as to what ideas work and what doesn't.\nThis \u2018kick-start\u2019 is to bring Kevin\u2019s imaginary world once again alive, and to launch his unique artwork for the fantasy world.  Kevin would like to set up a fully-fledged website (goblinmaster.online)  where his work can be seen and purchased without the need for 'kick-starts'.  He can then merrily take requests from supporters as to product lines and ideas, or he can work on his pet-projects and the beloved Goblin families and the situations they find themselves in, that have made his life such fun!\n Please note that the current range are created from scratch; no characters have been adapted from existing models (and no goblins were harmed in the process).\nTreadmill of Hubris\nAs we all know, Dwarfs love their ale; and in this, they have a weakness, and often come a cropper.  The treadmill of hubris is a true demonstration of this.\nThe backdrop is that the goblins (in this case, Boglets, a small variant of goblin, that takes delight in trickery, cunning, and humiliation of their foe), having discovered a couple of Dwarfs drunk next to their barrel of ale, captures and enslaves them.  It is normal for Boglets to use the Dwarfs own barrel of beer as the cornerstone of their enslavement, and they do this with great mirth and delight in what the Boglets have coined, the Treadmill of Hubris.\nIt is a simple story; upon capture, the Dwarfs plead for their live, and seemingly being magnanimous the Boglets agree on the basis that they will commit to being slaves until their barrel of ale has become exhausted and the Dwarfs have fully sobered up.  The Boglets then use the barrel as the treadmill and lash the Dwarfs to a control bar to support them as they \u2018tread\u2019.\nUnbeknownst to the Dwarfs, the Boglets urinate in the barrel to keep it topped up (apparently 5 Boglets can produce sufficient urine so as to perpetually feed the Dwarfs \u2013 there is some science behind this, but that is another story). The Boglets add some strange fungi to the brew and produce a slightly hallucinogenic and intoxicating liquid that fool the Dwarfs into believing it is their ale.\nThe Boglets have no intention of ever letting their foe go\u2026.. Over the following weeks and sometimes months, the Boglets pimp-up their Treadmill wagon, and in this case it has a grinder and smasher; the team of Boglets are using snappers to encourage the Dwarfs when moving at \u2018battle-speed\u2019, and some other Boglets use a dung-barrel to dump onto their foe in battle.\nWe don\u2019t know what happens to the Dwarfs, they usually only last a couple of months; the Boglets either capture a new brace of Dwarfs, or dump the wagon.  Given the stature of the Dwarfs in this image, they are clearly new to the treadmill, cursing each other for not pulling their weight and for snoozing whilst drinking ale, thus causing their capture.  The Hubris bit is so the Boglets can have another laugh at the expense of the Dwarfs \u2026 Dutch courage an\u2019 all.  Dwarfs are way-too-proud and over-confident to be left without a Boglet ribbing.\nTreadmill Casting\nTreadmill Front\nTreadmill Back\nTreadmill Side\nCloser view of the Boglet crew (only 6 pieces shown)\nThe Treadmill of Hubris Boglet Crew is available to be pledged separately, however it is specifically designed to be used with the war wagon, and therefore does not have a base-insert. \n(Boglets have thin pegs so that there is freedom to drill holes anywhere in the base or roof thus allowing kustomisation of individual waggons and you could add that and soon we will have more Boglets that can be added or used as replacements for the Krew allowing for further individual kustomisation)\nPAINTED PICTURES COMING SOON!\nBaleful Boglet Bounders\nBoglets usually group in squads of between 6 and 10 beings; lead by a peer who has the greatest reputation for combining spite and irony.  The ability to think up and create new demeaning treatment of their friends and foe alike determines the success of each squad. Boglets if anything, are adaptive and experimental, using whatever is at hand to be their weapon of choice.\nIn this set, they use a variety of 'tools' to exercise their malice and malevolence, some designed to incapacitate their foe, others designed to purely humiliate.  Boglets, their height usually no more than an adult man's leg, will use attacks that are either high-level, or play to their strengths at lower levels; snappers with Boglet lancers are part of the 'and' world, the lance targets the enemy's upper-torso, and the snapper targets the lower;  one bight can easily sever a leg from a man, however they are often trained to attack softer regions.  Snappers have powerful legs, and can be trained to jump, sometimes Boglets have been known to use them a bit like bouncing-sticks and bouncing balls, riding them with glee.\nWord is that some Boglet Baddasses are being created later this year;  these are irksome creatures who care very little for any form of public decency and honour.  They are the most-ignoblest of life-forms, with their sole aim to humiliate others, and to be repulsive.  Kevin will rue the day these beggars were spawned on his workbench ....\nAll 8 Bounders\nWily Waggeries\nA little known fact of wizards is that their pointed hats are very precious to them; besides their quarterstaff, a wizard's hat is considered what defines the person who wears it.  And boy, don\u2019t the goblins all know this !!!  As part of inciting and goading wizards, Boglets will try, often to their demise, to target the wizards hat in an attack.  If they ever get hold of it, they will often urinate in the bearded-ones favourite clothing.  Wizards are not as liberal as one may believe, and will become incensed by this act and will often go berserk, killing the Boglets in an instance.  However the Boglets don\u2019t really care, the humour and insult are well worth the consequence; their names often become legendary and part of Boglet folklore.\nDon't get me started on what Boglets would do to a Wizard's Spell Book ...!!!\nAs for the wizard who has the misfortune of losing their hat, their peers sometime offer great support in dealing with the emotional upset, but their reputation can be irreparably tarnished. \nPesky Boglets!\nNEWSFLASH ....... NEWSFLASH .....  Kev has just given an update on the Wily Waggeries ....\nThe Boglets have majorly overlooked an important tool of the Wizard..... the Wizard Bertram Baptiste Bap has a very powerful wand tucked away up his sleeve. The wizard, partly out of anger, and partly out of exasperation, launches a spell using the wand ..... a spell incorrectly spoken as the spell book had been defiled, with a broken and emotional voice.  BANG !!!  The incantations were to direct the wand to turn these pesky goblins into fungus.  But no.  What was actually uttered by Baptiste turned these Boglets into a new and terrifying breed of goblin.  May the Great Goblin God forgive us ... for Baptiste has sinned ....\nFor those folk who pledged the \u00a3135 or more will be getting *** FREE OF CHARGE *** one of these new lines of Goblin as part of the package\nLook out for these new creatures on the website after this Kickstarter !!!!\nThe Oddgoblin\nThis new model is 20mm tall, so fits in with the existing scale of the Boglets.  Wizards can be good creatures, but sometimes they can be foolish - these creatures will come to haunt and plague the other beings in the world .... what have you done, Baptiste !!!?\n\nThe Goblinmaster (limited edition)\nKevin designed a 'punk' goblin many years ago - purely for personal consumption, never manufactured or displayed anywhere other than amongst family.  As part of this kickstart release, Goblinmaster will create a limited edition EXCLUSIVELY for those who support this funding initiative (for example, if 200 people request a copy on KIckstarter, then only 200 will be produced).\nBut beware, The Goblinmaster is the Manneken Pis of the Goblin World !!\nWill be available for pledges at \u00a310 if the stretch goal is met!\nThe old punk goblin (Kev will make a new one)\nThe new Goblin Master\n\nWhat else is included?\n- Custom Packaging\n- Guarantees for damaged goods\n- Directly supporting the artist!\n\n DISCLAIMER : ALL MODELS WILL BE SOLD AS CAST METAL (zero lead)\nNOTE:   POSTAL / DELIVERY CHARGES ARE NOT INCLUDED, WE WILL CONTACT YOU WITH COSTS DEPENDING ON THE WEIGHT OF YOUR ORDER AND WHAT COUNTRY YOU ARE IN.\n                BASES NOT INCLUDED\n\u00a38000   - At least one limited edition character made available (maximum production run of the number who pledge as part of this initiative )\n\u00a310,000   - Launch Boglet Baddasses,  Hoboglets, and Space Orc sets by August 2020\n\u00a315,000   - A further 8 sets launched by December 2020\nAll Future Work will be Sold on : GoblinMaster.Online ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAt this point in the development cycle, the key risks are that we are trying to use recyclable materials, low- or zero-lead metals, and other environmentally friendly approaches.

This time however we have decided to change direction in the theme of the model itself and we will be creating a Privateer character; Gabrielle Kalothetos, the captain of a powerful interstellar ship exploring the fringes of Imperial space.\nLike our 2019 model, Gabrielle will come in two poses, a standard release pose which will be available for general sale and an exclusive event variant which is intended to be used by Event Organisers as prize support or event swag. This is to try and maintain some exclusivity for the Event models but still give people an opportunity to buy a variant of the model if they don't think they will attend an event which will have it available. The model itself was designed by Nuclear Shrimp Studios and the artwork of Gabrielle was done by Simartian, Siman Vlaisavljevi\u0107 (https://www.artstation.com/simartian).\nPrivateer Gabrielle Kalothetos\nSomething new which we are introducing with this project is the inclusion of the exclusive Pledge Coins. In the past whenever planning our project we have always tried to find something to show our appreciation to the backers and thank them for supporting the projects at this stage, during the Kickstarter. This is something we hope will fill that niche for both this project and future ones. The Pledge Coins themselves are 40mm metal coins with the AUS30K logo on one side and a unique design on the reverse face representing the project they are linked to. Each backer who supports the project with a pledge that has a physical reward will receive a coin with their pledge when it arrives. The design for this project is the iconic Corinthian helm which Gabrielle own helmet is modeled off.\nThe Pledge Coin for the Privateer Gabriel Kalothetos 2020 Event Model Kickstarter\nLike the previous event model project we have already completed the 3D design of the model itself and will be starting to create the masters for the mold making process. It is hopeful that we will get images of both the masters before the project completes to give you, the backer an opportunity to see a physical model, not just a render.\nPLAY\n\nGeneral Sale version above\nPLAY\n\nEvent Exclusive version above\nINDIVIDUAL PLEDGES\nThe current range of models available to the Individual pledges are shown below and include;\nPrivateer Gabrielle Kalothetos (2020 Event model, general sale only)\nKnight House Engineer (2019 Event model, general sale only)\nKnight House Envoy (2018 Event model)\nMaggot Men (all three variants available, each counts as one model)\nNow unlocked and only available at this price as part of the Kickstarter!\nPuppet Master \nPuppet Master Portal - Human Male \nPuppet Master Portal - Human Female\nPuppet Master Portal - Marine\nAny combination of these models may be selected in your pledge, but only pledges which contain a Privateer will qualify for a Pledge Coin.\nPuppet Master (Unlocked via Stretch Goals)\nPuppet Master Portal - Human Male WIP (Unlocked via Stretch Goals)\n\n\nEVENT SUPPORT PLEDGES\nEvent Support pledges have access to all of the above models in addition to the Event Exclusive variant of the Privateer model, at least half of the models in an Event Support Pledge must be the Privateer. Only a single Pledge Coin is supplied.\nThe event exclusive version, only available through the Event Pledge\nADD ONS\nTo accompany this model all backer can also access products from our previous Unarmoured Marine project to add onto their pledges. \nUnarmoured Marines\nThese were the second models we produced and funded through Kickstarter in late 2017. They comprise of 5 uniquely posed models without powered armour, intended to represent prisoners of war stripped of their protection. They come in two sizes, regular and extra large, the latter is in line with the Primaris sized models.\n            Individuals can add a set of these to their pledge for $44 for the regular size or $49 for the extra large (normally $49/$54 respectively).\n            Event Organisers can add individual models (a minimum of ten) to their pledges for $7.50 each or $8 each for the extra large size. These pledges will contain an even (as much as possible) distribution of the five different poses.\nSTRETCH GOALS\nIn the event that the project funds over and above the goal we have some Stretch Goals planned;\nUNLOCKED - Unit Reference Card\nEach Privateer model (Individual and Event pledges), will be accompanied by a unit reference card containing the Gabrielle's custom rules and statistics.\nUNLOCKED $2,000 - Floating Puppet Master Model\nThis model will be made available as an add ons for all pledges and will also include a unit reference card. For the Kickstarter only this model, if unlocked, will be the same price as a regular infantry model!! $15 (or $13 if you are an early bird) to add or simply counts as a single model in a multi model pledge!\nUNLOCKED $3,000 - Puppet Master Portal (Human Male) Model \nUNLOCKED $3,500 - Puppet Master Portal (Human Female) Model \nUNLOCKED $4,000 - Puppet Master Portal (Marine) Model \nAll three of these models will be made available as an add ons for all pledges and will also include a unit reference card.

More details on that will be provided closer to the date of the event.\nPostage\nLike many projects before us we have been stung by the price rises of international postage. Because of this we have had to move the shipping cost component to the pledge manager stage shortly before fulfillment. Currently the costs post to international destinations are listed below, with luck this will not change between now and the fulfillment stage. These prices are based on bulk mail out orders, if individuals need their pledge sent separately, the cost may be higher then what is listed here.\n\n            New Zealand \n            Up to 500g: $15  (around two dozen models)\nNorth America, Western Europe, Asia and the Pacific\n            Up to 250g: $15  (around a dozen models)\n            Up to 500g: $20  (around two dozen models)\nRest of the world\n            Up to 250g: $15 (around a dozen models)\n            Up to 500g: $25 (around two dozen models)\n\n            *: unless requested, we will attempt to pack as many models into blisters as possible. If you request a 1:1 ratio of model per blister, this may result in a higher shipping cost.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis will be our fifth project creating a model along with the trials and tribulations of production and distribution. We have worked closely with both 3rd parties involved in this particular project and are confident that we have ironed out any teething problems from the previous experiences.\nThe model itself has been fully designed already and as the project goes live the master has been printed and is in preparation for the mold creation. This will significantly speed up the production time, although it did require a lot more up front investment.\nThe major hiccup which we encountered on the last Kickstarter project was the international distribution. This came about from relying on a courier who had assured us that they would have rolled out international pickup to our location in time for our fulfillment. This did not happen and so were forced to instead ship the individual parcels in a single bulk lot to a secondary pickup location from where they were then dispatched. This caused some delays in the 2nd and 3rd wave for international backers.\nWe have taken steps to prevent this from occurring again with alternative courier contracts and other methods for distribution.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge AU$ 15 or more", "title": "Individual Model", "descp": "This pledge is for a single Privateer model, cast in resin and the exclusive pledge coin.

This secretive audio visual group is comprised of 4 individuals (1 visual artist and 3 musicians). But to the general public they are known as the virtual characters that represent them: femme boss and front woman Cherry, keytarist Goldie Foxx and DJ Dyna Mink.\nJoin us on this adventure by following us on: YOUTUBE, INSTAGRAM, FACEBOOK, TUMBLR!\nNot attached to any major label or conglomerate to date, Studio Killers is made through the hard work and dedication of the 4 people behind the band. The crew all have side gigs to make ends meet. The main visual artist creates the majority of all the visual work by herself, scaling up with a small crew for music videos and bigger events like this Kickstarter! Studio Killers has been a passion project fuelled by love, family, friends and fans.\nThis animated Studio Killers 404 pilot/special will be a parody on the classic magical girl trope. Kind of a crossbreed between Sailor Moon and Rick and Morty. It will feature a brand new song and a full soundtrack!\nIntroducing new characters for you to love!\nThrown into cyberspace and left fending for their very existence, Cherry and the Studio Killers are building an army of LGBTQ+ positive, misfits and outliers, on a quest to overthrow the Evil Algorithm, a deep state like organization that is destroying the internet and erasing all it\u2019s weird wonders. Style battles, a war between cats and porn, a whole planet dedicated to taco memes - there's so much to explore and save! Cherry\u2019s using her unique power of style to bring the \u2018love\u2019 back! \nCherry and the Studio Killers' big dream is to create an animated series to push this project to the next level and to deliver the kind of amazing jaw dropping content they\u2019re known for, but with much healthier business structure! Getting an animated series signed with a Network or VOD would drive all our other content, ensuring the project's future! There has been a lot of interest from partners and networks, but ultimately development, pitching, and negotiations often take several years with the additional added 1.5-3 years of production before the fans get to see anything at all, if ever. We\u2019d really prefer not to keep you in the dark THAT long.\nWith this Kickstarter we can share with you the process and the journey of creating an amazing animated special that doubles as a pilot for the series! With you the backers getting to see it as soon as it\u2019s done regardless of future deals in the making. While at the same time being able to create some amazing rewards for you to get your hands on! \nVisually stunning animated mayhem!\nYou can help by backing this campaign which you will be rewarded for with amazing swag! If you can't back this Kickstarter for whatever reason, you can still help by sharing this project with friends and family far and wide. Share it with anyone you think would love seeing a crazy action comedy magical girl concept with stunning art and great music! \nThe Writers for the Pilot\nFor the special Cherry will be working with Alison Norrington of storycentral.com, a storyteller who has worked across theme parks, film, television, crowdfunding and gaming. She will make sure that the Studio Killers 404 special and series concept is as uncompromising and fearless as Cherry herself.\nThe Writers for the series\nFor the series we\u2019re putting together a kick-ass team of diverse and inclusive talent handpicked throughout the industry to represent all the values that Studio Killers is founded on while being the kind of funny crazy super nerds with the experience of pulling off a hit series. We aim to walk the walk.\nThe Animation\nCherry (the visual artist) has a long history of running and building productions. With her knowledge, skills and contacts she has the tools to build an ace team to produce the special. We believe in creator driven properties and that is what this will be, with the reigns securely in the hands of the creator herself. We have many ties to production companies and talent, so we're ready to scale as needed!\nMajority of the money will be used for animation production. In fact our current goal is quite tight! So we plan to put in lots of our own resources and time to make this happen. Which is how we Studio Killers get things done.\n\nNEW STRETCH GOAL 220,000\u00a3!!! \nAMAZING! THIS IS GONNA BE HUGE! We reached our goal in under 48 hours!!! Our new goal is to double the fun! By doubling the length of the pilot from our planned 11 minutes to a robust 22 minutes!

Once we get into the series, episodes take less time to produce.\n\nDelivery of most rewards is set for august 2020. In the case of signed items, the reward delivery is set for December 2020. We need this time to make sure all the products meet our standards of quality and to create the pilot which is part of every reward tier! \n\nEven if we make and deliver the pilot, there is no guarantee that we will land a deal for an animated series.

Should for some reason, luck not be in our favor, we will let everyone know what our next steps will be.\n\nWhatever happens you will definitely see what we ever have made with the money, even if that should be an unfinished pilot!\n\nThank you for your support and understanding!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a310 or

We love tabletop games. We love anthropomorphic animals, from Disney's Robin Hood through The Wind in the Willows to Brian Jaques' Redwall books. So we combined the things we love in our Burrows & Badgers tabletop skirmish game and the accompanying range of miniatures. And our Kickstarter backers have already helped us to grow the range to over 100 miniatures - but now it's time to add some more!\nSome miniatures from previous projects...\n\nWhy are we making more miniatures?\nBecause we want more characters for our Burrows & Badgers games \u2013 my Freebeast warband needs reinforcements, for a start! \nAnd we know a lot of other people are looking for more anthropomorphic animal miniatures too. A lot of people are playing Burrows & Badgers now, and many of them have asked for Massive Hounds and a Massive Raptor, so we've sculpted them! Some will want to use them for other tabletop or roleplaying games, while others love painting miniatures, and our figures are perfect for that, full of character ready to be brought to life with your paintbrush....\nAnd some people just love collecting miniatures; again, we've made this new set of Burrows & Badgers figures perfect for collectors. They are all single piece models, with integral bases, so there are no fiddly parts to be glued on.\nWe love making miniatures; we hope you'll love our miniatures too.\nWhy we need your help...\nWe've got 17 new miniatures sculpted, but they need to have moulds made before we can start producing the miniatures. And that's why we need funding; to get the production moulds made, and get the casting process started.\nAbout the miniatures...\nThere are other ranges of anthropomorphic animal miniatures out there, but ours are a little different. We didn't want all the races of animals to be the same size. Instead, we've scaled them to each other; so a shrew or a mouse is a very small model, about 20mm tall, and a really big animal like a badger will stand about 50mm tall, for example.\nEach sculpted figure shown below has a scale picture with it, showing its height in millimetres. All our models are supplied unpainted.\n\nIf you'd like to learn more about the Burrows & Badgers range and the game, here's a link to the Burrows & Badgers website and to the Facebook Group (which is the friendliest Group on FB, I reckon!):\n\nThe Pledges\nWe\u2019re keeping it as simple as possible; there\u2019s an \u2018All-in\u2019 pledge, which gets you all the new miniatures in this Kickstarter, and any bonus bits that may come along\u2026 there\u2019s also a \u2018Pick\u2019n\u2019Mix\u2019 Pledge, if you just want to get a few of the new miniatures.

It's a brand new version of Say What You See, the the greatest Catchphrase-style rebus puzzle game ever (Don't just take our word for it - Harry Potter star Tom Felton loves it too!).\n- Tom Felton (Draco Malfoy, The Harry Potter Series)\nWe've got some amazing offers for you during this Kickstarter too, including:\n Great deals on Puzzle Pass annual subscriptions (which give you access to over 50 canvases at launch, at least 25 more in the first year, and tons of other benefits)\n Signed copies of the new Jim'll Paint It Book 'Of Mouse and Man' \n Jim'll Paint It signed Say What You See canvas prints \nThe chance to appear in a future SWYS painting done by Jim'll Paint It \n And lots more! \nA sample puzzle from our game - it's \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows\"!\nLaunched by Big Ideas Digital almost 10 years ago, 'Say What You See: The Collection' was a mobile puzzle app like no other. Based on a concept by Big Ideas Digital owner David Stevens, it presented players with large themed canvas paintings, each with 50 rebus picture puzzles hidden inside for players to find and solve. It\u2018s also known as SWYS*.\nIf you've ever seen the TV show Catchphrase, or seen the puzzles under the bottle caps of Lone Star beers, you'll know how a rebus puzzle works - just look at the puzzle and Say What You See!\nHere's a small sample of the US TV Shows canvas to give you the idea:   \nThose puzzles explained: Buffy The Vampire Slayer - It's a buff 'E' slaying a Vampire! Charlie's Angels - It's Charlie Chaplin surrounded by angels! Knight Rider - He's riding a knight!\nYou can click here to play trial versions of some of the canvases at our website - give it a go, and you'll quickly see how much fun it is! \nAn instant success on launch in 2010, Say What You See: The Collection was a #1 app, and had over 2.5m downloads. It was also among the top 30 most popular apps of 2011. Over the next four years, Say What You See released over 50 canvases, and several spin-off apps, including a popular official tie-in version with the BBC to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Doctor Who. Click here to try it! We did an interview about it with Pocket Gamer, which you can read here. The Doctor Who canvases will be available in this new app too!\n- The Doctor Who version featured over 150 Doctor Who-inspired puzzles!\nSadly, all good things eventually come to an end, and in 2014 the app was discontinued when its parent company was sold on.\nBut the story doesn't have to end there. Cybernet Apps (a new company made up of ex-Big Ideas Digital staff) have licensed the game's IP, and are all ready to create a brand new Say What You See app - \"Say What You See: Ultimate Edition\".\nWe just need your help to make it happen.   \nWe want \"Say What You See: Ultimate Edition\" to be just that. It will contain the 50 original canvases produced for the various Say What You See apps, as well as new canvases every month. \nWe're bringing back all the classic Say What You See artists like Army of Trolls (Arcade Classics, Console Classics), Ryan Firchau (Fantasy Movies, Doctor Who) and Martin Davey (Christmas Movies, Grace's Toons). We're also very excited to announce our Exclusive Backer's Canvas artist...\nYes, our Exclusive Backer's Canvas will be created by internet sensation Jim'll Paint It! All Reward tiers from \u00a35 and up include Jim's Exclusive Backer's Canvas in the game. \n\"Ask me to paint anything you wish and I will try no matter how specific or surreal your demands. You name it. I\u2019ll paint it. On Paint.\u201d\nSince making this promise, back in 2013, Jim has painted some 400 requests - covering everything from Thom Yorke the Tank Engine and Dad\u2019s Army of Darkness to Mick Jagger disappointing customers at the paint mixing station in B&Q by matching every colour as black - each brought to life with painstaking detail using nothing but an archaic version of Microsoft Paint and an optical mouse. \n- Just a few of the brilliant images that have spewed from Jim's mind.\nWe're really excited to have Jim come on board to do his first Say What You See canvas, and we've got some great new backer deals that will let you get a signed copy of his brand new book 'Of Mouse and Man' (unbound Publishing, RRP \u00a325) or even a signed print of his upcoming canvas!\nAt Say What You See, we pride ourselves on finding the very best artistic talent around. Check out some of the 50 Canvases we've already produced:\nArcade Classics Canvas - by Army of Trolls\nFantasy Movies Canvas - by Ryan Firchau\nKids Cartoons - by Martin Davey\nRock Bands - By Aileen Raistrick\nHere's the full list of already produced canvases. The 50 canvases below are all completed already. All 50 will be unlocked and ready to play at launch with any subscription. On top of all these, we'll be producing new canvases every month, just as we did before.\nThe 50 original SWYS canvases.\nSay What You See is suitable for gamers of any age, gender or dexterity. Playing it is as easy as 1, 2, 3!\n1. Search for a potential puzzle, based on the canvas theme. Don't be shy to get a closer look too - use finger pinches and stretches to zoom in and out, and swipes to scroll around the image!\n2. Tap the puzzle and type in your guess... \n3. Repeat until you solve all 50 puzzles and the canvas!  \nWhile the initial app download and starter canvas is free, additional canvas downloads can either be cherry picked individually with one-off in-app purchases, or you can unlock all the current and future canvases at once by purchasing a Puzzle Pass Subscription! \nHere's how the subscriptions stack up!\nSubscribing offers the ultimate Say What You See experience. No ads, early access to canvases, free hint coins every month, and a store discount for purchasing Say What You See merch!  \nBuying a 1, 2, or 3 year Gold Puzzle Pass subscription will give you access to 50 canvases at launch, plus all additional canvases released over the duration of your sub. That's 2500 individual Say What You See puzzles at launch!\nThis Kickstarter is a great time to purchase a Gold Puzzle Pass Subscription, as we're offering massive discounts of up to 50% off if you're quick enough to grab an early bird package. \nAnd if you're already a big SWYS fan, you can even purchase a lifetime Platinum Puzzle Pass Subscription which will last for the entire length of the app's life. You'll never have to buy another canvas again! Plus you'll get access to Demo builds as we develop the app, meaning you'll be playing Say What You See again before anyone else!\nPlus, in addition to all the Gold Puzzle Pass benefits, you'll get EXTRA bonus canvases that are only available to Platinum Pass Subscribers! It gets better too - we're offering a whopping 60% off for this Kickstarter only - that's better than half price!\nThese discount rates will never be available again, so there really is no better time to subscribe.   \nWe do appreciate that some people simply don't like subscriptions, so there's also the Gold Digger tier, where you can purchase 25 canvas unlocks of your choice upon the app's release. \nApp Will Be Available On Android and Apple Devices\nSay What You See: Ultimate Edition is currently aimed at most mobile and tablet devices - but we're not ruling other platforms in the future! Currently we're targeting:\niPhone and iPad (iOS 12.0+)\nAndroid phones and Android tablets (Android OS 8.0+)\nWe're aware that a lot of SWYS fans purchased canvases on the original app, and while we don't have access to the old App Store and Google Play accounts, and can't restore purchases, we don't want our oldest fans to feel ignored. So for this Kickstarter period, we'll be running the Canvas Exchange Program. \nIf you back our Kickstarter at the Early Bird Gold Puzzle Pass tier or above, you'll have the option to exchange all your old paid canvases* for the equivalent amount of canvas unlocks in the new app. You can either spend them on the same canvases, or brand new ones! These canvases will be yours to keep whether or not you stay subscribed to the app. \n*NB. Proof of purchase, which can be found in your Google/iTunes accounts will be required.  We will show you how to find and send this information to us once the Kickstarter has completed. \nIf you check out the rewards section, you'll see we've got some amazing backer rewards available, including:\nA once in a lifetime chance to own a beautiful gallery-quality giclee print of Jim'll Paint It's Backer's Canvas\nSigned copies of Jim's brand new book \"Of Mouse and Man\"\n- Signed copies of Jim's brand new book 'Of Mouse and Man' are available in the rewards!\nThe chance to have your face painted into the canvas by Jim, preserved in the app for all time! And hey, if you're not a fan of putting yourself in the picture, think what an amazing birthday, wedding or anniversary gift it would make for a loved one!\nAnd of course, almost all backers* will get access to the Jim'll Paint It exclusive backer's canvas, as a thank you for your support.\n\nNeed a handy guide to see which rewards you get at each tier? We've got you covered, with this handy matrix diagram that we spent many hours making. \n*\u00a31 tier excepted. \nRewards Matrix\nSo the Say What You See project is awesome, right? Well what if we told you we could make it even more awesome by telling other people about it? \nAs you tick off backer achievements by helping us spread the word about this Kickstarter campaign on social media, you'll unlock some awesome backer rewards! \nThese rewards will change the Kickstarter for everyone, from unlocking  free hint coins to getting awesome physical rewards. Get all 36 achievements and you\u2019ll earn a new free canvas for every single backer! We'll be revealing more achievements as each target is hit. \nThe links for the content you need to promote can be found below the picture. \nBacker achievements and rewards\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/swysapp \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/SWYSApp \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/swys_puzzle_app \nDavid Stevens - SWYS Creator\nDavid Stevens is the owner of Big Ideas Digital, and the creator of the Say What You See franchise. \nFormally VP at 20th Century Fox, David has built and run several companies in the technology and media space. He also makes a pretty mean cup of tea.  \nJon Hamblin - SWYS Designer, puzzle writer and pun-master.\nJon Hamblin was the designer of Say What You See: The Collection, and also the author of most of the original canvas puzzles. He also ran the social media channels, customer support and tea making for Big Ideas Digital. \nSince then, he's gone on to produce several award-winning games, and most recently worked on Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout for Devolver Digital and Mediatonic.\nHe'll be running this Kickstarter campaign, designing Say What You See: Ultimate Edition, writing all the puzzles and probably doing all the washing up. Again. \nCarleton Handley - Programmer extraordinaire\nCarleton Handley has been programming since the 8-bit era, notoriously coding the original Spitting Image game for Domark on the Commodore 64. \nCarleton was the programmer on Say What You See: The Collection, and he's keen to get started on bringing this classic series back to life. \nIf you're good enough to back this project, it's only fair to tell you how we're going to spend the money. \nWe've asked for the absolute bare minimum to make this project, and it breaks down into three sections - app development, UI (Essentially the menus, animations and whizzy graphics) and content, which is the canvases themselves. \nBudget Breakdown: App Development - 50%, UI/UX - 30%, Content, 20%\nIf we are lucky enough to get more than our goal, we'll be spending the extra money on more content for the app and marketing. So the more you fund the app, the more canvases and content you'll get! \nFinally, you might wonder why we're bringing this project to Kickstarter. \nIt's pretty simple really. Ever since we made the original Say What You See app, we've been passionate fans ourselves. It was heartbreaking for us when the app's first run ended, and behind the scenes we've been working tirelessly ever since to bring it back.\nNow the planets have aligned, and we have the Say What You See license back, we're keen to start making it as soon as possible - so rather than spending months looking for independent funding, we decided to Kickstart the development by bringing it to the SWYS fans first. \nOne of the biggest reasons the app died originally is that Say What You See is not a cheap game to make. We pride ourselves on only using the best artists from around the world and keeping the quality bar extremely high. The money raised by this Kickstarter will go towards new canvases, development costs and a fresh new look for the app. We're only asking for the barest minimum to make the project, and any extra money we make will go on more content. \nThat's why we're asking you, the fans, to help. Simply put, if the Kickstarter doesn't work, the app just won't get made. \nGiven how much joy this app has brought to people over the years, we think that'd be a shame. So let's all work together to bring Say What You See  back - and hopefully add a few extra smiles to the world in the process. \nSay What You See has had lots of press - here's where you might have seen us!\n*Oh and finally, sorry to any confused rugby fans who\u2018ve been directed here by Google - it stands for Say What You See and not Swys de Bruin, the Isuzu Southern Kings rugby coach \ud83d\ude09", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe're a small team, and sometimes there are unforeseen bumps in the road. Games get delayed sometimes, and it would be impossible for us to promise you this one won't be.\n\nThat said, we've made Say What You See in several flavours before, and we're confident that we've set a timetable and budget that we can stick to. We've spent months trying to get this one right because we believe in the game (and really, really want to play it again!) We\u2019re certain the game will be made, and that you\u2019ll get all the rewards you\u2019ve backed for.\n\nIt's important to note that this is not some corporation buying an old license and trying to wring some cash out of it - this is a passion project from the people who started Say What You See. We're hoping that there\u2019s enough fans out there to help bring this app back through crowdfunding. \n\nWe want to create the Ultimate Edition of Say What You See, and with your help, we think we can do it.\n\nWe know Say What You See is special to many of you - It\u2019s certainly very special to us. Let\u2019s all work together to bring this app back, and this time, keep it around for good.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Jon Hamblin\nFirst created \u00b7 7 backed\nProducer of several BAFTA-nominated games, Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout and designer of Say What You See, the popular mobile game.See more"}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a31 or more", "title": "The New Supporter", "descp": "\u25ba Support the project, and gain our eternal thanks!\nINCLUDES:\n\ud83d\ude4f Our Eternal Thanks", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2019"}], "stat": ["2 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a35 or more", "title": "The Bet Hedger", "descp": "\u25ba Pledge \u00a35 and you'll get access to our exclusive backers canvas!\nThe canvas will be unlocked in the app via a unique code that will be distributed to backers.\nNEW!

Pre-order your copy here.\nALL EXPANSIONS AND BOOSTERS UNLOCKED!\nRendered image. Design not final.\nRendered image. Design not final.\nRendered image. Design not final.\n NOTE: For 4 weeks after the campaign finishes, all late pledges, upgraded pledges, and add-ons in BackerKit will count toward stretch goals. Donated decks and books will be paid for with a portion of post-campaign raised through BackerKit and pre-sales, not through Kickstarter funds.\n The Story Engine is a deck of 150 cards (now upgraded to 180 with stretch goals!) that offer endless storytelling prompts for writers, teachers, artists, DMs, RPG players, and more.\nIt runs on a simple, fast, open-ended system of drawing and arranging cards to create prompts for:\nStory ideas\nCharacter concepts\nEncounter premises\nMagical items\nCampaign hooks\nIt's all in how you arrange the cards, interpret the connections between them, and bring the concept to life.\nNote: This is a rendered image and not a final design.\nThe Story Engine deck works in any setting or genre. You can use recommended patterns for generating prompts for specific writing goals, or come up with your own systems.\nI've been using it to generate ideas for my weekly postcard fiction project, The Shortest Story, and using my stories to refine the deck system and simplify mechanics. \nBecause every story I write for The Shortest Story fits on a postcard and features an entirely new premise, it's the perfect testing ground for new ideas. I've collected 90 of the best stories I wrote while developing the deck into The Story Engine anthology (now 94 with stretch goals)! \nNote: This is a rendered image and not a final design.\nIt changed my life and helped me produce my best work when I discovered a creative structure that got me over my anxieties and mental blocks about writing.\nI think there are thousands of other people out there who have stories to tell, and just need a bit of help getting the words out.\nIf that sounds familiar, this project is for you.\nThe Story Engine deck has only two core rules:\n1) Don't leave the table without creating something, even if it's only in your head.\n2) Ignore any rule or guideline that doesn't serve your creative process.\nI've consulted friends who are writers, game designers, Tarot readers and artists for their thoughts, and come up with additional guidelines and recommendations for creating powerful prompts.\nThe Story Engine deck is made up of five types of cards that each tap into an element of what makes a powerful, interesting, and unique story.\nTo create the simplest form of a prompt:\n Draw and play 1 Agent to create a character\n Draw and play 1 Engine to give them a motivation\n Draw and play 1 Anchor to focus the Engine on an object, event or location\n Draw and play 1 Obstacle to create the central conflict of the story\n Draw and tuck 1 Aspect (place it under the Agent or Anchor, your choice) to add more detail\nEvery card in the deck is multi-sided, and can be rotated to create different interpretations or thematically linked variations of the same prompt.\n As you play your cards, arrange the cards so the version of the prompt you wish to use is facing you. You can interpret cards literally (where the Agent card \"Artist\" means a person who creates art) or in an open-ended way (where \"Artist\" means anyone with creative powers, like a prolific inventor, a manic genius, or a master heist-planner). \nWhen you're done, you'll have the basic prompt for your story: a character who wants something, and an obstacle to overcome to get it. Let your imagination take it from there.\nThis could be an apocalypse survivor who finds a seemingly perfect haven community with a dark secret, and must decide whether to dig deeper.\nOr an ageing war veteran who moves into an idyllic senior's residence, only to discover that the place is so nice because it's used to launder money.\nOr an addiction survivor finds out that their online support group, previously a haven in their journey to recovery, is being used to identify vulnerable targets for identity theft. The discover the group organizers are in on it. Confronting this problem will mean being hated for dissolving the group.\nThis basic pattern takes seconds to set up and offers more than 12,000,000,000 unique prompts to get you started, but there are endless card patterns you can use to open your storytelling options.\nYou can also use face-down cards to represent pre-existing portions of a story, such as player characters, NPCs, or important items/locations.\nHere's how you create a quick random encounter with an NPC with an agenda involving a party member.\n This could be a clairvoyant fire mage who spreads a rumour about a party member as a scare tactic to keep their congregation in line as their authority crumbles due to ailing health.\nOr the fire-and-brimstone leader of an apocalypse cult, whose last failed end-of-the-world prediction didn't come true, and they're blaming it on the party.\nHere's how you generate a sentient magic item or haunted location that wants something from a player, and will imprint its will on them.\n This could be a heavenly, golden trumpet, whose previous owner was tasked with closing down the fighting pits, and failed. If a party member finds it, they'll have the ability to play divine anthems to buff the party, but will be imprinted with a quest to go shut down blood sports once and for all.\nOr, the party finds an enchanted harp that plays the music of the spheres, captivating all who hear its strings. It longs to be connected to its previous owner, a disgraced bard who now plays for coin outside an illegal gambling arena on another continent. The harp will slowly possess the player character who finds it, making them play its former owner's songs until they track the bard down and give it back.\nOr you can structure a story or campaign around two rivals who want the same thing:\n The could be the god of war, who has decided that pestilence would be a more efficient way to end humanity. Meanwhile, a demon-plagued vigilante sees the incipient outbreak as a judgment on humanity, and is searching for a way to control who the plague kills so they can wipe out those they see as guilty. The players will have to  stop them both and contain the threat.\nOr a powerful demigod blamed for an ancient cataclysm is back, once again trying to end the world with a virus that sends ordinary people into sudden homicidal fits. Their old adversary, a demon, has possessed the body of a commoner and turned them into a folk hero fighting the outbreak. The party must work with them, however begrudgingly, to learn how the demigod was stopped last time and ensure they fail once again.\nFor an adventure hook tied to a campaign concept, take the rivals spread and have the party stumble across the contested Anchor. Or replace the Anchor with an NPC who approaches the party for help.\nThey must either choose a side, or become a third faction with their own connection to the Anchor.\nThe Story Engine deck gives you endless options for creating, developing, mapping or improvising entire stories, characters, and campaigns.\nI am even developing two-player prompts for collaborative storytelling or mutual writing challenges, along with genre-focused expansion decks for fantasy, science fiction, horror, and more.\nNote for disambiguation: Story Engine is a Precis Intermedia trademark for its collaborative roleplaying game and rules (www.pigames.net). The Story Engine is a Peter Chiykowski trademark for his deck of story prompts (www.storyenginedeck.com). \nI developed The Story Engine deck because I've met so many people who have incredible ideas for stories, books, characters, games and campaigns trapped in their heads, but can't find time or motivation to create them.\nI know first-hand how frustrating that is, and how feels like you're missing out on your best creative years. \nI lost my connection with writing for a few years, and I didn't realize how much colour and depth had drained from my world until I finally picked up the pen again. I knew I might never finish a novel, so I started writing these 25-to-250-word mini-stories, often prompted by scrolling through royalty-free photography sites looking for images that sparked an interest, or jotting down words, phrases or ideas that stuck with me.\nThis eventually became The Shortest Story, my weekly postcard fiction project, which has been running since June 2017. \nIt's also seen me through some really dark times and difficult life transitions. No matter what was going on outside of my little writing nook, I was able to turn to my stories either as an escape, or as an arena to face my down my demons on my own turf. These stories are always the scariest to write, but they're the ones people seek me out to talk to me about again and again, often to tell me about their own creative projects they want to get off the ground.\nI know these stories are speaking to people, and I know people have their own things to say too, their own stories to tell.\nThe project has grown by leaps and bounds since launch and I am excited to unveil three  60-card genre expansion decks as well as a set of six 18-card subgenre boosters for The Story Engine. \nRendered image. Design not final.\nWritten in Dragonfire features 60 cards for fantasy storytelling. I've teamed up with EMBERWIND, a groundbreaking tabletop RPG with stunning visuals and a world-class art team, to bring you some truly eye-watering visuals.\nThe 60-card deck showcases a mixture of existing art from the EMBERWIND lore and illustration library, as well as several new pieces special to this project. As a writer on the EMBERWIND team, I can tell you that the artists have been a major inspiration for pushing my storytelling and worldbuilding to new heights.\nThe cards feature artists from the EMBERWIND roster past and present, including CRUSH Visual, Toma Feizo Gas, William Liu, Colin Searle, Frank Yang, Jonny Hall, baimon, and more. These artists have worked on art for blockbuster movies, AAA video game titles, and tabletop classics like Dungeons & Dragons, Pathfinder, and Magic: The Gathering.\n You can see more of their work in the EMBERWIND lore archive, which includes short stories, free EMBERWIND DLC, and lots of pretty art. You can also download and play a free demo the first act of The Songweave Tapestry, the forthcoming campaign I've been writing with the team for the past year. \nWritten in the Light of Strange Worlds features 60 science -fiction prompt cards, covering ground from tech-driven science fiction, to dystopian futurism, to space travel, to alien contact, to artificial intelligence and beyond.\n\nWritten in Ash and Bone features 60 horror-themed prompt cards covering everything from psychological thrillers, to ghost stories, to slashers, to paranormal investigation, to occult musings, to creepypasta, to classic monster stories.\nThere also booster sets of 18 cards focused on particular subgenres. Booster sets are non-randomized and contain the following breakdown of card types.\n5 Agent cards\n2 Engine cards\n5 Anchor cards\n2 Obstacle cards\n4 Aspect cards\n\nRendered image. Design not final.\nRendered image. Design not final.\n Dark Crafts & Ancient Horrors contains 18 eldritch/Lovecraftian horror-themed cards.\n Cog Hearts & Steam Souls contains 18 steampunk-themed cards and features the art of the tabletop RPG EMBERWIND.\n Circuits & Cybernetics contains 18 cyberpunk-themed cards.\n Wastelands& Wanderers contains 18 post-apocalyptic-themed cards.\n Mythwalkers & Eternals contains 18 mythology-themed cards and features the art of the tabletop RPG EMBERWIND.\n Jackboots & Chainlink contains 18 dystopian-themed cards.\nThe Story Engine: A Postcard Story Collection is a collection of 90 one-page mini-stories (now 94 with stretch goals) that read like postcards from alternate lives, parallel worlds, and broken timelines. \nNote: This is a rendered image and not a final design.\nThe theme of the collection is the idea that humans are story engines. The way we move forward, the way we survive, is by taking our environments and experiences and transforming them into stories.  It's how we take all of our heartbreaks and victories and betrayals and trysts and journeys and make sense of them, turn them into something that powers us, that we can share with others so we aren't alone with it. Stories are a survival mechanism, are the human spirit saying:\nI made it through this, and you can survive this too.\nThe stories in The Story Engine book mix genres and overturn tropes, jumping between:\na parable about demons seeking refuge in the suburbs\na heartfelt internal monologue by a ghost hunter looking back on their resume\na creepy urban legend about a dark entity you can only see with your eyes closed\nYou get to experience it all with the flip of a few pages.  \nThe collection also features 20 brand-new stories that have never appeared on the website before, as a special thank you for backers helping me bring this project to fruition.\nThere will also be 6 stories narrated by Cecil Baldwin, the voice of Welcome to Night Vale, with additional stories voiced by Jonathan Sims (The Magnus Archives) and one more mystery guest.  Below is a sample narrated story.\nYou can read or listen to more stories on shorteststory.com or:\nFacebook\nTwitter\nInstagram\nTumblr\nYouTube\nThe book will be published by ChiZine Publications, an award-winning publisher of dark fiction based in Peterborough Canada.\n The book also includes guest stories by some incredible contributors:\nSebastian A.

If you are interested in any of the older range, and want to save on shipping, there will be an option to add them to your pledge on the Pledge Manager that will be released after the campaign.\n And a huge thank you to all of the ArcWorlde fans who have helped me to get here - you are all wonderful, and I couldn't have done it without you!\nThe cost of shipping is not included in your pledge, and will be added after the conclusion of the campaign through the pledge manager. \nI will provide you all with full instructions when the time comes. I am still finalizing the exact shipping costs, but to give you a rough idea here are a couple of preliminary estimates:\nTREASURE MAP: - \u00a30 unless used to purchase miniatures in the campaign.\nEXPLORER: - \u00a32 to the UK, \u00a34 ROW. Additional shipping will be added if more miniatures are purchased in the campaign.\nADVENTURER/SWASHBUCKLER: \u00a34 to the UK, \u00a310 ROW.\nHERO: \u00a35 to the UK, \u00a312 ROW.\nThese estimates may increase if you purchase a large number of additional models on top of your core pledge. The final shipping costs are subject to change, and will be based on your location and specific rewards.\nFor those of you in the EU - as with everyone else, we have no idea what the outcome of Brexit will be on shipping costs, including any potential tariffs. We will keep you all updated as we find out more.\nSalute Pick-Up\nIf all goes to plan, I will have everything shipped before Salute 2020. If I've been able to stick to these deadlines, a free option to pick up at Salute will available in the pledge manager for those attending the show.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAny undertaking of this nature is a huge commitment and a lot of work for everyone involved. Miniatures need sculpting, manufacturing, packing and eventually shipping to the backers.\n\nIt is at these hurdles that some Kickstarters have faltered in the past, so, I have given careful consideration to each part of the process to minimise potential risk. Warploque Miniatures is a family run business, so everyone involved is 100% dedicated to making this project as successful and professional as possible. My father is our resin caster, my mother is in charge of packing and shipment, and our metal caster is a tried and tested person we have worked with for over three years.\n\nAlso, instead of relying purely on concept art and work-in-progress sculpts to illustrate my products, all of the initial models that I am offering have already been sculpted. They've been cast, the display copies have been painted, and they are ready to go into production, so backers know exactly what they are investing in. I will be relying on Work in Progress sculpts and concept art for some of the stretch goals, but be assured that they will be completed and cast in a timely manner once the campaign has been funded.\n\nFinally, I have set achievable delivery date estimates. I have kept the campaign small and manageable, eschewing an overly long list of stretch goals, so this project has a much higher probability of being completed and delivered on time.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a31 or more", "title": "(1.1) TREASURE MAP", "descp": "The start of your adventures into ArcWorlde.\nJust fancy a particular model?

In 2017 I did a series of sketches of those creatures and several of those creatures have since made it into miniature form. \nOne of those sketches, 'Juicy', was of a very wealthy trader from Gar Loren who has made his fortune selling a variety of potent juices from his patented mobile juice bars. The juice bars are Voralls; heavily armoured creatures who have had their tusks removed and large quantities of juice strapped to their backs.\nI sculpted a Vorall last year, fully intending to cover the poor creature in as much baggage as I could squeeze onto its shell. I have now had some master casts done and would like to get it into full production. I sent Joe one of the master casts and he has already worked his magic on it:\nThis is going to be another very simple campaign so I can get everything produced and out to backers as quickly as possible! I do have a few ideas for little stretch goals and potential additions during the campaign though, so I hope you give me the excuse I need to bring those to fruition!\nAt the moment there are just three pledge levels, a metal cast of Zhontain on his own, a resin cast of Zhontain with the Juice bar, or your own personal Juice Bar franchise. All models are supplied unpainted and require some assembly.\n\u00a35: The Juice Seller: Metal cast of Zhontain al Griba\n\u00a322: The Juice Bar: Resin cast of Zhontain al Griba and the Vorall Juice Bar with a laser cut wooden base, PLUS: Stat cards for Zhontain, the Juice Bar, Dravu, Chey, the well-fed PreePree and Lady Emarlai\n\u00a345: The Juice Franchise: Resin cast of Zhontain al Griba, two Vorall Juice Bars (with a laser cut wooden bases and one with a variant head and tail), an alternate sign and a little urchin. PLUS: Bonus bottles and Stat cards for Zhontain, the Juice Bar, Dravu, Chey, the well-fed PreePree and Lady Emarlai\nPostage: When you pledge, postage will automatically be added onto your pledge value, depending where in the world you are. The postage for The Juice Bar will also cover any extras you add on. The postage for the Juice Seller has been kept deliberately low, so does not cover postage if you add extras.\n\nThere are a couple of add-on options in case you need more Juice bars or would like a fancy resin base for your juice bar. If you have ordered The Juice Bar pledge level then simply increase your pledge by the necessary amount and I will ask for details after the kickstarter is over.\n\u00a32: 60mm resin base (max of one per Juice Bar ordered)\n\u00a34: Alternate Juice Bar sign and Urchin\n\u00a34: Well-fed PreePree\n\u00a34: Lady Emarlai\n\u00a34: Deck of 6 cards (Zhontain, Juice Bar, Dravu, Chey, Well-fed PreePree and Lady Emarlai)\u00a35: Additional Metal Zhontain\n\u00a38: Mercenaries (2 metal figures)\u00a320: Additional Resin Vorall Juice Bar with wooden base\n\u00a322: Additional Resin Zhontain and Juice Bar with wooden base\n\n\nFor those of you who are new to the World of Anyaral, it's a small scale miniatures skirmish game, involving roughly 28mm scale figures. The world itself is populated by the diminutive Fubarnii, of whom Zhontain is a somewhat overweight example!\nIf you would like to learn more then I would thoroughly recommend going and having a look at the website!\n* I also need to thank Joe Karame and Martin Clark for painting the models I've shared in this kickstarter - Joe is my regular painter and Martin had fun painting one of the master casts of the Juice Bar!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI\u2019ve successfully run four kickstarters on my own previously as well as jointly running one with Joek miniatures.

And the best part? for every stretch goal that falls, you get more episodes for exactly the same as what you'd pledge for the first one!\nOne season for the singular price of one episode!\n \nThe DESTINATION FANTASTIC Team \nSatine, Josh, Ron, Stefan and Lorraine\nStefan Pokorny: \nFounder and owner of Dwarven Forge, the industry leader in gaming terrain.\nPart artist, part philosopher, part jester, Stefan Pokorny preaches the virtues of fantasy gaming to all who will listen. Combining art, Dungeons and Dragons, and commerce, he formed his company Dwarven Forge in 1996, which has since become the gaming industry leader in the creation of miniature terrain and other fantasy sculptures. He has raised millions of dollars on Kickstarter for Dwarven Forge with the help of his legions of fans and is the subject of the documentary The Dwarvenaut, which premiered at SXSW in 2016. As an artist, he believes in travelling the world to see and experience all it has to offer in person.\nSatine Phoenix: \nGaming celebrity and former ambassador for D&D. About to go on a promotional tour of Europe for D&D.\nA consummate storyteller and lifelong creative, Satine Phoenix has always had a passion for building worlds and growing communities. She began filming Dungeons and Dragons games in 2009 which led to the inception of Celebrity Charity D20 with Keith Baker, a livestreamed gaming event benefiting Reach Out and Read. From there, she has worked on hundreds of Dungeons and Dragons events and is often called the \u2018Queen of D&D\u2019. Her impact on the tabletop community has been acknowledged in such publications as Forbes, Time Magazine, io9, and Maxim. Wherever the story leads her, Satine has proven time and again that the language of play is a universal one, bringing people together through the power of imagination.\n Josh Bishop: Award Winning Filmmaker\nAfter years of creating short form fiction and other content, Josh Bishop\u2019s first documentary feature Made In Japan, premiered at SXSW 2015 in Austin, Texas. It took the 2015 festival circuit by storm and won quite a few awards including Best Documentary at the Global Visons Film Festival and the Discovery Award for Best First Feature at the Calgary International Film Festival. Josh\u2019s sophomore documentary feature, The Dwarvenaut, premiered at SXSW 2016 and is available on most streaming platforms. Real stories and real human emotions are the heart of Josh\u2019s work.\nRon Harbin: Award Winning TV Producer\nIn 2000, Ron Harbin, a former Nashville music industry insider, found himself in the television production business. After a move to Santa Monica, he began traveling to exotic places with network specials and a variety of television series. Leading productions around the world for some of today\u2019s biggest shows has made him a highly sought-after producer.  Today, Ron\u2019s work is featured on Discovery, History, A&E, PBS, HGTV, CMT, along with many digital platforms.\nStretch goals\nOnce we lock picture on episode 1, there is only one strategy in mind for Destination Fantastic stretch goals; more episodes!\nThat's right, for every milestone we pass, another episode slides into the pipeline, beginning in New Zealand and continuing onward and outward for as long as your support sustains us. The New Zealand episode has already been prepped and scouted, and merely awaits the presence of our amazing explorers!  \nStefan and Satine will survey some of the key locations of the LOTR films on both the North and South islands, and will seek out the wily Peter Jackson himself to catch a glimpse into the process of fantasy filmmaking! A tour of the special effects studio WETA Workshop is also in store for our intrepid hosts!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe beauty of this project is that we have the first episode practically in the bag, and just need a little support nudging it over the finish line! Any subsequent stretch goal episodes you unlock will be added to the appropriate tiers at no additional cost!\n\nFrom Executive Producer Ron Harbin:\n\n\u2022 How are we going to spend all this money?\n\nI know that is the question on everyone\u2019s mind. 20 years ago, when I saw my first TV production budget, it blew my mind that a few frames of video could cost that much. I just thought you grab a camera and point it at the star and that was it. Boy! Was I ever wrong? After the producer revived me with some smelling salts and started to explain how the world worked, I understood and I think you will, too.\n\n\u2022 The people who are supported by your pledge.\n\nWhether it is the people you see on your screen or the people cleaning up after them, everyone has to get paid. And, more importantly, everyone deserves to get paid. The people who work on television and film productions are some of the hardest working and most dedicated people I know.\n\nThe hours are long and tiring. Riding a plane, bus, van, car, rickshaw, mule or whatever else you can think of, all while carrying enough equipment and tools to whittle a Tesla out of driftwood, takes its toll on the mind and the body. Sleeping in different time zone, every night, will lead to a level of confusion\u2026\u2026.what was I saying?\n\nWe stay gone for long periods of time and miss first days of school and birthday parties and bedtime stories. By the time we get back from one trip, it seems like it is time to leave on the next one. We kiss our kids and get back on the plane and the weird thing is\u2026most of us can\u2019t get enough. We love what we do and that is what keeps us going.\nAnd going. And going. And going.\n\n\u2022 Physical Production\n\nThe process of taking a cast and crew out into the world can get really expensive, really fast. Air travel, hotels, food and everyday expenses really start to add up when you\u2019re trekking across the globe for 2-3 weeks, at a time, especially if you\u2019re in an extreme or remote environment. Think about how much that last trip to Orlando cost you and the family!\n\nThe tools we use to make the show this beautiful do not come cheap, either. A travel based show needs to have equipment that can endure the elements (you may have seen a picture of me floating around where I am carrying a camera in the pouring rain on an Icelandic beach) while producing a high-quality image. Cameras, microphones, drones, hard drives, stabilizers, and more: if any of these items fail on the road, we can quickly find ourselves with no show. We want to show you the best, so we use the best.\n\n\u2022 Editing, Sound Editing, Post Production\n\nAfter we\u2019ve gone out into the world to shoot something amazing, an entirely new group of people gets involved to make sure everything looks and sounds as amazing as it did, in person. They want your experience, at home, to feel like you\u2019re there with us, on location. Not to mention, they usually catch (and fix) a few (*more than a few) mistakes made by yours truly!\n\nThe post production team is critical. We shoot dozens of hours of footage per episode, and believe me, you would tune out pretty quickly if you had to sit through all of it. Our post team works its special kind of magic to make sure that the show we end up with is the snappy, compelling, beautiful, crazy, nerdy, rock \u2018n roll travel adventure that we set out to bring to you.\n\n\u2022 Kickstarter\n\nAnd that\u2019s just the \u2018How to Pay for A Television Series\u2019 part of the story. \n\nThen, there is the \u2018How Much Does Running a Kickstarter Campaign Cost\u2019 part. \n\nWell\u2026let me tell you. That is where it gets really interesting. The short answer, though, is\u2026a lot! Kickstarter is an important platform in the independent business world. They, too, deserve our support. There are fees associated with running a campaign and, combined with credit card fees, total about 8% of the total amount raised. Add that to the cost of producing and sending all of our backers the fantastic rewards we have created and that means about $.35 out of every dollar is already spent the moment our campaign reaches its funding goal.\n\nAdd this all up and I promise you, the money you provide to help this production is well cared for and will be spent as responsibly as possible. Our goal is always to deliver the best product imaginable and as much of it as we possibly can. We appreciate the trust you have placed in us, by pledging your support, and we refuse to let you down.\n\nThank you,\n\nRon Harbin\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 3 or more", "title": "Onlookers", "descp": "You're helping us put art into the world!\nA heartfelt hank you + EXCLUSIVE INFO UPDATES, behind-the-scenes access, videos, and more!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2019"}], "stat": ["82 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "Friends of the Realm", "descp": "An astounding digital postcard of our Iceland adventures!\nPlus a heartfelt thank you + EXCLUSIVE INFO UPDATES, behind-the-scenes access, videos, and more!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2019"}], "stat": ["35 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 15 or more", "title": "Nomad", "descp": "The HD digital edition of Episode One of Destination Fantastic, the Iceland Excursion!

Our casters have long experience in producing fine quality castings in both materials and have a proven track record of delivering on time.\nWant just one model from the set? No problem. Fancy a handpicked skirmish force? Again, easily done. Want a whole skirmish warband with some additional huge centrepiece beasties? We've got you covered.\nWhile all of the main warband models are already moulded and cast, this is a Kickstarter, not a preorder for shipping-ready product - and most have yet to reach the head of our painting queue. Pictures show either painted master castings or the original master sculpts. Hoping to update with more painted pics during the campaign!\nInclude any of these inidividual models to your Pledge by adding the cost marked on the lower right corner of each pic to your Pledge - eg. add Stumpff to a ROT GRUB Pledge for a total of \u00a34.\nSingle piece unpainted white metal miniature.\nCackling maniacally, Stumpff leads the dwarven cohort with word and with spell. Terrible mansplainer.\n24mm to the top of his head. One piece white metal model.\nTwo piece unpainted white metal miniature.\nKeeping his ridiculous beard meticulously clean while slathering the rest of his being in ordure, Saw uses the cursed mace Pestle to grind skulls to paste. Loves folk music.\n24mm tall multipart white metal miniature\nTwo piece unpainted white metal miniature.\nThoroughly disagreeable to every last inch of his four foot six height, Skaphion channels his anger towards chopping enemies into easily digestible chunks. Hobbies: woodcarving, philately.\n23mm to the crest of his helm.\nTwo-part unpainted white metal miniature.\nNobody has ever seen Kopron outside of his armour and foetid robes. He communicates in grunts and a variable flaring of the baleful glow from his skull sockets. The ultimate socially awkward wallflower, he much prefers two-handed bladeswinging to Karaoke.\n32mm to his rusty eyehole.\nSingle piece unpainted white metal miniature.\nSent to act as servitor to Sorceror Maldred, this creature can disappear like smoke, reforming to catch victims unawares as it spreads pestilence. Huge repertoire of folk songs. Very stabby. \nSingle piece unpainted white metal model.\nBeloved of the goddess, she spreads the Rotten Word and blesses the fallen with the caress of her tentacle and the fumes from her censer. Skilled spider wrangler. Fave colour: purple.\n31mm to her eye level. White metal miniature.\nMultipart unpainted white metal miniature.\nBlessed by the Powers, Hinrich\u2019s single eye allows him to see an opponent\u2019s next move so that he can outfight anyone.

GSOH, central heating, all his own teeth.\nSingle-piece white metal miniature.\nSingle piece unpainted resin model.\nA snivelling, slithering wet mass of teeth, toes, and tusks, Spot hung around the campfire waiting for scraps and now follows the warband everywhere. Good with children and animals, hates cats. \n60mm diameter, 50mm+ tall resin miniature cast in one piece.\nTwo piece unpainted resin miniature.\nYoungest of the two troll mercenaries in Maldred's employ, Sobell's job description in the warcompany's roster lists him as \"Blunt Force Technician\".\n60mm tall to the top of his skull. Resin two part miniature.\nMultipart unpainted resin model kit.\nEldest brother of the Troll Twins (NB they're \"twins\" only for professional/tax reasons), Rollo is the sophisticated heavy of the warband and considers himself a connoisseur of elf heads.\n60mm to the top of his head. Three piece resin miniature kit.\nSingle piece unpainted white metal model.\nAdaon is on the trail of the Warband, having been Geased to bring back the heads of the Troll Twins. He's not quite figured out yet that he doesn't necessarily need twin axes to take twin heads... \nWhite metal miniature. 20mm to the top of his head; 25mm to the top of his haircut.\nSingle piece unpainted white metal miniature.\nGwystyl has had a run-in with the Warband before now, losing his eye to Putriss' barbed tentacle some years back and swearing vengeance ever since. He really is old enough to know better with that haircut by now, though.\nWhite metal miniature. 20mm to the top of his forehead; 32mm to the crest of his frohawk.\n\nChoose from a  number of one-click Pledges for different rewards - add any individual models to any Pledge by simply increasing your Pledge by that amount.\neg. to add Skaphion and Saw to a BLOWFLY Pledge, increase your Pledge from \u00a325 to \u00a334\nPick any individual models, and customise your Pledge.\nAll three Plague Dwarfs.

We're old school gamers with a background in professional modelmaking and prototyping, with a combined experience of over 60 years. As well as Cthulhu Wars, our regular sculptors have worked for some of the biggest names in the wargaming and tabletop industry, including Games Workshop, Reaper, Ral Partha, Wizards of the Coast, and many more. \nMacrocosm Miniatures and Shed Games, our casters, are full time metal and resin casters with a proven track record working with small manufacturers and on fulfilment of numerous recent kickstarters over the last couple of years.\nWhite metal models in this campaign are mostly single-part; some have separate weapons and shields or separate hands with weapons attached.\nResin models are mostly multipart and will require some assembly.\nAll models should require a minimum amount of cleanup and prep ahead of undercoating and painting - nothing more than normally required for any equivalent tabletop gaming miniatures. Both resin and metal miniatures can be fixed with cyano / superglues and may benefit from pinning at joints.\nPostage costs will be calculated on completion of your pledge, during the backer survey stage of the campaign, and will be dependent on final weight/volume of your base reward and any add-ons you may have chosen. All parcels will be sent by tracked/signed-for services through Royal Mail - delivery times will vary according to country of final destination.These shippings costs will vary greatly depending on the weight/bulk of any add-ons you choose - we're confidently estimating  (postal price increases notwithstanding) that this will add between \u00a35-20 per customer for tracked/signed for mail, with highest costs being applied to overseas and/or large pledges. For example, a FULL ROTTEN ARMY pledge (packed weight just over 1 kilo) posting to the USA would need an additional \u00a320 shipping added in the Pledge Manager).\nCosts include not just Royal Mail's actual postage charges  -  shown here (https://www.royalmail.com/sites/default/files/royal-mail-our-prices-25-march-2019-46305575.pdf) but also enough to cover actual costs of packing materials.\nFenris Games is not liable for any customs or handling fees you may be charged by your country on import of your reward(s). ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAll of the sculpts for this project are already finished - there will be no added delays waiting for pieces to be finished. Master moulds for most of the models have already been made and test castings poured (hence the painted examples shown in the campaign) - a successful campaign here will allow the manufacture of Production Moulds and, shortly thereafter, the mass casting of both white metal and resin models.\n\nWe have two dedicated subcontract casters ready and waiting to start work on making the models needed for fulfilment of your Pledge. As soon as those all-important funds arrive, resin and metal will begin to pour!\n\nWe've been making moulds and casting resin for over 30 years, and have partnered with a hugely reliable subcontract casting company whose work meets our high standards. They've made test moulds and pre-production castings of the warband models to measure mould wear and longevity, so already have a handle on production time, wear & tear, and amounts of materials needed.\n\nThis is our third Kickstarter. We've learned a huge amount from our first two, and know just which pitfalls to avoid and how best to deal with any new challenges. Our previous campaign - Rubble City - is over 90% fulfilled and expected to complete within another few weeks at time of writing. While there have been delays to production of the handcast resin components, these have been largely due to bereavement and the emotional and practical fallout that resulted.

THIS BUST IS FREE FOR BACKERS OVER 170 EUROS.\nAlso, we have the Stretch Goals of the Campaign. Each time we reach a new Stretch Goal, we will unlock freebies and new Add-ons to buy.  We will update periodically.\n\n\nYES, it reminds classic but it is new.\nThe N-Paint colors have been manufactured in the UK by the best modeling paint developers in the world, with more than 40 years of experience, authors of the most famous paints you have used during your life.\nWe used a classic formulation with some improvements. N-Paint has the perfect creamy texture you need, and the right coverage for a brilliant transparency on layers. We created a new formula for a perfect easy blending with high pigmentation. An enhanced matte finish without losing intensity, the cleanest colors for an elegant and smooth work.\nJoin the PAINTSPLOSION!\nForget about sand texture and muted colors. N-Paint is matte enough, but anyway you can adjust the slightly satin level of the finish, if you need it, by adding a drop of our Ultra Matte Solution into your mixes. This way you can reach an extremelly matte finish without losing intensity of color. This is how we paint, give a try! \nOur Inks are deeply pigmented and they have a little satin finish, but much less glossy than others. They can be used directly undiluted, or mixed with normal colors and metallics to reach incredibly intense tones. Also they will get completelly matte if you add Ultra Matte Solution to them, while they keep their high pigmentation and liquidity.\nOur Metallic colors are designed to have the best covering and strong colors, including a extreme light valid for every tone. They go well directly and combined with inks. You will need nothing else.\nN-Paint is very resistant! It can be used for wargames as well as professional painting or fine arts. Its consistency and fluidity does not disintegrate and it can be used both brush and airbrush. Its tonal variety makes it perfect to be used by themselves or combined with any other water based paint on the market.\nBut the greatest quality of N-Paint is not in its physical characteristics, but in what it allows you to do chromatically. The mixes made by Jes\u00fas Mart\u00edn, who created the colors of Vallejo Acrylics Fantasy Pro line, have exceeded expectations, achieving a balanced range of colors that will bring you closer both to Nocturna painting style and the extremes of the most radical painting you can think of.\nLive the N-Paint experience. A world of new colors is waiting for you. \nFor those who want a Basic Set to start trying our N-Paints, we have designed a Starter Paint Set composed with some basic colors for a first contact. All of them are included in their own paint set, they are just a selection.\n The Full Range of N-Paint Colors is composed by 8 Sets of 8 Colors, and the Auxiliary Paint Set (White, Black and Matte Medium).\n\nN-Paint rules. We don\u00b4t say that, our testers can tell you. Anyway, follow them because they are some of the best painters out there!\nMarc Masclans  @masclans_miniatures \nAleksandra Tana Cvetanovski  @craftworldstudio \nMichal P Lan @lanstudio \nIv\u00e1n Hortal  @ivan_hortal_miniature_painter  \nArnau L\u00e1zaro  @arnau.lazaro \nAndy Wardle   @andywardle_artwork \nFlameon  @flameonminiatures \nArkaitz   @nohacademy \nAaron Lovejoy  @aaronlovejoy \nArsies    @arsiesstudio  \nKirill Kanaev  Yellow_one \nKrzysztof Kobalczyk   Krzysztof \nBanshee  @miniatureartacademy \nJesukrypton  @jesus_nocturna \n\u00d3scar  @rrwatercolor \nTHESE ARE THE ELIGIBLE FIGURES OF THE CAMPAING.\nWe have remade 3 of our classic figures, Nocturna, The Sorcerer and El Juglar.

Since the hoodie crows had appeared there was a change in the air, their cawing giving voice to a restlessness the toys had not known before. The dark woods beckoned.\u201d\nLeft at the Bottom of the Garden is a project to fund the production of nine high quality, lead-free metal miniatures, each depicting a lost toy. Help me begin to tell their story in miniature form as the toys set off on their journey through the dark and twisted woods.\nAs the owner and sculptor of Statuesque Miniatures, I've produced many miniatures over the years. However, these figures are something quite different in style and purpose from my usual work and that's why I've come to Kickstarter to help reach as many people as possible. With your help, I can get production rolling and the toys can venture out into the world.\nThe Miniatures\nMeasuring approximately 14mm to 32mm tall, the Left at the Bottom of the Garden miniatures represent a motley collection of abandoned or lost toys. I sculpted the miniatures with tabletop gaming, painting and collecting in mind. In particular, I wanted them to be nice little objects in themselves, needing no glue, no assembly beyond normal casting clean-up and no plastic bases. They have bold, chunky details meaning they can be easily painted or finished however you wish.\nAll photos show production castings of the miniatures (albeit prepped and given a coat of boot polish to bring out the details), so if the Kickstarter is successful I'll be ready to start casting your miniatures immediately. There won't be any stretch goals or additional items added during the course of the campaign - I don't want anything to delay fulfilment.\nPlease note, due to their small size the Left at the Bottom of the Garden miniatures are not intended for small children.\nWhat are the toys peering at in the inky blackness? One of the hoodies is definitely whispering something mean in Clementine's ear.\nThe Pledges\nBelow you can see each of the pledge levels available. With the exception of the Fancy Toys reward, all miniatures are supplied in bare metal state.\nChoose any set or sets of miniatures from the Add On list below. Simply pledge the total for those sets. Details of your choices will be taken after the campaign.\nThe complete set of nine Left at the Bottom of the Garden miniatures, cast in high quality, lead-free metal.\nAdditional sets of miniatures can also be chosen from the Add On list below.

Details of your choices will be taken after the campaign.\nThe complete set of nine Left at the Bottom of the Garden miniatures, cast in high quality, lead-free metal and hand finished by me to match the display miniatures seen in the campaign photos on this page. This will involve the removal of any casting artefacts, a light buffing, ageing with boot polish to bring out the details and a coat of lacquer.\nAdditional sets of miniatures can be chosen from the Add On list below. Simply add the total cost for those sets to the pledge level. Details of your choices will be taken after the campaign. Please note, any additional miniatures added to this pledge will NOT be hand finished and will be supplied in a bare metal state.\nThis pledge level is limited to 10 backers.\nAdd Ons\nThe following items can be added to any pledge for the amount indicated.

All rewards sent to Russia (Europe shipping), Brazil and Canada (World Zone 1) will be sent by International Tracked mail only and charged appropriately, while rewards sent to Mexico (World Zone 1) will be sent by International Signed mail only and charged appropriately.

We have worked hard over the past years to create a new range of resin miniatures capable of making your little heart race at a million beats a minute. At long last, here we are, eager to throw ourselves into this new adventure like a lemming on the edge of a cliff! With \u2018The Second Government of Inneath\u2019, we want to repeat the wonderful experience of two years ago and, if possible, raise the bar a few notches. Just as with \u2018The Iron Crows\u2019, our goal has been to make you fall in love with us and our creations, \"The Second Government of Inneath\" was born to remind you that, despite the passing of years, in our eyes, you are still as beautiful as the day we met.\nTHE BACKER'S PORTAL: I made a page on our website to track all the progress of this campaign in the next months of wait (I know, it will be hard to wait!!). At this moment, obviously, the page is almost blank, but it will be updated regularly with all the news and important info concerning this campaign. Go to the Backer's Portal.\nWe have a single purpose: to create miniatures that are worthy of great heights. Or, at least metaphorically; in as much as 32mm miniatures can be. We sculpted 20 new characters and a solid range of Stretch Goals to give you the very best of the greatest human nation of Inneath: The Second Government. All our miniatures are casted in high quality resin, the best way to give you miniatures as faithful as possible to the original sculpt: if you took part in our previous Kickstarter (the blessing of Grundur be upon you!), you already have proof of how uncompromising we are when it comes to the quality of our products. On the other hand, if this is your first experience with us then you are even luckier! Now we have two more years of creative and technical experience that give us a firm belief that this Kickstarter will be even better than the last.\nPLAY\n\nSee the 3d sculpts of some of our characters in literally every single details on Sketchfab: you will be able to rotate and zoom at your leisure the 3d sculpts (warning: it could be addictive). \nNDT: we strongly believe that humans have different heights. Or at least, this is what I learned when I met a Latvian guy and I seemed like his backpack, comparing our heights. For this reason, our human characters represent individuals with different heights and their miniatures reflect this concept, going approximately from 34 to 41mm size.\nHave I failed to dismiss your doubts? Feel free to write to us at info@durginpaintforge.com if you have any more questions!\nYou will be able to support this project and contribute to the success of this range in three ways: you can select the miniatures you like individually, pounce on the convenient bundles for some bulk savings or, if you have an impassioned heart but only a few doubloons in your pocket, we would greatly appreciate if you could share this project far and wide, to wherever you think people might be interested.\nIf you are only interested in some specific miniatures from the range, take a look at the table below, crack out a sheet of paper, a pencil and some rounded-tip scissors. Note down the miniatures that interest you and add up their individual prices. Their total will be the amount that you will need to insert as your pledge amount. After the campaign is completed, we will send out a pledge manager in which you will be able to sort out the details of which miniatures you want. \nIf you are interested in buying a bundle, simply select the appropriate pledge and enjoy the anticipation of that little box of goodies being dropped on your doorstep (if you still have those scissors ready, you could cut out some nice origami to pass the time!).\n \"What if I want to buy more bundles? Or add more miniatures to my bundle?\"\nEasier than shooting an Elf in a barrel (don't feel bad, he deserves it). Just select the reward you are interested in, then modify your pledge by adding the value of the miniatures or any other bundles you want to add; voila!\nIt wouldn't be a Kickstarter campaign without a constant range of freebies raining down on you like a benevolent monsoon. As you can see, each bundle has a specific list of Stretch Goals available, if unlocked: obviously, if you buy, for example, the Redcoats Bundle and the Bluecoats Bundle you will receive all the unlocked Stretch Goals of both. The Stretch Goals that will be unlocked will be added to your bundle for free but if you want more copies of them, you can buy them adding their individual prices to your pledge (see the voice \"Add on:\" on the various Stretch Goals graphics)\nAfter the campaign, as usual, you will be able to take part to our Pledge Manager Event. Of course, the Iron Crows range will be able also on the Pledge Manager, including the same bundles that we offered during their campaign. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe main risk, concerning a project like this one, is about the times of delivery. During our previous campaign we had, luckily, an unexpected success and we unlocked a lot of unplanned sculptures: we were overwhelmed by gratitude and happiness, but we lost almost 5 months to sculpt all the features unlocked. Moreover, our previous resin caster overbooked its schedule, which led to several quality problems and we lost several months to replace the bad resins, because, as any decent creator would do, we couldn't accept to send to our backers anything but high-quality miniatures. To avoid a similar situation, during these last two years we worked hard to start this new campaign with a better organization: we have already sculpted all the main range of characters including a solid amount of Stretch Goals and we have already started to 3d prints the first miniatures. This, for sure, will strongly optimize our production, allowing us to respect our schedule. Moreover, we found new partners, concerning the resin casts, that will surely grant us to better manage a large production maintaining the high quality that we expect for any of our products.\nIf, as during the previous campaign, we will unlock more unplanned features (which would mean exceeding the 36.000\u20ac funding goal) it may happen that our schedule will be slightly delayed, to allow us to properly design and sculpt them.\nOur first goal is to create something worthy of your expectations and we organized this campaign to be better than our previous one, concerning the times of delivery.

We were lucky enough to have people enjoy our stories. During this time, our comics were read over 20 million times, were shared by hundreds of thousands of people and most surreal of all, are now being taught in US high-schools.\nEach of our comics tells a short, unique story: A woman who becomes obsessed with a radio station that only appears in the middle of the night, a man in a post-apocalyptic wasteland, trying to collect all the healthy animals in a modern Noah's ark, and a cranky old man who might just have a time machine in the guest bedroom.\nHere's one comics. A twisted little love story called COLD EMBRACE:\nNow, we\u2019re collecting all 15 of our comics stories for the first time, in a beautiful 144 page hardcover book.

We hope you\u2019ll join us in bringing it to life.\nABOUT THE BOOK\nWe\u2019re obsessed with making this book the most beautiful object we can. We\u2019ve spent the last months testing different types of paper and debating foil-stamp colors. And now, it\u2019s finally time to make the book a reality. \n The book will be a cloth-bound, foil-stamped, oversized hardcover (The size of Marvel and DCs deluxe hardcovers). It will be printed on thick, durable paper.\n To make this book as gorgeous as possible, we\u2019ve teamed up with Mark Vierra of On The Mark printing. Mark has printed some of the most funded and beautifully produced books in Kickstarter\u2019s history (Steve Lichman and Scurry among others).\nPLAY\n\n ABOUT THE REWARD TIERS\nWe want to keep things simple and want every item we offer to be of the highest quality possible. For this reason, we\u2019re offering only 3 reward tiers: \nNote: If you\u2019re a comics store and would like to order Multiple copies of our book, please get in touch with us at: midnightradioks@gmail.com. We\u2019d love to help.\nABOUT THE STRETCH GOALS\nWe wanted to make the stretch goals as cool and beautifully printed as the book itself. We only chose things we\u2019d love to have, so we really hope you\u2019ll like them too!\nWe love this design. That about sums it up. Once we reach $45k we will include the bookmark with every copy of the book. \nOnce we reach $50k, every backer who ordered the limited-edition and original art versions of the book will receive the entire set of 4 signed and numbered mini-prints.\nThis one we've been obsessed with from the very beginning. Once we reach $55k, all backers who ordered the book will receive a copy of the 32 page MIDNIGHT RADIO COLORING BOOK! Like the name says, it\u2019s a coloring book, featuring Yael\u2019s gorgeous illustrations. We hope we get to share it with you!\nABOUT GETTING THE BOOKS TO YOU \n We want to get the books to you as quickly and smoothly as possible. For that, we\u2019ve teamed up with fulfilment company Quartermaster logistics, who know how to do exactly that. Quartermaster are focused on fulfilling crowdfunding campaigns and have successfully shipped backer rewards for hundreds of campaigns. \n AND THAT'S IT!\n If you have any questions, please email us at: midnightradioks@gmail.com\nThanks for reading all of that.

Please give us a shout through the 'Ask a Question\u2019 button on our Kickstarter campaign FAQ page.\nWe can\u2019t wait to bring the entire 10-episode The Legend of Vox Machina animated series to life!\n<3\nCritical Role\nCritical Role is a weekly livestreamed tabletop roleplaying game featuring a group of prominent voice actors, who happen to be best friends. Each week, veteran Game Master Matthew Mercer leads the cast through epic adventures set in the world of Exandria! Trust us \u2014 it\u2019s rad.  \nOur original storyline centered on a group of heroes known as Vox Machina \u2014 Pike Trickfoot (gnome cleric, Ashley Johnson), Keyleth (half-elf druid, Marisha Ray), Percival \u201cPercy\u201d Fredrickstein Von Musel Klossowski de Rolo III (human gunslinger, Taliesin Jaffe), Grog Strongjaw (goliath barbarian, Travis Willingham), Scanlan Shorthalt (gnome bard, Sam Riegel), Vex\u2019ahlia (half-elf ranger, Laura Bailey), and Vax\u2019ildan (half-elf rogue, Liam O\u2019Brien) \u2014 as they battled the forces of evil and learned to work as a team. Their epic tale concluded in November, 2017 after 115 episodes and 373 hours of gameplay.\nThe show is still going strong, now over 50 episodes in to our second season, which tracks the misfits known as the Mighty Nein. Critical Role reaches a wide, international audience called Critters, who are just about the greatest fans in history. \n Titmouse is an Emmy award-winning animation production company behind the hits Big Mouth, The Venture Bros., Metalocalypse, Niko and the Sword of Light and Star Wars: Galaxy of Adventures. One of the largest 2D animation studios in America with studios in Los Angeles, New York and Vancouver, B.C., it employs more than 400 of the most talented people in the industry (all guaranteed to be 100% human). Its fresh styles can be seen on major networks such as Disney, Adult Swim, Cartoon Network and streaming services like Amazon and Netflix.  \nVox Machina is back, baby \u2014 but this time they\u2019re cartoons! Here\u2019s the amazing creative team that\u2019s gonna take our tale from imagination to animation...  \nArt by Critter Hunter Bonyun (@deerlordhunter)\nWRITING TEAM\nA brand new story was crafted by the cast of Critical Role and scripted by our good friend and talented TV writer, Jennifer Muro (Star Wars: Forces of Destiny, Spider-Man, Justice League: Action). Muro is one of the most sought-after writers in the industry and she\u2019s written an in-canon adventure that takes place before the events of the streaming show. \nANIMATION TEAM\nTo bring the magic and mayhem of Exandria to life, we\u2019re sinking the vast majority of our resources into the animation budget. As Titmouse has proven again and again, they pride themselves on top notch quality and attention to detail, ensuring this story will be told with visceral, action-packed visuals. It\u2019ll be bloody gorgeous.\nVOICEOVER\nThe voice acting for The Legend of Vox Machina will (of course) be provided by the cast of Critical Role, who bring decades of experience to the table. You\u2019ve no doubt heard their voices in some of your favorite cartoons \u2014 Teen Titans Go!, Ben 10, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Attack on Titan, Dragon Ball Z, Sofia the First, Avengers Assemble, DuckTales, Transformers, and many, many more. And to round out the main cast, we\u2019ll bring in some extra special celebrity cameos, as well as voice over industry legends. \nOTHER DETAILS\nIn The Legend of Vox Machina, our adventuring group is right around Level 7 \u2014 fledgling adventurers, but still powerful enough to fire off exciting spells and brutal attacks.\nSo, what will this campaign allow us to create? A bitchin\u2019 high-quality, fantasy cartoon set in a world created by one of the most accomplished storytellers, Matthew Mercer. With heart-stopping action and side-splitting comedy, it will have something for everyone. \nIf we smash through our crowdfunding goal, The Legend of Vox Machina will be released in Fall 2020. But we can\u2019t do it without your help funding this campaign \u2014 which ends on Thursday, April 18th at 11:59pm Pacific.\nUPDATE (MARCH 7TH):\nDue to the overwhelming love and support of our amazing backers, we're creating an animated series!\nAs a quick refresher: the first few episodes of our animation will focus on a brand new Vox Machina adventure, which takes place before our show began streaming live on Twitch. But because of your incredible generosity, we\u2019re following your lead and going for it, diving right into a series that begins the retelling of the saga of Vox Machina. We can\u2019t wait to show you how the story shapes up!\nWe're excited to share new episode offerings as part of our new stretch goals for our campaign: The Briarwoods are coming to animated life in The Legend of Vox Machina!\nThe Briarwoods arc is one of the most exciting and popular storylines of the Vox Machina streaming campaign. When we were brainstorming about what might come next, the clear winner was introducing the Briarwoods into The Legend of Vox Machina.\nThe Briarwoods arc story so far\u2026 Vox Machina arrive in Percy's hometown, Whitestone, to avenge the murder of his family and the corruption of his city at the hands of the evil Briarwoods. Danger and betrayal lurk around every corner, and it will take all of Vox Machina's abilities to combat this deadly threat. The Briarwoods arc began in episode 24 of our first streamed campaign, and remains one of our absolute favorites.\nFor the last batch of stretch goals that we crush, we\u2019ll be able to create two additional 22-minute Briarwoods arc episodes.\nSo, to recap, here\u2019s what you can expect episode-wise from The Legend of Vox Machina animated SERIES:\n Episodes 1 & 2: A brand new story centered around Vox Machina at level 7 (FUNDED!)\n Episodes 3, 4, 5, 6: Briarwoods arc! (FUNDED!)\n Episodes 7 & 8: Continuation of Briarwoods arc (FUNDED!)\n Episodes 9 & 10: Continuation and conclusion of Briarwoods arc (FUNDED!)\nBe sure to check out our backer updates tab at the top of this page for the full download.\nUPDATE (APRIL 5TH):\nWe have unlocked our final stretch goal and now, we\u2019ll make the entire 10-episode The Legends of Vox Machina series for you AND a one-shot GMed by our very own Ashley Johnson! \nAt the moment, we\u2019re not planning on adding additional stretch goals -- every dollar that we raise after this point will be allocated directly into making an even more kick ass animation. This means more animators, more music, and more awesomeness. Of course, if that changes, we\u2019ll be sure to let everyone know as soon as possible.\nIn our wildest dreams, we never thought that we\u2019d be able to bring an entire Vox Machina SERIES to life. But, time and time again, you all continue to challenge our expectations in the best way. We cannot thank you enough and we cannot wait to roll up our sleeves and get started. \nTravis & Sam went on dozens of Hollywood pitch meetings, and found some interest \u2014 but we ultimately decided to create our first animated special on our own. By doing so, we can continue to stay true to our beloved characters and tell the stories you want to see. With an ever-burning desire to bring a Vox Machina animation to the masses, we decided to give the power back to our amazing community, roll up our sleeves, and make this special with YOU instead. \nEvery dollar you contribute allows us to embark on this animated adventure together, with the ultimate goal of producing a full-blown animated series. We\u2019ll keep you posted on how the project is going \u2014 with behind-the-scenes looks at the animation process, recording sessions, reward product creation, and everything in-between. As a backer, you are part of our team and we guarantee you\u2019ll feel empowered and informed every step of the way.   \nCONTRIBUTE if you have the means to do so! Backers will get updates along the way, receive awesome rewards, and be the first to know when the show is ready for prime time.\nSHARE with your friends and family. Even if your loved ones don\u2019t know Critical Role yet, a super badass cartoon is a perfect way to introduce them to it. Help us spread the good word! \nAlong with making the 22-minute animated series of our dreams, the money raised through this campaign will allow us to provide cool rewards and administer our crowdfunding project. \nIt\u2019s incredibly important that we remain transparent, so we created this handy chart to show you exactly where your hard-earned money will go. \nThe overwhelming majority of our funds raised will support the production of our animated special \u2014 from our incredible animation team to voiceover studio time, soundtrack composition, music, effects, sound design, etc.\nOf course, we have accounted for some boring (but important!) stuff too \u2014 like credit card processing fees, accounting, and additional staff to keep this project running at full steam. \nWe wanted to give you the coolest and most high-quality rewards, all of which are exclusive to this crowdfunding campaign, which means you won\u2019t be able to find this swag anywhere else! \n We\u2019re thrilled to offer you a selection of campaign-exclusive perks as a thank you for supporting The Legend of Vox Machina. We\u2019ve set it up this way to guarantee that most of your funds go towards creating the best damn cartoon possible. After countless creative meetings, we created this set of sweet products that we would be proud to own ourselves.    \nEach time we hit a new goal together, we'll share our new crowdfunding goal with you! This means more swag and some bad ass Vox Machina one-shots that will unlock for everyone (backers or not!).   \nFirst, check out our Kickstarter FAQ on our campaign page. We will update this page as often as possible to ensure that the answers that you seek are readily available. \nIf your question isn\u2019t covered in the FAQ, feel free to drop us a note by hitting the \u2018Ask a question\u2019 button on the FAQ page. \nSpecial thanks to Critter Jessica Mahon (@my2k) for creating the portrait art for our campaign headings.

Over those two decades I\u2019ve visited large areas of Anyaral and we now have well over 100 unique playable units for the game (not to mention all the different variants, civilians and a wide variety of critters...), all in the usual World of Twilight scale (roughly 28mm).\nIf you are new to Anyaral, then I recommend you go and visit the World of Twilight website to find out more!\nOver the last year I\u2019ve continued with the normal range, but I\u2019ve also had a play with something slightly different, and that is where I need your help!\nLegends of Anyaral is a random little side project that will let me play with big buildings and creatures that simply wouldn\u2019t work in the usual scale. I took the very simplistic approach of sculpting everything half the usual size, which effectively makes it a 15mm range. The first sculpt I did was of a piece of Fubarnii architecture that I sketched during Inktober 2017; the Crooked Trade Outpost. \n\"Crooked\" from Inktober 2017\n\"We paused our travels briefly at the crooked tower of Geliad. I had initially assumed the tower was on the brink of collapse, but was assured by the locals that it was all part of their local engineer's eccentric but deliberate design! It now serves as an outpost where traders rest before braving the Moerasii marshes. We were fortunate enough to see a domesticated lorsaan being loaded with baggage. It never ceases to amaze me that such behemoths wander our lands.\" \nI wanted to create the building, but figured it would be somewhat huge in the usual scale! Instead, I halved all the dimensions, making it a much more manageable 135mm in height. Having sculpted the building I did of course need to sculpt the lorsaan to accompany it. Then a few little traders to look after the Lorsaan... Which gives a good insight into how Twilight has generally been created over the last twenty years!\nThe Crooked Trade Outpost, painted by Joe Karame\nI\u2019ve got a few other ideas I\u2019d like to do in the Legends scale (the enarii, more huge beasts!), but it depends a lot how well this project is received. I have no current plans for any rules, although that could be very tempting! That's for the future though, this kickstarter is just about the Outpost :)\nThanks to all the people who have backed so far, we have achieved our target! There are of course more things I would like to add to the campaign though...\n\nEven in the smaller scale I wasn\u2019t entirely sure how practical it would be to release the trade outpost, but the very talented Rob Huntley (Warploque) took it in hand and did an amazing job casting the tower as a single piece kit! I then worked with Rob Alderman and John Bryan to make some more production moulds that would make the set affordable to gamers as well as collectors. For this kickstarter most of the pledges will be cast by John Bryan, but I am also giving you the opportunity to get your hands on the Warploque master casts as a special collector's edition.\nI\u2019m keeping everything about this campaign simple. The campaign will run for a short period and will be very focused. I\u2019ve got a couple of ideas for extras and stretch goals (remember those traders I mentioned earlier...), but nothing that will delay delivery!\nAs soon as the campaign is over I\u2019ll get everything ordered and get the pledge manager open so I can start shipping as soon as Kickstarter release the funds.\nI\u2019m sure many of you in Europe will be a bit apprehensive about Brexit. I can't make any promises as there isn't much time, but the plan is to get all European orders shipped first (hopefully before the end of March) with the orders to the rest of the world close on their heels! \nFor this Kickstarter I\u2019ve come up with a few simple pledges, so you can get the Lorsaan or the Crooked Outpost, or everything together.\nI've also put together a special Master Quality Collector's Set, which is the definitive collector's edition. The Collector's Set includes resin Warploque master casts of the Trade Outpost and the Lorsaan. \nYou can add the following to your pledge by simply increasing your pledge value. You will then be able to specify what you would like after the campaign is over.\nThree Tiny Traders: \u00a35\nTiny Twilight (2 Knights, 4 Militia, 2 Devanu and 3 Grishak plus 1 Delgon priest and 1 KalGarkii): \u00a312\nThe Misfits (Limping Belan and Trader, Injured Knight and Militia) : \u00a36\nResin Belan: \u00a312", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe've run three larger projects previously, so have a good grasp of the challenges involved!\nThis project does involve a lot of individual resin casts, which I know can cause production delays.

We have been working on this project for over a year and we enjoyed every step along the way. From the initial ideas bouncing around in my head to the concept sketches, the sculpting process and then seeing them come alive through printing and casting. It has been a very rewarding experience and now I can finally share them with you!\nLast year might have been mostly about scifi and Cyberpunk, but this year, we will start with some fantasy love!!!\nThis campaign is about a trio (trio?!? yes, trio!) of elves known as the Dragon Masters. They raise and train dragons for others of their kin. So the dragons (technically one of them is a Wyvern but we'll count it as a dragon! ;) ) you see on the busts are not mature and fully grown dragons. But they will be! Who knows, one day we might make some proper fully grown ones...!?\nKaradhran, the male Dragon Master stands almost 80mm tall and has a width of over 115mm!\nCiadrin, the female Dragon Master stands a little over 66mm with a width of 90mm!\n\nConcept art\nThe journey starts with an idea formulating in my head. I often do some rough sketches and write down some thoughts and notes to start establishing a concrete plan for the character. The second step is finding an artist that is suited for what I have mind and then let him or her do their magic.\nIn this case Denis Zimin took my ideas and made these two concepts which I really like!\nHe is currently making them into fully coloured artworks and I hope to share them soon. \nKaradhran\nCiadrin\nRenders\nAfter the concepts are finished, the sculptor goes to work. He takes the concepts and starts sculpting them. Digitally in this case. The concept art was spot on and Radmir Achmentov, one of our regular sculptors, had a blast and this shows in the sculpts.\n\nKaradhran render\nCiadrin render\nCyara render\nPrints\nOnce the sculpting has been done and the cuts are in place, the sculpts are turned into STL files and these are sent to the printer. In our case we use Micron 3D. \nCiadrin print\nCasts\nOnce the printer has sent the prints to our caster, the moulding and casting process begins. A magical and obscure happening that I absolutely have no clue on how to do it myself so  we rather let trained professionals do their stuff! First the print/sculpt is prepared and then a master mould is made. From this master mould some test casts are made to see if everything is working properly and if so, these casts are then used to produce casting moulds. \n\nCiadran master casting (prior to clean up!)\nKaradhran master casting (prior to clean up!)\n\n\n\nWe have a few types of pledges. The regular ones that will be available throughout the campaign with the busts at a discounted price from the MSRP and...   48 hour only EARLY BIRDS!!! \nKaradhran\nCiadrin\n\nKaradhran & Ciadrin\nCyara\n\nAdd-ons! \nWe decided to add the Draken busts of Drakogor and Dragyn to this campaign as they fit right in being dragon hybrids themselves! Drakogor wa released last year and dragyn is a brand new release!\nDrakogor\nDragyn\nDrakogor & Dragyn\nThese are HUGE busts! Drakogor standing at 90mm from bottom to top and Dragyn an impressive 110mm from bottom to the top of his horns!!! \nFor more angles check here;\n https://drive.google.com/open?id=1CMjSP14DRwLniSDOznFwpa83mXnyIrW9 \n\n\nShipping will be charged during the Kickstarter. For all pledges it is \u20ac10,- which includes tracking, signed for delivery and insurance.  \nWe have set the delivery date for May 2019. Casting will begin once the campaign is over and we have funded. We believe this is a realistic date after speaking things through with our caster. \nThe company who handles our shipping proved eight times already that they do a good job. We have every faith we can deliver on time as we have become quite good at organizing and packing. We don't think there will be a delay in packages going out to backers but would just like to add that delays can happen. Once the shipping company has your parcels it is out of our control. However we will do everything possible again to fulfill this Kickstarter on time. \nPlease note that we are not responsible for any customs or other fees that might occur. \nMiniatures come unpainted and need assembly and some minor cleaning.\n\nAs always there are a few people I want to thank! The following people who's help and hard work has made it possible to do this campaign!  \nSir Castalot (mysterious and legendary caster supreme!)\nRadmir Achmentov (Punga Miniatures)\nToni Garcia Krespo (CHK Studios)\nMichal NT (Digital painter)\nKyle Cruickshank (Mr Lees Minis)\nLuke Wilson\nMicron 3D\nBulat Satuchin\n\nOne thing that is very important if you want to help us fund, is to please take a moment to share the project. You can do this by sharing the campaign on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Google+, your blog, forums and on any other Social media you might know! \nTell your friends who might be interested and with your help we can make this project as successful as possible, ensuring we can make many more wonderful busts and miniatures in the near future!  \nYou can follow us here: \nhttps://www.facebook.com/OuroborosMiniatures/\nhttps://ouroborosminiatures.blogspot.nl/\nhttps://www.instagram.com/ouroborosminiatures/\nhttps://twitter.com/OuroborosMinis\nhttps://ouroborosminiatures.com ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe Dragon Masters have already been sculpted, moulded and (test) cast.

We will collect this via our pledge manager after the campaign ends, using PayPal. This is so we can be fair to all our backers as shipping is rarely one size fits all, and also give you more stretch goodies and possibly a choice of carrier options.\nWe will ship your rewards at our cost to our international hubs.

Keep in mind these are just estimates, and costs may rise based on weight increases from unlocked stretch goals and any optional buys you choose.\nUSA: $10-$20 to most states. $50 to Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. \nCANADA: $15-$30 to most cities. \nLATIN AMERICA: $70-$80 to most countries. \nASIA: $10 to China, Hong Kong, and Singapore. $35 to most other countries (we can\u2019t predict an estimate cost to Malaysia).

We hope that the special price and exclusive items you will get during the Kickstarter will make up for any such possible lag. However, if this is something that is not acceptable to you, please do not back this project, and instead wait for the retail release. Thank you for your understanding. \nBe aware that all pledges that are confirmed after the pledge manager deadline will be shipped from the US hub at a later date. For non-US backers that will likely incur increased shipping costs. We also cannot ship to PO Boxes domestically or internationally.

This campaign is to help us fund the first model in our new Wasteland Raiders line called Fast Johnny. In doing so we can hopefully realise a few more of the riders that we have in mind for this range.\nDigitally coloured render of Fast Johnny by Miranda Bosch-Thurlings\nFast Johnny, the model in question, has a kind of ironic meaning to us personally. It didn't start out like that of course but this year has been really odd and intense for us. A rollercoaster ride of epic proportions with great highs and deep lows! \nYou see we started out this year with a very successful campaign called CP New Skin. The result from that campaign made sure we could do a lot of the things we had planned for this year. We try to very loosely plan a year ahead and for 2018 we wanted to try and release between 20-25 miniatures and busts. So when the New Skin campaign ended much better than we ever could have imagined, we had good confidence that we would be able to do all the things we wanted at a steady pace. Boy oh boy were we wrong...!!!\nContinued below... (it turned out into quite a long read and it was not very eye catching so hence the split!)\nSo who is Fast Johnny?! When the world went tumbled into madness and destruction reigned, Johnny who's actual name is Jony Ag Anaba, found himself without his trusty camel Sarah. Sarah got killed as his tribesmen ate her. Johnny was heartbroken and after having trained her from birth he was at loss on what to do. \nEmptiness and bitterness filled his soul and in a fit of rage he murdered his kin and ventured out into the desert. Wandering for weeks on end he almost gave in and was about to take his own life to be with his loved Sarah. \nBut then, as a sign from above he found a giant turtle in need of help. The turtle fell from a sand dune and was lying on its back, unable to get back on its feet. Johnny flipped the turtle over and ever since then, an unbreakable bond was firmly established between the two of them. He named the turtle Sarah in honour of his beloved camel and now they wander the Wasteland that the world has become.\nSlowly, yet steadfast...\nRenders\nHere are the renders that the sculptor, Radmir Achmentov of Punga Miniatures, made. He took our idea and really went for it. You can tell he enjoyed sculpting Fast Johnny and we hope that will be the case for the others we have planned too.\nIn these pics you can see one of the stretch goals we have planned. Sir Teddy was taken as spoils of combat from an encounter with another Wasteland Raider named Zarola. Apparently Fast Johnny shot her mount and took Sir Teddy from her. She's not dead though and is planning revenge as soon as she has found a new mount!\nPrint\nWhen the print came in we found out that there was quite some damage unfortunately and we had to use Green Stuff to fix some cracks and breaks. While a bit rusty I was able to repair them all. The print also suffered from some missing detail that the printer wasn't able to print very well. Mostly on the rifle. I think I managed to fix it properly and it even adds to the character of a post apocalyptic wanderer that has to prepare things with limited resources at hand. \nI also took the liberty to add reins that run from Fast Johhny's hands to the head of the turtle. The sculptor did sculpt them but only held in his hands and to me it looked a bit odd since Sarah has a halter and there was nothing attached to it.   \nCast\nThe casting is done by our anonymous casting benefactor who I call by the codename of Sir Castalot! He has done the casting of the new batch of CP New Skins, CP Yakuza Dragoness and Kumicho as well as the Eldritch Dre'ya the Silent leaf. Needles to say, that to us, he is an absolute legend and he has saved our ass a couple of times! \nHe told us that Fast Johnny casts up like a charm so we foresee no problems there whatsoever!\nFast Johnny front\nFast Johnny side\nFast Johnny other side\nFast Johnny back\nPictures courtesy of Sir Castalot. We didn't recieve the package on time and I didn't want to delay the launch. I'll prep one and do a video of fast Johnny and sarah this weekend.\nSize\nFast Johnny is 54mm scale. From the top of Johnny's head to the bottom of the turtle's shell is roughly 60mm. Including the turtle's legs this will be roughly70/75mm.\nBelow you see the print with a ruler next to it. \nFast Johnny height\nFast Johnny length\nWe only have two types of pledges this time. An Ouroboros Miniatures' first time ever...  48 hour only EARLY BIRD!!! \nYes you've read that right. For the first 48 hours of the campaign you can get Fast Johnny with an additional extra \u20ac5,- off!\nThe standard pledge for a copy of Fast Johnny comes with a discount from the MSRP too of course! \nEARLY BIRD!\nFast Johnny regular pledge!\nWe also have options (normal pledge plus an early bird!) to get two Fast Johnny miniatures with a little more discount. Just in case you are thinking to convert one so Fast Johnny doesn't get too lonely! ;)\nShipping will be charged during the Kickstarter. For all pledges it is \u20ac10,- which includes tracking, signed for delivery and insurance.  \nWe have set the delivery date for February 2019. Casting is almost ready to go and we believe this is a realistic date. \nThe company who handles our shipping proved a couple of times already that they do a good job. We have every faith we can deliver on time as we have become quite good at organizing and packing. We don't think there will be a delay in packages going out to backers but would just like to add that delays can happen. Once the shipping company has your parcels it is out of our control. However we will do everything possible again to fulfill this Kickstarter on time. \nPlease note that we are not responsible for any customs or other fees that might occur. \nMiniatures come unpainted and need assembly and some minor cleaning.\nAs always there are a few people I want to thank! The following people who's help and hard work has made it possible to do this campaign!  \nRadmir Achmentov (Punga Miniatures)\nMally Anderson (Journeyman Miniatures\nMiranda Bosch-Thurlings\nSir Castalot (our mysterious incognito caster who we very grateful for to have on our side! You know who you are and you are a legend mate!!!)\nKyle Cruickshank (Mr Lees Minis)\nLuke Wilson\nOne thing that is very important if you want to help us fund is to please take a moment to share the project. You can do this by sharing the campaign on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Google+, your blog, forums and on any other Social media you might know! Tell your friends who might be interested and with your help we can make this project as successful as possible, ensuring we can make many more wonderful busts and miniatures in the near future!  \nYou can follow us here: \nhttps://www.facebook.com/OuroborosMiniatures/\nhttps://ouroborosminiatures.blogspot.nl/\nhttps://www.instagram.com/ouroborosminiatures/\nhttps://twitter.com/OuroborosMinis\nhttps://plus.google.com/u/0/collection/4nJUNE\nContinued from top...\nDue to severe issues with our then caster, we were only able to unofficially release a bunch of busts and could only release all of them officially last September. Releasing them all at once and in such a short timespan was definitely not ideal as you can imagine but we had no choice really. Our game of playing catch up had started and by now we are almost reaching a point that we are there where we want to be. Why not hold things off to next year you might think? Well to be honest we don't want this year to mess up our plans for next year really! We don't want to look back anymore but move forward! So, coming back to what this text started with, we started the year full of enthusiasm and wanted to go full speed but then did a Fast Johnny! Not going very fast but moving on forwards at a slow yet steady pace. Determined to not give up and continue doing what we do! Thankfully a lot of you like what we are doing and your continuous support has made it possible for us to grow and keep growing. We say it often but we do really appreciate your support!!! So maybe this comparison is not entirely accurate but the story of the turtle and the hare kinda suits here. A fast starter not always ends up first. But a slow starter ends up over the finish line at some point as well! Sorry for turning this into an essay in the end but to some of you it might be interesting to have some insight into things.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nFast Johnny has already been sculpted, moulded and (test) cast.

Each model has been hand sculpted, and is cast in the finest white metal and resin. My goal is to make sure that every single WTFF miniature is packed full of character, is a joy to paint, and will look suitably splendid on your table top.  \nSo grab your popcorn, break out your beverages, and take your seats. Whilst we wait for the match to start, how's about we look at our second team to take to the pitch...\nCast in either white metal or fine resin.\nHuman model is for size comparison only and is owned by Games Workshop\nDifferent team, same quality\nBattle Ball/ WTFF Pitches\nCLICK HERE!\nCLICK HERE!\nWarp Team Fantasy Football have teamed up with Chris from Battle Ball to bring you these awesome Croc Blockers branded vinyl gaming mats! Usable on their own, they can also be placed inside the epic Battle Ball laser cut stadiums, and how awesome do they look?\nTo grab either the mat or the stadium, check out the Battle Ball Kickstarter here! - https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/178326236/battle-ball-field-a-fantasy-football-arena/description\nWhy are there only a few stretch goals?  \nKickstarter is an interesting beast, as all of us know from experience. Countless times people get involved in long, extensive campaigns only to wait months, sometimes years for them to be fulfilled. When the crowd bays for more, it's tempting to give in and offer far more products than you can deliver in the time frame promised at the start of the campaign!  \nIn the past I've ran a few of those types of campaigns, and, as with the Ram Raiders Kickstarter, I have once again decided to keep this short and sweet. This means fewer products for you all to buy, but a much shorter time for you all to wait before your lovely models are on your painting desk. Which we can all agree, is exactly where they ought to be.\nThe cost of shipping is not included in your pledge, and will be added after the conclusion of the campaign through the pledge manager. I will provide you all with full instructions when the time comes. I am still finalising the exact shipping costs, but to give you a rough idea here are a couple of preliminary estimates:  \nGAME DAY TICKET: - \u00a30 unless used to purchase miniatures in the campaign.  \nBOOGIE'S BUY: - \u00a32 to the UK, \u00a34 EU and \u00a34 ROW.  \nTEAM PLAYER/GOLDEN CLAWS: \u00a33.50 to the UK, \u00a37 EU and \u00a37 ROW.  \nThese estimates may increase if you purchase a large number of additional models on top of your core pledge, especially at the BOOGIE'S BUY or GAME DAY TICKET level. The final shipping costs are subject to change, and will be based on your location and specific rewards.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAny undertaking of this nature is a huge commitment and a lot of work for everyone involved. Miniatures need sculpting, manufacturing, packing and eventually shipping to the backers.\n\nIt is at these hurdles that some Kickstarters have faltered in the past, so, I have given careful consideration to each part of the process to minimise potential risk. Warploque Miniatures is a family run business, so everyone involved is 100% dedicated to making this project as successful and professional as possible. My father is our resin caster, my mother is in charge of packing and shipment, and our metal caster is a tried and tested person we have worked with before.\n\nAlso, instead of relying purely on concept art and work-in-progress sculpts to illustrate my products, all of the initial models that I am offering have already been sculpted. They've been cast, the display copies have been painted, and they are ready to go into production, so backers know exactly what they are investing in. I will be relying on Work in Progress sculpts and concept art for some of the stretch goals, but be assured that they will be completed and cast in a timely manner once the campaign has been funded.\n\n\nFinally, I have set achievable delivery date estimates. I have kept the campaign small and manageable, eschewing the long list of stretch goals that other campaigns have had, so this project has a much higher probability of being completed and delivered on time.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a31 or more", "title": "LEVEL 1: GAME DAY TICKET", "descp": "Show your love and support the campaign, even if you don't want any models!

We hope you\u2019ll come along for the ride!\nThe Forest Dragon Bang & Twang is a fast and fun game of keeping up with an ever-changing piece of music, played by a variety of characters on a variety of characterful instruments from the world of The Forest Dragon.\nThe musicians gather at crossroads and campfires across the forest. They produce their instruments, tune up and begin to play! They play tunes both weird and wonderful, with many a twang and bang from their array of amazing musical implements. As the tunes get faster and more complicated, the musicians wrestle to keep up and challenge each others\u2019 musical ability.\nWith amazing art from Rory, Ben, and with just a little help from their dad, games-industry veteran Jon Hodgson, The Forest Dragon Bang & Twang is a fast and exciting game for the whole family!\nThe Forest Dragon centres around 3 special cards. On one side they have \u201cBang\u201d and on the other, they have \u201cTwang\u201d.\nThere\u2019s also a deck of 24 other cards, from which players draw a hand of 2 cards. Players must try to match the sequence shown on those special \u201criff\u201d cards with the cards in their hand. They can flip one of the riff cards, or they can move one of them. If they can match a riff they \"bank\" that card. Or they can play a special card that has special effects. \nA round of play takes around ten minutes, and play moves around the table nice and fast!\n\nWe\u2019ve made the game so there\u2019s almost always something to do on your turn, so no one gets left out. And for younger players, you can just play along and have an enjoyable time. For older players though, there\u2019s a lot more strategy - remembering who has \u201cbanked\u201d what card, and deciding which of the possible moves is the best one on your turn adds a lot more depth.\nThere are 8 special cards in the Bang & Twang deck, and these cards form \u201cthe tune\u201d. If you want to change the tune for the next game, you can take out those 8 special cards, and replace them with a different set! This makes gameplay really varied!\nBang & Twang features 6 sets of special cards - 6 \u201ctunes\u201d, and totals 67 cards in the box!\nYou can download a print and play version of Bang & Twang right now! It doesn\u2019t have art - we\u2019ve kept it very simple for home printing, but you can try out the first \u201ctune\u201d, absolutely free! Download it here: https://www.dropbox.com/\nIn 2016 we Kickstarted our first game together. The Forest Dragon by Rory Age 9 proved to be a huge success. We raised way more support than we expected, and doubled the size of the game through the campaign! It was an amazing ride!\nThe Forest Dragon was created by Rory when he was 7. He\u2019d been thinking about games, and described the whole thing in pretty much one breath. We wrote it down and slowly over a couple of years turned it into a playable game. And with your help on Kickstarter we made it into a reality. You can buy our first game in selected stores and on line.\nClearly, this isn't really just about making another game. I want my kids, Rory and Ben to continue to learn about hard work, games design, probability, art, layout, writing rules, product design, costings and all kinds of things that are good to learn about. \nMaking a game with them has been a way to show them a creative path, and how the whole world around them is someone's idea put into practice. With this second game, we\u2019re learning about sticking with something, persistence, and all the trials and pitfalls of making that second game. Can we do it? We think so!\nI really want to show the boys the reality of how games get made, and all the different processes involved. With Bang & Twang, we\u2019re learning about what it means to make an \u201cintellectual property\u201d and how we approach a line of games, rather than just one game. \nOur first game was made with print on demand technology that let us order one game for each person that backed us. This time we\u2019d like to try to go one further and make a full print run of the game, and get it deeper into more shops around the world! If we fund, it means we\u2019ll make the game through print on demand once again. And we\u2019ll be very happy with that. But if we can reach some of our stretch goals, we\u2019ll be able to make a more fancy box, and do a whole print run, which will be a big learn for the boys! (Dad has made many such boxed games in his day job, so you\u2019re in safe hands!)\nTo help build towards our goal we had some great Add-Ons. These are extra things you can pledge for. If you decide you\u2019d like an Add-On, then up your pledge by the appropriate amount. You can pledge for them before they are unlocked if you wish - that will help them get unlocked.\n\nIf we do manage to unlock some of these Add-Ons we\u2019ll make some new pledge levels that include them too, for your convenience.\n\nAll prices include shipping.\nBang & Twang Badge Set Add \u00a35 to your pledge\nYou\u2019ll get a cool selection of exclusive Forest Dragon goodies! 4 Forest Dragon badges, a cool round sticker, and a square fridge magnet!\n\nThe Forest Dragon By Rory Add \u00a317 to your pledge\nThis is the game that started it all. The price includes shipping.\nThe Forest Dragon Expansion Box Add \u00a317 to your pledge\n A selection of amazing expansions to the original Forest Dragon game! Includes The Poo Cave, Dogs and Stuff, Robo Realm, Fire Dragon Realm, Quest Givers!\n\nOriginal Game Double Up! Add \u00a330 to your pledge\nBoth the original Forest Dragon by Rory game AND the Expansion Box\nBang & Twang Play Mat LOCKED Add \u00a312 to your pledge\nCurrently locked, but with enough backers, it\u2019ll become available! A neoprene play mat that makes a lovely space to hold the riff cards and the draw deck. It\u2019s 13 inches square making it large enough to use the coasters on too! It\u2019s like a mouse mat but bigger and cooler!\nBang & Twang Coasters Add \u00a35 to your pledge\nAVAILABLE NOW! These are adorable! Replace the Riff cards you get in your Bang & Twang Box with a set of 3 Bang & Twang Coasters! \nBang & Twang Coins Add \u00a312 to your pledge\nAVAILABLE NOW! The Bang & Twang coins are something very special - a strictly limited edition set of real metal coins, with gorgeous enamel colours - green on one side, orange on the other. Made by the coin experts at Campaign Coins these are really amazing. They come in a set of three, and are perfect to replace the riff cards in the Bang & Twang box for the fanciest game imaginable!\nBurp & Fart LOCKED Add \u00a315 to your pledge\nCurrently locked, but with enough backers, it\u2019ll become available! This is basically disgusting. One of our playtesters who is old enough to know better suggested the whole game could be re-skinned as \u201cBurp & Fart\u201d. This will feature the adorable \u201cGreedy Boys\u201d characters sat in a ditch, holding a burping and farting contest. If we unlock this stretch goal we\u2019ll make a whole new base game available as an Add-On. It will have the same rules, but all new, deeply ill-mannered card art. \nWARNING: Will contain pictures of burps and farts drawn by giddy children.\nMany of our fans are friends and family who don't know much about Kickstarter. Thanks for making it this far! We love you!\nKickstarter is a website that allows project creators with an idea to pitch that idea to the audience of the Internet. There's usually a product at the heart of a Kickstarter campaign. In this case, it's the Bang & Twang game. \nIf people like the idea they can pledge money to the project. If enough money is pledged in order to meet the campaign's funding goal by the end, the money is collected from your card by Kickstarter, they take a cut, and the rest is passed on to the creator. And the project is made a reality. If we don\u2019t raise enough pledges no one gets charged. And we go away to think very hard about what we did wrong. \nTo encourage and thank supporters, or \"backers\" as they are known, we are offering a range of Rewards and Add-Ons. These start out at the game itself, and you can get more stuff like artwork, your own expansions and more!\nAnother encouragement to spread the word and convince others to join in, are Stretch Goals. These are milestones which unlock extra rewards. Sometimes they allow backers to buy something new, by upping their pledge. Other times they add something to existing rewards for free. \n\nThroughout the period of the campaign, you can amend your pledge up and down as you see fit. Only once the campaign ends is the amount you pay locked in. So it pays to keep an eye on progress, and pledge for everything you'd like!\nIf you have any questions at all, please drop me (Jon) a line via PM, email, text or whatever method suits you best, and I\u2019ll do my best to explain how to back us! Don\u2019t be shy, we understand that Kickstarter can be daunting if you\u2019ve never used it.\nTo pledge to our campaign you need to hit the Pledge button. You'll sign up to an account, decide how much you'd like to pledge, select what kind of reward you'd like - you can choose to just give to the campaign out of kindness, or you can select what you'd like to receive for your support. We'd love you to have a copy of the game.\nYou can throw in whatever you like above the basic pledge levels - there aren't fixed amounts you have to give.\nYou'll provide some payment details and, if enough people chose to support us, at the end of the campaign your card will be charged. The project creators get in touch a short time after that to collect any additional information they might need.\nFollowing a Kickstarter campaign is a lot of fun. A community of supporters is created, who can all share their excitement and support in the comments section, as well as ask questions or make requests of the project. You'll also receive updates throughout the campaign either here or by email.\nFor our second campaign we\u2019re playing it very safe - the whole of the base game is done. 5 additional Expansions are completely made. With children helping to make the core reward we needed to know they'd be able to finish the project. And they have. We just need money for printing and shipping it to you. We are not spending any time after the campaign on further development, testing or art for the core game. It\u2019s done. This does mean we won\u2019t go much beyond 5 additional expansions, but we feel that\u2019s the best and most honest way to do things. We have not yet completed work on the art and graphics for \u201cBurp & Fart\u201d but should we be lucky enough to unlock that stretch goal we\u2019ll get it done as soon as possible! It won\u2019t take long.\nStretch goals are each unlocked as we reach their milestone in our funding level. If we\u2019re lucky we\u2019ll reveal more as the campaign progresses!\n\u00a31500 This is our basic goal. At this level, we\u2019ll make a print on demand version of the game in a nice tuck box and send it to you with our thanks. \nWe\u2019ll reveal more stretch goals if we do well!\nPraise for the Forest Dragon by Rory Age 9\nDon\u2019t just take our word for it, here are some thoughts about our first game, The Forest Dragon by Rory Age 9: \n\"The Forest Dragon is a precious thing, an experience Jon Hodgson and his son Rory will treasure for years to come. And it\u2019s a fine game to boot! We\u2019re so lucky they decided to share it with us.\" - Francesco Nepitello, game designer\n\u201cThe Forest Dragon is as indispensable as wet wipes and snacks, and occupies a permanent place in my 'leaving the house with the kids' bag.\u201d - Gareth Ryder Hanrahan, author, game designer \n\"If you\u2019ve ever experienced wonder while wandering and exploring, the Forest Dragon contains that excitement in a conveniently-carried, child-friendly card game.\" - Jacob Rodgers, game designer\n\u201cIt's very easy to pick up and play the game, with enough depth in the game to keep kids of all ages entertained. At its heart, there's a marvelous whimsical adventure, which had my pair (an 8 and 11-year-old) coming back for more. I knew I was onto a winner when they were picking up the cards and having games without me :) \u201d - Newt Newport, game designer\n\u201cThe most nutritious cardgame I have ever eaten!\u201d - Patric G\u00f6tz, game publisher \n\"Our Forest Dragon card game has (literally) been to the base of Mount Doom and to Hobbiton, entertained plenty of adults and children along the trek and is an absolute joy to play.\" - Scott Purdy, artist\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a good game because it was written by a kid; it\u2019s a good game because it\u2019s a good game.\u201d - Jared Earle, writer, photographer\n\u201cIt's an awesome game which my kids love playing! Especially when they beat me at it!\u201d - Gordon Kennedy, game artist\n\n\"With its bright colors, fun illustrations, and easy rules, The Forest Dragon became a fast favorite in our house. It is quick enough to learn to hold my children's attention and fun enough to appeal to adults as well.\" - August Hahn, game designer\n\n\"This game is amazing. I like stealing items from my family, especially my brother. We usually play with the whole pack to make the game really long and exciting, and my favourite bit is the Poo Portal!\" - Milla aged 7.\n\"Both enchanting and hilarious, this simple-but-fun card game is already a favourite in our house. The artwork is delightful. The Poo Cave Expansion is essential. We've played it with small people and with my eighty-year-old parents. It's a winner with everyone. Gutted we missed out on Clarinetto.\" - Claire Longhurst, gamer\n\n\"So good I wrote a review of it\"  - Pookie, game reviewer\n\n\"It\u2019s funny and my wife likes it\" - Adam Littlefield, musician\n\n\"I\u2019ve so far only played it with adults, but they all loved it (and it wasn\u2019t too complicated for them) \ud83d\ude42\" Andrew Peregrine, game designer\n\n\"Fantastic game. My kids have racked up over 200 hours playing this game. A family favourite that never get old! Highly recommended.\" - Wayne McNamara, gamer\n\n\"Such a simple game and great fun to play. That said, I\u2019ve yet to win a game against my eight year old and his friends!\" -Tom Cusworth, gamer\n\"The Forest Dragon is a great game. Attractive to look at, simple enough to play as soon as the box is open, but with enough variety to repay any number of repeat plays. And the monsters are very cool.\" - Matt Cambridge, writer", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe\u2019ve successfully made our first game and delivered it to people all around the world. \n\nWe're keeping things very simple.

We hope we've done our sums right.\n\nWhere we print the game will depend on how well we do. If we fund at a lower level it will be printed in the UK.

Goregasm Arena pits the hardiest denizens of the nuclear wastelands in brutal gladiatorial combat. Strike, shunt, and tackle the competition into submission, asserting your dominance of the alter square in this fast and brutal game. Wrestle for the adoration of the crowd by stomping your opponents into a bloody pulp and reap the rewards (or lament the disastrous consequences) when you spin the wheel. Will you claim the glory in the arena?\nPlayers take it in turns to control miniature combatants, spending adrenaline to perform actions such as strikes, shunts, and tackles in an attempt to gain glory points and whittle down their opponents meat points. Adrenaline only regenerates slowly, so players must be careful not to be caught out after an epic bout of athletic prowess! \nScream with delight while your foes squeal with pain as they draw awfully brutal injury cards as a result of your critical strikes!\nCombatants will inevitably be called to face the crowd with the wheel, where the unpredictable nature of their fans comes to life with fantastic bonuses or treacherous hazards.    \nEach box of Goregasm arena comes with the following:\nThe Miniatures - 35mm scale cast in high quality Resin. Supplied unpainted.\n 4 Combatant miniatures and 4 Totems, cast in gorgeous high quality resin.

Zealot is back with our third Kickstarter, bringing to life this new range, with our usual reputation for quality and jaw-droppingly detailed miniatures.\nBack in 2014 we created a new level of Dungeon scenery, using digital production methods and detailed vacuum casting. Then last year, we breathed new life into a too-long forgotten fantasy race, the Minotaurs, which we are finishing the delivery of now - with delighted backers praising the detail and quality.\nThis time, we wanted to go back to our roots and tackle real heroes and villains, characters which capture our imaginations and make us remember why we started gaming or collecting.\nWe are heavily inspired by classic RPG games; playing old fantasy games from the 80s is what started all this madness in the first place!\nSo welcome to a fusion of past and present, new and old. We are updating, modernizing and offering to you, this range of high quality miniatures traditionally sculpted by the awesome miniature artist, Boris Woloszyn.\nIf you like what you see; Read on, brave adventurer.\n We don't produce board game counters, these are not PVC pencil toppers, injection moulded in china  - we make Miniatures. Resin and Metal, these are produced the same as they were 30 years ago, cutting no corners and not skimping on quality or detail. It's not the fastest or cheapest process, but it certainly is the best. If you want Miniatures which you will cherish and still want to use in another 30 years time, then these are for you.\n We have teamed up with Boris Woloszyn, a traditional putty sculptor from Brazil, these models are made by hand, no 3D printing involved (unusually for us!). Boris has a real talent as an artist, able to bring true character to each sculpt, I'm sure you will agree.\nThese models are heavily inspired by the classic games we grew up loving and playing with our families and friends. Just take a look at the greens, all made from putty.\nProduction of Boris's sculpts is done in three materials, Standard Resin, White Metal and Premium Resin. As we unlock each material in the stretch goals, you will have a choice to add which material you want.\nStandard Resin is one for the gamer, it is on par with a lot of other companies' resin materials, the details are good but the resin is not as tough and flexible as the Premium offering. There will be more splits and parts for each model when they are produced in this material.\nWhite Metal, that fabled shiny material which is fondly remembered by older gamers. When your army weighed more than a cinder block and dropping a Dragon model on your toes resulted in a trip to the hospital.\nIt's for the gamer or painter who wants a shot of nostalgia, feeling the weight in their hands. The details are good, the models are tough and it paints well. White metal does have more gates and vents to clean up from the model than resin models.\nPremium Resin is really a superior resin. It requires very few gates and vents, has a nice matte surface to paint, has 0.2% shrinkage and captures every detail of the original sculpt perfectly. It is tougher than Standard Resin with some flex to avoid damage. It cuts and files well when cleaning the model up or converting.\nPremium resin is the material for the serious painter or collector.\n All of the pledges you can supplement with \"Add Ons\" from the section below.\nMiniatures come in three tiers 'Hero Sized', 'Mighty Sized' and 'Monstrous Sized'. Green, Blue and Yellow Dots respectively.\nScenery by our friends at Manor House Workshop, Forgotten Halls\nYou can add to your pledge with any of the following packs. Just increase your pledge by the amount needed.\nTo see each scenery piece in better detail, you can view them in our store by clicking here.\nHere is a gallery for each of the core Miniatures, stretch goal models can bee seen in the section below. The coloured dot on each image, indicates if they are \"Hero Sized\", \"Mighty Sized\" or \"Monstrous Sized\".\nEach model will come with a standard Plastic Round Base or Classic Rectangle base, as shown in the pictures. You can make your selection on the Pledge Manager after the campaign closes.\nScenery by our friends at Manor House Workshop, 3DBases\n As funding progresses we will unlock stretch goals and extra miniatures. Below you can see what has been unlocked and what is the next goal coming up. The coloured dot on each image refers to the size. Green \"Hero Size\", Blue \"Mighty Size\" and Orange \"Monstrous Size\".\nWe are splitting the production into three tiers with the three types of material on offer. This should allow us to deliver to our deadlines as the load on each manufacturing method is reduced. Currently we have marked July 2019 as the delivery for this project. \nSince this is a traditionally sculpted project, Boris requires around 1 week to complete each additional sculpt, depending on how many stretch goals are unlocked, this could take a fair few months for him to complete the sculpting. You cant rush this kind of art!\nIf this is the case and we hit a lot of the planned stretch goals, we are happy to offer a split dispatch option, where the core models are dispatched early - since they are already in moulds and not far off mass production. There will be no problem delivering core models before the dispatch date.\nThen the stretch goal sculpts will follow some months later in wave 2.\nDue to the manufacture method of vacuum cast resin and spincast metals, dispatch date will depend a lot on amount that we fund. We will update this section once funding is underway and we have a better idea for how popular this will be. We do dispatch on a rolling backer ID system.\nIt may be possible to dispatch Standard Resin core miniatures ahead of the predicted delivery date.\nScenery by our friends at Manor House Workshop, 3DBases\nMAXIMUM Postage Costs\nThese are the MAXIMUM postage costs for a large pledge. For example a pledge of 50 models in White metal would be these values. 50 models in resin, the postage is around half these values.\nPostage costs start at the values which are stated on each pledge (\u00a33 UK, \u00a34 EU and \u00a35 Rest of World) If you add more models and Add ons, postage costs will increase with weight. The end postage will be calculated by the pledge manager after the campaign end.\nPlease note, metal models are around 4 times as heavy as resin.\nThe end postage costs will be calculated on the Pledge Manager, but they will not exceed the postage values in the table below. These include tracked and signed for shipping.\nBy Adam Skinner", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe will produce a new range of quality resin and metal Heroes and Monsters. The risks to this project are very minimal. We do this kind of production, every day for 8 years, producing miniatures for many high profile companies. All the core set of models are already ready to start mass manufacture. \n\nWe are not new to Kickstarter; our first Kickstarter was a colossal project ~200k resin cast pieces.\nWe delivered it and it was highly praised that \"the quality was beyond amazing\" and the detail was \"phenomenal\". Certainly achieving what we set out; to bring a new level of cutting edge dungeon scenery to gamers.\nOur second project, the Minotaur Horde, we are on track to deliver the last few hundred backers inside the next 2 months, and again the feedback was overwhelmingly positive by everyone receiving their pledge. \n\nRisk#1: Speed of manufacture.\nResin and Spincast Metal are labor intensive materials to cast with. If there are many stretch goals which we hit, then Boris will need more time to sculpt them. This will push back the start of manufacture. \n\nWhile there will be no problem delivering the core models by the estimated date. If the project funds well and many goals are hit - then we will offer a split shipping option, so core models are delivered on time, then stretch goal models get delivered in a wave 2 a few months later. \n\nAside from the risk of delayed dispatch of stretch goals, the risks are very minimal.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a31 or more", "title": "+ MANNA SHARER +", "descp": "A big thank you from the Twisting Catacombs backers, Zealot Miniatures and the RPG gamer community for helping us to create some awesome miniatures.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2018"}], "stat": ["39 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a35 or more", "title": "+ SOLO HERO +", "descp": "One Hero-Sized Miniature of your choice, in Standard Resin.\nUpgrading material to White Metal or Premium Resin is an addition.\nHero-Sized Models are marked with a Green Dot.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jul 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["131 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a318 or more", "title": "+ ADVENTURE PARTY +", "descp": "Four Hero-Sized Miniature of your choice, in Standard Resin.\nUpgrading material to White Metal or Premium Resin is an addition.\nHero-Sized Models are marked with a Green Dot.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jul 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["334 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a362 or more", "title": "+ COLLECTOR +", "descp": "One of all the 13 models in the Core Kickstarter, in Standard Resin.

Also for JUST $40.00 USD.\n     See? Not much math stuff, lots of Orcs and Goblins. Who needs them book learnin talkie times anyways? Not Gobbers and Orcsies don't.\n     It is our hope that as the campaign progresses we can add items to the offering and perhaps to the initial box contents as well HOWEVER as this is our first effort in plastic manufacturing we want to be sure we are responsible and take this slowly keeping everything nice and predictable and efficiently produced and delivered. So there will only be a few additions to this campaigns. We don't want to get too ahead of ourselves with promises but we also want to make sure we make the most of this campaign that we can. You CAN NOT go wrong with more and more monstrous beasties eh?\n\n    Please be aware you can buy as many of these boxes as you want! Personally I don't think any orc or goblin warband is complete unless it nearly breaks the shelves under it's ponderous weight when stowed away between sessions of rampaging blood thirst. \n   If you want to add to your rewards you can do so by managing the amount of your pledge upward by enough to cover the addition of as many green hellions your heart desires. \n  And remember a forest without goblins under every hedge is just not a forest worth trodding through for any self respecting adventurer!

They DESERVE awesome enemies to fight! the theatre of your imagination DESERVES fantastic minis! YOU. NEED. THE HORDES OF THE AULD WORLD ORCS AND GOBLINS BOXED SET!!\n   The whole idea of this kickstarter is to fund the production of these fantastic monstrosities in high detail hard grade PVC plastic similar to many of the newly beloved board games recently hitting the market like a spiked ball of steel in the gnarly green fist of a feral Orc berserker rampaging through the ranks of silly tights wearing doods who spend all their time preening their poofy feathered hats and shining their armor and dancing with their little swishy poke \" swords \" and singing songs about damsels and wine and stupid stuff. Do we really want those kinds of doods in charge of stuff and ruining our good time? No. No we do not. We want Orcs and goblins. Lots of them. That is why plastic is good; cause we can make a LOT of them and sell them cheap.\n\n  So to help us do this well we need your help to allow us to pay the high cost of plastic production with tried and true manufacturers who have produced many of these exact same great boxed game projects.\n   Ok this is serious. Shipping is important and can be costly depending upon where in the world you need your stuff to be delivered to. Because we do not know exactly when the project will complete production we cannot bill for postage until the product is actually in hand and ready to deliver. We are working to build a base frame of reference for the shipping costs and we are also working to establish relationships that may allow us to ship from hubs in various parts of the world to mitigate those costs. \n   We will work to keep the postage costs as low as possible cause we don't really want to make money from shipping we just want to get your stuff to you as soon as possible cause once you know you have orcs and goblins on the way.... well they just need to get there fast and cheap right? \n   For now though the only region in which we can reasonably project postage costs is the US. We will be shipping orders via priority mail so as long as your stuff fits into a priority box ( and we will be working to make sure that they do ) you can expect to pay the priority mail shipping rates.\nAnd Say!

Each model has been hand sculpted, and is cast in the finest white metal and resin. My goal is to make sure that every single WTFF miniature is packed full of character, is a joy to paint, and will look suitably splendid on your table top.\nSo grab your popcorn, break out your beverages, and take your seats. Whilst we wait for the match to start, how's about we look at our first plucky team to take to the pitch...\nCast in Metal (TEAM PLAYER) or Fine Resin (GOLDEN BOOTS)\nAdd any of the miniatures in the Team to your pledge\nHuman model is for size comparison only and is owned by Games Workshop\n Ram Raiders review by The Wargamer Viking\n Why are there only a few stretch goals?  \nKickstarter is an interesting beast, as all of us know from experience. Countless times people get involved in long, extensive campaigns only to wait months, sometimes years for them to be fulfilled. When the crowd bays for more, it's tempting to give in and offer far more products than you can deliver in the time frame promised at the start of the campaign!\nIn the past I've ran a few of those types of campaigns, and this time I have decided to keep it short and sweet. This means fewer products for you all to buy, but a much shorter time for you all to wait before your lovely models are on your painting desk. Which we can all agree, is exactly where they ought to be.\nKickstarter Launch Hangout!\nThe cost of shipping is not included in your pledge, and will be added after the conclusion of the campaign through the pledge manager. I will provide you all with full instructions when the time comes.  \nI am still finalising the exact shipping costs, but to give you a rough idea here are a couple of preliminary estimates:\nGAME DAY TICKET: - \u00a30 unless used to purchase miniatures in the campaign.\nMICKEY'S PICK: - \u00a32 to the UK, \u00a34 EU and \u00a34 ROW.  \nTEAM PLAYER/GOLDEN BOOTS: \u00a33.50 to the UK, \u00a37 EU and \u00a37 ROW.  \nThese estimates may increase if you purchase a large number of additional models on top of your core pledge, especially at the MICKEY'S PICK or DAY TICKET level.\nThe final shipping costs are subject to change, and will be based on your location and specific rewards.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAny undertaking of this nature is a huge commitment and a lot of work for everyone involved. Miniatures need sculpting, manufacturing, packing and eventually shipping to the backers.\n\nIt is at these hurdles that some Kickstarters have faltered in the past, so, I have given careful consideration to each part of the process to minimise potential risk. Warploque Miniatures is a family run business, so everyone involved is 100% dedicated to making this project as successful and professional as possible. My father is our resin caster, my mother is in charge of packing and shipment, and our metal caster is a tried and tested person we have worked with before.\n\nAlso, instead of relying purely on concept art and work-in-progress sculpts to illustrate my products, all of the initial models that I am offering have already been sculpted. They've been cast, the display copies have been painted, and they are ready to go into production, so backers know exactly what they are investing in.\n\nTo ensure the campaign runs smoothly I will be working on it full-time, and will ensure that all your questions will be answered and updates will posted at all hours.\n\nFinally, I have set achievable delivery date estimates. I have kept the campaign small and manageable, eschewing the long list of stretch goals that other campaigns have had, so this project has a much higher probability of being completed and delivered on time.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a31 or more", "title": "LEVEL 1: GAME DAY TICKET", "descp": "Show your love and support the campaign, even if you don't want any models!

Now, picture yourself as a young American scientist; Hans Tannhauser. Yes, that\u2019s your name in this scenario. While you\u2019re at it, think of Tr\u00fcberbrook, a remote village in rural, mountain-sloped and densely forested cold-war Germany. Because, that\u2019s where you somehow end up after hitting the continent. But who cares, you won the trip in a lottery! Or at least, that\u2019s how it seems. But don\u2019t fear, instead of getting some rest, you could find yourself having to save the world \u2026\nAttention: All of our sceneries are hand-crafted!\n  Suspense! Mystery! Thrills! After all, it's a single player sci-fi mystery adventure game. We want to keep you entertained!\nJoin American student Tannhauser, stranger in a strange land\nSet in cold-war rural Germany in the late 1960s\nInspired by Twin Peaks, The X-Files, Stranger Things & Star Trek\nIndulge in universal themes such as love, friendship, loyalty, self-discovery and dinosaurs\nHandmade miniature scenery!\nEnglish and German localization with full voice acting!\nAtmospheric, moody soundtrack\nComing to Windows, Mac, Linux, Xbox One, PlayStation\u00ae4 & Nintendo Switch\nA likely mobile port later!\nUp to 10 hours of super exciting gameplay!\nRelease scheduled for late 2018 \u2013 not the longest wait!\n     The year is 1967. The world policy is dominated by the Cold War and Vietnam, Russia and America are racing to the moon. At the same time in Europe, students take to the streets from Paris to Berlin.\nOn a larger scale, the world is locked in turmoil, but most people are unaware of the events unfolding in an overlooked, sleepy part in the German province. Hans Tannhauser, an American student in his late twenties is caught by surprise: Out of the blue, he wins a trip to a small, German village, Tr\u00fcberbrook. Truber-what? No idea! It doesn\u2019t help he can\u2019t remember taking part in any lottery in the first place \u2026 Happy to put some distance between him and his Ph.D. in quantum physics, he makes his way to Tr\u00fcberbrook, Germany, bursting with curiosity.\nBut shortly after his arrival, inexplicable things start to happen: A mysterious stranger breaks into his room at the Guesthouse Waldeslust and steals a paper on physics. But who would do that? And why?\nGradually, he gets to know the various villagers and spa guests, one more peculiar than the other. Only young anthropologist Gretchen Lemke, who is on a research trip to Tr\u00fcberbrook, seems normal to him. Before he knows it, Gretchen becomes Tannhauser\u2019s accomplice on the adventure of a lifetime! It slowly dawns on the aspiring physicist that his presence in T\u00fcberbrook is not accidental \u2013 he is here to save the world!\nAs the story proceeds, Tannhauser teams up with Gretchen Lemke, a student of paleoanthropology, and bumps into the enigmatic inventor Lazarus Taft.\nThe ensemble (more detailed sketches down below)\n  Tannhauser is an American physics student in his mid-twenties \u2013 and a clever one at that. The adorable little fellow is well-read, always curious and of a deeply friendly nature.\n Tannhauser is played by Justin Beard:\nGretchen Lemke was always the fiercest kid in the sandbox; cute but merciless if someone dared interrupting her excavations of twig bones and toy artefacts. The somewhat overenthusiastic student of paleoanthropology arrives in Tr\u00fcberbrook on an adventure to unravel the mysteries surrounding the village.\nGretchen Lemke is played by Nora Tschirner:\nAs much a reclusive inventor as it gets, Lazarus Taft quickly became talk of the town due to his superior card playing. There must be a reason he bought this costly old mansion in Tr\u00fcberbrook, of all places \u2026 What's up with Lazarus Taft?\nLazarus Taft is played by Dirk von Lowtzow:\nTr\u00fcberbrook is full of quirky villagers, tourists and strangers \u2013 like the gruffy but warm-hearted innkeeper Trude or her daughter Leni, \"the weird kid\" from Tr\u00fcberbrook Elementary. And there's the old baron, a veteran of two world wars, or Lessing, the prototype of modern day conspiracists. And of course Tr\u00fcbi, the legendary lake monster. To name a few.\nOne of the most distinctive features of the game is the unique visual style. The sceneries are purely handmade. 'Handmade' as in: 'Manufactured using real hands!' And fingers!\nNot the most efficient way of doing things, but certainly the most inefficient one. We're loving it, though! Look at what we do here, piece by piece, by the sweat of our brows. Every little detail is custom-made.\nThe models are digitized using a technique called photogrammetry and later retopologized. This way we get highly detailed polygon models that blend perfectly with our digital characters.\nIt is a lot of work, but also quite exciting! You may ask yourself, how can they reach this level of detail? Are there very tiny people involved? They can't accomplish all of this with mere human hands, right? Well yes, we can! The answer might be our abundance of professional hands. Twenty-four seven at our disposal in all shapes and colors, they get things done!\nWeather effects, using real lights\nEvery scene gets an individual treatment and is staged with actual physical lighting. This allows us to simulate different hours of the day or weather conditions. Even a change of seasons is possible just by redecorating the set with real tiny little snowflakes, no joke.\nDifferent hours of the day\nThis way we achieve an exceptional and magical look that visually reflects the world of Tr\u00fcberbrook.\nTechnical breakdown of a scene\n  Collective childhood hero Ron Gilbert inspecting our models while on promotion for \"Thimbleweed Park\"\n      Tr\u00fcberbrook is a story-driven adventure game with a strong focus on characters and the narrative, but includes a lot of puzzles that need to be solved to progress the story. The puzzles are designed to integrate into the narrative.\nInteraction with the environment\nYou navigate Tannhauser through the different sceneries from a third person perspective, usually in long distance shots to intensify the impression of peeking into a little diorama. The story unfolds as you interact with your environment, talk to other characters and solve puzzles. These range from inventory-based puzzles to social challenges (such as persuading other characters) up to passing unsettling psycho tests.\nExtensive dialogue trees\nFor the console versions, we came up with a very intuitive controller input, allowing you to move the line of sight and walking directions independently. For the PC versions, you can choose between classic point and click mouse controls, and the controller navigation. \n  The soundtrack of Tr\u00fcberbrook is an original composition to fit the mood of the game \u2013 sort of a tranquil \"doom jazz\". Inspirations come from the works of Tom Waits, Angelo Badalamenti, Mark Lanegan, Timber Timbre or Bohren & der Club of Gore.\nThe soundtrack has a playtime of around 40 minutes and is directed by Sebastian Nagel & Albrecht Schrader. Why not listen to the serene main theme while browsing the project?\n\u2013\u2013 Please note that there's an additional fee for shipping and packaging on all the physical rewards. It will be applied on checkout and depends on your country. \u2013\u2013\nWe prepared some nice rewards for your support. Here are some details:\nRegular Digital Version: The regular digital version of the game comes for Windows, Mac and Linux (all DRM-free or via Steam, your choice) and for PlayStation\u00ae4, Xbox One or Nintendo Switch (all via their respective stores). If the game is successfully funded, we'll contact you so you can tell us which version you'd prefer. You can also add additional copies (for a friend or for another system) to your reward by adding 25\u20ac (or $29) to your pledge.\nEarly Access Version: The early access version of the game comes for Windows, Mac and Linux. Enjoy the game while there are no walkthroughs and letsplays around \u2013 unless you create them yourselves, which we'd like to encourage! For organizational reasons, this version is limited and will be distributed via Steam. It will be ready around ten days before the regular release!\nPC Boxed Version: This boxed version is exclusive to Kickstarter and includes a physical disc to install the game DRM-free on your Windows, Mac or Linux system. Also comes with an additional Steam Key and includes some really nice haptic goodies, such as a manual and stuff. You can add additional boxes to your reward by adding 75\u20ac (or $87) to your pledge, packaging and shipping included.\nPS4 Boxed Version: New! This boxed version is exclusive to Kickstarter and includes a PS4 version of the game. Comes with some really nice haptic goodies, such as a manual and stuff. You can add additional boxes to your reward by adding 75\u20ac (or $87) to your pledge, packaging and shipping included.\nArt Book: The art book is one of our favourite rewards, since, you know, we have tons of artwork, sketches and behind-the-scenes material to share with you! The digital version will be available as a DRM-free download. It is included in the digital plus edition and all higher tiers or can be added to a lower tier by adding 12\u20ac (or $14) to your pledge! The really neat printed version is a Kickstarter exclusive item and rather expensive to produce. Every copy will be numbered continuously and signed by the team. You can add more printed art books by raising your pledge by 59\u20ac (or $69).\nDigital Wallpapers: The lower tiers include one random (1 out of 5) digital wallpaper in a 5k resolution. The whole set of 5 digital wallpapers is included in the digital plus edition and all higher tiers. Can also be added to lower tiers by raising your pledge by 6\u20ac (or $7).\nDigital Soundtrack: The digital soundtrack is included in the digital plus edition and all higher tiers. It will be available as a DRM-free download. You can also add it to lower tiers by adding 15\u20ac (or $18) to your pledge!\nYour name in the credits: We would be happy to put your real name into the credits. Of course you can also provide us with a pseudonym.*\nYour name featured in the game: The higher tiers include the really cool opportunity to immortalize your name in the genetic code of the game. Could be in the hotel's guestbook, a book title in the library or in the patient manifesto of the sanatorium ... There will be different prominent spots throughout the game for you to leave your name! *\nYour Portrait: As in every decent guesthouse, there's a small ancestral gallery of regular visitors (\"Stammg\u00e4ste\") at the Waldeslust. We have reserved a unique spot for the most willing backers, awaiting your portrait to join in! Our character artist Benny will draw your likeness in the style of the game \u2013 or at least he will try to! For that, he will need some photos provided by you to meet your appearence. Take a look at our own team portraits below to get the idea! As a bonus feature, there will be a short biographical note* included for these sparkling personalities, of course commented by the main character.\n* Please keep in mind that every submission or pseudonym needs to meet community standards: no racist, sexist or otherwise offensive pseudonyms and submissions will be accepted, also no copyright infringing material. We reserve the right to reject a submission for any reason. Thank you for your understanding!\nPersonal Studio Tour: A personal studio tour of our facilities in Cologne, Germany. Visit our legendary main base \"Studio K\u00f6nig\", probably the only professional and fully functional TV studio made up from scratch and screwed together by a bunch of art students. Here we create our weekly late night show \"Neo Magazin Royale\" as well as \"Schulz & B\u00f6hmermann\". The tour is guided by the developers of the game and includes an exhibition of the miniature sceneries used in the game. To make the most of it, we suggest a visit on a weekday, so you can get to know all of our collegues in the wild! We are somewhat flexible regarding the date and will contact you on the details once the Kickstarter is over. Attention: travel expenses and accomodation are not included.\nOur main base \"Studio K\u00f6nig\" \u2013 famous for the lavish Hoppenbrock mural and the impressive triceratops gargoyle on it's roof\nOriginal Set Piece: We have tons of tiny little set pieces used in the making of the actual game. Each and every piece was created individually and received a lot of work, time and love from our set designers. We'll make sure to let you choose between a variety of original set pieces once the campaign is over. Don't worry, there's certainly enough for everyone!\nUnique Scenery Scale Model: Our scenery models come in different shapes and sizes \u2013 some are reaaally big, like an ankylosaurus, while others are rather small, like a hesperonychus. We are ready to give away one of our smaller models (as the big ones would be far to heavy to transport). Let's be honest here: it will probably break our hearts to see the little ones go. But from the day we brought them into life, we always knew they would want to leave the house one day, become independent, travel the world. So it's cool, really. (We can always make new ones.)\nIf you'd like to add a specific reward to your selected tier, just add the corresponding amount of money (see list for prices) to your pledge. We'll then check the difference between your selected tier and the actual pledged money and get back to you after the Kickstarter to clarify which rewards you wished to include. Feel free to message us or ask in the comments if you have any questions!\n  We'll release the game for Windows, Mac, Linux, Xbox One, PlayStation\u00ae4 & Nintendo Switch.\nMobile: Right now we cannot promise mobile versions for Android and iOS, but we think the game would be much fun on tablet computers and mobile phones. We would love to do these after the initial release, as the development would certainly take some extra time due to different technical challenges and performance reasons.\n  We've spent a lot of time working on a voice acting concept that joins in with the genetic code of the game. Since the protagonist is an American in the midst of a bunch of Germans, we wanted to reflect this in our choice of actors.\nIn the international English version, the main character Tannhauser speaks American English, while the townspeople of Tr\u00fcberbrook sport a (more or less) German accent. In the German version, it's vice versa: the protagonist might have a modest American accent, while the townspeople welcome him in regular German, most likely with a dialect. Both approaches bear a certain degree of entertainment, each in their own way.\nWe are btf, an interdisciplinary team with expertise in programming, game design, writing, animation, graphic design, sound design and production. The studio emerged in 2012 from a collective of art students in Cologne, Germany. If you are familiar with German television, you might know our late night TV shows \u00bbNeo Magazin Royale\u00ab or \u00bbSchulz & B\u00f6hmermann\u00ab or our web comedy series \u00bbGute Arbeit Originals\u00ab.\nAs passionate gamers and die-hard adventure game fans, we crave to develop video games. Our first two adventure games were addressed to the audience of our show \u00bbNeo Magazin Royale\u00ab and in German only, whereas the world of \u00bbTr\u00fcberbrook\u00ab is set in a genuine and independent universe.\nHello!\nOur small core team consists of Florian (director and game designer), Lea (the producer), Hans (technical artist), Lea (set designer), Simon (developer) and Benny (the character designer). The team is few and far between reinforced from the nucleus of btf by other artists, animators, designers and programmers.\nThe first ideas for Tr\u00fcberbrook date back as far as 2011, but pre-production was only started in 2014, when Florian approached the studio with the concept.\nSo far, we've managed to cross-finance the development mainly through side projects. To get things started, we received a funding for the game by the Medienboard Berlin-Brandenburg, a regional media development fund. But this will only get us so far, which is why we reach out to you via Kickstarter.\nThough the conceptual development is already finished and most of the assets are already prototyped and tested, there is still a long way to go. The money from Kickstarter will mainly be used for the creation of 20 hand-crafted miniature scenery models, for the development in Unity3D as well as for the creation of the many assets needed, like 3D-models, animations and sounds.\nHow the money will be used\nBut ... isn't there a publisher involved? Yes, we are happy that the game will be published by our friends at Headup Games, a small but well-known indie label from Germany. As it's a pure distribution deal they don't bring any money at the table and let us keep full creative control over our game.\nLore Items.  When we created the world of Tr\u00fcberbrook, it's characters and places, we always came up with little backstories for each and every detail. We always thought it would be wonderful and quite enriching to dive into the game if we had the chance to put all these little backstories right into the game. With this stretch goal, we'll fill the world with many little pieces that are basically not important to finish the game, but will give you a better immersion, like newspapers, posters, notes, TV shows, inscriptions, smalltalk dialogue parts and more! We hope you like this goal as much as we do, as it will make the game just more detailed.\nHandmade Soundscape. This is something we always wanted to do! We think our handmade environments deserve an equally handmade soundscape. This includes making foley sound effects in the studio as well as field recordings. This stretch goal is also aiming at making the game just better.\nNew Chapter: The Prologue. This is a big one. We came up with this some time ago and are still looking forward to this: The prologue, a whole new chapter of the game that was already written along with the main story, but didn't make it into the final concept due to financial restrictions. We would still like to add this missing piece to the game somehow. If we reach this stretch goal, we'll create this all new chapter, including new handmade miniature sceneries and new characters, giving you the opportunity to explore a new facette of the storyline. We'll release the prologue exclusively as a stand-alone mini-episode for all our backers first \u2013 though it may be available for regular buyers at some later point after the release.\nNew Chapter: The Interlude. Another new chapter with even more content and more puzzles. We can't talk about the content without spoiling it, but to give you an idea, the interlude will explore a stranger and more bizarre part of the plot, another twist, another turn, a detour, a pocket in subspace that needs to be rediscovered, a new little story to be experienced.\nMaking-of Video. As already mentioned in the comments, we've stored tons and tons of filmed material on our harddrives. These were originally recorded to be used for the Kickstarter video, which shows but a small fraction of all the stuff we did. We would love to put together a long hands-on making-of video that mainly concentrates on the model making process, spending time with the set designers in the workshop, showing the lighting and camera work and the magical process of photogrammetry. It's going to be techy and nerdy in the raw!\nDeveloper's Audio Commentary: Be it by the set designers, the digital artists, the sound designer or the director \u2013 there's an abundance of stories to tell about every little detail in our world as we've spent a lot of time fleshing everything out. The developer's audio commentary (can be switched on and off inside the game menu) will give you the opportunity to take a surreal and wild ride on our train of thought.

Reseached and written by ambitious Tr\u00fcberbrookian journalists, the Tribune provides you with the freshest news and most interesting snippets of world lore, interwoven with the town\u2019s rich history, even forboding events that might eventually be happening in the game.\nClick to enlarge and dive deep into the Tr\u00fcberbrookian world lore!\n  The Tribune is released as a single-image snapshot on a semi-regular basis and available both in English and German.\nClick to enlarge and find some hints to events happening in the game!\n  The following character designs and much more stuff will be featured in our art book:\nTannhauser, the American physicist\n  Gretchen Lemke, paleoanthropologist\n  Lazarus Taft, enigmatic inventor\n  Trude, inkeeper at the guesthouse Waldeslust\n  Dr. von Streck & Dr. R\u00f6mmler\n  Leni, the \"weird kid\" from Tr\u00fcberbrook Elementary\n  The Baron of S\u00fclz, a veteran of two wars\n  The alpinist\n  Sweetwater Lars, a sailorman with fear of open waters\n  Lessing, tin foil hat\n  Madonna L\u00fcbke, weatherwoman\n  Penelope Hades I\n  Penelope Hades II\n  Penelope Hades III\n   ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIf you're new to Kickstarter: You can support our game by selecting one of the rewards we prepared for you. If we reach our funding goal of 80.000 \u20ac, you enable us to develop the game from start to finish in every detail according to our vision. The amount of money you want to spend will only be collected if we reach our goal and you will receive your rewards once the game is released. If we fail to reach our goal though, your account won't be charged at all.\n\nThanks to a funding by the Medienboard Berlin-Brandenburg and our own crossfinancing through other projects, we were able to already finish a huge part of the game. Some of the most crucial phases lie behind us, like finishing the script, the dialogues and the game design. We've also built the first half of the scenery models and checked out the best workflows for our photogrammetry process. Also, all of the character designs are finished and some of them already modeled, rigged and extensively tested within the scenes. So there's is a good vertical slice \u2013 much more than a reliable and strong proof of concept. This was important to us before we even considered to do a Kickstarter, so we could show you a meaningful status of the project. In the months ahead, we want to finish and assemble all the missing parts and pieces according to a carefully fleshed out production plan.\n\nOf course, there can (and most likely will) always be surprises and challenges in the upcoming development. Bad examples: key team members might get ill or the office burns to the ground. Good examples: key team members are having a baby or win a once-in-a-lifetime trip to the moon. No matter what, we are determined to finish the project right on time and as soon as possible!\n\n\u201cNintendo Switch\u201d is a trademark of Nintendo. \u201cPlayStation\u201d is a registered trademark of Sony Interactive Entertainment Inc. \u201cPS4\u201d is a trademark of the same company.

I always had a fascination with these strange quirks of nature and thought it would be cool to do a range of them in miniature form.\nThe miniatures were sculpted by Radmir Achmentov. A very talented sculptor from Russia. I think he captured the essence of the characters very well and did a really good job! \nWe actually had commissioned them a pretty long time ago but they only arrived just recently due to some odd circumstances. Maybe the nature of the subject had something to do with that. But I'm happy that they are finally here and I can present them to you!\nWe have five (six including the Little Princess) different characters on offer in this campaign and if we do really well then I really hope we get to delve further into the subject matter and get many more Freaks done. I know that I have at least 20 more of them in mind so hopefully those might happen at some point also!\nThis campaign is pretty straightforward and small. I tried to stay as low as possible with the pricing of the miniatures. Hopefully you'll agree.\nAs said before we have five (six if you count the Giant & the Little Princess as two) miniatures on offer in this campaign. I've tried to take good pictures of them but the original sculpts proved quite difficult to photograph well due to the dark polymer clays that have been used. That's why I've also made some short video clips of them all which show them in all their glory. You can see these videos at the bottom of the page. I expect that the resin castings will be very smooth and even better looking as they always do.\nOnto the stars of the show!\nThe Ringmaster\nThe Bearded Lady \n Two-heads the musician\n The Giant & the Little Princess\n The Mighty Imp\nFor better views of the miniatures please scroll down for the videos. They show the sculpts quite well but are a bit big! :P\nThe sizes of each individual miniature are; (from bottom to top)\nRingmaster  45mm\nBearded Lady 52mm\nTwo-heads 47mm (hunched over)\nGiant 70mm & Little Princess 25mm\nMighty Imp 32mm\n             Shipping information:\nShipping will be charged during the Kickstarter and costs are as follows:\nMighty Imp & Ringmaster \u20ac3,-\nBearded Lady, Two-heads, Giant & the Little Princess \u20ac4,-\nThe Freak Circus! \u20ac10,-\nPlease add \u20ac1,- for each additional miniature you pledge for! (except for the Freak Circus! pledge, \u20ac10,- will be enough no matter how many extra miniatures you get!)\nThe company who handles our shipping proved he does a good job with our last three Kickstarters and shipping in general so we have every faith we can deliver on time once again. We don't think there will be a delay in packages going out to backers but would just like to add that delays can happen. Once the shipping company has your parcels it is out of our control. However we will do everything possible again to fulfill this Kickstarter on time.\nPlease note that we are not responsible for any customs or other fees that might occur.\nCredits\nAs always there are a few people I want to thank!

While we plan as carefully as possible, the production process doesn't always go smoothly... and we've got an example to show you!\n\nWhen we master moulded the sculpted greens, they all came out fine. But whenever you mould a miniature, you always get a mould line where the two halves of the mould join together. Ideally, you try to make sure this line doesn't run across any critical parts.\n\nOn the halfling mastiff-rider, this was a problem... the way she was moulded meant that the mould line ran across her face. This is something we want to avoid. There's a couple of ways to get around it; the first is to re-position the part. Problem is, this also alters the pose of the miniature, and can often spoil it. The other way is to add an extra bit of putty near the mould join, so as to shift the mould line across a bit. The tricky part is to keep it looking good!\n\nThis is what we did with the halfling.

So we're not printing just one volume, but two; approximately 320 pages each, and coming in an incredibly beautiful, foil-embossed slipcase designed by Danielle herself.\nWe're keeping the rewards simple: just the books; both books with sketches by Danielle; or both books with sketches AND a piece of original art from GwS (sold out!!)!\nThe Artist's Edition sketches will be lovingly drawn in colored pencil, an upgrade from Danielle's usual quick ink sketches.\nThe DELUXE Artist's Edition will also include an original strip from the series (Danielle will hand-pick a strip that suits your preferences), or the original art for the covers or slipcase, if you're quick enough to snap it up first!\n    This Kickstarter is International-Shipping-Friendly!\nIron Circus Comics is excited to announce that this Kickstarter marks their  very first partnership with Blackbox, a fulfillment company from the folks behind Cards Against Humanity!\nWhat does that mean in practice? That international shipping costs for this project will be much lower than we've ever been able to offer before, by as much as 85%. Blackbox manages this by shipping individual orders from other nations, reducing taxes and fees significantly.\nCheck out out backer levels and see our new shipping fees for yourselves!\nPromo video created by Matt Sheridan and Danielle Corsetto.\nAll art by Danielle Corsetto\n\"Golden Sparkle Transition\" by Azmara\n\"Transitions All-in-One\" by AvidEditor\n\"Rock Together\" by SionSounds\nAssorted sound effects from Freesound\n ***JUST ADDED: Stretch Goal!***\nWe weren't going to do any, but I figured it couldn't hurt to aim high and offer something that a *LOT* of people have been requesting: a pull-out insert of the rules to Strip Drunk Scrabble! \nIf we hit $300k, every book will include a copy of the rules that you can remove and keep inside your Scrabble box. (PDF peeps, we can just send you the PDF of it!)

To paint miniatures, you need a Wet Palette to keep your paint moisturised. Today there is no straight forward solution on the market. That's why we created Everlasting Wet Palette, with best in class hydration system and easy to use and to carry airtight case. \nIt's actually so good that it is approved by Pro Painters all around the world\nWith Everlasting Wet Palette, you will save your acrylic paint, save your time and be able to master painting techniques like a pro. Stand back, relax and focus on what's important: enjoying your painting sessions.\nBecause acrylic paint dry really really fast! So fast, you can't even take a short break or perform advanced techniques !  Everlasting wet palette is a must-have to enjoy your painting session :\nSave paint: the paint won't dry out during your painting session\nStart and stop at will: you can stop painting for a few minutes, hours or days, and find again workable paints when you come back\nAchieve advanced technics: thanks to Everlasting stable hydration system, and our smooth surface, you will be able to perform advanced technics like Glaze, Gradients, Blending, 2 Brush Blending\nAnd it's easy to use: it works straight out of the box, and the case, wells and brush holders were designed for your to enjoy your miniature painting!\nPainter (5,9\" x 7,9\"): easy to store and carry, small to medium working space\nStudio (7,9\" x 11,8\"): extra large for Pros and Enthusiasts, medium to large working space\nNo bleeding\nNo drying\nNo overflowing\nPerfect to master advanced painting techniques\n Your paint stays wet for hours when working, for days if you close the lid! You can stop and start your painting session at will.\nMold resistant foam\nHydration paper sheets cut to dimensions \nResistant hydration paper\n\n For your inks, ultra high dilutions and other nasty stuffs. Wavy was designed to have a small foot print  \nAt the last stage of the Everlasting Wet Palette development, we sent prototypes to dozens of independent reviewers. The feedback has been overwhelmingly positive, and we have also been able to incorporate a lot of suggestions from them into our design! But don't just take our word for it:\nSee reviews on our website !\nSHOSHIES MINIS : \" I will definitely buy one of those\"  \nSPIKEYBITS : \" I will keep it on my desk\"   \nGEEKDAD : \"you'll love the thought that has gone into the product and find it improves your painting experience too\"  \nNEXT LEVEL PAINTING : \"I am not a wet palette guy, but I was pretty impressed!\"  \nMAGABOTATO : \" Foam and paper works perfectly for me\"\nFIGUREMENTORS : \"I have been very impressed with the prototype and these could be the next BIG thing\"\n(Please note that we did not and will never pay for reviews.)\nPaint stays moist and stable for hours and days\nHydration system is easy to setup and prevents bad smells\nThe unique case is easy to use with perfect dimensions\nEverlasting Wet Palette is leak resistant, easily portable and made of solid materials\nWavy design brush holder and well palette magnet accessory\nEngineered to the last details\nYour paint dilution will stay stable during your painting session for hours. The paint will not bleed and will not dry. The perfect hydration will help you master the painting techniques like a pro. This cannot be reproduced without our paper and foam.\nIf you close the lid the paint will stay fresh for days.\nAll this right out of the box\nOur foam holds a lot of water compared to its size ! The final foam will be thicker than the one used during reviews and reaches 3.5mm for improved hydration while retaining the same quality.\nOur special foam is naturally mold resistant. No anti-mold chemicals are added to the foam, and the effect will not wear out over time. So no bad smell after a few days, even when not stored in a fridge. Long lasting, you just need to rinse it from time to time with fresh water.\nOur paper is the perfect match for our foam. It sticks on it, and does not create bubbles. 100% of the paper is in contact with the foam, for perfect hydration. It will not curl after the easy setup. It was particularly selected to offer the best performance with hobby paints and level of dilution used in hobby painting.\nMachine cut to exact dimensions, taking into account the swell effect due to the water contact\nThe overall color is neutral, light gray, so that you can paint with \"true colours\"\nWe designed Everlasting Wet Palette with perfect dimensions :\nFor easy access. \nLow raise\nCompact foot print.\n2 sizes are available to cater to different needs : \nPainter size, 15 by 20 cm (5,9\" x 7,9\"), made for miniature painters looking for a good sized palette, that is compact and easy to carry. It's perfect for small to medium sized paint stations. Painter Everlasting Wet Palette can be extended using the top lid as a side Palette.\nStudio size, 20 by 30 cm (7,9\" x 11,8\"), made for Pros and Enthusiasts looking for a huge painting area. It's perfect for medium to large sized paint stations. Studio Everlasting Wet Palette can also be extended using the top lid as a side Palette.\nWhen we built Everlasting Wet Palette we decided to make it :\nAirtight, and leak resistant. We selected a TPE seal for its durability and so that it is easily operable.\nAlso, the hydration system is really stable and does not move during transport, as the foam sticks to the case naturally. \nThe provided strap also contributes to making Everlasting Wet Palette a great palette to move around. The strap selected will be durable, made of Polyamide.\nFinally, we selected strong, high quality ABS plastics for its durability and stability.\nWavy is the first magnet accessory available for Everlasting Wet Palette. We wanted to reinvent the way people use wells in miniature painting, by deciding on a compact size, but yet stable system thanks to the magnet. That way you can paint without fearing of hitting your wells and without consuming too much space for them. We then associated it with a brush holder. \nWavy can be attached to your case in no time to the front, back, left or right side of the palette.\nAt RedgrassGames we pay a lot of importance to details, so that we obtain a perfect product at the end. For instance : \nThe top lid can be stored under the bottom case\nDraft angles of case and Wavy are adjusted for perfect match \nFeet are optimised for easy elastic setup... \nBottom Case and Wavy fit perfectly\nEasy elastic strap operation\nThe top lid can be stored under the bottom case\n All pledges are Kickstarter exclusive packs.

", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe worked hard to bring the utmost quality at the best cost to our backers during the design and planning stage. We worked with 3D printed models, reviewed suppliers, samples and involved amateurs and professional painters to ensure product fit and efficiency. We are proud of the results and we now want to make sure to deliver it to you timely and as intended.\n\nThe main risks are concentrated in the production and delivery stages. Drawing on our extensive experience in driving large projects we took the following measures to mitigate any risks. \n\nFor the production stage, we rely only on suppliers with expertise and appropriate production capacity in their fields :\n- Wet palette enclosure and air tight cover: Best expertise for this type of product is in Asia. From experience, to secure the sourcing and production, we will rely on a seasoned and specialised Taiwan based procurement manager. This will ensure quality, timely delivery of the product and that we can meet CE environmental and work standards. \n- Advanced Foam and hydration paper : We identified several suppliers with adequate production quality. The main issue here will be to control the exact cut size as both the foam and the paper tend to expend when wet and retract when drying. \n\nFor logistics, we planned the sourcing flows from factories. The complexity will then depend on backers volume by region. We will set up regional hubs if needed to optimise delivery. However some remote regions might experience slightly increased delays depending on local regulations or customs requirements.\n\nFor non miniature hobby painter interested in our product, we have selected and tested the product to work best with hobby paint and dilution used in hobby painting. We could not test all artistic paints available, and results could vary.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u20ac1 or more", "title": "Thank you and stay in the loop", "descp": "Our warmest thank you and we will keep you updated!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2017"}], "stat": ["116 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac25 or more", "title": "Painter pledge - 100x", "descp": "World best everlasting wet palette + all applicable stretch goals\nINCLUDES:\n100\u00d7 Hydration paper sheets\n2\u00d7 Mold Resistant Hydration Foams\nCool case + Strap band\nWavy Well Palette\nVideo Setup Tutorials\nShipping not included.

Her portraits depict an emerging Chinese subculture that defies imposed expectations and stereotypes: GIRLS are badassed and self-aware with a supreme sense of cool, yet also insecure, vulnerable and torn. Luo photographs the girls around her, attempting to grasp an understanding of their lives as well as her own. Although different, they share the same ambivalent emotions, confusions and concerns. It is in that connection that Luo finds the strength and fragility of her subject. \n\u201cBy shooting girls I understand their life better and it makes my own world bigger and wider. We might have different values and worldviews, but what we have in common are a fragility and braveness inside of us. We face the world with our sincerity.\u201d  (Luo Yang)\nBorne from this intuitive dialogue with her subjects, Luo\u2019s images are bold and honest, intimate and sensitive at the same time. Her work explores the themes of youth and femininity, while challenging traditional beliefs about women in Chinese society. \nABOUT US: LUO YANG & MO\nLuo Yang, born 1984 in Liaoning Province in China's northeast, is a freelance photographer living and working in Beijing & Shanghai. One of the \"rising stars of Chinese photography\" (New Statesman, 2012), she has had numerous exhibitions in China and participated in major shows in Europe, amongst them Ai Weiwei\u2019s \u201cFUCK OFF 2\u201d at the Groninger Museum, Netherlands, in 2013. Solo exhibitions in Berlin and Hong Kong have since contributed to her international recognition. In her work, highly staged portraits and carefully constructed poses alternate with a raw, blurred snapshot-aesthetic. She works with film cameras only, deliberately slowing down the creative process and focusing on a particular moment itself rather than on elaborating and refining an image in post-production.\nMO-Industries is a POP-UP gallery staging cultural exchange between Asia and the West. It is a young venture that started at the end of 2015. Luo Yang and MO have been a team since the beginning of 2016, working closely on internationally showcasing Luo Yang's work, while scouting & introducing other exciting artists from China to the West (and vice versa).\nPlease support us in realising this beautiful project!\nTHE BOOK IN FACTS:\nThis compilation, published in a stunning silk-lined hardcover, is scheduled to be released by a renowned publishing house in Vienna in November 2017, reaching international bookstores in Spring 2018.

In order to share rules for the new units I periodically release a small digital magazine called 'The Twilight Traveller' or individual Playtest Scrolls. The time has come to pull together all the new releases from the last couple of years into a new Compiled Traveller! I will also be producing an accompanying deck of cards so you can start playing straight away.\nThe Traveller returns\n  This issue of the Compiled Traveller will include lots of new units! The magazine has a general focus on the Engineers of Anyaral, otherwise known as 'Rahkiri'. These eccentric individuals have been a part of Twilight ever since I first started exploring the world so I think it's about time they got a bit more attention! \nAt the moment the magazine is 24 pages long and includes rules for:\nBelomoch dre Hearn and his explosive automata\nBelan Rider\nToloran Cavalry\nNobleguard Crossbow\nImperial Standard\nThe Pree Pree!\nDhogu Archer and Yirnak Captain\nTak Sirahn\nThe Yartain and pups\nKoi-Koi and Jakiin\n As with the other Twilight Kickstarters I have chosen a suitably eccentric Fubarnii to guide the way: Belomoch dre Hearne. Belomoch was created as part of a previous Kickstarter as a thank you for my friends, Ben and Louise Trayhorn. \nBelomoch dre Hearn and his automata\n As tends to be the case with these random creations, he's thoroughly made his home in Anyaral. He is an eccentric engineer from the coastal region of Teral who at an early age (after blowing up a local garkrid resin refinery) was sent to one of the colleges of Larigal. He has spent the following years causing plenty of trouble while experimenting with explosives and the interactions between living creatures and mechanical devices.\nBelomoch is included in the Tinkerer pledge for an extra \u00a36 over the Traveller but will normally sell for \u00a39 so it's a great opportunity to add him to your collection!\nFor this campaign I'm keeping the pledge levels very simple! You can do the basic pledge for the Compiled Traveller and the cards for \u00a310 or get Belomoch as well as the book and cards for \u00a316.\nThe Traveller (\u00a310): A printed copy of the Compiled Traveller 2 and the associated deck of 16 reference cards\nThe Tinkerer (\u00a316): Belomoch Dre Hearne with two automata, a printed copy of the Compiled Traveller 2 and the associated deck of 16 reference cards\nThe Newcomer (\u00a3100): Everything you need to start playing\nThere is a small additional charge for postage.\nNote that all models are supplied unpainted.\n If you would like to add anything to your pledge, then just increase the pledge by the necessary amount. There will be a pledge manager at the end of the campaign so you can tell me what exactly you would like!\n                                          If this is the first you've heard of Twilight and Anyaral then you've got a whole world to explore! There is a lot of background on the World of Twilight page about the Fubarnii Empire, the Delgon, the Dhogu, the Devanu and the Casanii. You can also check out the previous Kickstarter pages (Travels through Anyaral and Casanii of Anyaral).\nYou can download the first edition of the rules here, as well as early issues of the Traveller, which give a good idea of what to expect!\nTak Sirahn and Yartain\n  Mike Thorp (The Creator): Mike has done most of the work creating the world of Twilight. He first started sketching the Fubarnii and Devanu over 15 years ago and since then he has taught himself to sculpt, written and playtested the game and self-published three books in order to bring the world to life.   \nJoe Karame (The Painter): Over the last few years Joe has been bringing the metal and resin sculpts to life with beautiful paintjobs. Joe runs his own miniature business, Joek Miniatures which has become increasingly focused on his fantastic sci-fi Odyssey universe.\nTwilight Helpers (The Minions): There are countless people who have helped me get this project up and running. Particular thanks goes out to Vivek Chandra, Louise and Ben Trayhorn, Paul Townsend and of course my ever-tolerant family (Jules, Lexie and Emily).\nNobleguard of Gar Loren\n  Those of you who follow on Facebook will have seen a few hints about the upcoming Kedashi releases...

To this day I\u2019m still amazed by the support we received for that project. Thanks so much to everyone who helped us! \nWhen I was digging through old sketchbooks and digital art files for the first book, I found so many sketches, speed paints, and rough works that I wanted to share. Instead of squeezing them all into the first book, we felt that they warranted their own space, which is why we are launching this new campaign for The Sketchbook of Loish.\nSketches are particularly interesting due to their raw and expressive nature, and they give the viewer an insight into the artist\u2019s unique creative process. This book will showcase my traditional and digital sketches, ranging from character sketches to environment speed paints. It will feature both old and new work, including exclusive artwork that will only be available through this book.  \nMy goal is not only to give insight into my creative process, but also to share my knowledge through tips and tutorials. It will contain resources for artists who are just starting out, and also for more experienced artists who want to learn more about my digital workflow and techniques.\nThrough this campaign, we will be offering a unique opportunity for backers to get signed and numbered copies of The Sketchbook of Loish, as well as the first art book (The Art of Loish), which you can get together as a bundle. There\u2019s also a limited number of signed prints available, featuring exclusive artwork made just for this campaign.\nAll backers will be able to download a tutorial video that teaches my process for digital speed painting. Four speedy backers will also get the chance to buy a unique original sketch!     \nPlease note that the number of signed copies are limited and will no longer be available once these rewards run out! This campaign is the only opportunity to get this bundle of books, stretch goals and goodies. It will also be the only way to get copies of the book with the unique numbered certificate. However, after the campaign ends, The Sketchbook of Loish will be available through the 3dtotal online shop, Amazon and all good book retailers.  \nMy first book, The Art of Loish, turned out to be a huge success. Backers of the first campaign received the book in a beautiful mailing carton, along with a few awesome stretch goal rewards. 3dtotal Publishing has a history of fulfilling Kickstarter campaigns to a really high standard, and has established successful distribution methods. By teaming up with them, I am confident that can achieve the same high standard of service and delivery, and another fantastic art book with incredible extras for you to enjoy. \nFor anyone who missed the Kickstarter for my first book, The Art of Loish, you can still buy a copy here.\nKickstarter gives us a special opportunity to thank those who make the book possible, by adding stretch goals and extras to the campaign.

If the second parcel is lost, we will not be able to offer a refund.  \nFor those who are not familiar with Kickstarter, it\u2019s a worldwide crowd-funding platform for artists and their creative projects. Once the funding period ends, we will start finalizing the book and the extra rewards, which will be sent to you in March 2018. About a month before that, we will send you a survey through Kickstarter, asking for your address - the reason we wait until a few weeks before is so that we have everyone\u2019s most up-to-date details. When the survey is ready for you to fill in, you will receive an e-mail through Kickstarter. We ask that you fill the survey in as soon as possible, to avoid any delays in sending out your reward!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe learned a lot from the first Kickstarter, particularly when it comes to managing the logistics for such a high number of backers!

We're Big Punch Studios (a.k.a. Nich, Lucy, Jon and Ali) and together we make all manner of adventures in comics and games. We're the team behind 7STRING and Afterlife Inc., and we also made Sandwich Masters, a game of strategy, sabotage and sandwiches. Together, we handle all aspects of production on Extraversal, from script to art to publication, with help from our amazing team of freelance artists: Jack, Verity and James.\nWe began publishing Extraversal in 2015 as a way of telling more stories from our expanding multiverse. But don't be fooled: while the genres are different - spanning sci-fi, fantasy and comedy - this is one world, one story, told from different angles. Characters walk between pages, appearing in unexpected places. A mystery is developing across the Extraverse, and it's too big for any one universe to contain.\nThe individual issues of Extraversal are available to our Patrons and followers as a subscription service, but you can catch up on the story so far on our website. We're so excited to bring the collected edition of Extraversal Year 1 to life as a beautiful new book.

They where one of the first things I remember drawing as a kid, and they captivated me. I had tons of dinosaur books, many of which I never got tired of looking at. I studied dinosaurs, I drew dinosaurs, and I even made my own little books. As a concept artist creating worlds in the video game industry,  I still  have this dream that's been left unchecked, and that's to create my own world, and put it all in my own dinosaur book. My ultimate goal for this book is that it would inspire anyone who looks through it, the same way my dinosaur books inspired me when I when I was a kid.\n    Dinosaurs of the Wild West will be an art book. It will be hardcover, 11\" x 8.5\" and over 130 pages (please note the book image is a mock up, and the dimension size will be a little different). It will contain black and white illustrations, and paintings depicting dinosaurs and people of the old west living together. It won't just be cowboys either, you'll see Native Americans, outlaws, settlers, towns folk, and many more. You\u2019ll visit towns, vast landscapes, and you'll even have a map so you wont get lost. You will also see all of my development sketches, and early drawings, plus a look into my process of  how I create these illustrations\n      The way Kickstarter works is that I can raise funds upfront from pledges made by backers.  Any amount you pledge is more than appreciated, and I'm very grateful! Below you will see a visual break down of the reward tiers so you can see what prints and original art is included. There are TEN original pieces of art, one per set, once they're gone, they're gone. You can see which drawing you get with the sets below, and you can select the rewards you want to pledge to on the right. \n                                        This is my first ever book, and kickstarter campaign. I'm coming to kickstarter because I need funds for the printing costs of the book (which isnt cheap), the cost of the reward prints, the shipping and packaging costs, and the kickstater fees. \n    I'm aiming for a March 2018 release to get everything sent out to backers. This gives me enough time to finish the content for the book, and allows for the 2 months it takes to get the book printed and shipped to me.\n    I've been drawing and creating my own worlds since childhood. I love drawing so much that I turned it into a career. For seven years I've been working as concept artist in the video game industry, and the last two and a half years were spent with Nintendo. \nI love drawing dinosaurs, animals and creatures. I also really enjoy history, with the American wild west being one of my favorite time periods.\nI live in the Pacific Northwest with my amazing wife and three crazy little doggies. \nThank you so much for taking the time to look my project, its a labor of love, and I want it to be the best book it can be. I hope that you would consider supporting me in making this book a reality. And if you like what you see, please share!\nbest,\nShaun", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe good news is that the content of the book is about 90% complete.

With the help of a hacker named Jin and the aid of a ragtag group of survivors he recruits along the way, Rook must explore the planet and locate the cell blocks which have detached from the prison's central tower and scattered across Earth's ghostly wasteland.\nDuring his mission, Rook will run into allies and adversaries in the form of dangerous gangs of fellow prisoners, the survivors of the Earth's mysterious apocalypse, and bizarre parasitic extradimensional beasts that haunt the dead planet. Core gameplay fuses platforming, pseudo-turn based combat, puzzle solving, and interactive dialogue/decision making into a story driven, atmospheric experience. Tying it all together is a unique visual aesthetic that merges lo-res pixel art characters with a lovingly hand-painted world.\nUpdate 3: Design Philosophy and Inspirations Pt. 1\nUpdate 4: Design Philosophy and Inspirations Pt. 2\nUpdate 6: Earth, 2171 AD\nUpdate 7: Battle System Breakdown\nUpdate 8: Add-Ons + New Character Reveals\nUpdate 9: Inventory System\nUpdate 10: New Add-Ons + Early Music + Skill Sneak-peek\nWe're very excited to be able to share a draft of a title theme for Wanderer done by our awesome composer Jonathan Geer:\nPLATFORMING\nWanderer is a cinematic platformer at it\u2019s core, a modernized take on classics like Another World, Flashback, and Heart of Darkness. Rook can walk, run, jump, crouch, and climb through the world. Additional movement abilities will be unlocked by the player as they advance, opening up the ways they can move around the environment. Light action elements include environmental hazards that Rook has to safely navigate and a ranged/melee attack used to stun/attack enemies that roam the world. Up to two computer-controlled companions at a time can be assigned to follow behind Rook as the player explores the world.\nThe game world consists of a simplified overworld map filled with locations to travel to and explore. It's centered around a hub where players can return to upgrade abilities and equipment and find companions stationed when not in the party.\nCOMBAT\nWhen Rook makes contact with an enemy on the 'field', the game switches to JRPG style pseudo turn-based combat (allowing the player to control all three current party members). Striking the enemy before they can strike you will give you a free first attack, and the same applies in reverse for the enemy, so you'll need to take note of how each enemy behaves and moves on the field to be successful.\nThe combat system is intended to be challenging and fluid, and is largely based on player skill and strategy rather than stats or random chance. Timing, reflex, and pattern recognition are emphasized, and the player will need to manually time and input offensive/defensive maneuvers to maximize their advantage in battle. Wanderer's battle system design is influenced by RPGs including Paper Mario, Valkyrie Profile, and Rogue Galaxy.\nPUZZLE SOLVING\nAs Rook explores and moves through the world he'll find points of interest represented by nodes that can be interacted with in familiar \"point and click\" adventure game fashion (look at, talk about/to, use item with, pick-up etc.). These interactions take place via a context sensitive radial menu that show the player which actions are available. Puzzles will require the player to examine and interact with characters, the environment, and obtainable inventory items to overcome obstacles and advance the story.\nBRANCHING DIALOGUE/CHOICES\nAlong Rook's mission, the player will have the opportunity to interact with a colorful and varied cast of characters via branching dialogue choices. The way the player chooses to respond to other characters will affect how they view him, and key points in the story will present the player with multiple ways to handle a scenario, each potentially leading to lasting consequences. Inspired by modern interactive narratives like Heavy Rain and Telltale's Walking Dead series, decisions and conversations will play out in real time, actively engaging the player in the scenario and sometimes requiring them to make choices on the fly.\nIn the fairly distant future, humans have escaped beyond the confines of their native planet after a mysterious, cataclysmic event has left it crawling with bizarre otherworldly creatures and turned it a place where time and space have come ever so slightly unraveled. With colonies on Venus, Mars, the moons of Jupiter, and dozens of massive space stations throughout the solar system, for much of humanity the Earth has become nothing more than a massive graveyard and a nostalgic memory.\nThe main character of the game's story, known simply as Rook, is an aged convict held in a state of stasis aboard an Alcatrez-esque orbital prison station designated the VC Harlegand. The Harlegand is stationed in the now isolated corner of the galaxy around Earth, making escape a nearly impossible prospect.\nAfter the prison crash lands on the Earth's surface for unknown reasons, Rook is awoken from his prisoner stasis pod by a hacker and fellow prisoner named Jin who's jacked into his neural implants remotely. Unfortunately, as a death row prisoner who was never intended to be fully resuscitated, upon waking Rook finds himself suffering from fragmented memory, recurring hallucinations, and painful migraines. The prison's medbay can ease his symptoms, but Jin need's Rook's help to reactivate it.\nProposing a plan to escape the planet, she suggests the two work together towards a common goal of survival. The duo embark on a journey to gather what she needs for them to escape, which entails traveling to each of the cell blocks that detached and scattered across the Earth's surface when the prison crash landed. Along the way they'll befriend fellow survivors, clash with gangs of dangerous criminals and monstrous creatures, and unravel the mysteries of the Earth's nebulous fate.\nSupplementary story elements unfold through optional text logs and entries to the player's codex gained by exploring and interacting with the world and speaking with characters. These offer additional detail and flavor to the game's setting for player's who are interested in it's backstory and lore.\nOn a secondary narrative level, a strong emphasis is placed on a diverse and engaging cast of misfits and survivors that Rook will encounter and work together with on his mission. Each ally has a unique backstory and viewpoint that the player will learn as they spend time together. As companions follow the player through the world, they'll often comment on the current scenario or begin a conversation amongst themselves that you can engage in while exploring (and even during combat!).\nHaving certain party members with you will also contextually open up new options and unique ways to deal with scenarios you encounter on your journey. These contextual bonus interactions not only serve to make party members feel autonomous and organic, but offer the player a meaningfully unique experience based on the companions they choose to bring with them..\nJust a few of the story's main characters include:\nThe player will also encounter a wide range of NPC factions that may help or hinder Rook depending on the choices that are made, each with a distinctive visual style, richly detailed background, and unique set of motives and objectives:\nThe player will also encounter bizarre alien parasitic entities nicknamed 'Phantoms', taking the form of a wide range of hostile creatures and beasts to fight, each with it's own capabilities, behaviors, strengths and weaknesses:\nWanderer is being designed as an episodic series. Episodes will be developed and released in sequential fashion, with each being released as soon as it's finished. Each new episode will add new content in the form of newly discovered areas on the world map (as well as hidden ones that must be discovered by other means), adding new objectives to push the main story forward as well as lots of side content to be completed at your own pace.\nEach area on the world map serves as a 'level', full of encounters, puzzles, obstacles, fights, and items. Some levels are much larger than others, and some contain purely optional content seperate from the primary story. You are free to come and go between areas as you please, and you'll sometimes need an item from one area to solve a puzzle on another. Past areas can be revisited in subsequent episodes, and sometimes new content will be added to old areas, so you'll have to keep an eye out and explore to get the most out of the world!\nFor the Kickstarter, we'll be funding the entire series as a whole, and a $15 or more pledge gains you access to all episodes. We're planning to develop 5 total episodes, but if we hit certain stretch goals, we plan to expand the scope of the game with additional episodes. The reason we're taking the episodic approach to development is to allow us to make an RPG with a greater sense of scope than we would otherwise be able.\nLike our favorite RPGs, Wanderer is a long, winding story full of twists and turns, evolving and growing character relationships, and lots of player character progression. To do it justice in a single development period and in a reasonable amount of time isn't a realistic goal for a two-man development team. That's why we're breaking it up into pieces, to make the project manageable and get the game into your hands much sooner. Another benefit is being able to engage with your feedback between episodes, and make sure each one is full of the best possible content!\nOur objective is to be able to release the first episode by September 2016, and then release subsequent episodes every 3~4 months.\nOur core team is composed of 2 individuals, an artist/designer and a developer/coder. The project found it's humble beginnings on the TIGSource forums, where Cris posted his initial pitch for Wanderer while searching for a developer to collaborate with. As fate would have it, Serge was looking for a new project to work on, and quite literally within five minutes after the creation of it's devlog, the two teamed up and Wanderer's development was underway.\nAfter months of searching for for a musician and composer that fits our vision of the game, we've recently teamed up with veteran Jonathan Geer, and we're very excited to have him on-board to bring Wanderer's soundtrack to life.\nJonathan's impressive versatility is a perfect match for Wanderer's concept, and will allow for the soundtrack to have an array of styles that complement the narratives blend of moods and tones. Though we hope to share a first look at the game's music with at some point during the campaign, in the meantime you can have a listen to an assortment of Jonathan's previous work:\nWanderer is a passion project that took over a year to completely conceptualize. It's a storytelling experience that strives to merge retro and modern design elements into something that feels new and fresh, but at the same time recalls nostalgia from our happiest gaming memories. It's a vision we're desperately invested in seeing come to life, but the only way it can become a reality is via the support of a crowdfunding campaign.\n\nDevelopment started 6 months ago, and our two-man team has made excellent progress towards a playable vertical slice of the game, with a prototype that already supports:\n\nThe game's platforming including full AI companion and enemy pathfinding.\nPuzzle solving/adventure game mechanics.\nAn initial implementation for combat mechanics.\nBranching and contextual dialogues.\nA custom and complete in-game scene editor with an advanced script system.\nAll the basic components like the save system, medias integration and management pipelines and an advanced and flexible rendering pipeline with light and post-processing effects.\nCurrently, our programmer is working a full-time job and our artist is living on savings in order to dedicate his time to the project. This is not a situation we can maintain long term. To continue working on Wanderer we need some additional support to allow us to dedicate our full time and attention to the project.\nFor physical rewards, we're very excited to have the opportunity to team up with wonderful IndieBox to bring you high quality items!\n\nWanderer is a passion project, the game we always wanted to play but no one ever tried to make. With your help, we can make it a reality! Thank you for time and support! Together, we know we can make a one of a kind gaming experience, and we want nothing more than to share it with you. :)", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWanderer is treading new ground in terms of core design structure, which is where we believe much of the appeal lies, but which also means there\u2019s an inherent amount of risk involved in execution. A lack of a tried and true formula means we\u2019re going into this endeavor largely without the benefit of footsteps to follow in regards to the flow of gameplay and the synergy of various hybrid mechanics. \n\nThis risk is why the game\u2019s core mechanics are designed with simplicity and elegance in mind. Adding too much complexity to too many potentially disparate mechanics could quickly muddy the design and make it very difficult to analyze what\u2019s working well and what\u2019s not. Keeping things simple and clean means we can make adjustments on the fly and adapt the direction and emphasis of core gameplay without losing lots of design work and development time.\n\nThe game is very ambitious in terms of scale and scope, especially given that development is handled by only the two of us. That\u2019s why early on we made the decision to divide it into episodes, to allow us to divide what would otherwise be an insurmountable amount of content into much smaller and more manageable milestones. \n\nFurther, the episodic structure additionally benefits us by allowing us to receive valuable player feedback between the release of episodes. This will help us steer the direction of content over the course of the games overall development cycle and gives us ample time to make adjustments as necessary.\n\nFinally, even though this is the first project our team is working on together, we've already made considerable progress on the development, and over the previous six months we've setup a very efficient and adapted workflow. Our pipeline is already established and proven, and we'll do everything in our power to stick to our projected deadlines and deliver the experience we've promised in our presentation.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #25", "update_userinfo": "July-August-September-October Progress Update", "update_content": "July-August-September-October Progress Update\nHey everyone.

Go to www.skyheartcomic.com to stay up to date on the project!\nI'm Jake Parker, and I'm making SkyHeart Book I: The Star Seed. \nSkyHeart is an all-ages graphic novel inspired by my favorite movies and comics. If you liked Miyazaki's Nausicaa, Star Wars, Tokien's The Hobbit, and Indiana Jones, then you just might become a fan of SkyHeart. \nSkyHeart will be a 7.5 x 10 inch 100+ page book that comes in both soft and hard cover editions. \nThe book is being written and drawn by me and is scheduled to be finished in May of 2016, and shipped out to backers in October of 2016.\nFor years I've been developing this project on the side, but it was so big, and so involved that it scared me! I felt I wasn't ready to create this book. \nAfter years working in animation as a concept artist (Horton Hears a Who, Rio, Epic) and comics (Flight, Missile Mouse, Rocket Raccoon) my skills as an artist and storyteller got better. I feel like I'm finally at a level now where I can take on a project like this and do it justice.\nSo...I'm going for it!\nThe Idea for SkyHeart was planted in my imagination over 15 years ago while on a road trip though the Arizona desert. I imagined the desert floor vanishing, leaving only an abyss of clouds with the rock formations suspended above them in the air.\nFrom that seed of an idea grew an entire world of characters and their struggles, with mythologies, cities, and technology fleshing out the rest of this universe.\nI love classic tales of adventure, of good versus evil, and struggles with real consequences. Which is why I look to films like Star Wars, Nausicaa, Castle in the Sky, and Indiana Jones, and books like the Hobbit for inspiration. Just because a story is all-ages, doesn't mean I can't enjoy it as much as my kids do!\nSkyHeart takes place on Airth, a world literally torn apart by a pre-historic war between the gods who created it. That war left the planet divided into 4 realms:\nThe Stratos, a chain of islands high in the sky where the Sylph people live.\nThe Rimland, a massive ring of continents and giant islands where most of the inhabitants of Airth live. Wake, our main protagonist, lives here.\nThe Abyss, a stretch of atmosphere filled with incredible cloud formations and tiny floating islands. Limberg and Grimm are from here. \nThe Core, an ocean covered rocky sphere filled with colossal caves. The Tengru, monsters and beasts, and the Dark Lord live down here.\nIn that great ancient war, the beings of Light were able to defeat the Shadows and banish them to the core, but not without a great cost. Losing most of their godly energy, they left Airth to search the universe for more power. Their children stayed to protect what was left of Airth from the evil trapped in the core. \nThousands of years later these pre-historic events have become myth, and the inhabitants of Airth are consumed with their own wars for power. \nHowever, deep in the core, the Shadows have not forgotten, and have begun sending their agents to the surface to harvest the people of their life force. Once enough of this power has been taken the Shadows will rise again to destroy the rest of Airth and start a new world.\nWake and his crew set off to find the Star Seed with the hopes of both saving Wake's mother, and the world of Airth. That is, if they can beat Malsang and his sinister tengru to it's secret location. \nHow Do Add Ons Work?\nI'll be using Backer Kit to handle rewards and add-ons. Here's what you do:\nAdd up the total of your selections (plus shipping if it applies) \nClick \"Manage Your Pledge\" in the upper right corner (blue button) \nAdd the total of your Add Ons to your pledge amount. You don't need to change the tier you've selected \nYou are done! Later you'll get a backer survey asking how you spent your add-on dollars and for other pertinent info. \nThank you!\n\nI'll be updating the add ons and adding more if the project funds and we hit stretch goals. I want to add a map of Airth, a poster, and more, so check back.\nI'm asking for A LOT of money. I've got a great youtube video here that outlines where all this money is going and how I arrived at this number. Basically, half the funds are going to the production of the content, and the other half is getting the books printed and shipped. \nHere's a breakdown of where the funds are going:\nPrinting: $12,000 This covers getting the books printed and shipped to my house. (15.4%)\nProduction: $42,000 This covers my time writing and drawing the book, paying a colorist, editor, and building the book and getting it ready for print. (53.8%)\nFees: $8000 This covers Backer Kit, Kickstarter and Amazon fees. (9%)\nShipping: $16,000 This covers packing up the books and shipping charges. I will be shipping the books PRIORITY MAIL to US backers to ensure the safe delivery of each package. International orders will all be sent FIRST CLASS. Orders will be packed in a bubble wrap sleeve, then put into heavy duty cardboard case. I talk all about how I ship things in this video. (23.4%)\nThis book will be produced in the spring and summer of 2016 and will be delivered to backers in September of that same year. Here's a rough timeline of the production:\nNovember: Run the Kickstarter\nDecember: Finish the SkyHeart manuscript\nJanuary - June: Drawing and coloring\nJuly: Building the book, and prepping for print\nAugust - September: Printing the book\nOctober: Packing and Shipping\nHi I'm Jake Parker, and here's a little bit about me written in third person to sound official: \nJake Parker is an illustrator and cartoonist. For the last 17 years he's worked on everything from animated films to comics to picture books. His credits include the animated films Titan A.E., Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs, Horton Hears a Who, Rio, and Epic. \nHe illustrated the New York Times bestselling book The Astonishing Secret of Awesome Man, and went on to also illustrate The Girl Who Wouldn't Brush Her Hair, The Tooth Fairy Wars, The Little Snowplow, and most recently finished his first children's book that he also wrote, Little Bot and Sparrow which will be available in fall of 2016.\nAlong with children's books Jake also draws comics, and recently finished five issues of Marvel's Rocket Raccoon. His Missile Mouse graphic novel series, published by Scholastic, have sold over 100,000 copies. His own self-published comics anthology The Antler Boy and Other Stories was funded through Kickstarter at over $85,000. \nJake is the creator of the Inktober challenge and World Art Drop Day, with both initiatives involving thousands of artists across the world.

Fight on battlefields where death is impersonal and only a heartbeat away. March your troops across green fields, through muddy trenches, over snow-capped mountains or into dank caverns... Come fight in the world of Panzerf\u00e4uste and see if you can reign supreme in The Land!\n\nPanzerf\u00e4uste is a fun 'Historo-Fantasy' miniature wargame setting, in which 28mm scale miniatures are used to depict the everyday struggles of standard fantasy races such as Orcs and Dwarves fight out battles with 20th century weaponry. \nSo welcome to Panzerf\u00e4uste, welcome to Hysterical Games, make yourself comfortable, for you are in for a treat!  \nFor more information, don't hesitate to visit our Website: http://www.hystericalgames.co.uk \n And, for all the latest updates and news, please 'Like' us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/HystericalGames\nWe've made loads of headway!

Just follow this link to a spreadsheet!\n\nhttp://www.rrhughes.com/panzerfauste.xlsx\n\nAll of the current freebies are listed at the top of the spreadsheet, and all current stretch goals factored in, as well as the next 3 stretch goals.\nInspired by Tolkien, Pratchett, the history of the two world wars and everything in-between; Panzerf\u00e4uste is split into two rule-sets. Both the Skirmish Game and Mass Battle-Game rules simulate all of the vagaries of modern warfare, including fatigue and morale, but also mix in a flavour of fantasy through racial traits, magickal spells and fantastic abilities. \nThe game can be played using the Skirmish rules, with a Section of infantry or played using the Mass Battle rules which cater for collections at Platoon to Company level, with two or three Sections of troops, armoured support and a character or two making up the bulk of most games. This means that the average game of Panzerf\u00e4uste requires no more than 30 or so miniatures. \n\nYou can download the Beta rules for Panzerf\u00e4uste: Skirmish here: SKIRMISH BETA RULES\nYou can download the Beta rules for Panzerf\u00e4uste: Mass Battle here: MASS BATTLE BETA RULES\n\nPanzerf\u00e4uste miniatures will be manufactured in a high quality and resilient polyurethane resin material, perfect for miniature gaming figurines.

However, the obvious ones to me now are: \n\n1. Printing - This is outsourced, we don't envisage any problems but it is possible there could be unavoidable delays for reasons beyond our control. We have 3 suppliers lined up. \n\n2. Manufacture of miniatures - We have decided to take upon the ourselves. Rob is a talented mouldmaker and caster, who has worked professionally on resin casting for a number of years. This will allow us to update you all with the most up to date information that we can provide. Some elements may be outsourced, but this is unlikely. \n\n3. Rules development - With the help of you guys, there should be no issue here. \n\n4. Popularity - We're confident that our planning will avoid this! However, it's worth saying the obvious which is that the more popular the project is, the more stretch goals there will be and the more product we have to provide. In every Kickstarter, this causes delay. \n\n5. Shipping - International customers (outside of the EU) may encounter unexpected import taxes and/or delays in customs. You can contact your customs department for more information. We are aiming to use UPS, who have a stellar track record. \n\nThroughout this Kickstarter, we will make sure that you guys are communicated with to the best of our ability, to show exactly where we are and exactly where any delays are coming from and how we are tackling them. We have all of the concept art done for the next 3 Factions and the rules are basically there.

We don't use a pledge manager\u2014backers may NOT increase their pledge or add on more items at the KS prices after the campaign ends. Future pre-orders and add-ons can be made on our website.\nDesigned by Jamey Stegmaier (Viticulture & Euphoria) and based on the art and worldbuilding of Jakub Rozalski, Scythe is a 4x game (explore, expand, exploit, exterminate) set in an alternate-history, 1920s Eastern Europe. Scythe tells the stories of 5 factions competing over an unclaimed patch of land surrounding the mysterious Factory.\nDuring Scythe's 750+ blind playtests, the playtesters consistently said they most enjoyed:\nthe dual benefits of the upgrade system (increase an action benefit and decrease a cost)\nthe distinctly different faction and mech abilities\nthe thematic choices presented by the encounter cards\nthe asymmetry and variability created by random pairings of faction and player mats\nthe twist to area control due to all resources being kept on the board\nCheck out the Scythe rules and playtest print-and-play files to see how Scythe blends an engine-building system inspired by Terra Mystica with a deterministic combat system influenced by Kemet. Renders of the 25 miniatures in Scythe are below the \"What's in the Box?\" image.\nTo add items onto your pledge, manually add the $ amount during the project. We don't use a pledge manager, so all pledges must be made in full by November 5. You can mix and match up to 3 total games (any version) and any number of add-ons. On the post-project survey, you will tell us the various items that comprise your pledge.\nEach player is represented on the board by a character and their animal companion (1 miniature). Each character miniature has a 25mm base and a height of 36-58mm.\nEach faction has 4 mechs in their faction color that can be deployed during the game. Each mech miniature has a 30mm base and a height of 26-36mm.\nThis is an example of a faction mat (the Rusviet faction). This shows your faction's special ability, starting military strength, mech abilities, and one-time recruit benefits.\n                                                                                                                                                        This is an example of a player mat (\"Patriotic\"). Each player mat is divided into four sections, each with a top-row action and a bottom-row action. Your actions improve as you build your economic engine.\nThe highly detailed game board for Scythe (full board on left, sample territory on right) depicts the areas near the mysterious Factory. This is a fully-formed world with a specific story, so the board is not modular (see FAQ for more details).\n                                             All promo items are included in every Kickstarter game for free and will be available for additional cost post-Kickstarter (there is no Kickstarter-exclusive content).

We'll even pay for return shipping.\nThe Factory promo pack contains 6 extra Factory cards for Kickstarter backers. The promo pack will be available for an additional cost to those who discover Scythe after the Kickstarter campaign.\nIt may not be these exact Factory cards that end up in the promo pack.\nThe custom metal coins  (80 total) featured in the Premium, Collector's, and Art Connoisseur Edition games were designed specifically for Scythe. The set of coins is available for order by itself on the Stonemaier Games website for $25 (+ shipping) or as an add-on to any copy of the game for $22.\nThe plastic resource containers (4 total) in the Premium, Collector's, and Art Connoisseur Edition games allow for easy storage, setup, and distribution of the various tokens and coins in Scythe. There's room for exactly 4 of these containers in the Scythe box.\nPlastic container with coin prototypes.\nThe board extension in the Collector's and Art Connoisseur Editions slides next to the back side of the game board, creating a complete board with +50% bigger hexes (the content is the same; see Update 3). All units and resources in Scythe are kept on the board, so the larger hexes provide more space.\nThe game board is 624x818mm, and it grows to 818x936mm with the extension. It is available as an add-on to any copy of the game for $10 (every game board is double-sided) and will be available to order from our website by itself for $12 (+ shipping) after the project ends.\nThe realistic resource tokens (made out of resin or zinc) in the Collector's and Art Connoisseur Editions replace the wooden resource tokens (there are no wooden resource tokens in those editions). They include 80 tokens (20 each) for food, metal, oil, and wood. These tokens are available in our treasure chests (one in each chest), as well as in an add-on to any copy of the game for $21.\nThe individually-numbered boxes in the Collector's and Art Connoisseur Editions are randomly assigned. The limit of these boxes will be determined by the total number of backers at those levels.\nThe art book included with the Art Connoisseur Edition is a 100-page, full-color, hardback collection of the art featured in Scythe, as well as other pieces in Jakub Rozalski's acclaimed 1920s series. The book will measure approximately 250x290mm. It's available for pre-order by itself on the Stonemaier Games website for $25 (+ shipping) or as an add-on to any copy of the game for $23. The art book will be packed externally from the game box.\nThe wooden resource tokens aren't in the Collector's and Art Connoisseur Editions, so if you want both one of those games and wooden resources (or if you just want extra resources with any version of Scythe), please add $10 to your pledge. This is for an external pack of 20 food/grain, 20 metal, 20 wood, and 20 oil tokens.\nSamples on the left; final colors on the right.\nWe ship games in bulk to fulfillment centers around the world to reduce customs fees & VAT and to keep shipping prices low (this method is explained here; country codes are here).\nBackers are limited to 3 total games per pledge (a mix of any 3 versions of the game is fine; only pay the shipping fee once per pledge, not once per game). To add more games beyond the first (or add-ons), manually enter the $ total when making your pledge or click the blue \"Manage\" button next to a previously made pledge.\nAn example of an encounter card. When your character reaches certain parts of the board, they encounter a situation that gives you a choice of one of the three options.\nWe like to support game stores around the world by offering the special Kickstarter versions of the game to retailers during the campaign. We treat retailer backers just like other backers in that they receive their rewards before we release regular retail games into distribution.\nIf you're a retailer, please contact Jamey at stonemaiergames@gmail.com during the campaign for pricing information. After the campaign, you can reserve retail copies of Scythe by contacting our distribution broker: paul@greaterthangames.com\nAn example of an objective card. Each player receives 2 objectives at the beginning of the game and can complete one of them as a goal.\nJamey Stegmaier is the designer of Scythe, Viticulture, Tuscany, and Euphoria. He's also the co-founder and president of Stonemaier Games, and he's written a book about crowdfunding.\nJakub Rozalski is the artist, worldbuilder, and creative director of Scythe. Art prints of his work are available for purchase from him here.\nMorten Monrad Pedersen is Stonemaier's development specialist.

Chandler, and features original Scythe music composed by Micha\u0142 Wo\u017aniak. The gif explaining the board extension was designed by Bryce Walter and reduced in size for faster loading times by Bruce Alcorn.\nPlaytesters: The development process for Scythe featured over 750 blind playtests and 628 individual playtesters. We owe a huge debt of gratitude to all of them, especially to Barry Schmaling (who built the playtester forum) and all of the lead playtesters. They had a lot to say about Scythe, but here are a few of our favorite quotes:\n\u201cFarm your little piece of the world, spread out and colonise as much as you can, or rampage with mechs projecting lethal force over your opponents. This game has it all and with so many routes to victory, no two games are the same.\u201d \u2014 Stephen \u2018Azrael\u2019 Ogden\n\u201cScythe is an excellent blend of resource management and conflict which also manages to leave you with a delightful sense of having told a story.\" \u2014 Andrew Busam\n\u201cThe Automa is challenging, relentless, and at times unforgiving, but it's also a whole lot of fun. It's a worthy adversary that earns a begrudging respect.\u201d \u2014 Jeremiah Power\nWhile we don't offer existing inventory or unrelated products as add-ons through Kickstarter, we offer other Stonemaier products on our website. These items will ship right away and cannot be held until Scythe ships.\nViticulture, Tuscany, Euphoria, Between Two Cities, and our treasure chests are also available from your friendly local game store.\nJamey's book, A Crowdfunder's Strategy Guide: Build a Better Business by Building Community, is available in a number of online and offline locations.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThrough Stonemaier Games, Jamey Stegmaier has raised over $1.4 million on Kickstarter and has delivered over 20,000 individual rewards to backers within a few months of the estimated delivery date (most are on time or early). He is an avid backer and gamer, and his book about crowdfunding was published in September 2015: http://stonemaiergames.com/kickstarter/book/\n\nHowever, Scythe presented three specific new challenges: miniatures, shipping, and balance.\n\nThis is our first time working with plastic miniatures. We had heard horror stories about other projects involving miniatures, and we've experienced a few as backers. So we wanted to start early to avoid some of the delays that can occur as the result of miniatures. We started working with Jakub and his 3D modelers in March, using Shapeways to print each version of the sculpts to see how they worked on the game board. We also worked closely with Panda's team throughout the process to make sure the sculpts are feasible and durable. We've created the molds for the miniatures and are ready for production.\n\nWe've picked up and dropped fulfillment partners over time, keeping those who pack our games well and excel at communication. Because shipping is particularly important for Scythe\u2014a big game with a box that we want delivered in pristine condition\u2014we tested out two new-to-us fulfillment partners (Funagain in the US and Snakes & Lattes in Canada) on our previous project in preparation for Scythe. We add those two to Ideaspatcher in Europe, Good Games in Australia, and Agility in China, all three of which we've worked on in the past and have had excellent results.\n\nOne of the main features of Scythe's gameplay is asymmetry between factions. It's tough to balance an asymmetric game, so after we got Scythe to a good place with local playtesters, we ran 3 different waves of multi-player blind playtesting and 2 waves of solo blind playtesting. The huge amount of anecdotal and quantitative data we collected as a result helped us ensure that Scythe is extremely well balanced (and fun!).\n\nIf you would like to know more about what we learned from our Kickstarter experiences and research, go to http://stonemaiergames.com/kickstarter/full-list-chronological/ to see 160+ Kickstarter Lessons to help you create a successful project too.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #46", "update_userinfo": "Introducing the Scythe Modular Board", "update_content": "Hi!

It\u2019s a truly unique fantasy world inspired by the very source of story telling, such as Beowulf, the Icelandic tales, the Finnish epos Kalevala, and also true art masters such as John Bauer and Akseli Gallen-Kallela.\nWe\u2019ve been rewarded with some of the most astonishing art from exceptional artists like Paul Bonner, Justin Sweet and Alvaro Tapia, just to mention a few.

It will not be sold or distributed to 3rd party. This is a one and only unique chance for backers to get the collected art of Trudvang in one book.\nShipping cost will be added to your pledge as you check out.\nOur goal is to produce one of the best art books ever made for a fantasy setting.

This is the second project launched on Kickstarter. The first one was successfully funded and was fully delivered on time. This time around this project is of a slightly larger magnitude where the goal is to raise funds for 12 characters for three different factions, which would allow for you to field them as a playable force for the game-to-be.\nAbout the funding goal of this project\u2026\nThe goal of this project is to attempt to raise funds for the production of 12 miniatures (see below) for three different factions (Outcasts, Exiles and Nomads). The miniatures are to be cast in high quality, non-toxic, resin. The scale of the miniatures are 35 mm (measuring to the eyes in a standing, straight pose).\nOut of the 12 miniatures for this project 11 have already been sculpted and pre-production resin casts have been completed and approved for final production for 10 of these. A successful project here will help me kickstart the miniature range.\nAbout the ultimate goal...\nThe ultimate goal is to develop a tabletop game with a focus on low-count skirmish confrontations, where each side will be able to field, as a standard, 5 characters. The aim is to create a fast-paced and easy-to-play game that focuses on strategy and team synergy, and where the players will be able to customize their characters after their preferred gaming style (within some limitations, of course). The game mechanics and rules are still a work in-progress and once finalized will be a free-to-download .pdf document. The priority right now is to release these miniatures in an attempt to create a brand to showcase, and then focus on getting the rules done.\nThe miniatures\nEach of the icons denotes what faction the character belongs to. An icon will be used on the images of the miniatures and concept art. Use the icons to help you to assemble your warband.\nScale reference shot\nAbout the world\u2026\nThe world is set in a dark and low-fantasy setting and the focus will be around men and beasts. While magic (inner abilities) is present in the world it isn\u2019t a dominating feature. However, any of the characters that will be able to use inner abilities could possibly play quite a central part of your warband!\nThe factions  \nThere are a number of factions under development, although the Outcasts, the Exiles and the Nomads have been progressed the furthest. Apart from these three there is also the Militia of the Free City of Rexen, the Guardians of the Raven Oak and the Clansmen of the Caer Loch.\n\"We are venom of this world, like poison running through your veins, you will suffer like we have suffered!\"\nThe Outcasts are feral men that have been shunned by their former society generations ago, and have now adapted to a tribal life where they live by the principles of might is right and the survival of the strongest. These men are divided into countless of tribes scattered far and wide, but can be found mostly in the most hostile of environments; barren lands, deep forests or around the vast mountains. They have turned primal and predatory and live day-by-day with no real thought of tomorrow, focused only on survival. Each tribe is built around the alpha - the strongest of the members - and many aspects of the hierarchy resembles that of a wolf pack. Each member of the tribe has to be able to carry his or her own weight, or be quickly preyed upon. The Outcasts, in general, are raiders, preying on settlements and other neighboring tribes. Only occasionally the tribal warring cease for a moment and they gather under a particular strong alpha and lay siege to larger towns and even cities.\nGameplay: Typically, the Outcasts will focus on an extreme aggressive playing style, where the faction\u2019s passive bonus will promote it. The Outcasts generally would do best in trying to outnumber his opponent, and once the first character falls to their brutality, they could quickly snowball out of control.\n\"Our will is strong, like iron, it will never break!\"\nThe Exiles of the Tetsu Clan were once a part of the Greater Raising Empire, where the leader of the clan even held seat as a trusted advisor to the Shogun himself. The Shogun was a man of tradition, and failed to see how the rest of the world was changing, despite being advised to adapt. This led to a great schism within the council that resulted in an uprising led by the Tetsu Clan, although most of the military power still remained loyal to the Shogun. The uprising was met with force and duly crushed, with no mercy being shown. The members of the Tetsu Clan, and its followers, were deemed as exiles and anyone giving them shelter or help would be seen as traitors and executed without trial. So they fled in order to rebuild and to, one day, return.\nGameplay: The Exiles, by tradition, take great pride in perfecting their skills in single-combat, and if they manage to keep the fighting one-on-one, their knowledge of duels could easily tip the battle in their favor. The Exiles favor neither offence nor defense over the other, but could be considered to be featuring a balanced approach.\n\"Like a storm gale we will sweep across the world!\"\nThe Nomads is a common name for the travelling people of the North. Some see them as barbarians and evil people, when in truth they are no more evil than anyone else. It is true that the Nomads expand their borders, usually along the coast-lines, using force as they do so. But the world is not a peaceful place, and these loyal people aim to secure the land for their families to settle. The Nomads of the Birch House is one of the more venturous of Houses and seeks to gain a foothold further away from their homeland than most others. As they spearhead the Nomads exploration they are among the most battle-tested veterans of their kin.\nGameplay: The Nomads\u2019 strength comes from relying on each other, knowing that a brother protects his flank and knowing that a solid shield-wall will refuse any aggression to come into fruitation. Their passive ability will make them stronger the closer they are to each other, and divided they risk being conquered.\nStretch Goals\nIf this project reaches the funding goal and if the campaign pushes on beyond it there will be stretch goals. However, as this is a very small project it's important not to over-extend as history of other projects have shown that it generally is a bad idea. Further stretch goals would potentially only be from concept art.\nPlease note that the shipping time for fulfillment might increase if you decide to add-on for a stretch goal for concept art! Any stretch goal is not included in the estimated delievery time that is noted under the pledge-levels.\nAdd-ons\nIf you are interested in adding more miniatures to your pledge, you may easily do so by adding an extra $15 to your pledge for each additional miniature that you wish to add. Please be aware that with the more miniatures added to the pledge, the higher the shipping can potentially become.\nSculptors\nPatrick Masson - Lo Jun, Otomo, Aktra\nJuan Navarro Perez - Shogi, Rigfr\nRoberto Chaudon - Faun, Kruuz\nLuc \"Thantor\" Pinganaud - Gorgr, Keras, Oren, Agni\nJody Siegel - Brokkr, Vakr\nShipping\nShipping can either be paid for during the Kickstarter project or it can be paid for separately through PayPal, bank transfer or money order of your choosing after the project has ended. To pay for it during the Kickstarter, simply add the corresponding amount listed below to your Pledge (by using the button \"Manage\"). Shipping will be done in a padded envelope. The miniature(s) will be protected by bubble wrap and placed in a simple kraft box for extra protection.\nShipping costs\n1-4 miniatures: 50 SEK (aprox. $5,75/\u20ac5.,5/\u00a33,75)\n5-12 miniatures: 90 SEK (aprox. $10,5/\u20ac9,5/\u00a36,75)\n13+ miniatures: 130 SEK (aprox. $15/\u20ac13,75/\u00a39,5)\nIf you want to pay for tracking (recommended letter) that will cost an extra 90 SEK in addition to the shipping cost (for example, shipping cost for 5 miniatures using tracking will be 180 SEK).\nShipping waves\nShipping will be done through \"waves\" as resin casts of the miniatures are produced and sent back to me. However, a small number of miniatures have already been cast and are ready to be shipped out. This means that it will be possible for me to start sending packages very soon after the project has ended. The ones who complete the survey I will send out (to gather shipping address, etc.) first will have their packages sent out first, as well.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is the second Kickstarter project Corvus Corax Miniatures is running, and the first project was successfully funded and fully delivered. I hope that counts for something when it concerns reliability.\n\nAnyone who has backed a Kickstarter before is well aware of some of the biggest risks with backing a project. I, myself, have backed over 30 different projects, and through that, I've got an insight on some of the difficulties with running a successful project. These risks are well considered and steps have been taken to attempt to minimize them:\n\n1.) Delays \n2.) Quality \n3.) Communication\n\nDelays \nLet's be frank here; delays appear to be norm rather than the exception. The reason for this one can only speculate in, which I will not do. I will instead give you my take on delays for this specific project.\n\nThis project is focused around raising funds for creation of miniatures, and because of this, there will be some risks involved with it. The risk comes from partners not being able to deliver on target. There are concept artists and illustrators, there are sculptors, there are casters, and then there are the different shipping companies. If one link in the chain breaks, it will obviously affect the rest.\n\nHowever, these types of delays should not be a problem. Most of the miniatures are sculpted and they have been cast in a number of copies already (11 of the 12 miniatures have been sculpted). The turn-around of this project should because of that be quite short for the first backers; and then shipping will go out in waves. Because of this I am confident that I will be able to meet the projected estimated delivery date for all backers!\n\nPlease be aware that none of the stretch goals are included in any of the sculpted miniatures. This means that if a stretch goal is reached a sculptor needs to be commissioned for it and then it needs to be sculpted. This could potentially mean delays simply because it being outsourced to third parties.\n\nQuality \nThere are always some concerns regarding the quality of material used for casting. For this project, I have worked together with a skilled caster with extended knowledge of the casting process. The resin is of high quality, holds detail great and is sturdy (for being resin). However, like always when it concerns resin there will always be the risk of it breaking in transit. I will do my best to ensure the miniature is well-protected when sending it to you to reduce this risk.\n\nCommunication \nI am dedicated to this project and will do my best to be reachable to answer any questions; both during and after the project ends. Of course, there will always be the risk that something unforeseen occurs on a personal level but as long as everything proceeds as expected, you can trust in easy and fast access to me with any and all your inquiries.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #18", "update_userinfo": "Kickstarter #6 now LIVE!", "update_content": "On this date a year ago this project was successfully funded!

JibbyVideos have done a spectacular job making this video showing what the Shenmue series is all about. \nIf you were not around in 1999 when Shenmue first came out, or did not have the opportunity to play it if you were, you may have missed this game which has gone on to win the hearts of gamers everywhere, and influenced so many games to come after it.\nMaking his way from Japan to China on a quest to avenge his father, Ryo Hazuki grows from boy to man, encountering new friends, and foes alike, as he completes his Kung-fu training.\nTons of mini games were just one of the features that made the sandbox world of Shenmue so enjoyable. Shenmue defied all convention and created the genre that later came to be known as \"open world.\"  An unparalleled level of freedom let you chose how you wanted to play.\nFirst of its kind realism, an immersive story, and not to mention, the birth of the QTE , made Shenmue a one-of-a-kind experience and an instant classic. \nShenmue 3 is the true sequel to the classic open world action RPG games, Shenmue and Shenmue 2. Created for modern platforms (PC and PlayStation 4) and built in Unreal 4, Shenmue 3 will continue the legacy of Shenmue.\nWith your help, we can #SaveShenmue and rejoin Ryo and our favorite characters on this new adventure!\nAll images on the Kickstarter page are a work in progress.\nShenmue 3 will have familiar elements from its predecessors and new fight mechanics to achieve a new level of interactive storytelling. \nIf this project reaches its funding goal, Shenmue 3 will be available on the PS4 and PC. \nOur ambition is to deliver a Shenmue experience that will draw in newcomers to the series and reward diehard fans with its deep story and rich gameplay.\n14 years of planning and ideas from one of the greatest game designers of all time\u2026 darn right, there are Stretch Goals! Could these Stretch Goals lead this next Shenmue to change the way we play games again? You know they can. But we can't add Stretch Goals after the game is on shelves.\nThe more we can raise during this campaign, the more Shenmue 3 will come alive. Together, we can make it happen. Together, we can make a Shenmue that surpasses even the originals!\n Area Stretch Goal Explanation \nWhere we left off... Ryo Hazuki has made his way to China in search of his father\u2019s killer. There he meets a new travelling companion, Shenhua, and learns of a legend from her village that has foretold their path together. \nThe story continues as Ryo and Shenhua start off on a new journey that will take them farther into enemy territory, deeper into mystery, and ever closer to their destiny. \nWill the mystery of the mirrors be revealed? How is Ryo\u2019s father connected to all of this? Will Ryo track down the Chi You Men cartel and face Lan Di in a final showdown?\nSince the release of Shenmue 2, now 14 years ago, I have been greeted by the passionate outpouring of dedicated fans and Shenmue community members wherever I go. They all want to know one thing: \"When will Shenmue 3 be coming out?\" With the advent of games using Kickstarter during these past few years, the new and now frequent demand from the fans has been, \u201cDo a Kickstarter for Shenmue 3!\u201d \nIf Shenmue 3 was going to get made, I wanted to make it with the fans. Through Kickstarter, I knew that could happen. Together, with Shenmue fans everywhere, I knew we could build the game that the series deserves.\nIf we do not reach our funding goal, Shenmue 3 will not go forward. I know that the goal of making Shenmue 3 with the fans, and seeing Shenmue in the hands of gamers all around the world is a lofty one. We are balancing our ambitions for a grand sequel with the pragmatic realities of developing a game of this scale. It will not be easy, but I have dreamed of making this sequel for 14 years \u2013 it is time to bring Shenmue back! And to make it come true, it will need the love and support from each and every one of you!\nSo please join us in making Shenmue 3 \u2013 let us grow our community and build a new, exciting Shenmue experience!\nRyo - On a journey to avenge his father.\nShenhua - Raised among the forests of China.\nLan Di - Coldblooded boss of the shadowy Chi You Men.\nNiao Sun - Deadly siren of the Chi You Men\nA pioneer in gaming entertainment for over three decades, He has cemented a place in history for his visionary work.

After learning of Kickstarter, I knew it would be possible to get Shenmue 3 started. Wanting to make the best game possible, I also knew that I would have to look to more traditional means to obtain all the funds that would be needed to create the game I had envisioned. \nI can say that with their assistance on the production and marketing end, and in Sony\u2019s case with some publishing support as well, Ys Net is able to use more of the money we collect through Kickstarter purely for Shenmue 3\u2019s development. It is also important to note that your funds are going strictly to Ys Net for development of Shenmue 3 \u2013 Sony and Shibuya Productions are not seeing a cent of your Kickstarter dollars.\n- Yu Suzuki", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRisk and challenge are two words that have been with Shenmue 3 for the past 14 years. In fact, Shenmue has always been about risk and challenge. This time will be no different. \n\nThe real challenge now is to deliver a sequel that we will all be satisfied with after 14 years of waiting. After much research and planning, we set the funding goal at this level believing it will make possible a fulfilling Shenmue experience.\n\nWith regards to development of the game, we have an experienced team, deeply connected with the Shenmue franchise. With modern tools, experienced professionals, and the community of Shenmue by our sides, we have set ourselves up for success.\n\nWe will do our absolute best to deliver Shenmue 3 and the rewards by their respective deadlines. However, there is always the possibility that problems may arise which could affect reward delivery. There may end up being changes in game or reward designs. We may press right when we are supposed to press left and get hilariously head butted and kneed in the groin. \n\nIn these situations, the whole Shenmue 3 team promises to keep you updated and informed on the game development and reward delivery progress. We are all very excited, ambitious, and optimistic that we have prepared well, and are ready for the challenges that are ahead of us.\n\nRyo and Shenhua are not out of the woods yet, so we ask for your ongoing support.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #134", "update_userinfo": "Steam Activation Walkthrough & Version Update Notice", "update_content": "\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u306f\u3053\u3061\u3089\n\nHello Everyone,\nSteam codes are almost ready and will be available soon through your survey.

Taken from within our Shattered Void Universe that we have spent 3 years developing and building on. While we are working on Shattered Void, a fast-paced space dog fighting game, We wanted to explore some other areas of the universe and with what better way but some ground forces? So your first question comes to mind.....\nThe Marine Tactical Unit are the frontline soldiers of the Earth Exploration Fleet in the Shattered Void universe which we at White Dragon Miniatures are currently creating. \nThe Marines are the true boots on the ground, working with modern tech and trained in advance warfare for FIBUA (fighting in built up areas) and ship boarding actions. They operate in small teams of 6 men per section, and 18 men in a multiple. They are able to quickly improvise, adapt and overcome whatever the task issued.  \nEach Multiple of marines are assigned an Armadillo Support Bot, able to carry heavy equipment without effort and also carrying one of 3 support guns (Chain cannon, Grenade Launcher and Missile Launcher). It also features a large armoured plate on one side, able to protect soldiers using it as cover in exposed areas. The armoured plate features a reactive armour shield while the Armadillo provides the squad much needed covering fire with their choice of weapon turret and finally as a resupply and communications hub.  \nFinally the Proteus Frontline Battle Mech is one of the main spearhead unit available to the MTU forces. Carrying huge calibre weapons in its arms and thick armour that can with stand some severe punishment, they march across the battlefield bringing destruction and ruin to their opposition.\n                                                                                                                     \nThe finished miniatures will be cast in highly detailed polyurethane resin, manufactured by Prodos Games Ltd. \nBased on past experience (of us and others), we will be charging shipping after the Kickstarter concludes based on the actual costs incurred to ship. We will collect this via our pledge manager after the campaign ends. This is so we can be fair to all our backers (shipping is rarely one size fits all).  As a rough estimate, the pledges will cost about \u00a34 within the UK, \u00a35 within Europe and between \u00a36-8 elsewhere (for a 1kg parcel), but this may increase or decrease depending on the quantity of stretch goals we unlock and your choices. Thank you for your understanding.\nWe at White Dragon Miniatures wish to bring our exciting new 15mm sci-fi range into production but we need your help to do it! The aim of this Kickstarter is to allow the highly anticipated Earth Exploration Fleet Marine Tactical Unit (EEF MTU) to hot-drop onto your table top battlefields. The EEF MTU range is composed of 18 individual infantry miniatures, 1 Armadillo Support Bot and the mighty Proteus Frontline Battle Mech. \nWe would also love to thanks contributors to the project and their artist talents that have really helped make this project. They are (in no order)\nFrancesco Pizzo (sculptor of the MTU marines and Proteus FLBM)\nKasim Lewis (concept artist of the MTU, Proteus, Talos and Strix and artist of the top artwork)\nAnthony Scroggins (concept artist for the Armadillo)\nAlex Immerzeel (sculptor of the Armadillo and Fiddler Mech)\nAlexander Iglesias (concept artist of the Fiddler Mech)\nEdon Guraziu (artist for the 'riots in the slums' artwork)\nAdam Rogers (sculptor of the Talos suit)\nMark Stone (Right hand man, PR & Marketing)", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhile every effort has been made prior to the Kickstarter going ahead to ensure that everything runs smoothly, with having all the models conceptualised, sculpted, printed and production casts done.

Now - not only is his first artbook coming in English for the first time - with your help, we will publish a brand new second book as well, continuing his amazing story. \nWith this Kickstarter we are seeking funds for two lavishly produced art books with homegrown sci-fi from Sweden. These are:\nBook One: Tales from The Loop\nBook Two: Swedish Machines, Lonely Places\nThe first Tales from The Loop book was released on the Swedish Book Fair in September 2014 and was an instant success. The book contained the full first set of paintings from The Loop, the enormous particle accelerator hidden beneath the pastoral Swedish countryside, as well as a score of short stories chronicling life in the shadow of the machines. For the first time the deep and layered setting behind Simon's paintings were available to the public. And soon, thanks to your help, this book will be available to the international English speaking audience.\nBut with this Kickstarter we are seeking funds for publishing not only one, but two beautifully crafted art books schock full with Simon St\u00e5lenhag's paintings and stories. The first book is translated, layouted and ready to be sent to the printers. The second book, with the working title Swedish Machines, Lonely Places is in development, Simon has done roughly half of the new paintings and we are planning for a late 2016 release for this one.\nHere are some reviews of the Swedish edition:\n\"My Life as a Dog mixed with Transformers... absolutely brilliant.\"  \n\u2013 SVT (Swedish national television)\n\u201cOne of my greatest fantasy and cultural experiences during the 2000\u2019s, maybe ever.

The central location is the countryside of M\u00e4lar\u00f6arna, a string of islands and half islands just west of Stockholm. The background is this:\nIn the 1950s, the Swedish government orders the construction of a large particle accelerator. The state agency RIKSENERGI is tasked with developing this massive project. In 1969 the The Facility For Research In High Energy Physics is ready, located deep below the pastoral M\u00e4lar\u00f6arna-countryside. The local population soon calls it THE LOOP.\nFrom it's inception to it's closure in 1994, The Loop was the largest accelerator in the world. The thousands of staff: scientists, engineers and maintenance workers, all serve Riksenergi during these years \u2013 and makes possible tremendous scientific advances. But the power of the Gravitron, the heart of the accelerator, proves difficult to control. The side effects of the project are dramatic. Strange sightings and bizarre rumours taints the scientific image of The Loop.\nIn the shadow of the weird machines filling the countryside, life continues as normal. The kids of M\u00e4lar\u00f6arna grew up living above the technological marvel of The Loop, but for them it was just a part of their very ordinary lives. Until strange beasts from another time showed up, that is.\nThe Gauss freighters \u2013 painting from Book One.\nInvasive species \u2013 painting from Book One.\nThe Fire Guards \u2013 painting from Book One.\nThe Vagabond \u2013 painting from Book Two.\nMissing person, Karasuendo \u2013 painting from Book Two.\nHacking The Loop \u2013 painting from Book Two.\nYou can see a lot more of Simon's paintings at his Tumbr or website. Go have a look!\nSimon St\u00e5lenhag \u2013 Photo: Mariette Svensson\nSwedish artist Simon St\u00e5lenhag burst onto the art scene in 2013 when his first series of paintings were shared on the Internet. His original blend of naturalistic landscape paintings with science fiction elements and a very low key recollection of growing up in the eighties struck a chord. Not just in Sweden, but all over the world. The Verge, Wired, IO9, Scientific American and The Guardian have all praised his work. But until late 2014, the only place you could watch his art was in digital form on the Internet.\nBased in Stockholm, Sweden, Simon uploaded his first digital paintings onto the Internet in 2013, since then he has become something of a phenomena in the art and sci-fi communities. Simon shares his time between a small cabin at M\u00e4lar\u00f6arna (the setting that inspires his work) and an apartment in Stockholm.\nInterviews and other stuff:\nImagining a dystopian Sweden full of robots and dinosaurs\n \u2013 Wired\nChildhood of Tomorrow\n \u2013 Scientific American\nLa Maison WERTN\nDecember 1994 \u2013 painting from Book Two.\nThere is more than just the books!

Please be advised that if you order both books, we will charge you for shipping twice as the later book will be shipped in 2016. Shipping is always tricky as rates differ and change over time but we estimate that it will cost 10 USD within the US and the UK, and 15 USD to the rest of the world.\nBut will not shipping be super expensive as you are located in Sweden?\nNo! We are working with Shipwire for this Kickstarter and will have fulfilment centers in the US and UK. That means that we offer domestic shipping rates within these countries, and shipping to other countries will be from the closest fulfilment center.\nHey! I just bought the Swedish version and paid a lot for shipping across the world... \nWe hear you. Let us know and we will pay for shipping of book one, regardless of which edition you choose.\nWhat is the format of the books? \nThe books will have a 280 x 250 mm landscape format.\nWhat is the page count?\n128 pages for Book One. It is too early to say what the exact page count will be for Book Two but it will be in the same ball park.\nWhat kind of quality can I expect the books to have? \nBoth books will be printed at our printer of choice who are specialized in premium grade art books. This is the same printer that most major publishing houses in Sweden use for top quality art books. Both editions of the books will have hardcovers, clothed spines and be printed on sturdy 170 g semi-matte, fully coated Arctic Volume White paper.\nWill the books be available in book stores?\nWe will most likely team up with an international distributor so that the books will find their way to retail stores in US and UK. However, that is beyond the scope of this Kickstarter. The Limited edition will not be sold through retail stores.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhen it comes to any Kickstarter project shipping and logistics is a challenge.

Well, community is SUPER important to us. Our Facebook group is HUGELY active, we try to meet as many players as we can, our Tournament scene is growing fast AND we release tonnes of Lore completely free of charge to ensure that Lords of War feels as full and rounded as it can be.\nWe know that mums and dads out there read our Lore to their children at bed time. How do we know? Because they have told us, and it's something we are REALLY proud of.\nPlus, this our third Kickstarter campaign, with our previous campaigns having been delivered in a few short months to lots of happy customers - we will NOT let you down!\nWe have worked REALLY hard to keep Lords of War compact, but you can expand the game to an epic scale if you want to.\nTo see how the game looks and works during a standard game then check out the Let's Play Lords of War: Elves versus Lizardmen video above or check out the VERY FIRST unboxing video which we recorded with prototype cards back in November 2012!\nThe key things to remember is that this isn't any kind of card game you've played before. It's NOT that mini-game from Final Fantasy VIII, it's NOT another Magic: The Gathering clone, and it's DEFINITELY not Summoner Wars.\nAll of those games are obviously awesome in their own right, but when you pick up Lords of War you are picking up something truly unique.\nMoreover, we are regular people with full time jobs who have made this game because nothing out there quite hit the spot for us.\nWe wanted a game that was SUPER easy to learn but which offers a LOT more than the big LCGs, CCGs and TCGs already out there, and Lords of War does just that.\nAside from winning the UK Games Expo Award for Best Strategic Card Game, Lords of War has been widely critically acclaimed.\nBelow we have included a number of testimonial quotes from reviews, as well as video reviews from several online magazines and reviewers:\n\"This is a great game that is perfect for first timers or hard-core gamers because of the rules, the design, the art and the fun factor. 5/5\"\n- The Geek Syndicate\n\"Plenty of tactical depth and oodles of replay value... I can quite honestly say this is one of the best-looking games you'll ever play.\"\n- Beasts of War\n\"I cannot recommend this game enough. There is a lot of depth to it and by adding in the Terrain and Weather cards you get the feel of a proper tabletop war game without the cost.\"\n- Fanplastic Little Men\n\"For me, Lords of War has provided many hours of enjoyment and continues to do so every time it is played. Monkeys With Fire highly recommends this game!\"\n- Monkeys With Fire\n\"Lords of War is a really great game and it doesn't matter whether you're a seasoned card shark or totally new to gaming. The mechanics are simple enough to learn it quickly but the strategy is complex enough to make you want to play again and again.\"\n- No Pun Included\n\"Lords of War is shaping up to be one of the best games of the year and is just starting its journey; I suggest you get on board.\"\n- Polyhedron Collider\n\"It demands a lot more thought than some games ten times the size and four times the price, but one thing you won\u2019t need to consider is whether to grab a copy or not \u2013 your answer should be a simple yes.\"\n- The Little Metal Dog Show\n\"Lords of War absolutely SHINES at what it is trying to be. The design is tight and the restraint shown to keep it simple and fast playing is to be commended.\"\n- Boardgames in Blighty\n\"There's really quite a lot to the strategy of Lords of War, even though it is pretty simple to learn. It doesn't take long. Definitely check it out. It's a fantastic game.\"\n- How Lou Sees It\nHere's a video review from GMS Magazine:\n Here's another one from Board To Death:\n And here's one from How Lou Sees It:\nThese are the things we've made to date...\nThe Lords of War \"core\" games come packaged in double-deck packs which contain two Fantasy armies illustrated by the amazing Steve Cox (Danger Mouse, Count Duckula, Roland Rat).\nAll of our decks are cross-compatible, which means you can play all the factions against one another, with each army requiring a different play-style.\nAlternatively, can actually blend the decks together using our Ranking System to deck-build a Mercenary Army that plays exactly how you want it to, without the deck becoming overpowered.\nPLUS - with the Lords of War: Magic and Monsters Expansion Packs, you can expand the Core Game to include new Unit Types in your games including new Flying Units, Monstrous Creatures and Magic Units.\nYou can ALSO add more decks to Lords of War to increase the player count and, with The Lords of War: Weather and Terrain Expansion Pack you can experiment with two new game modes.\nOooooh! Terrain Cards!!!\nOn the one hand, you can also play the Lords of War: Terrain pre-building game to create your own custom battlefields and/or you can play with the Lords of War: Weather deck to make your battles (and the game's rules) dynamically change as battles go along!\nOooooh! Weather Cards!!!\nWe have worked as hard as we can to make it as easy as possible to support Lords of War - no matter where in the world you live!\nTo support us, you must first SELECT THE RIGHT PLEDGE LEVEL for you by picking one of the REWARD OPTIONS from the right hand side of the page.\nBut don't click that Pledge Level quite yet!\nNOTE: THERE ARE NO HIDDEN OR ADDITIONAL SHIPPING COSTS FOR THIS CAMPAIGN!\nYou should SECONDLY calculate the cost of any of our additional ADD-ONS (see the details below) some of which are Kickstarter Exclusive.\nFinally, you should then calculate the TOTAL COST of your Pledge, click the correct Pledge Level for you, and then enter the right amount for that Pledge Level PLUS any of the Add-Ons you have selected.\nOnce the campaign is over, and provided we fund (oh man, we hope we fund...) NICK WILL THEN MESSAGE YOU TO CONFIRM THE EXACT DETAILS OF YOUR ORDER.\nSimples.\nOther than that, please, PLEASE SHARE the campaign - we are a tiny company and need EVERYONE to pitch in and help spread the word!!!\nNOTE: ALL STRETCH GOALS ARE INCLUDED IN THE PLEDGE LEVELS - SERIOUSLY, LIKE WE SAID BEFORE, THERE ARE NO HIDDEN OR ADDITIONAL COSTS!\nThe Lords of War World Map... there's plenty of places we would like to take you!\nIn our previous campaigns we have kind of messed up with our Stretch Goals by... not including them!\nThis time though, we're going in ALL GUNS BLAZING!!!\nNOTE: All Stretch Goals go to ALL \u00a310+ Backers!\nThat beggars the question as to what we have planned though. \nWell, how about:\nAt 250 Backers we unlocked...\nBrrum brrrum brrrrrrum! Hop, hop. Brrrruum!!!\nAs soon as we cleared 250 Backers, EVERYONE who backs the campaign at the 'Give Me The New Thing' Level or above will get Kickstarter Exclusive General \"The Easter Bunny\" (who is obviously REALLY angry that we didn't launch the campaign in March...)\nHave you backed at \u00a310+? In which case, HE'S YOURS!\nAnd at \u00a310,000 we unlocked...\nGoing to EVERY \u00a310+ Backer!!!\nThen, at \u00a311,000 we unlocked:\nAdd additional copies of this Booster for \u00a32!!!\nAnd at \u00a312,000 we unlocked:\nAgain, add \u00a32 for ADDITIONAL copies of this Booster!\nAnd at \u00a313,000 we unlocked:\nYet again, to add EXTRA copies of this, add \u00a32 to your pledge!\nAND at \u00a314,000 we unlocked:\nAt \u00a315,000 every \u00a310+ Backer ALSO got THIS!\nAnd at \u00a316,000 every \u00a310+ Backer ALSO got THIS!!!\nAdd \u00a32 for additional copies of ANY BOOSTERS!!!\nAnd with YOUR support there's more Stretch Goals to come!\nAt 500 Backers!\nIncluding the Infantry, Ranger, Spear, Cavalry, Berserker AND General symbols!!!\nWith another Backer Goal yet to be revealed at 750 Backers!\nWe have 3 types of Add-On available in this campaign:\nExtra Double Decks\nAccessories\nShiny Card Sets.\nHere is a breakdown of costs:\nLords of War: Orcs versus Dwarves\nLords of War: Orcs versus Dwarves is the original award-winning Lords of War pack. As with all Lords of War core decks, the game is playable out of the box and contains two complete armies - the Orcs and the Dwarves.\nThe Dwarves are a feisty race full of guts and rebellious tendencies. As a Faction in Lords of War, they are a great place to start, benefitting from fair amounts of defence, a balance of different card types and attacks that pack a lot of punch.\nThe Orcs meanwhile are a pretty foul and rowdy bunch. As a Lords of War Faction, they are all about sneaky attacks in which they deal tonnes of damage \u2013 and they actively enjoy sacrificing lots of Goblins along the way\u2026\nLords of War: Elves versus Lizardmen\nLike its predecessor Lords of War: Orcs versus Dwarves, Lords of War: Elves versus Lizardmen is a dual-deck strategic card game for two-plus players. It won the UK Games Expo Award for Best Strategic Card Game in 2013, the year of its release.\nIn terms of how they play, the Elves' deadly Archer and Cavalry Units form an exciting play style which is all about flexibility, light armour and cunning.\nAs for the Lizardmen, they are a wild and wily collection of vicious, cold-blooded beasts. Brightly coloured and extremely eye-catching, playing Lizardmen can often require some sleight of hand...\nLords of War: Templars versus Undead\nThe third in the Lords of War: Fantasy Battles series, Lords of War: Templars versus Undead was funded on Kickstarter and was released in May 2014. It was a nominee for the UK Games Expo Award for Best Expansion Pack last year, along with The Lords of War: Weather and Terrain Expansion Pack.\nAs for play styles, the Templars are a great deck for beginners. They are tough as old boots and have plenty of card-types which deal heavy damage!\nThe Undead meanwhile are gruesome, mean and cold to the touch, providing an awesome combination of multi-directional attacking cards, Moving Units and deadly Cavalry.\nLords of War: Orcs versus Dwarves 2 - The Magic and Monsters Expansion Pack\nThis game-changing expansion was brought into existence at the end of last year by our AMAZING Kickstarter supporters.\nAs well as expanding Army Decks to 54 cards, this expansion introduced new rules, units, unique spells and special abilities to the the Orcs and the Dwarves, including Fire and Ice-themed magic spells and LOTS more!\nLords of War: Elves versus Lizardmen 2 - The Magic and Monsters Expansion Pack\nThis is the reason we need your support - we are trying to fund this brand new expansion pack with this campaign. so please spread the word. Every penny matters!\nLike the previous Magic and Monsters Expansion Pack, this set will expand the Elves and Lizardmen decks to 54 cards while introducing new rules, units, unique spells and special abilities to the game, including Air and Poison-themed magic spells...\nHello there, new things!\n\nHere we have 4 Spells. On the left, the Elves have the blue shimmery ones while the Lizardmen have the freaky, psychedelic ones.\nThe Elves spells are:\nBless\n(The top left symbol) - When an Elven Mage Unit casts Bless, he casts a token onto an allied Ranged Unit. That Bless token enables that Ranged Unit to either Fire Twice in one turn or Fire Once even if engaged by an enemy Unit.\nPoison\n(The top right symbol) - When a Lizardmen Mage Unit casts Poison, they infect one enemy for 1 Damage. Once that enemy dies, that Poison spreads to all of their allied Units along any connecting Attack Arrows.\nAir Damage\n(The bottom left symbol) - When an Elven Mage Unit casts Air Damage, that Mage leaves 1 Air Damage token on an enemy card, effectively reducing their Shield Value by 1. Air Damage can be stacked and, like all Spells, can target Flying Units.\nParalyze\n(The bottom right symbol) - When a Lizardmen Mage Unit casts Paralyze, they effectively immobilize an enemy card. The Spell prevents that card from Moving (even via Berserking) or Retreating. \nAs was the case with the Orcs and Dwarves, the Elves and Lizardmen can cancel out or 'Cure' each others' Spells - HOWEVER - Orc and Dwarf spells cannot be cured by the Elves or the Lizardmen, and vice versa...\nAccessory Add Ons!\nThe Lords of War Custom Deck Card Tin!\nPerfectly sized to fit a fully expanded and sleeved custom Lords of War deck PLUS your Spell Tokens!

With no signal and lost communication, NASA believed the astronauts were lost forever. They declared the mission a tragic lost and announced the names of those on board. One of those astronauts was Dane Quaid\u2019s brother, Daniel. Quaid refused to accept this. So he asked NASA to coordinate a search and rescue team to find his brother and the rest of the crew. They declined. Desperate to find his brother, Quaid enlisted the help from his father James Quaid, retired space marine; his girlfriend, Casey Hathaway, technologist and long time friend, Bill Richards, weapon specialist. Together they hijacked one of NASA\u2019s most advanced space shuttles.

At Wamp we have some of the worlds finest artists rubbing shoulders with beginners.\nIt has long been a dream to add more to the community and creating our own brush range is something we have thought about for a long while.\nDetail Brush\nThe Brushes\nSo we have created the Select Range. A set of high quality brushes that use the finest materials. Each brush designed for a specific task and labelled for quick and easy identification. No more wondering what size for what job! This makes it easy for beginners to utilise the range. Afterall a good brush is a great way to improve your painting. Likewise expert painters will appreciate the Pure Kolinsky Sable used for the bristles, the best material you can buy.\nOur brushes are designed to cover a whole host of tasks with brushes for blending, freehand, lining and more.\nThese brushes are hand-made especially for us in the UK by a world renowned brush making company. When we looked for a manufacturer to help produce these we were determined to use the best not the cheapest.\nWhat we wanted to do was create a simple concise range of paintbrushes that a beginner could pick up and use without confusion over sizes and what's best for what job. But alongside that, we also wanted these brushes to be the best quality you can get. A good brush is as helpful to a novice as to an expert painter.\nEach brush has been specifically tailored towards a certain technique but they are also adapatable enough to be used how you want. Just because we call something a vehicle brush doesn't mean you can't use it for something else if that's what suits your painting style. We each have different desires in terms of what brushes we use but we hope we have created a range that is broad enough for all tastes.\nThe range comprises of 8 brushes. The first four will fill the Starter Set and are the core brushes.\nFine Detail\nEquivalent to a Size 0. A very sharp tapered point makes this ideal for really small details such as eyes. The bristles are slightly longer than some other brushes allowing for better flow that gives greater precision precisely when its needed.\nDetail\nEquivalent to a size 1, this is the main workhorse brush. Its larger size over the Fine Detail allows it to be utilised not only for detail work but for blending applications. Once again a fine point coupled with slightly longer bristles allows the brush to offer great control.\nBasecoat\nEquivalent to a size 3, the Basecoat brush is a larger size that allows quick and easy basecoating. The bristles are slightly more rounded and shorter than the detail brushes. Many painters may also utilise this as a second brush when doing two-brush blending.\nFreehand\nEquivalent to a size 0, the freehand brush features extra long and thin bristle arrangement that is perfect for smooth thin strokes that are required for detailed freehand work.\nAs well as the core set we have a further four brushes available (these can be combined with the core four as part of the Premium or Superior ranges).\nLarge Basecoat\nEquivialent to a size 4, this large size brush is great for applying large swathes of basecoat quickly but still features a great point to allow for precise work.\nVehicle Brush\nEquivalent to a size 6, this is the largest brush we produce. It is aimed towards larger scale projects such as scenery or large vehicles.\nLiner\nEquivalent to a size 2/0, this small brush is designed for lining work. Its extra long bristles allow for long smooth flowing brush strokes. If you are after long thin lines on the edges of freehand then this is the perfect brush.\nFine Freehand\nEquivalent to a size 2/0. This is a small sized brush but it has been given a conical shape bristle with a fine tapered point. This allows extra fine precision work but the reservoir holds more paint than equivalent sized brushes. This mean precise strokes can be applied without the worry of the paint running out mid-stroke.\nStipple Brush (Unlocked)\nThis brush is perfect for applying a stipple effect to your work, whether its adding texture to cloth, damp patches to brickwork or rust effects this is the brush for the job. The 1/8th\" head is perfect for getting into small areas like metal bolts. The head is made from stiff bristles (Not Kolinsky because that just wouldn't work!) with a slight angle so you can use a varying amount of the head to give precise control depending on your needs.\nTwo Brush Blending Set (Unlocked)\nThis pair of brushes is a rather unusual set up for most people but is the way Ali likes to work for Two Brush blending to achieve her stunning results and she is happy to put her name to this set.\nThe first brush (the one used to apply the paint) is a size 2 brush. with a rounded point this brush has a nice sized belly to hold plenty of paint giving you the freedom to apply in the quantity you want. the second brush in the set is a Filbert style. Equivalent to a size 2 the flat shape sets this brush apart from the usual blenders. Ali particularly likes this shape as it is perfect for blending to an edge\nBoth brushes are made from pure Kolinsky Sable.\nLarge Detail Brush (Unlocked)\nMade to the same design as the standard Detail Brush just in a larger size (Equivalent to a size 2) Once again made from pure Kolinsky Sable with a nice sharp point, this gives the same great accuracy but with a larger belly allowing for more paint volume giving a greater range on stroke length without worrying about running out of paint mid-stroke.\nFlat Brush (Unlocked)\nThis size 1 equivalent is perfect for angular edging work as well as other tasks\nAll our brushes feature the same superb quality Pure Kolinsky Sable bristles. Gloss finished wooden handles and Nickel Ferrules, The handle thickness and shape is designed to make the brushes light-weight and comfortable to hold even during long painting sessions. A must for commission painters and display painters alike!\nBut what are they really like?\nIt's easy to go around making big claims about how these brushes are the greatest in the world and simply using them will turn you into a painting god and enable you to shoot rainbows from your nostrils. Rather than take our word for it, why not hear from some world renowned painters who have used the brushes themselves.\nGary Devereaux\n Golden Demon UK 2010 \u2013 Silver\n\u201cI used the brush on my Gandalf model completed recently and am really pleased with the results!\u201d\n\u201cWill certainly continue to use the brush that's for sure.'\u201d\nGandalf by Gary Devereaux\nScott Hockley\nGolden Demon UK 2009 - Bronze 40k Unit\nSalute 2010, 2011 \u2013 2nd place\nWamp 2011 \u2013 Best in Show\nEuro Militaire \u2013 3 Silver and 1 Bronze\n\"I've been using the new Wamp Detail brush for the last few weeks and I find it ideal for blending and glazing small areas, plus the nice sharp point is of course good for detail.\nThe quality of the Kolinsky Sable is just what I would expect and it keeps a good point too. It is already a regular in my \"go to\" set of brushes.\"\nYsala & The Darkness by Scott Hockley\n John Keys\nEuro Militaire - Gold Fantasy Bust.\nWorld Expo - Bronze Historic Master.\nSalute - 2nd Large scale.\nMonte San Savino - Silver Master Fantasy Figure.\n\"As we know using the right brush for the paint job at hand is a make or break matter. The wrong brush makes you swear, sweat and ultimately leads to a poor result. You wonder if you're doing something wrong questioning yourself throughout. But get the right brush and those thoughts melts away, the application is smooth and fully controllable - even for the tiniest details.\nI've been using the Wamp detail brush for my paint job on the Infamy miniatures Alucard figure and also on the weapon on the Afghan Tribesman from Grenadier Miniatures. In other words two very different uses, one highly detailed where careful application is required, the other larger smooth areas of wood where controlled and smooth application is needed. I can say from my experience this is the right brush for the job!\nThe quality is high throughout, from the gloss paint job through to the metalwork and bristles. It's kept a sharp point during the time I've been using it and has given me confidence in its use. The length and size of body of the bristles are very comfortable for me providing great control and whilst holding plenty of paint.\nUltimately I've enjoyed using this brush and have no qualms in recommending it for painters of any level.\"\nAfghan Tribesman by John Keys\nBen Jarvis\nGDUK 2008 40K single mini - Silver,\nGDUK 2008 40K vehicle - Gold,\nGDUK 2009 WH single mini - Gold,\nGDUK 2009 UK Slayer Sword Winner\nSalute 2013 Sci Fi single mini - Second Place\n\"The Wamp brushes are great, top quality, feel great and hold a fine point, what more can you want from a miniature painting brush?\"\n \"I love the sample brush I got to try out, it's bigger than I'd normally use but holds a point so well that it's capable of really fine freehand work, I'm NOT giving it back!\"\n \"I've tried a lot of brushes over the last decade and I have to say the sample Wamp brush I got to try out is among the very best. It holds it shape, keeps a fine point and feels great to use. Some brushes just feel right... this is one of those brushes.\"\nThe Clockmaker by Ben Jarvis\nExtras\nWhile this is purposefully a very simple kickstarter we also wanted to offer a few items to compliment the brush set. to this end we have four additional items you can add to your pledge to help you even more.\nBrush Case\nBrush Case\nBrush case internal (Brushes not included!)\nThis rigid case from Daler Rowney features 12 pockets. This is a great way to protect your brushes either at home or while travelling.\nBamboo Roll\nBamboo Roll (Brushes not included)\nThese ever popular rolls are a simple but effective way to transport and protect your brushes. Featuring 10 pockets it rolls up into an easy to carry size keeping your brushes tightly packed.\nThe Masters Brush Cleaner\nRegarded by many as THE best brush soap around. This 1oz tub will last an age and is the best way to prolong the life of your brushes. It can be used both as a soap or as a conditioner.\nMasters Brush Cleaner\n Wamp Workshop\nIf you really want to take your painting up a level then this is for you. We are offering the chance to receive two days of hands-on personal tuition from two of the painters featured in this very Kickstarter. Scott Hockley and John Keys are renowned UK painters winning numerous awards between them and both experienced in delivering first class workshops. Each day you will spend with one of the tutors learning great techniques such as weathering, NMM, OSL and colour theory. You will also receive a miniature from the weekend and follow up advice after the event that allows you to go home and try things out and get follow up help meaning you can iron out any problems you may encounter.\nThe workshop will take place one weekend later in the year in the South East/Midlands area of the UK (the location and date will be confirmed later)\nThe Workshop is only available as part of the Ultimate pledge and the price includes a complete set of brushes, the brush soap and either a brush roll or case. Places are limited for the workshop.\n(Please note the price includes Workshop Ticket, Brush package, miniature and paint.

A dangerous recluse exiled by his Lunar brethren for his command of the esoteric.You can also add additional Trevors for \u00a37!\nWith the exception of 'Free Radical', pledges involve a selection of miniature sets known as 'Posse Packs', a copy of the rule book and a deck of M.A.D cards. This will equip you with everything you need to start playing Wasteman, though you may supplement your pledge with as many 'add ons' as you would like. Simply add the cost of these to your pledge. Shortly after the campaign is complete there will be a survey form to let me know what you have chosen.      \nEvery pledge will now also receive a digital download of the Wasteman original soundtrack!\nPlease note that any scenery pictured is done so for display purposes only and is not included unless specifically stated otherwise.\nWasteman is a fun, easy to learn, and refreshingly crazy game! Players or 'comrades' control syndicates, typically comprised of between 5 and 20 ruthless denizens of the wastes, in an attempt to vanquish their opponent, survive bizarre encounters and/or capture much needed supplies.\nPacked with gorgeous illustrations, loads of background and all the rules to play Wasteman, the full colour, perfect bound rulebook comes complete with a full deck of M.A.D cards. Select as part of your pledge, or add additional sets for \u00a322.\nClick to download the game overview PDF!\nDuring a game of Wasteman, comrades take it turn to activate individual figures to perform several actions; such as attacking, moving, hiding or even bringing people back to life with the power of their mind in some cases! Figures can normally only be activated once per turn so you have real scope for strategy \u2013 goad your opponent into activating the wrong figure at the wrong time and they could be left open to all sorts of cunning shenanigans!\nOnce a syndicate drops below 5 figures they become desperate and the restriction for activating a figure only once in a turn is lifted. This leads to some really cinematic moments, where often lone survivors hopelessly attempt to fend off hordes of enemies and occasionally succeed! This really keeps the game fun right until the last man.\nFigures take different kinds of damage \u2013 they can be spooked, crippled, seriously injured, or killed outright. To make it easier to remember what\u2019s happened, each figure comes with a base equipped with slots and removable tokens. These are cast in high quality resin and are included with all but the largest figures. Each figure will receive 1 base out of 10 designs selected at random.\nM.A.D cards really bring the crazy to the game! Each comrade receives a hand of 5 M.A.D cards that can be played at any time (for the most part) to either help yourself or hinder your opponent. There\u2019s nothing quite like having the enemy boss abducted by aliens just before riding a conveniently timed tornado to the objective on the last turn! Though normally limited to 5 cards, you can seek the aid of traders or vending machines to top up your hand during a game leading to some very tense moment as your prize fighter sits in the middle of the battlefield kicking a coffee machine.\nThe cards themselves are lavishly illustrated by yours truly, and beautifully printed on quality playing card stock.\nAs well as a myriad of rules for hazards, mods to alter the game and a stockpile of scenarios, Wasteman has an in depth syndicate creation system, with loads of equipment, skills and Boss Rosters to choose from. Although each figure comes with a stat card, you are more than welcome to create your own and/or combine figures from different posse packs \u2013 the choices are vast! \nStat cards are beautifully printed on quality playing card stock.\nPosse packs are your perfect start for a Wasteman Syndicate! They include all the figures, tokens and cards you need to get playing. Bear in mind that in Wasteman there are very few restrictions on what you can can include when creating your syndicate, so with six sets to choose from the combinations are vast!\n  Each set comes complete with:\n5x figures\n5x stat cards\n5x Token slot bases with tokens\n5x unique activation tokens\n2x 10 sided dice\nYou can select Posse Packs as part of your pledge, or add additional sets for \u00a320 each.\nActivation tokens come in the form of bottle caps and serve as a handy reminder of which figures have been activated during a game. Each posse pack comes with their own unique design!  \nFrom inter-dimensional monstrosities to titanic machines programmed to kill, the wastes are teaming with all kinds of creatures.\nYou may supplement your pledge with as many 'add ons' as you would like. Simply add the cost of these to your pledge.

I currently have plans for several expansions and concepts for enough figures to keep me busy for at least four years.  \nSide Note: What does 35mm scale look like?\nMy figures fit snugly with several other manufacturers such as Antimatter games, Warploque miniatures and Reaper miniatures. The 'regular' average humans are a little taller than some popular figure ranges, but generally not to the extent where they are incompatible.

The world is seamless. You\u2019ll walk into the Holloway-Exeter docking bay, board the Starr Wolf and control the flight sequence, blasting off to space. You\u2019ll be bargaining deals at the bar in order to afford repairs and upgrades to your Starr Wolf and using information gleaned from characters to find hidden routes while flying between destinations. Be careful which passing enemies you attack, as not all are foes, and a few could have dire consequences. Even while facing the charging death beam of a G'ell cannon, use your charisma to dodge bullets.\nOPEN-MIDDLED GAMEPLAY (OMG!)\nStarr Mazer is driven by an Open-Middled Gameplay (OMG!) narrative. An entire playthrough of the game is like a season of a show, but each episode within can appear in almost any order. These episodes all have many entry points and exit points, but the core content of each episode is meticulously crafted. We record not only how a player starts an episode, but the decisions that player makes within, and how that player decides to end it. Your actions modify situations and outcomes of future episodes. As you complete key episodes in the overall narrative, the scenarios start funneling into one of a few logical and satisfying endings influenced by your actions throughout.\nDYNAMIC SHMUP SEQUENCES\nYou'll spend a lot of time traveling between planets, asteroids, and space stations. Each time you do, the ride will reflect the state of the world. Are you flying through Tarsec sept-space as they meet a fleet of G'ell straight from depths of the Helix Nebula, or did you wait just a little longer and see scattered remnants of a great battle? Anger pirate groups and you\u2019ll be sure they\u2019ll find you, even in the most remote reaches of space.\nSHMUPs are known for their carefully crafted sequences that encourage you to perfect maneuvers. Starr Mazer will have the best of both worlds. The developers on the team are no strangers to dynamic AI. SHMUP segments will be generated from a vast collection of hand crafted encounters that can be modified dynamically in difficulty and scale, in addition to being layered on top of other encounters. You\u2019ll recognize tactics used by each group, as their history will provide a style in which they fly, fight, and chase.\nGUTS AND BUCKS\nBrick\u2019s been out of touch stuck in a sleep-lock pod for nearly a century and a half. His skills are rusty and his wallet empty. By taking missions from all sorts of shifty folk at the Holloway-Exeter station he\u2019ll earn bucks to buy gear and guts to increase his skills. This isn\u2019t just a system to make SHMUP parts easier or to give you more dialogue options in the Point-and-Click parts. This is a way to customize Brick to play as you want. Use items to influence major characters. Upgrade the Starr Wolf into a dominating fighting fortress, or use your guts to become an ace pilot and never scratch the paint.\nBRICK\u2019S STORY NEVER ENDS\nBecause of the power of the OMG! narrative, each time you play through Starr Mazer it will be a different experience. Maybe in your first playthrough it\u2019s not till the end that you meet Declination Jane, the galaxy\u2019s most powerful space lord, just after she finds peace between two warring clans. You win her over, and she provides help in your last few episodes. But in your next playthrough you meet her earlier, and catch her at a bad time when she\u2019s on the brink of war. Brick says the wrong thing at the wrong time and insights her furious wrath. Now every time you cross the BARATHA DIVIDE she makes sure to send you a gift of a battalion of warships to fight your way through.\nTHE UNIVERSE OF STARR MAZER\nThe galaxy is a cored out husk. It's one hundred and thirty years after THE GREAT WAR and any hope of unity, peace and whatever else you could want that doesn't end with you dead went out of style with microwave ovens and heavy fuel oil.\nThe core systems are an impenetrable cabal of aristocratic solar-states and the badlands at their border, clear up to the BARATHA DIVIDE, are filled with pirates, prospectors, colonists and cowboys in ceramic-alloy mess makers.\nLittle bastions of hope are scattered among the detritus. Little societies spinning in oblong orbits with sticks pointed outward and hopes turned in hoping to make it another cycle without some mercenary band of space-pop trying to pound their way in.\nThe galaxy needs a hero.\nThe Holloway-Exeter Station\n\"Ain't nobody e'r left outta' Holloway richer'n 'ay came in. Aint' nobody came up inta' Holloway deader'n 'ay left.\" -- Supchup Tanglewarn, Space Pirate\nThe Holloway-Exeter is a frontier town packed into a spinning ringed cylinder orbiting the fourth moon of the third planet of a dying star; a great place for a mercenary pilot like Brick to find himself at the pointy end of some clatter and sin.\nA century worth of gentrification has built layer upon layer of complication and perturbation onto the small outpost Brick once knew. Now the rich line the outsides of seedy den within, and have no idea of the crusty society which lives deep within their walls.\nThe BARATHA DIVIDE\nThe BARATHA DIVIDE is that place you imagine you'll end up when you kick it if you spend your life kicking over lemonade stands and ripping tags off of mattresses. It's the big empty; a kind of black local space looks into and gets lost. It is the end of everything and the beginning of nothing. Some don't even think reality works out there. \nIt's also where the G'ell come from.\nThe Helix Nebula\nTearing a multi-dimensional rift smack dab in the middle of sea of conflict was the Helix Nebula. For some its arrival has been an inconvenience or a loss of wealth, spewing all manner of terrors and lost souls into the once corrupt but stable district this side of the DIVIDE. For others it\u2019s an omen of a greater prophecy, and the time of a new god. \nFor Brick it\u2019s one hell of a way to earn a few bucks from superstitious investors.\nThe G'ell\nThere is no other known race so perfectly bred for combat. The G'ell have learned from a history of violence and stepped up to survive at the brink of extinction. This single minded society holds a million year grudge that has turned a few pockets of the universe into suicide districts.\nThe G'ell are a race of meticulous mathematicians, incorporating advanced calculus into every shot. Their attack patterns would look beautiful if you weren\u2019t stuck in the middle of a parabolic demise.\nBrick M. Stonewood\nBrick M. Stonewood (the \u201cM\u201d stands for \u201cMetal\u201d) is a remnant of an older time. A time where men were men and truth spilled at 60km/s from the barrel of a gun. Found by ingot miners in sleep-lock, drifting in a LOKATT MkII DSP eject pod and revived at the Holloway-Exeter Station, Brick is a man driven to unlock the secrets of his past and the strange mysteries that lie just beyond the DIVIDE; a specialist with a ceramic alloy steed, the Starr Wolf, and a fate to make among the stars.\nThe Lokatt MkII DSP Special Assault Frame \"Starr Wolf\"\n\"She's a world class rig, this beauty. Built of tri-cordal folded breon and pitch molded bitanium and armed to the hilt with all manner of noise makers and jail breakers. An imperial body with the smarts of an Exeter planet-pop and the guts of a top suit smuggler's tail. The Wolf's got a way with space, you see. She's hungry with her curves. She'll dance a fancy to dazzle but has the stuff to let fly when it gets to be a tussle. She's got a screaming howl and a ripping bite. Magna-casters bristle from her snout and she's carrying chain-dump slips to crackle the hull of anything smaller than a capital boat with a right fat uniformed commander in a big comfy chair. And she's all mine. I'm her captain.\" - Brick M. Stonewood\nBunny Bitshift\n\"One hundred thirty in the sleep is what we fly-boys used to call a raw deal. The full turnover. The reset button. Every Tom-Tom, Blaze Rider and Hooch-man you knew is dust and there you are with nothing but your grin and your chin. That's what it was for me on the Exeter, unfroze and lonely with the stink of kraz on my breath and a big dumb scowl. Nothing to lose but my guts and nowhere to go but sideways into the deep. That was what came of the Thearsal Knife, the whole-wide hero of THE GREAT WAR. Reduced to pan ash and staring at pin darts through the bottom of a bottle. And then I met Bunny.\" - Brick M. Stonewood  \nBunny Bitshift is not what she appears to be. Not to you, anyway. You see a girl with a wicked grin in a bunny suit. That's because you're a million years too early to this party. You've come with your eyes out of time. Just like Brick.\nRead more about Bunny here!\nThe aesthetics are key to the era of media Starr Mazer strives to evoke. In that time, art was forged despite limitations and beauty crafted in 16x16 pixelated tiles. From this we have embraced a style that is not just nostalgia, but a representation of a period of time in gaming. Our artists have managed to imbue the essence of that generation into the game. The art in Starr Mazer isn't something that could easily run on a 16-bit processor, but it looks like what you remember those games looking like the first time your cathode ray tube blasted the RF input out of the most advanced gaming technology of its time.\nThe original concepts and designs come from J\u00e9r\u00e9mie P\u00e9rin, a writer, animator, and director for TV animated series, video games, and short films. Well known among animators, pixel artists and retro fans for his amazing video \"Truckers Delight\", we're thrilled to have J\u00e9r\u00e9mie involved as a concept artist.\nThese designs are being realized into the game by Christina Antoinette Neophotistou, who is a rising star of the pixel art world. Having contributed to everything from full published games to weekend game jams with art, music, and design, Christina has proven herself as a pixel painting machine to be reckoned with.\nChiptune legend Alex Mauer is creating the score to Starr Mazer and we can think of none better for such an undertaking!  Here is a sample from our OST: \n\nAlex won't be working alone! We've assembled a dream team of influential artist from the indie, chiptune, and synthpop scenes.

Every hour spent clicking through puzzles and burning through credits were inspirations for a greater game. Each aspect of the characters, universe, and message of Starr Mazer have been solidified. The only thing the game needed was an opportunity. That time is now. Through Don\u2019s work in the game and film industries he\u2019s met a host of skilled individuals, always considering if they could be part of the team. He\u2019s now found the people to do it. They have the passion and understand what this game can be. We have the team that will make Starr Mazer the absolute best game it can be. Now we just need you to want it as much as we do. We want to be supported by the people who have always wanted this game, but never knew how to ask. We want to be supported by people who understand this vision and know that, if made uncompromised, this game will be better than any game we could have made on our own. Really, we just want to give you the absolute coolest game we can possibly conceive.\nThe majority of the team is currently building Starr Mazer as a part-time passion project. The amount we're asking for will enable the whole team to work full-time on Starr Mazer and bring Brick's story to life.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nDon has over 15 years of combined experience in programming, making award-winning films, and game development.

Collecting useful resources from the levels and taking them back to the house will let Grandma Margaret and Uncle Ben create useful items and gear that can then be used by family members as part of the persistent progression system in the game.\nWhile there exists a specific story arc in the game, you see various procedural narrative events and have the option to follow those events and experience your own unique story. This is the narrative-based roguelike part of Children of Morta. \nLevel generation is fully procedural in this game, you will never play the exact same level twice (well, for the math geeks out there, actually this might be possible, but the probability is extremely low!)\n Narrative-based Roguelike\nNarrative meets Roguelike in Children of Morta. You will experience permadeath and travel through new procedurally generated levels and content with each playthrough, but there exists a single story overarching the game. This story is filled with surprises, mysteries and emotions and will be narrated with the game events, quests, environments, and most importantly, by the interactions between the Bergsons. \nProcedural narrative events blend within the main game story and provide you with options to explore this rich world as you wish. Different players playing Children of Morta will have different experiences while following the same main story.\nFamily Culture\nThe Bergsons have their unique family culture. The elder members play an important role, especially grandma Margaret, who talks about the ancient stories and prophecies about the magical Mountain and their family heritage. Each of them has their own individual style and preferences, but their family bonds and their trust in each other are unheard of for those who do not live in the land of Morta.\nYou will learn about their culture as you play the game and become part of their adventures. Who knows, you will very well internalize this culture in your real life! Although beware that some of their rituals are not to be tried at home!\nMount Morta\nTo the villagers and people living on the outskirts of Mount Morta, the mountain is everything. Full of history, legends and magic; a symbol and source of life, health and prosperity. \n\nMount Morta\u2019s diverse environments host many creatures and forms of life: the Caeldippo caves to the west, where the goblins live, Postigala forest in the east and the Masks Temple right in the center of the mountain, all filled with mysteries and wonders waiting to be explored.\nBut its once beautiful and high peaks are now turned into dark and hostile areas filled with corrupted creatures. \nCaeldippo Caves\nMasks Temple\nPostigala Forest\n Mountain Gods and Divine Relics\nClawious - Hellworm\nSkelsol - Blood Bat\nBoomer Goblin - Spika\n More enemy sketches:\nBoss Fights\nThe bosses are gatekeepers in Mount Morta which have been corrupted. They will block your way and trying to pass them will lead you into an epic Boss Fight!\nYou will encounter many bosses in the lands of Morta, meet two of them here:\nJariuth the Goblin King\nScorpital\nMusic\nhttp://deadmage.com\nThe Children of Morta team is:\nReza Hooshangi @Reza_Hooshangi\nSoheil Zarghami @SolZarghami\nArvin Garousi @ArvivrA\n Hamidreza Ansari @LoudWings\nShervin R.

Working on new areas usually has this risk due to unknown factors that might show up during the development. In order to mitigate this risk, we have already finished a long pre-production phase where we tried to develop a vertical slice of the game so that we minimize the unknown factors in development. We know very well that risk factors never turn to zero and we are certain to communicate with the community openly about any possible issues that might delay our development plans.\n\nAnother risk for Children of Morta is the novelty risk. The game is novel in blending story telling within a roguelike genre. We are looking forward to let the player experience a specific story arc while seeing random narrative events and procedural content for the gameplay and levels. We have worked on numerous prototypes already and so far we believe that we have been able to tackle this risk very well. We still need external feedback to make sure everything is in place.\n\nFinancial risk threatens small teams, in our case we have already spent our own money on this project and will make sure we release this game that we have all been dreaming of for quite some time. The community support will help us add all the great features to this game and spend enough time to polish every aspect of it and deliver the final game with the level of quality we are aiming.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #56", "update_userinfo": "Shipping Address for Physical Reward", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #55", "update_userinfo": "Children of Morta - Paws and Claws Charity DLC is OUT NOW!", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #54", "update_userinfo": "A very special update: a new character - designed by one of our Backers - is here!", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #53", "update_userinfo": "Setting Sun Inn - NEW GAME+ Added | Free Content Update", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #52", "update_userinfo": "Children of Morta - Shrine of Challenge | Free Content Update", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #51", "update_userinfo": "Art book and original soundtracks are HERE!", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #50", "update_userinfo": "Development Roadmap is here!", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #49", "update_userinfo": "Children of Morta | Update about Switch codes for Backers!", "update_content": ""}, {"status": []}], "comment_no": 806, "projec_url": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/deadmage/children-of-morta", "project_name": "Children of Morta"}}, {"backer": "JoeK Minis", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Corvus Corax Miniatures is a small hobby project that is being developed and managed by a single person; a hobbyist like yourself who now has taken a greater interest in the developing aspect of this hobby alongside of playing, painting and collecting miniatures. It is a project that needs Your support in order for it to succeed. This project relies on outside partners (illustrators and concept artists, sculptors and casters) and it's towards the continuation of development all funds will be allocated. Without a successful funding the project will still proceed, just at a much slower pace.\nCorvus Corax Miniatures is the working name for a project to develop a skirmish miniature boardgame, set in a dark fantasy world, where each side will be able to field around 5-6 miniatures for each skirmish confrontation. The scale of the miniatures is 35 mm and they are produced in high quality, non-toxic resin.\nAbout the ultimate goal...\nThe ultimate goal is to develop a tabletop game with a focus on low-count skirmish confrontations, where each side will be able to field, as a standard, 5 characters. The aim is to create a fast-paced and easy-to-play game that focuses on strategy and team synergy, and where the players will be able to customize their characters after their preferred gaming style (within some limitations, of course). The game mechanics and rules are still a work in-progress, and will, hopefully, be realized during 2015 as a free-to-download .pdf document.\nHowever, for this project, the goal is to raise enough funds to speed up the release of some the miniatures for this world/game and, if possible, to help the continuation of the development of the miniatures.\nThe miniatures\nLarger pictures can be seen here:\nKruuz\nhttp://4.bp.blogspot.com/-clL6YrwOPBo/VGzxH7SqSEI/AAAAAAAAAEQ/nLXe1z67SmE/s1600/mutated%2Bwith%2Bclaw.jpg\n\nOren\nhttp://4.bp.blogspot.com/-XimdTmtQifk/VG-sc5Lek1I/AAAAAAAAAE0/z1T1cex5aHo/s1600/mutated%2Bbrute%2Bpainted.jpg\n\nFaun\nhttp://1.bp.blogspot.com/-P0m72xKNiTU/VHeUdKSTCqI/AAAAAAAAAFk/8XUUEtZRXeI/s1600/mutated%2Bdevil%2Bpainted.jpg\n\nAbout the world...\nThe world is set in a dark and low-fantasy setting and the focus will be around men and beasts, where dwarves, orcs, goblins and elves do not exist. The story is mainly focused on men vs men, albeit some are more degenerated than others.\nThere are currently four different factions being worked on and these will be the main focus of the gaming aspect early on. Once they are fleshed out there will be another few in the pipeline. The setting take its inspiration from our current history in some parts, but with a fantasy take on them.\nThe factions\nThere are currently four factions being developed, although each one is still in a very early stage as the project is only in its bud; some are more developed than others, though.\n\"We are venom of this world, like poison running through your veins, you will suffer like we have suffered!\"\nThe Outcasts are feral men that have been shunned by their former society generations ago, and have now adapted to a tribal life where they live by the principles of might is right and the survival of the strongest. These men are divided into countless of tribes scattered far and wide, but can be found mostly in the most hostile of environments; barren lands, deep forests or around the vast mountains. They have turned primal and predatory and live day-by-day with no real thought  of tomorrow, focused only on survival. Each tribe is built around the alpha - the strongest of the men - and many asepcts of the hierarchy resembles that of a wolf pack. Each member of the tribe has to be able to carry his or her own weight, or be quickly preyed upon. The Outcasts, in general, are raiders, preying on settlements and other neighbouring tribes. Only occassionally the tribal warring cease for a moment and they gather under a particular strong alpha and lay siege to larger towns and even cities.\n \"Our will is strong, like iron, it will never break!\"\nThe Exiles of the Tetsu Clan were once a part of the Greater Raising Empire, where the leader of the clan even held seat as a trusted advisor to the Shogun himself. The Shogun was a man of tradition, and failed to see how the rest of the world was changing, despite being advised to adapt. This led to a great schism within the council that resulted in an uprising led by the Tetsu Clan, although most of the military power still remained loyal to the Shogun. The uprising was met with force and duly crushed, with no mercy being shown. The members of the Tetsu Clan, and its followers, were deemed as exiles and anyone giving them shelter or help would be seen as traitors and executed without trial. So they fled in order to rebuild and to, one day, return.\n\"Like a storm gale we will sweep across the world!\"\nThe Nomads is a common name for the travelling people of the North. Some see them as barbarians and evil people, when in truth they are no more evil than anyone else. It is true that the Nomads expand their borders, usually along the coast-lines, using force as they do so. But the world is not a peaceful place, and these loyal people aim to secure the land for their families to settle. The Nomads of the Birch House is one of the more venturous of Houses and seeks to gain a foothold further away from their homeland than most others. As they spearhead the Nomads exploration they are among the most battle-tested veterans of their kin.\n\"No allegiance do we hold, no oath do we swear! Loyalty only to the city!\"\nThe city-state of Rexen was once the crowning jewel of a much wider realm that was ruled by a King, stretching almost from coast-to-coast. However, Rexen was heavily taxed, setting its population on the path to revolution. It was then that the council formed, electing a new leader that declared the city of Rexen independent. Of course, the King and the realm could not accept this and laid siege to the city. For years the siege lasted, but the walls remained true to its citizens and their will was unshaken. On the twelfth day of the first month of the fourth year of the siege, the defenders sallied forth, and the attackers, starved and nigh on frozen to death, were trampled down. Since then, the Free City of Rexen has continued to prosper and grow large in both arms and wealth.\nKruuz, the Copperheaded One of the Dur Makeb tribe\nKruuz is the current alpha of the Dur Makeb tribe, a position he violently secured at a young age. For violence is what breeds the tribesmen, and even almost from birth they have to rely on themselves for survival as only the strong prosper while the weak perish. One could tell that Kruuz, even from birth, would become exceptionally ruthless; he saw the first light of day as he ripped up the womb of his own mother at birth. Since Kruuz became the alpha, none has yet dared to challenge his authority. But life is fragile and life is short, and if the other tribesmen are not subjugated, surely it is just a matter of time before Kruuz is ended by someone mightier than himself; that is simply how life is for an outcast.\nSculpted by Roberto Chaudon.\nOren, Behemoth of the Dur Makeb tribe\nOren is a grotesque and mindless beast, only capable of the simplest form of communication. But what he lacks in intelligence he makes up for in brute strength. For strength and savagery is where Oren excels above all others. But this combination comes at great risk, for Oren is known to turn against his tribesmen without any warning of his intentions. Without the purpose of war and destruction Oren is overcome by restlessness and he is easy to anger but hard to please. This has led to that he has been shackled in heavy chains, like that of an animal, and only let lose when it's time to march for battle.\nSculpted by Luc \"Thantor\" Pinganaud.\n Faun, Void-walker of the Dur Makeb tribe\nMany of the outcasts are gifted, as well as being cursed, by their mutations, and some of these mutations greatly enhance the prowess by the host of these. In Faun's case it was evident early that he possessed in particularly rare abilities. Faun was born in the darkness, and was born sightless, so he had to adapt to a life in shadows. As he grew older his mutation not only affected his body, as it started to transform him more and more to the looks of a half-devil, but it also affected his mind and he soon became one with the void; not only did the void grant him the ability to see through shadows but also to walk through them from one spot to another. Faun is a highly regarded member of the Dur Makeb tribe where his ability to quickly move across the field of battle, and the ability to see his enemies even in blind spots, has won the tribe many battles.\nSculpted by Roberto Chaudon.\n Casts of the resin miniatures:\nCurrency conversion\n1 SEK (Swedish Krona) = aprox. 0,11 Euros\n1 SEK (Swedish Krona) = aprox. 0,12 USD\n1 SEK (Swedish Krona) = aprox. 0,08 GBP\nStretch Goals\nStretch Goal - 15,000 SEK - LOCKED\nStretch Goal - 22,500 SEK - LOCKED\n  Stretch Goal - 30,000 SEK - Something slimy?? - LOCKED\nFurther Stretch Goals?\nThis project will initially focus on the Outcast faction. Miniatures for the other factions, for example the Exiles or the Nomads, could be added as stretch goals if we attract enough backers.\nAdd-ons\nIf you are interested in adding more miniatures to your pledge, you may easily do so by adding an extra 120 SEK to your pledge for each additional miniature that you wish to add. Please be aware that with the more miniatures added to the pledge, the higher the shipping can potentially become.\nShipping\nShipping can either be paid for during the Kickstarter project or it can be paid for separately through PayPal, bank transfer or money order of your choosing after the project has ended. To pay for it during the Kickstarter, simply add the corresponding amount listed below to your Pledge (by using the button \"Manage\").\nFor Europe: 1-3 miniatures - 38 SEK\nFor RoW: 1-3 miniatures - 40 SEK\nThis will cover the shipping cost, a padded envelope, bubble wrap for the miniature, and a kraft box for extra protection.\nIf you are interested in more than 3 miniatures, please send me a message asking for the correct price (it will be different depending on how many miniatures you want), or pay for it after the project ends through Paypal, money order or bank transfer.\nIf you want to pay additional for tracking (recommended letter) that will be an extra 85 SEK.\nShipping waves\nShipping will be done through \"waves\" as resin casts of the miniatures are produced and sent back to me. However, a small number of miniatures have already been cast and are ready to be shipped out. Thusly, the \"shipping waves\" will only come into effect in case the project exceeds all expectations. But, being a realistic, I don't expect that to occur, so shipping should by all calculations be taken care of swiftly.\nAlthough, in the event of a much wider audience than expected, further casting will only be done after the project has ended.\nWhy crowdfunding?\nIt is true that most of the work has already been done and there are miniatures to show for that, both copies of the resin cast and painted versions. But as only the ideas come from me and everything else is going through outside partners (design, sculpting, casting) this is a rather expensive process, which is why I need Your help through this part of the project and with Your help be able to release some new miniatures to the market. With a successful kickstarter campaign, I will be able to speed up the casting process and get a jump on being closer to complete at least five characters for each faction to allow for some variety once the game is ready.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAnyone who has backed a Kickstarter before is well aware of some of the biggest risks with backing a project. I, myself, have backed over 30 different projects, and through that, I've got an insight on some of the difficulties with running a successful project. These risks are well considered and steps have been taken to attempt to minimize them:\n\n1.) Delays\n2.) Quality\n3.) Communication\n\nDelays\nLet's be frank here; delays appear to be norm rather than the exception. The reason for this one can only speculate in, which I will not do. I will instead give you my take on delays for this specific project.\n\nThis project is focused around raising funds for creation of miniatures, and because of this, there will be some risks involved with it. The risk comes from partners not being able to deliver on target. There are concept artists and illustrators, there are sculptors, there are casters, and then there are the different shipping companies. If one link in the chain breaks, it will obviously affect the rest.\n\nHowever, these types of delays should not be a problem. The miniatures are sculpted and they have been cast in a number of copies already. The turn-around of this project should because of that be quite short for the first backers; and then shipping will go out in waves. Because of this I am confident that I will be able to meet the projected estimated delivery date for all backers!\n\nQuality\nThere are always some concerns regarding the quality of material used for casting. For this project, I have worked together with a skilled caster with extended knowledge of the casting process. The resin is of high quality, holds detail great and is sturdy (for being resin). However, like always when it concerns resin there will always be the risk of it breaking in transit. I will do my best to ensure the miniature is well-protected when sending it to you to reduce this risk.\n\nCommunication\nI am dedicated to this project and will do my best to be reachable to answer any questions; both during and after the project ends. Of course, there will always be the risk that something unforeseen occurs on a personal level but as long as everything proceeds as expected, you can trust in easy and fast access to me with any and all your inquiries.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #13", "update_userinfo": "Kickstarter #6 now LIVE!", "update_content": "Final 48 hours!

You can see here the different locations the Black Sailors want to explore and conquer. It's your turn to help them find Old Jack's chest! They will need new crew members and equipment to fulfill this journey, will you join the Black Sailors?\n\nGuruk, the first mate, is the first born for the Black Sailors. Created from putty and madness by Allan Carasco, he is the first member of the whole crew. \nGuruk is not clever. He's not intelligent. He's not smart... how many times do we need to say this? But he can smash skulls with one hand and whip the crew in line with one blink! No surprise that he was the first sailor to be chosen by the Kaptain to join the crew. A true Orc where it counts. He can kill you without a second thought, and probably kill you again because he forgot he did it the first time...\"  \nKaptain Gorak the Red is the second miniature born from the gifted hands of Allan Carasco. \n\"What happens when you have an Orc with a brain? Well brain plus orc equals leadership, and leadership equals the Kaptain! Gorak was the first to solve this daunting equation... or maybe it was because he had the biggest gun at the moment and was the only one left standing. Nevertheless, as the new Kaptain Gorak has a plan! Long ago he heard the legend of Old Jack's chest, a famous hidden treasure hidden somewhere along the Storm Coast. Hidden at the bottom of the sea, it lies guarded by monsters and sirens. However, there is nothing that will stand in the way of the Kaptain's quest! Maybe raiding all the villages along the shore is not necessary, but there is nothing wrong with a little fun along the way, is there? Besides, the ship needs wood and powder, and the boys need blood and mayhem...\" \n    New member of \"The Crew\", Papa Jambo, witch doctor. Sculpted by Joaquin \"Freeman\" Palacios, \n \"Papa Jambo wasn't always a witch doctor. He began as the real doctor of the crew and then things turned ugly. At first, it was really simple for him. It bleeds you burn. It's opened you sew it back inside. It's broken...you unbroke it with planks and nails. Then things started to be a little bit more complicated. Crew members started to get sick. No blood, no broken bones, only sick. So Jambo tried the famous blood magic, seemed easy at first glance. But the crew members got sicker and sicker and then some of them died because of his magic. So the Kaptain had an idea, using his magic against the other ships, and to Jambo's greatest relief it worked amazingly. Now he does his voodoo mumbo jumbo on the other ships and enemies start dying without using gun powder, making Gorak really happy. The hat comes with the function of course...\"\nSharki, the diver joins the crew, sculpted again by Joaquin \"Freeman\" Palacios\n\n\"Nobody remembers Sharki's real name, probably something with a lot of K and R, something terrible as any Orc name. But he doesn't want to be called by his birth name anymore, only Sharki cause he deserved it and no one will argue with that. He is probably the most violent crew member, only second to Guruk, and he has a short temper. So short that one day he ended on the plank with the Kaptain himself pushing him in the back. You don't mess with the Kaptain. Sharki entered the water, and was immediately surrounded by real carcarodons, logical ashore Shark island...But after 20 minutes of blood bath, he emerged out of the waters, a tail between his teeth. After that high deed, the Kaptain immediately promoted him, and now Sharki leads the underwater sabotage group who sunk the ships in harbors before attacks.\"\nUgg the troll cook is the third miniature of the brand. Sculpted again by the talented Allan Carrasco, \n\"Chop chop chop... is that the only words that dumb oaf can pronounce? Ugg is not well known for his wits or the size of his vocabulary, but boy does he ever know how to use that cleaver! Whether is chopping lunch or chopping heads the cook gets the job done. Just be sure to use simple words so he doesn't get the too confused. A liability in some ways but a rare combination of talents which the Kaptain accepts. As for the food, he claims his stew is the best of all the Storm Coast... that is if you don't mind your dinner coming up right after it goes down\n This time sculpted by master Pedro Fernandez, Gungh Jin joins the members of \"The Kitchen\".  \n\"In the past, the ship used to have goblins and snotlings to clean the deck. But that was before Gungh Jin. The troll seemed to love goblins and snotlings...as snacks, or cleaning mops. When the boys discovered him on the secluded Night Island, he was polishing the bones and helmets of the poor previous expedition crew. The armors were so clean that they almost shined in the night. Ok it took time to convince the troll to board the ship, time and a lot of beating and threatening but in the end he agreed to join the crew as the new cleaning manager. Sometimes one snotling disappears or one goblin runs franticly, screaming and cursing, but look how the ship is clean ! And it's a good thing because blood is really sticking after the raids.\"\nKing Khung the little monkey\n\nKing Khung the little monkey is the mascot of the ship, born directly from Big Childs, sculpted by Ivan Santurio de la Uz. \n\"Pirating can be a lonely business, and every Kaptain needs a trusty little companion. King Khung is the little monkey who fills this role for Gorak, and he has become the mascot of his Great pirate galleon: the Skulls Crusher. Found on the mysterious Monkey Island ( brilliantly named by the drunken dwarf who discovered it)  Khung seemed like he would be an amusing addition to the crew. But one day, to the shock and delight of the crew, Khung stole a saber in the heat of the battle and plunged it in the heart of a filthy elf! From that day on, the devilish monkey fought like any other member of the crew. When the sound of battle calls this monkey goes bananas!\"  \nFirst miniature sculpted by Christian Hardy for Big Child, Swift starts running now !\n\"Swift steals. Steals and runs. Steals, runs and sometimes falls down. One day he fell down on the wrong shoe. Gorak's boot actually. The Kaptain bent over the little creature and, God knows why, lifted it up and spared his life. Maybe Gorak found sometimes interesting in Swift. Maybe it's his quickness or his discretion, but anyway Swift survived the encounter. Now he is the first scout for any boarding party, and he is in charge of marking the weak spots on enemy ships. But he is definitely not responsible of the treasure chest...\"\n\"Jhexx earned his nickname after a few...adventures, so to speak. As a young hobgoblin, he had a thing for fire. For fire and powder. He liked to make things explode. The funny thing is that sometimes it was useful. Like that one time, he put the whole human garnison on fire in the Black Harbor. But sometimes he wasn't helping. Making the hut of Papa Jambo vanish into thin air was not the best idea. But Jhexx had a lucky star looking upon him. Under the hut of the Witch Doctor was the entrance of a cave, hiding a big chest, full of coins. Therefore Papa Jabo speared the life of the hobgoblin, only to buy him a small canon, called Little Bomba. Jhexx considers it his best friend...the other crewmates look worried at them now...\"\n\n\nPLEDGE LEVELS \n\n** Note : all prices are in Canadian Dollars\n** Note : do not include the shipping rates inside you pledge amount for the moment.

Wonder no more!\nTwenty-five years ago, Ron Gilbert and Gary Winnick created the game that introduced the world to 2D point & click adventure games. Maniac Mansion took the computer game world by storm with its compelling story, complex puzzles, cutting edge humor, engaging game play, and provided an entire generation with a new idea of what an adventure game could be. Blah blah blah...\nAnd now they are back together with an all new 2D point & click adventure game!  Ron is skinny again and Gary had that rash looked at \u2014 and they're here (finally!) to create the true spiritual successor to Maniac Mansion and Monkey Island.\nThimbleweed Park is a new game that cuts to the core of what made classic point & click adventure games so special, and done by the actual people who spawned the genre.\nIt's deep, it's challenging, it's funny, it's everything you loved about adventure games.\nHoly crap is this going to be fun! And you can be part of it - right here and right now for $20 bucks which is like $1.52 in 1987 dollars.\nWhy do we want to make Thimbleweed Park? Because we miss classic adventures and all their innocence and charm. \nThey were fun and would put a smile on your face. We want to make one of those again and we want to do it right. We don\u2019t want to make a game \u201cinspired by,\u201d or \u201cpaying homage to\u201d classic point & click adventures, we want to make a real classic point & click adventure. \nThimbleweed Park is a game for true lovers of adventure games. This is a Kickstarter for fans who loved Maniac Mansion, Monkey Island, and everything else that made that era great.  It strips away all the cruft built up over the years and is distilled down to what we loved about the genre.\n                                By popular demand and with thanks to the fine folks at Humble Bundle, we are now offering the ability to pay using PayPal. If you can back through Kickstarter directly, we kindly ask you to do that. It will make our lives a bit easier. But if you can't, then we're here for you. We got your back. \nAnyone who backs at $50 or higher will not only get their name in the Thimbleweed Park phone book (used for actual puzzle solving), but you\u2019ll also be able to record your own custom voicemail message when the number is called (subject to approval).\n               Please back our stretch goals and help us make Thimbleweed Park the best damn point & click adventure game you've played since that last point & click adventure game you played and liked.\nThimbleweed Park is the curious story of two washed up detectives called in to investigate a dead body found in the river just outside of town. It\u2019s a game where you switch between five playable characters while uncovering the dark, satirical and bizarre world of Thimbleweed Park.\nLost along a dusty stretch of highway, the town of Thimbleweed Park once boasted an opulent hotel, a vibrant business district and the state\u2019s largest pillow factory, but now teeters on the edge of oblivion and continues to exist for no real reason. It\u2019s a town that makes you itch and your skin crawl. It\u2019s a place no one ever looks for, but everyone seems to find. \nNot far from town, Delores and her siblings are gathered at the reading of her rich uncle\u2019s will where the backstabbing, intrigue and puzzle solving knows no end. How is this all connected to the dead body under the bridge? Good question.\nAt the long abandoned circus grounds, Ransome the Clown had been cursed and can never remove his make-up. How did he get into this situation? How can he get out? Does he really want to? What\u2019s up with that dead body slowly bloating in the water? Who knows!\nMeanwhile, on the 13th floor of the Edmund hotel, Franklin wakes up with no idea how he got there. But that\u2019s not the weird part. The weird part is that he\u2019s dead. Spoiler: He\u2019s not the body found just outside of Thimbleweed Park. Wow! That's confusing. Don\u2019t panic, we\u2019re just as confused as you are.\nWe like big pixels. Huge ones. Pixels that have their own Zip Codes. Pixels a family of six could live inside of and still have room for Uncle Pete when he drops in unexpectedly on his way to the coast.\nWe had a lot of fun building Maniac Mansion, there was a charm and simplicity to the art that let the game design shine and your imagination run wild.\nWe want Thimbleweed Park to be like an undiscovered classic LucasArts' adventure game you'd never played before. A game discovered in a dusty old desk that puts a smile on your face and sends a wave of nostalgia through you in the same way it does for us.\nRon Gilbert and Gary Winnick created and designed Maniac Mansion and have extensive experience making games over the past 25 years. Maniac Mansion was LucasArts\u2019 first adventure game and the point & click adventure game that spawned the genre we know and love today.\nRON GILBERT is a game designer, writer and programmer best known for creating and designing the cult classic adventure games Maniac Mansion and Monkey Island. Ron was the ninth employee at Lucasfilm Games, instrumental in their leap into adventure games, and creator of the SCUMM engine. He was the co-founder of Humongous Entertainment and made numerous adventure games for kids, such as Putt-Putt, Freddi Fish and Pajama Sam. His most recent work includes the adventure/RPG DeathSpank, The Cave and indie mobile games The Big Big Castle and Scurvy Scallywags.\nGARY WINNICK is an artist, writer, designer and art director. During his ten year stint at Lucasfilm Games he co-designed and created all the art for their first graphic adventure Maniac Mansion. Additionally, he created art for and art directed many other LucasArts games including Zak McKracken, Loom, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, Monkey Island and Habitat. Gary created the original property Defenders of Dynatron City, co-plotted a six issue mini-series for Marvel and served as a producer for the animated TV special. He was a co-founder of Lightsource Studios and Suddenly Social. His most recent graphic novel Bad Dreams is currently being published by comic company Red 5.\nJust like they were on Maniac Mansion, Ron and Gary will be the core of the team building this new point & click adventure, co-designing and writing with Ron doing the bulk of the programming and Gary doing the art.  Good times.\nAn additional programmer and artist will be added 6 months into production, along with a part-time musician. Dedicated testers will join as the game nears completion.\nWe're fully devoting ourselves to Thimbleweed Park in the same way we did Maniac Mansion, Monkey Island and everything else we do. This is a serious full-time project for us. We want to make the best classic point & click adventure we can.\nFollow and participate in the game's development on our website, where Ron, Gary and other members of the team will discuss behind-the-scenes art, designs, information, cooking, gossip, answer questions, get feedback and generally have a lot of fun*. \n* Fun not guaranteed and void where prohibited by law.\nTons of other fascinating rewards can be found by looking to your right\u2026 over there\u2026 no, a little higher\u2026 scroll up\u2026 there!\n** Rewards icons are for reference, entertainment and gambling purposes only and are not necessarily representative of the final rewards.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nBuilding games is always risky.

The players take control of a faction that can be shaped by choosing troops, characters and cards that best adapt to their game style.\nFallen Frontiers is a miniatures wargame game based on combat squads. The squads offer protection and firepower for the force's heroes. Heroes are the ones that define the game style because their attributes change the characteristics of their squads. Because of this each squad performs differently depending on the hero that leads them. However in Fallen Frontiers heroes are not invincible, but instead are easy to eliminate when they are not with their squad.\nBesides the miniatures that represent their army, players will also have a deck of cards assembled by them. Since this deck of cards is prepared secretly, players don't know their opponent's strategy, allowing them to change their play style in such a way that opponents will not be able to guess their strategy at first sight.\nThe factions and the cards use up resources to carry out certain actions. The main resources are Command and Krithium. Players gain Command by holding objectives and maintaining a strong leadership in their army. Using Command points will make an army more powerful and allow players to use their cards. Krithium is a resource that must be collected during the game. It is the source of energy that enhances an army's equipment and cards. The player will have an armory, a separate deck where he purchases equipment, that can be used during the game and consumes Krithium. The contents of the armory is also set up by the player just like the deck of cards.\nThe basic box contains 2 factions to your choice ready to fight. A total of 33 miniatures or more is included, but should the Kickstarter perform well it will end up being much more. It has all you need to start playing: an initial deck of cards, rules, scoreboards, common tables and even colored scenery elements to create the right environment on your game table.\nThe miniatures are of an extraordinary quality and have been designed by both painters and players in order to offer the maximum realism on the table as well as making them easier to paint. The Kickstarter will contain two more factions (Sayx and Harvesters) than those included in the basic box, and improvements on all four that consist of heavy infantry and vehicles.\nThe scale of our miniatures is 35mm to the eyes and are therefore compatible with other miniatures and scenery on the market. This means that a 1,80m tall human in a standing pose is 38mm tall from head to sole, which is also known as 1:48 scale (American O scale). However, being either alien or super humans, some faction models in Fallen Frontiers game are slightly larger than regular humans.\nComparison of scale.\nEveryone who buys the game box will get an exclusive BACKER LIMITED EDITION that will have a different cover from the commercial version. Inside you will also find four different faction postcards in A5 format, a numbered backer certificate and two exclusive models that will not be sold in stores or online.\nFallen Frontiers scenery comes printed and ready to assemble and play. All scenery elements are printed on both sides in high density cardboard and most of them are reversible doubling your scenery options.\nClick on Pledges to see content\nClick on Pledges to see content\n    Boosters are elite miniature packs intended to give your army more versatility. For example, adding one or two units of Berserkers will transform your Riff combat force into a deadly close combat army. On the other hand, if you like a shooting army, Hulks will fit perfectly into your riff force capable of soaking a lot of fire while spitting a rain of bullets onto the enemy.\nYou can get two boosters by choosing the Battle Squad or Elite Squad pledges, and you can get any number as an add on.\nNOTE: The poses of the final figures may vary.\n NOTE: The poses of the final figures may vary.\n NOTE: The poses of the final figures may vary.\nIt is a firm decision that the only material we will be using for the production of Fallen Frontiers is Polyurethane Resin.\nHere are our reasons for choosing this material:\nWe can produce the miniatures in our factory in Spain, which allows us to have more control over the quality and the production process in a direct manner. We will not have to rely on a third party for production of our miniatures, and we can deliver a finished product with high quality details. It is easy to handle, has high durability, and a light weight for both playing and painting.\nWe want to keep the production cost under control, so we don\u2019t need to invest in expensive tooling for plastic casting, allowing us to significantly reduce our funding goal. This means that anything over the funding goal will unlock more stretch goals that give our backers more options for physical rewards.\nScale Games has always strived to produce the very best product in both detail and material, and we feel that the use of polyurethane resin for this project will provide the players and the painters with the best material for the greatest detail and durability.\nInterested in seeing other people's opinion of our miniatures?

The purpose of this Kickstarter is to bring the world of Morn to life and enable us to invest more funds into the designing and manufacturing of our core factions for our Underdeep game.  We plan to release the first faction; Goblin-kind in Spring/Summer 2015, after we have fulfilled this Kickstarter.\nThe Monsters of Underdeep Kickstarter allows you to pledge toward the manufacture of our range massive 28mm scale, high quality resin miniatures.  These figures are not for the faint-hearted with the average model standing at around 55mm to its eyeline.\n This Kickstarter will begin with two of our standout creations; the Bugbear Ironshield and the Flesh Golem.  The Bugbear will be part of the Goblin-kind faction, whilst the Flesh Golem is part of the Abominations faction.\nThe Bugbear Ironshield\nA metal-clad behemoth used to protect the tunnels of the Underdeep from intruders.  They are most often found in the service of Hobgoblins who arm and equip these creatures, but their services are also used by Goblins who pay well for their singular talents.  Things run smoothly when employing Bugbears, until the food runs out... then the problems start!\nThe Bugbear Ironshield is cast in high quality resin.  He will form a basic BRUTE choice or can be purchased separately from the addon store for \u00a318.\n The bugbear comes in the following pieces.  Only the shield, head and weapon arm will changes as these parts become available.\nThe initial Bugbear Ironshield Parts\nPLAY\n\n The Flesh Golem\nThe Flesh Golem is just a term used by the few that have seen such a creature and lived.  The Paladin hero Gordric of Guil described one such encounter in his memoirs whilst battling the ancient Liche Priest Savos.\n ... the ground shook with its steps.  Twice as tall as myself and immeasurably greater in bulk, it smashed aside the barricade we had thrown together and set upon destroying our forces.  It was hard to tell its true shape... vaguely that of a man or a giant perhaps.  Its parts were stitched and held together by wire, rivets, bolts and bone.  One arm was that of giant bear or lion.  It was covered in matted hair and blood, its claws like razors.  It's other arms were finer, more humanoid and more numerous.  I counted four in total, each wielding a cruel hacking blade that made short work of my men.  I tried to engage the creature, to summon the will to fight... but my courage left me as I stared into the only eye visable to me through the remnants of an iron mask.  I am sure to this day the mask was made with one thing in mind... to spare us all from the visage within....\n               Sir Gordric of Guil, Battle of Darkendelve 75 years before the Reckoning\nThe Flesh Golem is a basic BRUTE choice in the Kickstarter or can be purchased from the Addon Store for \u00a318!\n The Loyalty Head - The Myrmidon Helm\nThis added extra is FREE to all of those people who supported the first campaign.  If you would like to purchase the Myrmidon Helm it is available to purchase separately from the addon store for the price of \u00a33.\n You want to pledge right?  A little confused?  I hope not.  But I will try to explain everything in detail.  The pledges are all very similar.  They will give you a number of BRUTE choices to make when the KS is over, essentially picking the monsters you want from those available and the parts you would like to have with each choice.\nPremium Pledges\nAll of the pledges above and including the Mega Bundle are considered Premium Pledges.  Pledgers who pledge for these options will gain access to the free stretch goals.  NOT ALL STRETCH GOALS ARE FREE!  When a stetchgoal is unlocked it will clearly show what parts are free.  The parts marked as free will be included in your final parcel free of charge and will be in addition to any other parts that form your pledge.\nHere are some examples...\nA Standard Pledge\nGet our Underdeep Avatar from here:\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/h6nsciuc8v8rm45/Underdeep%20Avatar.jpg?dl=0\n With this KS the idea is that our stretchgoals will come thick and fast with, sometimes, as little as \u00a3750 between them!\nEach stretchgoal will reveal either a new set of additional parts for an existing monster, or a brand new monsters to add to the pool available.  Remember, as soon as a new part becomes available, you can pick it as part of your basic monster pledge.  \nExample: You have pledged for the BRUTE Pledge \u00a318.  For this you get the basic Bugber parts shown above.  But if Head B is now available you can choose head B instead of Head A.  Get it?  \nThe first stretchgoal is shown below.

As you can see we have many different stretchgoals to offer you including new an exciting monsters. \n Welcome to the Addon Store!\nThis area of the Kickstarter page enables you to add to your basic pledge.  You can add additional figures, parts and even pledges if you wish!  Keep an eye out for updates that add stretchgoals to the addon store.  \nIn order to add to your order, simply just add the value of additional parts or miniatures you would like to purchase to your original pledge.  The current ADDON STORE graphic is below.  This will be updated as more gets added.\n Underdeep is a miniature war-game where players take control of powerful Overlords and their retinues of followers from deep within the Underdeep and its environs. In Underdeep only the cunning or the strongest survive. You will need both to ensure your future in the Underdeep is secure\u2026 at least for now.  We will be releasing the Underdeep game in 2015 so you can use your miniatures in their intended setting!\nMorn is a desolate world. Many centuries ago a cataclysmic war raged across the world. Man, Elf and Dwarf formed vast armies to combat the scourge from below, the armies of the Underdeep. The Underdeep had long been a source of conflict for the races know as the Sunsiders. Many rare and precious metals, stone and jewels lay beneath their feet and it was during these ventures that the two worlds collided. One world of light... the other of Darkness. \n Eventually a dark entity united the squabbling races of the Underdeep and a vast host poured forth to take vengeance on the Sunsiders. The war lasted for fifty years. Nations were vanquished, Kings slaughtered and races brought to the very brink of extinction. However, the forces of light prevailed and the creatures of the Underdeep were forced back down into the depths. Now, hundreds of years later Sunside has still not recovered. The Elves have withdrawn to their citadels, the Dwarves have fortified their mine cities and the few human kingdoms that remain hide behind their enormous walls. The once proud kingdoms are now wilderness punctuated with small towns and villages with no one to rely on for protection but themselves. And once again evil stirs in the deep... The world of Morn awakens to a new day. \nThe sun slowly rises over the mountains and spills its golden glow on a land recovering from eons of war. Farmers till the land, shepherds tend the flocks and the good folk of the world grapple with the toils the day will bring. Deep below the surface world there is no dawn... only darkness. The Sunsiders think their lives are hard but food is plentiful, resources abundant and the dawn brings new hope. The Underdeep has no such hope...only the strong survive and the strong must fight for everything. The darkness holds many races, some pushed into the caves and dark places of the world by the Sunsiders, other races have always dwelt in the shadows. They vie for supremacy, King versus King, tribe versus tribe, clan versus clan. The only thing that unites these creatures is their lust for conquest, their need for revenge on the surface world. That day will come, but for now they must battle for control of the UNDERDEEP.\n Postage is always a contencious issue when it comes to running a KS.  We are lucky in that we have a major UK distributor with channels across Europe and North America to help us.  However, we have not been able to offer free postage to everyone.  Most of the resin figures we manufacture are light so we are happy to offer the discounted postage rates to the US/EU and to the ROW as shown on the pledge levels.\nWhen you pledge and you are overseas you will be charged the basic level of shipping for that item.  This overseas charge is for Europe and the US only.  All other areas will need to add the extra funds as highlighted by the individual pledge you have picked.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs with most projects there are some risks and challenges that can beset a project like ours. The two main areas of importance for me are the following: \n\n* QUALITY OF SERVICE \n\n* QUALITY OF PRODUCT \n\nAs a buyer of miniatures, boardgames, rpgs and other table top games over the last 25 years I understand what makes a quality product. The main reason we decided to work with Zealot Miniatures for the casting was down to quality. I was given cheaper options but I wasn't happy with the production quality of the finished article I had seen elsewhere. \n\nWe would hope to have the majority of the models out to customers by April 2015 at the latest but speaking with Zealot (and taking into account the conclusion of their own Kickstarter) we have opted for May 2015. Both myself and Zealot feel we can make this deadline. We plan to do a weekly/fortnightly update newsletter after the KS has funded to keep you abreast of the situation, decisions we have made and to show you photos of the development of the models both in regard to sculpting and their manufacture. \n\nI am 100% sure you will be 100% happy with the product on delivery! We do not plan to be a flash in the pan, take your money company. We plan to be here for the long haul and we have plenty of ambitious projects up our sleeves including the following factions for UNDERDEEP: Goblinkind, Zombie Abominations Lizardkin, Orcs, Drow, The Labyrinth, The Abyssal Realms, Gnolls, Sunsiders, Dwarven Treasure Hunters and many more... ...Not to mention our Sci-fi offering!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #82", "update_userinfo": "Final Shipping Update...", "update_content": "I have picked and packed all the packages for the miss picks and the few that did not arrive the first time round.

Thanks to the small size of the models, Bestial Wars battles are going to feel and look epic; furthermore, the limited number of bases in which miniatures are arranged will allow for fast and smooth deployment and movement. This structure makes the grand battles of Bestial Wars playable with the ease of a skirmish game!\nIn the lands of Zaneoss, monstrous hordes fight to dominate the kin living in the forgotten realms.\nThe call of battle horns echoes inside the guardian towers.\nThe enemy draws near\u2026\nZaneoss is the continent where the most ancient brood of Dabbath lives, tribes, huge reigns and hordes of hideous creatures were born and died during the ages of these bestial lands.\nThe climatic areas of the continent differ a lot, from the Northern Sea to the Seas of the West, from the lethal frost of the eternal ice of Amoth\u2019s lands to the torrid heat of the infinite sandy wastelands of the Red Desert. Most of the territory of Zaneoss consists of wild lands, huge deserts or rugged snowy mountains, civilized lands occupy just a small part of the continent.\nThe scientists of the White Tower reign have studied the migration of some of the huge birds flying over the Tentacular Sea, the Ulgurants; their path feeds hopes in theories regarding the possible existence of another continent on the east side of Zaneoss, hopes that led to many expeditions being sent to discover new lands beyond the sea, but none has ever returned.\nPLAY\n\n\nBestial Wars uses a simple game system based on colored dice: Each die is distinguished by a color that is tied to a specific success difficulty level.\nExamples:\nBlack dice are the default ones, used in most tests, they grant you success on a 4+ roll.\nWhite dice are used by heroes , they succeed on a 3+.\nPurple Dice hit on a 2+.\nEach model has a scale value indicated by small dots (also called scale degrees) placed underneath the silhouette of the model/unit in the game card.\nA model without small dots has a 0 scale value.\nThe regiment troops have scale 0 and are placed on regular 20mm x 40mm bases.\nSkirmishing troops are placed on round 30mm bases.\nHeroes and some special models are placed on round 16mm bases.\nCreatures with scale \u25cf are placed on round 30 mm bases.\nCreatures with scale \u25cf\u25cf are placed on round 40mm bases.\nCreatures with scale \u25cf\u25cf\u25cf are placed on round 50mm bases.\nCreatures with scale \u25cf\u25cf\u25cf\u25cf are placed on round 60mm bases. \nWith this kickstarter we offer you two armies of the world of Bestial Wars, the woods folk known as \u201cDefenders\u201d and their viscious rivals feared with the moniker of \u201cTentaculars\u201d.\nOn the east side of the kingdom of White Tower lies the Forest of the Ancients. This ancient and primordial land is the home of the tree men, the elves and of all the creatures of the forest. The protectors of the forest, known simply as the Defenders, are people who ignore rules of civilization, preferring to live in symbiosis with their surrounding nature, to which they are closely  bonded since birth. The inhabitants of this green kingdom are as ancient as the world, their slow paced movements are difficult to notice, they do not march for glory or to crave for power, but for the will of Cernos the ancient, for the eternal defense of the green kingdom. Worst enemies: Bestial Hordes, Tentaculars.\nIn an unknown location between the Northern Seas and the Tentacular Sea, stands the city of Yelh'rit, land of the tentacled creatures. Some scientists of the empire believe that the mysterious tentacled creatures come from a stellar progeny fallen eons ago in the depths of the deepest Tentacular Sea.\nThese amphibious creatures have the ability to create an abominable offspring from their filthy slimy carcasses; due to their shapeless bodies, the Tentaculars are versatile and fearsome warriors: some of them vomit long ranged acid regurgitation, causing panic among the enemies even before the battle has begun; others are able to collect and regenerate lethal blows. Worst enemies: Amoths, Defenders, Marinids.\nThe world of Dabbath is a dark planet inhabited by terrible creatures, some of them already begun their unstoppable march towards the realms of men and the elven forests.\n...who knows what other hideous beasts lurk in the depths of Zaneoss...\n? = the question mark if for models still in WIP stage.\nSome WIP, left to right: Q' thulu {size\u25cf\u25cf\u25cf\u25cf}, Trebuchet, Zombie and dead horse.\nAmoth\nFar north, the lands of Amoth, the ancient viking folk, are mostly covered by cold tracts of ice and rugged mountain ranges.\nThe Amoths are strong warriors, the last bastion of humanity at the northern continent\u2019s border. Thanks to their bravery and their skills in war they managed to defend themselves (at least until now) from the creatures coming from the border\u2019s mountains and from the Tentaculars, inhabitants of the most secret and inaccessible shores.\nAmid Amoths\u2019 ranks are strong barbarians, majestic giants of ice and huge mammoths, topped by heavy crowbars from which the hunters are launching their deadly ranged attacks.\nWorst enemies: The Undead, Tentaculars, Bestial Hordes, Dark Alliance.\nDwarfs\nOn the mountains of the border, by the southern side of Amoth' s Realm, lies the dwarven kingdom of Ernuat. The dwarfs of Ernuat are a folk of strong warriors and terrific miners that are able to find precious stones and any kind of metals by digging deep down the earth. It\u2019s because of their immense wealth that the dwarfs succeed in increasing the prestige of their reign and of its three cities.\nEach dwarven stronghold raises on a different mountain, they are connected by secret underground viaducts.\nThe dwarfs do business with the Amoths, in name of an old alliance renewed during the centuries. The dwarven armies are made up of formidable troops like the savage dwarfs, the golden warriors, the icy giants and the ancient juggernauts.\nWorst enemies: Bestial Hordes, Dark Alliance, inhabitants of Moloch.\nThe undead\nOn the east side of the continent of Zaneoss lies the isle of the Dead. Here, among the grim ruins of the Arnitis, strewn with corpses of the ancient folk from whom the Amoths and the White Tower folk descended, the necromancers find putrid breeding ground for their sick kind of magic.\nAlmost nothing is known about the ancestral evil which is spreading from the isle to the reigns like a cruel disease. The hated necromancers, connoisseurs of the spells of the dead, are insane experts of the occult arts who decided to embrace the studies of immortality. These outcast magicians live in the crypts of the Isle of the Dead, where the reigns have no dominions and the dead wander undisturbed, a perfect place to deepen the arts of necromancy. Zombies, skeletons, putrefied giants, cadaver devourers and vampires are the nightmare creatures who shall be faced by whom will dare to fight the dead.\nWorst enemies: none.\nBestial hordes\nThe north is mostly made of wild lands without dominions, inhabited by creatures like trolls, cyclops, wolves and goblinoids, united in tribes which moved over the years and found shelter on the mountains (their presence is recorded on both mountain ranges, Border and Groudbreak). The bestial hordes are gathered in primitive and disorganized tribes and for this reason, although their number is steadily increasing, they don\u2018t constitute a threat to the domains of other folks. These disordered groups of creatures are controlled by tribal chiefs often competing with each other; the acrimony between the various leaders does not preclude, however, that these savage hordes reach an agreement as soon as there is an opportunity to pillage and burn entire towns in order to quench their greed and amass plunder.\nWorst enemies: Dwarfs, Amoths, White Tower.\nKingdom of White Tower\nThe kingdom of White Tower is the domain of men and extends from the Border Mountains to the Groundbreak Mountains.\nThe people of White Tower, also known as \"Lords of Castles\", live in large ramparts, strong fortresses capable of resisting the sieges of terrible monsters coming from the wild lands.\nTheir domains are perhaps among the most protected of the continent, being located between the two mountain ranges of the Border and Grounbreak. Due to this strategic position it is one of the most coveted territories by the enemies\u2018 legions.\nThe kingdom of White Tower is well known for its use of great war machines with an unmatched destructive capacity; also the armored militia of the kingdom is well known, feared by enemies and loved by protected ones, which runs into battle side by side with deadly white magicians, only connoisseurs of the power of light.\nWorst enemies: Bestial Hordes, Inhabitants of Moloch, Dark Alliance.\nThe gnomes of Mirovin\nThe elves are not the only young folk to live in the shadow of the Forest of the Ancients. Near the eastern border of it, on the coast of the Enchanted Lake, in bizarre dwellings set within large old shrubs and huge mushrooms, live the gnomes of Mirovin. These harmless-looking clever little men are experts in mechanics, and thanks to this ability they were able to build formidable irrigation structures and to cultivate their land. Defenders of nature, they love to live in funny old houses set within shrubs or inside dead colossal mushrooms. The Miconids, the knights of Mirovin riding dogs or sturdy ponies, hunters, tree men and many other creatures are the defenders of this little fairy kingdom.\nWorst enemies: none\nLizardfolk\nOn the south of the Groundbreak Mountains there\u2019s the barren wasteland and even further south there\u2019s the Red Desert. At its center stands the city of Selss, whose structures are inhabited by the lizard men. Historians believe that the Lizardfolk are the oldest civilization of the continent. The customs and traditions of these creatuers are closely tied to their ancestral religion; within the titanic city of Selss there is the great temple where the Selssian priests (the highest rank in the social scale of the Lizardfolk) celebrate their masses for the snake God. The warriors of Selss march into battle joined by the desert snakes, sand dragons and other threatening creatures.\nWorst enemies: The Undead\nMinoc\nMinoc is the southernmost of the kingdoms of men and is inhabited by the descendants of the ancient people of Arniti. They are the only people to know gunpowder. The people of Minoc have always kept a neutral position during the wars of the kingdoms of the north, but the recent alliance with the kingdom of Whitetower involved them in the struggles between the northern people.\nRecently, the fearsome mobile fortress of Minoc has been spotted marching north. It\u2019s a terrifying vision of a gigantic mass of rocks and cannons, capable of devastating entire battalions, thanks also to the use of the secret weapon of the people of Minoc: gunpowder.\nWorst enemies: The Undead; Bestial Hordes; Dark Alliance.\nDark alliance\nThe camps and the towers of the dark alliance may be encountered in the most vile and hidden wild lands. The wizards exiled from the kingdom of Whitetower have found refuge in bleak and distant towers adorned with spiers and gargoyles. From these places of terror they have been able to bound alliances with the cruel and fearsome hobgoblin mercenaries. A few powerful dark wizards have tightened occult pacts with far more ungodly beings, it is not difficult to see these hordes accompanied by the powerful lords of the devils.\nWorst enemies: Whitetowerers, Amoths, Dwarfs\nThe Molochians\nThe creatures known to men as demons have appeared in the continent after the advent of the first Moloch moon, a mysterious red satellite, with irregular shape and of unknown origin. Demonologists believe that it comes directly from the hellish dimensions. The inhabitants of Moloch are an offspring of demons that due to this blasphemous satellite are able to invade the lands of men. Some of the grim inhabitants of the underworld, through the moon Moloch, have come to the hidden realms in the wilderness; rites of desecration and dark sabbaths are consumed among the ruins of the ancient temples of gods denied, waiting for the next molochian advent.\nWorst enemies: White Tower.\nDilmunians of the Atrahasis civilization\nAtrahasis the wise is he who survived the universal flood of the cosmological genesis of the \u201cOther World\u201d.\nHis immortal remains were sealed in the dabbathian world in the distant shores of the Bahrayn Island, situated on the edge of the world. Among its tropical lands you will find the legendary Dilmun, a huge city invisible to men; here the remains of Atrahasis came back to life and gave birth to the divine offspring of the Dilmunians or Xisouthrasians, as they are still called by their native worshippers who live on the island.\nA mystical civilization of ancient knowledge, jealous of its heavenly wisdom and totally indifferent to the \u201cproblems of the world\u201c; their appereance on the Zaneoss continent dates back when the Dilmunians, shortly after the discovery of the route to the mysterious island of Bahrayn, appeared in large numbers with their mighty and \u201ctechnological\u201c ships on all the shores of the Northern Sea and of the Sea of Leviathan. They arrived hiding themselves among the most indented coastlines and stayed there waiting to annihilate everyone who who dared to take the route to the kingdom of Dilmun.\nWorst enemy: none\nMerfolk {sons of Leviathan}\nIn the most hidden coasts and in the wildest islets live the creatures known as Merfolk. Few people know that these creatures as well as being formidable swimmers are also able to move on the mainland as they possess the ability to breathe in both environments. The stories of sailors tell of colossal structures, placed in the deepest oceans. Siren songs and sounds coming from the horns of the tritons, chiseled marble columns of a style remote and forgotten and altars erected in the name of the god Leviathan lead to the entry at the gates of the sunken city.\nFishmen, webbed tritons and sea dragons are just some of the creatures belonging to the great family of Merfolks.\nWorse enemies: Tentaculars\nBESTIAL WARS IS MADE IN AND SHIPS FROM ITALY.\nSHIPPING COSTS TO ITALY NEVER EXCEEDS 14$.\nCOMBINING DIFFERENT PLEDGES/SHIPPING COSTS:\nANYWHERE IN THE WORLD, ADD THE FOLLOWING $ AMOUNTS TO THE MOST EXPENSIVE SHIPPING COST :\n+2$ FOR EVERY ADDITIONAL MINIATURE PLEDGE (QUERCUS, BLIND GUARDIAN, MAMMOTH, FROST GIANT AND BERSERKERS, CYCLOPS AND GIANT WOLVES).\n+5$ FOR EVERY ADDITIONAL STARTER BOX PLEDGE.\n+8$ FOR EVERY DELUXE ARMY BOX PLEDGE.\nCUSTOMER IS RESPONSIBLE FOR CUSTOMS, DUTIES AND TAXES.\nAPPROXIMATELY 25% OF THE SHIPPING COST IS PAID BY US TO EASE FROM HARD TO PREDICT EXTRA COSTS.\nFOR QUESTIONS REACH US HERE:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/bestialwars\nbestialwars@gmail.com\nCredits\nCreated by: Danilo De Francesco and Marco Sano\n\nWith the help of Marco Sfacteria and Claudia Alizzi\n\nCollaborators: Antonio Orlando, Luigi Micalizzi, Orazio Basile, Vincenzo Cannata,  \nSculptures and rules done by: Danilo De Francesco\n2d art by: Marco Sano\nTranslation by: Mirko De Domenico & Giuseppe Rotondo\nMiniature paintings by: Danilo De Francesco e Orazio Basile\n\nPlaytesters: Danilo Danilo De Francesco, Marco Sfacteria, Marco Sano, Giorgio Fois, Lino Raccosta, Orazio Basile, Vincenzo Cannata, Antonio Orlando, Luigi Micalizzi.\nThanks to: Nino and Lino of the \u201cAntro dell\u2019orco\u201d in Messina for their support...\nDedicated to Danilo' s daugther Morgana.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nBestial Wars is a game made by long time fans of miniature games.\nMost of the miniatures for the \u201cDefenders\u201d and \u201cTentaculars\u201d armies have been already sculpted and their master molds been made, we will check our miniature production as closely as possible looking out for casting errors, confident in delivering a high quality product.\nThe most realistic and common risk we might face is delivery delays, but we did most of the job ahead just so we could reduce if not prevent it from happening.\nOur goal is to give new life to 12mm wargaming with a project that has been developed and tested with love and care.\nThanks for your support!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Marco Sano\n2 created \u00b7 15 backed"}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #8", "update_userinfo": "Thank you for believing in Bestial Wars!", "update_content": "Bestial Wars thanks everybody who believed in this project and supported it, although we failed on kickstarter, we are not giving up, other options to release the game have been and will be considered, self producing it seems the most likely one.

Learn more about us on www.lords-of-war.com!\nVery excitingly, we have recently done deals with Heidelberger Spielverlag in Germany and ACD Distribution in the United States, with the German Language version of Lords of War having been released on Thursday last week.\nThe German Edition had SOLD OUT by the Saturday of the world's largest game show - The Spiel - which happened last weekend. We were there and had a great time!!\nOur busy booth at The Spiel. See a full gallery of photos on https://www.facebook.com/BBG.lordsofwar\nWe also attended WynterCon in Eastbourne in the UK from Friday 31st October-Sunday 2nd November. If you came along and met us, THANK YOU - and if you were one of the people who pushed us over the 100% Funded line, THANK YOU SO SO SO MUCH!!!\nOur team of AMAZING volunteers.\nUp until now, every Lords of War game has been designed to work on its own, completely independently of the others, although you have always been able to play any of the armies against one another or mix the decks up to build balanced Mercenary armies!\nWith Lords of War: Magic and Monsters, we're adding a HUGE amount of new stuff to Lords of War in the form of our first full Deck Expansions!\nIf you know the game, you're going to love what we have planned. If you've never heard of us, now is the time to jump on board!\nWhat are we offering?\nOur first objective was to fund the first Lords of War: Magic and Monsters game THIS HAS BEEN ACHIEVED!!! We will now be able to get it to backers and retailers in time for Christmas.\nIf we manage to significantly exceed our funding goal, we know EXACTLY what we would do next...\nPledge \u00a350 or more and if we reach \u00a316,000 you'll get Lords of War: Elves versus Lizardmen 2 FOR FREE in April 2015!!!\nAnd what that means in practice is:\nNew Rules!\nNew Victory Conditions!\nNew Special Card Functions!\nDozens of New Cards!\nSpell Tokens!\nNew Lords of War Stories!\nWhat do you mean \"Lords of War Stories?\"\nLords of War is made all the more unique by its ever-expanding Story and World.\nYou can read all about the Lore of Lords of War on our website, including over 30 stories and over 100 Unit Histories!\nAlternatively, listen to the Volume I of The Lords of War: Orcs versus Dwarves Audio Book for free on YouTube!\nPLUS, you can now listen to Volume I of the Lords of War: Elves versus Lizardmen Audiobook too!! \nSo, how much does everything cost?\nWell, for the brand new Orcs versus Dwarves: Magic and Monsters...\nFor any one of the original Lords of War packs:\n***NEW EXTRAS JUST ADDED!!!!***\nHow about a WHOLE NEW Lords of War game-play variant?!\nIt's an AMAZING deal!!!\nAnd if you don't want them all, buy in sets of Faction Command Card groups!!\nHow about all the Orc Commanders as Shinies?!?\n Or perhaps the Dwarves?!?!\nPerhaps the Elves?!?\n How about the Lizardmen?!?\n What about the Templars?!?\n We can't forget about - the Undead?!?\nSo, that's each for \u00a35 or ALL 6 for \u00a320!!!!\nThen also, for the Lords of War: Weather and Terrain Expansion Pack...\nPlus there's the Luxury Battle Mats!\nFoam-backed and beautiful...\nThe Orc! ***EXCLUSIVE!!!***\nThe Dwarf! ***EXCLUSIVE!!!***\nThe Sepia Terrain! ***NEW!!!!***\nThe Templar! ***NEW!!!***\nAnd, of course...\nThe Undead!\nAnd, finally, the Lords of War Card Tin!\nWait! I'm new to the game! Explain the core Lords of War mechanic in 10 seconds!\nSee this diagram?\nThe full rules are also available through the Lords of War pages on Board Game Geek.\nSee how every card has a shield containing a Defence Value?\nSee how each card has a series of numbers in their Attack Arrows on the edges or corners?\nPlayers play one card at a time from their hand, using their cards' Attack Arrows to exceed the Defence Value on their opponent's cards.\nIn the above example, the Orc Butcher is DEAD (4 from the Chariot + 1 from the Spearman = 5 against the Orc Butcher's 4 Defence).\nThat's the mechanic in 10 seconds.\nThere's a lot more to the game, including special rules for Berserker, Spear, Ranged, Cavalry, Magic, Monstrous and Flying Units, but that's the absolute basics. \nLearn more about what these symbols mean on our website, www.lords-of.war.com!\nTry checking out these Rules Videos for a full explanation!\nIs Lords of War any good?\nSo far, Lords of War has won the award for Best Strategic Card Games at the UK Games Expo - the UK's largest gaming convention - as well as being reviewed very positively by several websites and magazines.\nClick on the following names to read some reviews from these reputable websites - The Geek Syndicate, Beasts of War, Polyhedron Collider, The Little Metal Dog Show and Boardgames in Blighty.\nHere is a review video from Board To Death:\nHere's another from GMS Magazine:\nHere's a brilliant Lords of War bit from Board With Life:\nAnd here are some testimonial quotes:\n\"This is a great game that is perfect for first timers or hard-core gamers because of the rules, the design, the art and the fun factor. 5/5\"\n- The Geek Syndicate\n\"Plenty of tactical depth and oodles of replay value... I can quite honestly say this is one of the best-looking games you'll ever play.\"\n- Beasts of War\n\"Lords of War, is a really great game and it doesn't matter whether you're a seasoned card shark or totally new to gaming. The mechanics are simple enough to learn it quickly but the strategy is complex enough to make you want to play again and again.\"\n- No Pun Included\n\"Lords of War is shaping up to be one of the best games of the year and is just starting its journey; I suggest you get on board.\"\n- Polyhedron Collider\n\"It demands a lot more thought than some games ten times the size and four times the price, but one thing you won\u2019t need to consider is whether to grab a copy or not \u2013 your answer should be a simple yes.\"\n- The Little Metal Dog Show\n\"Lords of War absolutely SHINES at what it is trying to be. The design is tight and the restraint shown to keep it simple and fast playing is to be commended.\"\n- Boardgames in Blighty\n\"Lords of War has consistently improved with each new army and now with this set they have issued a loud challenge to all would be contenders.\"\n- Who Dares Rolls\nWhat new Unit Types will be introduced in this edition?\nGhalt, the continent over which the Orcs and Dwarves are warring...\nAlongside more of the Unit Types and Ranks you know and love, we are introducing some new mechanics to Lords of War which are well and truly game-changing!\nLords of War: Magic and Monsters ALSO adds Moving Units into the armies which did not have them before, starting with - of course - the Orcs and Dwarves!\nMagic Units\nMagic Units are a major addition to Lords of War - not least because they introduce Tokens to the game!\nEach Lords of War Faction contains multiple Magic Units in its Magic and Monsters Expansion, with each Faction having unique spells that only they can cast.\nFor the Dwarves for example, harnessing the Icy Winds of the North, their Magic Units can either deal +1 Ice Damage to their foes (Damage which lingers, even if the Magic Unit Retreats or is Eliminated) or they can cast +1 Shield onto allied Units!\nThe Orc Magic Units meanwhile can cast +1 Fire Damage or they ALSO have the power to turn ANY Orc Unit into a Berserker, enabling them to rampage across the battlefield and achieve multi-elimination combos!\nMagic Units with Ranged capability have another MAJOR advantage: they can Fire even if Engaged!\n*Note: Magic Units can deal Ranged damage *OR* cast a spell in their turn, not both!\nHere's a Tutorial Video:\nMonstrous Units\nMonstrous Units bring a whole new level of strategic thinking to Lords of War. Not only can they all Move but, as you can see, they also have a Monstrous Defence Value.\nThe trick with the Monstrous Defence is that no Attack Arrow which deals EQUAL OR LESS THAN a Monstrous Unit's Monstrous Defence can damage that Monstrous Unit.\nWeaker Units might be able to Engage them but your heavy damage Units will be needed to actually Eliminate them.\nYou'll now need to really think twice before you play out your high damage Units!\nHere's a Tutorial Video!\nFlying Units\nFlying Units are crafty creatures primarily used to interrupt your opponent's strategies.\nWhat makes them unique is that, despite having low Shield Values, they can ONLY be damaged or Engaged by Ranged Units or other Flying Units.\nThey may seem small but they are MAJOR pests!\nHere's a Tutorial Video!\nOrc Mage Command Card Xnurl Firebelly, now in colour. He's disgustingly beautiful!!!\nWhat else is new?\nRagar Icebone - one of the new Dwarf Command Cards.\nIn addition to the above, each Faction will also be given more Special Units, more Elite Units, more Command Cards *AND* players will now hold 7 rather than 6 cards in their hand.\nThe Victory Conditions for Lords of War matches also change with the inclusion of Lords of War: Magic and Monsters:\n- With your deck expanded to 54 cards, players now need to take 30 cards to win a match!\n- With 8 Command Cards now in the deck, players now need to Eliminate 6 enemy Command Cards in order to earn a Command Card Victory!\nAnd now let's take a closer look at those T-Shirts...\nSo, \u00a316,000 is the new goal... will you help us make this happen?!?!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe're trying to get Lords of War: Orcs versus Dwarves 2 out in time for Christmas.

Your choices each become part of the myth, joining your tribe's pantheon of heroes. How will you be remembered by your tribe in generations to come?\nMoon Hunters is a 1-4 player action RPG with a rich, ancient world that's different every time you play. Build your mythology as you play, solo or with friends, every action and choice contributing to your legend.  \n  An ancient, occult world: the gods and their creations yet walk among us, and our prayers do not always go unanswered, for better or for worse. \nLocal co-op like never before: playing alone is fully supported. But if you invite your friends, you won't just be bashing enemies, you'll be creating legends together. \nBuild your mythology: Your actions show if you are more of a Trickster or a Saviour or something else entirely. At the end of your journey worthy heroes become a constellation in the night sky, your deeds recounted for the ages. \nDifferent worlds, persistent myths: Seeing one aspect of the mystery in its entirety only takes a couple of hours, but to truly understand what's happened, you'll need to play a few times. Meanwhile, each time you play, the constellation of your character's legend carries over, as part of your tribe's developing pantheon.\nYou could describe the game as \u201cLegend of Zelda meets Castle Crashers\u201d, or maybe \u201cKing of Dragon Pass meets Gauntlet\u201d. We empower players to experiment with their personality through the reputation and tribe-management, while combat challenges punctuate the journey as chances to prove their skill.\nWe already have permission to create the game on Steam for PC and Mac, due to our previous success with Shattered Planet. A DRM-free version will be available on the Humble Store. We're hoping to release Moon Hunters in Summer 2015. If you want to be notified of Moon Hunters updates and development progress, sign up here!\nIf you're a little confused, you can also try out Dungeons of Fayte, by Brent Ellison and our designer Tanya Short, available for free download. It has the co-op action RPG and town-management components. We're taking the Dungeons of Fayte design as a base, adding mythology/reputation and a randomised world as icing on top, like a delicious RPG cake!\n More stretch goals will be revealed as the campaign progresses!\nEach \"journey\" takes only a couple of hours, allowing you to explore one small aspect of the story. Upon completing each journey, if you're worth remembering, your hero will be remembered as a constellation in the night sky, symbolising their contribution to the world's history.\nAlong your journey, your decisions show your personality and create your reputation. Donating blood to a dying stranger shows you are Selfless. Flirting shamelessly with everyone demonstrates you are Flirtatious. And so on -- we will support over 50 different personality traits in the final game, each of which has its own effect on the world around you.\nIn the real world, as in Moon Hunters, legends are rarely about merely defeating villains. More often, folktales are the story of the Clever hero that tricked the gods into giving humans fire. Of the Loyal hero that ventured into the underworld to save a loved one's soul. Of the Brave hero that declined a god's advances, and suffered for impertinence.  \nYour choices determine how you are remembered, and what you embody to those who hear your story in ages hence. The reason why you do something can be as important as the act itself.   \nIn the world of Moon Hunters, the holy Moon is the source of all life and good, worshipped by every tribe as the central goddess of the pantheon. When the Moon does not rise one evening, heroes across the land take up the search, hoping to uncover the truth before the evil Sun's power grows too strong.\nThe world of Moon Hunters is randomly generated every time you play, but there are certain key elements of the setting and lore that are constant.\nFor example, while the individual members and conflicts of the Dustfolk village will be different depending on your generated world, the Dustfolk will always be the tribe of the sands. Learning their general beliefs and customs will give you an advantage in negotiations.\nThere are three major biomes (desert, mountains, and forests), and one minor (cave systems), each with their own local tribes:\nThe Dustfolk tribe keeps turkeys and camels when prosperous. The deserts are unforgiving, but the Seeker's Blood magic mastery helps the tribe find life-giving water.\nThe High Tribes live in wind-blown canyon country, looking down on the rest of creation from their high vantage point. The mountains are desolate but rich in minerals.\nThe Wolf Clan is the most secretive of all tribes, closely guarding their knowledge of Wild magic, so as not to lose the trust of the creatures they ally with.\nStretch goal unlocked! The Celestin are nomadic traders, following the rivers from source to mouth and back again in annual patterns. They are said to have over a thousand rituals to govern their decision-making, but most are invisible to outsiders.\nStretch goal unlocked! The Reefwalkers follow the Moon's tides and bring a wide variety of ingredients and goods to trade from their distant island homes.\nCalled the First People by some, the Silkhood are the only non-humans in the world of Moon Hunters. Although they welcome visitors, their customs and hierarchies are nearly incomprehensible at first.\n All player character classes wield all of the elements, but start with an affinity. You can customise your character's name and colour palette from the start. As you play you'll discover new special attacks to choose between.\nThe Witch trains under the Dustfolk Seeker in the ways of Blood magic. Blood is the element of life and death. When the world was created, the blood of the Goddess flowed to form the rivers and oceans.\nThe Witch has a basic melee attack and a high-damage ranged attack, making her useful in just about any situation.\nThe Spellblade learns the art of Bronze magic from a High Tribes expert smith. Bronze magic allows the shaping of metals, following the rhythm and grace of war as technologies develop. When the world was created, the bones of the Goddess broke to form the mountains and metals.\nIn combat, the Spellblade is a fierce melee fighter and has the highest endurance.\nThe Occultist's connection to Shadow magic allows her to bend the fabric of space and time to suit her whim. Somewhere between math and poetry lies the truth of the human condition. When the world was created, the Goddess's hair draped over the world, darkening the night sky.\nThe Occultist is a long-range, quick fighter with the most control over enemy positioning and movement.\nThe Druid is the prodigal child of the Wolf Clan, who closely guard all secrets of Wild magic. Wild magic is the primal knowledge from before fairness and language, back to the laws of instinct. When the world was created, the Goddess told stories and from her words, all of its wild creatures sprang forth.\nDruids are the most flexible fighters, sometimes even shape-shifting to meet the unique demands of each encounter.\nStretch goal unlocked! As an initiated priestess of the Moon, the Songweaver understands each of the elements, bringing together Wild harmonies, Blood rhythms, Dark dissonance, and Bronze strength. When the world was created, we invented music to remember and mourn.\nThe Songweaver is a complex support class. It is not technically impossible to play as her alone, but without a friend, you're in for a challenge.\nAs for non-player-characters, Teller Roa is the most widely-respected priestess of the Moon. It is she who decides whether your journey's tale is worth keeping for future generations, and what role you play in the legends of our time. Moon worship is a largely oral tradition, depending on the telling of stories to keep its ancient knowledge alive.\nMeanwhile, self-appointed \"King\" Mardokh believes he has seen a greater Truth than the Moon has to offer, and his fine writings have caused chaos in nearby territories. \nThe music is nearly as important to us as the art style, and luckily, we have some unique talent lined up.

They seem to be hard-working, diligent and professional and Moon Hunters looks engaging, unique and accessible. Square Enix Collective is very happy to support the team\u2019s crowdfunding campaign, and we believe that Kitfox have the skills and capabilities to make the game they\u2019re describing in this pitch.\u201d You can download and read the full Team Assessment at your leisure.\nWe're not getting money from Square Enix. Square Enix is just helping us find our players -- you! We're just four devs trying to scrape by and make a game. Without a big marketing budget, we need all the help we can get! \nYou can read a deeper discussion of why we think partnering with the S.E. Collective is worthwhile at CinemaBlend. Essentially, we want to make a game, and we want to make sure that the people who would love it get a chance to hear that it exists.\nIf you are into RPGs and/or mythology and/or old-fashioned co-op fun, Moon Hunters is the game for you. \nWe are four upstarts that, despite our modest successes in the game industry, don't have savings to fall back on in times of need. To put it bluntly, we're poor, and Moon Hunters is our dream game to make. We can't do it alone. \nPhoto credit: Belziir Photography\n We need your help to make Moon Hunters the best game it can be. We'll use your money to develop the game's programming, art, music, and design for longer and with more help than we could normally dream of affording. Besides, if nobody likes it and we don't get funded, we might be heartbroken, but at least it saves us from spending a year eating cans of beans making a game that people don't want! Win/win! \nThis is also a great opportunity to get feedback and input from players that would normally be impossible. We look forward to working with enthusiastic fans to make the game of our dreams together. \nWe try not to let the Canadian winter keep us down...\nSo, if Moon Hunters seems like the kind of game you might want to play, please consider chipping in and spreading the word! \nWe're still in the prototyping phase of production, so there's a lot of game left to make. But we're covering most of it! We decided to take the sales money from Shattered Planet and our company savings to help cover licenses, software, traveling to conferences, and most of the core team salaries, if this Kickstarter succeeds. \nThe money will be spent as follows:  \nFirst, 5% goes to Kickstarter, 3% goes to Visa/Mastercard/Amazon, and 19% goes to Quebec/Canadian taxes.\nThen, 5% goes to Square Enix. \nWe estimate it will take between $5000 and $7000 to handle production and shipping of all of the backer rewards (depending on which tiers are more popular), or about 12%\nThat leaves us the remaining $22,000 or so to spend on audio, more art, a content designer, and additional programmer time.\nThe core team members of Kitfox are the same core team from developing Shattered Planet, which was developed from idea to release on four platforms in 13 months (Windows, Mac, iOS, Android). It received praise from The New Yorker, CNET, and others, and remains highly praised on Steam. It was also chosen to be at the Indie Megabooth at PAX Prime 2014!\n And who are we?

They are safe to wash, though we don't recommend using them as a BBQ bib, okay?\nThe Digital Art Book will include the concept art of Moon Hunters. You will get a hand-picked collection of beautiful watercolour artworks in a neatly designed PDF file. It includes some exclusive early concepts that we haven't shown to anyone!\nHere's a visual guide to all the tiers and rewards in their pixel glory:\nIf you can't find the perfect tier, why not build your own?\nDuring checkout, add the following amounts manually to your total pledge.

In Underdeep only the cunning or the strongest survive. You will need both to ensure your future in the Underdeep is secure\u2026 at least for now.\nUnderdeep is a fast paced action miniatures game where players take control of an Overlord and his retinue of minions, champions, brutes and titans. These words are used to describe a unit type used in the game, each of which has different uses and abilities to help you win the battles you fight. The miniatures used are 30mm in scale and available in high quality plastic, resin and white metal. This is not to say that all of the models used are this size, it is just a measure of scale and reflects the height of an average human male from the soles of his shoes to his eyes. Enormous Zombie Hulks and Bugbears for example are much bigger than humans and although they are still in the 30mm scale, they maybe 50mm tall or even taller! It is up to you as a player to pick a faction that you like, collect the miniatures you want to fight your battles with and paint them to bring them to life! As an Overlord you might be a Goblin Chieftain looking to expand his tribe\u2019s holdings or to increase his status within his tribe by leading a scouting force into the enemy\u2019s lair. You could also take the role of a Lizardkin Khan looking to steal human slaves from an isolated farmstead or even an evil \nNecromancer intent on forming an army of insidious zombies or flesh golems to wreak havoc on the denizens of the Underdeep and Sunsiders alike. It doesn\u2019t matter why. All that matters is that your minions answer the call to arms and crush the enemy!!! One of the unique features of Underdeep is its \u201cscale-ability\u201d. This means it is viable to play with as many or as few miniatures as you would like. It is essentially a skirmish level war-game and most battles will utilise only 25 or 50 figures. However, the rules allow you to play with multiple Overlords each taking control of a Cadre of warriors. This means that battles with hundreds of miniatures a side is possible and is often an inspiring goal that many gamers hope to attain.\nThe best starting point, after choosing your faction, is to pick an Overlord. Battle parameters are decided before a game is played to define how big the forces being used will be. Most games will be around 250 points for a game that can be easily completed in an hour. Bigger games will take proportionally longer to complete. 500 points for example could take a couple of hours to complete but would allow a larger scope of creatures to be used. There are various points levels of Overlords available and their points cost is a direct reflection of how powerful they are on the field of battle. For example, if you were to pick a Goblin Chieftain to be your Overlord for 25 points his effectiveness on the battlefield will not be as dramatic as that of the Goblin King who costs 50 points! It is important to point out that Overlords are the most important unit in your force. Without them your force begins to fight less effectively and will lose much of its co-ordination. In some cases it can cause your army to flee field, so highly are they held in regard! However, this does not mean that you can protect your Overlord by having him hide away behind your must powerful units\u2026 Most Overlords have dramatic and potent powers that can only be accessed when in the thick of combat. That\u2019s just the way it is down here\u2026 only the strongest survive.\nUnderdeep uses a randomised command and control system which means your battle plans have to be fluid and are often subject to change quickly as situations arise that you had not plan for. Tactically the game is immensely challenging. You will find the game easy to play and to learn but difficult to master. The aim of the game is to learn the best tactics to use and when, as what works against one enemy will fail against another.\nSo don your armour and sharpen your axe, call your troops to arms\u2026 the Underdeep awaits you warrior\u2026\nMorn is a desolate world. Many centuries ago a cataclysmic war raged across the world. Man, Elf and Dwarf formed vast armies to combat the scourge from below, the armies of the Underdeep. The Underdeep had long been a source of conflict for the races know as the Sunsiders. Many rare and precious metals, stone and jewels lay beneath their feet and it was during these ventures that the two worlds collided. One world of light... the other of Darkness.  \nThe World of Morn\nEventually a dark entity united the squabbling races of the Underdeep and a vast host poured forth to take vengeance on the Sunsiders. The war lasted for fifty years. Nations were vanquished, Kings slaughtered and races bought to the very brink of extinction. However, the forces of light prevailed and the creatures of the Underdeep were forced back down into the depths. Now, hundreds of years later Sunside has still not recovered. The Elves have withdrawn to their citadels, the dwarves have fortified their mine cities and the few human kingdoms that remain hide behind their enormous walls. The once proud kingdoms are now wilderness punctuated with small towns and villages with no one to rely on for protection but themselves. \n And once again evil stirs in the deep...\nThe world of Morn awakens to a new day. The sun slowly rises over the mountains and spills its golden glow on a land recovering from eons of war. Farmers till the land, shepherds tend the flocks and the good folk of the world grapple with the toils the day will bring. Deep below the surface world there is no dawn... only darkness. The Sunsiders think their lives are hard but food is plentiful, resources abundant and the dawn brings new hope.  \nThe Underdeep has no such hope...only the strong survive and the strong must fight for everything. The darkness holds many races, some pushed into the caves and dark places of the world by the Sunsiders, other races have always dwelt in the shadows. They vie for supremacy, King versus King, tribe versus tribe, clan versus clan. The only thing that unites these creatures is their lust for conquest, their need for revenge on the surface world. That day will come, but for now they must battle for control of the UNDERDEEP.\n We have managed to discount our shipping costs dramatically to the US/EUROZONE and the ROW.  We are offering FREE shipping to the UK!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs with most projects there are some risks and challenges that can beset a project like ours.\n\nThe two main areas of importance for me are the following:\n\n* QUALITY OF SERVICE\n\n* QUALITY OF PRODUCT\n\nAs a buyer of miniatures, boardgames, rpgs and other table top games over the last 25 years I understand what makes a quality product. The main reason we decided to work with Renedra was down to quality. I was given cheaper options but I wasn't happy with the production quality of the finished article I had seen elsewhere.\n\nWe have worked closely with Renedra to agree a tooling schedule, costs, and delivery times and I am 100% confident we will have the finished product by September 2015 for the plastic sprues.\n\nThe reason for the long wait is down to the production methods involved in making the tools (they are hand crafted not CNC made) and also down to the busy schedule of Renedra such is the demand for their services.\n\nIf you are not familiar with Renedra and the companies they currently produce miniatures for I suggest you visit their website at \n\nhttp://www.renedra.co.uk/index.php\n\nOrders for Resin and metal models will be turned around a lot faster than the estimated years for the plastic sprues. We would hope to have the majority of metal and resin models out to customers by April 2015 at the latest. However, we will not split packages to enable you to get your resin/metal miniatures before your plastics unless you pay for the shipping.\n\nWe plan to do a weekly/fortnightly update newsletter after the KS has funded to keep you abreast of the situation, decisions we have made and to show you photos of the development of the models both in regard to sculpting and their manufacture.\n\nWe already have commitment from Renedra to give you photographic updates from their factory through each stage of tool making process.\n\nYes, you will have to wait a little while for your models. But I am 100% sure you will be 100% happy with the product on delivery!\n\nWe do not plan to be a flash in the pan, take your money company.

Dialogue scenes become a chance to explore and discover clues on a character\u2019s person and reveal whether they are a witness or a suspect. Curiosity is rewarded with captivating animations and goodies, making for a richer experience and a living world. It\u2019s not just pretty, it\u2019s alive!\nAs you solve mini-mysteries, and put the pieces of Dean Strausberry's murder together, you start to unravel a much bigger mystery\u2026\nExplore the abandoned mines, the forgotten graveyard, the misty mountains. Sneak into the police station evidence room. Wander the shops on Main Street and chat up the baristas at the coffee shop. Dig through the archives of Gumboldt University's Library.\n Jenny LeClue, a young detective, brilliant, spunky, irreverent, with a fierce sense of independence.\nArthur K Finkelstein, The Author, acts as narrator and will guide you if you lose your way. You also have the opportunity to help him and Jenny change the story, permanently, as it evolves. This doesn\u2019t just occur in your own playthrough, but will also affect the way future episodes are written and crafted for everyone. This is choosiness on a massive scale. You choose, together.\nHenry LeClue, Jenny\u2019s dad and the police medical examiner. He is a kind and caring man, but has separated from Jenny and her mom. He has not been seen or heard from in several months for reasons that are still a mystery.\nJulie LeClue, Jenny\u2019s mom and a former CSI who now teaches criminology at Gumboldt University. She\u2019s the only witness and number one suspect to Dean Strausberry\u2019s shocking murder.\nSheriff LeClue, Jenny\u2019s grandfather, is a stoic old-school kind of guy.\nDean Strausberry is the soon-to-retire head of Gumboldt University. He\u2019s a jolly gentlemen often seen shaking hands and kissing babies around town. \nCool Keith, your best friend, usually found around Mr Beans, the coffee shop on Main Street. He will patiently listen to your ridiculous theories about what's really going on in Arthurton. He also has a really cute dog!\nSuzie Glatz, your cousin, frenemy, and secret nerd genius. If you need a newfangled gadget beyond your wits and handy notebook, she's your best bet.\nMr Glatz, a prominent business man in town, and Jenny\u2019s uncle. He\u2019s definitely charismatic but something about him doesn\u2019t sit right with Jenny.\nJJ - Stock up on supplies and other thingamabobs in his overfilled junkyard. As JJ always tells Jenny \"One man's junk is another mans detective kit!\" If you want to upgrade your flashlight, he\u2019s got you covered. Bring him something weird and he might even give you a special reward.\nThese are just a few of the main characters, but there are even more curious citizens of Arthurton to interact with and investigate!\nDelve into a metanarrative and the story layers between The Author, Jenny, and you. Themes include family, loss, identity, redemption, and authorship. This is a story about a young girl, who is confident and in control of part of her life, but insecure in her personal relationships.\nThe story is influenced by my love for Mystery, Horror, and Sci-Fi. Some of my favorite inspirations ( in no particular order ): Twin Peaks, Professor Layton, Broken Age, Resident Evil, Veronica Mars, Ghost Trick, Limbo, Hot Fuzz, Encyclopedia Brown, Clue, Sherlock, Blue Velvet, Are You Afraid Of The Dark, The Silent Age, Kentucky Route Zero, CSI.\nSo why Kickstarter? Because I can\u2019t do it alone\u2026I need you! I need the help of a larger community in order to realize the dream of producing episode one of the Jenny LeClue Trilogy. Storytelling is my passion, and the wonderful Kickstarter community offers the possibility of creating a broader and deeper story than I have the resources to craft on my own.\nI have designed the environments and characters, outlined the story, and the game is ready to be brought to life.\nThis is the story I want to tell as an artist. This is the game I've always wanted to play as a gamer. This is the project I've been excited about making for years, and now we are ready to make that dream a reality. But we can\u2019t do it without your help!\nThese reward images are conceptual renderings.\nThe plan is to have episode one scripted and the game in alpha by Spring '15. This would allow us to time to create final art, animation, sound, music, polish the game, and possibly add voice acting for a launch in Winter '15. If there is enough support for episode two or three, these will follow after. \nThe game requires continued writing, storyboarding, design, game design, illustration, coding, modeling of sets, character rigging, character animation, sound design, music composition, and with the stretch goals, voice talent. All these things are needed to complete the game and this requires focus and time, critical luxuries as a freelancer. The initial goal will afford me these two opportunities. The higher stretch goals will open the doors to a fully realized version with all the bells and whistles and potentially the completion of all three episodes.\nPaying Skilled and Passionate Artists - This is a passion project for me, but other friends and professionals need to be compensated for their tremendous talents. Having a developer, illustrator, as well as an animator on Jenny LeClue would lighten the workload considerably and allow me to concentrate on the overall storytelling and design of the game.\nCompany and Operating Costs - Operating a business, Licensing, Equipment, Living Costs and Bills require a fair chunk of money and time.\nTesting, Refining, and Polishing - Beta testing, integrating Feedback from the Community, and using everything that I have to produce a game I've been dreaming of for years.\n These talented people have all contributed to the project in various ways.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nJenny LeClue is a big idea with a lot of moving pieces. A project of this scope is indeed a challenge, but I live for challenges. It's a big mountain to climb, but we have the tools, and with your support we can make it happen.\n\nMy 10 years of experience as a motion designer, director, and developer has allowed me to hone and polish my skills as a writer, programmer, animator, designer, illustrator and visual storyteller. Every project and every day presents a new problem-solving challenge.\n\nI also previously Kickstarted FATHOMS, a very long short film. I did everything on the project including writing, directing, modeling, animating, editing, sound design and compositing.\n\nI have also developed several iOS apps, including Anatomy In Motion, a top selling educational app and Facebook community with over 180,000 followers. I have also successfully designed and developed iOS apps, games, web, and mobile experiences using javascript for private clients and personal projects. Other team contributors have experience developing flash games, and iOS apps and games using Obj-C.\n\nWe are building the game using Unity, and have a few prototypes in production. I\u2019ve previously done all the development work myself, but the hope is with enough support we could bring on a dedicated Unity developer. This will allow me more time to focus specifically on the core game, art, and story experience.\n\nThe biggest benefits of using Unity are a trusted engine with a lot of 1st & 3rd-party support. More importantly, Unity is very flexible, and will make it much easier to support other platforms in the future including: iOS, Android, PS4, Vita.\n\nI'm super excited to go on this adventure together and climb that mountain!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #91", "update_userinfo": "PHYSICAL REWARDS & A BIG UPDATE COMING SOON!", "update_content": "Hello detectives!

Aegis Defenders takes place in a world where a great war has wiped humanity's memory clean of its once technologically advanced past. Once commonplace items like microwaves are seen as black magic. Humanoid artificial intelligence that demonstrate supernatural strength and intellect are regarded as gods.\nThe core story is about the relationship between Bart and his granddaughter Clu (Yes. She's a girl). Many years ago, their home was destroyed by the demi-god Shem, one of the robotic gods who has been programmed to preserve the lives of his people at any cost, and now Shem is expanding his dominion once again.\nAegis Defenders focuses on their journey to stop Shem from invading their new home of Mu by finding Aegis, a mythical weapon said to endow its bearer absolute power.\n\"The machine does not isolate man from the great problems of nature but plunges him more deeply into them.\" - Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry, Wind, Sand, and Stars\n Bart the Engineer\nA tinkerer with knowledge of the old world, Bart's determination and ability to bring relics back to life is second to none - even when it is deemed forbidden. Despite his carefree exterior, Bart is burdened with a heavy guilt from his past.\nBart's Arsenal\nAs an engineer, Bart is able to craft static defenses like turrets, barriers, and drones.\nBart isn't great at melee combat but he wields a giant hammer that can be used for melee combat in a pinch. \nWhen not the active character, Bart's passive ability is to repair nearby structures.\nClu the Hunter\nAs an orphan whose parents were killed by the Empire, Clu has difficulty trusting others and puts others at a distance with her her sharp tongue and knack for sarcasm. The lucky few that she does befriend, however, she loves absolutely.\nClu's Arsenal\nClu wields a variety of powerful firearms - ranging from crossbows that can shoot platformable bolts to shotguns with powerful knockback.\nFrom explosive mines to slow fields, Clu can be set deadly traps that offer a wide range of utility.\nClu's passive ability is continual fire, allowing her to function like a mobile turret.\n  Energi Glubs - Remnants of an ancient power source known as Energi, these gelatinous foes live only to eat and will devour your turrets and defenses like candy.\nThe Order of Shem - The Empire's foot-soldiers always travel in groups and must be dispatched of from afar. Their long spears and hardened shields make them impossible to approach up close.\nCheck out more enemies on our Tumblr!\nArachnis the Spider Queen - Fun fact about Arachnis and her children: their butts are shaped like fruit. At the right angle, the babies look like peaches and the queen looks like a dragon fruit. Yummy!\nRagworm of the Nereis Desert - These blind critters have acute hearing and will attack anything that sounds like it might be dinner. A more prudent engineer might be able to lure these guys out with kamikaze drones.\n Mysty Mines \n\"The eye by long use comes to see even in the darkest cavern.\"  - George Berkeley\nNereis Desert\n\"One sits down on a desert sand dune, sees nothing, hears nothing.

Many Infamy: Welcome to The Big Smoke characters are based on famous individuals from literature and history, but given a steampunk twist.\n\nAn alternate Victorian London in turmoil through the development of advanced new technology. The city is packed with intriguing stories, fascinating characters and a deep history, making for a rich steampunk setting.\nBy backing and sharing this Kickstarter you can:\nGrab yourself a fine haul of beautiful, high-quality miniatures at a reduced price.\nHelp develop the range and enable the world of Infamy: Welcome to The Big Smoke to flourish. \nBe a vital cog (pardon the pun) in the refinement of the rules.\nGet backer-exclusive early access to the living rulebook, from its alpha phase onward.\nProvide feedback and suggestions on any of the rules, skills and stats, or simply enjoy playing the game before anyone else! \nGet the Kickstarter exclusive miniature - Nikola Tesla - only available through this campaign!\nIf you want to know more, here's two hours of me gibbering on about Infamy: Welcome to The Big Smoke!\nGameplay video #1 - The Card Deck\nGameplay video #2 - Pre-game setup and playing out a turn\n Gameplay Video #3 - Finishing up the game \nTo help you decide I've made a guide for each Kingpin (the leader of your gang) to give you an idea of their strengths and weaknesses. In addition there's a recommendation of a miniature that's a perfect pairing for them, and a list of some other models who will work well in their gang.\nDon't forget, other than needing a Kingpin in charge, you can mix and match all of the models, so there's tons of versatility.\nClick on the Kingpins below to see more!\n   Infamy miniatures are bespoke 32mm scale steampunk models, sculpted in amazing detail and cast in high-quality resin by experts with decades of experience. \nThe models in this campaign are split into different categories, determined by both the size and complexity of the kit - Regular, Large and X-Large. The number of minis you can choose from each category is determined by the Pledge that you choose.\nYou can add as many extra miniatures to your Pledge as you desire. Simply add the cost of them to your overall total.\nMiniatures are shown as finished products or traditional sculpts where possible. Digital renders of the models will be printed on an Envisiontec Perfactory (the best machine in the world for fine-detail printing). Other models shown are concept art and where possible, I will list the sculptor who is due to do the sculpt.\nThe miniatures come with round lipped bases.\nChoosing models\nWhen building a gang it is wise to have a balance of Specialisms - Intelligence, Skill, Strength and Technology. For this reason I have added the symbols next to each miniature. Some Kingpins have special rules that mean they adjust the balance of gangs (eg. Tesla can take more Technology based models without penalty to efficiency). I will make these clearer toward the end of the campaign. If you need to alter or add to your choices at any point, even after the campaign has finished, it will be really easy to do so!\n                                                                                                                Multi-award winning painter Ben Komets will guide you through his painting process on the Cavalier Rocketeer, covering basing, painting, detailing, and more.\nThis model will only ever be available with the DVD so don't miss out on an awesome mini and an amazing way to improve your painting!\n(It's also a bit of a bargain, if I do say so myself! Please note that the cover image is not final.)\nPledges to this Kickstarter vary greatly, from as little as \u00a31 for 'Digital', all the way up to the 'Lifer!' pledge.\n    With the \u00a310,000 goal target thoroughly smashed, the campaign has been unlocking stretch goals. You can see the completed stretch goals in the list below!\nInfamy: Welcome to The Big Smoke is a 32mm, character-driven skirmish game that focuses on action-packed turns. \nLiving rulebook - Rather than commit to a printed rulebook straight away, Infamy: Welcome to The Big Smoke will be an evolving online resource that backers can access. \nYou'll get early-access to the latest rules and errata and be able to play the game to your heart's content while it is refined. Should you wish, you'll be able to provide feedback on the rules and stats to improve the game.\nNon-backers will be invited later in the process, during an open beta, before the game is finally locked down and made into a printed tome.\nThe basics - Some of the game's cool features include:\nUp and Down cards - a dynamic, playing card-driven skill system. Each model is dealt an Up and Down card; the closer their total is to 21, the wider the range of skills they can choose from.\nTwist - Loosely based on blackjack, you can gamble to boost the cards' total and thus, your efficiency in combat. However, go over 21 and your abilities rapidly decline.\nDefence - If you need to put all of your model's energy into defence then you can intentionally bust by going over 21. You'll lose attacking ability, but, your defence will drastically increase.\nOpposed dice-offs - to keep you engaged in combat regardless of who it is activating a model.\nThree-tiered defence - each character has body, armour and ward points on their wound track; streamlining the process of making armour saves and recording wounds. \nSplit activations - some characters can split skills over multiple activations during the same turn, allowing them to perform combo moves.\nFreedom - Though you always need a Kingpin to lead the gang, you can then choose anyone to fight side-by-side for a huge range of tactical options.\n\nKingpins - Each gang in Infamy is headed up by a Kingpin - these are the most powerful combatants and skilled leaders in the game. From the cunning and synchronised strategies of Sherlock Holmes, to the brute force of the mechanically powered Toad, or the senile bimbling of Uncle John, each Kingpin is unique and brings a range of options and new challenges.\nPacked with character - Infamy is all about making interesting stories in battle, so there are no faceless grunts. All the models in the game so far have a personality and a defined style. Finding the right mix is vital to success at a higher level of play, but, if you just want to have fun, the very clear traits of each character mean you'll have a great time.\nSpecialisms - Every model in Infamy can be assessed by their specialisms. These are: \nEach specialism is represented by a playing card suit. A model will require both a high card total and a card of the relevant suit to perform their very best skills. This rewards players who perfectly balance their gang to make the best use of all four specialisms.\nIt is the late 19th century and technological revolution is sweeping through Great Britain. Sparked by Mycroft Holmes' creation of the Cogitation Engine, the nation's capital is caught up in a wave of invention and discovery.\nThe city thrums to the sound of gigantic and increasingly-elaborate machines, their maze-like interiors of cogs and pistons churning around the clock. Powered by armies of navvies who shovel fuel into the huge burners and risk their lives performing maintenance, these machines drive the city. They are the lifeblood of London's 'Golden Age' and fill the air with the thick smoke of industry and mass-production.\nThe development of increasingly powerful Cogitation Engines has laid waste to the traditional structure of power in London. Long-established institutions, initially reluctant to take on the 'dangerous' new technology, are on the brink of collapse and now they must battle to retain control.\nWhile they flounder in the wake of change, upstarts rise to power, embracing the new age, creating ever more incredible tools, machinery, intelligence-gathering methods, and weapons.\nThese companies, corporations, institutions, and their members reside in ornate and elaborate towers, rising high above the streets, increasingly isolated from the machinery-filled nightmare evolving beneath them.\nAnd in the city's underbelly the downtrodden, forgotten and abused working-class grow angry. Opportunistic rabble rousers, crime lords, Kingpins, and undesirables gather support in the annexed areas of the city, all hungry for a piece of the pie.\nThe awesome folks at Golem Painting Studio are ready to work their expert brushmanship over your Infamy: Welcome to The Big Smoke pledge should you so desire! If you have questions about any of these painted pledges, please send me a message.\nPledges will be packed and shipped by Element Games - an awesome independent geeky haven, with an online store and brick and mortar shop in Stockport inside the North West Gaming Centre.\nThey have an amazing reputation for getting well-packed deliveries out fast so your pledge will be in safe hands. \nThe cost for UK shipping is included in the pledge costs. International orders are a little extra. Because Element are shipping from the UK there won't be any hidden customs and import costs to the EU.\nInfamy wouldn't have been possible without the amazing creative talent of these artists, sculptors, writers, mini-painters, and designers. Huge thanks to them all!\nHi, I'm James and I run Infamy Miniatures. Over the last couple of years I've been developing the world of Infamy and more recently, getting ready for this Kickstarter.\nSince my first game of Heroquest in 1989 I've been passionate about toy soldiers. Through that passion I ended up working at Games Workshop, then I turned my hand to freelance miniature painting until I eventually made the crazy decision to launch Infamy. Financial destitution has been the result, with every spare penny being thrown towards the range, but I wouldn't have had it any other way. I still love miniatures and games just as much as I did that first day I unwrapped Heroquest! :D\nSome of my favourite games include Necromunda, Malifaux, Dominion, Mordheim and Warhammer Quest. I'm also a big fan of video games, from old-school platformers and beat 'em ups to RTS and JRPGs. Elements from these, as well as many other tabletop games, have inspired the game of Infamy.\nI live in Nottingham (toy soldier central) and am part of a small collective of four mini companies called British Indie. Together we spend way too much time whiling away the hours, plotting the development of our mini ranges!\nI love to cook overly complex, experimental and fancy food; mess about in Photoshop; read trashy sci-fi and fantasy novels and occasionally something 'worthy'; play video games; consume whole HBO series in intense bursts, and hang out with my amazing and supportive girlfriend.\nI am incredibly excited about Infamy and I can't wait for people to get gaming in the world. Thanks so much for taking a look at this campaign. Hopefully I'll catch up with some of you at a show in the future. Maybe we will even have time to get a game in! :)\nCheers,", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nPreparing for this Kickstarter has already been a big commitment - concepts and art have been produced, various miniatures are sculpted and the manufacturing processes for models and other add-ons have been planned. \n\nI have given careful consideration to each part of the process, to minimise risk when the campaign ends and fulfillment begins. \n\nInstead of relying on just concept art to illustrate my products, many of the initial models on offer have already been completed. The rest have sculptors scheduled to begin work on them as soon as the Goal Target has been passed. I also have many more miniatures already sculpted, ready to be added to the campaign should Stretch Goals kick in. So, backers already have a good idea of the quality and style of miniature they are investing in.\n\nI have produced various models in high-quality resin before and will be using the same tried and tested caster for this project. Making amazing resin models is a daily process for him and his team and he is used to manufacturing resin minis at a high volume but in stunning detail.\n\nI work on Infamy full-time and I have enlisted some helpers to answer questions and post updates on the rare occasions that I intend on sleeping! ;) I have also been involved in maintaining the campaign pages for three successful Kickstarters run by friends over the last year. I am very used to running a campaign. \n\nFinally, I have set achievable delivery date estimates. This will increase the likelihood that product will be delivered on time or, perhaps even ahead of schedule.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #126", "update_userinfo": "Infamy Games are hitting the reset button!", "update_content": "Hello everyone, James here, writing an update for first time in quite a while.

A great deal of imagination has been put into each figure and a great deal of time in figuring out how to make a range of great looking unique characters that are in almost all cases single part figures so you can have less time prepping the figure before painting and more time gaming! The figures will be cast in either white metal or resin depending on how you want to receive your reward. \nWith my new line of \"Tooth & Sword\" Chibi adventure miniatures I'm seeking to expand what Meridian Miniatures will have to offer the gaming community. I've had a lot of fun learning to sculpt in this style, it providing a perfect counterpoint to my \"Steam & Aether\" range in both technique and mood. I've have a great deal of enjoyment developing this menagerie of adventuring animals and now the time has come to unleash them. I've sought to cover a fairly wide spectrum of adventuring classes and animal species, something that proved quite challenging when I came to combining the two factors! The first eight figures that I'd like to make available are very loosely grouped as \"lawful\" and well, less than lawful but they needn't be played that way by RPGers or wargamers! \nImportant, these \"neutral\" figures are now unlocked and can be pledged for ONLY by choosing the relevant metal or resin pledge level. As individual figures they are available a in resin as usual.\nThese fun looking figures should inspire imaginative players to create their own player characters and fantasy skirmishers alike. With several companies now producing figures in the Chibi style I feel that players have the opportunity to create their own immersive game play with a wide range of figures. With this in mind I've set out to bring my own unique animal adventurers to life, they can easily slot into place in your favourite fantasy world and will become part of my own \"Tooth & Sword\" players resource setting. I've come to Kickstarter as I've built up quite a range of characters to produce and need to raise funds to cover the moulding costs, artwork and game resource development. With your funding I can get the figures into production and onto your tabletop quickly and in one wave rather than in dribs and drabs over a year or more. Should the figures prove highly successful I'll be able to produce even more goodies to say thanks to you all. \nHow it works.\nThe miniatures have been grouped into two sets for casting in white metal: \"the good guys\" and \"the wicked ones\" these sets are the most affordable way to receive your reward and the most cost effective way for me to produce the figures. The moulding and casting of these white metal sets is being handled by Griffin Moulds Ltd, some of the very best mould makers in the UK. You can choose to receive one or two sets at the applicable reward level. For those of you that only want a specific figure or want to mix and match I am offering high quality resin figures as an alternate reward, simply select single figure reward level and set your pledge at a multiple of the level depending on how many individual figures you want. You can even add additional figures to your metal sets by adding to your pledge level\nStretch goals.\nOnce we reach \u00a33500 I will be giving EVERY BACKER a set of free stickers to say thank you, this is enough on top of the goal to realistically to cover the printing costs, if there's chance I will add more stickers as the campaign goes on.\nFREE STICKERS AT \u00a33500\nI'm planning on making art prints and more to give as freebies too but all will depend on backer support, more details will come as the campaign progresses. If the demand is there I will sculpt a timed exclusive figure to add as a stretch goal, this can be discussed as the campaign goes on. \nAdd ons.\nI will be making the various art prints and post card available as add ons during the campaign as well, so long as all goes well. To add anything extra to your pledge just adjust it by the appropriate amount. I will find out exactly what you pledged for when I send out the surveys after the campaign finishes. \nNew add-ons!\nAdd on the resin Hippogryph model for \u00a312 per figure. Picture shows work in progress, check back for updates.\n I am offering these pieces of artwork as high quality A3 prints to anyone that would like to add them on to their pledge, this isn't something that I'm really going to be making profit on, as the postage costs are unfortunately high but I can't not offer them as I'm so happy with the artwork and I'm sure a few of you are going to really enjoy having them up on the wall of your gaming room! If you would like an A3 art print and you are in the UK then just add on \u00a310 for EACH print (lion/mouse or wolf/bat) that you would like. If you are in the rest of the world then please add \u00a314 for EACH print that you would like. These will ship separately to the rest of your pledge and the rates for international postage are especially high for postal tubes\nCHARACTER POSTCARDS IN PROGRESS.\nThe future.\nI've got an extensive range of figures planned along with a whole setting  to explore, I've no current plans to release a game system but will be making all sorts of gaming resources available for free.

NO PROBLEM PLEDGING FROM OUTSIDE THE UK!  KICKSTARTER ACCEPTS ALL CURRENCIES!! \nOFFICIAL DHMIS T SHIRT DESIGN  #1 REVEALED!!!\n(For more info on the other 2 DHMIS t-shirts check the latest update in the update section above)\n******NEW REWARD*******\n\u00a315! Digital Downloads of all episodes, the DHMIS album, in the Fanclub PLUS you get the Official A2 poster-and if you like we'll sign it!!\nWHY BOTHER?\nImagine a show that can teach you ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT EVERYTHING in short musical installments. That show is Don't Hug Me I'm Scared.\nSo far we have covered two of life's most important lessons in these videos, but surely this can't be the end for the puppets? Can it? CAN IT?\nWe've been blown away by the response to the first 2 episodes, not just the amount of views that the videos have had or the festivals they have played at around the world, but also the amount of fans that DHMIS has accumulated. \nIt's totally spurred us on to make this show into a full series and we think doing it independently through Kickstarter, funded by the fans, is the way to go. \nRight now we are both very excited about the new ideas we have for more episodes, made directly for the WIDE WEB, and continuing to teach all the answers to life's most puzzling questions\u2026.\nWhere do dogs live? \nWhy are we here, and what is the purpose of Life?\nWhy do I constantly hear the sound of crabs screaming in my head?\nWhy is this pillowcase full of ham?\nDON'T WORRY!!! All questions will be answered in Time.\n4 NEW EPISODES!\nLike Creativity and Time, in the following 4 episodes we want to introduce 4 NEW characters that will guide the friends through 4 new important subjects. \nAlthough we can't reveal what the topics will be right now, we can say that eventually the puppets will understand everything and all will be revealed\u2026\u2026\nBUT WHY KICKSTARTER??????????????\nThe first two episodes were essentially self-funded projects, made with the help of lots of talented people who worked for free and something we were only able to work on between other jobs \u2013 hence why it takes years between each episode.\nContinuing to make the show this way without a proper budget means it could take many years to complete and we'll all be dead by the time episode 3 comes out. \nIS THAT WHAT YOU WANT? FOR US TO DIE?? MAKING A PUPPET SHOW???\nBUT, if successful, not only will we be able to commit to DHMIS full time but we will be able to really push each episode, making the show a BIGGER and more in-depth journey into the world of DHMIS!\nAnd the best thing is we won't have to compromise or change our ideas, we can keep in all the rotten pig heart cakes and dead fish because we want to have rotten pig heart cakes and dead fish!\n  \u00a324,000 per episode seems like a lot of money, but making a show that mixes live action, stop motion, 2d animation and puppetry tends to be a bit pricey. However, we believe that the final outcome is well worth it. \nHere's a very brief summary of where the money will go on each episode.\nPre-production: Writing, storyboarding, creating an animatic, characters and concept designs.\nAudio: writing and recording the music, all the voices and sound design.\nProduction: Building all the sets, puppets, props, models and the cost of all materials.\nShooting: Studio time, location costs, crew, lights, camera and lots and lots of stress.\nPost production: editing, compositing, adding 2d or CG animation and lots more dull digital work.\nTHE REWARDS\nMaking this show is something we have been excited about for a long time, so if we are fortunate enough to reach our goal, we want to say thanks with some special DHMIS rewards.\n( PLEASE NOTE: PLEDGING FROM THE USA, OR OTHER INTERNATIONAL PLACES IS NOT A PROBLEM AND WILL BE CONVERTED TO BRITISH POUNDS )\nFor just \u00a35 you will be able to download each episode as soon as they come out, DRM-Free!\n\u00a38 will get you downloads to all episodes as they come out, plus the DHMIS album with all songs, karaoke versions and a few extra tracks.\n\u00a315: You'll get the downloads to all episodes and the DHMIS album plus become part of the OFFICIAL DHMIS FANDOM.

Players will code their way through a fantasy world full of rival sorcerers and their minions.  It will be available for PC, Mac, iPad and Android Tablets.\nThe goal of the game is to be as broad and inclusive as possible.  A gender-neutral fantasy setting, a female protagonist, a narrative backbone, and a language designed for accessibility; these are all ways to knock down barriers that prevent some kids from engaging with programming.  When everybody is making technology, the technology they make will be for everybody.\n'Codemancer' features a moving story about a girl trying to grow up and do good despite incredible obstacles.  Aurora's Father's life is in her hands, and that's a lot of pressure for a child just learning to be independent.\nACHIEVED! If the project reaches $20,000: Level Editor \nI am making one of these for myself, so that the process of creating levels can be faster, but I'd like to make it a public-facing feature of the game, so that anyone can make their own Codemancer level.\nACHIEVED! If the project reaches $30,000: Python for Codemancers\nI will put up a Udemy-style online course called 'Python for Codemancers,' and make it free for all backers. This course will transfer the skills you learn playing Codemancer to a real-world programming language.\nACHIEVED! WHAT? If we reach $40,000: Codemancer: The Novel\nI will collaborate with another author to create a companion young-adult novel set in the world of Codemancer. The novel will be free to all backers, will include spells that may be useful in the game, and will expand on the Codemancer lore.\nPlayers will position magical runes which represent commands.  Some are direct commands, like 'move forward.' Others are what's called \"flow control\" which determines how the spells execute.  Arranging the runes in the correct order allows the player to move in any desired pattern and respond to unforeseen events.\nGameplay takes place in a hexagonal world, so it's easy to estimate distances and angles by eye. 'Forward 1' moves Aurora's familiar into the next hexagon. 'Right 1' turns the familiar in place, causing it to face the next edge (clockwise) of the hexagon.\nFor example, here is a simple spell (or program) you might use in the game, along with some real-world programs for comparison on the right:\nwhich causes your Familiar to move like this:\nAs you can see, Codemancer's language is designed to be accessible, but also translates easily to a variety of popular real-world programming languages.  More complex programs are made when we introduce programming concepts like Variables, Conditionals, and Functions.\nThere's also a 'freeze time' ability, so players can debug the programs they've written and potentially code their way out of a jam.  If they can't, and Aurora's hearts run out, the level restarts very quickly -- a lesson that the stakes are reasonably low, and it never hurts to try things out.\nOur goal is to cover all the same material you would cover in a typical Programming 101 course at University.\nAurora lives in a world where a pact between humanity and nature allows a few select individuals to command creatures of nature using spells composed of runes.  This starts with the choosing of an animal familiar.  Familiars are animal companions that accompany a person throughout his or her life.  They are also subject to the commands of the rune language.\nJust as Aurora is learning a bit about how to command her familiar, her Father is kidnapped by an Evil Sorcerer, whose minions are commanded by the same runic spells.  Aurora gives chase, attempting to defeat the minions and reclaim her Father.  That is where her adventure begins.\nAs she journeys Northward, in pursuit of her Father's captors, Aurora meets several friendly wizards who continue to teach her about spellcasting, because acquiring this skill can mean the difference between life and death.\nAurora Li \nAurora begins our story as a creative but entitled little girl, but grows into a talented and gracious young woman over the course of the story.  She is our protagonist.\nArthur Li (Dad)\nArthur is a supportive single Dad.  Arthur moved himself and his daughter Aurora out to the country so that they could be close to the best introductory wizarding school in the world: Lovelace Academy. Arthur is abducted on Aurora's first day of school, which is the beginning of her adventure.\nMs. Lovelace\nA little stern, but very compassionate.  Ms. Lovelace runs Lovelace Academy for Young Wizards.\nYour Familiar\n In the beginning of the game, you must choose an animal familiar, who will live and grow with you over the course of the game.\nEvil Sorcerer\nThe identity of the Evil Sorcerer is unknown, but we do know that he or she has the ability to create powerful constructs from any object at hand.\nThe narrative is inspired by popular works of young adult fantasy - Harry Potter, Mistborn, The Golden Compass, The Neverending Story, The Wizard of Earthsea, The Last Airbender and many more.  These stories have captured the minds of several generations of young children.  A good story can move millions to pick up a book, and I think it can move millions more to start programming.\nI\u2019ve been working on Codemancer for the past year, while doing contracting work to support development costs. We\u2019ve assembled our team, developed a great workflow, and playtest on a regular basis to find possible improvements. The main mechanics of the game have been hammered out.  We mostly need to focus on content creation -- making levels, enemies, cutscenes and a few additional features.\nA few enemy concept sketches\nIt sounds simple, but this is when the real magic happens, when a toy becomes a game.  The devil's in the details, and we aim to smoke him out. \nWe are already sending out regular updates to our supporters - and can assure you this will only continue with our Kickstarter backers.  You can check out previous updates here.\nI've been paying for the production costs out of pocket so far, but with your help we can make the game so much more.  Here's a breakdown of how the Kickstarter money will be spent if we're successful:\nRob Lockhart (aka bobbylox)\nI'm the game designer and programmer on this project.  I've been in games for about four years, the last of which was spent founding Important Little Games.  My time is split between creating learning games for clients and building Codemancer.\nPatrick Beavers (aka Arfenhaus)*\nPatrick is the character designer and animator of Codemancer.  He also does a lot of work in comic books.\nPui Che (aka Pui Che)*\nPui is the illustrator behind the environments and all the inanimate objects in the game.\nDavid Novak (aka R2Dave2)*\nDave is a brilliant composer and a good friend.  He'll be doing all the music for the game (he composed the amazing music for the Kickstarter Video above).\n*these folks are not working for free", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIn terms of development, I can assure you that the worst is over. I've planned for every scenario I could think of in terms of the continued progress and completion of the game. I've scoped the game tightly, so I will be completing this game even if the Kickstarter fails, though it would take a lot longer. I also enjoy the fellowship and support of the Chicago Indie community, especially all the amazing folks who co-work with me at the Indie City Coop, who have already advised me so much in designing and developing the game.\n\nThat said, every software project has bumps in the road. It's very possible that my estimated delivery time could be too optimistic, either because of technology problems, or because the team can't keep the right creative pace. There may be personnel changes which add time, or other unforeseeable disasters.\n\nThese are obstacles which we would all have to face together, dear backers. However, this I promise: I will tell you whenever we encounter problems, and whenever we solve them. I will be as open and transparent as I'm able. In fact I may overshare, and you can tell me if that becomes a problem, too.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #58", "update_userinfo": "You're Helping the World, a Little", "update_content": "Hello, True Believers!\nThese are trying times, and things can feel a bit hopeless, but I wanted to let you know that by backing Codemancer, you've helped the world, a little.

I've been working on the world and the game for well over a decade and since 2009 I have written and published the first two books in the series, released a wide range of finely sculpted miniatures and built a community of enthusiastic gamers, world builders and painters.\nThe project has been going amazingly well so far, funding within 3 hours and the enthusiasm of our backers has opened up lots of options for me to be able to produce! There are now lots of new starter forces available (details below), some bonus critters and models. We've unlocked a special Compilation edition of the first three book, which is now going to come with a limited edition map of Anyaral.

It is now almost complete and this is your opportunity to help me get it into production (as well as getting some fun toys in the process)! If you have already tried World of Twilight then this is a great way to round off your collection with the new book, PLUS a limited resin edition model of Gil Masharl, Travelling Biologist, with his lizardy pet on his shoulder and an interesting hat.\nThanks to great support we managed to smash the funding target in less than three hours! That means its Stretch Goals from here on in... good thing I have lots that I would like to do!\nThe Knights of Orelan Miniatures, part of the Fubarnii Empire\nIf you're new to World of Twilight and like our stuff, but are a bit bemused and asking questions like, \"Are there any vampires?\" * then don't worry - I've included a couple of pledge levels to help you get started, either just getting hold of all the books and components to try the game or jumping straight in with a starter force for all three cultures. \nYou can also find out much more on our www.worldoftwilight.com, particularly on our forum.\n* No, there are no vampires.\nOver the last year I have been slaving away on Travels through Anyaral, the third book set in the World of Twilight. It has proved to be a larger task than originally planned as the range has grown substantially since 'Of Gods and Demons' was published three years ago and there was so much I wanted to squeeze in! This book has ended up with many more densely populated pages and rules for more figures than both the first two books put together.\nI am now proud to present Travels through Anyaral, a 52 page full colour paperback A5 rulebook that tells the story of Danakan, a reluctant Fubarnii who has the dubious pleasure of travelling across the continent of Anyaral. The book follows his journey from the provincial coasts of his homelands, through the dangerous Argoran Wastes to the mighty city of Gar Loren. From there Danakan travels into the icy realms of the secretive Delgon before he braves the sea to sail home aboard an Enguan ship. The book uses the story of Danakan's travels to introduce exciting new rules for bringing themed forces from across these lands to your games of Twilight, as well as giving a view of the varied history of these lands. In addition to the new rules, there are several scenarios to add new twists and variety to your games. \nDevanu Outcasts Miniatures, part of the Devanu Culture\nI am now combining Book 3 and the first two books into a single Compilation edition, which I am very excited about! You can either add the compilation book to your pledge, or you get a free upgrade for all pledges of Sempa or above. We've also got lots of fancy new accessories that I am going to be able to get into production. Thank you!\nI have spent many years developing the rules for Twilight and spent countless hours trying out different mechanics and rules systems until I arrived at a set of rules I was happy with. In 2009 I released the basic rules and I have thoroughly enjoyed hearing people playing the game since!\nThe rules allow you to play skirmish scale games with a handful of models in less than an hour, but you can also scale up to larger battles if you've got an entire evening to spare.\nTurn order is controlled by drawing initiative counters from a bag, and it becomes important to have the right command structures in place to make the most of when you have a chance to activate your troops.\nCombat is determined using special combat stones. Both sides secretly select what balance of aggressive or defensive stones they wish to use, then cast simultaneously to see what happens. This leads to plenty of difficult decisions and tension as you try to guess your opponent's tactics!\nIf you are interested in seeing more details of the rules then you can download the first two rulebooks for free from http://www.worldoftwilight.com/Rules.html.\nThis is where you come in, with your help I can finally get Travels through Anyaral into print!\nI have also sculpted a new Fubarnii exclusively for this Kickstarter Campaign. I will be getting him cast in high quality resin and this version of Gil will only be available for this campaign, although I might get a small number of extras cast for specials at shows.\nThere are various pledge levels available as rewards during this campaign, ranging from the Curious Hatchling, which will let you just get hold of Gil Masharl, right up to the Aggressive Kopa, which is an ideal entry point if you are completely new to the World of Twilight and want to try out the various forces, or just want to expand your collection with the new themed forces. All the pledges let you get add-ons as well, which for the moment will just let you choose to add one or more starter forces to your pledge. \nThe Egg is the entry level pledge if you just want to support the campaign and see the updates.  \nThe Curious Hatchling is the easiest way to get hold of the exclusive kickstarter figure, cast in high quality resin.\nThe Academic Jenta pledge level is the perfect way to get hold of Travels through Anyaral and comes with the Kickstarter special model, Gil. I'm also going to expand the book slightly to include rules for Gil so you can use him in your games.\nThe Enthusiastic Sempa gives you an opportunity to pick up all three books and all the dice and stones needed for the game. It is also an great point for adding one or two Starter Forces.\nThe Aggressive Kopa pledge is an ideal starter point if you want to dive right in and try out all three of the Twilight cultures, or if you've been playing a while and would like to try out some new themed forces! I'm planning to create new moulds so I can release these three forces and this is an ideal opportunity for me to add variants of a few of the figures at the same time! You can expect to see a few minor changes to the figure line-up over the course of the campaign, starting with the ghostly figures in the above graphic. \nThe Delgon force is part of the inventor-priest NurSen Plutom's personal bodyguard. As well as his two KalDreman Bodyguards, the force includes a mechanically legged KalMalog, a flamethrower wielding KalGush and a KalDru with an explosive derak. There is also a small unit of KalJoran Shocktroopers led by a NuraKira priest.\nThe Devanu are represented by an outcast force of young jenta. These are led by an older Outcast, with three of his followers and three grishak hunting beasts.\nThe Empire are a force of Orelan Knights, with a Captain and two knights accompanied by a unit of militia including a captain on hoof (Fubarnii have hooves rather than feet), four militia and three little graku.\nThe Mighty Emperor is the option for the collector who wants everything! At this level you get any 8 forces (you can swap Starter forces out for 2 Expansion Forces) as well as everything from the Sempa level plus a bonus copy of Gil and lots of stretch goal items. \nThere should also be special Initiative Stones suitable for an Emperor (if I can get an effect I'm happy with!). I've also reset the postage down to \u00a310, giving an even better saving for international orders.\nYou can add the following Starter Forces, Expansion Forces and Accessories to any pledge of Curious Hatchling or higher. \nI know how confusing it can be to plan your pledge, so here's a quick summary to try and make it easier!\nStep 1: Choose your pledge level \nHatchling (\u00a310) \u2013 a single copy of Gil with a special stat card. You can add any add-ons you like for all pledges at this level or above. You also get three random critters and a postcard\nJenta (\u00a316) \u2013 A copy of Gil, stat card, three critters, a copy of Travels Through Anyaral (Twilight book 3), a postcard and an Abilities reference card \nSempa (\u00a330) \u2013 Compilation book (with map), Gil, stat card, three critters, an Abilities reference card, a postcard and a starter kit. The stones in all the starter kits have been upgraded to resin stones \nKopa (\u00a3110) \u2013 Everything from Sempa, plus three fixed starter forces (Plutoms Mechanicals, Knights of Orelan and Jenta Outcasts) \nMighty Emperor (\u00a3250) \u2013 Everything from Kopa, but the three fixed starter forces are replaced by any eight starter forces (each starter force can be swapped for two expansion forces) \nStep 2: Choose any add-ons\nThese can be added to any pledges of Hatchling level or above. Simply increase your pledge amount to cover the cost plus postage and there will be a questionnaire at the end for you to fill in the details: \nStarter Forces (\u00a330) \nExpansion Forces (\u00a316 each or two for \u00a330) \nCompilation Book (\u00a315) \u2013 an additional copy of the rulebook which includes the map \nTravels Through Anyaral (\u00a38) \u2013 an additional copy of the third book. Most of the contents will be in the Compilation, but something for the collector! \nReference Cards (\u00a310) \u2013 a deck of stat cards for every unit detailed in the Compilation Book (approx. 72 cards) \nStarter Kit (\u00a310) \u2013 Everything you need to be able to play the game (Metal combat stones, Resin initiative stones, 2 dice and a bag to keep them in) \nResin initiative counters (\u00a33) \u2013 6 coloured initiative counters. If you get multiple sets they will all be different colours so you can have big multiplayer games \nResin Initiative Combat counters (\u00a31) \u2013 2 orange/red initiative counters for marking Combat Phases \nAccessories Set (\u00a310) \u2013 3 different themed sets of 12 resin combat stones plus a laser cut blast template \nFrenu Playtest Kit (\u00a345) (counts as 1.5 Starter forces if used in the Emperor pledge) \u2013 this is a special add-on for people who want to help with the game development, or just want to get some new models really early in the process! Will probably be delivered later than the main pledges. \nDehran Playtest Kit (\u00a330) (counts as a Starter force) \u2013 Resin cast of the Enarii, Dehran. Comes with full playtest details and a playtest card for him. Will probably be delivered later than the main pledges. \nIndividual figures - NuraKira Obal (\u00a34), Danakan and Muri (\u00a39) \nPreePree (\u00a34) \u2013 you can buy a maximum of one additional PreePree for each \u00a3100 or part in your pledge (ie you can buy 1 for any pledge, 2 if you pledge between \u00a3100 and \u00a3200 etc) \nStep 3: Add on Postage \nIf you aren\u2019t based in the UK then there are additional postage charges for all the pledges, starter and expansion forces and some of the add-ons. These are capped at \u00a310 for European orders and \u00a320 for the Rest of the World. The pledge level p&p will add automatically, but you will have to add any additional charges manually. \nStep 4: Confirm Details \nAt some point after the Campaign is over I will send out a pledge survey for everybody. It should be possible to top up your pledge with Paypal or similar if you missed anything or made any mistakes. \nHershaddow has kindly created a pledge calculator which you can find here:\nworldoftwilight.com/PledgeCalculator.xls\nFree Stuff! \nThere is bonus free stuff depending on the amount of money you have pledged, including any postage. These will automatically be added to your pledge: \n\u00a350 or more - a small pile of scientific equipment for Gil (bottles, book, telescope and a big mushroom). (2 piles of equipment if you pledged at Emperor level) \n\u00a3100 or more - if the total reaches \u00a320k then you will get a free Engineer Beru with your pledge \n\u00a3150 or more \u2013 a free copy of Danakan and Muri \n\u00a3200 or more \u2013 a free PreePree (doesn\u2019t count towards the PreePree order limit) \nStep 5: Wait for everything to arrive! \nI will aim to get everything sent out before the end of July, except for the Frenu starter kit which may take longer. I will also keep you up to date on progress over the next few months! \nChampions of Anyaral \nDuring the campaign I announced that I would be rewarding certain people the title of 'Champion of Anyaral'. Anybody who has pledged \u00a3250 or more will automatically get the title. They will be mentioned in the book and will get a special very limited edition 'Baby Gil' miniature.\nHere is a final summary of all the starter and expansion forces available.

Our Drifter is haunted by an insatiable illness, traveling further into the lands of Buried Time, steeped in blood and treasure hoping to discover a way to quiet the vicious disease. Echoes of a dark and violent past from the dead eras resonate throughout and he can't help but listen.\nHyper Light Drifter is a 2D Action RPG in the vein of the best 8-bit and 16-bit classics, with modernized mechanics and designs on a much grander scale.\nVisions for this game have been fluttering in my skull for ages; something dark and fantastic, with giant forests to navigate, huge floating structures to explore, deep crumbling ruins to loot, massive throngs of enemies to rend, and behemoths both flesh and mechanical to overcome. I want it all to be as beautiful as possible, forging color with the dark and eerie wastes and intimidating landscapes. It plays like the best parts of A Link to the Past and Diablo, evolved: lightning fast combat, more mobility, an array of tactical options, more numerous and intelligent enemies, and a larger world with a twisted past to do it all in.\nRip through enemies with responsive, fun combat; engaging and brutal. Upgrade weapons, discover new equipment and trek deeper than ever.\nTraverse a dark, detailed and interconnected world with alternate paths and secret loot. Miyazaki films have taught me that beautiful animation and design add life to a world. From characters to background elements, everything is lovingly crafted while I hum show-tunes and squint suspiciously at the flickering pixels until they perform as intended.\nA challenge - The game is accessible and easy to pick up, but difficult to master and complete; enemies and hazards become more vicious and numerous, so players must use clever tactics to avoid death. (Some yell hurtful phrases at players simply to bring tears to the cereal bowl below.)\n  Core Mechanics\nPrimary weapon - Composed of phase shifted Hard Light (also known as Solid Light), your sword acts as the primary means of offense; it's quick, brutal, and can slash through most anything. Best of all it never runs low on energy.\nSprite Companion - An indispensable personalized drone, the Sprite manages your inventory virtually, maintains your shields, seeks out hidden paths and lights the way in the darkest of times. Functionality may be expanded with new modules.\nSecondary items - You'll come across a variety of advanced weaponry, items and gear throughout your travels; Light Rail Pistols, Heavy Rifles, various hi-power explosives and enemy-aware Seeker Drones. All of these are powered by limited batteries, found scattered throughout the world. \nDefense System - A rechargeable Hard Light Diamond shield which offers total protection from attacks for a short burst of time. If timed correctly projectiles can be reflected back at enemies for extra damage. Can be upgraded to extend duration.\nDash Module - Multi-use gear that enables a triple speed dash; can be used to evade attacks, cut across gaps and chasms, break through certain blocks and rubble and even stun enemies.\nRifle\nRoly Poly\nFrom Sean Ward\nEnemy Sprites\nFrom Nick Wozniak\nFrom Ian Schlaepfer\nBoss Reveals\n#1\nSprite work: Johan Vinet\nName: Rivan The Tamer\nAttributes: User of searing RedShift light, causing great destruction when attacking. His companion beast adds to his already fierce tactics.\nDomain: The Deep Red Keep, roaming the Barren Halls.\n#2\nMusic Reveal\nFrom the Masterful Disasterpeace (Rich Vreeland) here's the first sample track:\nNotes on $160,000 Goal:\nI want this game to shine. I want to fully indulge this vision, so I will use the funds to further the quality of the game rather than bolster any after-thoughts.\nOn $180,000 Goal:\nThere are so many great artists, illustrators, writers, wonderfully creative people that I'm surrounded by and I want them in on this! I plan to commission small pieces of art to flesh out the world; they can create new character that live in this world, write new lore, and punch out some rad art, all within the limitations of the history and style of this world. All work will be collected in the Companion Art Book and their pieces featured on our site once they start producing!\nOn $200,000 Goal:\nThe Companion Art Book is a physical compendium of knowledge and reference materials, high res unused art assets and never before seen art works for the project. It will also include commissioned pieces and extended lore for the world and characters within created by several artists throughout the community as well as a collection of some of the fan art that has been and continues to be posted. (Love it all!) this will be available for purchase after the campaign has ended, once everything has been commissioned and compiled. \nNotes on PS4 + Vita + Wii U + OUYA support\nREVISION! I'd like for everyone to be able to get the version they want. If you have already contributed at the $10 tier, simply pledge an additional $5 and I'll compose a survey after the campaign is over to determine which version you would like a key for. Cross-buy is undetermined for right now. If you have already contributed at $15 or more, you will be given the choice of PC, Linux, Mac, PS4, Vita, Wii U, or OUYA. That's as simple as I can make it for now!\nDetails on the Challenge Mode\nThis mode will have several mix-up mini quests for you to test your skills at; you'll have wave-based challenges where you fight off increasingly difficult hordes to see how long you can survive as you level up, boss rush runs, speed runs and other odd modes that wouldn't typically fit in the main game. All will have a scoring mechanism that unlocks achievements, plus we are working on local co-op for this mode.\nPhysical Box and Manual\nWe will be able to provide and ship out a slick designed SNES style physical box and manual to go with your digital download! Both printed in full color and shipped directly to you. This is NOW a Reward Tier AND you can get it as an add-on for any Tier if you add $35 to your pledge! The Stretch Goal allows us to offer it outside of the Kickstarter for any who would like to nab it down the line.\nThe game is in a prototype phase, planned initially for PC, though I would love to expand to other platforms. \nHaving worked with Beau Blyth of Samurai Gunn fame on the programming side, the framework for the game is in place - remaining mechanics and the body of the game will slot nicely into current systems. All will be refined until it feels sleek, satisfying and fun. \nThe venerable and talented Disasterpeace (Rich Vreeland) has been gracious enough to jump on board to compose the soundtrack!\nThe bigger task ahead is asset generation; enemy sprites (which use dozens of frames of hand drawn art, including the major Boss encounters), new level designs (plus fancy lighting!), and sound design.\nIf I reach the $64,000 stretch goal, I will be able to hire a secondary animator/designer which will allow more time to sink into expanding the world.\nThe $75,000 goal will allow for an even deeper soundtrack with bonus tracks plus a SFX pro.\nI have planned for a potential release date in mid 2014, with beta access at least two months prior, allowing time to tweak and bug-fix and adjust according to player feedback. A more solid schedule will become apparent for backers once resources have been assessed.\nThis project has rapidly evolved into a much larger world and story and needs the help of the community in order for it to thrive.\nCompleting this game by mid 2014 requires focus and time; the initial goal will afford me these two (current) luxuries.The higher stretch goals will allow a fully realized version.\nPaying outside help - This is a passion project for me, but other friends and professionals (such as Beau and Rich) need to be compensated for their tremendous talents. Having a sound effects producer/musical talent as well as an animator to assist would lighten the workload considerably and allow me to concentrate on the overall structure and scope of the game, as well as fine tuning all of the time consuming little things.\nCompany and operation costs - In order to begin selling through any platform I'll need to establish Heart Machine as a full game company, which takes a fair chunk of money and time, plus licensing, living costs and bills factor in.\nImproving and fixing - Getting testers, implementing community feedback, using every ounce of my soul to produce a game I've been dreaming of for decades.\nAccess to the Game \nI have been researching distribution methods. Now I have PC, Mac, Linux (DRM-Free or Steam), PS4, Vita, Wii U, and OUYA.\nThe closed Beta will surely hold some valuable insight, and in order to implement that knowledge delays may happen. I will do my best to keep Backers informed of progress on all fronts.\n  Concepts\nAlex Preston (Heart Machine) -alxpreston.com, @HeartMachineZ\nLead Designer + Animator + Secondary Programming\nI've been an illustrator and designer for a good long while now. Developing games has been a passion of mine since I was a child, though I've never had the courage and support until now to actually release something into the wild. Spread your neon wings you sweet pixelated bastard!\nBeau Blyth (Teknopants) -teknopants.com, @Teknopants\nLead Programmer + Tremendous Hair\nDeveloped loads of rad fast-paced arcade style games including the upcoming super bad-ass Samurai Gunn. A master of many disciplines and the man helping me code this beastly project. A massive thanks and unending high fives/hugs/punches go his way. Also payment.\nRich Vreeland (Disasterpeace) - disasterpeace.com/, @Disasterpeace\nMusical Score + Piercing Eyes\nThis chip-blasting machine of a man has produced tons of fantastic game albums, most notably Fez. (Which completely wrecked my mind for a solid year.) I've been lucky enough to get him aboard on this project to develop the soundtrack; you know he'll deliver something special.\nWill Wiesenfeld (Baths)- bathsmusic.com, @BATHSmusic\nContributor + Super Fantastic Beat-dropper\nA supreme talent and fine craftsman of music and smiles, also known as the one-man pound-storm of deep beats and carnal wailing that is Baths, has produced the trailer track. Is producing another track for the game during production.\nTeddy Diefenbach (TeddyDief) -teddydiefenbach.com, @TeddyDief\nA thoughtful soul who created The Moonlighters and Shove Pro, co-founded Rad Dragon, is a programmer and game designer extraordinaire. Dives deep into things such as systems design, narrative design and his ultimate mission of recreating the golden age of late 90s Squaresoft.\nThe Game\nAll copies will be sent out upon release 2014. Planned platforms are Windows, Linux and Mac OSX and now PS4, Vita, Wii U, and OUYA. PC copies can be DRM-free or Steam keys (thanks to our backers pushing us through Greenlight!). Everyone in the $10 tier will get the PC/Mac/Linux game on release, $15 and above will net you an option for PS4, Vita, Wii U, or OUYA, and the $25 tier receives a Kickstarter exclusive version of the game with bonus side quest.\nInstruction Booklet\nA nifty little booklet to bring you back to the days when manuals meant something; revealing a little known move, a secret passage, or simply bolstering the story and context of the world outside of the game. This particular Instruction Book will include all of those items and more, with illustrations to accompany important sections.\nCompanion Book (Art and Stories)\nThis beauty will contain tons of concept illustrations, sprites, sketches, notes on characters and the world, plus revealing knowledge of the finer details of this realm. This process has already generated a lot of assets that won't be used in game, so I'd like to provide a look behind-the-scenes of a project like this. Plus silly drawings of cat creatures and Pork-Peoples will be stuffed into the pages for pure entertainment purposes. Much mocking of lowly creatures shall be had!\nOriginal Soundtrack\nThe master Rich Vreeland (Disasterpeace) will be composing the eerie OST for this game! I'm jazz-handin' all around this room with excitement at this very moment, nearly unable to continue typing! The full OST will be included in digital form at the $40 Tier with bonus tracks. Boom!\nAlternate Drifter\nReceive a Kickstarter-only alternative main playable character to destroy and explore with. He might have a variant weapon, glowing eyes, and sinister intentions.\nResplendent Print\nA 18x24 archival quality print of the main character posing in a fantastic manner (probably with creature parts flying about) will be yours to man-handle or gently place in a frame. Hand signed and numbered, with a lovely thank you note on the rear to haunt you in your sleep.\nImmortal sprite\nYour name will be translated to the in-game rune system, thus immortalizing your very being into this world beyond. These symbols will be used in special locations. Real names only, please. (No, Crack McButtson is not a real name.)\nDesign a dastardly enemy\nPut your skills to use and help design the look, behavior, name and location a new enemy will appear. This is no fools errand; you'll be creating (digital) life itself, and thus comes the responsibility to nurture the sad heap until it's of age to brutalize Drifters every moment it can.\nDesign a mid-boss creature\nHave you always wanted an angry spider to lob shells at you?

That was the biggest hurdle to overcome. The second was exposing this to the public eye, as that can be a terrifying prospect; and here it is.\n\nCreative endeavors like this are difficult and often unwieldy beasts with many mouths to feed and razor-tipped claws to bind. I've written and planned as much as I possibly could up to this point, and with the framework in place I have the bulk of the more difficult obstacles conquered. Issues will come, as they always do in any long-term project, but I feel thoroughly prepared; I have the proper tools and skills and a large support network through our shared community space Glitch City which is bursting at the seams with excellent developers with vast wells of knowledge and years of experience prototyping, building, and releasing games. I feel incredibly lucky to be tapped into this community and to have such reliable friends willing to lend a hand with resources I may need in the future to complete this game.\n \nI've done what I can to get this far through some rather extreme health struggles, and I don't plan to stop. Heart and soul have been etched into this project and I hope it shines through.

To calculate an RRP on Promo Credits their price has been averaged to \u00a35 each. The Arcanite Tokens estimated at \u00a32 for the set.\nThere are now six warbands available (thanks to two being unlocked through Stretch Goals). The warband box-outs for each race show the standard contents. You can choose these as the warbands in your pledge, or, pay an additional \u00a325 to buy it as an add-on.\nThese images also show all of the relevant add-ons for each race. If you would like any of these miniatures, add their cost to your contribution. We will send a survey after the campaign finishes and you can let us know what are your desired extras.\nThe Albionnican Empire is the greatest power on ArcWorlde, her influence and armies spread across the continents. The Empire and her territories are constantly under threat from marauding warbands and hideous monsters. Her men can be seen marching into battle in every corner of the globe.\nPast the Bayourk tribes of the Cayjon Swamplands, in the sweltering jungles of Chaq-Itza, lurk the Jungle Gremlins. Cunning and ferocious, they dwell in vast tribes, using superior numbers when hunting to bring down even the mightiest of creatures. Jungle Gremlins will eat just about anything, and wear the skulls and hides of their prey with pride.\nThe Halflings of Hobbleshire are sturdy folk, whose militia valiantly defend their borders against rampaging hordes of foul beasts. They are as strong as men, tough as old oak, and are more than capable of fighting off anything that dares to raid their lands!\n\nThe Bayourks are huge, hulking monsters who hail from the deepest and darkest swamps of ArcWorlde. Their tribes range far and wide looking for loot. They are the scourge of the outlying settlements of the civilised countries.\nThe Undead Pirates of the Black Coast are the re-animated corpses of those villainous men who have died at sea. Carrying on in death much as they did in life, they raid and pillage both ships and the mainland of ArcWorlde.\nOn the mysterious isle of Cal\u00e9don, a land shrouded in mist off the coast of Albionnica, dwell the Wild Elves. Huge, fey and barbaric; they slay all who attempt to invade their forests with stone blades and summoned creatures, sacrificing those who survive to their dark and heathen gods.\nSome models available through this campaign are Kickstarter Promo Miniatures which will never go on sale in standard retail outlets or my online store.\nAny backers can purchase a Promo Miniature for the price shown on its picture. However, backers at ADVENTURER, SKIRMISH, ONSLAUGHT and MASSACRE get Promo Credits. These can be traded in for the miniatures you would like!\nThere are also other special models available too!\nThanks to the generosity of all our backers, helping to break down Stretch Goals, the ArcWorlde Kickstarter has grown to include a last-minute extra warband, a wide range of beasts and other cool add-ons that can be added to your pledge!\nBeyond the jagged Jernspeak mountain range to the east of Upper ArcWorlde lie the dark lands of Gaulag. Little is known of this place, as it is infested with many evil things, but a threat that is becoming all too real are the Hobgoblins. Nomadic warriors and slavers, in recent years they have ravaged the lands of Upper ArcWorlde. Those who survive their raids are taken hostage, to be sold as slaves to the mysterious powers that fester within Gaulag, and grow stronger each and every day\u2026\nPlease note \u2013 The Hobgoblins of the Gaulag Wastes are a late addition to this campaign, and therefore you CANNOT include them as a warband choice for any of the standard pledges - WARBAND, ADVENTURER, RESIN ADVENTURER, SKIRMISH, RESIN SKIRMISH, ONSLAUGHT, RESIN ONSLAUGHT and MASSACRE. \nHowever, they WILL BE INCLUDE in the Bespoke Pledges - CHAMPION, MONSTER and, of course, THE EMPIRICAL PLEDGE.\n If \u00a357.k is hit the Leviathan will gain a Deck Expansion!\nAnd if the amazing amount of \u00a360k is hit I can offer Forgotten Tombs as an add-on!\nBelow is a list of all the Stretch Goals that have already been passed in this campaign. Their contents have been added into the Warbands, Perks and Add-on sections to make them easier to locate.\nFor updates on this Kickstarter and all things Warploque Miniatures you can \u2018like\u2019 the Warploque Miniatures Facebook page.\nThis is the perfect way to share your enthusiasm for the Kickstarter with friends, family, enemies, bullies, pets, and other mythical beasts. The more support the project has, the higher the chance of unlocking juicy Stretch Goals!\nYou can also check the Warploque Miniatures website. It is currently under maintenance, but I will be developing it over the course of this campaign, so expect something awesome soon!\nPLEASE NOTE - All ArcWorlde miniatures will be supplied unpainted and with standard, round lip-edged bases unless you opt for either the Brushlicker or Brushmaster pledge.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAny undertaking of this nature is a huge commitment and a lot of work for everyone involved. Miniatures need sculpting, manufacturing, packing and eventually shipping to the backers. Books and any extras also need to be produced and shipped. \n\nIt is at these hurdles that some Kickstarters have faltered in the past, so, I have given careful consideration to each part of the process to minimise potential risk.\n\nInstead of relying purely on concept art and work-in-progress sculpts to \nillustrate my products, all of the initial models that I am offering have already been completed. The first four warbands, as well as the Kickstarter Exclusive miniature are ready to go into production. I also have many more miniatures sculpted, so backers know exactly what they are investing in.\n\nI personally financed the casting of these models in resin before the Kickstarter launch. These are the first production masters, cutting down on lead in times after the campaign has finished. I already have a local caster ready to begin the production of these ArcWorlde models in white metal.\n\nThe rulebook is currently being refined, with final art and new layout templates being added, but a beta version of the rules has been online for several months, and has been extensively playtested for an even longer period. Systems have been refined based on this feedback to make the rules and background even better. \n\nI have arranged the first rulebook run with a reputable book printer. They are well-regarded for delivering high-quality products in a timely fashion.\n\nTo ensure the campaign runs smoothly I will be working on it full-time and I have enlisted a second pair of hands (and the other body parts required too) so that all your questions can be answered and updates can be posted at all hours.\n\nFinally, I have set achievable delivery date estimates. This will increase the likelihood that product will be delivered on time or, perhaps even ahead of schedule.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #130", "update_userinfo": "The newest chapter of ArcWorlde... now on Kickstarter!", "update_content": "Ho there, ArcFans!\nHope you are all well!\nI just thought I would let you all know that I have just launched the next chapter of ArcWorlde's story  - Troubles in the North...\n "}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #129", "update_userinfo": "PDF Rulebook Ahoy!", "update_content": "Hey guys,\nI know that this campaign is officially \"over\", but I thought that I would keep posting ArcWorlde news here to keep you all up to date on the game and range you helped to create :)\nAnyhoo, on to the new figures!"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #128", "update_userinfo": "New Monsters released!", "update_content": "Hey guys!\nWell, this is a very special update, a very special one indeed.\nI am delighted to announce that the ArcWorlde Kickstarter rulebooks have been dropped off at Mantic Games to be shipped later this week.
