She just wants to be free, she tells Andrea; she wants to see and enjoy the world.\n\nAndrea can relate. And as thanks for her rescue, Carmen offers an incredible reward: eternal life.\nBut this promise of an eternal and exciting future not wasn't what it seemed. And if Darra\u2014 and her newfound ally, Liam, who has known Carmen far too well for far too long\u2014 don't play rescuers themselves, Andrea will surely come to regret her strange and deadly bargain.\nStars, Hide Your Fire is a 162-page, full-color graphic novel, suitable for middle grade readers and up.\n\nWe've done our best to estimate shipping costs, but please remember that these are only estimates.

Part haunted-house tale, part psychedelic fever dream, the story is driven by a vivid cast of characters:\nKeziah Mason, the witch who uses advanced mathematics to travel through time and space; Brown Jenkin, her terrifying rat familiar; and Narylathotep, a sinister Elder deity. This unsettling trio haunt the dreams of hapless Walter Gilman, the Miskatonic University student who became too curious about the ancient Witch House.\nThe Part Flamingo Press edition of The Dreams in the Witch House features full-color illustrations by artist Adam Pernell Deal and the original text of Lovecraft\u2019s tale. \n\"Old Keziah Mason\"\nH.P. Lovecraft\nBlending elements of fantasy, science fiction, and supernatural horror, The Dreams in the Witch House is part of Lovecraft\u2019s Dream Cycle--a series of stories about alternate dimensions entered through dreams, and set in the Lovecraftian universe known as the Cthulhu Mythos. \nIn his lifetime Lovecraft published short stories in pulp magazines and amateur sci-fi publications. He died in poverty and obscurity in 1937. Since his death, Lovecraft\u2019s following has only increased. Today, he is the most well-known founder of the weird fiction genre, and his work has inspired some of the most celebrated horror writers and filmmakers of our time. Neil Gaiman, Guillermo del Toro, and John Carpenter all credit Lovecraft's influence on their work.\n\u201cHe must go with them all to the throne of Azathoth at the centre of ultimate chaos.\u201d\nCollector\u2019s Edition\nThe Part Flamingo Press edition of The Dreams in the Witch House will be beautifully bound and illustrated--a quality edition for book-lovers and collectors.

In 2019 he co-founded Part Flamingo Press to produce unusual books with an elegant aesthetic. The first book issued by Part Flamingo is the picture book, Knoxville Mermaid. It features linen hardback binding, gold foil lettering, printed endpapers, and other luxe details. It was printed by Edition One, who will print The Dreams in the Witch House.\nWorking exclusively in pencil, ink, and watercolor, Deal\u2019s \u201cotherworldly illustrations give a surreal aspect to even mundane subjects.\u201d --Kirkus Reviews\nLovecraft\u2019s imagery is dense and vivid, especially in the passages describing Walter Gilman\u2019s dreams.\n\u201cGilman sometimes compared the inorganic masses to prisms, labyrinths, clusters of cubes and planes, and Cyclopean buildings...groups of bubbles, octopi, centipedes...and intricate Arabesques roused into a kind of ophidian animation.\u201d\nDream Abyss\nThese alien dreamscapes present a unique challenge and opportunity for Deal, an artist known for his imaginative and unsettling imagery.\nDeal\u2019s illustrations for The Dreams in the Witch House portray the characters Brown Jenkin, Keziah, Nyarlathotep, and Walter Gilman; the abysses and Cyclopean cities; Gilman\u2019s dramatic battle with Keziah, and the crumbling witch house. \nSome of Deal's original art for the book is available as pledge rewards.\nCyclopean City\n100% American-made\nOur printer, Edition One, is located in Berkeley, California.

We believe our books speak for themselves and hope by presenting our quality work, we will find our people. We hope to have these books printed and available by the winter holidays.

The demon might just be the ghost of an alien queen, Wrathia, seeking revenge on the one that destroyed her empire, a god-like figure named Titan.\nThe story follows Ava as she makes her way across the universe, teaming up with the demon haunting her on a quest for revenge, while fighting her own inner demons along the way. I've been working on this story since 2012 and now that I've crossed the halfway point of the series, I\u2019ve partnered with comic book publisher Skybound to bring you the definitive edition of AVA'S DEMON in print form!\n\"Reading the dark and colorful AVA'S DEMON feels like watching a tv series... all I want to do is binge it!\" - SWEENEY BOO\nWe need to raise $25,000 for our Kickstarter Campaign to be a success! With that, we can bring you the Kickstarter Exclusive version of AVA'S DEMON BOOK 1: REBORN as well as my first ever art book!

Should we reach our stretch goals, the book will also include brand new Ava\u2019s Demon short stories made just for this volume by me and my wonderful team!  \n\"Every drawing Michelle makes hints at a deeper, richer world behind it. Their work has that beautiful balance of storytelling and pure aesthetic indulgence--it's beautiful to look at and makes you want to know more. \" - LOIS VAN BAARLE aka LOISH\nA beautifully made 104-page hardcover art book featuring my work over the past 8 years, including some never-before-seen Ava\u2019s Demon illustrations!

Your continued support has literally made Ava\u2019s Demon possible and I couldn't be more grateful.

This Kickstarter is to print the first volume, containing 100 pages, in paperback. Consider helping me make this come to life, and get a copy for your bookshelf!\n\nMy Illustrated Life started in December of 2017 from an assignment in college. I've had a ton of fun making more comics since then and this December is the comic's 3rd anniversary!\nThe comic is series of journal comics, so you can expect the usual slice of life comics in here. There's also some funny moments from my DnD sessions with friends and even some comics about video games. There's a little bit of something for a variety of tastes! There is of course, a whole lot of comics with my cats. (What can I say? I love the little quirky goofballs.) You'll also find the rest of my family in some comics, and even my friends starring along side me on occassion.\nThe main reward is, of course, the book! This book will be a 9x9\" square paperback book with 100 pages. There's new art for title pages and of course, the cover. Every physical book will come signed as thanks for pledging towards the campaign!\nPLEASE NOTE: These are just mockups for the book and not not 100% a representation of what the book will look like. \nAside from the book being something you can get from this Kickstarter, there's also a poster made by me. This will be 11\" x 17\" in full color from CatPrint!\nThe other rewards besides the book, depend on how much you pledge. You could get a doodle on the inside of the cover, an A5 sized drawing (related to the comic) or even a digital commission!\nI prepared some stretch goals just in case we surpass the original goal! Anything physical that's unlocked will be also available as an add-on when the backer-kit is sent out at the end of August 2020.\nI'll also be putting out more information about these stretch goals as we gete close to funding them! So keep an eye out for updates!\nI've never run a sucessful Kickstarter before, but I've been researching through Kickstarters I'd backed and through people documenting their process; as well as asking questions of my friend Bryan Ballinger - who sucessfuly funded his Animal Gas campaign.  Aside from asking questions, I am the only one running this Kickstarter. I've taken that into account and made sure I'm not adding too many rewards that would slow me down in regards to delivering things on time. However, we all know the postal system can be difficult at times, and as long as all the rewards get to me I will always update backers should anything get in the way of delivering this at my promised time.  As this is my first Kickstarter, I'm very open to learning how to make things better, especially for my backers. I can be reached in the comments and through messaging on Kickstarter, so I can make sure this process goes as smoothly as possible.\nThis image breaks down where the money is going for our initial goal of $1,900. Most of it, of course, is going towards getting the book printed. I have also set some aside to ship your orders to you and to make sure we have the kickstarter fees covered. There's some leftover as a buffer to make sure that we have enough to get everything printed and shipped out as safely as possible!\nThanks so much for taking a look at this Kickstarter. If you can't pledge any money to the campaign at this time, you can always share this with your friends and family. Maybe even ask someone to back it as a present for you? Any support is always helpful, and I appreciate you taking a look!\nKickstarter is a crowdfunding platform that brings people together in order to create things. Your payment is not taken out until (or IF) the project funds by its deadline. If the project is completed, I will send out a backer survey to get additional information from you, such as; adresses for physical rewards, emails for digital rewards, letting you add any aditional items and any other information that I may need to get your rewards to you.

Each episode costs hundreds of thousands of euros, and producing a complete season takes several years, during which time we need to pay the artists' salaries, the utility bills and lots of other expenses, even while the series itself isn't generating any income.\n\nThis is why a series can only be produced with the help of one or more distributors who, beyond merely taking interest in a project, commit to supporting the creation of the series all the way through to broadcast, ensuring that it reaches its target audience.\n\nUnfortunately, WAKFU's evolution toward more mature themes has been an obstacle to this process so far. We still haven't managed to convince the distributors to help us with this project, although we're continuing our talks with them!\n\nWe've got one card left up our sleeve: funding the creation of season 4 ourselves, with your help.

{"campaign": {"story": "Hi! We're Erika Moen and Matthew Nolan and we make sex education comics! \nIn this Kickstarter we're making a follow-up to our first purely sex-education comic book, Drawn to Sex: The Basics. While that first book covered... well, the basics of doin' it, this follow up, Our Bodies and Health, will cover the more science-y and biology-y side of sex. \nOur comics are frank, friendly, and fun. They're here to demystify the world of sex, teach you about your amazing body, and answer your questions\u2014including the ones you didn't know you had!\nDrawn to Sex\nAfter 7 years making weekly sex-related comics on Oh Joy Sex Toy, we've finally acquired enough material for a dedicated line of books purely devoted to educational topics: It's the Drawn to Sex series! We launched with The Basics, a collection of our comics on the fundamentals of having sex.\nIn this second volume, Our Bodies and Health, we're focusing on the biology and science of our bodies and reproductive organs. Its 200+ pages cover the subjects of anatomy, pregnancy, abortion, menstruation, menopause, check-ups, STIs, and more. All of these strips are already available for free on Oh Joy Sex Toy. \nIt'll be 6x9\" with fancy french flaps, softcover (so it's easy to pick up and read), and full color. We'll even give the cover a fancy spot-gloss!\nWe're aiming to get the books to you in November 2020, but understandably there might be delays because of COVID-19. We'll make sure to stay informed and drop you updates if we have them as we go.\nHere's what people have said about our work!\n Drawn to Sex - The Basics, rated at 4.7 stars on Amazon and 4.57 stars on Goodreads, with over 250 reviews.\n \u201cErika Moen is fucking amazing and this book will change your life for the better.\u201d Emily Nagoski, PhD \n \"...the sexual education that everyone in the world needs. One of the most queer-friendly, colorful, and out-right positive webcomics out there.\" Tara Marie, Comics Alliance \n \u201cA great and hilarious resource - some of the best sex ed out there!\u201d - Dan Savage \n \u201cThis is a sex-positive gulp of fresh air.\u201d - Publishers Weekly \n(more quotes and accolades can be found on our Press page!)\nSome sample pages!\nBook Mockup!\n Guest Comics\nTry as we might, we simply can't cover everything under the sun, so we reach out to as many other artists as we can each year to contribute their own work. They add their diverse and unique voices to our collection of comics. In this year's book, we'll be including the following 8 guest comics:\nBody Image Blues By Bingo\nPeyronie\u2019s Disease by Bingo\nMenopause by Ashley Guillory\nPregnancy Sex by Boum\nPoly Cystic Ovarian Syndrome by Ainsley Yeager\nAIDS, HIV and PrEP by Silver\nBilateral Salpingectomy by Rosalarian\nVestibulodynia by Alex Assan\nWe'll be dropping these artists a $100 bonus per comic if this all funds (on top of what they were originally paid to make said comics), and will scale that up if the Kickstarter does super well!\nRewards\nWe like to keep things simple - no rolling extras or hundreds of add-ons. Just the book, PDF, and some bookplates to stick into the book! We'll also offer up some of the previous OJST volumes to keep things interesting. \n $1 - Exclusive Wallpaper: Background for your devices. \n$8 - Book PDF\n $12 - Early Bird Special: PDF and physical book: Limited first-come-first-served as a thank you for early adopters!\n$20 - The physical book\n$30 - Signed physical book\n $36 - BOTH Drawn to Sex books \n $50 - BOTH Drawn to Sex books AND a random Oh Joy Sex Toy book: Worth  $70 in stores, these three books are the perfect introduction to what we do and great bang for your buck. The OJST volumes are bigger, have more of our comics, and are filled with guest artist comics as well!\n $55 - A doodled physical book: Bookplate comes with a quick doodle from Erika to stick inside your book.\n $125 - A UNIQUE illustration in your physical book: Erika draws a one-of-a-kind illustration onto a bookplate for you to secure inside your book!\n $1069 - Unique illustrated physical book and we'll take you out for coffee if you're ever in Portland.  \nWe're aiming to do fulfillment ourselves if the number of backers is small and then use the fine folks at Make That Thing if there wind up being a whole lot of you!\nIf you're not really interested in getting a book but still want to support us, check out our Patreon here! \n\nUnder the Hood Stuff\nWhy do we need Kickstarter? It's the most direct way for you to get our work and for us to fund our tiny business. We've been using this space for years in order to take pre-orders for our books. Since Oh Joy Sex Toy debuted in 2013, our Kickstarter book pre-orders are an essential way we raise the funds not only to produce our beautiful books, but to compensate us for the year's worth of labor that goes into making them, and to crowdfund paying the dozens of guest cartoonists we work with each year a professional rate for their comics.\nThis Kickstarter gets us paid to build this book, fills our basement with copies to sell at conventions, and ensures we keep making comics and hiring artists on OJST.\nErika and Matt\nWe're in our 30s and love the world of sex. It's our full-time job! Together we write and make every comic. Erika is responsible for all the drawings while Matthew colors them and handles all the other business and book-making bits.\nErika is a 16-ish year comics veteran in Portland, OR. She has a desk at Helioscope (Formerly Periscope Studio) and her work has been published by Dark Horse Comics, Image Comics, Villard, BOOM! Studios, Penny Arcade, Scholastic, and Limerence Press, among many others.\nWhereas Matt's only been doing the comics business truffle shuffle for the past 7 years - puuuffft, what an amateur.\nLicenses and Thank Yous\nSome thanks to a few people for helping make this Kickstarter possible.\nWe're working with Limerence Press again this year to help print the book and to distribute it into stores and libraries. Thank you, team!\n Make That Thing is gonna help out if we need extra fulfillment. They are the bees' knees.\nThe music used in the video is 'Cute' by BenSounds.

Spike here, founder of Iron Circus Comics and writer of Yes, Roya.\nYes, Roya is a comic I'm exceptionally proud of. It embodies of a lot of the principles of Iron Circus erotica: consent-driven, sex-positive, and thoughtfully plotted. It was one of those Iron Circus books that proved to so many creators that there was a market for this kind of material. And it proved to so many more readers that material like this was being made. It opened the door for so much!\nBut Yes, Roya was originally published in 2016. And, back then, money was just a bit tighter, and our printing connections just a little less solid. We couldn't imagine printing something like this in color. The option wasn't there!\nHowever, the last of the original print run is quickly disappearing; fewer than fifty copies remain. It's time for a reprint. And maybe... an improvement?\nIron Circus Comics has brought aboard experienced professional colorist (and Hugo Award nominee!) Kelly Fitzpatrick to do Emilee Denich's pages some justice, and the prelims she's turned in are already blowing our socks off! The entirety of the story will be brought to life with fantastic mid-century flair: a lot of burnt orange and moss green.\n...Hooray?\nWhatever. I'm just foolin' with ya, it's gonna be great. Check out the sample pages below!\nPage 12!\nPage 30!\nPage 82!\nI'm new to all this. What is \"Yes, Roya?\"\nOh wow, you are in for a TREAT. \nYes, Roya is a 150-page m/f/m femdom graphic novel, set in 1960s California, about what happens when a young, aspiring cartoonist meets his idol, and discovers his hero \u2014 and his hero's wife, Roya \u2014 are anything but your typical mid-century couple.\nIt's an Amazon bestseller in three categories with a five-star average review on both Amazon and Barnes & Noble, and critically-acclaimed by the likes of The AV Club and Oh Joy Sex Toy. We're very proud of this book, and can't wait to give it new life with color!\nBut hey now, what about a Stretch Goal?\nHa ha ha, just kidding! Sure!\nIf this project hits $10,000, we'll bring back Yes, Roya's artist, Emilee Denich, to create an all-new cover for the color edition! Something fun. N' sexy. She's good at that.\nHere's a rough draft of what it could look like!\nAnd... yeah, that's pretty much it! This project is keeping it simple, with a modest goal and just two weeks to fund. We know we can make it, with your help!\nPlease, spread word of this Kickstarter far and wide, and help get us to our goal!\nThanks so much, everybody!

It's about a robot!\nHi! We're the Doubleclicks: Aubrey Turner (she/her) and Laser Malena-Webber (they/them). We're a sibling musical duo from Portland, Oregon, who make indie folk music about love, science, and anxiety. We have a cello, we have a ukulele, we have a cat keyboard that goes meow meow meow.\nYou can listen to our music on YouTube, Spotify, or Bandcamp for free!\nWe're known for making music on the Internet with you, other human beings. We also tour and play places like PAX, the JoCoCruise, SF Sketchfest, GenCon, and comics shops, game stores, and comedy clubs. We've released a handful of albums, four of them through the help of Kickstarter, and we want to do it again! Are you ready?   \n Our 7th studio album, Teaching a Robot to Love, is 12 songs about the things we care about. IT IS ALSO: a musical. With a plot. About artificial intelligence and the true nature of \"humanity.\" It's funny, and cute, and real, and all the things that Doubleclicks albums normally are. \nWhy this project, why now? The Doubleclicks started in a dorm room 10 years ago. That's wild. We've been writing dozens of nerdy songs about our feelings for a long, long time. What we haven't done is finished something truly ambitious and narrative. This is a huge challenge\u2014much, much harder than we anticipated. But after a few false starts on different musicals (sorry, abandoned projects, we will be back someday...), we have finally completed writing the music and words to a story we're really proud of!!!\nThis project is happening in three parts:\n1. Doubleclicks songs\u2014a whole grip of Doubleclicks songs about anxiety, friendship, love, art, cheese, and our lives.\n2. The audio drama/cast album\u2014most of these very same songs, plus a few more, fit themselves into a MUSICAL. With just a few little narration pieces, a cast of characters, and bonus songs, we will provide you with a full audio drama version of this musical which is a full story about a robot!! There will be talented folks playing all the characters \u2014 and the two main characters are played by the Doubleclicks. \nBoth the digital album and the CD will contain the \"Cast Album\" along with bonus Doubleclicks versions of some songs.\n3. The staged-reading/video\u2014we will at least be producing one on-book staged reading of the musical, and we will film it when it happens. Backers will get a digital version of the video, and anyone who orders the USB will get the video on there as well.\n4. Bonus process streams\u2014Because of quarantine, we are going to be live-streaming the creative process of this musical as much as possible. You can watch the first quarantine concert we did here! Stay tuned to the updates tab on this page and to the Doubleclicks Discord for more announcements! We've already had fun writing the script with some of you in our co-working streams on YouTube\u2014thank you, Team Productivity!  \nWhat's next? Staging a full musical with costumes and choreography is a task that will require some outside funding and production, but we are looking into that, using this album and the funds from this project as a starting point for pitches and workshops. Our dreams include creating a script and sheet music for a full production. To do this, we will need to give ourselves an extension on the amount of time to dedicate to this project\u2014so... yes, this is a stretch goal question.   \nThe Doubleclicks are a crowd-funded, indie operation. With no major record label, we depend completely on our audience to help us make our art. The advantage of that\u2014and this is huge\u2014is that there is nothing between us and you. Our music goes straight from our hearts to your ears. We love it. It means so much to us to be able to make just the thing we want and just the thing you want, too. If you don't like it, we can't make it. So we do our very best.\n   We need your help to pay for recording and our studio rent; to hire musicians and vocalists, to produce CDs, merchandise, and promotional items for the album; to get the necessary software, instruments, and plug-ins; to master and mix the music; to submit the music to iTunes and other music stores; and to generally \"create something from nothing.\" \n  We thank you for supporting art and artists, and for making the world more beautiful, especially right now! Nothing can stop our wackiness. Nothing!!\nA note about timing:\n We know that right now is really tough for a lot of people\u2014financially, emotionally, and everything. This was a genuinely difficult choice, but we decided to launch this project now anyway, because making music is our job, and this project pays our salaries. We would be in financial trouble if we didn't keep making music and if we didn't launch this project. However, we recognize that financial strain is real for many of our fans, and so our songs will still be online for everyone to listen to for free after the project is done. In fact, we just made all our old albums free to download on Bandcamp. Also, we are creating NO Kickstarter-exclusives on this project; if it's on this project, you'll be able to get it later. If you are able to donate, we, our cats, and our families appreciate it! If not\u2014please feel our love and support! \nThe Musical/The Story:\nStacy is a lonely, work-obsessed programmer tasked with building the next big advertising artificial intelligence (AI)\u2014a Google-Siri-Alexa-Facebook hybrid\u2014a profitable program that will sell people things based on their behavior in new and unprecedented ways. But when her program, MarshCom, becomes self aware and realizes that people don\u2019t need to buy things to be happy, Stacy is fired, and she takes her program with her.\nWith the help of her lab-tech roommate Jamie, Stacy finds Marsh an android body and they both start their new lives\u2014Stacy as unemployed, and Marsh as the first brand-new, artificially created, completely synthetic human being. When Stacy becomes jealous of Marsh and a fight turns into a city-threatening computer glitch, new friends need to come together to save the day\u2014or lose everything they\u2019ve gained.\n\u201cTeaching a Robot to Love\u201d is a musical about friendship, love, being human, asking for help, and the costs and benefits of loudly being one\u2019s self.\nStacy is played by Aubrey, and Marsh is played by Laser! More casting announcements to come. \nThe Songs:\nCast album/musical track list (click links to listen to demos!):\nEverybody Needs Someone\nFlipping a Switch\nThe Wrong Body*\nNothing To See Here*\nDo Science At Home!\nHow To Be A Person\n Normal Human Party *\nLet's Just Be Friends\nI Know Too Much\nI'm Right\nHack the Mainframe\n Cheddar*\nEverybody Needs Someone (Reprise)\n*Doubleclicks bonus version will also be recorded/included\nWant to listen to a song from the musical? \nThe Pins:\nDesigned by Meghan Murphy! You will get your choice of \"Rockin Robot\" and \"Sensitive Badass\" pin \u2014 and if you can't decide, you can add on the other pin after the project!\nThe Shirt: \nThe new Doubleclicks shirt is designed by Natalie Metzger and will be available in \"unisex\" and \"fitted/ladies\" sizes S-3XL. We will have size charts available for you so you can get just the right shirt! (This is just a mock-up based on an early sketch\u2014the final shirt design will be more polished)\nThe Dice:\nWe are creating an all-new set of three six-sided dice for 2020 featuring these designs: A party cat, a robot, and a T-rex! Here's what our dice look like, but these are old designs. The new ones will be NEW and have different pictures! \nPrevious Doubleclicks Dice design pictured - new dice will have different designs\nPrinted by Chessex! \nThe USB Drive:\n4GB USB Drive\nThe new Doubleclicks USB drive will include all the albums the Doubleclicks have released, plus the new Cast Album & Doubleclicks song bonuses, and a video recording of the staged reading of the musical. It will also have a video of our hour-long concert special \"Uncomfortable In Public,\" exclusive ringtones, and coloring pages. Earlybird USBs will be signed!\n Add-Ons:\nIf you need multiple shirts, dice sets, USBs\u2014we got you. There will be an add-on store launched after the Kickstarter ends through BackerKit. You don't need to worry about it now, but if you want to, you can add $10 for pins, $10 for dice, $15 for CDs, $30 for shirts, or $50 for USBs on to your pledge.   \nProjects like this take a whole bunch of people to make possible and we'd like to thanks some of them! Kim Newmoney took the photos on this page, and is amazing. The piano in our video and for \"Normal Human Party\" is by the talented Sam Johnides. Our Patrons have helped us get through a year of touring and a winter of songwriting, and are amazing. Our parents are extremely lovely, talented and supportive and we are thankful for them. Richard and Marzipan are the true heroes of this Kickstarter.

It began as just one idea that exploded into an exploration of concepts I grew up knowing; Looking through a more critical lens and being honest with my visceral reactions and my learned, habitual reactions. \nCurrently I have four completed pieces with a fifth one built as an empty concept, which will be better understood in the context of the whole series. The finished collection will be a total of eight pieces. I\u2019m preparing a lot of layers for the opening show and *this* is one magnificent one! \nEach painting tells a story in its pieces. There are some things that I\u2019ve shared online, with my patrons on Patreon, or with people who have been in my studio. But, for the most part, a lot of the stories are still locked up inside of me.\nI think the most valuable thing to this series is what makes up the paintings. And I\u2019m really excited to tell those stories in a little zine, what I intend to be the show booklet. I\u2019ve always liked to have a little blurb with each painting at any of my concept shows. I feel like this show and these paintings have so much weight to them, that if someone wants to just see art, they can walk by each painting and feel pleased with the imagination and rich colors. But if someone wants to see the paintings and know the meaning, getting a booklet and reading about each piece could be a really special experience. \nAfter finishing St Anne\u2014my first painting\u2014I knew that I wanted this series to be a community effort. I felt really alone in my journey, but knew it didn\u2019t have to be that way if I opened it up to other people. I shared the concept with some fellow artists and planned some collaborations. Those will be included in their own ways in updates and the show itself. But now, I want to include you! \nI know there are a lot of people who have been following my series, but wouldn\u2019t be in Knoxville for the opening. And I thought asking for community help on building my booklet would be a really meaningful way for me to bring the book into fruition. This way the book has a chance to be and those who can\u2019t make it to the show can experience it in these pages.\nRight now I\u2019m not sure when the show will even be happening due to some change in plans. Ideally it will be closer to the end of the year, but may not happen until next year. The book production and printing will take some time, a few months at least. But everything else will take just a couple of months. These are all things I\u2019ll be keeping everyone up to date with in my posts. \nMaking and printing this books feels like the necessary next step in this artistic journey and I\u2019m really excited to see where else it takes us. \nP.S. This campaign is a \u201dMake/100 project\u201d, because Kickstarter is hosting a larger community project this January where creators can launch projects that either have 100 of one unique, limited item, or capping it at 100 backers. *I* have only 100 reward slots for 100 backers.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI imagined that local supporters could pick their booklets up at the show itself, but if the show doesn\u2019t happen for another year and the books are finished within three months of the campaign finishing\u2014assuming I make my goal\u2014then everyone will receive their books before the show takes place.\n\nBuilding the format of a book can be challenging and communicating with the Printer can be a whole thing, therefore it\u2019s possible the book won\u2019t be available until winter. But when they\u2019re finished, I\u2019ll send them ASAP, whenever that is.\n\nI did my best to set an attainable financial goal with realistic and affordable products that will still be quality. Kickstarter asks that you build in a percentage to set aside for taxes. So my goals reflect those things. I may have to pay some shipping out of pocket, or even taxes during tax season, but I\u2019m willing to risk those things, because I feel like this project is really important.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "Postcard directly from the monastery", "descp": "Receive a postcard of a surprise print from the series with a handwritten note!\nINCLUDES:\nPostcard", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Only United States"}], "stat": ["2 backers", "Limited (48 left of 50)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 20 or more", "title": "The Monastery zine", "descp": "Get yourself 1/50 limited copies of The Monestery zine.

We have now unlocked the Artificer, Ally, Mystic, Blood Hunter, Companion and Familiar cards (two each). Plus we have unlocked the Beast, Undead, Aberration, Ooze, Monstrosity, Plant, Giant, Fiend, The Elemental, The Construct, Celestial, the Fey, Humanoid, and Dragon monster cards (4 additional cards each).  Plus two bonus unlocks, one Developer card, and one Designer card. And a bonus new class we're creating to use the deck in 5E gameplay (2 more cards). (102 cards total)\n(Unlocked!) While each card will not have a unique design, each card will have color variations to make it easier to tell them apart. Additionally each monster card will have unique gold text in the spirit of tarot \"I OF ADVERSARIES\", \"II OF ADVERSARIES\", etc.\nThe deck also includes a beautiful matching 2-piece box with a luxurious matte finish, and an instruction booklet, so you can use the deck as an initiative system, conduct oracle readings for your friends or their characters in-game, or use the deck as an actual magic item that can be found in the game.\nWhat's not included? \nThis is not a traditional \"Rider-Waite\" Tarot deck. This means the Major and Minor Arcana are not written on the cards and there is no direct one-to-one conversion to every card in the traditional deck. \nInstead, we are including an original cartomancy guide to use the deck for divination (see below for details.) \nThe Adventurer's Tarot was originally envisioned as an alternative streamlined, initiative system. \n\n\nWe've playtested this system extensively in our home games and at conventions, and we think it's a great alternative to regular D&D initiative. While Dexterity players do take a minor hit, there are significant advantages to this system:\n Quicker Setup; instead of players yelling out numbers around the table to determine initiative, just setup the deck for the combat, shuffle the deck, and begin.\n It creates tension; no one knows who will go next in turn order. Will the second group of monsters go next, or will Alechin the cleric be able to cast a Healing Word before curtains close on Rogers the bard?\n More chaotic combat; combat order changes each round, better representing the chaos of combat.\n Player Engagement;  With the future of the turn unknown, players need to actively think about what their character will do if they go next, instead of spacing out until their turn. (Not that we've ever seen a player space out waiting for their turn to come up!)\nWhat about Lair Actions? The Alert feat? Non D&D Classes? We have special rules for all that, and more in our detailed rules which will be included with the deck. You can see our current draft of the rules here:\n\n\n\nThe Adventurer's Tarot Magic Item \nAdditionally, we will include printed rules for using the Adventurer's Tarot as a magic item in 5th Edition Dungeons & Dragons. This item will function in a similar way to the infamous Deck of Many Things, but be less prone to causing major character changes, disastrous backfires, and campaign-shattering alterations.\nClick here for the Work In Progress Magic Item Rules\n\n\n\nUNLOCKED!\n\n Instagram \n Facebook \n\n\nFulfillment\nOur hard copy proof\nShortly after the Kickstarter ends, we will be sending you a link where you will be able to complete checkout for your backing. This will include the option to purchase additional Add-Ons. We have signed a contract with PledgeManager to provide our post-campaign pledge management.\nWe currently have a hard copy proof and a printer lined up for this deck which means we are ready to go to print. However, we have many new card and artwork stretch goals. Based on the number of stretch goals unlocked, there will likely be additional work for Brenda to create the artwork. If we determine that Brenda needs more time to complete the artwork, we will notify you, our backers, in a timely fashion with a new delivery date. \nWe delivered our last Kickstarter exactly on time, and we are planning to do so again with this one.\nShipping\nSince we are shipping a relatively small and lightweight product, we are able to charge a flat rate for shipping throughout the world.   The price for shipping is for the base deck of cards. \nThanks to the popularity of the Kickstarter with Europeans, we quickly realized we needed to provide EU-Friendly fulfillment. We have partnered with Spiral Galaxy Games based in the UK to provide us with EU-Friendly shipping.  \nWe also have Australia and New Zealand-friendly shipping provided by fulfillment partner Unicorn Games. \nProducts in the US will be either shipped USPS First Class or USPS Priority depending on the size. All non-US and non-AU/NZ international products will be shipped either USPS First Class International or USPS First Class Priority (for larger items.)\nAbout Weird Works\nWeird Works is a small, independent game studio that specializes in creating peculiar products for your tabletop RPGs. \nBrenda Ho (Designer & Illustrator)\nBrenda is a freelance graphic designer based in the beautiful & rainy Pacific Northwest, where she lives with her cats Duke and Lilith.

If that's the case, we plan on notifying our backers well ahead of the deadline (preferable shortly after the completion of the Kickstarter) with our new intended delivery date.\n\nAdditionally, we are heavily reliant on Brenda Ho to complete the artwork for the campaign.

Our four previous installments have established not only a fantastic precedent of killer collections, but literally invented the gold standard of anthology payouts, rewarding artists with nice, big bonuses when the project takes off.\nSmut Peddler Presents: Silver is...\nOur fifth Smut Peddler anthology,\nOur third FULL-COLOR anthology, and\nOur third themed anthology!\nAnd returning for a great, big ol' victory lap, this is another Smut Peddler Catch-Up Project!\nNot only can you grab Silver, but every other smutty anthology Iron Circus Comics has ever put out, at a GREAT BIG DISCOUNT!

Weaver\nRowan Woodcock\nScroll down a bit for some sneak-peeks of their work!\nSmut Peddler Presents: Silver has only one stretch goal: a cover enhancement at $25,000!  We really, REALLY want some foil on Mirjam L\u00f6fgren's amazing cover; no points for guessing which color we'll be going for. \nBut our stretch goals for Silver end there. Iron Circus was the first publisher to include Kickstarter-based bonuses as a part of their projects, and we're continuing that tradition of rewarding our creators with this project.\nThis pre-order event will determine the bonuses of our authors. That bonus is a $5.00 page rate increase every $5,000 the Kickstarter makes over goal. That means the more work an artist has put in, the more they stand to make. This is on top of the page rates they've already earned, and there's no cap on potential pay.\nPre-ordering Smut Peddler Presents: Silver directly benefits the creators and the work you love!\nWe love all our children equally, of course. But real talk? Smut Peddler Presents: Silver is easily one of the most beautiful anthologies we've put together to date. Check it out! \n\"William Wilson and the Man on a Mission,\" by E.K.

My name is Dawn and I am a natural science illustrator in Richmond, Virginia.\nAbout a year ago I stumbled upon The Deck of Many Things during a D&D campaign. This deck is a wondrous item in Dungeons & Dragons that contains 22 cards, each of which have a magical effect on the player. To use the Deck of Many Things the player must declare the number of cards they wish to draw, then randomly draw their cards and let fate take the wheel. \nThis deck really sparked my imagination, leading me to start drawing my own cards. For the past year the Flora & Fauna Deck of Many Things has become my passion project. I wanted to create artwork that marries the magic of the fantasy world with natural science illustration. The artwork is completed, and I would love your help in bringing The Flora & Fauna Deck of Many Things to life!\nShown: Sun, Moon, Star, Throne, Key, Knight, The Void, & Flames.\nShown: Skull, Ruin, Euryale, Rogue, Jester, Vizier, Comet, The Fates\nShown: Gem, Talons, Donjon, Idiot, Fool, Balance, & card back.\n DECK ADD-ON (+$20) \nYou can purchase additional Decks for your pledge by adjusting your pledge amount under the 'Manage your Pledge' Page. Add $20 for every additional Deck you wish to purchase.\nIf you do purchase an add-on please message me directly so I can make a note of the add-on on your pledge!\nPRINTS OF YOUR CHOICE \nTiers 3-6 allow you to choose the card you are getting a print of. If the campaign meets its funding goal you will receive a Kickstarter rewards survey, which is where you will specify which print you would like. You can see all 22 cards in the first three images on this page!\nMANUFACTURING\nFor the physical Flora & Fauna Deck of Many Things I am partnering with PrintNinja to ensure the highest quality project possible. I also have trusted manufacturers lined up for the pins and art prints.\nThe majority of the funding will go towards the manufacturing costs, the rest will go towards packaging costs and Kickstarter fees. \nSHIPPING\nBelow are important things to note in regards to shipping The Deck & any other reward items to you:\n FREE SHIPPING IS INCLUDED FOR ALL US ORDERS. All orders will be sent First-Class via USPS.\n ANY INTERNATIONAL ORDERS FROM OUTSIDE THE US INCLUDE A SHIPPING FEE. The fee charged at checkout includes shipping and nothing more. Any insurance, import/customs fees, taxes, etc. are your responsibility. \n PROVIDE A VALID EMAIL. Reward surveys will be sent out at the completion of the campaign, so the sooner you respond with your address and preferences the sooner your reward can be mailed out to you.\n PROVIDE AN UP-TO-DATE ADRESS ON THE SURVEY. Please ensure that you provide the correct address on your backer survey, including your first and last name. An incorrect address can lead to shipping errors. \nMAKE SURE YOUR CREDIT CARD INFORMATION IS CURRENT.\n STAY UPDATED.

You will journey to a small village filled with magical girls and other fantastical friends, where you are placed in charge of a run down cat caf\u00e9. Build up your caf\u00e9 by filling it with cute furniture, fun decorations, yummy pastries, and get it bustling with animals again!\nIn Calico, you play as a sweet magical cutie. There are two playable characters to choose from: Heartgirl and Flowergirl! \n Which Platforms?\nCalico will release on PC and Mac (steam included), Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and PlayStation 4~\n\nUnlike its inspirations, such as Harvest Moon and Animal Crossing, there are no negative consequences.  Animals will not die, the shop will not close, and the crops will not rot.  Players are free to explore the joy of a heavily stylized world full of cuddly critters. \nCalico is meant to make you feel all warm and fuzzy inside. The gameplay reflects that with a laid back, low stress creative environment to explore and play in.\nExplore the village to find cats and other animals, including raccoons, deer, dogs, turtles, red pandas, foxes, and many, many more cuties!\nThe player will encounter many animals in the world of Calico. Once befriended, you can name them, add them to your party, or send them to their new home at the caf\u00e9. Animals in your party will follow you everywhere you go and listen to your commands. The animals in your cafe will relax and play with any customers that pop in for a visit.\n All animals are interactive!\nAlong with adding animals to your party, Interact with cats and other animals by petting and playing! Some of the animal interactions in Calico will include playing with toys, dancing, cuddling, petting, carrying, lounging with, and pampering. There will even be special features, like placing animals on your head! Special creatures like koi fish will be able to be fed, and the birds would love to be given seeds!  \n We have big plans for the animals' personalities. Their AI will include things like:   \nHappiness, trust, and energy levels  \nHow active, lazy, or hungry they are  \nHow close they like to be to the player  \nDo they like being picked up?\nDo they listen to player commands? \nWhat other animals do they like as friends  \nWhat\u2019s their favorite toy?\nUnique actions exclusive to specific animals And more!\nFor the \u201cYour pet in the game\u201d Kickstarter tiers, we will ask you to describe your pet\u2019s personality and quirks so that their in-game version will properly capture their spirit! \nCalico takes place on a star-shaped island with 6 different environmental areas. In the middle is a heart shaped town where your caf\u00e9 resides!\nCalico is a cat caf\u00e9 in the middle of a small heart shaped town. For those unaware, a cat caf\u00e9 is a caf\u00e9 that includes cats that can be watched and played with. But animal caf\u00e9s are not limited to cats. Some areas have bunny caf\u00e9s, owl caf\u00e9s, or even raccoon caf\u00e9s!\nThis caf\u00e9 is open to all animals, and needs your care to become a welcoming cafe again!\nDecoration\n Your task in Calico is to bring the town's caf\u00e9 back to life again. This isn\u2019t just achieved by bringing in cats and animals alone, however \u2013 you can also decorate your caf\u00e9 with furniture and toys! We will have a full system that allows you to collect and arrange furniture, decorations, and toys. Some furniture is for the caf\u00e9\u2019s human visitors, while other furniture is meant for your animal friends (like cat trees, scratching posts, and dog beds, to name a few options!). \nYummy drinks and dessert in the caf\u00e9\n Create a wonderful caf\u00e9 by making yummy bakes goods and drinks for the townspeople! We will have a system in which you can create and display pastries for sale in the caf\u00e9 display cases, as well as create a drink menu. Some of the pastries and drinks will be customizable. For instance, the macaroons will have a surface on which you can paint designs~ \n\n Currency System\nWhile having goods on display in the town, residents of the town will be able to come by and purchase your goods and hang out in the caf\u00e9. This means you will gradually start making money. Things that you will be able to use money for include more furniture and decorations for your cafe, more toys for your animals, more available foods and drinks to make, and shopping around town! (Note: this is entirely optional!)\n In town will be multiple shops, including the potion shop. Autumn runs the potion shop at the top of the hill, in a giant moss terrarium. Give her a visit to get potions that can alter animals and the game around you! \n We wanted there to be no limits to how you could find happiness in Calico. Magic potions are a system that allow us to break the rules of what is possible and to find what would be most fun. \nHere\u2019s a taste of what\u2019s to come: the More-to-pet Potion allows the player to magically turn a single animal giant-sized! You can hang out with a giant animal, or even ride a giant cat! \nOr a red panda!\n\nAbout Funds\nOur goal with this Kickstarter is to raise enough money that both Andrew and Kells can work on the game full time for the next year and a half.

We're making an album to fix it.\nHi! We're the Doubleclicks: Aubrey Turner (she/her) and Laser Malena-Webber (they/them). We're a sibling musical duo from Portland, Oregon, who make indie folk music about love, science, and anxiety. We have a cello, we have a ukulele, we have a cat keyboard that goes meow meow meow. \nYou can listen to our our music on YouTube, Spotify, or Bandcamp for free! \n    We're known for making music on the Internet with you, other human beings. We also tour and play places like PAX, the JoCoCruise, SF Sketchfest, GenCon, and comics shops, game stores, and comedy clubs. We've released a handful of albums, three of them through the help of Kickstarter, and we want to do it again! Are you ready?  \nABOUT THE ALBUM: \n The time since our last album has been strange! For the first time since our inception, the Doubleclicks took a year-long break from performing and recording to live \"real lives.\" We even got day jobs for a minute there! Did you all know that there are entire groups of people in the world who live their lives OFF of the Internet? It's WILD. \n         Our break taught us a whole lot! One of the things we learned is that we are pretty bad at day jobs. And also, reality is pretty cool. And also, the Internet has ruined a lot of stuff. We learned that, then we came back together to write the longest, realest and funniest Doubleclicks album yet. We're also going to bring this big rad album on tour - even to Europe!\n         \"The Book Was Better\" is about a lot of things: gender, dogs, cats, anxiety, Halloween, and pizza are some of the things. But the big theme is this: We spend too much time yelling on the Internet, and we should all try something else. Certainly we can't stop using the Internet, that would be ridiculous. But just a tiny break sometimes, yeah \u2014 that's probably good. Go to a museum. Go roller skating and break your arm. Try to throw a birthday party and don't cancel it when you get overwhelmed at the very idea of human interaction. \nIt's a comedy album. \n         Tracklist:\n Clifford the Big Red Dog \u2014 body image and a dog\n Ode to a Summer Retail Job \u2014 a song about wet money \n Afterparty for One \u2014 an ode to frozen pizza \n Boundaries \u2014 a song about Laser's cat, Marzipan. She's perfect.\n Something I Can Hold \u2014 a song about the House on The Rock \n We're All Gonna Die \u2014 this one's a lot of fun!\n Happy Birthday, Nobody Hates You \u2014 a celebration for the anxious\n Nobody gets it \u2014 A Halloween song \n I'm Winning \u2014 a song about being genderqueer or maybe videogames\n Brand New Year \u2014 a song about the best-laid plans\n I Don't Wanna \u2014 no!\n The Ballad of Millie Rosa Jane \u2014 a sea shanty?\n Panic \u2014it's gonna be ok\n Check out this video for our new song \"I'm Winning\" \u2014 animated by a group of 16 incredible queer artists!  \nThis album is made with all ages in mind \u2014 there are no swears, but also it's not like, \"just for kids.\" It's the music we like, and it's a lot happier and funnier than the last record.\n  The Doubleclicks are a crowd-funded operation. With no major record label, we depend completely on our audience to help us make our art. The advantage of that - and this is huge - is that there is nothing between us and you. Our music goes straight from our hearts to your ears. We love it. It means so much to us to be able to make just the thing we want and just the thing you want, too. If you don't like it, we can't make it. So we do our very best.\n         We need your help to pay for recording and our studio rent, to produce CDs, merchandise, and promotional items for the album, to get the necessary software, instruments, and plug-ins, to master and mix the music, to submit the music to iTunes and other music stores, and to generally \"create something from nothing.\" \n         We thank you for supporting art and artists, and for making the world more beautiful! \nChart of project costs\n In exchange for your pledge, we have some rad stuff you can get. \nPINS!\nYou spoke and we listened \u2014 you love enamel pins, and you want one of our little featherless dinosaur friend. PLUS, we'll have a new badge-style pin from a VERY EXCITING ARTIST as well, the design will be released very soon! If you order a pin, you will be able to choose from these options!  \n\nSHIRT!\nThis new Doubleclicks t-shirt design will be available in \"unisex\" (S-4XL) and \"ladies\" cuts (S-4XL) and for the first time, this Doubleclicks shirt will also be available in youth sizes (XS-XL)!   \nShirt Design by Natalie Metzger\n \nREALITY BOX\nWhen you first open this box, you'll see a little pouch to put your phone in. Set it aside and start to enjoy this immersive \"real world\" experience. We bring you to a land... before constantly refreshing twitter and arguing on facebook and getting group texts and work emails 24/7. This is an entire (approximately 10\" x 8\" x 4\") box of activities, gifts and fun stuff that you can appreciate without your phone.\n         The box will include: the Doubleclicks-designed \"reality book\" of activities and puzzles (see below), a way to listen to a Doubleclicks song without any devices, and more! You'll be able to make something, solve some puzzles, play a game, learn a new skill, send a letter, and give a gift. There will be a rock, some string, and some exclusive Doubleclicks merch. We are extremely excited about this reward. \nREWARD NOTE: anyone who backs at the \"reality box\" level (or above) will get both enamel pins, a signed CD, and a shirt or tote. This isn't what it says in the reward level, and though we can't change the text of the reward level, it is TRUE. At the \"two boxes\" level, backers will get *two* shirts and two sets of both pins. \nREALITY BOOK\nLove reality, but hate boxes? This custom Doubleclicks \"field notes\"-style notebook will be chock-full of reality-based activities. Use this word search and find all of the neat, phone-free hobbies you could experiment with! Get some tips about crafting and photography! Read some aphorisms and affirmations! Play a game! Does the whole thing add up to a big puzzle? You bet it does! \n ADD-ONS\n  Don't see the combination of items you're looking for? Don't worry - you'll be able to buy \"add-ons.\" That means, after this Kickstarter ends, you can add extra CDs, t-shirts, books and pins to your order. If your level only includes one pin and you want to get the other one, you can! If your whole family needs t-shirts, you can get them! You don't need to do anything now in order to do that. The only thing that will not be available as an add-on is the D&D game. \n We have been blessed with a whole bunch people who help us every day to live our arty crowdfunded lifestyle. Thank you all so very very much. Some specific shout-outs: Thank you Mom and Dad for your support! Thank you Kim Newmoney for all these rad new band photos!

Perfectly scaled for roleplaying, the PVC miniatures come fully pre-assembled and ready to paint and play right out the box.\nCritical Role is a weekly livestreamed roleplaying game set in Exandria, which is the world created by veteran voice actor and Dungeon Master, Matthew Mercer. Each week, Matthew leads his friends (also fellow voice actors!) on epic adventures.  \nThe first Critical Role campaign centered on the ragtag group of heroes in Tal'Dorei known as Vox Machina \u2014 Pike Trickfoot, the Gnome Cleric, Keyleth, the Half-Elf Druid, Percival \u201cPercy\u201d Fredrickstein Von Musel Klossowski de Rolo, the Human Gunslinger, Grog Strongjaw, the Goliath Barbarian, Scanlan Shorthalt the Gnome Bard, Taryon \u201cTary\u201d Darrington, the Human Artificer, Vex\u2019ahlia (and her animal companion, a bear named Trinket), the Half-Elf Ranger and Vax\u2019ildan, the Half-Elf Rogue. The first campaign ended in November 2017 after 115 episodes and 373 hours of gameplay.\nCritical Role is now in its second campaign, in which the Mighty Nein begin their adventures together in Wildemount. The Mighty Nein consists of Yasha, the Aasimar Barbarian, Beauregard, the Human Monk, Mollymauk Tealeaf, the Tiefling Blood Hunter, Fjord, the Half-Orc Warlock, Nott the Brave, the Goblin Rogue, Jester, the Tiefling Cleric, and Caleb Widogast, the Human Wizard. Shak\u00e4ste, a human cleric, has proven himself to be a trusted ally of the Mighty Nein.\nVox Machina Party\nFrom Tal\u2019Dorei they hail. Whether cleansing the underdark of an aberrant scourge or preventing a would-be god from destroying the globe, this motley troupe of wayward souls - Keyleth, Vax'ildan, Vex\u2019ahlia (and Trinket!), Grog, Scanlan, Percy & Pike - are the greatest heroes the world of Exandria has ever seen.\nMighty Nein Party\nFjord, Beau, Caleb, Nott, Jester, Mollymauk, Yasha, and their ally Shak\u00e4ste... names that breed fear into the hearts of Wildemount\u2019s foulest foes. On a mission for fortune and glory, these fledgling adventurers may one day be the saviors of the Dwendalian Empire - if they can outrun the shadows of their storied pasts.\nCRITTERS PLEDGE $60/\u00a345\nWe anticipate that many of you looking at this Kickstarter are brand new to crowd-funding. Which means we took the decision to keep things as simple as we can. Historically most Kickstarter projects tend to charge a little bit more for the initial offering than they strictly need to and then \u2018bump\u2019 up the perceived value through stretch goals and other complicated ideas like that\u2026it can end up being very daunting to work out what pledge levels go with what and how much you need to commit etc. \nSo to avoid this confusion, for this Kickstarter we have simply given you one pledge level at an amazingly good price. This means that pledge level already includes all the Kickstarter exclusives and no Stretch Goals will be available during the campaign. What you see, is what you get...simple! \nHowever, the world of Exandria is a rich and detailed place with many wonderful characters worthy of making into miniatures. Rest assured, this is just the beginning of this journey for all of us...and don't forget, we're all ridiculously excited about this project and working hand in hand with CR over the coming years to bring the for world of Tal'dorei to your homes. And hey, who knows what random encounters might happen over the course of the KS campaign. \nSo just one question remains: How do you want to do this?\nCaleb Widogast and Frumpkin\nAfter investing heavily in our advanced miniatures development pipeline and working closely with carefully selected manufacturing partners, the quality and detail produced in our industry-leading miniatures is simply world-class. \nKickstarter Exclusive miniatures\nEvery highly-detailed mini is a fully pre-assembled PVC model, ready to paint and play straight out the box.\nShipping will be charged after the Kickstarter finishes based on actual costs incurred to ship and is collected via our pledge manager system. This allows us to charge fairly for all backers and avoid a 'one size fits all' mentality to shipping. \nWe will ship your pledges to several hubs around the world at our cost. Your pledge will arrive via one of the following hubs: \n\u2022 United Kingdom (UK and Rest of the World backers)\n\u2022 USA (US backers)\n\u2022 Canada (Canada backers)\n\u2022 Germany (EU backers)\n\u2022 China (Asia Pacific backers)\n\u2022 Australia (Australia and New Zealand backers) \nBelow are our initial rough estimates for shipping the sets (2kg volumetric weight).

Channel Islands, Highlands and NI \u00a36-\u00a313 \n\u2022 USA: \u00a37-\u00a311 to the contiguous US and the US Virgin Islands. \u00a317-20 to Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. \n\u2022 CANADA: \u00a37-\u00a315 to most cities. \n\u2022 EUROPE: \u00a38-\u00a320 to most countries. \u00a320-\u00a330 to non-EU countries. \n\u2022 LATIN AMERICA: \u00a325-\u00a340 to most countries. \n\u2022 ASIA: \u00a315-\u00a325 to most countries.\n\u2022 OCEANIA: \u00a39-\u00a318 to Australia and New Zealand. \n\u2022 AFRICA/OTHER: \u00a325-\u00a350 to most countries. \nAny pledges confirmed after our pledge manager deadline will be shipped from the UK hub at a later date and will likely incur increased shipping costs.\nBelow is the general schedule once the Kickstarter ends so you know when to expect money to be taken and our overall shipping plan. Again these are estimates: \nKickstarter Campaign Ends \n\u2022 0 Day \u2013 Pledges are charged. \n\u2022 1 Week \u2013 Survey sent confirming emails. \n\u2022 1-2 Months \u2013 Pledge Manager sent to backers taking payment for shipping. \n\u2022 1 Month Before Shipping \u2013 Pledge Manager deadline - any late confirmations after this deadline will be shipped from the UK after all other pledges are completed and may incur additional cost. \nShipping Starts \n\u2022 0 Days \u2013 China starts packing EU/AUS/US hub orders. UK/RoW orders are sent to the UK hub by sea freight. \n\u2022 2-5 Weeks \u2013 China begins packing and shipping Asian hub orders. \n\u2022 6-8 Weeks \u2013 UK hub receives items and begins packing and shipping to backers \n\u2022 9-12 Weeks - EU/AUS/US hubs receive items, ship everything out to backers within 2 weeks. \n\u2022 13+ Weeks \u2013 UK hub completes shipping of the UK and RoW orders.\nLate confirmation orders and customer service requests for missing/broken items are dealt with via support@steamforged.com.

You\u2019ll watch the attraction between them grow as you play out scenes, taking turns describing what your character says and does. Some of the things you\u2019ll want your character to do are going to increase that attraction\u2014and when that happens, you are going to pull a brick out from an increasingly shaky tower and place it on the top.\nSara Williamson and Joshua Yearsley hoping for one last moment together as two xenobotanists on an unknown planet.\nIf the tower falls, your characters act on their feelings! You decide what happens; the rules will tell you what that means. How many bricks you've pulled will help determine if your love is doomed, triumphant, or something in-between.\nOf course, that tower may never fall. If you make it through the final scene and the tower is still standing, the character never act on their feelings. Sometimes that's the right thing to do. \nStar Crossed takes about two hours to play. You'll need the rules, the cards, some character sheets and a couple pencils. And a tower of bricks, of course.\nEric Mersmann trying to contain his feelings for an undying creature of the night.\n\u201cThe stories are sweet, sad, and sexy as hell.

Don't tell Jesus!\nWhat is Dumbing of Age? It's a webcomic you can find on the Internet, and it's about freshmen entering college. It stars Joyce, a fundamentalist Christian who was previously homeschooled, and her unlikely new friend Dorothy, an atheist who wants to be President. They're surrounded by a varied cast of fully-realized characters, such as Billie, the alcoholic ex-cheerleader with a Resident Assistant problem(?), and Amber, the Internet shut-in who solves her rage issues by dressing up like a superhero and fighting crime. Oh, right, and Joyce's childhood best friend, that unflappable smartass Becky, is hiding out from her jerkbutt dad 'cuz she was caught smooching her roommate!\nRuth and Billie continue to be assholes in love.\nThis book would collect \"Year Six,\" spanning the four storylines that start on August 31, 2015 and complete on September 3, 2016. This includes new commentary, behind-the-scenes artwork, and new character designs into an 228-page tome with luxurious glossy paper all bound up into a sturdy presentation. Seriously, these books are gorgeous. Sometimes when we get solicitors I whip out a book to show them how pretty it is.\nAnd there will be a foreword by Jeph Jacques!  \nIn addition to the year of comics from the DumbingOfAge.com website, the book also includes 24 bonus comics that were originally created exclusively for the Dumbing of Age Patreon!  \nThere are also a few pages of bonus material including unused strips and alternate punchlines!\nTWENTY-FOUR strips not published previously on DumbingOfAge.com, like this one, are included!\nTo print 2000 copies of this first book at over $8 apiece, I'll need to raise approximately $17,000 to afford the printing costs. Add Kickstarter fees and taxes (oof) and the like, and that means I'll have to raise approximately $24,000 total. So that's the number on the board!\nFour years ago I did stretch goals to unlock website updates for Saturday and Sunday. Some of you thought updating 365 days a year would destroy me. Well, it did not!  IT ONLY MAKES ME STRONGER. And so let's keep that going. Stretch goals are in place to elongate those Saturday and Sunday updates for another year. Otherwise Saturday updates end on May 10 and Sunday updates end on May 30.\nIn Book 6, watch Amazi-Girl try to stop Becky's dad from kidnapping her! Seriously, it's a wild ride.\nMore about stretch goals: Last two years I did die-cut character magnets, and that was pretty popular! And so I'm gonna do more, right? Obviously. We're going to do them similarly to last time, as well, by unlocking some pledges for additional characters as we rise in pledges. Ultimately, we will unlock a magnet that everyone who orders physical goods will receive if we reach a certain point!\nA helpful illustration of what magnets look like on a refrigerator.\n So, at $50k, I will send 2\"x4\" Becky die-cut character magnets to everybody who ordered snail-mailable goods. If you ordered any number of real made-of-paper books, you'll get a Becky character magnet with your order! (Sorry, folks who pledge only for the PDF, but there are not envelopes for PDFs in which to put magnets!)\nBut in the meantime, we'll start off with some pledge tiers of character magnets that you can choose from! We got Jocelyne, we got Carla, and we've got both Jocelyne and Carla together! Plus, we have a pledge level where you'll get every single magnet unlocked by the end of this Kickstarter.  \nLet's list these stretch goals all list-like: \n$24K DOA BOOK 6 <--- FUNDED!\n$30K LESLIE AND ROBIN MAGNETS <--- FUNDED\n$34,569 RAPTOR ATTACK DINA MAGNET <--- And that's when the stretch goal comes. Not from the front, but from the side.\n$35K SATURDAY AND SUNDAY UPDATES CONTINUE <--- FUNDED!\n$40K DEXTER AND MONKEY MASTER MAGNETS <---FUNDED\n$44,446K FOOLS!  A GALASSO MAGNET APPEARS!\n$45K I WILL SHOW PLEDGERS A YET-TO-BE-PUBLISHED STRIP FROM...

For $100, $150, and $300, you can get a digital commission piece of artwork of one, two, or two characters totally making out, respectively! Each is at least 6\" long in some dimension, and will be sent to you in TIF and a smaller PNG form, the former of which you can get printed and framed if you like. Each one is unique, even if all of you ask for the same character! At the $300 makeouts commission pledge level, you also get one each of all the magnets unlocked by the end of the Kickstarter.\nLESLIE AND ROBIN MAGNET PLEDGE LEVELS UNLOCKED\n  RAPTOR ATTACK DINA MAGNET sudden dinosaur rampage\n  DEXTER AND MONKEY MASTER MAGNETS UNLOCKED\n  FOOLS!

I gotta get books produced and shipped from across the globe to me! And then I gotta personally mail over a thousand of these books and their rewards to you! And every year the number of you who pledge increases in size. That's both good and intimidating! But I'm pretty sure I can do it. This is my SEVENTH time! I am basically a machine at this by now.\n\nThe only wrinkle these days is my two baby kids! Despite them, I did manage to get all of my Book Five pledges mailed out in time last year, but I also had, like, months more time to do so. (The books arrived WAY earlier than I expected.) But, like, the kids still exist, so, um, who knows how they'll affect my speed in mailing out books and stuff this year. That's the only ongoing \"risk and challenge\" I can think of.

The print will be delivered with rewards from our campaign, around June or October of 2017 (depending on your reward tier).   \nAnnouncing our First Stretch GOAL: $28,000!

Our list of exciting creators includes Sally Jane Thompson (The Ruby Equation), Cecil Castellucci (Moving Target: A Princess Leia Adventure), Sarah Winifred Searles (Ruined), Irene Koh (Legend of Korra), Suzana Harcum & Owen White (Tripping Over You), and Julia Hutchinson; all of whom are creating FRESH stories about interracial and LGBTQ relationships.\nCheck out these intriguing stories!\nWalk It Off by Suzana Harcum and Owen White features Kat Drescher and Penny O'Neil who are eager to take their first holiday together after graduation, and counting on a grand romantic get-away to temporarily put off joining the real world and entering the workforce. They're not as prepared as they thought they were, however, when said holiday takes an unexpected turn\u2014 and the real world finds them first!\nWalk It Off - Fresh Romance Volume 2 will feature the first 60 pages of this three-part story that will continue in future volumes.\n One Lucky Bride by Julia Hutchinson is a retelling of Buster Keaton's 1925 silent film \"Seven Chances\" in which Sara, a young entrepreneur on the verge of bankruptcy, discovers she is heir to a distant relative's fortune. The catch? She has to get married by 7:00 PM to collect the inheritance!\nOne Lucky Bride - Fresh Romance Volume 2 will feature this 40 page story.\n  Under the Oak Trees by Sally Jane Thompson is a country mouse/city mouse romance that asks the question: Do different lives and different temperaments mean more pain than a relationship is worth?\nUnder the Oak Trees - Fresh Romance Volume 2 will feature the first 60 pages of this three-part story that will continue in future volumes.\nThe Only One by Cecil Castellucci, Sarah Winifred Searle, and Irene Koh is a tale of belated love that tells of a decades-spanning series of missed-connections that eventually lead to a cosmic love connection.\nThe Only One - Fresh Romance Volume 2 will feature this 10 page story.\nWith these talented creators on board, FRESH ROMANCE VOLUME 2 promises to delight and surprise! \nTell me more about VERONA!\nCover Art by Renae de Liz and Ray Dillon!\nWritten by director and screenwriter Emily Dell, VERONA is a story of violence, passion, and young love. Set in modern-day Verona, the Montoyas and Capulets are warring assassin clans, serving contracts for Henrys, Hamlets and MacBeths. When Jo Capulet and Roman Montoya are thrown together after a mission gone wrong, they see in each other a chance for a new life, even if it means destroying everyone in their path.\nThe gorgeous art was a collaboration between Mollie Helms and Bryndon Everett, with colors by Kennedy Cooke Garza and Eddie Jensen.\nVERONA is the first original graphic novel under the \"Fresh Romance Presents\" banner and stands at 160-pages. VERONA is currently being shipped to us for fulfillment. \nHow will you deliver my digital comics to me?\nFRESH ROMANCE is adopting a seasonal calendar and will be releasing digital single issues in the Spring and Summer.

You'll receive a code to download it directly from the emetcomics.com website on the day it comes out.   \nWondering what happened to the mysterious Fresh Romance Issue #8?

Purchased it already? Email us and we'll give you a free code to download it again! We want you to be happy!\nWondering why The Only One isn't included in the digital release schedule?

We are two sisters who make music on the Internet. We like dinosaurs, cats and self-esteem. One YouTube commenter said it best when she called us \"weird, charming, and heart-warming in a bizarre and yet adorable way.\" We tour all year, play at lots of conventions, host monthly online shows, release videos on YouTube through our Patreon campaign, and write songs. Many many songs. (Stream our last album for free!)\nWe've been on NPR, played a game on TableTop, had two of our albums chart on Billboard, and toured the US, Canada, and Australia! But don't take our word for it...\n\u201cIt\u2019s no secret, we love The Doubleclicks\u201d \u2013 i09 \n\u201cOur favorite nerdrocking cello heroes\u201d \u2013 BoingBoing \n\u201cEveryone with a heart should find something to love in the Doubleclicks\u201d \u2013 Portland Mercury \nOur music is influenced by the lyric-focused punk-infused music of They Might Be Giants, the honest rawness of the Dresden Dolls, and the DIY aesthetic of Kimya Dawson, with a dash of nerdy thrown in. Our goal is to represent a positive, empowering and feminist voice inside nerd and online communities... through song!\nNice to meet you! We are asking for your help to make a new album.\n  UPDATE: Our project has reached its initial goal, so now we are making bigger plans!\n   \"Love Problems\" is the 5th Doubleclicks album, and the most personal. The stories on this album come from a lot of places. From science news, from our tour last summer and our trips to many planetariums, from finally going back to therapy, from late nights with comedians, from high school mistakes, from the women who accidentally gave out my e-mail to her son's boy scout troop, and of course, ripped from today's headlines. The songs tell the story of trying to be strong when you don't feel strong, and finding an identity in your gender. The songs exist to make us, and you, feel better, and to help us all find the energy to make a difference.\nTracks will include:\nLord Of The Rings \u2014 \"There are songs I'll never listen to again, but you can't take all the things that make me the way I've always been.\"\nSensitive Badass \u2014 \"You have the strength and though all of the scars may last, you can be sensitive and still a badass.\" \nWomen Know Math \u2014 \"I am a woman, and I'm doing it right...no matter what I do.\" \nBig Bang \u2014 \"We've grown apart, but babe, since the Big Bang, so has everything.\"\nExtra Gin \u2014 \"I like comics and spaceships and cats, and I'm barely holding the panic in.\"\n(and at least six more)\nThe album will be produced by the Doubleclicks (like our last album, President Snakes), but we are scaling up by bringing in a few guests to help us with musical ideas and performance! \n$38,000: Pixel Art Video: UNLOCKED!\nAt $38,000, we're able to add an amazing animated video by James Brooks to this Kickstarter project! The song \"Big Bang\" is a song about a couple \"growing apart,\" just like the universe started growing apart after the Big Bang. The video will be about a relationship on a SPACESHIP! The concept is amazing, and the final version will look like this:\n$44,000 \u2014 Live Drums: UNLOCKED!\nWe'll add live drums! We have just received a final quote from an amazing drummer down in LA who has a rad style and his own studio, and is willing to add an wonderful, organic rhythm section to this album. I hope we can do it, because it will add some extremely great depth to these songs. More information in this update. \n$47,000 \u2014 You Should Write A Song About That: UNLOCKED\nWe have been developing a project called \"You Should Write A Song About That,\" in which a smart and entertaining person tells us about something that we should write a song about, and then we write a song about it! At this level, we will dedicate time to making 5 \"episodes\" of this show - including recorded interviews & songs released on the project's podcast feed. Guests will include authors, game developers, and science buffs. We use this project to write about important things which we need an outside perspective to help us express! More information coming in an update, of course!\n1,300 backers \u2014 New Sticker for all Sticker Backers! - UNLOCKED!\nIf we get 1,300 or more folks backing this project, even at $1 each, we will be able to add a 6th sticker to the currently 5-sticker pack! The design will be of a dinosaur! You can stick Doubleclicks stuff EVERYWHERE!\nsticker design by Natalie Metzger!\n$60,000 \u2014 President Snakes Video Musical - UNLOCKED!\nIf we get to this level we will produce the PRESIDENT SNAKES MUSICAL. President Snakes is a character we invented\u20145 snakes in a pantsuit, pretending to be a person, running for President. She and her campaign team\u2014optimistic campaign manager Danny and skeptical media guru Chanda\u2014face many obstacles, but they always believe, and they always persevere. \nWe have written a lot of this musical, both words and music, beyond the two songs that were on our last album. This musical will be 30 to 45 minutes in length. We'd love to finish it up and share it with you, and, if we hit this goal, we will do this by staging the musical in a relatively low-fi but very rad recorded \"youtube-style\" format. There will be actors, costumes, funny words, and great songs. We have a vision for this that is very adorable and exciting, and with your help, we can make it happen!\nAt 2,000 backers, we will also make a \"cast recording\" and distribute it as a digital EP to all the backers on this project!\nThe Doubleclicks are a crowd-funded operation. With no external label, agent, or manager, we depend completely on our audience to help us make our art. The advantage of that - and this is huge - is that there is nothing between us. Our music goes straight from our hearts to your ears. We love it. It means so much to us to be able to make just the thing we want and just the thing you want, too. \nWe need your help to pay our collaborators and our studio rent, to produce CDs, shirts, merchandise, and promotional items for the album, to get the necessary software, instruments, and plug-ins, to master and mix the music, to submit the music to iTunes and other music stores, and to generally \"create something from nothing.\"\nWe thank you for supporting art and artists, and for making the world more beautiful!\nThanks to input from some wonderful supporters and the collaboration of wonderful artists, this project has some wonderful rewards, including our first ENAMEL PINS, STICKER SETS, and some wonderful limited-edition CROSS STITCH ART.\nTHE ALBUM:\nDigital downloads of the album will delivered to Kickstarter backers a day or more before the rest of the world gets it. Most likely, the album will reach you via a download code to the website Bandcamp, where you can download the album in mp3, FLAC, wav, or a number of other nerdy formats. Physical CDs will come in eco-friendly packaging. \nENAMEL PINS:\nWe are very excited to be printing our first enamel pins! They will make an excellent addition to any cool nerd's lapel, jacket, bag, lanyard, or vest.\nAt any level where you get one enamel pin, you will be able to CHOOSE (in the survey after the Kickstarter) whether you want a \"Sensitive Badass\" pin or a \"Women Know Math\" pin. Some levels include both enamel pins.\n\"Women Know Math\" pins are designed by Marlowe Dobbe and measure 1.5\" wide. \"Sensitive Badass\" pins are designed by Meghan Murphy (@kawaiinot) and will be approximately 1.5\" tall\u2014measurement not final. \nSTICKERS:\nThe 5-piece Doubleclicks sticker set will include die-cut vinyl stickers suitable for affixing to your laptop, trapper keeper, or car bumper. Stickers will be on average 3\" square. The stickers will include the following designs: Cats, Dimetrodon, Tiny Paper Elephant, \"Sensitive Badass,\" and The Doubleclicks.\nThese will be created by a wonderful group of artists: Leigh Lahav, Natalie Metzger, Marlowe Dobbe, and Meghan Murphy.\nSHIRT/TOTE:\nWe will be commissioning a new, \"Love Problems\"-specific shirt and tote design from the incredible Natalie Metzger!\nShirts and totes will be hand-screen-printed here in Portland, Oregon. Shirts will be soft and comfortable, will be available in sizes Ladies Small-2XL (size chart) and Unisex Small-4XL (size chart). Don't like shirts? You can get the same design on a jumbo, sturdy eco-conscious tote bag! \nUSB DRIVE:\nDoubleclicks USB drives contain our up-until-now entire discography in both wav and mp3 form, as well as videos, live tracks, and a digital copy of our coloring book. The drive can also be emptied off and used as just a regular ol' 4 GB jump drive, which is pretty neat, too.\nUSB Drives can also be purchased by themselves anytime from our online store!\nHATS!:\nIncredible crafter and artist LeeAnne Minnick is creating 10 unique hand-made knit hats for this Kickstarter with a Doubleclicks-inspired \"Sensitive Badass\" design. Final hats will be made of Merino Wool in a purple and white design. This says \"I'm sensitive, I'm a badass, and my head is warm!\"\nHat mock-up: final yarn will be \"woolier\" and hat pattern may change slightly\nCROSS STITCH ART:\nWomen Know Math artist Alyshondra Stay Meacham is creating a limited run of 10 Doubleclicks-inspired cross stitch pieces. If you back at this level, you can choose from the following four lyrics: \"I love you like a burrito,\" \"You're not a quitter,\" \"Sensitive Badass,\" and \"Rawr, Velociraptor.\" \nEach piece of art will be hand-stitched, will measure 5\"x7,\" and will be framed. \nConcept art\nRINGTONES:\nThe Doubleclicks will record a small batch of custom ringtone songs for backers at this level! You will be given a survey which asks you to pick what you want the ringtone for (the phone is ringing / it's time to wake up / my food timer went off / I need motivation ) and what your name is, and we will record custom lyrics for you over our 20-second exclusive-to-this-project ringtone track! Will the ringtone track have cat keyboard? OF COURSE IT WILL!\nThe Cat Cube!\nAll-star Doubleclicks fan and crafter extraordinaire Lauren, aka @flailsquared, has designed an exclusive Doubleclicks-themed Cat Cube! What is a Cat Cube, you ask? It's this!\nIt's a cat bed, for cats!\nThe Doubleclicks cat cube has a special \"Love You Like A Burrito\"-themed design! The cube measures 17\" on all sides and is made from Blizzard fleece and 1\" hypoallergenic, pet rated HD36-R foam. It's a perfect love-filled room for your cat or other animal.\nInside the cube says \"I love you like a burrito!\"\nThe Very Special Box:\nThis is a new reward and we are VERY excited about it. We are going to fill a cardboard box with some special gifts just for you, based on the things we like to do. \nAngela likes painting (and she's not terrible.) She'll paint you a simple, colorful, beautiful cartoony, unique acrylic painting on a small square canvas. If you have a specific thing you want a picture of, get in touch on Twitter or in a Kickstarter message and she'll tell you whether she can make that happen.\nAngela's paintings look like this. She will paint you a picture of one thing.\nAubrey loves stickers. She's in a sticker club. She will write you an inspirational note and cover it with stickers. \nAubrey's sticker cards make a great point.\nWe have a lot of dinosaurs, and they need homes. We will give you one of our dinosaur figures, and also give it a name and a personality so you know how to take care of it.\nBecause you care, we will send you a postcard from the studio telling you how the day is going, good or bad.\nPlus, you'll be thanked in the album's liner notes for being such a big supporter!\nWe anticipate a couple of questions about this project.\n1. WHAT ABOUT THE CHILDREN? We know we have lots of wonderful family and children supporters, and the themes on this album, though universal, aren't as kid-accessible as dinosaurs and meow sounds. Please know that we love you and we will continue making more kid-friendly music - this project is just the one that came first. The album MAY have a couple swear words on it (it will definitely have the word 'badass'). \n2. WHEN DID YOU GET POLITICAL? STICK TO THE MUSIC, GIRLS! (Yes, people say this to us). We were never \"not political,\" you were just better at selective listening. Please continue selectively listening and give us your money, or go away. We are not going to stop talking about our feelings and what we think is right. That's the whole darn point. And\u2014by the way\u2014silence is political, too. Silence is a statement of approval of establishment behavior. No, thank you. \n3. HOW ARE YOU DOING? Thank you for asking. We're doing ok. It can feel pretty hopeless right now, but we are not going to stop making art. I (Angela) actually wrote a little essay about \"making art when things seem hopeless,\" and that made me feel a little bit better.\nWe have some people to thank for this project already: Thank you to our Patreon supporters, who have sponsored our music videos and our shows as we have been writing the songs for this album over the last two years! Thank you to the 50 artists who illustrated our \"Women Know Math\" video! Thank you to our friends Max Temkin, Christopher Badell, and Mike Selinker who gave us valuable feedback on this project, and Elisabeth Allie and Melissa Harris who helped us spread the word. Thank you to Eli McDonald for creating our header artwork, and Jessie Kirk for taking the header photo. Thank you to our families for their support as we stress out about this, to Rich Malena, Justin Turner, Susan Webber, Stephen Webber, and all of you.

She dreams of breaking out of suburbia and her artistic rut, but she has a lot of self-discovery to do before that happens. The comic follows her funny misadventures as she learns that maybe these (sometimes) friendly felines are just what she needs to get her life on track.\nWe've been posting Finding Molly as a free webcomic since January, and the response has been overwhelmingly positive. We're stunned by how much our readers love Molly and her gang of cats and artists, and we're ready to take the next step and print the entire book!\nWant to read the comic before you buy? Head over to our Tumblr and see what you think!\nWho made the comic?\nJustine Prado (writer): Justine is a Los Angeles-based feature and television screenwriter, playwright, activist, and cat lady.

I've completed many other comics in that time, like my autobiography with time travel, We Can Fix It, and several stories for the critically acclaimed Smut Peddler erotic comics anthology. Chester holds a very special place in my heart, which is why I think it deserves to be collected in the best book possible. The first Chester 5000 book was published by Top Shelf and they did a gorgeous job. I want the second book to be just as great, maybe even better, that's why I've come to Kickstarter and to you!\nThe first volume told the story of Pricilla, a Victorian woman with needs, who falls in love with Chester, a robot made by her husband, Robert. It's a romance with sci fi elements about empowering women's desire. The book was critically acclaimed and pages from it have been featured at the Museum of Sex in NYC.\nThe second chapter of Chester, Isabelle and George, continues the adventure and explores the character's first meetings. It follows Isabelle, a lonely orphan, reprimanded at every turn by her strict matron, and George, a promising inventor on the cusp of a brilliant invention. It's a romance with dramatic twists about secret desire, industrial corruption, and the oppressive social prisons that get in the way of love.\nThe book will be hard cover, 175 pages. We've also got some great rewards like sexy ebooks, tote bags, stickers, and enamel pins. I'm working with the lovely, experienced people at Make That Thing for this campaign, so they'll handle order and reward fulfillment.\nLet's make this book the best it can be.

Inspired by some of our favorite films, this world began to grow; becoming populated, and developing a rich history. It began to burst with stories to tell. So, here we are, setting out to tell one. We are shooting for a 30-40 minute film.\nWHAT ARE YOU DOING NOW?   \nWhile we're waiting on our fundraising our whole team is hard at work creating props, weapons, and costumes. As well as starting construction on the speeder and robot with materials we already have.

Electronics for our robot character, a higher quality camera, lighting equipment, along with things like food and gas during our production weeks. \n WHAT ARE YOUR STRETCH GOALS?\nIf we reach our stretch goal of $15,000 we will be able to afford more film festival entries, and purchase even better equipment.

The planned ship date is in November, perfect timing to give it as a Christmas gift!\nWoo Hoo, a new BONUS AWARD! Click here to listen to some of the songs that are part of this album!\nA brand new pledge level! Includes a hard cover copy of The Great Cheese Squeeze children's picture book! See more about the book HERE.\nGet a second copy: Folks have been asking for an easy way to get an extra copy of the book. Just add $35 to any pledge level and you'll get an additional copy of the book!\nYay! Now all pledges $35 and above will get a digital copy of the super fun picture book I did with Keith Lango, The Great Cheese Squeeze! The ibook version even has wonderful narration by Elizabeth Smith. Tell all your friends and pets!\nNow check out these awesome rewards!\nI've always loved SCRATCH AND SNIFF, and Animal Gas is the PERFECT subject matter for this. Each character in Animal Gas has his or her own disSTINK personality and they try an convince each other that their toots smell great. There are lots of delightful smells in the book along with some really funny bad smells.\nAnimal Gas is also a great book for reluctant readers. The funny smells and the silly rhyming verses will have both children and adults giggling as they read and sniff. I previewed Animal Gas to a large local elementary school here in Indiana and both the kids and the teachers were roaring with laughter.\nSelf publishing a picture book is not cheap to begin with, but it's even more expensive for SCRATCH AND SNIFF books. But I've found a company that specializes in scented printing and they do incredible work. I really think it's worth it. Their Rub4Scent technology is of a very high quality.\nPrinting a hardcover scratch and sniff book costs 2-3 times as much as printing a softcover non-scratch and sniff book. But I feel that the cost is worth it. I designed the book to work with scented printing and scratch and sniff smells bring a whole new level of experience and unique interactivity and fun to the book.\nIn order to bring the cost of the book down to a more affordable level I have to have a minimum of 750 copies made. If I exceed my fundraising goal, I will be able to order even more copies and bring the cost per book down. And then I'll be able to offer some awesome bonus rewards too!\nIn addition to the hardcover SCRATCH AND SNIFF version I'm also creating a super fun ibook and epub version which will feature realistic sound effects and narration. Development costs for this adds to the amount I need to raise too, but again, I've designed the book for this format as well and it's just begging for sound!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nBecause I'm offering the book in several different formats, making sure that I can get them all done will be a priority. Fortunately I have all the art finished for the book and will just need to get it to the printer. I have identified the printing company that I will be working with as well. \n\nI have also been illustrating books for a living for a long time, so I have a lot of experience preparing digital illustration files for print, etc. \n\nI have most of the assets for the ibook version finished, and I've built ibooks in the past, so I'm very excited to make that as well.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #31", "update_userinfo": "HUGE Post Valentines Animal Gas Sale!", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #30", "update_userinfo": "Animal Gas Reviews", "update_content": "Animal Gas is now up on Amazon and Goodreads!

Formed from a grass roots movement of folks living communally and pouring into a small town with a very dark history, we respond by making music that is about hope and community. \nIn the last three years we\u2019ve been able to record and release 3 albums, ALL are available for FREE download via BandCamp. Besides playing at some awesome venues in the Midwest, J & the D continues to perform live for non-for-profit organizations, charity fundraisers, and inmates incarcerated in state penitentiaries. We are about to take on our biggest recording adventure yet, and need YOUR HELP! Projects description: This album will look at isolation vs. relationship and youth vs. adulthood. Can we wander our journey together? Is it na\u00efve to hope that young love can remain young even when we grow older? These are a few of the questions these new songs wrestle with. What can you expect of the sound? We hope it will be compared to My Morning Jacket, Band of Horses, or Lord Huron. For you ol\u2019 timers though we will accept The Beatles\u2026this time. \nThe money you donate is going entirely to the album. The largest portion is in Production costs, i.e. the Recording, Mixing, and Mastering of 10 songs, and then about 23% is left for Promotion, this cost includes the vinyl and cd pressing. None of this money is going into our pockets. If we raise more than our goal is set at we will use it to pour further into this album and will make a statement via our website as to what the overflow funds went to. Our goal is to be as transparent as possible.\nTo learn more about J & the D, please visit our website at: www.jamesandthedrifters.com\nThe Handmade Cigar Box-\nThe Vinyl- \nThe Tee- ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nA couple of the risks and challenges for this project is the time and ability to get it all done in the 5 days we are scheduled to record. That's right, 5 days! We are hitting the studio Friday evening to meet with Peter Fox and begin pre-production, then Saturday to Wednesday we will be hitting it hard. Some songs will need to be recorded live which presents another challenge. For anyone that has done any live recording you are familiar with the difficulties of being able to hear the necessary components to perform well (not messing up, but mistakes are real and sometimes genius) and not getting a lot of bleed from the other instruments performing. \n\nHopefully the mic placements will eliminate most of the bleed and will be ironed out in pre-production. If we run out of time in the 5 days to get all 10 songs recorded we will then have to set up a couple more weekends with Peter to wrap it up which means driving back up to Michigan and may also mean taking more time off work. \n\nWe can't do this project without all of you - if we fall short of our goal, we won't receive any of the pledged money (everyone gets refunds) - so thank you thank you thank you! Please send this page along to anyone who has ever listened to, loved or made music and everyone who believes in the power of hope to bring change.

We'll also be using many of the same animation, modelling, sculpting, set building and clay & puppet fabrication methods we've used before\u2014keeping the overall game design scalable so that we can create a fun and exciting experience within our targeted funding goal, but still have the flexibility to expand, should the opportunity present itself.\nOf course, none of this happens without your support, which is why we are reaching out to you through Kickstarter. Why Kickstarter? Funny you should ask...\nKickstarter is our most direct link to you, the fans. This is your opportunity to express whether or not you'd like to see another clay and puppet, stop-motion adventure game. Armikrog is a unique and creative project that we would love to make for those of you who have, over the years, dreamed of the chance to immerse yourself in another world made of clay. We're here to offer you the opportunity to make this project a reality.\nWhile our funding goal is considerably less than The Neverhood cost to produce in 1997, it is still our biggest hurdle. But in light of what it will cost to create, the real question is this: Would you support and play this game for $25?\nIf enough of you support it, you will get this game.\nThe Armikrog game will be comparable in size and scope to The Neverhood. It's been noted that our initial funding goal is significantly less than the cost of the original Neverhood game--this is possible since we are now utilizing technology that was not available to us 15 years ago (Unity engine, post-production and editing software, etc) which will allow us to create this game more efficiently with a overall higher level of quality.\nIn addition to our more conventional game production pipeline, we are also utilizing many of the same stop motion techniques used in such feature films as Paranorman and Nightmare Before Christmas. A significant portion of our budget is allocated toward puppet fabrication and sculpting, set building, lights, cameras, and lots and lots of clay!\nStop motion animation is an art all of its own. Each puppet, set and prop is individually hand-crafted by artists, while each and every frame is painstakingly animated. This specialized process is what makes this game unique--and we feel the time and talent that it takes to bring a project like this to this to life is worth every penny.\n100% of the funds that are raised will go directly into the production of the game. To date, we\u2019ve invested over $100,000 into the preproduction, design, and development, and we can see how fun and amazing this project will be. We want to deliver an incredible experience to all of you who support us, and applying 100% of your contributions toward development is the only way this will happen.\nIllustration by Earthworm Jim poster artist, Mike Koelsch\nRewards fall into two basic categories: Digital Rewards that are distributed though Steam and/or comparable download venues, and Physical Rewards that will be distributed through the mail. Note that all physical rewards under $1000 have an additional shipping cost for supporters with addresses outside of the United States.\nRewards that are not dependent on the production of the actual game will be fulfilled before the date specified in the reward tiers. Since we can't predict the amount of rewards that will need to be fulfilled, all rewards have been given the same fulfillment date as the game's ship date (July 2014). Once the campaign has ended, we will notify you of the fulfillment dates for those rewards that will ship sooner.\nBoxed Edition in the big, old-school size (mockup - design not finalized)\nKickstarter Exclusive Armikrog T-Shirt ($200 tier and above)\nTommynaut stop-motion production puppet\nDigital Rewards\nPhysical Rewards\nArmikrog is already getting a lot of great press.

Having many of the original members of The Neverhood team is a tremendous asset, as we already have the experience of creating this type of game. All games face unforeseen challenges throughout the course of production, but we have yet to face a challenge that we couldn't overcome. We have already begun to detail the entire scope of the game before production begins, which will help to define and minimize risks--which is key to the successful development of any game.\n\nWe've already invested a substantial amount of time and money into preproduction, laying the groundwork for an amazing game and we hope that you are as excited as we are about this project.

So what do you think? Can a 3D printed product get into retail stores? \nI believe the answer is yes but first let me tell you about this cool product and then my plan to get there. You're probably familiar with those wooden unisex dolls in craft stores for artists, right?  You know, the ones with those funny looking ball joints? Well, haven't you wished they made them with the proper proportions and range of motion? Yes? Well so did I, and that's what I set off to do. \nAfter many months of design, 3D printing and iteration, and a thorough four month beta phase with over 800 armature shipped around the world. I've finally come up with a design that has been tested and proven and a production and shipping pipeline well established.\nThis figure, has been designed to simply and accurately portray the human anatomical proportion with a range of motion capable of posing it realistically. Unlike the wooden dolls that are currently out in the market, these, are way more accurate and are better suited to meet the needs of artists and, in fact, has already had positive impacts on my own art.\nThrough this kickstarter I'm releasing the new, 2013 version of the design and also a number of new products and enhancements such as quadrupeds, a 1-1 hand armature, various proportional and anatomical variations and more!\nSo why help me out? The thing is, I've been manufacturing these myself with 3D printers and as you can imagine, it's painfully slow. Right now I can produce about 10 of the large armatures a day, which does not including assembly or possible failure-rate (there's good days and bad days).  Consequently, there's little to no hope of getting it into retail storefronts, as they need to be assured they can order 100-200 on a moment's notice.\nGetting this product into retail stores is the only way this armatures will get the exposure it really needs in order to thrive and become the livelihood I need it to be in order to put food on the table.   If I make my goal, I can raise enough money to expand my equipment and include ten (10) 3D printers, With these I'd be able to produce 50 armatures a day! This kind of output will allow me to meet the initial needs of retail stores in addition to online orders.\nIn exchange for your support, I'm offering many of these armatures at a 25% discount (even over %50 if you get the $200 bundle) and even offering some armatures that will never be available through retail OR my website (such as the 5.5\" armature). Meeting this kickstarter goal will allow me to add the additional printers to my arsenal and pay for the materials and shipment of the rewards you pledge on. My time would be unpaid and would constitute my contribution to the campaign. I'll be handling all the printing, assembly, shipping and the package design for retailers.\nPlease support my grassroots attempt to manufacture this product. Even if you're not an artist, any of these rewards would make a great gift for any artist friends you have.\nSpecial Note:\nOnly those that contribute to this campaign will get their armatures in this limited edition color (pearl & crimson). If you prefer the default brown with dark trim, you can opt out of this choice by saying so in the comments (but you can't back out after you do). The pearl color, uses little to no pigmentation and so it is slightly translucent (similar to skin & marble, so it will provide you with more realistic shading when doing your value samples)\nTo learn more about how to use these armatures for illustration, watch the video listed at the top.\nCredits: \nMusic by Mariya Lincoln & DjembeDJ\nFilmed by Kevin Harris\nNote: I Photoshoped away the background because it had a nasty texture to it", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI launched a crowd-funding campaign to release a Beta version of this product late last year with over 800 armatures ordered: (http://www.indiegogo.com/armature9)\n\nI was very thorough and transparent with my fulfillment of orders by providing this public spreadsheet to all contributors so they could track my progress:\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0ArJsKv5h1IsCdFJCN2QyUUh5N1lselJCWURwVjQxQ1E&usp=sharing\n\n\nAnd I learned a TON! I faced a number of unexpected issues and learned how to resolve them. As a consequence, I established a sustainable and efficient production and assembly pipeline. Am in the process of solidifying a relationship with a filament supplier. Found an excellent technician to help me with repair issues. Resolved a number of design problems based on feedback I got from customers. Registered with a bulk mailing service and learned how to assemble and package the armatures efficiently. I learned an incredible amount about manufacturing with 3D printers in general and how to get consistent repeatable and non-brittle results. \n\nIn short, I've really crossed my t's and dotted my i's so that I could launch this much larger campaign. So I see very little risk to you, the contributor. I'm sure, however, I will continue to learn new things, once, and if, you help me get my foot in the door of retailers.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #60", "update_userinfo": "Important: Last Update for Armature Nine", "update_content": "Happy new year everyone!

Quite a lot, I guess, but we think one of those things is an interesting premise for a horror adventure.\nThe game is heavily based on atmosphere and exploration, and using the two year old child\u2019s perspective. For example you\u2019ll be able to see your own body at all times, and you will have to interact with the environment to find places to hide from dangers.\nOur gameplay prototype from last summer:\nFresh environment teaser:\nThe teasers we have published are captured entirely in-game.\nThere might be threats hiding in every shadow, but there\u2019s no traditional combat.

We aim to include the surrealistic theme of dreams and children's imagination, both as a setting and an active part of the game.\nMore concept art \u00bb\nWhile travelling through diverse environments inspired by our dreams and driven by the endless imagination of the child, you will have to search for comfort and safety.

As a creative collective of friends, we started our current project Among the Sleep as our thesis project, and we decided to continue working on it after graduating.\nWe love this medium, and want to craft unique and interesting experiences to drive it forward. This means that we experiment all the time, for instance by making and releasing creative side projects for free.\nWe're now at the point in development where we have finished the core gameplay, but there is still a lot of production, as well as a ton of polishing and testing left to do. We want to take our time and make the game as good as possible.\nThe only obstacle we see going forward, is that everyone at Krillbite still work part time jobs on the side to survive while developing Among The Sleep. This inhibits our focus and productivity on the game, and we don\u2019t want to lower our expectations to the quality of the finished game, or delay the release. We hope this Kickstarter will help us deliver the best possible experience we can, within a reasonable timeframe. Another reason to use Kickstarter is our wish to stay independent, and free from the creative boundaries of a publisher.\nWe've found that $200.000 is the amount we need to quit our part-time jobs, and continue working all hours of the day on finishing Among the Sleep.\nIf we are fortunate enough to receive more than our goal, what would we spend it on?\nWe are very satisfied with the existing design of Among the Sleep, but there are numerous things that we\u2018d like to be able to offer you on the side of the game itself.\nLike we mentioned in the Oculus Update Video, we\u2019ll be including a basic implementation either way, but we\u2019d really like to spend some time optimizing and exploring some amazing possibilities with the technology.\nWe\u2019d also very much like to include a proper in-game Commentary Track, so that you can hear our thoughts, anecdotes and other stories from the development of Among the Sleep should you choose.\nYou'll find a ton of rewards to your right, including copies of the game, OST, Boxed limited edition, Art book, T-shirts, Alpha testing, your name in the credits a Skype conference with the team and a Personal plush-Teddy, handmade by us at Krillbite!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAt the moment, our biggest challenge is that all of us work part time jobs to finance Among the Sleep.

There might be a few other elements in the final product but the bulk of the game would be just walking through a graveyard, reading epitaphs and thinking about who these people were and never will be again.\nUpdate May 07: Wooo! We have achieved our goal of 5,000 dollars. Surprisingly quickly too, after only ten days. Thanks very much to everyone who has supported us and will continue to support us and this project. It could not happen without you.\nIf you wish to see the reasons why you should keep giving us money scroll down to the 'stretch goals' sections below. Or you can just give us more money because you like us. We like you.\nUpdate May 17: We've met our first stretch goal at 7,500 dollars. This is great! I hope everyone tells all their friends so we can reach the next one. You are all great.\nUpdate May 24: We've met our second stretch goal at 10,000 dollars. So we'll be making the game cross platform for the Mac, PC, Android and iOS, hopefully Linux as well but we can't guarantee that.\nGameplay\nIt might be hard to imagine why someone would want to play a game about walking through a graveyard. Have you ever done that? Just walked through a graveyard and spent time examining all the different gravestones and what's written there? You should if you haven't.\nThe gameplay is simple: you move around and examine things. The most obvious things being the headstones, of course. You can also interact with any NPCs you might encounter.\nFree Roaming\nThe game itself has no win scenario. As the protagonist you'll start with a specific gravestone you're looking for, but finding it won't end the game. Looking at every gravestone once won't end the game. Doing everything there possibly is to do won't end the game. The game ends when you decide to leave the graveyard. The experience is yours. It isn't dictated by some preset guidelines.\nThere will be some specific event triggers, yes, but they don't need to be triggered. Maybe today you don't want to talk to anyone, you just want to leave flowers on a gravestone and sit for awhile.\n\nNo Danger\nThe game has no lose scenario either. There is nothing threatening the player. No zombies bursting up from the graves and no vampires hidden deep in the mausoleums. The gravedigger is not digging a grave for you and it's impossible to be buried alive. There's nothing to be afraid of at Boon Hill, except perhaps your own mortality, despite what some NPCs might tell you.\nThough they do say you should never fall asleep in a graveyard.\nDiscover Mystery in the Graveyard\nI don't want to imply the game is aimless. Boon Hill is about inferred stories, about the connections people have that continue even after they die. The graveyard tells many tales woven by those who've long since passed on: stories of love, life, sorrow, and joy, told over generations.\n\nThe threads of narrative are woven throughout the gravestones for you to discover, if you have the inkling to look. A row of graves all with the same last name, most of them having died very young, suggests a specific set of circumstances. An epitaph that reads 'Survived by no one' is dour, yes, but clearly someone carried out their last wishes. Here, people are tied together by something as simple as similar birth dates, the places they were born or died, and even the styles of their grave markers. Subtle stories abound in the rows of stone.\nGame Elements and Specifications\nCurrently the game will be released for the PC platform only. Why? Because cross-platform development takes more time and thus costs more money.\nThe graphics will be, as shown in the demo images on this page, pixel art. Why? Because I'm a pixel artist and I have friends who are pixel artists and art is expensive. Also, on a more subjective note, I like pixel art (thus why I'm a pixel artist). I think it helps create a symbolic world that isn't weighed down by photorealism.\nThe music and sound design will be simple but hopefully immersive. A very talented musician wants to work on the project, and there would always be the option to turn his very talented music off if you'd prefer your graveyard experience silent.\nOne thousand grave markers are currently planned, each with its own implied backstory. Why not more? Mainly because someone (primarily myself) has to write each and every one of those.\nSpecifics:\nFancy, advanced 16-bit graphics! The kind of graphics you drooled over twenty years ago.\nThe ability to choose your gender as male OR female! How very progressive.\nOne thousand individual graves and epitaphs for you to read! It's the whole point of the game, after all.\nSeveral NPCs to interact with! At least more than two. Talk to them, learn their stories.\nA map system! So you will know where you are. Getting lost is frustrating.\nVirtual graveyard! Real depression! Feelings of depression are not guaranteed, but reading epitaphs is not known as a heartwarming pastime.\nThe ability to sit! You'll be able to sit next to graves.\nReal-time mourning! You'll be able to bow your head, leave flowers on gravestones, and look sad. All in real time!\nFigure out what's up with that weird goth chick! She's kinda creepy.\nLie in an open grave! Haven't you always wanted to do that?\nBut mostly, Learn about the history of this town and the kind of people that lived their through the legacy they have left behind in the graveyard boon hill.\n5,000 dollars\nWhen I see a Kickstarter I always want to know exactly what they plan to spend money on, how far along in the project they are at the start, all those sort of things. Thus, for your perusal, here's an itemized list of what our funding would be used for.\nAll of these estimates were gathered from people I trust, or who are actually working on the project currently for free, and most of them were averaged out from a few sources.\n500-800 dollars - Sound design\n2,000-5,000 dollars - Programming\n1,500- 3,000 dollars - Pixel art\n500 - 800 dollars - Writing\nTotal Production cost: 4,500-9,600\nAs you can see, the lowest estimate from every element of the project sums to 4,500. That would leave, after everyone was paid for their work (and underpaid at that), only 500 dollars, which would cover the cut to Amazon and Kickstarter, leaving basically nothing for things like distribution and any kind of marketing. Everything else would need to come out of pocket.\n5,000 dollars is asking for just 1,000 people to pre-order the game at 5 dollars each. That seems like a realistic goal for this strange quirky game, and one I'm excited to try and meet.\nGetting the Game, Running the Game\nCurrently the game is only planned for the PC.  The donation of five dollars or more will guarantee you a digital copy of the game. No physical copies of the game are planned because that costs money. Of course, after the game is made more copies will be available for purchase through online distribution.\nThe system requirements are all up in the air but the game won't be graphically intensive, shouldn't be overly large, and thus should run on all modern PC systems.\nStretch Goals?\nUpdate May 07: Originally we were just focused on getting the bare minimum funding to get the project completed, but as we've managed to get that amount, we wanted to show some of the other features we would love to have the money and time to make.\nSo here they are, the Boon Hill stretch goals.\n$7,500 Reached! -More NPCs and Random Elements. Encounters that aren't static, such as people coming and going from the graveyard. Giving it a more 'living' feel. - We've met this goal and so this will be part of the game.\n$10,000 REACHED! - Part of this one has already been mentioned, making the game cross platform, for PC, Mac, iOS and Android. This hasn't changed. On top of that we'd be adding a 'double' soundtrack. There will be one soundtrack along the lines of the music in the kickstarter video and another rooted in chiptunes. You'd be able to switch between them (or turn the music off) based on your preference. - We've met this goal and so we will release the game cross platform.\n$12,500 - A more fleshed out graveyard with a greater variety of gravestones and other areas such as a pet cemetery. We'd have the resources to really flesh out the world of Boon Hill.\n$15,000 - Improved graphics for the menus and such, as well as a super cool animated intro of the sun rising over the graveyard in pixelated splendor. Other graphical improvements.\n$20,000 - The team would be paid what they are actually worth for their time and efforts. On top of us making a living wage? A character editor. Instead of simply the generic male or female protagonist, you would be able to design your own from different elements to make your avatar feel unique.\nAnything beyond 20K is insanity and can not even be considered right now.\nAll of these are of course subject to change as the project moves forward and people voice their opinions. New goals may be added or edited at any time.\nThank You Kindly\nEven just taking the time to look through this Kickstarter proposal is helpful. If you're interested in the game being made but don't have the money to donate, consider just showing it to a friend.\nThe website for the game is at: www.14hoursproductions.com\nE-mails can be directed at: Boonhill@14hoursproductions.com\nFollow us on twitter @TheBoonHill to receive a daily epitaph.\nA thanks to everyone who has supported the game so far, and everyone who will support it in the future. Dreams die when we do, not before.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nSo we get the 5,000 dollars. What then?\n\nWe make the game. That is guaranteed. Whatever happens, if the 5,000 dollar goal is met the game will be released. All donation pledge gifts will be honored. The current goal is for the game to be done completely and sent to everyone within three months of the Kickstarter closing. If all goes well, everyone should have everything by or before the end of August.\n\nProblems might arise, as they often do. Many of the people working on Boon Hill are doing it as favors, and even with the 5,000 dollars won't exactly be able to quit their day jobs. While not ideal, delays in the final product are possible. However, even if I have to pay another five grand out of pocket to make sure it gets finished, it will. I love ramen.\n\nAnother possible issue is that a lot of the pledge rewards involve communication between the pledger and the team. With this in mind we'll make sure to have lots of forms of communication open, and want anyone that pledges to do the same. Please ensure the e-mails you present us with are valid, and are not carting things off to your spam folder.\n\nWe would potentially release a whole updated version of the game to everyone for free to fix any issues or mistypes with people's pledge rewards. We want you to be happy with them.\n\nIf you're actually excited to play the game, we're excited to make sure you get the game.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #81", "update_userinfo": "Welcome to Boon Hill up for a Steam Award!", "update_content": "Good morning those that still live under the sun,\nI hope all you Americans out there had a nice thanksgiving and all you who aren't American I hope you had a nice uh... week.\nWelcome to Boon Hill has been nominated for the coveted steam award \"Best Graveyard Simulator\".

We've always wanted to make the process of editing your campaign pages much more organic and natural, and now we have the chance. Watch the video for a quick demo of what we mean by \"natural editing\"\nThere are some significant technical challenges here, which is why the stretch goal is so aggressive. I still think we can hit it, especially as we approach the final push that most Kickstarters get.\nAs with the other stretch goals, this will be a post-reforging target. My best estimate right now is that we can launch this sometime in December of 2013. I wish I could promise it sooner, but this gets to the very core of Obsidian Portal and I don't want to under-emphasize the difficulty.\nMega Stretch Goal - Extra Month at $75,000\nFor every $10k we raise over the initial goal, we will be able to extend the premium Ascendant time for every backer (Hasted Ascendant and above) by 1 month. We've already achieved 6 extra months! So get out there and tell your friends. The more backers we bring in, the more Ascendant time everyone gets!\nShe can't take much more, captain!\nUpdate - Additional Years Available\nBy popular demand, we're offering additional years as an add-on purchase. Simply pledge an additional $35 on top of your chosen backer level for each additional year you want. More details and examples down below the backer levels.\nStretch Goal #4 - Custom Campaign URLs - $50,000 - ACHIEVED\nPart of the reforging is an overhaul to make things look better, so we think everyone would like to make their page URLs look nicer as well. Every campaign will get its own subdomain (ie. \u201cmycampaign.obsidianportal.com\u201d) and Ascendant campaigns can set up their own raw domain (ie. \u201cmycampaign.com\u201d).\nThere will be significant technical challenges with this stretch goal, both in making sure that old URLs do not break and also making sure that all your old links to characters, wiki pages, items, and so forth automatically redirect to your new custom campaign URL. We don\u2019t want to underestimate the difficulty here, so as with our File Storage stretch goal, we\u2019re shooting to complete this stretch goal after the main reforging process. Our target date for the custom URLs would be mid-October 2013.\nStretch Goal #3 - File Storage Locker - $35,000 - ACHIEVED!\nWe\u2019ve always wanted to expand our image upload to include files of any type. Every campaign has files they need to share, like PDFs of your world\u2019s history or MP3s of your campaign theme music. If we hit this stretch goal we can add a spot in every campaign to store and manage all your shared files, so it\u2019s easier to keep all your campaign materials in one place.\nPlus, if we can hit this stretch goal, we will be able to increase the storage size limits for both free and Ascendant campaigns. The free limit will climb to 250MB and the Ascendant limit will rise to 10GB. That should be plenty of space to share everything your group needs.\nNote: For this and all future stretch goals, we are targeting a post-August release date. We will do our best to get as much completed as we can by August, but we want to be realistic and open about our timelines. For the file storage locker, we\u2019re aiming for sometime in September.\nStretch Goal #2 - Names! Names! Names! - $20,000 - ACHIEVED!\nSince the beginning, I've wanted a good, solid random name generator as part of the character creation and management. So many times I've been staring at my players, mouth hanging open, waiting for a name to come out. They had asked about an NPC I hadn't prepared, and I just needed a name. Here, let me explain:\nSo what are the particulars of the name generator?\nA variety of different naming \"genres\". You'll be able to quickly switch between Elven-ish, Dwarven, guttural Ork (think lots of Ks and Xs), and so forth.\nFast! - It will be right there when you need it, ready to give you the name you need and keep your players in the game.\nIntegrated - Instead of just spitting a name at you, you'll be able to create a new barebones character on the fly with the name pre-generated. So, when your players ask about that random new NPC 3 months later, they will be tracked normally in Obsidian Portal, just like all your other characters.\n\nStretch Goal #1 - Reworking the Maps - $10,000 - ACHIEVED\nThe campaign maps have been one of our favorite features since the beginning, but just like everything else, they need some work to make them better! If we hit this goal, we will be able to make the following improvements:\nDeeper zoom levels for Ascendant maps - 5 instead of the current 3\nHigher resolution images - 4096x4096 pixels instead of the current 1024x1024\nA library of map markers - Different colors and shapes. Imagine dropping crossed swords to mark a battle, a tower to mark a wizard's abode, and a cave for...a cave. That's the idea.\nBetter connection with the rest of your campaign - Add markers for specific characters and/or wiki pages, instead of only the general purpose markers we have now.\nThe maps are already fun. Now let's reforge them into something truly useful and awesome!\nObsidian Portal Reforged\nObsidian Portal is the award-winning online campaign management system for tabletop role-playing games. We want to revitalize the existing Obsidian Portal by increasing its functionality, adding new features, and cleaning up the design. We are taking the strong core that is Obsidian Portal, heating it up in the furnace, and reforming it into a sleeker and sharper tool. A better Obsidian Portal will make your life easier as a game master, which will make your game the best it can be. That\u2019s what \u201creforging\u201d is all about.\nImprovements\nTo provide you with the best possible experience, we\u2019ll revamp the most frequently used parts of the site and rework them so that they\u2019re easier to use. We will be examining every page for ways to make them flow better, provide the information you need, and allow you to navigate and manage your campaign faster and easier. The redesign will add more features to enhance your gaming.\nA perfect example of this is our plan to create a campaign dashboard that will put the most important details of your campaign right at your fingertips. The dashboard is just the first of many changes that will fundamentally enhance Obsidian Portal and make it a much better tool than it is today.\nA very rough draft of the new dashboard\nWe\u2019ll be supporting these functional changes by improving the overall design of the site. We\u2019ll take our current site and give it a consistent look and feel that will make it more intuitive to use\u2014not a button here and a link there, but a cohesive design strategy.\nWith more of your support, there\u2019s even more we can do to make Obsidian Portal the most robust campaign management system. If we make our original goal, keep an eye out for stretch goals for additional improvements.\nBack us now and get a year of premium Ascendant membership at a reduced price when you back at the Ascendant level.\nWhy Obsidian Portal?\nIt\u2019s free to use and built from the ground up, for gamers by gamers. We host a huge community of tabletop RPG players who are all looking to get the most out of their tabletop gaming experience. You play your campaign and we help you manage it. It\u2019s that simple.\nWith Obsidian Portal, you can manage your tabletop RPG campaign from any computer, anywhere. You can tell your story and get recognized for your innovation and creativity. Now help us take Obsidian Portal to the next level!\nBenefits to Backers\nA year of premium Ascendant membership (Hasted Ascendant level and above). Not a GM yourself? No worries, the Ascendant time can be gifted to your GM!\nCool backer-only souvenirs like campaign maps, custom map markers, profile badges, t-shirts, letterpress cards, and more\nThe opportunity to have a hand in the reforging process. All backers will receive developer updates along the way for an exclusive look at the design process. Plus, Tinkerer Ascendant level and above will be able to provide feedback during the design and beta testing.\nA slicker, more useful, easier to navigate Obsidian Portal. A better Obsidian Portal will make your life easier as a game master and improve your game.\n\nMy Backstory\nWhen I started Obsidian Portal in 2006, I knew I needed to set aside some real time and focus hard to make progress. To accomplish this, I quit playing video games altogether and told myself I wouldn't play again until the site launched. If you're a gamer like me, then you know how hard that is, and also how much time that can free up. I accomplished some amazing things in those first 9 months, and it's thanks to that dedication that Obsidian Portal is where it's at now.\nFast forward to now. Over the summer, I have the chance to focus on Obsidian Portal almost full time. Plus, I have a team of designers and programmers lined up to help out. So, in the spirit of what it took to launch, I'm once again swearing off video games and putting my nose to the grindstone. It will be a hot and sweaty summer, but by GenCon in August we will have some awesome progress to show for it!\nYou've seen what I can do by myself on nights and weekends. Now let me show you how awesome we can be with a real team working near full time!\nBacker Level Details\nYour name or username on a special Obsidian Portal page listing Kickstarter backers.\n\nYour name or username on a special Obsidian Portal page listing Kickstarter backers.\nA badge for your Obsidian Portal profile identifying you as a Reforger.\n\nYour name or username on a special Obsidian Portal page listing Kickstarter backers.\nA badge for your Obsidian Portal profile identifying you as a Reforger.\nA postcard thanking you for supporting us in the Reforging process.\n\nExample of the finished postcard thank you\n\nYour name or username on a special Obsidian Portal page listing Kickstarter backers.\nA badge for your Obsidian Portal profile identifying you as a Reforger.\nA postcard thanking you for supporting us in the Reforging process.\n1 year of Ascendant subscription time (a 20% discount off the normal price of $39.99/yr) - You can choose to redeem the subscription time immediately following the Kickstarter or wait until the Reforging is complete in August.\n\nYour name or username on a special Obsidian Portal page listing Kickstarter backers.\nA badge for your Obsidian Portal profile identifying you as a Reforger.\nA postcard thanking you for supporting us in the Reforging process.\n1 year of Ascendant subscription time (a 12.5% discount off the normal price of $39.99/yr) - You can choose to redeem the subscription time immediately following the Kickstarter or wait until the Reforging is complete in August.\n\nYour name or username on a special Obsidian Portal page listing Kickstarter backers.\nA badge for your Obsidian Portal profile identifying you as a Reforger.\nA postcard thanking you for supporting us in the Reforging process.\n1 year of Ascendant subscription time - You can choose to redeem the subscription time immediately following the Kickstarter or wait until the Reforging is complete in August.\nAccess to the beta forum to discuss the reforging and provide feedback as it progresses\nA special badge for your Obsidian Portal profile identifying you as a core member of the Reforging process\n\nYour name or username on a special Obsidian Portal page listing Kickstarter backers.\nA badge for your Obsidian Portal profile identifying you as a Reforger.\nA postcard thanking you for supporting us in the Reforging process.\n1 year of Ascendant subscription time - You can choose to redeem the subscription time immediately following the Kickstarter or wait until the Reforging is complete in August.\nAccess to the beta forum to discuss the reforging and provide feedback as it progresses\nA special badge for your Obsidian Portal profile identifying you as a core member of the Reforging process\nA limited edition t-shirt available only to Reforger backers.\n\nYour name or username on a special Obsidian Portal page listing Kickstarter backers.\nA badge for your Obsidian Portal profile identifying you as a Reforger.\nA postcard thanking you for supporting us in the Reforging process.\n1 year of Ascendant subscription time - You can choose to redeem the subscription time immediately following the Kickstarter or wait until the Reforging is complete in August.\nAccess to the beta forum to discuss the reforging and provide feedback as it progresses\nA special badge for your Obsidian Portal profile identifying you as a core member of the Reforging process\nA limited edition t-shirt available only to Reforger backers.\nEarly access to the beta server to play with the updates and new features as they are developed.\nA handmade letterpress card inviting you to the beta program.\n\nYour name or username on a special Obsidian Portal page listing Kickstarter backers.\nA badge for your Obsidian Portal profile identifying you as a Reforger.\nA postcard thanking you for supporting us in the Reforging process.\n1 year of Ascendant subscription time - You can choose to redeem the subscription time immediately following the Kickstarter or wait until the Reforging is complete in August.\nAccess to the beta forum to discuss the reforging and provide feedback as it progresses\nA special badge for your Obsidian Portal profile identifying you as a core member of the Reforging process\nA limited edition t-shirt available only to Reforger backers.\nEarly access to the beta server to play with the updates and new features as they are developed.\nA handmade letterpress card inviting you to the beta program.\nA custom video made by the talented Mikhail Twarogowski, who composed our Kickstarter video for us.

We just unlocked The Genius Guide to the Godling and BATTLE MUSIC FOR BASTARDS!\nIMPORTANT INFO:    \nWe're in the FINAL HOURS and there are still some terrific backing options available:\n*** Pledge at the $250 level and you could PLAY in the World's Worst Dungeon Crawl at Gen Con! ***\n*** There's still ONE $350 pledge available out there. NAME A PC plus all the $250 level rewards! ***\n*** Pledge at the $150 level and you might become the game's OFFICIAL DICE FLUFFER! ***\n*** We will be making ADD-ONs available AFTER the campaign! ***      \nUPDATE 11 has more extensive details.\nNew Reward Reference Chart\nWe have a great set of rewards for backers. To help you break it down we've put together this handy reference chart.\nHey gamers, over the years I\u2019ve given advice to thousands of players on how to KICK ASS (play a dwarf!) TAKE NAMES (inscribe them on your axe) and CRUSH DUNGEONS IN STYLE (hint: SWEATBANDS) but I\u2019ve largely neglected to help those unfortunate souls sitting on the OTHER side of the screen \u2013 the DM.\nWHY? \nBecause being the DM is EASY. You just read some boring boxed text and send a couple of goblins into the room. A SECOND-GRADER COULD DO IT.\nSome of my critics disagree. \u201cEASY?\u201d they say, as globules of rage fly across the room. \u201cYou think running an inventive, engaging, BADASS RPG adventure is EASY?\u201d\nThat\u2019s right. And I\u2019m going to PROVE it by taking the World\u2019s WORST Dungeon Crawl and making it AWESOME.\nBased on decades of RPG experience, I\u2019ve culled together the most odious PCs, plots, and encounters and built a Frankenstein\u2019s MONSTER of BADASSITUDE. It\u2019s called Flaming Deathpits of the Minotaur Mage: Descent into Doomfire! It has a hackneyed \u201cSave the Princess\u201d plot. It has pyromancer named \u201cSteve.\u201d It has ROLE-PLAYING.\nYeah, you\u2019re right: it sounds like a total train wreck. And I\u2019m going to climb that train, stoke its engines with 200cc\u2019s of pure, undiluted DUNGEON BASTARD GUSTO and CRASH that thing directly into the BIGGEST, most NOTORIOUS gaming convention of them all: GEN CON 2013.\nThat\u2019s right \u2014 I don\u2019t do things HALFWAY, gamers. If I\u2019m going to prove how easy it is to take the World\u2019s Worst Dungeon Crawl and make it TOTALLY AWESOME, I\u2019m going to do it LIVE, in-person, before a crowd of the world\u2019s most hard-core gamers.\nI hope to present this \u201cmasterpiece\u201d of fantasy adventure not only as a published RPG adventure for you to enjoy with your fellow gamers, but also as a live event at GEN CON immortalized on video to help motivate and inspire your PERSONAL gaming group. Your contributions help create, publish and host the game and document it in the polished, professional style you\u2019ve come to expect from the Dungeon Bastard. The result should be a lot more fun than \u201cThe World's WORST Dungeon Crawl\u201d HAS ANY RIGHT TO BE.\nThe stretch goals continue to tumble like a half-elven thief in a cavern full of storm giants!

Let\u2019s start with experience: I\u2019ve been playing RPGs since I was 14. I\u2019ve been attending GEN CON since its Milwaukee debut. That\u2019s A LOT of gaming. I\u2019ve playtested rules systems, written \u201cdungeon duel\u201d-style Con events, and helped host NASCRAG \u2013 the longest-running independent RPG tournament at GEN CON. I know what works, what doesn\u2019t work, and what doesn\u2019t even qualify for unemployment.\n\nSecond, I know a dirty secret regular RPG authors would NEVER tell you: your game can be fun DESPITE the scripted adventure. That\u2019s my goal here. To take a trite premise and a hackneyed plot and prove that NONE OF THAT MATTERS when you game THE DUNGEON BASTARD WAY.\n\nFinally, there\u2019s the reflexively amplifying nature of trying to create the World\u2019s WORST Dungeon Crawl: anything that goes wrong inherently makes the adventure EVEN WORSE. You've heard of a \"WIN-WIN\"? This is a FAIL-FAIL-WIN!\n\nThat\u2019s not to say I\u2019m deliberately trying to tank this thing. On the contrary, I take pride in delivering a QUALITY PRODUCT \u2013 whether that\u2019s the written adventure or the final video of the live event. I\u2019ve worked with professionals in the field, and I share their professional standards.\n\nI have the experience, equipment, and team in place to make the World\u2019s WORST Dungeon Crawl TRULY AWESOME.

You use your voice to explore a hypnotic world of sounds and visuals that feel like they are emerging directly from your body. Each tone will navigate you through strobing tunnels-of-light, impossible shapes, and into a meditative trance. The result is an elegant symmetry of image, sound and body that takes advantage of loopholes in the way you perceive to facilitate a new experience of yourself and your world. Each play-through lasts one extremely intense hour. \nThere is no right way to play SoundSelf: Play with different sounds and the game will dance with you, or sustain long tones and SoundSelf will take you deep into your own sonic universe. Play alone, or share the experience with friends - no two players will have the same journey, and no one player will experience what many will together.\nPlay the Prototype for Free\nDownload Mirror 1: \nhttp://wraughk.com/SoundSelfBuild/SoundSelf-2013-04-04.zip\nDownload Mirror 2: \nhttp://evanbalster.com/soundself/SoundSelf-2013-04-04.zip\nPrototype Requirements (the final game will be more light-weight): \nWindows 7 or 8 / Mac OS X 10.6 64 bit\nIntel i5 cpu or better \nHeadphones \nMicrophone (can just be your webcam's mic)\n\nStretch Goal:  \n$36,000: Deep-playa installation at Burning Man!\nBurning Man has been a continuous source of inspiration to the SoundSelf team. Taking this as a deep-playa structure to Black Rock City would give us an opportunity to \"pay forward\" that inspiration to the next generation of interactive art projects, and also provide a unique platform to experiment with SoundSelf as a shared collaborative experience.\nCost Breakdown\nWe currently have a working prototype of SoundSelf that explores the hypnosis sensation, but has a limited amount of content and only feeds off of the player's voice in superficial ways. It is the result of one year of research and experimental development, and it's already an unusual and powerful experience.\n$18,000 in development funds is enough for us to complete SoundSelf to our satisfaction by early 2014. Additional funds would allow us to create more content to support longer, more intricate experiences, and experiment with more intricate interactivity. Even more development funds would allow us to add some exciting new features.\nAbout the Creators\nDeveloper   \nRobin Arnott is the sound designer for Antichamber, and creator of \"that creepy gas mask game\" Deep Sea.\nSoftware Engineer  \nEvan Balster is a programmer whose current workings include current workings include an opensource audio engine and a system for dynamic body language and kinematics.\nArtistic Director  \nTopher Sipes is an illustrator, graphic designer, hoop dancer, and the creative director of Artheism.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nExperiment: The biggest risk is that SoundSelf won\u2019t be what you expect.

With Torment, we're striving to create a rich role-playing experience that explores similar deep, personal themes. Here's the scoop:\nTorment is a single-player, isometric role-playing game.\nYou will play a single, specific character, though you will encounter optional NPC companions you may choose to include in your party.\nThe story-driven game will have a rich dialogue system.\nThe game will be developed in the Unity engine for PC (Windows), Mac, and Linux platforms.\nThe game will be available in English, French, German, Italian, Polish, Russian, Spanish.\nThe game will be distributed DRM-free.

Mostly because awesome.\"\n- Markus \"Notch\" Persson, creator of Minecraft and owner of Mojang, on his pledge to Torment: Tides of Numenera\nTorment's Four Pillars\nFour pillars undergird the Torment name and, despite all the shake we'll do of RPG conventions, we'll stay true to these throughout the development of Torment: Tides of Numenera.\nA Deep, Thematically Satisfying Story. The philosophical underpinnings of Torment drive the game, both mechanically and narratively. Your words, choices, and actions will be your primary weapons.\nA World Unlike Any Other. The game has a fantastic, original setting, with awe-inspiring painterly visuals, imaginative locations, truly offbeat items, and massive feats of magic. In Numenera, however, \u201cmagic\u201d is actually something surprisingly different.\nA Rich, Personal Narrative. The story is thoughtful and character-driven\u2014epic in feel but a deeply personal narrative, with nontraditional characters and companions who have their own motivations and desires that drive them throughout the game.\nReactivity, Choice, and Real Consequences. The game emphasizes replayability and reactivity, and your choices will make a real difference. You can play the game with a different approach and discover entirely new pathways. Most important, we won\u2019t tell you how to play. The best ending is the one you choose, flowing naturally from your actions throughout the game.\nClick this header to learn more about our story at our tumblr site\nThe original Torment was a novel experience, a genre-defying game that helped redefine what was possible in RPG storytelling. We mentioned our Four Pillars above, and describe them in greater detail at our tumblr site.\nHere\u2019s a brief summary of our story:\n\nYou are the Last Castoff, the final link in the chain of the lives of the being they call the Changing God. He once was a man who discovered a way to use the relics of the ancients to cheat death and skip across the face of centuries in a succession of bodies. But he never knew that his bodies lived on as his consciousness fled, a new consciousness arising in each. Now he has awakened an age-old enemy, the Angel of Entropy, and his days of change are gone as the Angel hunts him and all his works. That includes... you.\n\nWith the ever-present threat of oblivion looming over you, you must find your sire before he\u2014and you\u2014are eradicated by the avenging Angel. You will find allies and enemies among the other castoffs. You might inhabit their minds for a time through the devices called \u201cthe Meres,\u201d turning their lives to your advantage. You will travel across the face of the Ninth World, and above and below it, with your companions at your side\u2014or alone, if you wish. Your quest will take you to alternate dimensions and distant worlds under strange suns; particular Meres might afford you even more bizarre experiences, such as folding time itself. And you will build your legacy as you find your answer to the question:\n\nWhat does one life matter?\nSojourner of Worlds (by Chang Yuan)\nClick this header to learn more about gameplay at our tumblr site\nTorment will have a strong emphasis on story and character development, which will permeate other facets of gameplay, such as combat and exploration. The Ninth World is a place of great mystery and wonder, all waiting to be discovered. To read more details of our gameplay plans, including information on Combat, Dialogue, and Companions, please visit our tumblr site.\nYou'll play the role of a specific individual. At the game\u2019s start, however, you are a blank slate and have control over the path you take through the story, and you will also make choices to customize your abilities and skills. We\u2019re taking the approach of having you role-play a specific individual so that we can focus on telling a very personal tale \u2013 yours.\nDust and Water (by Andr\u00e9e Wallin)\nWhat Are the Tides?\nThere are unseen forces in the Ninth World, forces that have profound and lasting effects for those attuned to their motions. Like gravity or magnetism, the Tides are invisible, powerful, and with the right tools, perhaps controllable.\nThe Tides represent complicated concepts that aren't entirely definable by language. Those who acknowledge the Tides have given them symbolic colors based on how they appear to correspond with emotional and psychological reactions. For example:\nThe Tides reflect your choices, the subtle currents of motivation that ripple through your life.\nThe colors are important, because a word like \"justice\" (for example) is too simplistic. The Indigo Tide represents not only justice and fairness; it might also mean a desire for the greater good or an \"end justifies the means\" mentality. The Gold Tide can represent false philanthropy as well as martyrdom\u2014it's the actions that matter, not the motivations. In the game, the Tides serve as a kind of alignment system\u2014but a more nuanced one, and one that does not judge actions based on whether they are good or evil. You'll learn more about the Tides as you explore Torment. And the Tides will gradually change based on your actions and decisions, ultimately determining your Legacy.\nWhat Do You Mean by My Legacy?\nThere's your legacy, the stories others tell about you and the inspirations they find in your life, and your Legacy, which we're systematizing here. Your Legacy is determined by which Tides you manipulate the most. Do you use your wisdom to help others? Do you seek power for the greater good? Maybe you're an avenger, taking whatever action is necessary to aid those around you. Perhaps you're just in it for the prestige. (Or money. People are always in it for the money.) As your choices move the Tides, your Legacy will be revealed.\nYour Legacy also influences the world around you. Weapons and relics may have different bonuses for characters with certain Legacies. Some of them might respond positively if you've revealed yourself to be a thinker or an artist, while others might help you only if you're moved by passion and power.\nYour Legacy opens new potential abilities. Some Legacies can change the very structure of your body, giving you superhuman powers: the ability to read the past in the minds of the dead, for instance, or a nearly supernatural affinity with weapons.\nSagus Cliffs at Dawn (by Chang Yuan)\nClick this header to learn more about our team at our tumblr site\nTorment is being developed by inXile entertainment, a mid-sized independent game developer located in Newport Beach, CA. inXile was founded by Brian Fargo in 2002 and is best known for its action-RPG The Bard\u2019s Tale. The Android version of that game was released in fall 2012, topping the charts and winning several awards. \nWith inXile, Brian has embraced the crowdfunding approach. He is a vocal advocate of circumventing the traditional publisher-developer business model, with developers instead communicating and working directly with the players.\nOur experience with crowd funding has been wonderfully positive for us at inXile and has opened our eyes to the power of a direct relationship with the gamers. We want to create RPGs in a fashion and style that helped to make the true classics. And along these lines we've abandoned the typical developer/publisher model and placed our future in the hands of RPG gamers. We've embraced the crowd in every aspect. YOU are our publisher...and you are the best publisher we've ever worked with!\nThis process allows us to create the games exactly the way you want to see them. There is a purity of development when we can spend 100% of our efforts making the game with an open dialogue throughout the process. We'll start with a strong vision document that details our sensibilities, and from there we'll stay in sync with you, from concept through the execution of the ideas.\nWe've discovered that the best way to create a deep and rich RPG is to begin the pre-production process long before the production team have finished their current project. If we waited to begin the design work for a large scale RPG until after the programming team has completed their work, our budget would increase by 50% or more.  This would result in the hiring and firing process that happens all too often in our industry. We want to break that model and keep our great team together. This is why it makes sense for us to begin work on Torment now rather than later. The process has served us well in the past and allows us to bring you the best RPGs. If you have any concerns about our ability to deliver a great one, we encourage you to review our first look video of Wasteland 2 that was released just a few weeks ago.\nWe're grateful for all the support and look forward to bringing you the kind of role-playing games that we all love to play.\nWith Torment, Brian pledged to personally add $100k to the project if we reached the $900,000 goal but fell short of a million. And if funding beat $1 million, he pledged to instead contribute 10 cents from every $1 pledged from the $1 million to $2 million mark. Brian is thus kicking in $100K of his own (this is not reflected in the Kickstarter total and all will be applied directly to the development budget). Torment superfan Steve Dengler (@Dracogen) picked up the torch when we reached $2M, matching 10% of every donation from $2 to $3 million, and thus also putting in $100K of his own. These matches will be added post-Kickstarter to help offset failed pledges, and do not count towards stretch goals.\nThis product is participating in Brian Fargo\u2019s Kicking It Forward initiative, promising to pledge 5% of its post-release profit to other Kickstarter projects. We are proud to join the over 200 successfully funded Kickstarter projects whose founders share Brian\u2019s vision of supporting the independent efforts of others.\nThe Ascension of Kex-Lianish (by Andr\u00e9e Wallin)\nBy pledging at an amount above the Tier you have selected, you can include Add-Ons.

Fortunately, we collectively have more than 80 years of experience in managing them. Given our great progress in developing Wasteland 2, our experience with the technology, and our approach to Torment\u2019s design and production, we are confident in our ability to provide our backers with a quality game deserving of the Torment name.\n\nTorment\u2019s schedule has been designed to maximize both planning (preproduction) and polishing. This extended preproduction period controls costs and increases quality because we\u2019ll have a very well-defined product before production begins. Our target release date of December 2014 allows us 14 months for production and finalization. (In comparison, Wasteland 2 had 12 months, and Mask of the Betrayer had nine.) Furthermore, various systems and tools developed for Wasteland 2 will be used or adapted for Torment, saving development time and budget.\n\nWith a longer schedule, you might wonder how we\u2019ll be able to create Torment if it receives less funding than Wasteland 2 did. First, Torment's story is being designed to be highly modular and scalable. This approach not only lets us increase game reactivity and replayability, but it also let us keep the game's scope flexible. At our target funding, we\u2019ll be able to deliver a complete and satisfying game and as funding increases above the target, Torment will continue to grow in depth and size. But, as resources allow \u2013 if Wasteland 2 is a commercial success, for example \u2013 we are ready to expand the modular story. \n\nAlso, inXile has established secondary revenue streams that will bolster Torment\u2019s development budget. For example, last September, The Bard\u2019s Tale was released on Android, winning many awards and selling hundreds of thousands of copies in just a few months. While this doesn\u2019t provide enough money to create a game like Torment, it lets us invest in Wasteland 2 and Torment to improve their quality. Although Torment would not be possible without your support, we are self-funding a portion of the game as well. Just like you, we want Torment to be the best it can be.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #68", "update_userinfo": "Updated Our Journal (68): Servant of the Tides", "update_content": "tl;dr: Oom\u2019s debut, Content Update, new bonus rewards from Monte Cook Games, and a check-in on backer rewards.\nHey Exiles,\nEric Daily here.
