[{"backer": "Ryan Wolfe", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Welcome to Novus Landing - a seedy, dangerous spaceport on the edge of the galaxy!\n\nThis is the third 3D STL Kickstarter I have created in the world of \"The Ignis Quadrant\". This Kickstarter provides support-free minis, scatter terrain, space ships of all sizes, vehicles, and more for you to produce at home on your FDM or resin 3D printer. Rewards are for digital STL files to print the products shown and described in this campaign. Rewards are split into three categories: Scatter/Terrain,  Space Ships/Vehicles, and Minis - designed to be used together or independently, and all for normal tabletop gaming scale (28-32mm). All these models should work great for games like Starfinder, Star Wars Legion, Fifth Age (5e), Dark Matter (5e), and Cyberpunk games like Infinity (Note that each of those games listed  have all rights reserved, and this campaign is not affiliated or associated with those brands or trademarks).\n\n** PLEASE NOTE - This Kickstarter is for digital files (STLs) to make all these items on your own home 3D printer - these are not physical goods **\n\n**NEW BACKERS** - This project is successfully funded, and ALL the 15 planned stretch goals have been unlocked! There's over 70 support-free minis,  12 larger vehicles/ships, and 175+ scatter STLs included!\n-- click to view zoomable high-res version. Photos are a mix of resin and FDM prints. Some content shown may be part of stretch goals --\nThis project includes a large collection of thematic minis including aliens, creatures, characters, NPCs, androids, drones, and more!\nHigh-quality miniatures, suitable for resin-level detail but also great quality on FDM printers\n NO supports are needed for any of these miniatures, in resin or FDM. This is accomplished by smart posing and design, and slicing/keying where needed.\nAll models have been test printed and ready to drop on print bed and go.\nAll minis are included in based versions (pictured below), and also unbased for you to base yourself, use in dioramas, etc. Where split/keyed versions are needed, complete versions are also offered for those that want them. Some are designed to use with flight bases, such as these free ones I have on Thingiverse or the great ones by LITKO . I also released all the mini bases from this project for free HERE. \nWHY SUPPORT-FREE? Support-free is not just for FDM printing, it works GREAT for resin too. Support-free designs have many benefits, including being generally harder to break during travel and play (thicker components, merged geometry), less prone to print failure, and less (if any) cleanup and post-processing. You can throw a bunch on your printer, walk away, and come back confident - and get more models on your table faster!\n\nThe minis range in size from small creatures, to HUGE alien beasts. Scale is roughly 32mm (similar in size to Reaper Bones). The below image shows renders of all the models included with the minis set, and will be updated as stretch goals are unlocked.\n-- click to view high-res zoomable version --\n-- click for high-res zoomable version --\n---------------------------------------\nEvery space port needs some space ships! This project includes many space ships of various types and sizes - ranging from large, multi floor ships to small, sleek fighters. All ships are designed to print and assemble on FDM printers of most sizes, and designed to open for easy play and detailed interiors (many of the ships and vehicles will fit on resin printers as well). There's also many other interesting vehicles to help flesh out your space sport and scifi locations. They are all sized for play similar to the minis and terrain (28-32mm). Like everything in this Kickstarter, the vehicles print support-free, with the exception of a few odd-shaped pieces like window glass. Check em out:\n-- click to view high-res zoomable version --\n-- click to view high-res zoomable version --\n---------------------------------------\nThis project has all kinds of fun, modular terrain and scenery to build a wealth of different environments like cantinas,  warehouses, landing pads, gambling dens, outdoor markets, and more. It's far-future Scifi in theme, but much is styled to work great with near-future Cyberpunk as well. All items print support free, and are split/designed/optimized for easy printing, painting, and assembly (if needed). The below image shows renders of all the models in some sample configurations included with the scatter set & all-in pledge levels, and will be updated as stretch goals are unlocked:\n-- click to view high-res zoomable version --\n-- click to view zoomable high-res version --\n---------------------------------------\nI have all kinds of stretch goals planned - enough to nearly triple the core reward content! You can see what's unlocked in the graphic below. Unless otherwise noted, the models that are unlocked are in the previews above. Some stretch goals will be mini focused, some scatter, some a big vehicle, and others a mix - but I am attempting to balance the added stuff overall.\n[UPDATE: all stretch goals have been unlocked, nearly tripling the rewards content! ]\n---------------------------------------\nWho doesn't like free stuff? There's many free items released, and more coming, to sweeten the pot and give you something to print while the KS is in progress. \nI have released my second set of SCIFI DUNGEONSTICKS, which you can download and print right now. You can access all the other free releases in THIS THINGIVERSE COLLECTION. In addition, all the bases I have designed for this campaign are available for free HERE (which match my last free set of SCIFI BASES). The previous free/bonus models from my last scifi project, The Ignis Quadrant are also perfect test examples of the quality of what's in this project, available HERE.\n\nNOTE: Thingiverse has been flakey lately - if things aren't loading for you, you can download the free preview files and bases in Dropbox HERE. \n\nAlso I teamed up with Ben over at 2nd Dynasty to offer a sweet discount for his huge, epic starships! Click the banner below to visit his MMF store and use the code NovusLandingShips for 30% off, until Feb 28, 2021.\n--------------------------------------\nAs the universe of The Ignis Quadrant has continued to grow beyond my first two scifi STL kickstarters, I decided to create and Kickstart a professionally-drawn comic book series as well! The first 2 issues (Chapter #0 and Chapter #1) are released, with the next chapter coming soon. Many of the characters and environments in this project are reflected in the comic book. If you're a scifi fan (which we assume you are, since you're here!) we absolutely encourage you to check out the comic. You can read the free chapter #0 online for free RIGHT HERE, and buy the digital issue #1 RIGHT HERE\n--------------------------------------\nMy name is Evan Carothers, and I am a 3D designer and tabletop game accessory creator with hundreds of designs released via Thingiverse (ecaroth) and through my premium design company (EC3D). This is my 8th Kickstarter, and any of my thousands of customers can tell you about my track record of easy-to-print models - delivered on time. My skill and love for design has grown out of my passion for tabletop gaming, technology, and 3D printing. I design much of the content myself and work with many other great designers and artists to put these projects together. This is my third Scifi project but it's gonna be epic! You can take a look through my previous projects to get a feel for my team's design aesthetic, or check out some customer reviews. I am a tabletop gamer at heart, and all models are  printed, and often painted, by myself before being released.\n\nParticipating Modelers, Artists, Painters, and Printers\nCredit to these awesome folks who helped this all come together!\n\nJoshua Black, Sebastiano Di Grazia, Vitaliy Deaf, Ben Southall (Yasashii Kyojin Studio),  Ryan Calhoun (Cephalopod Studios), Povilas Selila, Alexander Buryak, Julia Kuznetsova (PolyGrimm), and Ulises Virgen.\nAdd-ons allow you to get additional awesome stuff at a great discount, and help push even further to unlock stretch goals! My previous projects have all been fantasy, but I know plenty of gamers play both scifi and fantasy, so I decided to offer them regardless. To get add-ons, just increase your pledge level by the amount indicated for whichever add-ons you would like. Once the KS closes I will be using a pledge manager (BackerKit) to help you finalize you add-ons. You can increase you pledge on KS now to help fund stretch goals, or get these after the campaign closes.\n\nTo add any STL stretch goals you must back the campaign at a level that includes STLs. If you only wish to\n The Terra Conflict - My most recent 3D printable Kickstarter, full of space-combat scale ships, creatures, terrain, and more for epic space battles and encounters. This add-on is equivalent to what's included in the '3D Printable STL Files' pledge level of The Terra Conflict, including unlocked stretch goals ($30 add-on for the base set, and $42 for the base set + both add-on fleets).\n The Ignis Quadrant: My first foray into scifi, featuring support-free minis, tons of vehicles and lots of scatter terrain for all your scifi RPG and wargaming needs! The Ignis Quadrant - The add-ons are is equivalent to what's included in all-in pledge level, (including unlocked stretch goals): Minis, Terrain/Scatter, or Vehicles (1 set for $25) or ALL IN (all 3 sets for $50).\n Empire of Scorching Sands: My last sprawling campaign, featuring Arabian/Persian/Egyptian/desert terrain/scatter, monsters, and minis - Empire of Scorching Sands - the add-ons are equivalent to the what's included in that campaign (including stretch goals): Terrain/scatter only ($20 add-on), Minis only ($20 add-on), or ALL IN ($30 add-on).\n Wilds of Wintertide: A chilly, northern project featuring icy, arctic tundra, terrain/scatter, monsters, and minis - Wilds of Wintertide - the add-ons are equivalent to the what's included in that campaign (including stretch goals): Terrain/scatter only ($18 add-on), Minis only ($18 add-on), or ALL IN ($25 add-on).\n A Den of Alien Evil - Everything from the first volume of my \"Community (Treasure)Chest\" series - Mind Horror scenery, terrain, and minis.

Anybody can signup for that license, and sell the models from this campaign under that license, and I will not be doing specific merchant tiers for this campaign. So to sell these files (and other non-exclusive EC3D sets) you just need to signup for that resale program and back this campaign to receive the files.\nEverybody hates waiting, and many people have been burned by poorly designed files and broken delivery timelines in previous kickstarters from other vendors. This is not the case with my campaigns. All core models, and many stretch goals, area already finalized and test printed - and the majority of files will be ready for delivery the second the funds clear after the Kickstarter finishes (usually 2 weeks after the date the campaign ends). I will be finalizing and releasing the remaining items as fast as humanly possible, with a goal of 90 days *MAX* after this Kickstarter ends for delivery - which is something I have successfully done for all my previous Kickstarters. Please note, historically I wait until I have released everything from one project to launch another, but I have a fantasy STL project launching right after this one, which is smaller in scope and already completed, and I'm confident will not slow my planned release schedule for Novus Landing.\n\nDisclaimer & Printing Requirements\n\nTo get the most out of the printable parts from this Kickstarter, you will need to have a well-tuned 3D printer. For terrain/scatter and FDM printer capable of printing at a minimum .2mm layer height (ideally <= .16mm), such as an Ender 3.  Parts are cut to small pieces to facilitate printing. All designs for terrain are cut and keyed to fit on a 200x200mm print bed.  For minis, a resin printer is ideal and all mini models are cut/keyed (only as needed) to fit on standard sized smaller resin print beds (such as an Anycubic Photon), with the exception of a few VERY large minis and some large spaceship parts. Minis will print on FDM printers as well - for a few of the more challenging models you might need to slow the print down a bit, but no supports will be needed.\n\nEvery part is test printed by myself and repaired to be manifold and ready to drop on your slicer - however, In the event that any issues with the files get past my own QA testing and process, and my other test printers, I will make every effort to fix the file and remedy the situation as soon as possible. I use Dropbox for file delivery so I can push updates/fixes. My number one goal is to make some awesome, unique designs you can have a ton of fun with on your tabletop!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are very few, if any, risks and challenges for this campaign.

Perfectly suited to this stretch goal is a mini that was requested by one of the paint contest winners: \"A spare part dealer for space ships and droids who looks like a fly (maybe a cousin of Watto ;-).

It can be prone to many mistakes and delays, even for experienced publishers.\n\nWe are proud to say that we're prepared for the task at hand and have years of experience in successfully producing board games and fulfilling Kickstarter projects.\n\nHere are the steps we take to prepare and reduce the likelihood of mistakes and delays:\n\n1. We have done significant pre-production. This includes having all the illustrations for the game complete and the graphic art over 95% complete. The production quote is in hand and ready to be initiated.\n\n2. We are working with an experienced manufacturing partner. We are familiar with their production requirements, timelines, payment schedules, communication methods and Chinese freight arrangements and costs for when it comes time for shipping. We will provide tracking information for the boat when the games leave China.\n\n3. We are working with an experienced fulfillment partner. We are confident that they can handle any amount of work we send their way. They have fulfilled many projects and have proven to be communicative, punctual and respectful when dealing with our customers.\n\nAbove all, I am 100% dedicated to backer communication. I will be transparent with our process and involve our backers as much as possible. I will be present daily during the project to answer any questions and I read every comment.

It's been completely rebuilt from the ground up in Unity. Read on to find out what this all means and why we are excited for this project.\nFantasy Grounds is a popular system for playing a host of different roleplaying games online.  It is used by more than 130,000 gamers worldwide to connect and play popular games such as Dungeons and Dragons, Pathfinder, Savage Worlds, Call of Cthulhu, and more.  This type of program is commonly referred to as a virtual tabletop, or VTT, due to their ability to emulate various part of an RPG session in a digital form.\nWhat makes Fantasy Grounds different than competitors is how we expose character sheets and automate large portions of gameplay specifically for each system we support.  This is done through rulesets.  Your experience playing Deadlands Reloaded will differ from D&D and will be unique to that environment, contain custom graphics, character sheets, and automation specific to that game system.  \nOne feature shared across most game systems is maps.  Some may use hexes while others use square grids and some may not use grids at all.  Facing is important in some and less so in others.  While FG has featured maps for many years, they have been primarily focused as reproductions of maps in existing adventure modules from our many licensed publishers. We believe that we can enhance these to provide dynamic line of sight, fog of war, and even map building support with painting and tiles.\nWhat you get for backing this project will be a license for Fantasy Grounds Unity (or FGU). This new game engine has all the great features of current version of Fantasy Grounds (soon to be called Fantasy Grounds Classic) along with new enhanced features. \nOriginal Features Supported:\nMultiplayer support for playing tabletop games of Dungeons & Dragons (2E, 3.5E, 4E and 5E), Pathfinder RPG 1, Pathfinder RPG 2, Starfinder.\nBuilt-in content for D&D 3.5E, 5E and Pathfinder 1\nOfficially licensed add-on content available for D&D, D&D Classics (2E), Pathfinder, Starfinder, Savage Worlds, Call of Cthulhu, Basic Roleplaying, Castles & Crusades, Mutants & Masterminds, 13th Age, W.O.I.N., Traveller, and Rolemaster Classic\nGeneric system support through our CoreRPG ruleset\nBrilliant Campaign Management\nIntegrated character sheets with lots of automation built in for playing and leveling (depending on ruleset and content owned)\nCombat Tracking\n3D dice\nFantasy Grounds Unity Enhanced Features Include:\n64-bit support to allow for more content (quality and quantity)\nNative support for Mac, Linux and Windows PC\nNetwork lobby for easy hosting and joining of games (no port forwarding required)\nTile based map building\nEnhanced Drawing Tools\nAdditional Dice Macros support\nA new FGU only skin\nDynamic Line of Sight with enhanced toggle blockers\nPaint with images, such as walls\nAnimated image effects\nBackward compatibility with all existing campaigns and DLC from FGC\nIn addition to these features, we are now poised to add even greater functionality going forward. We have lots of ideas for new features and this rebuilt engine will make it easier for us reach those goals and deliver consistent updates for free. \nTile based Map Building\nDynamic Line of Sight (LOS) and Fog of War (FOW)\nLine of Sight - Doors and Terrain\nMap Fx Layers\n New Grid Options\nAdvanced Dice Expression Support\nWe have already devoted over 4 years and 10,000 developer hours to this project. Any funds raised will help us push it over the edge and begin work on new features and functionality. If the project does exceptionally well, this may even allow us to add even more resources to the team.\nWe have over 1200 existing DLC and add-ons. Our goal is to prioritize these by popularity and work on enhancing as many of these as we can. Without enhancements, they will continue to function as they always have in Fantasy Grounds Classic. You will be able to add dynamic line of sight to maps and begin using the new features straight away. As we work through this large back catalog of DLC, we will do all the enhancement and upgrade work for you so you can just load it up and begin using the advanced features without having to define any Line of Sight blockers yourself. \nLink: www.fantasygrounds.com\nGreat! We anticipate that a large number of our backers will already be fans and users of our software. For you, we have added discounted Upgrade tiers available to get you up and running on the new engine as soon as possible. A lot of the time spent building the new engine was devoted towards making sure that everything you've already bought or created will continue to work in FGU. The only difference is that now you will be able to further enhance them.\nOver time, we will begin going through older products and enhancing them for you. Just look for the Update Available button to light up and stay tuned to our newsletter for regular updates on which products have been newly Enhanced. \nWhich Upgrade option do I choose?\nIf you bought your 1-time purchase license in 2018 or 2019, then pick the Rookie Upgrade for the license type you own: Standard or Ultimate. \nIf you bought your 1-time purchase license before 2018, then choose the Veteran Upgrade for the license type you own: Standard or Ultimate.\nIf you are on a subscription, then you will be able to subscribe to the new version once it is released on the store. If you want Beta or Alpha access, then you would need to get a Newcomer tier option on the Kickstarter. \nHow do I upgrade multiple license keys?\nIf your account has multiple license keys, it is possible that some of them are newer and some are older. Pick the tier that best fits your main license key that you personally use and then increase your pledge level for each additional license you have based on the age of that license.  Our survey system and fulfillment will allow some corrections there later on and we can always help on a case-by-case basis through our support email at the time of fulfillment.\nDo I need to pay a subscription going forward?\nOur newcomer tiers are 1-time purchase licenses for Fantasy Grounds Unity. No further subscription is required. If you had a subscription to Fantasy Grounds Classic, you may want to maintain that as long as you want to continue using that version. \nYes, Fantasy Grounds Classic will remain a viable product for many years to come. While the data is backward compatible, we chose to separate the data paths for FGU and FG Classic so that changes to one won't be reflected in the other. You can copy campaigns over to FGU to try things out there and maintain your original copy back on Fantasy Grounds Classic. \nOver time, we expect most users will migrate fully to FGU.\nDo I get access to Fantasy Grounds Classic if I buy Fantasy Grounds Unity?\nNo. If you already have a license or subscription, then you can continue to use that. The licenses will be different even though they share the same add-ons. \nStandard licenses can host or play in a game with other licensed users. An Ultimate license allows the GM to host a game for any number of players and those players can use a free Demo license of Fantasy Grounds. Initial copies will go out to backers only, but we will try to  send out the demo license links to backers at some point prior to launch so those can be shared with players for your game.\nWe have over 1200 DLC items available -- an entire gaming bookstore worth of games. It's too much to feature in the Kickstarter, but we have a select list of bundles below that you can choose from when we send out the backer surveys. Just increase your pledge amount for the add-ons you want from the list below. \nAlso -- Anything you already own on your account at fantasygrounds.com will continue to work with FGU, so you won't have to re-buy any of those. In fact, you can go shopping at fantasygrounds.com if you see anything on sale there during or after the Kickstarter and those items will unlock automatically for your account once you gain access to FGU during the Alpha or Beta.\nWhat if I bought my add-ons from Steam?\nYou will be able to use those in both versions: Fantasy Grounds Classic and Fantasy Grounds Unity. Our system will know what purchases you have made from either location. \n*Note: We have some unknowns about how the Steam Store will reflect purchases across the two versions of Fantasy Grounds. If you bought bundle items on Fantasy Grounds Classic, you may need to buy new additions to the bundle there instead of on the new FGU store page on Steam.  \n\nNew portraits commissioned from the Ultimate Gamemaster level by amazing avatar artist, Mates Laurentiu! \nArtist Bio: Born in Dracula's lands, Mates Laurentiu is a Romanian freelance artist with a love for fantasy, horror and science fiction.

We have booted tracks, webbed tracks and bear track currently but we would look to expand this out fully and maybe make a bloody tracks version as well.   For a follow-up we could even take suggestions or votes on what other sort of tracks you would like to see. Dragons? Great Purple Worms?

It is my hope that you find something to create awe and immersion for your gaming table in my offerings. I'm always trying to make an indelible mark on my player\u2019s imagination and create something that brings them back for more!!

Depending on how long those take, the dates could shift. \n\nOur team has been testing and developing on Windows PCs. We make notes on things that we know we need to check into for Mac and Linux support but we have not yet attempted builds on those platforms. It is possible and expected that there will be a delay between releasing versions for Windows PC and Mac and Linux. In the worst case scenario, Windows PC users may complete the entire Alpha and Beta process before the Alpha and Beta process begins for other platforms. \n\nWe will lock down the FGU Alpha Launch Party by the start of June.

Part of the appeal of moving to Unity and rewriting Fantasy Grounds was that it would give us a better platform to expand upon. Many backers asked us about supporting Vision and Dynamic Lighting, and we specifically excluded those items from the scope of our Kickstarter deliverables. Instead, we gave general responses that we would be looking into that and other features once we completed the initial port to Unity.\nI am now happy to announce that we have released this feature into our TEST channel for people to play around with and experiment.

The GM can then approve or reject movement on a per token basis. Once enabled on a map, any attempted move by players will need to be confirmed by the GM.

What used to be virtual reality is now reality, and sports that once occupied your flat-screen now occupy the world stage. The largest of them embodies the evolution and integration of athleticism and machinery. Once every five years, hundreds of millions of viewers tune in to witness the spectacle that is M.E.C.H.s: Mechanized Entertainment Combat Heroes.\nSuit up your Meeples for the ultimate battle royale with...\nSome items displayed are stretch goals and will need to be unlocked.\nThe amazing ITEMeeples are snapped into your Mech when you earn it in play!\nMotion GIF may take a moment to load.\nTiny Epic Mechs is an arena-style player-vs-player action-programming game. It features ITEMeeples with plastic molded power armors and a Mech suit that the ITEMeeples actually go inside of. \nIn Tiny Epic Mechs, players take on the roles of highly skilled and athletic Mech pilots. \nThey compete in a free-for-all battle royale over the span of six rounds. In each round, players select four of eight available actions to program. \nThese actions keep you moving around the arena while allowing you to deploy high-scoring defensive turrets, plant explosive land mines with hidden values, collect resources, purchase weaponry, and power up into your Power Armor or eventually the highly-sought-after Mech Suit. While each player has their own Power Armor, there is only one Mech Suit, reserved for the king of the hill. \nYour programmed actions are played out one at a time around the table until all players have executed their four actions. When you cross paths with another player, combat ensues. During combat, players exchange fire until one player is out of ammo and must retreat, or they are defeated and forced to reset. \nCombat is fast, and you can use each weapon only one time per fight, so the more weapons you have, the longer you'll last. Weapons are categorized into three types, and each type counters one of the other types. If you time your weapons correctly, you can counter your opponent and unleash a more powerful attack and gain an edge over them. Dealing a lot of damage to your opponent will wow the audience and earn you lots of points, which brings you closer to victory. You also score victory points every other round based on area control and who controls the Mech. At the end of the game, you also earn points for each weapon you own. \nWhy Back This Project? \n Great Gameplay! - Fast paced and easy gameplay gets you right into the action.

Corey\u2019s award-winning series of science fiction novels to the tabletop. Using the Adventure Game Engine (AGE) rules found in Fantasy AGE, Blue Rose, and Modern AGE, The Expanse takes players to a far-future solar system where humanity is divided: Martians, Belters, and the people of old Earth struggle for political power and resources, but even older, alien, forces are stirring in the universe, and human history is about to take an unexpected new turn. The Expanse applies the fast-playing and action-based AGE rules to spaceships, solar colonies, and adventure and intrigue in the far-future, where the actions of the characters may change the course of history!\nAs long time fans know, The Expanse was a roleplaying game campaign long before it was a series of novels or a TV show. We are delighted to bring it full circle with this game! And here's the best thing about The Expanse RPG: we've been working on this for well over a year and rules are done! They've been through multiple iterations and playtesting, and we've worked closely with Ty Franck and Daniel Abraham (together, James S.A. Corey) throughout to ensure we are getting The Expanse right. Now let's hear from Daniel and Ty themselves!\nPLAY\n\nWant to check the game out RIGHT NOW? Download The Expanse RPG Quickstart today! This is a 40-page PDF that includes stripped down rules, pre-generated characters, and an adventure you can play right away. The download is free. \nThe Expanse RPG Features \nThe Expanse is based on the exciting new Modern AGE rules-set, and includes many of its features, such as customized character building using Backgrounds and Professions, Drives for character engagement, and an abstract resources system. It also makes use of the Modern AGE approach to action, exploration, and social encounters, complete with stunts and systems for all of them. To get a closer look at Modern AGE, you can download the Quickstart here.   \nThe following are some of the unique features of The Expanse in comparison to other AGE games:  \nFortune: Rather than Health, characters have a Fortune score that measures lucky near-misses, close scrapes, and trivial hits before the character takes serious harm. Fortune is also useful for modifying die rolls and offering players some narrative control but, watch out! Spend too much of it and your luck could run out when you get caught in a crossfire!\nConditions: In addition to a running Fortune total, characters use various conditions to measure things like injuries and fatigue as well as tactical challenges like hindered movement or sensory abilities.  \nInterludes: The interludes in between encounters are given their own treatment, allowing players to make use of their \u201cdown-time\u201d (including long hauls between destinations in the System) to recover, do maintenance, build their connections with others, or pursue their own projects.  \nSpaceships: The Expanse RPG features a system to model and create spaceships and its own system for space combat, including the assault on Thoth Station as an example of the system in action!  \nThe Churn: The Expanse also offers something for the Game Master with the Churn: A ticking counter that measures the crew\u2019s progress through a story and just when things are going to suddenly go sideways and become even more complicated!\nTwo Editions to Choose From!\nWe are offering the core rulebook of the Expanse RPG in two formats:\nThe Standard Edition is now (thanks to unlocked stretch goals) a 224 page full color hardback with a poster map of the solar system. This is the version that will stay in print after the Kickstarter has been fulfilled. \nThe Special Edition is a deluxe version of The Expanse RPG. It features the same beautiful full color interior of the Standard Edition with a black leatherette hardcover and a ribbon bookmark. This version is a Kickstarter exclusive, so it will not be available after the close of this campaign. Thanks to an unlocked stretch goal, the Special Edition now includes a dust jacket featuring the game's gorgeous cover art!\nThe Expanse Game Master's Kit\nThis Kickstarter also includes The Expanse Game Master's Kit, which will ship alongside the book. It currently includes the following, but may expand with the unlocking of stretch goals:\nA three-panel landscape format GM Screen with vital game system reference tables on one side and three panels of Expanse art on the player-facing side.  \nA set of game reference cards, including an initiative tracker, stunt references, and action references useful for players at the table.\nNow includes pre-generated characters after a stretch goal unlock!\nNow includes an adventure after a stretch goal unlock!\nAbzu's Bounty\nAbzu's Bounty is the first campaign for The Expanse  Roleplaying Game. This series of six linked scenarios will let you kick off your adventures in The Expanse in style. All six parts were unlocked as stretch goals so the full campaign is a go! Best of all, if you back the Kickstarter for $30 or more, you get a PDF of Abzu's Bounty for free! \n\nDesign Team\nWe assembled a great team to design The Expanse Roleplaying Game. Steve Kenson is the lead designer. You may know Steve from our Blue Rose and Mutants & Masterminds RPGs, or from any of the dozens of RPG books he's worked on over the last two decades. He had the able assistance of Seth Johnson, Ian Lemke, Rich Lescouflair, Rob McCreary, Jason Mical, Neall Raemonn Price, Zack Walters, Nicole Winchester, and of course James S.A. Corey!\n\nImportant Note: Shipping!  \nWe are going to be charging shipping separately later this year when the books are almost ready, and it will be EU-, Canada-, and Australia-friendly. In our previous Kickstarters, we tried to keep it simple with just a few standard shipping costs but this has proved a poor way to handle it. International shipping can be brutal and in too many cases we were paying more to ship than we collected for it. Shipping rates can also rise after a campaign ends but before the games are ready to ship. So about a month from shipping, we will assess and collect actual shipping costs using a pledge manager. The upside is that you don\u2019t need to pay the full cost now. We also want to point out that The Expanse RPG Standard Edition will be sold through distribution and into game and book stores after backers get their books. If you are concerned that shipping is going to be too expensive, be aware that the Kickstarter will not be the only way you can get the game. If you can get it from your local game store and save yourself a lot on shipping, that\u2019s a totally reasonable decision to make. There are also special tiers of the Kickstarter for retailers, so you can also talk to your local store and find out if they'll be bringing in books that way.\nGamers and retailers may also be interested in our Pre-Order Plus Program. Basically, this lets gamers pre-order our games through their local stores and get the same special we offer on our website. You can find out more about Pre-Order Plus here. \nStretch Goals\nOur initial batch of stretch goals are focused on enhancing the core rulebook and GM's Kit, make them bigger and better. \nUnlocked!

The summer blockbuster had only just been invented. There was only one Star Wars movie. The voyage of the Battlestar Galactica had only just begun, and Buck Rogers had yet to conquer television. But between the pages of the Terran Trade Authority handbooks, enthralled readers were discovering a beautiful and brightly-coloured vision of the future, where wondrous spacecraft explored strange planets, navigated shimmering nebulae and fought desperate battles among the stars. Illustrated by some of the world\u2019s greatest science fiction artists and written by Stewart Cowley, the handbooks told the tale of mankind\u2019s expansion into the unknown and the trials and wonders they encountered. Conceived of as a \u201cJane\u2019s Guide\u201d for the future, the books made use of the stunning artwork produced for the paperback science fiction market at the time, reproducing them in lush colour and on glossy paper. Beginning with Spacecraft 2000-2100 AD in 1978, the Terran Trade Authority series went on to become a cult phenomenon, loved and fondly remembered by all who came across them. The Terran Trade Authority presented a bright vision of the future, optimistic about man's place in the universe, and featuring a strong undercurrent of mystery, wonder and adventure. In recent years the volumes have become collectors\u2019 items \u2013 expensive and rarely found, but never forgotten - and have gone on to influence creators around the globe. The setting has spawned two role-playing games and has been cited as a clear inspiration for the best-selling computer game No Man's Sky. Within the pages of the books are a veritable who\u2019s who of science fiction art, including such names as Jim Burns, Alan Daniels, Peter Elson, Fred Gambino, Colin Hay, Robin Hiddon, Bob Layzell, Angus McKie, Chris Foss, Chris Moore, Tony Roberts, and Trevor Webb. Now, with your help, we are proud to present a special 40th Anniversary Edition of the first of the TTA handbooks; Spacecraft 2000-2100 AD. It\u2019s time to return to the future!\nACM 113, Fatboy\nAbout Spacecraft 2000 to 2100 AD  \nThe Terran Trade Authority is an original science-fiction setting first presented in four large-format full-colour illustrated books, published between 1978 and 1980. Each book is presented as an \u201cin-universe\u201d document, detailing the history of the Terran Trade Authority and their spectacular spacecraft. This book covers the events immediately before and after the Proximan War Era, and is presented in the same manner as an aircraft recognition guide, made up entirely of spacecraft descriptions and art accompanied by details of their role and performance in the war, and occasionally their history afterwards.\nNomad Industrial Complex\nForeword to Spacecraft 2000 to 2100 AD: 40th Anniversary Edition  \nDuring the heady days of the Russian-American space race and the globally televised Apollo missions, the world watched enthralled as humans took the first faltering steps beyond gravity\u2019s grip. But as time passed public enthusiasm waned. The value and relevance of space research and its huge costs were questioned In the face of global social, political and economic pressures. But eventually, popular interest in space exploration re-emerged. A major imperative was the growing awareness of Planet Earth\u2019s fragility in the face of the demands we made on it. However successful we were in conserving our world\u2019s resources and developing new forms of energy, the fact remained that we were simply outgrowing our homeworld. The search for Earth-like planets and the technology to travel there became of paramount importance. The post-Apollo drop in popular enthusiasm for space research did not mean that the scientific community relaxed their search for answers. On the contrary, a growing number of major players brought fresh resources to the table. In addition to NASA and Roscosmos, the Russian Federal Space Agency, China, Japan, India, the European Space Agency and even private enterprise grew our knowledge base. Not just in how we would travel in space but where we might go. A major contributor was NASA\u2019s Kepler Space Telescope. Launched in 2009 to seek out exoplanets \u2013 planets beyond our own solar system \u2013 Kepler soon identified over 1000 of them. Only a dozen or so were Earth-like, as to qualify, planets could not be much larger than twice Earth\u2019s size and therefore rocky, in order to increases the probability of surface water. Such planets also had to orbit the \u2018habitable zone\u2019 of its sun where the average temperature allowed water to exist in liquid form. Identifying the \u2018Where\u2019 brought us to the \u2018How\u2019, the greatest challenge of all. Entirely new aspects of astrophysics had to explored and manipulated for interstellar travel to become a reality. The strongest contenders were forms of Warp Drive where the space-time continuum, the actual fabric of space, is distorted. Work by NASA\u2019s Dr. Harold \u2018Sonny\u2019 White made significant advances in Warp Drive technology using advanced Quantum Optics to create a space-time bubble around a craft that would enable it to move independently from the rest of space. By compressing space-time in front of the vessel and expanding it behind, faster-than-light speeds became possible. The key point in making interstellar travel a reality came about in 2012 with the founding of the 100 YSS (100 Year Star Ship Project) funded initially by NASA and DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency). The formation of Icarus Interstellar in 2011 and its Starship Congress of 2013 combined with the introduction of Brane Cosmology took faster-than-light (FTL) research to a new level. The creation of the Terran Trade Authority harnessed global research and made Warp Drive systems and our journey to the stars a reality.  \n~ CMDR Stewart Cowley Terran Trade Authority\nColonial III, Angus McKie\nAdd-Ons\nRPG Add-on\nTerran Trade Authority: The Proxima War.

A POD version will be made available for purchase should we reach this stretch goal.\n$15000 - Terran Trade Authority RPG sourcebook for the Cepheus Engine (A current Mongoose Traveller 1e clone) in PDF. A POD version will be made available for purchase should we reach this stretch goal. \nSHIPPING THE REWARDS  \nShipping is not included in the pledge levels. That's because for this Kickstarter campaign, we're going to send out surveys and collect shipping fees through BackerKit once we're ready to ship out all physical rewards. This not only means all funds raised in the Kickstarter are going towards covering the costs of production (creating an electronic edition from a print is not cheap. The cost of production include licensing fees, layout, and printing) but it gives us plenty of time to source the best and least expensive international shipping options through fulfilment agents in Europe and Asia. Thanks for being understanding! We know that for some it's much easier just to take care of the total costs all at once upon pledging, but we hope you'll see that this approach is not only better for the project but affords you the lowest shipping costs when the time comes.  \nCyclops, Colin Hay\nSpacecraft 2000 to 2100 AD is (c) 1978 Stewart Cowley.

In this game, players colonize the galaxy using their ships, which they will move on a modular board, allowing for a different map and different experience each time you play the game.\nThe rules are simple: Each turn a player has to move one of his ships in a straight line, as many spaces (star systems) as he wants but he cannot go over systems controlled by other players. After his move, he has to place a Colony or Trade Station on that system, thus gaining control over that system for until the end of the game, for which he will get an amount of points. When all of the players placed their Colonies and Trade Stations, the game ends and points are calculated. The player with the most points is the winner!\nWith these extremely simple rules, players will get into the game from the very start and they will immediately immerse in the depths of the tactical and strategic choices they will need to make, in order to score more efficiently at the end of the game.\n Social Stretch Goal is still active!\nHelp us spread the word around for the campaign by sharing the posts below and for each 20 shares + retweets we will include another Technology card!\nSharing this Facebook post on your timeline: \nhttps://www.facebook.com/smallstarempires/posts/1857701910957675\nRetweeting this post: https://twitter.com/ArchonaGames/status/994663787151192067\nAdditionally, we will be including another Technology card for each AUD $1000 that will be above the AUD $93.000 mark, or more precisely above the final stretch goal! \n To see more details on what the Fate of the Galaxy is all about, check out this Kickstarter Update!\nNew Add-on: TILES and 2 NEW CIVILIZATIONS!\nMake your epic Small Star Empires gaming nights even more epic by including this 5th and 6th player expansion! \n\nAlso, if you buy both the Deluxe 5-6 player expansion AND the wooden component set, you will get the 5-6 player wooden expansion set FOR FREE!\nCivilizations overview\n                                                             Get to know the Civilizations and their Unique Abilities on our blog post here:\nhttp://www.archonagames.com/2018/04/18/the-civilizations-of-the-galactic-divide/\nFor more information on Galactic Warlords visit our BGG Page\n                                       Download the RULES of the Base game HERE.Download the DRAFT RULES of the Expansions HERE.Download the Supermassive Black Hole mini-expansion rules HERE.\nDownload the EPIC GAME MODE rules HERE.\nDownload a Print and Play of a single scenario of the Solo Campaign HERE.\nCheck out Milan's overview of Small Star Empires at Essen Spiel 2016 by BoardGameGeekTV:\n And check out this overview of the expansions:\n Check out the companion Score Keeper app that is available for both Android and iOS!\nDownload the app for Android, or iOS.\n Watch The Dice Tower's review here:\n Watch Undead Viking's review here:\n Read I'm a Social Gamer's review HERE.\nWatch Epitrapaizoume's video review here:\n  Watch Life of a Board Gamer's review for Small Star Empires here:\nRetailers and Group Pledges  \nFor retail and group pledge orders, please write to us at contact@archonagames.com.

Naval Adventure 1: Shakedown will be a 32+ page scenario that throws your Travellers straight into the deep end, putting them on board a cruiser as it suffers a great disaster. Will they end up becoming true leaders of the crew?\nStretch Goal 3 - \u00a340,000: If we get this far in the project, we would like to expand the utility of the Element cruisers by adding some versatile pods that can dramatically change the function of a ship. In doing this, we will add to the page count of the main book to include them, plus add another giant double-sided poster so you will receive the blueprints for the pods. The pods themselves will include a Foreward Communications pod (which, among other things, will house a brand new 200-ton long-ranged courier ship), a pod dedicated to intelligence gathering, and an Exploration pod that will draw from the material in the Great Rift box set - have one of these and a Fuel pod or two on a ship, and you can start heading off into deep space on a true five year mission!\nCore Rulebook Discount\nAs with the Great Rift, we wanted to avoid a long and complex Kickstarter with multiple pledge levels - this Kickstarter is for the Element Cruiser box set and nothing else (though it may well grow in size with your help!). However, we also realise that some Travellers out there may not be completely equipped for using the Element cruisers, and we would not want to send you off into battle without adequate support!   \nTherefore, we are also offering backers the chance to pick up any of the current Traveller hardback rulebooks at a discounted rate of \u00a330 each, with the PDF copy of the book thrown in! These include:   \nThe Traveller Core Rulebook \nHigh Guard \nCentral Supply Catalogue \nVehicle Handbook\nSimply add \u00a330 to your pledge for each title you are after, and we will take care of the rest. We'll get in contact with you after the Kickstarter is complete to see which titles you want, and will send them to you immediately (no waiting for the Element cruisers, you will get them straight away).\nAs with the Element Cruiser box set itself, shipping is free worldwide.\nNavy Commander Pledge Level: Note that you can get all four hardbacks and the Element Cruiser box set with additional savings by pledging at Navy Commander level!\nAfter More Traveller?\nSeveral existing backers have asked us to offer more Traveller items. You may add any of the following to your pledge, simply by increasing the amount you have pledged by the appropriate amount (no need to increase your pledge level, just the pledge amount!). These items will be dispatched to you post free after the surveys for the Kickstarter have been sent out, or when they are available, whichever is soonest.\nPirates of Drinax: \u00a370\nPirates of Drinax with all 10 Drinaxian PDF books: \u00a395\nTraveller Starter Set: \u00a350\nThe Great Rift: \u00a350\nThe Great Rift with all 3 Rift Adventures: \u00a390\nMarches Adventure 2: Mission to Mithril: \u00a315\nReach Adventure 5: The Borderland Run: \u00a315\nBehind the Claw: \u00a345\nBehind the Claw is a big hardback book combining the Spinward Marches and Deneb sectors, along with a huge full colour sector map.

I am NOT a graphic designer. I am CERTAINLY not a writer. I will be brief.\n     These maps started out as a hobby, a way for me to beef up my environments for Star Wars Miniatures.  I began to share them online and they caught on with people.\n      Somebody suggested I get everyone to pitch in and print op some of them for my online friends. I did that in 2008. I thought it was a lark. It blew up into an actual job. It moved beyond just Star Wars, and our maps have become a staple for sci fi miniature and RPG gamers around the world. I found a business partner, a real life graphic designer, and we made beautiful maps together. We had websites, exclusive contracts with retailers, and my mom said she was proud of me. It\u2019s hard to believe people from around the world a pushing their little space men around on our maps!!! How crazy is that??\n     10 years and 50 maps later, we are extremely honored to celebrate 10 years of the Adventurers Atlas.\n     To celebrate, we have created 4 new maps, paired them with 4 of our favorite maps from back in the day, and added 2 never-before released maps that are sure to please.

Let me know if you have a special pledge request, and I will DO MY BEST to work with you!\n     Pictured below are some of the maps to be released.

See the link here for more details!\nForeword by actor, US Marine, and all around great guy Sam J Jones!\nAuthor Scott Woodard dug deep into the history of this genre-defining series, bringing every corner of the setting to vibrant life. Heroes can foment rebellion in Mingo City, marvel at the tree-cities of Prince Barin's Arboria, bake in Volcano World's Land of the Dead, and shiver in Frigia or the cruel Ice Kingdom of Naquk.\nAlong the way they'll encounter far more than just Ming's merciless minions! Bore worms, cave dragons, sharkons, wolvrons, and over FIFTY strange and exotic creatures roam the strange world of Mongo!\nBest of all, for fans of Savage Worlds, The Savage World of Flash Gordon\u2122 features all the new powers, Edges, Hindrances, and amazing gear you've come to expect...but also an incredible new Setting Rule called...\nAt the beginning of each session, the players are given the Cliffhanger token.

Let me show you what it is about and why I need you!\nIt will be distributed via Steam for Windows.\nTo watch the trailer + video with HD quality, go here!\nYou can build many things in Skywanderers. My vision is to create a building experience that feels intuitive and tangible, as if you were actually playing with real bricks.\nGreen hull and canopy are made from blocks, all the rest is bricks!\nThe game uses the one-meter voxel block that we all know and love. In addition to blocks, I created the brick system in order to build smaller details and mechanisms. The player can use a wide array of bricks of many forms and functions. They can be combined using stud connections:\nMobile user: if the gif does not play you can access all the gifs here!\nThere are no prefabs in Skywanderers, you have the complete freedom to design everything from scratch. Let's say you want a cockpit for your fighter: you get to create your own custom seat, build a canopy, an opening mechanism, and design the command layout.\nNow you can create custom doors, ramps, cozy interiors, weapon mounts, retractable landing gears, or anything else you can imagine! The game offers a comprehensive choice of logical gates and various rotators and sliders.\nYou can also paint anything: blocks, bricks, weapons, engines, commands, even lights!\nThis means you can create a lot of very cool stuff, from big warships, to little shuttles or small fighters, or anything else you can imagine!\nThe Basalisk is a 400m long behemoth warship.\nI also added mechs! They are really easy to setup, you can choose your stance: eastern (Gundam like) or western (mechwarrior like) style, and soon multi-legged crawlers will be added.\nI have just added hovercrafts, and one day you will be able to create cars, tanks and monorails!\nLand speeders are a lot of fun to race with your friends!\nAll my testers really enjoyed building in Skywanderers - and we are just starting to tap into the potential of the brick system. It is a really fresh and new way to build, I am sure you will enjoy it too!\nExploration is a major focus of the game. From mining rare resources in order to craft a unique technology, to venturing in the lawless outer rim to hunt a wanted pirate. Or just simply for the sake of exploring! I am dedicated to creating a rich and immersive galaxy for you to explore. \nYou start your journey using the holomap, where you can select your warp destination, or scan for nearby ships, stations or points of interest.  \nThen punch it and warp to a new system! \nWith Skywanderers, I want to go beyond the simple generic random skybox formula and have the player truly immersed in the galaxy. So everything from stars, clouds of dust occluding the galatic core, or nearby nebulae are accurately computed using their mathematical representations and your relative position in the galaxy. This means that when you look into the sky each feature of the skybox is really there. \nLeft: Close to the galactic core | Right: Further away\nExplore truly volumetric and procedural nebulae: each system gets an accurate view on them depending on their viewpoint. \nWarp inside a nebula, and you will get a truly stunning and colorful vista!\nFly inside and mine planetary rings. \nLand on and explore ring space habitats. Some being over one thousand kilometer wide! This still is a very early Work in Progress, the terrain's look especially will be improved.\nI've spent a lot of time creating a robust and fast procedural technology that allows you to transition seamlessly between all the various locations of a system.\nSoon I will add more stellar objects and hazards including: black holes, pulsars, large asteroids and comets\u2026 Check the FAQ for the plan about planets.\nUntil now my focus has been on crafting the hard tech behind the voxel building and the procedural generation engine. It was a lot of work! But it's getting there so now it's time for me to focus on three aspects:\nPolish, bugfix and optimization of existing components. There are some key refactorings I would like to do on top of the bugfix and polish phase expected in every game development cycle. \nMultiplayer functionalities. Although multiplayer is already a part of the game it needs more attention. Multiplayer is notoriously harder to test!\nTraditional gameplay other than building and exploration. I want to give the player a sense of purpose that will push him/her to build ships and explore the galaxy. This means systems design including weapon balancing, power systems, shield or armor balancing. But also mining, crafting, trading, or missions like bounty hunting.\nTo do this I need time! I have been self funding the development of Skywanderers for a year now, so to continue I will need additional funding. \nJust as important, I also need testers: this is where you enter the picture! Indeed I need people motivated by the potential of the game to test, provide feedback on existing or planned mechanics, and build and play in multiplayer. My goal is to have hundreds of testers spending thousands of hours collectively in the game before I hit Steam, to get a successful launch without hiccups.  \nMaking the Archimedes pushed the game forward in many different ways.\nCreating this game solo does not mean I have been alone: I am actually very lucky to already have a small community around the game! They helped me tremendously by hunting bugs, making me improve the building logic, feeding me with crazy build ideas and more generally pushing the game to its limits (special thanks to the 1600m Imperial Star Destroyer, and all those hinges / rotators stack madness). If you are curious check out what they have been building!  \nI hope you will join us in this adventure, together we can make a great game!\n How much we will raise will dictate how I plan the next months of development. Here is what will happen, think of it as a three stage Saturn 5 rocket:\nFirst Stage = Base Goal of 15000 EUR: The heavy lifting. This goal will allow me to work full time for 6 months before the early access release. I will focus on:\nPolish, refactor and stabilize the technology\nAdd ship systems like energy, weapon, shield and more\nImprove the multiplayer experience\nWork on the navigation and flight model\nSecond Stage = From 15000 EUR up to 50000 EUR: This takes us to orbit, where the fun begins! As we raise more I will add weeks of development to the game, up to an extra 6 months before Early Access release. I will work on the following:\nMining and crafting gameplay components\nAI and Missions\nDedicated servers\nBasic modding support for Texture and Skin\nAdvanced character customization\nImproved procedural generation\nThird Stage = Over 50000 EUR: The stage that will fly us to the moon! The money over this point will be used to remunerate people to work with me to increase the quality of the game:\nMaster builders to create high quality faction ships\nTexture artist\nSound designer\nComposer\nI will also save on the budget to be able to work on the following point post early-access release:\nDeep faction interaction system: missions, ranking, dynamic galactic influence\nSurvival mode (see long term roadmap)\nPlanets (see FAQ below)\nSo raising as much money as I can at this stage is very important. The advantage of working solo is that I can be very flexible and quickly re-adjust things on the way. Stretch Goals like gameplay are obviously key components to my vision. Even if only the base target is met, I plan to work on these after the early access release.\nI have ambitious plans for Skywanderers and a lot of crazy ideas. Hopefully with the support of the community I will be able to develop the game for many years following early access. \nOn top of the short term roadmap that will lead the game to Early Access, it is important for me to share my long term vision. Here is what a typical play through will look like in the 1.0 version of the game:\nEarly game: survive!\nYou will first have to explore and find the resources needed for your livelihood. Little by little, you will mine rarer materials and craft more advanced technologies by exploring the world around you. You will build a small exploration buggy, then a plane, and one day you will be ready for your first space trip - and land on the moon that has been peering down at you every night. Then you will explore your solar system, and will soon unlock the key to interstellar travel!\nLate game: be who you want!  \nFrom that point on it will be a different game. Soon you will discover that the galaxy is full of factions and species. You might encounter some threats or maybe distress beacons. You will dock into space stations looking to trade or take on missions. The game won't force you into a certain role so you might want to hunt down pirates or become one, you might want to build a massive battleship and go to war with your friends. Maybe you will prefer setting up a mining outpost, or you will build a network of stargates to link your bases. One day, you might even be able to build and manage your own space station!\nHouse Imperitus is feared for its heavily militaristic fleet.\nLore:\nIt's been 100 years since the Artura Insurrection was won, but the price paid was high. Now, Armistice station lies in disuse and virtual ruin, House Imperitus has secured its borders after leaving the Coalition shortly after the conflict ended. \nMore recently, having lost hope for any meaningful peace negotiations, House Elgari along with several of the other powerful Houses left the once proud alliance. The Coalition itself is but a shadow of what it once was, reduced to a parliament of squabbling smaller factions, each attempting to gain the upper hand against the others. All the while each house strengthens its military and prepares for another conflict.\nThe galaxy is in a state of cold war, and somewhere on the outer rim, a long forgotten eye opens, looking inward to the core.\nWith my Master Builders we plan to add the following factions over time:\nHouse Imperitus, a militaristic empire set on expanding their borders\nHouse Elgari, a race of aliens that promote peace and equality\nSenrai Mining Corporation, a massive corporation providing a huge amount of resources to the galaxy\nThe Coalition, the remnants of the Anti-Artura Coalition, made up of many smaller Houses\nThe Petcha, a loose association of space wanderers and refugees just trying to survive\nI like to view Skywanderers as a mix between Minecraft and Elite. The two legends who are Notch and David Braben also inspired me in my approach. Both showed us that it is possible to create very ambitious gameplay and worlds with very limited resources, by using clever maths and elegant design solutions.  \nThe game will also draw influence from games from very different genres: FTL, Mass Effect or Startopia for example!  \nTribute ship to my childhood built by yours truly.\nLEGO\u00ae  and more specifically LEGO\u00ae space is also very deep in the DNA of the game. With the brick system I want to give player the same artistic freedom talented MOC builders are using in their designs. All the sets I had as a kid but also as importantly the one I desired left an impression so big on me that it is at the root of my will to create Skywanderers.\nFor the background I want to mention Star Wars, Valerian (the French comic), the Fifth Element, Hyperion. Think funny Aliens species, rusted ships, space pirates and war raging among factions! Some aspect of the game will also be inspired by AC Clarke books, or the 2001 A Space Odyssey movie/book: the travel between planets will be smooth and wondrous, and the size of the astronomical bodies around you will make you feel tiny.\nRaiben, who is helping me to craft the lore, is a student of sci-fi media and has drawn inspiration from Battlestar Galactica, Star Wars, and especially Dune (a book he maintains is the \"Best Sci-Fi novel ever\"), as well as historical figures and groups to create an immersive and believable world within its own bounds.\nConsidering a pledge? Thanks you for that!  Please check out more info on the rewards below:\nName in the credits: if you wish, your will be thanked in the credits! Thanks will be sorted by Tier.\nDiscord Special Chat Room Access: You will have access to a private chat room on our discord. Each Tier will get an exclusive room - you will also access lower tier rooms.\nForum Special Title: Right now the community is very active on the discord but all the discussion on gameplay design will eventually move to the forum. The title will be awarded based on your tier level.\nThe game at release: The game will be released in Early Access on steam. If the kickstarter is over-funded and I take more time before public release, backers of the first Tier will gain access to the closed pre-alpha.\nClosed Pre-alpha: Help me make a great game! You will get access to the closed alpha on Steam around one month after the kickstarter end. Please check the faq below for info on the current state of the game! (did I mention it was pre-alpha?)\nMake a ship rewards: the following three rewards will allow you to build a ship that will be spawned randomly in the game. They will join the official ships to make the game more alive and will be found in random encounters, while visiting stations and outpost, but might also be used in random events or missions. You will also be able to name and customize the pilot.\nA few rules will apply: size limit is the maximum size on the longer axis - also no offensive/licensed content.\nSmall shuttle: You will be able to create a small 20m civilian shuttle. You are free to build it for any role! Examples: exploration ship, prospector, landing shuttle, racing ship.\nMedium civilian ship: You will be able to create a larger 100m civilian ship. Examples: Freighter, tanker, mining ship, deep space exploration, luxury yacht. Build what you want!\nPirate ship: Pirate will appears randomly in the outer rim or other lawless clusters of the Galaxy. They will attack the player, so you better build some serious offensive capability to make the fight interesting! You will build a 100m ship with its 20m support fighter.\nCorporation Fleet: Create your own corporation! You will have to build an 200m outpost, and fleet consisting of a 200m + 100m + 20m ships. They will be spawned randomly together.\nPirate Lord Fleet: Build a pirate fleet! The fleet consist in a 300m flagship, a 100m support ship and a 20m fighter. Should you choose this tier, you will have to build, a lot.\nNebulae can be seen from across the galaxy.\nDesign and Name a Nebulae: Nebulae are stellar objects several light years in size. A lot of players will get to see your nebulae in their playthrough, and some will even want travel inside it! I will provide you with a mini build of the game where you will be able to try various seeds in order to choose a nebula to your liking. More examples here! Galaxy is procedural but not randomized, each player plays in the same galaxy (think of it at everybody play with the same world seed).\n Legendary Pirate Lord: The Seven Pirate Lords are feared in the entire outer rim. Should you encounter one, flee - or better be prepared for a good fight! You will work with me and my Master Builders to select a hull and outfit a big pirate ship to your liking. Name and write the Pirate Lord backstory with us. If you are a talented builder you might even submit your hull and work with us on a truly unique ship.\nLegendary Pirate King/Queen: Design the ultimate pirate boss of the game! Player will have to hunt it, and better be prepared for a tough battle. Tell us your ideas or send us concept art, and we will make it happen. If you wish to you may also get to work on the ship with our master builder. Name and write the Pirate King/Queen backstory with us!\nWhat is the current state of the game development?\nFor now Skywanderers is a creative only experience. If you love to build for the sake of it, you will enjoy tinkering with blocks and bricks and build in a fresh new way. If, like me, you prefer a missions based or survival gameplay, you will have to be patient. In that case you can consider backing on the first tier, or maybe help me designing those gameplay components and watch them evolve as I work on them! The game is in PRE-alpha: it means that there are bugs, missing features, placeholder tech, multiplayer instability and more!\nWill there be planets? When?\nYes I want to make planets! But I want to craft large, beautiful spherical planets\u2026 So it will take a bit of time to get there. I prefer to wait to have more synergy with gameplay components, so planet are more meaningful to the overall experience. It is for that reason that I created the torus space habitats: I will be able to start coding ground based gameplay while adding to the planetary tech bit by bit: clouds, trees, atmospheric shader, procedural generation of terrain. In a nutshell, planets are on the roadmap but after early access release on steam!\nWhere can we learn more about the game?\nI have been creating devlogs and ship reviews regularly on youtube. You can also stop by our discord to chat with me or testers to ask for more info. There is also a subreddit, a website and you can follow me on twitter. \nWhat are the requirements?\nSpecs wise you need a decent computer with a DX11 capable card and a multi-core processor. The game and the closed pre-alpha for backers will be distributed via Steam for Windows. Minimum specs:\nGraphics: GeForce 6xx or higher or amd equivalent\nRAM: 4GB\nCPU: Intel Core i3 3rd Generation or amd equivalent\nWhen will the closed pre-alpha start? \nOnce the kickstarter is funded I will do the necessary paperwork to get the game on steam (the game was greenlit in March). Expect around one month after the kickstarter end, I will keep you posted on how things goes. During that time I will do bug fixing and work on a few refactoring needed, especially on the saving and blueprint system.\nWhen will the game be released publicly?\nAt least 6 months after the end of the campaign. If the game over-reaches the target it could stretch to a year so I can add more content. In that case backers of the first tier will get access to the closed pre-alpha after 6 months if they wish!\nWho are you? How long have you been working on Skywanderers?\nI am Francois Duret, a 34 year old french living in Japan. I quit my job one year ago to work full time on Skywanderers. Prior to that I have been working on evening and week-end on the game for over two years.\nWhat engine are you using?\nI am using Unity! This is really the perfect choice: I can save time by not solving problems generic to most video games, and Unity is flexible enough to cope with the specificities of Skywanderers like custom collisions, very large game areas, and much more.\nWill the game be released on Mac, Linux or Consoles?\nSkywanderers makes heavy use of DX11. Porting to other platforms is out of scope of this kickstarter as it would take me too much time at the detriment of the game. It might change in the future though!\n Credits and special thanks: Trailer music made Ross Bugden under CC. Some texture uses XSSheep PixelPerfect pack under CC.

The scope is large, but I want to take each step at a time.\nThe good news is that most of the hard, experimental tech is already there: voxel engine, brick system, blueprint I/O, logic system, custom collisions and raycast. \nBut also the procedural generation of the galaxy, stars and nebulae. \nNot to forget the asteroid and space habitat technology, the later being a ramp toward full planetary tech.\n\nNow I will have to develop systems that can be found in many other indie games, like the crafting, mining, trading, bounty hunting gameplay mechanics. It should be a lot easier, but the real difficulty will be to make them fun! So with your help to iterate enough I am confident in my ability to develop those systems over time.\n\nSkywanderers is already a game that have been played by around 50 testers, around half a dozen of them having played the game for more than a hundred hours already, so it wont be a vaporware!\n\nFor sure there will be unforeseen consequences, some ideas might not work and will be scraped - it already happened quite a bit. I consider game development as solving a multitude of problems to achieve a greater vision. This is extremely exciting and challenging, and with your help I will deliver the game a lot of you have been dreaming!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u20ac15 or more", "title": "Supporter", "descp": "Get the game when it is released on Early Access on Steam!\nINCLUDES:\nSteam Early Access Key\nYour name in the game credits\nAccess to a private room on the game Discord\nExclusive Title on the game Forum", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2018"}], "stat": ["299 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac25 or more", "title": "Pioneer", "descp": "Become part of the closed pre-alpha testing phase and help me make a great game!

Each player represents one of the remaining four Terran factions (mega-corporations) in the galaxy, who compete to increase their faction\u2019s wealth and defend their homeworlds against enemy ships.\nThe game's core is built around a refreshing approach to the deck-building mechanic, where each player selects any 1 of 10 different thematic Action Roles during their turn, which adds depth to the game and allows for strategic decision-making.\nEach player's turn involves a simple \"ABCD\" process:\nAction: Resolve the selected Role's Action.\nBuy: Make any and all purchases with the cards' Trade Value(s).\nConfigure Starship: Follow the formula \"S\"+\"W\"+\"C\" and place it in the Space Lane.\nDiscard:  Discard cards from your hand and refresh your hand to 5 cards to end your turn.\n  The game now comes with a full Solo Experience, which uses a deck of 18 AI cards to simulate the multiplayer game. Developed by Joe Pilkus and inspired by Morten Monrad Pedersen's Automa Factory, this Solo experience is sure to satisfy solo gaming enthusiasts. \nThe Initial deck consists of 12 AI cards, and a Development deck adds another 6 cards. The player begins the game by completing their Action, Buy, and Configure Starship Phases, and then reveals the topmost card from the AI's Initial deck and follows the instructions on the card. This continues throughout the game. When the player must shuffle the AI's discard pile (now consisting of all 12 cards), he adds to the mix the top two cards from the AI's Development deck.\nIf you'd like to know more about the Solo Variant, you can read the entirety of Joe Pilkus' guest post on Morten Monrad Pedersen's BGG blog, Thematic Solitaires for the Spare Time Challenged.\nThere are several different scenarios, which determine how the game is played and the victory conditions. \nTradewars: balance your collection of wealth with your need to defend your Homeworld, in this trade-driven scenario that provides a full multiplayer experience of the game.\nSpacewars: be the last player standing to win in this multiplayer combat-driven scenario.\nThe Derelict: a light solo play scenario focusing solely on space combat, which involves surviving an alien assault. This scenario is a great way to learn the game.\nCooperative Mode: players must come together and defend their homeworlds against an alien invasion!\nStill want to know more? You can download the rules for all the details, or view the \"How to Play\" and \"Reviews\" sections further down the page. Please note: the current set of rules are not final, and we'll be making further edits and clarifications to them over the next couple weeks.\nWe will be creating a downloadable rulebook in French, Spanish, Greek, German,Turkish and Portuguese.

Players add Mission Upgrade cards to configure Tradeships, allowing players to perform an outworld mission, which may take 1 to 5 turns to complete. During this time, the player will benefit from a Trade Agreement with an outworld colony, which will give them bonus credits when banking certain resources. Modifiers range from 2x, +5 and 3x the value of the banked resource.\nPerform Missions and form Trade Agreements with other Worlds!\nThis expansion adds 15-30 minutes of additional game time to the \"core\" game. However, this is offset by higher banking of resources, which ultimately balances the duration of the game.\nYou may download the Planetary Expansion rules here.\nMission and Colony (Trade Agreement) cards for the Brethren faction.\n    If you are adding on to the $1 Pledge Level, please add an additional $5 to cover shipping (i.e. you would add $14 to your pledge instead of $9).\nThis Optional Add-on includes a total of 11 custom dice; 4 \"Faction\" d6s (1 Red, 1 Green, 1 Blue, 1 Purple, engraved with gold pips and faction logos), 4 \"Planetary Expansion\" white d6s, 2 Exterra black d6s, and 1 Exterra black d10.

We had our fair share of them with our first campaign, and through that process, we learned a lot. We underestimated the amount of time both the pre-production/sampling and shipping process would take.\n\nOur first game was very complex to manufacture with many custom pieces. Fortunately, Tradewars - Homeworld is far simpler in terms of component complexity, so manufacturing will be much less complicated in comparison. We will also be using the same manufacturer, WinGo Games, which will ensure the manufacturing process goes smooth. We know exactly what to expect from WinGo, their communication is fast and thorough, and we know how to get the end product and quality that we're expecting based on their specifications and experience working with them. \n\nAside from manufacturing, shipping is something we have probably learned the most from our first Kickstarter. Setting up a worldwide logistics and fulfillment plan is much more complicated than we anticipated, and it can take weeks just to get through all the paperwork. Having now experienced that process, and being in the midst of fulfilling our first game, we feel that we will be much better prepared to circumvent shipping delays in the future by planning well in advance, and applying what we\u2019ve learned.\n \nIt is our highest priority to deliver this game to you on time or early.

But to me the exercise failed in confirming the \"print-quality\" and give us both (Stan and I) a clear picture of HOW the cards will look like in the end when the final product is made and shipped.\nWhere does that leave us?"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #54", "update_userinfo": "April Update", "update_content": " Hello to all of you!\nI hope all of you are doing well and staying safe.

Pilots (Variable Powers)! Now players compete to hire the best pilots, with powerful abilities, in addition to competing over the best planets.\nPilots are hired by activating 2, or 3, like dice. You activate 2 like dice if the pilot you're hiring is trained to fly the ship you're assigning them to, or you activate 3 like dice if you need to assign the pilot to a ship they are not trained to fly.\n2. Exploration (Press-Your-Luck)! Now you can send your ships into unexplored space on a hunt for resources or exploration badges! But beware, you may end up in the orbit of a black hole or being forced to lose resources of your own. To explore, you simply move a ship onto the exploration card. Then, if there are any exploration cards face up, you may take one. OR, you can flip over the top card of the deck, if it's red, you must take it and stop exploring. If it's green, you can take it, or go again until 3 exploration cards are face up, at which point you would have to take the next card you flip.\n3. Badges (Set-Collection)! Thought you had a handle on everyone's scores in Tiny Epic Galaxies?? Now you'll have to think again. Players will be collecting exploration badges from pilots they hire and exploration cards they acquire. After the game is over, players are rewarded bonus victory points for each badge type they have the most of. These points can stack up fast and provide opportunities for come-from-behind victories! \n  Since Tiny Epic Galaxies Beyond the Black is an expansion to Tiny Epic Galaxies, we will grandfather the component qualities from TEG into TEGBTB.\nFREE COMPONENT UPGRADES\n2mm Box Thickness\nSpot UV Box Logos\nBox Interior Printing (using the hangar image at the top of the page)\n310 gsm Ivory Core Linen Cardstock\nCards with Rounded Corners\nBelow are additional upgrades the game will come with if we are able to reach the listed goals.

Liu, GeekDad\nTransform any table into a professional gaming table with Quiver Gaming Mats.\nFor the past two years we have been developing the most premier tabletop gaming mats and playmats ever created.\nOur initial idea of being able to transform any table into an enhanced gaming surface was one of the first of its kind, and our initial campaign was met with great success and pivotal in founding our company. Now we\u2019ve taken this idea and went a step further to make our mats even better, developing our own proprietary material that was designed exclusively with tabletop gaming in mind.\nThere are a lot of materials used for playmats and other mats in the marketplace, but we wanted to recreate a professional gaming table surface that was portable, convenient, and would be available for a fraction of the cost. No more computer mouse pads - this is tabletop gaming!\nSupreme quality gaming suede | High density foam | Rubber backing\nEnter Quiver Gaming Gear's exclusively designed material: High quality, top of the line gaming suede, mounted to high density foam with a rubber backing, that can be dye sublimated to display the highest detailed imagery.\nThis mat has all the features you would find on the highest quality gaming table, but gives you the flexibility of design, options for size, and the benefit of portability so you can take your gaming table anywhere. No need to have an extra room in your house or spend thousands of dollars. Transform your existing table or any table into a gaming table!  \nThe Quiver Mat vs. The Other Mats\nWhat's the Quiver Mat Difference?\nThis is probably the biggest hurdle in helping others understand our mats. By default, since this is a mat, people gravitate to comparing it to other mats on the market. There are a wide range of them available, some made with very low quality materials, others slightly better. They vary in top surface, density, and some other forms of composition, but usually the \"economy fabric bonded to low density rubber composites\" is what you typically will find. Everything from yoga mats, floor mats, to mouse pads have been used and marketed as gaming mats. They mimic certain aspects of what you would find playing on a gaming table surface, but never quite hit the full experience. None have ever been completely designed with tabletop gaming in mind.\nThis is where our mats come in. This is a professional gaming table experience. Do a quick search for gaming tables, and you will see it's hard to find one with a professional grade surface for under $1000. And the low end ones in this group use felt or another economical surface as the material topper.\nIf you are looking at comparing these mats with other mats on the market, you are making the wrong comparison. These mats are a whole new league of their own, as they provide the experience of a professional grade gaming table without having to spend thousands of dollars.\nThis was a perfect solution for us as we:\n1) Didn't have the space for another table in our home\n 2) Could not afford a gaming table (or for that matter the proper size you would need to double as a dining table) \n3) Would give us the experience of a gaming table we can take anywhere &\n 4) Offer the flexibility of design choices for playing various games. \nAn accessory you will use for each and every game you play that makes every game better. The best gaming experience, and enjoy your game nights even more!\nQuiver Standard Mat | Light of Knight design\nMaybe you already have a gaming table?  Our mats give you the freedom to enjoy gaming wherever you want, so you can have that amazing gaming surface with you anywhere you go. Simply roll up your mat and take it with you to a friend's house, convention, or on vacation.\nCome and be part of the first playmats and gaming mats of their kind, and take your gaming to a whole new level. \nFollow the full story in our updates!\nQuiver Gaming Gear history and birth of our second generation mats\nThe selection of the gaming surface\nThe difference between the 1st generation and 2nd generation mat\nIs this more like a mat or a gaming table?\n  Our mats are proudly made in the USA with the highest quality materials and craftsmanship, from start to finish.  Producing our mats domestically gives us close proximity to quality control and will expedite manufacturing and order fulfillment.\nEach mat ordered will come in its own retail packaging which can be kept and used as a storage box.\nExample of retail packaging box. Final color and design TBD.\nWe have several options and mats available in this campaign to best fit your gaming needs:\nQuiver Arrow ($1) - Add an arrow to the Quiver and get updates all along the way! \nQuiver Play ($45) - Our smallest mat, at standard playmat size.  The perfect fit for living and collectable card games.  1 player {14\" x 24\" | 35 cm x 61 cm}\nQuiver Light ($129) - An excellent choice for a square or round table.  Themed designs available for miniature games.  2-4 players {36\" x 36\" | 91 cm x 91 cm}\nQuiver Standard ($135) - Our most popular selection. Plenty of surface for 4-6 players that will fit most any table.  {36\" x 48\" | 91 cm x 121 cm}\nQuiver SE (Standard Extended) ($179) - By popular demand! Get the extra length of the Shield for smaller width tables. {36\" x 60\" | 91 cm x 152 cm}\nQuiver Shield ($189) - Cover everything with this exceptional oversized mat.  Give your table the full makeover. 6-8+ players {40\" x 60\" | 101 cm x 152 cm}\nMats are guaranteed to have no more than a +/- 1/8\" margin of error in cut size in either direction.\nQuiver Standard Mat | Light of Knight design\n  1) Lower price - We are offering these mats near wholesale prices in this campaign.  As a backer, this is our thanks to you for helping make this product a reality and to encourage you to back.  International backers from the EU, Canada, and Australia benefit with friendly shipping for the campaign, too!\n2) You will get your mat well before it is available on the market - Our primary goal in this campaign is to gather enough funds to manufacture this material and deliver mats to our backers.  You will be first and the priority in this process.\n3) Unknown availability post campaign - As with any new product, pending on demand, manufacturing, and logistics, it can take some time to get a product set up for distribution.  Our second goal is to make these exceptional mats readily available for everyone post Kickstarter, but we need to have enough funds beyond our funding goal to produce additional mats.  If this doesn't happen on a scale where this works, or demand exceeds supply from the extra printed, it could take some significant time before additional mats are available.  Backing now ensures you will get a mat.\n4) Make your gaming the best it can be - You've been playing on a plain table for way too long.  Get a portable solution for your gaming travels. Protect your games and make your gaming even better!\n5) This product would not be able to exist without your pledge - Tackling a project like this takes a significant amount of time, energy, and funding.  Years have been put into this idea and product, and the only thing left is the capital to make it happen.  Every pledge will help this product become a staple accessory and the new highest standard for playmats and gaming mats.\nOur mats are available in the following designs for each size (Quiver play, Quiver Light, Quiver Standard, Quiver Shield):\n  Light of Knight\n  Don Burgundy\n  Fields of the Fallen\n  Stay on Target\n  It's a Trap!\nThe following mat is available in Quiver Play size ONLY (14\" x 24\"):\nModern Gameplay\nDesigns will be chosen AFTER the campaign has ended through a survey for your reward.   \nShipping is included for free with your pledge for backers in the USA.  The actual shipping cost of a playmat is around $10, and the larger gaming mats $20.  For countries outside the USA, these costs have been subsidized out of your actual shipping charges.  When you pledge for a specific mat, it will automatically calculate shipping to your country and add it to the pledge amount.\nOur mats will be shipped from within the USA, Canada, Australia, and the EU to reduce shipping charges, custom fees, and VAT taxes to backers in these areas.  Since our mats are manufactured in the USA, they will be shipped in bulk to fulfillment centers, and then fulfilled.  \nSnakes & Lattes (Canada), Spainbox (EU), and Aetherworks (Australia/New Zealand) will be our fulfillment partners for this project.\nIf you live outside of the USA, Canada, Australia, and the EU, additional import fees and taxes may apply upon receipt.  Check with your local postal provider for rates.\nIf your country is not listed as an option for pledging, please message us to calculate your rate and we can include it in a pledge level. International shipping from the USA will be sent USPS Priority International.\nUSA:\nYou may add on any number of additional mats for the following amounts to your pledge (shipping included):\nQuiver Play: $45\nQuiver Light: $129\nQuiver Standard: $135\nQuiver SE (Standard Extended): $179\nQuiver Shield: $189\nSimply click \"manage my pledge\" on the project page, and change your pledge amount to the total for the number of mats you are ordering.  You will select your mats and art choices in the survey after the campaign ends.\nAll other countries:\nYou may add additional mats at the above prices; however, additional shipping fees will be invoiced after the campaign based on actual costs incurred.  Australia and European backers will also be invoiced for the additional VAT or Goods and Service Tax (GST) based on selections, but this tax is based on the manufacturing cost, so it will be lower than the tax percentage of your total pledge amount.\nWe will do our best to get you lower rates for multiple orders through fulfillment, but you can plan on no more than the amount calculated and added during your pledge for your country for the mat selected.\nDue to shipping restrictions with size, pre-packaging, and logistics, we are unable to provide multiple discounted mat pledge levels.\nSome of our prototype mats were featured at Geekway to the West this year for Stonemaier Games.  While this was not the final thickness of the product, many gamers had the opportunity to play on the premium surface and see the high detail art from Viticulture, Between Two Cities, and Scythe. \nThe following reviewers have also received a prototype mat for review purposes.  Click on the header to be taken to the full review:\n\"Whoah, that thing is amazing!\" - Theology of Games\n Firestone--I was a big fan of the first-generation mat. I used it for close to two years, and never took it off my table. But I love the new mats. The biggest different for me is the surface itself. The felt was fine, and let you grab cards easily. But this new surface is smoother and sleeker, but doesn't feel like a mouse pad--it's still got more...character, I guess.\nJeremiah--Truly. Don't get me wrong, I LOVED the first Quiver mat. But this new one blew my mind. As nice as the first one is, the surface is a bit coarse. It makes it more durable for sure, but the surface on the new one... Wow! It's like playing on a cloud!\nFirestone's Final Verdict--These Quiver Gaming mats are a great way to upgrade a gaming table--or just protect one. I can't see any reason not to leave my mat on indefinitely. It muffles dice, it's nice and soft, and it looks great. Thanks for re-engineering these mats, Quiver. I love mine!\nJeremiah's Final Verdict--If you're perfectly happy playing on a plain hard table surface, or a table cloth (blah!) you are living a lie! Pick up a Quiver and get a taste of the good life--a little taste of the glory. The new suede surface is pure gaming luxury! I would sleep on mine if it was big enough!\n\"I've been using the first-gen mat for 2 years, and I really love it...This version is even better\" - Jonathan H. Liu\n  \"Love the finish...Love the look...love playing on it...really thrilled with it, very big thumbs up. Something I intend to use for a very long time.\" - Zee Garcia, The Dice Tower\n  Podcast Interview\n   \"A very cool gaming accessory...very striking.\" - Richard Ham, Rahdo Runs Through\n          Special Thanks to the Elevators for providing their music for our project video: \n                                                                           ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our second Kickstarter project, and we successfully delivered our first mats to over 500 backers.

Please see the updates for the most recent Tak news. Thank you!\n(Crazy Martin set with Arcanist's Board)\n \"Tak is the best sort of game: simple in its rules, complex in its strategy. Bredon beat me handily in all five games we played, but I am proud to say that he never beat me the same way twice.\" -Kvothe\nNews Flash: We've cracked the $1M mark and added two big upgrades to the campaign: An alternate Tavern-style game board on the back of the main board, and a Kickstarter-exclusive Vintas Royal Capstone. Read about them both in Update #17.\nQuestions? They might be answered in Update #18.\nTak is a new 2-player strategy game invented by James Ernest and Patrick Rothfuss. It was introduced in Patrick Rothfuss' book The Wise Man's Fear, Day 2 of the Kingkiller Chronicle. \nTak is a pure abstract game in the same family as chess, go, and mancala. Our goal was to design a new game with a sense of history; a beautiful game with simple rules and deep strategy. And we can't wait to share it with you!\nThis campaign has plenty of interesting pieces, and we aren't done adding more. This is a quick top-level list of all the items, with their add-on pricing. Below that is a quick list of the levels and what they contain.\nLevel Rewards at a Glance\nBacker Shadowstalker did us a favor, sharing a Google Doc that lets you figure out exactly what to pledge for any assortment of goodies. Once the pledge manager opens, you'll be able to add items to your pledge, or allocate extra money you've already pledged. \nThe Rewards: \nAll of these items are described in detail later on this page. The price is the cost to add the item to your pledge, but shipping is not included. That will be calculated in the Pledge Manager.\nCompanion Book: $15\nCompanion Book (E-Book): $5\nTavern Set (44 pcs): $25\nClassic Set (62 pcs, board, box, rules): $55\nCollector Coin: $5\nVintas Royal Capstone: $5\nCloth Board: $9\nArcanist's Board (Simple Wooden Board): $65\nCrazy Martin Piece Pack (44 pcs): $35\nTak Pairs Deck: $10\nDevi's Box (Deluxe set by Wyrmwood): $475\nDevi's Board (Lid from Devi's Box): $175\nThe Levels: \nAll pledge levels at $5 and above give you access to the Pledge Manager. Shortly after the campaign, we will invite you to the Pledge Manager, which will allow you to give us your shipping information, and to allocate any additional funds in your pledge.\nPATRON: $5. Access to Pledge Manager (only)\nSTUDENT: $15. Companion Book\nMERCENARY: $25. Tavern Set\nTROUPER: $40. Tavern Set and Companion Book\nMERCHANT: $55. Classic Set \nINNKEEPER: $65. Classic Set and Companion Book\nTINKER'S PACK: $90. Classic, Tavern, Book, and Coin\nARCANIST'S PACK: $155. Tinker's Pack plus Arcanist's Board\nGAELET'S PACK: $250. Tinker's Pack plus Devi's Board\nDEVI'S BOX: $475. Devi's Box, a handcrafted hardwood set, Book\nMONEYLENDER'S PACK: $550. Tinker's Pack plus Devi's Box\nNew at $1 Million: Higher value pledge levels starting with the Merchant also include one Vintas Royal Capstone (see Update 17).\nFor more about add-ons, please check out the refresher in Update #15.\nTak uses a square board, which can be any size from 3x3 up to 8x8, but the most common sizes are 5x5 and 6x6 (the \"Tavern\" and \"Classic\" games).\nEach player has several matching pieces, or \"stones,\" and one special piece called the \"Capstone.\" The Capstone can be any shape, and the other pieces should be simple, stackable pieces in a matching style.\nThe board starts empty, and the goal is to build a road (a connected string of your pieces) connecting opposite sides of the board.\nOn each turn, you will either place a piece in an empty space, or move a stack that you control. Stacks must move in a straight line, dropping pieces as they go, and possibly covering other pieces along the way.\nYou can play a piece upright. This piece is called a \"standing stone,\" or \"wall.\" It can't be part of a road, but other pieces can't stack on top of it. \nThe Capstone is your power piece. It can be part of a road, it can't be stacked on, and it can also flatten standing stones.\nYou can read the complete rules at our Tak information page. There's a short how to play video here. You can also watch Patrick and James discuss the development of the game (and watch them play it) in this video from Emerald City Comic Con. \nHere are more details on the pledge levels described in the right sidebar, and the items they contain. (Note: None of the designs for art, game pieces, or boards, are final.)\nPatron: If you'd just like to help out, you can contribute $5 at the Patron level. This level also grants you access to our pledge manager, where you can add individual items to your pledge. (Note: If you want the E-Book alone, which will have a retail price of $10, you can pledge at the $5 Patron level and add another $5 for the E-Book.)\nStudent: At the $15 level, you'll receive the hardcover Tak companion book, tentatively titled Tak: A Beautiful Game. This book will be written by James Ernest and Patrick Rothfuss and illustrated by Nate Taylor. Included in the book are game rules, strategy hints, a 5x5 game board on the back cover (designed by Pete Venters, see Update 16), a description of Tak's history in Temerant, and more.\nTak is an ancient and well-traveled game, with many variations and styles of play. The companion book will touch on the game's origins, and will explain the ancestry and meaning of various types of pieces. It will contain an expanded rules section describing regional game variations, as well as strategy hints and terms for various plays and combinations. \nMany of our stretch goals add more content to this book, including full rules for precursor games such as Kaen, specific rules and piece designs for various places in Temerant, and much more!\nMercenary: At the $25 level, you will receive the Tavern Set, a compact set of 44 wooden pieces, which is enough for a 5x5 game. The Tavern Set is designed for portability, and includes a drawstring bag. The Mercenary level will also include a one-page rules sheet, but no board.\nTrouper: At the $40 level, you will receive both the Tavern Set and companion book. Because the book contains the rules, and has a 5x5 board on the back, this level contains everything you need to play.\nThe Tavern Set is based on the Tak sets you'd find in a traveler's pack. The pieces are made of white birch, stained with a natural and walnut finish. They measure approximately 20mm square and 8mm thick, with 25mm turned wood capstones. It comes with a simple drawstring bag, with enough extra room for a few coins to pay your tab.  \nThe Tavern Set fits in a large pocket or small purse. If you back at the Mercenary level, which does not come with a board, it's easy to print or draw one. Or you can just play without a board, by marking the center space with a coin.\nMerchant: At the $55 level, you'll receive the Classic Set: 62 wooden pieces, a full-sized 6x6 game board, and the complete game rules.\nWe called this level the \"Merchant,\" in part, because this is exactly the version that will be offered to retail stores. \nMillion Dollar Update: Backers at this level and higher will also receive a Vintas Royal Capstone, which will not be available in stores, or anywhere else! See the Royal Capstone description below, and in Update 17.\nInnkeeper: At the $65 level, you'll receive the Classic Set and the companion book.\nThe Classic Set contains a mix of two common piece shapes: the \"Merchant\" set (trapezoids) and the \"Cane\" set (flat-bottomed circles.) You can read more about these shapes in Update #9.\nThe board in the Classic Set will be a 10\" square 6x6 \"hybrid\" game board, which is a unique design with diamonds and squares that can be used for any size game between 3x3 and 6x6. This board will be designed by illustrator Echo Chernik (See her early sketches in Update 16 and Update 17).\nMillion Dollar Update: The board will now have two sides: A florid Court-style board design on the front, and a rugged Tavern-style board on the back. Again, early information on this is in Update 17.\nThe board will be a single non-folding piece, an 80 pt tag (cardboard) with a full-color linen finish wrapper and art on both sides, illustrated by Echo Chernik. In other words, a very nice game board.\nTinker's Pack: At the $90 level, you'll receive everything described above: the Classic Set, the companion book, and the Tavern Set. We will also include a handsome Tak collector coin.\nAbout the Coin: Cheapass Games makes a new collector coin with each Kickstarter campaign. They are usually round, but this coin will be a 36 mm square (approx. 42\" on the diagonal). This coin is ideal as a centerpiece, allowing you to play Tak without a board!\nThe coin will be pierced in one corner, so you can add a jump ring and make it into a pendant or keychain. Like all our previous collector coins, this one will be made by our friends at Campaign Coins. You can add the collector coin to any pledge for $5.\nArcanist's Pack: At the $155 level, you will receive everything in the Tinker's Pack, plus the Arcanist's Board, a 10\" engraved wooden board. This board is a 6x6 hybrid design (diamonds and squares), made from cherry-veneered MDF. You can read more about the Arcanist's Board in Update #6.\nThe Arcanist's Board is also available as an add-on for $65.\nDevi's Board is the lid from Devi's Box (below). This is a deluxe double-sided Tak board, with a hybrid 6x6 design on one side, and a traditional 6x6 design on the other. Like Devi's Box, it is made by the folks at Wyrmwood, handcrafted from maple, walnut, and bloodwood. \nDevi's Board is available as part of the Gaelet's Pack, which also includes everything in the Tinker's Pack, for $250. This board can also be added to any pledge for $175.\nLike Devi's Box below, Devi's Board will be available only through this campaign, and will be a limited edition (though it will not be numbered). This is a board only, with no pieces or box.  \nDevi's Box is an heirloom-quality Tak set, handcrafted by our friends at Wyrmwood. Devi\u2019s Box is a complete game, including board, box, and pieces for a 6x6 game. The box and pieces are made from maple and walnut, with a touch of bloodwood. \nThe lid is a double-sided game board (also available by itself, see Devi's Board above), with a hybrid 6x6 game board on one side, and a traditional 6x6 board on the other. The pieces are maple and bloodwood, with turned capstones. You can find more details on Devi\u2019s Box in Update #12. There is also a short Devi's Box presentation video from Wyrmwood.\nThe Devi\u2019s Box pledge level includes Devi\u2019s Box and the Tak companion Book, for $475. You can also add Devi's box to any pledge level for the same price of $475.\nThe Moneylender\u2019s Pack pledge level includes Devi\u2019s Box, as well as everything in the Tinker\u2019s Pack: the Tavern Set, Classic Set, companion book, and coin, for $550.\nNotes: Devi\u2019s Box will be a numbered, limited edition, available only to Kickstarter backers. It will be available as an add-on for $475, but only while supplies last. We will set the production quantity once the pledge manager has been open for one month. \nOther Things: As you know, we have researched many interesting accessories for Tak during this campaign. Not all of them became reality, either because they didn't work out, or because they required additional research. The items we still want to pursue include a set of cast stone pieces, a handsome set of metal capstones, and alternate art boards by some of the finest artists in the business. \nEven though we didn't get to everything in this campaign, you can be sure that Tak will be popular for a long time to come, and we will have many chances to bring you new and amazing accessories for this beautiful game.\nBelow is a list of some additional items that are not part of any pledge level. If you'd like to add any of these items to your pledge, you can do so by increasing your pledge amount, or you can upgrade your pledge through our pledge manager after the campaign is over.\nFor more details on the workings of the pledge manager, please read Update #4.\nCloth Board: This is a simple 14\" bandanna, printed with a unique Tak board designed by Doctor Lucky himself, BJ Becker. Excellent for pairing with the Tavern Set or Crazy Martin. This board was introduced in Update #14 and you can add it to your pledge for $9.\nThe Crazy Martin Piece Pack: This item was introduced in Update #4. It's a set of 44 pieces (21 pieces and one capstone per side) matching the pieces in the Classic Set. That's enough for a 5x5 game by itself, but it's also enough to upgrade the 6x6 Classic Set into a game as large as 8x8. (Of course, you'll have to find an 8x8 board. This should not be hard) You can add the Crazy Martin Piece Pack for $35.\nTak Pairs Deck: If you like Pairs, and you like Tak, here's a fun crossover game. Pairs is a pub game with a bunch of variations and lots of different theme decks. It was Cheapass Games' first collaboration with Patrick Rothfuss. You can add this Pairs deck for $10. \nThe deck will be drawn by Nate Taylor, and the artwork above should be considered extremely placeholder.\nVintas Royal Capstone: At the $1 million mark, we introduced this Kickstarter-exclusive Capstone, which we will now include free in the Merchant pledge level and higher. You can also add it to any pledge (Patron and higher) for $5.\nThe Vintas Royal Capstone will be similar to the prototype shown above, turned from white birch but stained in a medium natural wood color, possibly cherry (final color TBD). It is a single piece (not a set of two) and it will be available only to backers of this campaign. Show your opponents that you were here at the beginning! You can read more about it in Update 17.\nE-Book: You can add an electronic copy of the companion book to your pledge for $5. This e-book will eventually sell for $10, so if you want the e-book alone, you can pledge $5 for the Patron level, and add the extra $5 to get the e-book.\nNote that none of these add-on prices include shipping, because that cost will depend on where you are located, and what else is in your order. If we need to collect additional shipping, we can do it through the pledge manager. For more about shipping and the pledge manager, check out Update #4.\nWe have made several improvements to this campaign, listed below. Some of them are Stretch Goals, while others are just improvements that we unlocked when we figured out how to do them. As a group we're calling them \"Campaign Goals.\" As you know, we still have many great items in the works!\nUpgrade 1: Turned wood capstones in the Tavern Set. These were originally planned as simple cubes, but at 1200 sets it was worth the extra bump to add a more traditional turned capstone to the Tavern Set. Not really a stretch goal, but an upgrade for day 2.\nStretch Goal 1: Rules for Kaen, a Tak precursor game in the companion book. Kaen is an ancient gambling game that uses many of the same pieces from Tak. This is a new game by James Ernest and Patrick Rothfuss, unlocked at 2500 backers.\nNew Item 1: The Crazy Martin Piece Pack. This is like a jumbo-sized Tavern Set, a 44-piece kit matching the pieces in the Classic Set, which is enough for a 5x5 game itself, or up to an 8x8 game with the pieces in the Classic Set. Unlocked at the $310k miliestone. \nNew Item 2: E-Book version of the Companion Book: It seemed reasonable to offer the companion book in an electronic format, so on 4/22 we introduced it as an add-on for $5. \nNew Item 3: The Arcanist's Board. This solid wood board was introduced on 4/25, as the cornerstone of the Arcanist's Pack, and as a separate add-on. Read about it in Update #6.\nNew Item 4: Tak Pairs Deck. A crossover that makes more sense than a Pairs-themed Tak board (don't tempt us), this new Pairs deck by Nate Taylor is described in Update #7. Added at 4500 backers.\nUpgrade 2: We've hired Echo Chernik to design the game board! Echo is an insanely talented illustrator and we are thrilled to have her designing the board in the Classic Set.\nStretch Goal 2: Tak and the Edema Ruh. A section in the companion Book with alternate rules and piece types for the Ruh. Unlocked at 3 Achievement Points.\nStretch Goal 3: Tak in Tarbean: Customs and gambling rules from this bustling city. Unlocked at 6 Achievement Points.\nStretch Goal 4: Tak at the University. Variant piece designs, alternate rules, and a different set of gambling rules for the University players. Unlocked at 10 Achievement Points. \nNew Items 5 and 6: Devi's Board and Devi's Box: Introduced during Week 3, these deluxe Tak items are created by the craftsmen at Wyrmwood. \nStretch Goal 5: Tak at the Eolian. This special stretch goal brings us a new traditional Tak song, created by Molly Lewis.\nNew Item 7: Cloth Board. A simple 14\" bandanna printed with a unique organic Tak board, introduced on May 12 as a $9 add-on.\nStretch Goal 6: Tak in Fae. Piece designs and board artwork among the Faen.\nStretch Goal 7: Tak Puzzles: A few fun tak puzzles for the companion book, created by Ira Fay.\nStretch Goal 8: Tak in Alveron's Court: More details about the games between Bredon and Kvothe.\nStretch Goal 9: Rules for Locke, another precursor game to Tak. This one isn't much like Tak at all... but we love to make games! \nStretch Goals 10 and 11: At $1M, we unlocked the twin goals of a second board design in the Classic Set, and a Kickstarter-only \"Royal Vintas Capstone.\" Read about both in Update 17. \nStretch Goal 12: Tak in Adem.

Each player controls one of the worlds surrounding a star facing annihilation. For centuries these worlds have been living in utopia, fed by the seemingly boundless energy drawn from their star through a lattice of solar harvesting infrastructure. Suddenly this infrastructure is destroyed and their worlds are cast into darkness, their inhabitants facing imminent extinction. \nAmidst the clamor, each world has built an Ark housing some small fraction of their population. Each Ark is now waiting at the edge of the solar system for the energy required to attain escape velocity before the final devastation hits. Unfortunately, the only possible source of such a great deal of energy is the dying star itself.  \nIn the game, each player will be launching sundivers to rebuild just enough of the lost solar infrastructure needed to harvest and transmit energy back to their waiting Arks. In a final twist of irony, the process of extracting this energy will further compound the solar instability and hasten their Sun's ultimate demise.\nSol: Last Days of a Star is the culmination of two brothers' lifetime passion for games, two and half years of development, hundreds of playtests, beautiful art and fascinating, unique mechanics.\nSol: Last Days of a Star\n  From above\n      Beyond making a great game with elegant rules and emergent strategic depth, we also wanted to create a work of art. \n(some components pictured are from prior prototypes)\n  (component designs not final)\n  Momentum Track and Instability Spiral\nWorld-Specific Components (total for all 5 worlds):\n145 plastic player pieces\n5 Player Boards\n5 Player Aids\n5 Motherships\n5 Arks\n65 Sundivers\n25 Solar Gates\n15 Energy Nodes\n15 Sundiver Foundries\n15 Transmission Towers\n5 Clear Movement Trackers\nMothership\n  Solar Gate\n  Energy Node\n  Sundiver Foundry\n  Transmission Tower\n  Sundiver\n  Interstellar Ark\n  Game in Progress\n  In the Core of the Sun\n      Shared Infrastructure\nIn many games, each player builds their own infrastructure and uses their own buildings and abilities, which can lead to an isolated game experience. In Sol, everyone shares infrastructure. If you build a gate to a deeper layer of the Sun, other players can cross it. If you build a node, foundry or tower, other players can activate it. The activator gets a reward, but the owner gets a bonus as well, so building infrastructure creates potential for recurring rewards throughout the game. This leads to a whole new dimension of considerations as you weigh how much you will use a station or gate and positioning it so that you get maximum benefit from other players using it as well.\nOrbiting Mothership\nYour Mothership is your base of operations and where all of your sundivers launch onto the board. Because the motherships are always moving, you will drift farther away from your own structures and draw closer to the things other players have built, encouraging everyone to use everyone else's infrastructure. That is, until you come full circle and arrive back at where you started. These cycles of timing provide endless variety to the gameplay.\nInstability Effects\nThe other source of variability is the Instability Effects. Before every game a mix of Instability Effects are chosen which change the feel and potential of the game. Each Instability Effect is a rule or ability that enhances what players are able to do on their turn \u2014 things like teleporting sundivers or moving stations across the board. This means each game has different potential strategies to discover and approaches to explore, and that every game will be unique!\n    The current rulebook is here! http://elephantlaboratories.com/sol-rulebook.pdf (not final) and the BGG entry is here: https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/174837/sol-last-days-star. Also, at the bottom of this section is a \"How to Play\" video with the designers.\nGreen player's perspective\nSol: Last Days of a Star can be played by 1 - 5 players. The game board shows the Sun as it is poised to go supernova. \n5 player setup\nEach player has a mothership in orbit which is where they will launch sundivers onto the board.  The motherships follow an orbital track around the perimeter of the game board, moving one space each turn, so your sundivers will emerge in different places on the board throughout the game.\nLaunching sundivers on to the board (prototype components)\nOn your turn you can either move sundivers around the board, convert sundivers into nodes, foundries, towers or gates, or activate those structures to receive different rewards. These include harvesting energy from the energy nodes, building new sundivers at the sundiver foundries, or transmitting energy back to your Ark at the transmission towers. This energy is converted into momentum, which will ultimately determine who escapes to salvation and who is left behind.\nMove, Convert or Activate!\n  Actions you can take in the game\nAs stations are converted and activated they cause increasing instability in the Sun, which will ultimately trigger the supernova and the end of the game. The deeper the stations are positioned into the layers of the Sun the more of a reward they yield when activated \u2014 but also the greater instability they cause. All infrastructure is shared, with activators getting a base amount of the reward and the owner of the station receiving a bonus. Timing will play a crucial role as you weigh all of the tradeoffs between building shallow or deep, investing in your own infrastructure or using another player's.\nReward by layer for activators and owners\nAs players convert and activate in the Sun, they will draw cards representing instability. Each time a solar flare is drawn, the marker on the Instability Spiral is advanced. When the 13th solar flare is drawn, the Sun goes supernova, and whoever's Ark has made it furthest away will escape in time, and the rest will be consumed in a fiery demise.\nMomentum Track and Instability Spiral\nEvery game will also feature a different mix of Instability Effects chosen at the beginning of the game. These effects will add new abilities and encourage different strategies, making every game feel unique.\nInstability Effects, chosen at the beginning of the game\n Here is a good primer on how to play Sol: Last Days of a Star \n      Enjoying Sol: Last Days of a Star\n\"I always say there's nothing new in board games, but the way Sol plays makes me feel like some core mechanics are so fresh that I've never seen them before -- and Sol's game play is not just new; it's intriguing and exciting.\" - Anthony J Gallela, Game Developer and Chair of the KublaCon Game Design Contest\n\"As I delved into the mechanics of the game I realized this was something kind of special... Even though the game has a very very simple ruleset it's deceptively deep and deceptively complex.\" - Lance Myxter, Undead Viking\n\"I have literally played Sol dozens of times, and quite frankly it never gets old. The variability in the rule set, built on a solid base, allows me as a game master to adapt the game to the group that is playing\"- Chad Nichols, Dungeon Master at Geekline 415\n\"Intense and nailbiting to the very end.\" - Andrew Tullsen, Founder of Print and Play Productions\n\"Sol has some real meat on its bones and an underlying elegance that made it a standout at BGG.con. I can't wait to get this to the table again!\" - Mischa D. Krilov, Board Game Hero\n\"Sol: Last Days of a Star effortlessly blends theme with mechanics, providing a rich and unique play experience. This game is good on so many levels but what really makes it shine is the dynamic player interaction driven by the shared use of space stations, warp bridges and solar harvesters. No player can win on their own, but only one will succeed in escaping solar annihilation.\" - Tim Eisner, Weird City Games, Designer of March of the Ants\n\"Sol is great! You are constantly trying to plan the perfect set of moves while balancing that with an ever changing board.\" - Chase Van Epps, Print and Play Productions\n\"The beauty of Sol is that the players build the board together, opening new strategies each game.

Now they are designing the games they want to play that don't yet exist.\nJodi and Ryan winning the Silver Kubla! (super old prototype)\nJodi Sweetman has spent a great deal of her time wrangling artists and creatives of all types to produce tangible, finished products. Her expertise and guidance in orchestrating the great project that is Sol is the key that brought this project from a cool prototype to a working product.\nLooking sharp\nMark Dusk is a designer and artist in Portland, OR. Inspired by playing a prototype of Sol one day at Ryan's house, he lead the creation of the visual incarnation of the game. \nJon at Gencon\nJon Mietling of Portal Dragon met Ryan and Jodi at GenCon 2015.

For us this is a dream years in the making, but we know this can make potential backers nervous, which is why we have gone through a huge amount of preparation to make sure we are going about it the right way. \n\nFirst, we have made sure the game is solid. After hundreds of play tests with hundreds of different people and countless hours of development and refinement we are confident this game is fun and endlessly replayable. We care about the depth of gameplay emerging from elegant and streamlined rules. We have worked hard to make a clear and concise rulebook so players can dive into playing, and we have iterated on the player aids so that it is immediately clear what options players have on their turn. \n\nSecond, we have sought out guidance and advice from designers and publishers who have been through the Kickstarter process before. We have been in contact with the manufacturer for over a year now planning out all of the details of production. We have researched shipping options to make sure that every game arrives on time and unscathed. \n\nThat said, issues are sure to arise, and we have no reason to believe that the countless lessons we have learned up until this point will stop once the project is funded.

We understand the responsibilities and dedication that is required to run a business, and are ready to tackle any unforeseen challenges that could occur along the way. Our primary risks at this point lie in manufacturing and shipping. \n\nWe have established a solid relationship with WinGo Games, a reputable manufacturer that is trusted within the industry. We have ensured that all of our questions have been answered ahead of time, so we know exactly what to expect from WinGo, and WinGo knows what to expect from us as well. \n\nWe will work diligently on our end to ensure the final art and graphic files are completed and delivered on time, and according to WinGo's specifications as to avoid potential delays and other issues. There are some things that will be out of our hands during the manufacturing process, such as labor force fluctuations, Chinese holidays, etc. We have taken those things into consideration, and have given ourselves an extra cushion of time for things that could occur beyond our control. \n\nWe have carefully planned our logistics, and have established correspondence with fulfillment companies around the world, which we feel confident in handling our shipments from the factory to your doorstep when that time comes. \n\nGetting this game in your hands and in perfect condition, within the stated delivery time is our primary focus and concern.

It estimates safe sun time based on the user\u2019s location, severity of local UV radiation and skin type that make it perfect for helping people safely spend time outdoors.\nQTemp is an awesome gadget with a companion app that helps you make your life healthier and more comfortable. We designed QTemp to be simple, convenient and durable.\nCompatible with all smartphones\nWe believe technology should make our lives simpler. QTemp is easy to set up and use. Just tap QTemp on or pair QTemp-i with your smartphone. \nQTemp-i\nQTemp-i continuously measures UV and temperature and transmits them to your smartphone via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) connectivity based on the reading interval. The safe sun time will be adjusted based on the updated readings. It should face to the main source of UV to get the most accurate result. \nQTemp-i has a replaceable regular coin cell battery (CR2032). Battery lifetime depends on the frequency of measurements.

If your smartphone doesn\u2019t support NFC, choose QTemp-i.\nEasily tap QTemp on your NFC enable devices (Android, BlackBerry and Windows Phone).\nQTemp or QTemp-i?\nBoth devices use the same sensors for measuring UV index and temperature, their function is completely similar. There are 3 main differences between QTemp and QTemp-i: \n1- Transferring data: QTemp-i uses Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) connectivity, so it is compatible with both iOS and Android devices; However, QTemp communicates with smartphones via Near Field Communication (NFC) Technology, a feature that iPhone doesn\u2019t support. \n 2- Power: QTemp-i requires a battery although QTemp is battery-free. It's a passive device and harvests energy from your smartphone. \n 3- Continuously measuring: QTemp-i can continuously measure and transfer data based on the reading interval. Data can be stored in on-board memory even when your smartphone is not connected to QTemp-i. However, QTemp is a passive gadget. Once you tap it on your smartphone, it measures and transfers data.\nDifference between QTemp-i and QTemp\nIf you are an iPhone user, select the 'Kickstarter Special' (QTemp-i) or 'TWO QTemp-i' perk.\nQTemp estimates how long you can stay outdoors before getting sunburned or developing skin damage. The calculation is based on:\n1. Measured UV index specific to users' location in real time.\n2. Environmental factors affect a person's UV exposure. Urban area, snow, green space, water and sand (beach or desert) reflect UV and increase exposure.\n3. Users' skin type based on the Fitzpatrick skin type.\nQTemp app helps you to identify your skin type based on the Fitzpatrick Skin Type\nPLAY\n\nQTemp gives you complete and accurate weather data to help you lead a healthier and more comfortable lifestyle. It provides recommendations based on the weather data and alerts you to protect your skin when safe sun time is over.\nMost people associate UV with warm temperature; however, UV rays hit people on cold days as well. QTemp is an ideal source of protection for people living in high-temperature or snowy locations or for those \u2018seeking the sun\u2019 during vacations. It is particularly useful for parents and young people, in addition to people with sensitive skin. \nQTemp fits comfortably on a key-ring. It can be as discreet or as visible as you want it to be. It is rain, splash and water-resistant. You can wear it all day, every day.\nStick QTemp on both sides of window, know the indoor and outdoor temperature and UV with just two taps via NFC technology.\nPrevent Harmful UV Rays\n1 in 5 Americans, 1 in 7 Canadians and 2 in 3 Australians are developing skin cancer in their lives, mostly because of overexposure to the sun. Therefore, we need new tools to identify and implement effective strategies that improve sun-protective behaviors. The aim of QTemp is to help people lead healthier lifestyles by preventing them from being overexposed to harmful UV rays.

A moderate degree of UV exposure is necessary for the production of Vitamin D, which is essential for bone health. However, excessive exposure to UV radiation is associated with different types of sunburn, accelerated skin aging, cataracts and other eye diseases and skin cancers. Children and adolescents are particularly vulnerable to the harmful effects of UV radiation. According to the Skin Cancer Foundation, even one bad sunburn as a baby, child, or young adult, can increase risk over time. \nAccording to the Skin Cancer Foundation website about 2.8, 0.7 and 0.07 million are diagnosed with BCC, SCC and melanoma each year in the US.\nEven though UV rays make up only a very small portion of the sun\u2019s rays, they are the main cause of the sun\u2019s damaging effects on the skin. Many factors affect the UV intensity, which subsequently alters the UV index. This then affects the amount of time that you can spend in the sun before starting to burn.\nWhile both UVA and UVB rays can harm the skin and lead to skin cancers, UVB (cause of getting sunburned), is effectively blocked by glass. However, at least 50% of UVA radiation (which accelerates aging) can pass through windows. According to the Skin Cancer Foundation, car windows have been proven to let in more than 60%.\nA 35-year-old melanoma survivor\u2019s skin under normal light and UV light.\nIn the late winter and early spring, snow reflects up to 80% of the UV light from the sun, meaning that you are often hit by the same rays twice. That's why you need to protect your eyes and wear sun glasses on a snowy day. In the spring and fall, UV radiation from the sun can be very strong, especially in the spring when ozone depletion is of concern. Also, UV rays can bounce off surfaces like water, sand, snow, pavement, or grass, leading to an increase in UV exposure. \nVelcro, magnet and double sided tape will allow you to place QTemp on any surface.\n How do I get the mount?\nFor existing backers: Click \"Manage My Pledge\" on the main project page and increase your existing pledge by C$5 (there are no additional shipping charges) \n For new backers: Add C$5 to the pledge amount for the device you want (eg, if you'd like a QTemp for C$25, pledge C$30) \n Indicate in the backer survey following the campaign that you've pledged an extra C$5 to have a mount included with your QTemp or QTemp-i.  \nWe'll take care of the rest!\nThe perfect gift for tech lovers!\nWe started with a simple concept of improving people's health through analyzing weather data.

We created Tabletopia to bring the games and the players closer to each other with help of digital technology.\nThere is Kindle for books, and there is iTunes for music. Board games also need their own platform. So here we are! Tabletopia consists of: \nthe most advanced virtual table for gaming on PC, Mac, iOS and Android; \na database for matching players, public and private game tables, players ratings and reputation system etc.; \nthe workshop - a special editor to build your own games from scratch or port from standard graphics (no programming skills are required); \ntools for publishers and authors to playtest, demonstrate, promote and monetize their games.\nTabletopia is a sandbox. Players should know the rules of the game to play it. There is no AI or rules enforcement, but at the same time it has the freedom to play the game your way - exactly as if you were playing at a real table. However, we have done a lot to make each play for you a good experience: \nautomatic game setups, card dealing, drafting etc. \nplayer\u2019s turn control, timers, game phases indication \ninteractive zones on the table with predefined automatic actions \nintelligent counters for tracking victory points and many other in-game parameters \ncustom surfaces, game room wallpapers, sound effects advanced camera controls \u2026 and many other useful features!\nTabletopia is accessible from all perspectives. The basic version is free and is currently available for PC and MAC (browser based). Soon, we will launch a downloadable client on the Steam portal (first quarter of 2016) and then also add access for iOS and Android (second quarter of 2016).\nTabletopia was also featured in:\n\"Tabletopia is looking very promising, shaping up as the smoothest-looking and smoothest-playing digital board game platform available.\" - Game Salute\n\"Easy to setup and really intuitive to use by players.

Then add whatever you need from our extensive library of free game objects and sounds.\nYou will be able to create a digital implementation of your board game in a few hours without any programming skills. Then, decide what will happen to your game: \nput it in private mode (to playtest it only with your test group or demonstrate it to your chosen publishers) \nmake it public - to show it to the world, gather feedback or promote it \nplace it in the paid section of the game catalog to earn 70% from revenue generated by users (read more here)\nAs soon as the project goes to commercial release, there will be three levels of access for Players and three levels of access for Game Designers. Basic access for both groups will be free, but the most interesting games and system features will be for premium accounts. There are no additional fees per game \u2013 a silver (4,99) or gold (9,99) membership will give you access to the entire game catalogue (similar to how this is handled for music on Spotify).\nHere you can find more information about Virtual Gaming and Testing rooms, advanced Hot Seat mode and other Tabletopia\u2019s concepts.\n Please note than you can combine pledges for gamers and designers; just add the appropriate amount to your initial pledge.\nAnd what is for you - our backers?\nAll our backers will get access to KS only demos, news and updates, during and after the campaign, and a special \u201cfounder badge\u201d in Tabletopia forever. \nEarly access - some of our pledges will allow you to join us directly after the campaign is over (1st week of October) and others will be allowed to join one month before open beta (approx. 1st week of December). \nGreat discounts for subscriptions - from 17% to 33% less than the standard price.

Just spread the word about Tabletopia and follow us on Twitter and Facebook\nThe creation of Tabletopia started early in 2014, when Tim Bokarev \u2013 author of the concept of digital publishing platform for board games \u2013 invited his friends and partners Artem Zinoviev and Dmitry Sergeev to take part in the project. Artem and Dmitry are the creators of Playtox and have a lot of experience in the gaming business. Tim is known in Russia for different projects in the digital field (Promo Interactive, Next Media Group), but also actively participates in a board game business (Igrology game studio and Tesera.ru main boardgame portal in Russia).\nBy spring 2014 Artem, Dmitry and Tim created a company named Tabletopia Inc USA and started the development. The team was quickly assembled, and the project has been moving rapidly since. The main development team is located in Novosibirsk, Russia, but there are more people working on the project from Russia, Ukraine, USA and Germany.\nWe have a lot of plans for Tabletopia, and we are constantly strengthening our team. Until now, it has all been financed by the founders directly. And now we need the support from the gaming community to make the project better, and to prepare for the international public launch (December 2015). We have a lot of plans - like advanced game tutorials, PBEM and Hotseat play enhancements, customizable visual effects for game objects and many other features. Your help is essential to make our dream come true. Together, we can make the best digital board game experience ever!\n Follow us on                  Facebook                Twitter            Tabletopia blog", "risks": "Risks and challenges\n1.

We decided to cancel this campaign, as it was apparent we would not reach our funding goal. It is clear to us why we didn\u2019t reach our goal, which was a likely combination of several factors:\nTiming. The campaign started and ended in two of the statistically slowest months on Kickstarter. To top it off, many very popular and much anticipated tabletop games were also launching during this time, many of which were from highly successful publishers who already have a large following. Additionally, we launched right in the middle of the biggest game conventions in the U.S. (Origins, Dice Tower Con, and Gen Con), which can temporarily draw interest away from Kickstarter games.\nAmbitious goal. As a first time publisher who hasn\u2019t had a chance to build our crowd, our goal was too ambitious. We realize that our crowd-to-funding goal ratio needs to be improved, which can either be achieved by further building our crowd or lowering the goal. We can lower the goal by cutting some of the initial components back (while not affecting game play), and adding them back into the game via stretch goals.\nNot enough clarification. We found several things that we could have clarified better, one of those things being the rulebook. Having a more streamlined rulebook that clearly presents the more complex parts of the game in a way that is easy to understand, would allow potential backers to get a better sense of how to play the game without having to cross reference.  We also realize that since this is a 4X game, many potential backers want to know how it compares to other popular 4X sci-fi games in its category. Clarifying these differences was something we neglected to do in this campaign (at least from the beginning), which may have been a deterrent for some backers.\nArt. We feel that the alien art could be improved upon, or at least more in line with the style the intended audience wants to see for this type of game.\nDuring this campaign, we were actively listening to what backers had to say, and taking much of the suggestions and feedback into consideration in order to plan the best possible relaunch.\nThe improvements we will make with the relaunch include:\nA lower funding goal, in the $20K range.\nA lower price point for both the base game and Special Edition game.\nA major improvement to the rulebook which will include a beginner and advanced variant of the game. The new rulebook will be clear, organized, easy to understand, and accompanied by player aids. In addition, some of the components and graphic design elements will be cleaner and more intuitive.\nComparison with other 4X games which are similar, which will describe the differences in each game so you can easily decide if this game is for you.\nImproved alien art, which will be more in line with the styles of art in popular sci-fi games like Twilight Imperium, which will be more compelling and bring more flavor to the game.\nKickstarter Exclusive custom Alien Battle dice in every game.\nMore game play videos so you can get a better understanding of how to play the game.\nA few other things backers have suggested and recommended.\nFor more information you can visit the relaunch campaign, or subscribe to our e-newsletter here.\nYou can also follow/like us on Twitter/Facebook for more frequent updates and tidbits of information.\nYou can find lots of additional information including rulebook updates on BoardGameGeek, where we are actively involved in the forums and threads, and can answer any questions you might have about the game.\nThanks so much again to everyone who supported this project, you have all been amazing and we hope you can join us for the relaunch!

You may need to animate stone statues to fight off rampaging hordes, persuade an inspector that the academy is safe (and only slightly aflame) or tame a book that has learned to cast its own spells and delights in mayhem.\nEach game your capacities are semi-randomised and you must discover which combinations of glyphs will allow you to fight trolls, imps, demons, fires and floods and which ones will cause you to accidentally summon trolls, imps, demons, fires and floods. You may not always have the right tools for the job, but when all you have is the capacity to tear open a rift to the water dimension every problem looks like a fire...\nEvery copy of the game comes with plastic miniatures for the imps, trolls, demons, golems and the playable wizards. Resin miniatures are available in some pledge levels or as add-ons. These require some assembly, but really capture the details of the characters that populate the academy. A resin version of any mini is a \u00a34 add on (you'll still receive the plastic mini so that you can start playing immediately).\nThe characters have all been brought to life by the drawings of Sean Andrew Murray and realised as miniatures by Justin Bintz. While their previous work speaks for itself we're particularly impressed with the job they've done with the characters and villains of Wizard's Academy.\nThe disaster and location cards are standard poker size (63x88mm) and fit standard card sleeves. The spell cards are 46x69mm and should comfortably fit 47x70mm swan sleeves. The box contains room to store all of the cards sleeved.\nIf you'd like to know more about the gameplay we're presently all working together to update the wording of the rules on google docs. Feel free to jump in with your comments on the Core Rules or Grimoire.\nYou could also check out the January Print and Play or the pre-edit rules pdf or you can take a look at the videos below.\nThe first video gives a run through of the game's rules, for people who want to know how to play. The other consists of a minute of footage taken from the hundreds of hours of playtesting we've done with the game, to give you a quick idea of what it feels like to play the game.\nReviews\nBlue Peg Pink Peg: \"It's not like anything I've ever played and I mean that in a really good way.\" (Review is 16:10-21:30 when opened in firefox and 26:38-31:58 when opened in chrome)\nBox of Delights: \"This is the game that I'm most excited about for 2015\"\nCardboard Vault: \"I also really liked how the scenarios aren't really linear, there are a lot of different ways to approach the same problem.\"\nThe Dice Tower: \"The scenarios ... the layout of your academy ... the way that cards come up ... the spell organisation and the spell grid ...

The only solution is to pin the rooms together and freeze them in place in waves of ice before the academy pulls itself apart forever.\nAlso, it's not strictly a result of the Enhancement spell, but there's also a backer designer scenario added freely to all copies of the game as part of the hard work that backers have done during this campaign to help make it a success :)\nUnlocked: Arcarna\nThe Arcarna spell has been cast, adding three new spell cards to the game.

The ways that the different heroes can join up with different races gives the game great replayability.  Dice rolling, area control, special cards with bonus powers, and more than a few surprises means that Battleborn Legacy is a game that you will want to play!\" - Cody Carlson, TDG Reviews\n\n\"What I like about Battleborn Legacy is that it provides that \"epic game\" taste without a lot of complicated rules or a long grind.  The game takes off quickly and builds into an exciting back-and-forth struggle between players.  It plays out similar to a real time strategy game session.\" - Brian Cohen, Play Tester\n\n\"One of the great things about Battleborn Legacy is the balanced playing field. Despite the different heroes and races the balance feels great! Even in games where one player takes a seemingly early lead, the other players can easily get themselves back into the game.\" - Jack Herman, Play Tester\n\n\"My first turn saw armies pitted against each other and knights slain as my Orc horde fought to defend their homeland.  Sir Gruntsnort held the line as my powerful necromancer, Solenger struck out against my foes. An awesome experience at Gencon 2014!

Players take turns drawing cards until someone draws an exploding kitten and loses the game. The deck is made up of cards that let you avoid exploding by peeking at cards before you draw, forcing your opponent to draw multiple cards, or shuffling the deck.\n\nThe game gets more and more intense with each card you draw because fewer cards left in the deck means a greater chance of drawing the kitten and exploding in a fiery ball of feline hyperbole.\nThe game was created by Elan Lee (Xbox, ARGs), Matthew Inman (The Oatmeal), and Shane Small (Xbox, Marvel).  We think this game combines all the things we're best at creating, and and put together this Kickstarter campaign because we can't build this without you.\nSo if you're into card games or laser beams or weaponized enchiladas, please help us make this game a reality.  We think you'll love it as much as we do.\nHugs and enchilada kisses, \n-Elan, Matt, and Shane.\nThe Origin Story\nExploding Kittens started when Shane Small proposed a game to Elan Lee where a joker was inserted into a deck of cards and they took turns picking cards until the joker came up. It was called \u201cBomb Squad\u201d and it wasn\u2019t any fun at all.\nOver the next few weeks, two important things happened: First, after neglecting work, family, and a social life, Shane and Elan developed a rule-set that started working and brought the game to life. Second, Matt Inman saw the game, thought it was super fun, and asked to join the team. (btw, if Matthew Inman ever asks you if he can join your team, the answer is \u201cHELL YES\u201d.)\nWe changed the name to \"Exploding Kittens\" and our little team was born.\nBUT YOU'RE BLOWING UP KITTENS! NOT COOL, BUDDY.\nWe struggled with this a lot. We love the name Exploding Kittens, but we don't want to hurt kittens. We also don't want the kittens to be hurt by anyone else. Eventually we decided to explore the concept of the kittens blowing themselves up.\nFirst, Matt tried drawing the kittens as the actual bombs:\nBut that felt too Angry Birds\u2019ish.\nNext, we tried making the kittens suicidal, but that felt terrible.\nIn the end, we realized that everyone understands feline shenanigans, and that could be our solution.  Our kitties would not blow up out of malicious intent or negligence, but by doing the things that kittens do, like running across keyboards or chewing on things they shouldn't be chewing on.\nFrom there, the rest of the cards fell into place, and the cards used to defuse the exploding kittens were items you'd use to defuse regular kittens.\nHELP US BUILD THIS GAME\nWe wanted to put this project on Kickstarter because it's the fastest way for us to get the game into your hands and make improvements as a community.  We think this game is great, but we need your help making it even better.\nSo, if a world full of weaponized pork missiles is a world you want to live in, please back this project and help us build this game. \n\nWith love and pork missiles,\n-The Exploding Kittens Team  (Matt, Elan, and Shane)\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nFor more information about the game: http://www.explodingkittens.com\n\nFollow us:  Facebook  Twitter\n\nMusic: Royalty-free music from Bensound.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nProduction of the game is simple: it's just a card game, so other than building the box it's a relatively straightforward product to make.

What resources will fill your limited cargo holds and which crew members will you take under your wing?\nOnce in flight, your responsibilities as captain will push your limits: Monitor the condition of your crew, civilians and modules, ensure a steady flow of resources and navigate celestial bodies all while evading a pursuing enemy.\nFew composers are more clearly associated with the space genre in gaming than Jack Wall and we were thrilled when he showed interest in the project.

Previously he served as the Lead Designer for Battlefield 4: Dragons Teeth and had Senior / Lead roles on the Medal of Honor and SOCOM franchises.

This board game provides a rich 4X experience without an overly complex rule-set and can be played within a couple of hours. All the depth of a classic 4X game in a fraction of the time can be yours when you back Planetary Reign!\nPlanetary Reign is a space civilization board game based on classic video games of the same genre from the 1980's and 90's. Each player is the leader of a space-faring empire that is attempting to expand into and exploit the riches of a new-found galaxy.\n As the leader of THULE, VEYNA, METHIOS or CALDERA, you will assign your workers to a variety of actions - choosing which, when and how often they will be performed - with the ultimate goal being to dominate the galaxy and ensure the survival of your people.\nAs the game progresses, your empire will evolve, upgrade and send its fleets into a galaxy to explore its unknown worlds. You will encounter planets with strange environments, hosts of alien species and a variety of resources - as well as occasionally running into your opponents. \nThe main mechanics employed in Planetary Reign are worker placement and area control, as well as a brand new species assimilation mechanic. After nearly 5 years in development, Planetary Reign has been designed for players who seek a medium to heavy game with a low luck factor. There are multiple scoring paths and rounds - the winner being the empire with the most points at the end of the game. \nThere are several variants included with the game and many more on their way.  Also available for download from the publishers website will be two variants which simplify the overall game - making it easier for family and non-gamer friends to enjoy leading a space empire.\nPlanetary Reign is played over a series of 9 or 12 Years. Each year consists of three phases and each phase is broken down into three steps. Phases 1 and 2 are simple and quick, upkeep phases. Phase 3 is where all of the action and scoring takes place and is the heart of the game.\nEach empire starts the game with a number of workers and resources at its disposal. During the action step, the leaders of each empire take turns in assigning their workers and resources to any of the eight action areas displayed on their Empire Panels.\nOnce the costs of an action have been met, an empire may then carry out that action. Empires continue performing actions until all of their workers have been exhausted or all have decided to pass.  Watch the phases overview video to find out more.\nLeaders have a variety of actions to choose from such as building, moving or hyperjumping fleets, dispatching probes, colonizing, populating and mining planets, advancing technology and culture levels, performing military tactics and installing structures.  Each leader must choose its actions wisely and place its trust in destiny.\nDuring the reset step, leaders simply return all assigned workers back to their reserves - ready to be re-assigned to actions in the following year.  Any alien species that were gathered from planets and assigned to actions may now be assimilated (converted to an empire's workers).  Each type of species found in the galaxy aids an empire in performing a particular action.\nPlayers continue in this manner until it is time for a status step (scoring round) which takes place at designated intervals in the game. During these steps, your empire will be tallied and compared with that of your opponents and points will be awarded for Domination, Tributes, Armadas and Structures.\nThe empire with the highest status reigns over the galaxy and wins!\nPlanetary Reign is a pure euro-game and comes with both a streamlined set of rules and a wide array of cardboard and wooden components.  Everything needed for four players along with the first structure expansion (which allows the advanced game to be played) is included in this boxed edition. Watch the components overview video below to find out more. (Photographic images are of hand made prototypes). \nIn the box you will find:\n1 x Rules Booklet, 1 x Galaxy Board, 1 x Year Track, 12 x Year Markers, 4 x Empire Panels, 2 x Map Cards, 1 x Initiative Marker, 4 x Gateway Tiles, 48 x Planet Tiles, 32 x Structure Modules, 32 x Structure Tiles, 36 x Fleet Discs (9 of each color), 200 x Worker Cubes (50 of each color), 120 x Resource Cubes (40 of each color), 60 x Species Cubes, 12 x Discovery Markers, 8 x Status Markers, 16 x Sector Bonus Markers, 12 x Salvage Fleet Markers, 4 x Disabled Fleet Markers, 2 x Scoring Sequence Tiles and 96 x Fleet Labels\n All cardboard components (including empire panels, galaxy maps and the year track) will be punched from 2mm thick cardboard. The main board will also be mounted on 2mm thick cardboard.  All 8mm cubes and 25mm discs will be wood and painted various colors.\nThe rear of each empire panel provides background information about an empire's home-world and race, adding flavor to the universe that you all seek to conquer. There are also several expansions planned - new galaxy maps, advanced structures, diplomacy modules, empire trait tiles, battle dice and even plastic miniatures. These future expansions will add variety to the game as well as create a path for each empire to further distinguish itself from its rivals. Below is an image showing the artwork for both sides of the 7 punch-boards as well as an image of the box base and lid.\nPledge your allegiance to Planetary Reign! We plan to keep the campaign simple, offering only two levels; one will help you follow the progress of the campaign, the other will see a beautifully crafted copy of the game sent to you following production. We hope that you can see what we've done with the prototype version of Planetary Reign, as well as what we dream of achieving with the final production copies!\nWe're working alongside the US-based Game Salute to help us make Planetary Reign a reality, and we hope that the final product will be of the utmost quality. However, if you're unhappy with the end result, you will be entitled to invoke the Game Salute Guarantee.\nGame Salute Guaranteed is our promise that Planetary Reign will be produced with quality components and that you will enjoy the time you spend with the game. If you're not satisfied with Planetary Reign, simply return it to our headquarters within 30 days of receiving it, and we'll refund your pledge. That's our no-questions-asked money-back guarantee. \nShipping is expensive. We've calculated the cost to ship this game to backers around the world and we're subsidizing that to help keep your costs down. The cost to ship this game to backers in the USA is approximately $15, meaning that Game Salute will cover that part of the shipping cost for ALL backers around the world. That means that the pledge level for US backers includes shipping. For international backers, we're passing along the same savings on shipping. Simply check the chart below, find your destination group, then follow the line to see your total pledge amount. \nTo keep the shipping costs as low as possible, we ship packages via a variety of shipping services depending on your specific location. We use USPS, FedEx, UPS, and DHL. You will be responsible for any import fees, brokerage or delivery surcharges, or applicable taxes that may be levied after we have shipped your package. \nLet us know when you pledge at a retailer level and we'll list your store here to encourage local backers to choose in-store delivery through Game Salute Local Support, earning you the full margin on those games, too, just as if you had sold them yourself. \nWe are pleased to offer access to our game designers and creative team for podcast, blog, newspaper, or television interviews. Team members can also be present for conventions and event appearances with a timely invitation and appropriate travel and lodging expense allowances. Please contact us via Kickstarter to discuss such opportunities! \nIf you have any questions while our campaign is running or following the conclusion of the campaign, feel free to post on the main comments thread or email Kickstarter@GameSalute.com. Our service team strives to reply promptly to all questions and comments (except for when we're sleeping or eating or other basic bodily functions, and sometimes even then!) \nWhen we announce that reward packages are shipping, you can direct your inquiries to Service@GameSalute.com or call 1-888-57-GAMES (examples: when packages have shipped, updating your address, reconciling payment).

From which they will develop their empire by managing resources, expanding their fleet, colonizing planets, and exploiting their enemies' position. \nThe game runs on a clever dice combo-ing mechanic; players roll for their actions and choose the order in which to take them. This can lead to big \"pay-off\" turns, especially when combo-ed with planet abilities!\nThroughout the game, players spend resources to upgrade their empires, re-roll unwanted dice, and even follow the actions of other players' dice!\nPlayers will accumulate power (victory points) based on the level of their empire, as well as for successfully colonizing planets. When a player has reached a power of 21 or higher, the end of the game is triggered.\nWorried that rolling dice may lead to too much luck!? Don't worry, we've got you covered. Here are 5 mechanics we have in place to mitigate the luck element: \nFree reroll of as many unlocked dice as you'd like, once per turn.\nEnergy (spend 1 to reroll as many unlocked dice as you'd like, as many times as you can pay for).\nCulture (spend 1 to use to take an action off-turn of another player's locked in dice rolls, so you don't have to bank on your own luck alone).\nConverter (as described above)\nPlanet Abilities (provides all sorts of good things, like resources, planet influence, empire upgrades etc. all the things that you would want from your dice).\nThe dice in Tiny Epic Galaxies bring excitement to the game, not lack of meaningful decisions. \nYour Very Own Galaxy Card! \nBlue Player has 3 Energy, 6 Culture, and a level 4 Empire; granting access to 3 Rocket Ships and 6 Dice. Blue Player has a total of 8 Victory Points, 5 from colonized planets and 3 from his/her Empire Level.\nThe Control Card and the Dice\nA level 1 Empire starts with 4 dice. You get 1 free re-roll (as many dice as you'd like) every turn. Still don't like your roll? Spend Energy; 1 Energy for each additional re-roll.\nPlanet Cards - Acquiring & Conquering\nAcquiring Resources is based on what kind of Planet Cards your Ships are on.

Here are some fun social media avatars you can use to help with that:\nAll rewards for this project will be shipped from the US.\nDelivering Your Reward\nMy number one goal, and responsibility, is to deliver the rewards that you pledge for. I'm proud to say that I have achieved this with every project that I have run, but not without learning from mistakes. \nI was burned on unexpected increases to shipping costs with Tiny Epic Defenders, and quickly learned that I have to be more responsible in accounting for that risk.\nTo do this, I must adjust my shipping discounts. Shipping is a volatile cost that I cannot undermine. I simply cannot commit to shipping methods or discounts that would price me out of fulfilling my responsibility and promise to you. Thank you for your patience and understanding.\nShipping Costs\nEvery backer is important to me, regardless of location, there are just certain realities in shipping costs that we all have to face. To offset this, while remaining fiscally responsible, I have included a small discount for ALL shipping, but US shipping is not free. Shipping discounts, as well as game discounts, get even deeper at higher quantity packs, making 6 and 10 packs great group pledges!\nRegarding customs; because this game comes in a tiny box with a low declaration, most international backers, of 1 or 2 copies, should not get hit with customs or import fees. We shipped thousands of copies of Tiny Epic Kingdoms to international backers and I've only heard of a couple of incidents where a backer (of 1 or 2 copies) was hit with any sort of fees.\nAlso please keep this in mind; the base game will retail with a $25 MSRP. So international backers who get the base game ($16 for the game + $12 for international shipping) are only paying $3 more than a future gamer who picks the game up off the shelf in the US! AND, if you are getting the deluxe version, you're getting an even better deal! The total cost (not including effort) to acquire and \"assemble\" a deluxe copy after the Kickstarter will be at least $35 BEFORE shipping. I say assemble because you will not be able to buy it all in one place, you'll have to pay for shipping twice. This is assuming that the BGG store picks up the deluxe content, which they have not committed to at this time. \n\"Tiny Epic\" is a series of games designed by Scott Almes and published by Gamelyn Games. Each game in this series must strictly adhere to TWO core values: Tiny and Epic! Tiny meaning small (pocket-sized) box with simple and easy to understand rules. Epic meaning gratifying gameplay with lots of strategy and replay-ability. Over the course of numerous games, the series will explore many unique genres and themes.\nCurrently the line features a 4X/Civ game called Tiny Epic Kingdoms and a cooperative Tower Defense game called Tiny Epic Defenders.\nTiny Epic Galaxies, a dice driven/engine building game is the third installment in the smash-hit-series!\nThe \"Tiny Epic\" series began at exactly this time LAST year with its flagship game Tiny Epic Kingdoms! Which has since been fulfilled and backers are LOVING IT!! \nClick to visit the Tiny Epic Kingdoms' Kickstarter page\nThe second game in the series is a thematic sequel to Tiny Epic Kingdoms called Tiny Epic Defenders.\nClick to visit the Tiny Epic Defenders' Kickstarter page\nAfter Tiny Epic Galaxies, gamers can expect to see more Tiny Epic games in the near future! Stay tuned by joining the Gamelyn Games newsletter (right side column) here: http://www.gamelyngames.com/cms/\nAll Add-Ons for this project are included in the reward tiers and/or will be handled AFTER the project within PledgeManager. There are no separate Add-Ons during the project.\nIf you'd like to add additional copies of Tiny Epic Galaxies to your pledge beyond what is available in the reward tiers, you may do so within PledgeManager.\nTiny Epic Kingdoms and Tiny Epic Defenders WILL be available to add onto your pledge within PledgeManager. There will be deluxe copies available in limited quantity and on a first come, first serve basis. \nWhy YOU should back Tiny Epic Galaxies on Kickstarter:\nBesides it being an epic good time, without Kickstarter, and more importantly YOU, the game would not be produced.

It is prone to many mistakes and that does not exclude experienced publishers.\n\nWe're proud to say that we are prepared for the task at hand and have years of experience in successfully fulfilling board game projects.\n\nHere are the steps we are taking to prepare and reduce the likelihood of mistakes and delays:\n\n1. We have done significant pre-production. This includes having all the art for the game completed and the graphic art over 75% completed. The production quote is in hand and ready to be initiated.\n\n2. We are proud to be working with Panda Game Manufacturing again, the same manufacturer I have used to create of Rise!, The Lost Dutchman, Dungeon Heroes, Fantasy Frontier, the Fantasy Gaming Figures,the GIANT Meeples, Tiny Epic Kingdoms and Tiny Epic Defenders. We have a great relationship with their entire team. We are familiar with their production requirements, timelines, payment schedules, communication methods and Chinese freight arrangements. Together we have created some great games and products and we hope that Tiny Epic Galaxies will be our next!\n\n3. Professional distribution is already in place, and we are proud to say it will be handled by Ship Naked. They were responsible for having fulfilled the shipments of Rise!, Dungeon Heroes, Fantasy Frontier and Tiny Epic Kingdoms. All were delivered on schedule with professionalism and reliability.

As a player, you become a crew member of the spaceship Liberty. Together, you and your fellow crew mates will complete a series of objectives to win the game. Sounds easy, right? Well, there\u2019s a bit more to the game. Every turn, you lose a resource from the Resource Bar on the board. If this ever reaches the bottom, you will lose the game. The way to replenish resources is to deliver cargo. You\u2019ll be burning resources as you travel around the board to make this happen. Still, not so hard. But\u2026quite often the evil UO Scout ship will appear to chase you across the system in an attempt to interrogate one of your crew members and temporarily remove them from the game. Each time they show up, a UO Eye Marker is added to the planet the Liberty is located on and these are tracked by a UO Presence bar on the board. If this ever reaches the top, you lose the game. Now things are getting interesting. Just when you think you have everything under control, you draw an Event card that prevents you from being able to move Liberty or one that doubles the UO Scout ship\u2019s movement on the board. So if you can manage all that and a few other surprises while completing those objectives, you win Space Movers! See video below for a demo of Space Movers in action. \nWhat Makes Space Movers Unique\nSkill Checks - Many of the cards that are played in the game require Skill Checks to be completed as an Action on your turn. Skill Checks are nothing new, but is the WAY they are completed in Space Movers that makes it unique. Let\u2019s say 3 dice are needed for a particular Skill Check: black, red and any other-we\u2019ll choose blue. We will roll onto the special roll board in the bottom of the game box. And we won\u2019t throw the dice in all at one time. We roll them one at a time and because each player controls a die, multiple players will likely participate in the check. So the player controlling black rolls his 10-sided die, looking for a 5 or higher for success. It lands on 5 \u2013 great! The player controlling red then rolls her die and it only lands on 1, which is a fail. But not to worry! The player controlling the blue die will aim his die at the red one, attempting to hit it and change the result. He changed the red die to a 2, which is still a fail and his blue die lands on 5. So it seems we failed the check. But\u2026the current player gets one final attempt with a blank 6-sided die to change the result of that failed red one. He hits the red die and it lands on a 5. All 3 dice are successes so the Skill Check is passed. Check out the skill check example video below.\nComic Book - While developing the Characters for Space Movers, we created a back story for them that could be included in the rulebook. The more we thought about it, the more it seemed like they needed more than just a paragraph in the rulebook. So we thought of the comic format and our awesome illustrator Jon agreed to help with it. It was a lot of extra work for Jon and for us, but we are really happy with the finished product. \nLINK: FULL COMIC PREVIEW!\nEver-Changing Story \nEvery game of Space Movers tells a different story and there are two ways to tell that story. The first is with different sets of 5 Objective cards that continue the adventure that began in the comic. The base game will come with one of these sets.\nFor those who need more variety, we have added a 20-card Random Objective card deck to the base game. If you don\u2019t want to follow the story line, you can complete 5  randomly chosen objectives from this deck. (Or more if you\u2019re feeling lucky!)  If we\u2019re comparing these to your favorite TV show, the Objective card sets (5) would be the continuing story arc and the Random Objectives would be the standalone episodes that are woven through the series.\nIt\u2019s not just the Objective cards that determine the story told during a game. Each time you play, you will be forced into new scenarios based on the way cards are drawn from the deck and on the choices you make as a team. Because of this, no two games of Space Movers is ever alike.\nWe are also including a Kickstarter Edition exclusive Objective Card set in this printing, as well as a stretch goal for a new Objective card set that will further the original story.  Future expansions for Space Movers will introduce even more Objective cards (sets and random), new characters (maybe not all of them will be good guys?), new comic books and new game boards with other locations for our crew to explore. New roll boards will offer exciting new challenges for Skill Checks. We have tons of ideas. We just have to get the base game made first!\nSoundtrack - Because Space Movers is above all else about story, we\u2019re including a soundtrack for the game. Think of it as musical wallpaper, it\u2019s just there in the background to add to the experience. It is available on our website to stream for free as you play the game.\nWhat Others Say About Space Movers!\n\"In the realm of galactic tabletop gaming, this is surely one of the most interesting and immersive new releases in some time.\"  - Tony Nunes, Starlog\nLINK: FULL STARLOG MAGAZINE REVIEW\n\u201cWhen I play a co-op game I want to NOT care one bit whether I won or lost, I want to look back and say that was fun regardless of the outcome, and that\u2019s what Space Movers does for me.

This allows you to provide something to your customers they will not be able to get ANYWHERE ELSE EVER AGAIN, and they can only get it if they go through a store. Plus, you will be receiving the copies of the comic well in advance of the game (these should be delivered to you within 2 months of funding). Our hope is that this will allow you to get pre-orders for the game and minimize or even eliminate your investment.  \nNote:One copy of the comic will be shipped to your store for each game copy (1 Retailer Pack of 5 copies of Space Movers = 5 Exclusive Kickstarter Editions of Finding Liberty). This is in addition to the copy of Finding Liberty that will be included with the game.  \nThe Retailer Pack reward level includes shipping to any store within the US. If you are a Retailer outside the US, please contact us for shipping charges before pledging.\n Kevin and April Cox \u2013 Owners/Game Designers\nKnA Games is not a major, established game company. It is comprised of two people - Kevin and April Cox. We live in NC and our passions include movies, Disney and gaming.\nWe love board games and have an extensive collection (over 100 games) to prove it. Our collection includes everything from vintage finds like Dogfight and Voice of the Mummy to new classics like Ticket to Ride and Pandemic. Some of our current favorites are Battlestar Gallactica (Kevin\u2019s) and Letters from Whitechapel (April\u2019s). It was our love of the gaming hobby that led us to our newest hobby, game design.\nAlthough we have published a few games for very specific markets (disc golf and mini golf), Space Movers will be our first tabletop board game. And hopefully it will help us to transition our love of creating unique games into a career. We hope you will see our energy and passion in this project and give us a chance to deliver Space Movers to YOUR game table. We believe you will love it as much as we do. Trust us when we say we have big plans for the future. This edition of Space Movers is just the beginning. We hope you will go on the adventure with us!  \nJon Hrubesch - Illustrator\nI am the artist who is helping to design the look of the Space Movers board game with the direction of Kevin and April Cox of KnA Games.  I am married to Julie and have three children, Allen, Nick and Liana.  I live in Wisconsin and work for a local NBC affiliate T.V. news station as a graphic artist, director and production assistant which I have been doing for the last 25 years.  In my free time I create artwork depicting images of science fiction and fantasy. \n I have created artwork for Fantasy Flight Games and have been featured in, the 100th anniversary issue of ImagineFX, Ballistic Publishing\u2019s Expose 11 and Dopress Books Digital Art Techniques & Process.\nThe characters of the Space Movers board game are from an image I created of a starship crew that I posted on DeviantART.  That image caught the eye of Kevin Cox from KnA Games as being a perfect fit for the 80\u2019s style science fiction board game he had been working on.  This Kickstarter is the result of the collaboration that began after Kevin sent me an email asking me if I would be interested in having my starship crew characters be the stars of his game.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe will do everything within our power to deliver Space Movers on time.

Players explore the ruins of the modern world completing quests, honing their skills and maneuvering for social status in order to claim a precious spot as a citizen with a Golden City. To enter the Golden city you must:\nBecome an expert: Reach 20 skill points\nServe the city: Fulfill three secret quests\nBecome a nobleman: Get the most possible character points\nIn each turn, the players can spend action points to do several actions such as moving through the city, raiding buildings, attacking other players, and more. Each player has a specific skill \u2014 mechanic, trader, electrician, bodyguard and medic \u2014 and has his own unique items to build; those items can be traded off against other items or resources.\nThe board of the game is formed by 9 different tiles. All over the map, the players find different buildings which they can raid. Each time a player raids a building, a raid card of this type of building is taken and read, which leads to specific circumstances taking place. The player will be made to make various decisions including important moral decisions! Upon resolving the various decisions, you will receive character points. The choices you make, for good or for bad, will lead to specific perks and advantages (or disadvantages) during the progress of the game. \nOur goal is to print the game and make it available in Europe, USA Canada and every other possible location. In order to achieve that, we need your support to reach our funding goal of $15.000 which will help us cover a part of the print costs (miniatures production, molds, game printing, taxes, shipping).\nThis should be good enough to get an idea of the game. This is not the final rulebook and it will be professionally edited and re-written before it is released. You can see now how it will look like, the set-up etc.\nDOWNLOAD\nWe still develop some components like, final images for the items and the raid cards as well as the final text. \n1 Resource Pouch\nDice Tower:\nUndead Viking Review:\n JPlay previews Raid & Trade:\nZcat Zombie Show:\nFATHER GEEK\nGIOCONOMICON: Anteprime: Raid & Trade \u2013 La via delle wasteland radioattive\nBOARD GAMING: The strong theme and intensity of competition comes through thanks to the great art and the constant motion of the game. Although multiple paths to victory is not a new concept, it gives this game a refreshing departure from a victory point track and rescues it from being two dimensional. Random game board/tile setup keeps the game different each time you play and the player boards with the dials (a la King of Tokyo) is a nice touch that\u2019s just cool. If the theme and intensity of a post-apocalyptic setting with some fresh mechanics appeals to you, Raid and Trade will deliver.\nBOARD GAME QUEST : Raid and Trade ended up being a fairly unique game that boasts a lot of player interaction. Between the resources, the trading and the crafting, I almost felt like I was playing in a post-apocalyptic version of The Settlers of Catan where not everyone is nice anymore.\nTHEOLOGY OF GAMES:  Jeremiah--We've given you a taste of the game play here, but as with any sandbox game the replay value is very high, and the strategic possibilities are also very high. At first this was a little tough to wrap our minds around, because it was still very much a work in progress. But with the multiple rules revisions we've been receiving, MAGE Company has shown they won't be satisfied until the game plays well. Firestone--I like the style, the theme, and the fact that there are multiple ways to win. And I commend them for trying to create a game that mashes up Euro mechanics with Ameritrash confrontation.\nGEEK DAD: The game is definitely intriguing enough that I want to try it again, especially trying out different characters, and see how different strategies will play out. I think it\u2019s also a game that will change depending on your opponents: if you\u2019ve got a bunch of conflict-shy players, you\u2019ll do more raiding and trading and less attacking; with more aggressive players, expect a lot of attacks and \u201ctake that\u201d incident cards.\nCUBO\nTHE HOUSES\nGLOBAL EVENTS\nINCIDENTS\nMAP TILES \nDepending on where in the world you are, we will either ship you from our hub in Germany (EU backers),  or New Hampshire (USA and the rest of the world). As a rough estimate, the game will cost about $0 to ship in the USA as we always offer free shipping in USA, $10 in EU, $15-$35 in Canada depending on the pledge level, $30-60 to the rest of the world depending on the pledge level and the country,  but this may increase or decrease based on the quantity of stretch goals we might unlock and the pledge level you choose. These prices are already discounted since we pay more. For example. We charge $10 for 1 copy of R&T in Europe but we pay $15 - $26 depending the country.\nDo note that while we do our best to get you your rewards on time, you may not necessarily receive your rewards before the product makes it into distribution in your own country. We hope that the discounted price and exclusive items you will get during the Kickstarter will make up for any such possible lag. However, if this is something that is not acceptable to you, please do not back this project but instead wait for the retail release. \nMEDIC PLEDGE LEVEL: Ship fees vary depending on which and how many Add On items you will choose. In order to be fair with everyone we will charge and collect those fees after the end of this campaign or you can contact us first here, we will let you know the amount and you can pledge accordingly.\nALL THE OTHER PLEDGE LEVELS: Under shipping details for each pledge level, Kickstarter offers the choice to us to add the costs for any country we can ship but is not visible any more.

We will be back!\nWith Event Horizon I wanted to create and capture the richness and depth of an expansive universe like Star Wars or Star Trek. I wanted bring the aspects of board gaming, and strategic miniatures together. I also wanted it to be fun as well as intuitive, to help bridge the gap between wargames and board games by providing a good intro for someone wanting to get into miniatures gaming. That not only involved doing a lot of research on cultures to develop the storyline and history, but also trying to realistically come up with an evolution of how the human race would change 3000 years from now. Then marry that story with a miniatures game that captured those feelings.\nEvent Horizon: Fleet Battles is a skirmish miniatures space combat wargame set in the year 5318. If you would like to support Event Horizon and can't back here on Kickstarter, you can back us on http://www.garage-gaming.com via PayPal. You'll receive the same rewards as Kickstarter backers, including Stretch Goals.\nEvent Horizon is an expansive sci-fi universe set in the future. It has been over 3000 years since Terra and the Sol system completely vanished without a trace, leaving humanity stranded in the Mobius system without a home. Before it disappeared, Terra wasn't much to look at due to years of pollution, caused by the decimation the Psionic Emergence left behind. Most of the privileged had already started to colonize Mars or expand to the Mobius system, but it didn't change the fact that Terra would always be 'home'. \nNo longer bound by one planet, humanity spread out amongst the stars to create multiple empires. Without having a home planet, the history of Terra slowly faded away, and it wasn't until long before the one common bond everyone shared started to vanish. Despite having access to the vast expanse of space and knowing the devastation of war, humanity had not learned its lesson. It just meant more planets to conquer or destroy. it would only be a matter of time before empires would start to clash with one another.\n\nHumanity had been easy to define because everyone was still 'human'. Even the psionics who emerged were human. But as some replaced their organs with cybernetics, or gene-spliced themselves with traits of another life-form, the definition of what it meant to be human began to blur. Under the name of survival, expansion, and even evolution, humanity went through changes depending on which empire they belonged too. Soon there were thousands of new colonies, all with their own ideals and beliefs. Some of the empires could no longer even be recognized as human, at least by visual appearances.\n\nThe galaxy is on the brink of an intergalactic war as you take command of a fleet of ships to defend your empire. Some will be fighting for personal belief and identity, while others just want to fight for sheer dominance of resources and control. What is it that you will fight for?\nWHAT IS EVENT HORIZON: FLEET BATTLES?\nEvent Horizon: Fleet Battles puts you in control of a fleet of starships comprised of high quality miniatures. It is designed to play on a 4'x6' - 6'x6' gaming area. The starships range from small destroyers to huge super-dreadnoughts packed with a vast arsenal of lasers, missiles, railguns, and squadrons of fighters. The standard game box includes everything you need to start a two player game.\n\nWe grew up watching cartoons and anime that depicted large scale spaceship battles. Some of our childhood favorites included Robotech, Star Blazers, Legend of the Galactic Heroes, Galaxy Express 999 and Captain Harlock. Even though there are already a few spaceship games out there, none of them seemed to capture that feeling of watching a couple ships maneuver against a fleet. Although we do love playing them, we didn't want to control a small group of starfighters or ships that didn't give us the feeling that we were in space. We wanted the spaceship battles to be a bit more realistic, but without over complicating things. Ships move and generate momentum, and simply turning the direction of the ship doesn't mean the ship changes the direction it is traveling. The momentum will continue to carry a ship in the direction it was going unless new thrust is applied to change that direction. We also wanted ship sensors to play an important part, and not have the game simply be one player reacting to how another player moves.\n\nSince most of at Garage Gaming originally came from a TCG and board game background, it only seemed natural that we would develop a movement system utilizing cards. This let us create a movement system where each player could plan their moves quickly and intuitively. Each ship has their own set of movement cards. Players will need to set up their own movement while trying to predict how their opponent will be moving. Once completed, the cards would be placed on the ship status cards face down. When we move to the movement phase, movement happens all at once, so you don't have to sit and wait for a player to move their ships before you move yours.\n\nYou can simply fight head to head against other players or use our scenario encounters to add more complexity to the game. With scenarios, players would design their fleets then roll on the encounter table. This will help setup the atmosphere and background for which they are fighting. They might be an assassination where the objective is to take out a specific enemy ship or they could be fighting in a nebula that hinders laser weapons. But you won't know the specifics until after you've designed your fleet, so choose wisely.\n\nThere are different ship miniatures that represent the six strongest factions in the galaxy. Each miniature can be purchased individually. Each faction also has a Fleet Starter Pack that can be purchased that contains four of the ship miniatures. The base game contains everything two players would need to start playing.\n\nYou are commanding a group of some of the most advanced starships in the galaxy while serving in the military of one of the powerful six factions in the galaxy. Take control of destroyers, cruisers, battleships, dreadnoughts and fighters. You will be playing against another player in tactical and strategic furious ship-to-ship combat. Win by eliminating all your opponents ships or complete objectives in one of the predetermined missions. \nEvent Horizon: Fleet Battles set includes all the core components necessary for two players to get started as well as several missions offering different victory conditions.\n\nGame Setup\nThe game is playable on a table surface of 4\u2019 x 4\u2019, although we do recommend playing on a 4' x 6' or 6\u2019 x 6\u2019 gaming area. The players will determine the amount of Fleet Points to allocate for the encounter, usually this is 1000-2000 points depending on the length of play you want. A typical 1000-2000 point game will last 1-2 hours. You then choose the faction you will be playing and create your fleet based on the ship choices for that faction.\nYou will be placing hex shaped tokens that represent your ships' signatures, instead of placing the actual ship miniatures, within 4\u201d of the play area border they are entering from. Unless you are playing a scenario that alters the setup, then you would follow the guidelines as outlined by the scenario instead. In order to reveal the real ship, players can move within passive sensor range (which is 36\u201d) to identify the ship. They can also engage active sensors to attempt to identify the ship, but by activating active sensors they reveal their own ship as well.\n \nGame Phases\nThe game is played in a series of game turns, each turn consists of four phases; Planning, Movement, Firing and Resolution Phase. A player can do multiple actions within those phases, the type of actions they can take depend on the phase. All players will get a chance to plan, move and fire for all ships. Once all the players have completed all the phases the next turn will start.\n\nMovement Example\nYou create ship movement orders utilizing the movement deck for each ship. Each movement deck contains 24 cards that outline the various orders that can be issued to a ship. Your ships movement orders can contain one of each card up to the amount equal to the ships main engine rating. The other player will not know how you plan to move your ship or what movement orders you will assign to it until it comes time to actually move the ships.\n\nExample: Player A controls a ship with 6 thrust. Player A can issue orders by selecting 6 cards or less. You would do this for each of the ships under your command, depending on the amount of thrust of each. Using the diagram below as an example, Player A decides to only issue 3 orders: Main Thrust, Turn Port 30\u00b0 (turn left), Main Thrust.\n\nWhen it is time to execute the ship movement during the Movement Phase, each ship before revealing their movement orders will first move the current momentum it has already built up. Currently, it is at a momentum of 2. So it will move 2\" in the direction of their momentum heading.\nWe will then use the movement cards, which you already queued up during the Planning Phase, to continue moving the ship. \nExample: Player A will now flip the movement cards over revealing the movement orders. Starting with Main Thrust which tells us to move that ship another 1\" forward. Then we reveal Turn Port 30\u00b0 which tells us to pivot that ship to the left by 30\u00b0. The last card is Main Thrust 1 which moved us another 1\" forward. You will notice we move forward towards the direction that the ship is facing.  \nTo finish the turn, we need to determine our ending momentum. We would then measure from the start momentum counter to where the new momentum counter goes.\nExample: In this case it is 3\". During the next turn in Phase 2, when it is time to move our ships again, this ship's momentum will move it 3\" towards the direction that the momentum counter counter is facing. That would happen before you reveal and apply the orders for the ship's next moves.\nFree shipping for the US, CA, UK & DE; See Calculating Postage for shipping costs to other locations.\nAs with all Pledge Levels, if you want to add any Add-ons increase your pledge by the appropriate amount.\nOur Thanks.

The base game has been created and gone through a gauntlet of testing. The modeling and writing is finished, they are just going through some final steps to add polish and details. Until we send everything to the printers we will still be testing and refining the rules. \n\nThe two biggest challenges as with most Kickstarters usually revolve around production and shipping. If production is delayed then as a fallout items tend to ship out late. When dealing with oversea contractors production can happen on time but due to customs or shipping to the US, this delays final shipping to customers. \n\nThis is our first Kickstarter campaign so we are new to this but we are not new to Kickstarter. We have also done our homework. We have had brilliant advice from people who have done multiple and successful campaigns. We have tried to anticipate any problems and have done our utmost to ensure that it all runs as smoothly as possible. We have already lined our up manufacturers and they are prepared to move forward once we give them the word. We could of probably done things cheaper if we focused on outsourcing to overseas but we kept most manufacturing locally. This means it is more work for us but we wanted more control and to be more involved in the process. We also wanted to limit delays in both production and shipping. By making almost every part of this game locally we have a greater control over issues and have the ability to make adjustments quicker where needed.\n\nWe want to ensure that we deliver a high quality product to our backers. Until final production we will always be tweaking and fine tuning the product so it may vary slightly from our prototypes in look and quantity. We are pushing the manufacturing process to its limits and there may be some components that need adjustment and certain quantities may need to be re-assessed if there are problems at the manufacturing stage.\n\nWe are as ready as we can be for this and we need your help to get us started. If we get stuck we will work through it to deliver you the best product possible, not a half baked compromise.

We have been painting the miniatures and should have some pictures to show next week. We are also still in the process of getting some of them cast in metal. \nNow I have another surprise as we continue to move forward.\nThe original idea was to utilize ship designs that didn't require a lot of cutting but could maintain the high quality detail and still be appealing. The designs were created with the ability to be cast as one piece or split into 1-3 smaller pieces. As we continue to look for new methods to keep this appealing to vast audiences, the goal is to make sure they still stay high quality miniatures. Although we can keep it high quality as 1-3 pieces, we eventually made the decision to change how we cut up and separated the miniatures. This actually lets us get a higher quality and detailed miniature while providing some interesting options for players."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #10", "update_userinfo": "Beta Box and Resin Casts", "update_content": "Time for another Friday update!\nGame Box\nWe are still progressing and working hard on making this game become a reality.

Be sure to subscribe to our newsletter at www.IndieBoardsAndCards.com to be informed of our next project.\nHave a question? Be sure to \"Contact Me\" to get an answer >>>>>\nCoup gets even bigger with a special edition expansion.\nIndie Boards and Cards is very excited to announce this exciting expansion for all the fans of our hugely successful Coup kickstarter last year. That project exceeded even our highest expectations and I am confident that almost every one of our backers got a great game that they enjoyed and played with their friends.  It was clear that many of those friends ended up buying a copy for themselves because we went through a bunch in a very short amount of time (and are still waiting for the reprint of the retail version to arrive).  That kind of response is amazing, Rikki and I couldn't be more excited than to have so many people enjoy this great game.  Making games that are fun to play and get enjoyed around the world is why we make them!\nReformation is exciting expansion to Coup, and to celebrate the successes of the game we are launching a special edition of the expansion via kickstarter.  Reformation KS Edition starts off where our last project finished - it is a special version of the expansion that won't go into distribution and it already has all of its stretch goals unlocked.  If you want to be the first to get this special edition and get it at a great price then you will want to pledge for this project.\nAnd if you missed getting Coup last year, or want to get both the Reformation Expansion and the Coup base game at the same time we are also offering a special combination package (Reformation & Coup KS edition) that has many of promo items that you might have missed.\nIn addition to developing great games, we have also been focused on improving our US & international shipping processes.  That means we can offer even lower shipping costs to almost everywhere in the world and we are offering a special \"add on\" rates for those that might have missed out on one of our earlier releases.\nSo thank you in advance for your support - we are super excited to be able to bring another great title to your gaming table.\nDriven by their successes, the resistance has gained popular support and entire regions are in open rebellion.In a desperate attempt to stay in control, some government leaders are publically supporting the reforms demanded by the resistance.But allegiances are constantly shifting, and can be bought for the right price.\nThe opportunity for intrigue and bluff has never been greater.The cost of failure couldn\u2019t be higher.Even with talk of reformation, only one can survive.\nReformation is an expansion to Coup, a copy of Coup is required to play.Reformation adds Allegiances \u2013 players are either in support of the government (Loyalists) or the resistance (Reformists). Reformation also includes the Inquisitor variant, and additional role cards to expand play up to 10 players.\nOriginally introduced in a very limited edition at Essen 2013 that sold out in hours, Reformation is a perfect expansion to an already great game adding a new layer of manipulation and deceit for Coup fanatics. If you\u2019d like more information about Reformation please read this review posted here.\nIn the not too distant future, the government is run for profit by a new \u201croyal class\u201d of multi-national CEOs.Their greed and absolute control of the economy has reduced all but a privileged few to lives of poverty and desperation.Out of the oppressed masses rose The Resistance, an underground organization focused on overthrowing these powerful rulers. The valiant efforts of The Resistance have created discord, intrigue and weakness in the political courts of the noveau royal, bringing the government to brink of collapse.But for you, a powerful government official, this is your opportunity to manipulate, bribe and bluff your way into absolute power.\nTo be successful, you must destroy the influence of your rivals and drive them into exile.In these turbulent times there is only room for one to survive.\nCoup is a lightning fast game of bluff and manipulation for 2-6 players.If you are not already familiar with Coup - here is a quick overview and review from Tom Vasel, an industry leading reviewer:\n If you don\u2019t already have Coup, you will need to get it in order to use the Reformation expansion.The Reformation & Coup KS pledge levels (starting at $30) is a great way to get both at the same time or to upgrade your retail copy to include all the nice little extras of the kickstarter edition (alternative art cards & foil coins).\nWant to combine the two reward levels and get one (or more) copies of the Reformation & Coup Kickstarter Editions with one (or more) of the Reformation Kickstarter Editions?  See update #6 for details by clicking here.\nWe made this very easy for everyone and reduced the chances of a project delay at the same time!Based on our past kickstarter projects we are going to include all the stretch goals as soon as the project funds \u2013 we have everything ready to go to the printers to reduce the time between your pledge and when you receive your rewards.That might sound like a cope out, but this isn\u2019t a project where you get the planned retail version of the game and a few extras \u2013 the rewards in this project are a very special edition of this expansion that won\u2019t be available through game distributors.This project is really intended for the Coup fanatics out there!\nSo as soon we reach our funding goal, every copy of rewards will include these stretch rewards that won\u2019t be part of the Reformation expansion retail edition:\nGold Foil Box \u2013 To keep costs as low as possible, the retail version of Reformation is packed in a blister card and everything fits in your original Coup box.That won\u2019t work if you have either of the kickstarter editions; it certainly won\u2019t work if you have both the Reformation kickstarter edition and the Coup kickstarter edition.We\u2019ve redesigned the Reformation box in a very attractive gold finish that is sure to grab everyone\u2019s attention that sees it.But it isn\u2019t just a pretty face \u2013 we\u2019ve made the box slightly wider and taller so that it fits all the cards and coins with just a little extra room.It is still a compact box so you can bring it everywhere that you might want to enjoy Coup.\nMore Alternative Art Cards \u2013 The alternative art cards from kickstarter last year have been a huge success, so we are doubling down here and introducing two more sets of alternative art cards for all 6 characters \u2013 two new dukes, two new contessas, two new captains, two new assassins, two new ambassadors and two new inquisitors.These alternative art cards aren't just pretty to look at, they serve a functional purpose as they make slight modification to how the game is played with the potential to introduce more logic into the game.When combine with Coup kickstarter edition (or via the Reformation & Coup KS pledge levels) you will have enough alternative art cards to play up to 10 with unique art on every card.\nGold Foil Coins \u2013 Reformation doesn\u2019t really need any more coins to play than what comes in the Coup box, and the retail version won\u2019t have any additional coins.But these new gold foil coins really do shine, and they are so much fun to play with.Just don\u2019t let the other players target you because you have one!\nAnd if you back at the Reformation & Coup KS levels ($30 and above) you\u2019ll also get these stretch goals from our past Coup kickstarter rewards:\nAlternative Art Cards \u2013 The original set of alternative art cards for all 6 characters two different dukes, two different contessas, two different captains, two different assassins, two different ambassadors and two different inquisitors.In total it is enough to play up to 10 players with different art on every card \u2013 quite a fun experience especially combined with the Allegiance mechanics in Reformation!\nSilver Foil Coins \u2013 The shiny coins were a big hit and we are bringing them back for those that missed them the first time.These are something that the printer wasn\u2019t sure they could do, but they turned out great and add just enough to the game to really make it stand out on your table.\nFor a complete diagram of what comes in each version of Reformation - please see UPDATE #2 by clicking here\nAs a special reward for kickstarter backers and as a result of the advances we\u2019ve made in reducing shipping costs, we are able to offer great prices when adding some of our older titles when you pledge for Coup Reformation.Prices for each of these add-ons are shown as $X / $Y / $Z.US and Canadian Shipping address add $X for that item, EU addresses add $Y and every else in the world adds $Z to their pledge to get that add on.All add on items will be shipped at the same time as your Coup Reformation rewards and to the same address.These special prices are for the retail versions only and do not include promotional items from past kickstarter projects.\n The Resistance: $14/$19/$21 \u2013 watch it played on TableTop: \nThe Resistance: Avalon: $14/$19/$21 \u2013 Watch it played on Shut Up & Sit Down:\nFlash Point: Fire Rescue: $28/$35/$42\nUrban Structures or 2nd Story or Dangerous Waters (Flash Point Expansions): $10/$14/$15\nExtreme Danger (Flash Point Expansion):$28/$35/$42\nVeteran & Rescue Dog (Flash Point Expansion):$8/$10/$10\nWatch Drakkenstrike's video review:\nSnowdonia:$50/$60/$65 \nJungfraubahn & Mt. Washington (Snowdonia Expansion): $10/$14/$15\nWatch Rahdo\u2019s Video review:\nExamples of \u201chow to\u201d for add-ons:\nIf you back Coup Reformation for $15 (US Shipping) and wanted to add The Resistance & The Resistance: Avalon - you would select the $15 reward level and pledge $43 ($15 + $14 + $14).\nIf you back Coup Reformation for $20 (Canadian Shipping) and wanted to add Flash Point Fire Rescue and Urban Structures - you would select the $20 reward level and pledge $58 ($20 + $28 + $10).\nIf you back Coup Reformation for $23 (International Shipping, EU Address) and wanted to add Snowdonia and Jungfraubahn & Mt. Washington - you would select the $23 reward level and pledge $97 ($23 + $60 + $14).\nIf you back Coup Reformation for $23 (International Shipping, non-EU Address) and wanted to add Snowdonia and Jungfraubahn & Mt. Washington - you would select the $23 reward level and pledge $103 ($23 + $65 + $15).\nIf you back Coup Reformation for $29 (Brazil Shipping) and wanted to add Snowdonia and Jungfraubahn & Mt. Washington - you would select the $29 reward level and pledge $109 ($23 + $65 + $15).\nWe will ask which add-ons you wanted in the project survey that will be sent out shortly after the project ends.\nThree reasons really. First \u2013 while sales of the first edition of Coup were good, and I am very optimistic about this special edition of the expansion - I am only able to offer it (with all the extra costs that it has) if I get a minimum number of committed backers.  \nSecondly, it is all about cashflow. The time between when I pay for games (now) and when I get paid for them is upwards of 7 months, and that is in the best of circumstances. That takes a lot of money sitting in inventory, and that isn\u2019t something that we have a lot of at this time of the year.\nThirdly, I really wanted to be able to get a lot of little extras made for the biggest fans of the game. Kickstarter really is a great platform to do that through.\nWhat are Kickstarter Funds used for?\nYour pledge dollars go directly into making the pledge rewards, and shipping them to you. We have invested in getting the project to this point where its ready, your support ensures that we have the cash to pay our printers to make the games - the most costly part of game production.\nAbout Indie Boards and Cards\nIndie Boards and Cards started in 2009 as an independent publisher of great game designs. In 2010 we released three games, all of which have been well received by critics and fans alike. Our biggest seller has been The Resistance - a game of secret identities, deception and deduction that is now or will soon be available in 20 languages around the world. In 2011 we released Flash point: Fire Rescue, which has also been very well received and now available (or soon to be) in 10 different languages.  In 2012 we released the humorous game of certain death - Gauntlet of Fools and in 2013 we added Coup and Snowdonia to our portfolio.   Be sure to look for all these great games wherever you shop. If your favorite game store doesn\u2019t carry our games, please ask them to!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIndie Boards and Cards has successfully delivered a number of previous kickstarter projects to thousands of supporters. We expect that our previous experiences will enable us to also deliver this project on time. That said there are always complexities and considerations in a project of this scope that may cause delays. Indie Boards and Cards will use contract manufacturing to make this game, freight forwarders to get games through customs and 3rd parties like Amazon, the US Post Office and FEDEX to ship the games to you - we don't control everything and there are lots of opportunity for delay. Other conditions may also cause delays - earthquakes, alien invasions, asteroid attacks, zombie plague are but a few of the myriad of reasons we may not be able to deliver this project in a timely manner. \n\nThis is a first edition of the expansion - by pledging to this project you are agreeing to be an early adopter and the extra items that are included in this edition (that aren't in the retail version) are your rewards and incentives for being an early adopter. But even with multiple edits, and constant proofing there may be minor typos, or grammar usage that is annoying to you in your rewards or other little things that would have been nice to have avoided but don't affect how the game is played. Mistakes that materially affects game play will of course be addressed but sometimes there are are minor errors that might be distracting but do not affect game play that I can't justify correcting. So if minor errors get under your skin and make it itch then you probably don't want to be an early adopter and are better off waiting till you've had a chance to see the final product and then buy it in your local hobby store. Kickstarter is not for everyone and I leave it to you to decide if you should be getting in on a first edition of this expansion.\n\nMy pledge is that I will deliver what I said and have written this project page as concisely and clearly as I can. So please read everything on this page - every kickstarter project is unique, and the commitments I am making to you regarding this project are completely defined here.\n\nA particular challenge to a project like this is negativity - I love your input, and really enjoy all the great suggestions that come from the large majority of our supporters. I can't include all the suggestions that I get, nor can I give you specific feedback other than noting that I do read all the comments and messages sent to me. So think before you post - threats, ultimatums and entitlement are unlikely to get you what you are asking for, and very likely that everyone else (myself included) will get less. \n\nRefunds - things happen and sometimes you need to get your money back. If you ask (before it's been submitted for shipment to you) , I'll refund your pledge less 20% to cover the costs that I can't recoup and costs of processing that refund. So think before you pledge - you can of course always remove your pledge before the funding deadline - but don't expect to get a 100% refund just because you forgot to remove your pledge before the project end ;)\n\nChanges - Images shown here are of the final art - however while it is not expected changes may be made before final production both to the art work and game contents. Variations in the production process and monitor calibration may cause alternations from the screen images to what appears in physical form.\n\nHave an issue? Send me a note - and please don't support us if you aren't satisfied with what the project is returning to you. Nothing would make me happier than having 100% of my supporters be 100% satisfied with their pledge rewards!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #30", "update_userinfo": "Our Quest ends tomorrow!", "update_content": "Our latest social deduction game by Don Eskridge, designer of The Resistance and Avalon is ending soon on Kickstarter!"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #29", "update_userinfo": "Coup Brazilian Art Deluxe Edition", "update_content": "Just a short update to let everyone know that the kickstarter for Coup Brazilian Art Deluxe Edition is up (and in it's final hours).

Nations were dissolved and the military folded into the company. These elite military and counter-security units have been given the acronym MERCS. They represent the tip of the spear. They are involved in everything from internal MegaCon security to reconnaissance and clandestine operations.\nLocated in the upper eastern portion of the North American continent, the CCC specialize in cheap, nanite-infused, custom-form metal manufacturing.\nCCC - Indianapolis Sweeps\nEU, Inc. represents the entirety of old Europe.

I've always tried to infuse a sense of action and energy into the concept art. I think you'll agree the sculpts do an amazing job of capturing this feeling.\nI've enjoyed revisiting the MERCS brand and giving it a fresh look. I hope you enjoy it as much as I have.\nBrian Shotton \u2013 Game Design \nFrom the very first days of MERCS, I wanted to make this game. I really dig Recon: the speed, the tension, the end game. I hope this game gives players an entry into the awesome world of MERCS.\nI have been in and around hobby gaming for most of my life. I have designed numerous games, including MERCS and Myth. \nTom Mason - Sculptor\nI sculpted the first MERCS. It seems like such a long time ago. It is hard to believe how far we have come. I have been involved throughout the process from the beginning, having sculpted many of the MERCS factions and several of the Myth figures (including Marcus the Ready and the Torchbearer).\nI now work full time with MegaCon Games and I can't wait for you to see what we have in store for you with MERCS: Recon. \nSpecial Thanks\nTo all of our family and friends who have supported us.

It is being fulfilled now, two months after the promised ship date. Not ideal, but pretty good by KS standards. We aim to do better with Recon.\n\nWe have expanded our group over the last year and have people on unique staff to handle fulfillment and the Recon KS. This new KS is even further along than the last one and we are much more ready to deal with the potential success. We really didn't know what to expect with Myth. It ended up being much larger than we could have foreseen and we were still able to get it in and shipping. We have waited to launch Recon because we wanted to get a KS under our belt so backers can be confident that we deliver our Kickstarters. Through the entire process of the KS (pledging, production, and fulfillment) we communicate.\n\nThrough MERCS and Myth we have produced miniatures, dice, books, cards, maps, and counters. From past experience, anytime we've dealt with sculptors, printing, and production in terms of timing, things can arise. We have successfully delivered multiple products produced in China, as well as dice produced in the UK. We understand that when it comes to anything produced overseas, delays can happen, especially with shipping and customs delays. Luckily, we have multiple people on the ground in China that shepherd our stuff from place-to-place and keep us updated in terms of where things are.\n\nWe've done our best to minimize unknowns as much as a company can, and we are always happy to refund pledges if for some totally unforeseen reason the game can't be delivered at all.

If you discover Tuscany after the project ends, you can order the retail version of the game (it\u2019s the same version you see here) on the Stonemaier Games website.\nThe creators of Euphoria bring you Tuscany, a pack of 12 expansions to Viticulture that unlock (\"uncork\") every few games as determined by the previous game's winner. What story will you tell as you create the most successful vineyard in Tuscany?\nViticulture is a 2-6 player game in which you create a vineyard by planting vines, harvesting grapes, making & selling wine, building structures, and hosting visitors. \nTuscany adds asymmetric starting resources, new visitor cards, an extended board, special workers, Arboriculture, and more (see rules and playtest PnP).\nTuscany cannot be played without Viticulture, which is available in several reward levels and as a $49 add-on. To learn more about Viticulture, you can download the rules, print and play it, watch videos about it, read some reviews, or view it on BGG.\nPrototype meeples created by PiasaPro.com\nYou can use the handy Fundafull pledge calculator to figure out your total pledge cost. Euphoria will remain on sale on our website until this project ends.\nAll stretch goals are fully playtested and are included in every copy of Tuscany (Kickstarter and retail).\nThanks to the worldwide fulfillment system explained on our Kickstarter Lessons blog here and here, we have very cost-effective ways of shipping Tuscany to you.\nWe can ship games to you in bulk if you coordinate a group purchase. Just choose your reward level and add the cost of each additional game to your pledge. Only pay the shipping fee once per pledge (any # of games, reward level, or country code).\nBackers in Asia, Australia, and New Zealand are likely to get their games a little earlier than everyone else because we'll ship their games from China (bulk or direct).\nFind all media mentions of Tuscany on our website and join the discussion about the game on BoardGameGeek.\nGeekDad prototype review by Dave Banks\nBoard Game Quest written preview\nThe Cardboard Republic written preview\nLeague of Gamemakers written preview\nTheology of Games written preview\nThanks to the multitude of amazing playtesters around the world who gave us their feedback on Tuscany! Anyone who playtests the game and gives us feedback will get their name in the rulebook.\nMoney-Back Guarantee: If you decide you don\u2019t like Tuscany within 1 month of receiving it, you can return it for a full pledge refund (see FAQ for details).\nEarly-Adopter Discount: Every copy of Tuscany ($45) comes at a 36% discount off MSRP ($70) as an appreciation of your early support.\nLimited Availability: We don't do Kickstarter exclusives anymore, but we'll only print a limited number of certain rewards based on the final pledge totals.\nWe Listen: We treat backers as collaborators\u2014we really value your input, and we promptly and transparently address all questions and concerns.\nBecause We Need You: We\u2019ve covered the cost of graphic design and art for Tuscany, but we can\u2019t manufacture and ship the game without your support.\nRough sketch of the collector's edition cardboard box (illustrated to look like wood). It measures approximately 10.5x8.5x8 inches and can sit upright or on its side.\nUncork all expansions in each tier in any order before opening the next tier. Here are the playtest rules and PnP (no graphic design on PnP).\nTier 1\nMamas and Papas: These cards give each player different combinations of starting resources to create varied priorities in the early game.\nPatronage: These cards give each player an incentive to make wine and a secret goal to accomplish, encouraging a diversity of strategies from game to game and a grand reveal at the end of each game.\nAdvanced Visitors: These cards offer players a variety of abilities that are good at all times of the game (most of these cards are in the format \"Choose 1: A or B,\" where A is good early in the game and B is good late in the game).\nProperty: These tiles overlay the fields on all vineyard mats and feature different maximum vine values and the ability to sell unused fields for money.\nTier 2\nExtended Game Board: This is a full game board with a new wake-up chart that creates a continuous flow from season to season and year to year, an influence map that lets players grab resources early and points late, and full worker-placement options in all four seasons, including several new actions.\nSpecial Workers: Similar to the grande workers, the special worker meeples are regular workers with one special ability each. This gives players the ability to not only choose where they place workers, but also which worker they will place.\nNew Visitors: Many of these cards let players break the rules of the game or generate interactions and tough choices for opponents to make.\nStructures: Flip over the extended board to side 2 and you'll find a number of orange card icons on it. They represent a new set of 36 structures that you can build on your vineyard and your new construction mat. They're drawn from a deck of cards (just like visitors or vines), and you build them with the build action. Every structure offers special ongoing bonuses and new action spaces, forming your strategy in a different way each game.\nTier 3\nArboriculture: This expansion gives players the ability to plant and harvest tomato vines, apple trees, and olive trees, create refined goods, and sell those goods with wine orders for points. Due to the extra strain on your workers, you have to keep an eye on their morale, which can either benefit or hinder you.\nFormaggio: The cheese expansion give players access to cows and four types of cheese to age in a cheese cellar. Several types of cheese experts are available on each player mat to impact the value of your cheese.\nMafia: In the mafia expansion, players are trying to present the best gift to a retired capo who is building his holiday home in Tuscany. Each grande worker carries your hidden gift, but if two grande workers end up on the same action, they have to switch gifts.\nThe Automa Expansion adds a set of cards to the game that lets you play Viticulture and Tuscany solo in campaign mode with varying degrees of difficulty.\nPhotos include prototype components. The final Farmer meeple (pictured with a staff) will not have a staff.\nWe faced a key decision when we started designing expansions to Viticulture: We could release expansions over the course of several years. That's what most game companies do, and we respect that strategy. Or we could do something different.\nWe decided to try something new: create an entire expansion experience while also offering people the best value for their money. Thus the idea for the Tuscany expansion pack: 12 expansions in one box.\nIt is a little odd for Tuscany to have a higher MSRP than Viticulture, but Tuscany costs more to make than Viticulture. To be fiscally responsible, we have to account for the fact that distributors purchase games at 60% off MSRP.\nIMMORTALE ($149): There are 32 new visitor cards in Tuscany, and we've divided them into two groups of 16 for gender equality. If you choose this level, you will need to take a photo specifically for your digital painting by Beth Sobel. \nEach visitor represents an adult who contributes to the needs of the vineyard, so the person on the card must be an adult (one person per card). These Immortale cards will be included in every Kickstarter copy of Tuscany.\nWe like to support game stores and wineries around the world by offering the special Kickstarter versions of our games to retailers during the campaign. If you're a retailer, please see our retail guidelines here and contact Jamey directly about your pledge.\nThis project is specifically to raise funds to make Tuscany. Independently, we are also printing second-edition copies of Viticulture--those files have already been submitted to the printer for pre-production. \nIn August, Viticulture will reach retailers, people who pre-order through our website, and backers who select Viticulture as an add-on (instead of the consolidated $79 and $99 rewards). We're able to offer those low prices by shipping Viticulture and Tuscany together in November, but if you want Viticulture in August, you may add it to any reward level (even the $1 level) for $49 or pre-order through our website.\nThe 2nd edition of Viticulture incorporates several rules changes, including the addition of the grande workers. These updated components are standard in every second-edition copy of Viticulture, and we will provide them for free in the Tuscany box for any current Viticulture owners (we'll ask you in the post-KS backer survey). We're trying to limit the number of upgraded components we mail individually to current Viticulture owners because of the expense and logistics involved, but we'll try to accommodate everyone as best as possible.\nphotos used with permission from boardgamegeek.com reviewer EndersGame\nEuphoria (retail version) is not available as an add-on, but you can order it from our website for immediate shipment during this campaign at a discounted price while supplies last (sorry, we only have copies in the US and Canada at this point, so shipping elsewhere is expensive). The Kickstarter version of Euphoria is not available.

Fortunately we have an ever-growing number of local and worldwide playtesters who offered us feedback over the course of the development process.\n\nThe main challenges we experienced with Euphoria that we will learn from are:\n\n(a) Amazon fulfillment isn't perfect, and occasionally a box might arrive slightly damaged (this happened on about 20 out of 5,000 copies of Euphoria delivered via Amazon fulfillment). For Tuscany we'll print replacement boxes to send to backers if needed.\n\n(b) In games with a myriad of components, sometimes a component doesn't make it into the box for a small percentage of the games. Thanks to a number of helpful Stonemaier ambassadors worldwide, we are able to get replacement parts to backers within a few days, and we've worked with our manufacturer to reduce the chances of missing parts for the future.\n\nThanks to our experience with Viticulture and Euphoria, we know exactly what goes into creating a high-quality game and delivering it on time. Stonemaier Games now has a worldwide supply chain set up to ensure punctual and cost-effective delivery to backers in almost every country. We're still learning, but we're slowly adding to our track record of success from Viticulture and Euphoria. We're also working with the same manufacturer again (Panda GM), so we know exactly what they need to produce quality product on schedule.\n\nWe tend to invest everything we earn from Kickstarter into making the best game possible. Any extra cash flow we have is from retail sales, which we are funneling into the second printing of Viticulture.\n\nStonemaier Games established an advisory board of industry veterans in January '13 to help us mitigate risks and challenges. So even though we will surely face new challenges in the future, we have an incredible team of experienced advisors to point us in the right direction.\n\nIf you would like to know more about what we learned from our Kickstarter experiences and research, go to www.stonemaiergames.com to see 80+ Kickstarter Lessons to help you create a successful project too.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #47", "update_userinfo": "Viticulture Moor Visitors Expansion", "update_content": "Hi!

When the Time of Peace came, it lasted so long that the God of  War started to lose his power. He grew weaker as the years went by and was pushed aside by the other gods. As his power faded and he felt that the end was near, he gave task to his four children, the demigods, to prove themselves as the most exemplary commanders on the field of battle. The one who emerges victorious will become the new God of War and bring the former glory to their name.\nDemigods Rising is a Skirmish-style board game in which players take the roles of the demigods, commanding armies of heroes to prove supremacy over others and ascend as the new God of War. As a demigod, a player initially has access to 20 heroes from which they can chose their army. With these choices made, a demigod then faces his opponent(s) on the sacred battleground.\nDemigods Rising game setup - 2 players - Tactics mode - 15 points\nWhen designing Demigods Rising we drew our inspiration from Chess, Heroes of Might and Magic and MOBA games such as DOTA & DOTA2 and League of Legends. We are bringing you a game with great replayability that is easy to learn but relies heavily on hard-to-master tactics through which victory can be achieved in multiple game modes by fulfilling different conditions.\nWe put in a lot of effort to capture the character of each hero in its illustration and its minis. Currently, we have several minis that are in pre-production phase. We will share them as they are completed. We are sure that the painters will love the detail captured in the models as we have already gotten great responses from those who have received prototypes of our finished models.\nBlack Wolf surrounded with Demigod Rising original custom dice\nDemigods Rising is not affiliated with the Warhammer 40k.

Any team can be countered with good planing and foreseeing your opponent's strategy. Take your best poker face to the table!\n- Demigods Rising features 38760 possible team combinations so you won\u2019t ever have to play with the same team. What\u2019s even better, this number of combinations gets higher as you decide to play with 7, 8 or 9 heroes. And that\u2019s only the base game. How\u2019s that for replayability?\n- Each and every hero we created has a comprehensive story showing them for what they really are - an individual worthy of fighting in a demigod\u2019s army!

You'll traverse the galaxy, exploring planets and battling other players to build up a strategic hand of cards.\nAs you progress through the game, you'll gather weapons and tactical equipment that help you discover, gain control of, and protect The Ovoid. This mysterious artifact is your civilization's last hope for survival, and you will have to use deception, misdirection, and strategy to outwit your opponents and possess it at the exact moment the universe collapses! By carefully balancing your hand of cards, spending your turn actions wisely, and cleverly using your alien powers, you'll maintain a grasp on the state of the game while plunging everyone else into chaos.\nRulebook: http://mirrorboxgames.com/ChaosmosRules1-5.pdf\nPrint & Play: http://mirrorboxgames.com/ChaosmosPnP.pdf\nQuick-Start Rules (on BoardGameGeek): bit.ly/1bqESda\nNew Strategy Video!\n\u2022 New Mechanic - Area-Specific Envelopes: Chaosmos uses a unique system in which each of the planets on the game board has a corresponding envelope of cards. When you land on a planet, you can take any of the cards there, leave behind cards you don't need, and hide cards for later. Special tactical cards can be left face-up to protect that planet from your rivals.\n\u2022 Alien Powers: Each player controls an alien character with powerful unique abilities that reflect their culture and personality. Atturnuk the Brutal may bludgeon enemies, while Drusu the Scryer can use telepathy to scout the Ovoid from afar. \n\u2022 Open World: Chaosmos is a sandbox-style game that gives you the freedom to explore many paths to victory. Each turn you can move in any direction, exploring new planets and choosing how to adapt your strategy as you discover new equipment. You can test out cool gadgets, protect caches of items, stock up on weapons, or anything else you can imagine.\n\u2022 The Ovoid: All players are vying for control of one singular victory card - the Ovoid. You'll have to carefully time your strategies to hold the Ovoid in the final turn to win.\n\u2022 Card Interaction: Cards will move organically around the planets, as players find uses for them. Most cards go back to your hand after you play them, allowing you to use them multiple times. By paying attention to what your opponents play, you can pick up cards that counter their strategies, giving you an edge the next time you encounter them.\n  \u2022  Facebook  \u2022  Twitter  \u2022  BGG  \u2022 YouTube  \u2022\nMore information about each alien can be found in the print-and-play pdf linked at the bottom.\nTom Vasel Video Review:\nUndeadViking Video Review:\nCrits Happen Video Review:\n\"I don't know that I've ever played a game like this before!

He is the producer and editor of the feature length documentaries The Inventor and the Daredevil and Pauly Shore Stands Alone. He loves games, and has designed and refined over a dozen card games, board games, and RPGs. Chaosmos is his dream project, and the response to it inspired him to start Mirror Box Games.\nMatthew Austin is the Lead Developer at Mirror Box Games. He developed the navigation iPhone app Falcon, which has successfully partnered with Insomniac Events and UCLA to provide walking navigation to festival attendees and incoming students. Prior to working on Falcon, Matt started and ran a successful home improvement company.\nDanny Vigour is responsible for the graphic design of Chaosmos. In the past, his mixed-media short films have earned him awards from companies as diverse as Sony Creative Software and Lea & Perrins Steak Sauce. Danny offered his help long-distance initially, but once the project got serious enough, he moved to California to join the team.\nSam Vest defines himself as a \"Freelance Videographer by day, artist all the time.\" He started as a Chaosmos play tester, but eventually became the demo runner at conventions, recognizable from a distance thanks to his signature top hat.\nChaosmos began as a personal project for me many years ago. I've completed several finished game designs, but this one is special to me. The response to the game convinced me that it was worth spending months testing and balancing, and ultimately publishing.\nIn January 2013, I decided to produce the game with my friend Matt. Old friends came out of the woodwork with endless love and support for the project, and my brother Danny moved to Los Angeles to work on it with me. We met with three major publishers at the Gama Trade Show and Gen Con, but ultimately decided to form a company and self-publish.\nFor a detailed history of the origins of the game, click here.\nWe've invested our own money into producing the prototypes and reviewer copies. With Kickstarter, we will have the flexibility and support we need to finish our art and components, and to deliver Chaosmos in a way that will stay true to our vision and make our fans proud.\n-Joey\n                                                                                                                               Rulebook:http://mirrorboxgames.com/ChaosmosRules1-5.pdf\nPrint & Play:http://mirrorboxgames.com/ChaosmosPnP.pdf \nLow Ink Rulebook: http://www.mirrorboxgames.com/rules.html\nPress Kit: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/0gy6rau6ij3hvft/hCuieoI6sX\nDisclaimer: Art and design for Chaosmos is not final and is subject to change.

In development for the last 2 years, this approximately 1/8\" thick mat has a specialized surface with more frictional or \"grip force\" than cloth, velvet, or any other material currently offered in the game accessory market. In addition to this, it can be printed in full color vivid images, and will survive common abuse that vinyl mats, and paper mats would not be able to withstand.  We need you, our backer, to help spread the word that a solution exists to table bumps, spilled sodas, and clumsy meeples.\nGripMats will hold tiles in place - like a champ!

In the shadow of the Copper Peaks, a battle for control of the realm has begun. Will you further the expansion of The Royal Kingdom of Heads or will you help The People\u2019s Republic of Tails fend off the threat of an invading empire?\nIn Coin Age two players attempt to control the land of Agea using a single card map and a handful of pocket change. Players take turns placing their forces (coins) on the map to control spaces, outmaneuver their opponent, and score victory points.\nCoin Age is a quick-playing area control game with lots of player interaction that uses an innovative \"coin slap\" mechanic to determine available actions. On your turn, you will take one of each of your remaining types of coins into your hand (1 quarter, 1 nickel, 1 penny, and 1 dime), shake them up, then slap them down on the table. \nDepending on the number of coins that match your \"side\", you are then able to either place coins on the map, move previously placed coins to an adjacent space, or remove them altogether. \nWhen placing coins, you may also place your coins on top of your opponent's coins if your coin's size/rank is smaller, so while a quarter will give you the most victory points at the end of the game, it is the easiest for your opponent to cover.\nI know that it can become confusing with Stretch Goals what exactly you might be getting for making this pledge.  First and foremost, you get the awesomely fun game play of Coin Age.  \nThe materials in the envelope however are:\nOriginal Coin Age map card\nDurable \"credit card\" like material with original Coin Age map.\nDoubloon Lagoon Map\nFrozen Assets Map\nLave Map (Cool Name Pending)\nRules\nCardboard coin tokens.\nStickers to apply to real currency if desired\nZip baggie to hold all of the stuff.\nWant to try Coin Age before you support this campaign? (Or want to play it while you eagerly await delivery of the official version?) Download the Print & Play version from BGG or by clicking here. It\u2019s free!\nOr just read and check out the rules at those links above.\nAt TMG, we REALLY love games and publishing games.  Towards the end of 2012, we wanted to be able to provide fantastic games that are also micro.  Not just micro components and a micro footprint, but also a micro price.\nIt wasn't until about September of 2013 that we figured out a viable method for providing games like these at a quality level fans of TMG have come to expect.  Sure, we could provide fancy print-and-play games, but that doesn't scream high quality and high value.\nSo, we have embraced a pay-what-you-want methodology with one modification, a minimum level.  $3 is very close to our actual cost to get the game to you.  At the suggested pledge level of $5, then we (TMG and the game designer) make a decent amount from your pledge.\nMost of all, we want to be able to bring these great tiny games to you, your friends, and your family.  If this project goes well, then we will be able to bring more like this to you in the future as well.  So, please share this project with your friends.\nWe want Coin Age to be as good as it can possibly be, but that requires us to make more copies of the game, which means that we need more funding.\nSo, as we pass certain levels of funding, we will unlock the following increases in the quality of the final game that EVERYBODY will be getting:\n \"If I want to mail a simple letter in Demarks it costs me a dollar and a half. Creating a game and shipping it worldwide for 3 dollars is some kind of super power.\" - Potential Coin Age Backer\nHi everybody! Thanks so much for checking out my game. Coin Age has been a passion project of mine for the past year, and I\u2019m blown away by the overwhelmingly positive feedback I\u2019ve received since debuting it at Gen Con. \nI wanted a way to get the game in front of as many people as possible, and when Michael approached me with his \u201cPay What You Want\u201d idea, I felt like it was a perfect fit. I love Kickstarter. I\u2019ve backed over 70 projects with no sign of stopping. I think Kickstarter can be an incredible tool for games like Coin Age that would otherwise never be published by the traditional model.\nI didn\u2019t set out to make money with Coin Age. It came out of the desire to always be able to carry a small, engaging game with me and be able to play it wherever I go. Something that could fill the time before everyone showed up at a game night, or something I could play with a friend while waiting for our dinner at a restaurant. \nI started with the idea of \u201crolling dice\u201d with coins, playing with multiple uses for their double-sided-ness, and evolved these ideas into an area control game with a fun/silly theme. Coin Age has been playtested over and over and over and over, then again and again, and after that more and more and more to make sure it was as tight, streamlined, and as minimal as possible while maintaining enough choices to make it interesting. \nI have a special place in my heart for the game, and I really hope you will see it the same way.\nAdam was the illustrator for the hit microgame Council of Verona, and won the Boardroomers 2013 game design contest. He has worked for the past 7-8 years as a package designer for multi-million dollar brands, but hopes to one day create board games full-time because he apparently does not understand how money works.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nTMG is pleased to be bringing to you another incredible micro game.

Being huge fans of the sci-fi genre, we wondered why spaceships feel so empty? What\u2019s missing? Looking back to all the TV and Movies that inspired us, like Star Trek, Battlestar Galactica or Firefly, we realised games are missing something integral: a crew. A ship without a crew feels hollow and meaningless, so we\u2019ve taken space travel to the next level. The dangers of space should not only test your metal, but your flesh.\nWe wanted to make a game where you\u2019re not a solid, singular object in a sky-box; you are a captain in an evolving, dynamic ship that hundreds of people call home. They adapt to you, and grow with you as you fight alongside them, and if you suffer losses, you\u2019ll feel the loss that comes with that.\nThat\u2019s where the drama is, that\u2019s where the story happens, and it\u2019s the interacting with people on the deck that makes this a complete experience.\nWe want to create a complete sci-fi RPG experience.\nWe want to explore the war-torn depths of space, engage in political intrigue, lead troops on the deck of a ship, command a fleet from the bridge, and sate our thirsts for glory \u2013 and we want you to join us.\nFor the first time in a game of this type, players will be able to board vessels taking the combat into an RTS environment whilst your friends still fight from their ships in space.\nAs the captain of a ship, you\u2019ll lead your men through battles, boarding operations, and space exploration through a hierarchy of officers, selected and honed by you.\nYou\u2019ll explore your vessel isometrically, discovering the inner workings and day to day life of the officers and crew who serve under you. Invite dignitaries to your chamber, or defend your vessel from attack on foot (in the style of Jagged Alliance, X Com.)\nAs you lead your men to victory, yourself and officers who survive will have access to upgrades and talents, affecting gameplay and offering new tactical opportunities. Make the wrong decision, and expect to lose your officer for good with our rogue-like chain of command.\nConcept for ingame Bridge view\nBattles from space are orchestrated from the classical perspective (Star Trek Online, Klingon Academy, Freelancer, etc.) Whilst in this view, your crew will take their battle stations within the ship, affected by hazards \u2013 even being sucked out of a hull breach. Whatever happens outside of the vessel, affects those within it.\nBoarding operations allow you to isometrically zoom in on your units, or zoom out into Space Battle View at your disclosure. Fight the war on two fronts. Battle in the style of games like Men of War at the same time as fighting battles reminiscent of Klingon Academy.\nTrust your crew? Allow them to fight autonomously, and deal with the ships hands on.\nConcept for ingame boarding\nOur modular design will allow you to build your ships (link to Ship designer) and space station to fit your play style. With thousands of combinations, and the potential for thousands more over the period of the campaign and launch, it\u2019s possible to create something completely unique.\nChange the design for tactical, defensive, and strategic capabilities \u2013 skin, colour, and mix-and-match to your heart\u2019s desire. \nThe Mandate is a sandbox RPG (similarities with Pirates! And Mount and Blade), allowing you to travel the galaxy through a series of jump-gates, opening doors to new systems.\nIf you or your friends are in trouble, instantly jump to their location from outside of the game using Steam.\nEach system of the universe offers a series of procedurally generated content which varies every time, as well as hand-crafted story-driven content for you to take advantage of. What you do in The Mandate is entirely up to you, but as you gain power and unlock more systems, you\u2019ll drive the story forward.\nWith new factions to be found in each sector, and Starbases to be scavenged, looted, and built, watch your empire grow as you conquer and explore the depths of space, where new quests and unexplored territories will reward the most experienced of captains.\nAt its core, that\u2019s The Mandate \u2013 a fantastical space RPG about betrayal, scavenging, exploration, combat, and honor. These elements are eloquently wrapped in an all-original history and lore, waiting to be discovered.\nWith both iterative and entirely unique mechanics and concepts, we\u2019ve been inspired by franchises such as X Com for our upgrading system, Fallout for scavenging and survival, Battlestar Galactica for the sense of home and community, crewmanship, Star Trek Online and Klingon Academy for space battles, and Jagged Alliance or Men of War for RTS style boarding operations. We\u2019re taking the best of what was, and reinstating the old-school \u2013 and we\u2019re confident we\u2019re doing it right.\nWe've written 1500 years of history. It's up to you to write the future. The explorable reaches of space mix hand-crafted and procedurally generated content and is packed with historically relevant easter-eggs offering insight into the Mandate's rich lore.\nEach level of the game, from the political tier of warring empires, through the strategic level of individual star systems and naval battles, down to personal interactions with other characters impacts on how your story develops.\nThe decisions you make in Mandate affect the world around you, and your crew. Every action has a consequence, and as you push your ship to the farthest reaches of the universe, diplomacy, and morality are pushed with it.\nAffect the world with your actions, not with your words. The Mandate will not be challenged with a dialogue wheel.\nIn the far future, mankind has abandoned the exhausted, dying world of Earth and gone on to colonize hundreds more worlds. These colonies were united under the rules of the Imperial Mandate, and linked by faster-than-light travel gates. As civilization continued to expand, corruption within the Mandate and dissent in the outer systems fomented a rebellion against Imperial rule.\nThe untimely death of the last Emperor gave the rebels their opportunity. The military was recalled to his state funeral and the investiture of his successor - a young and inexperienced Empress who took the throne with limited political support. Seizing the moment, the outer systems declared their intention to break away from the Mandate.\nThe Empress dispatched the Grand Fleet to restore order, but saboteurs redirected the travel gates, and the fleet ended up scattered across the galaxy. The Empress was left vulnerable without the protection of her navy.\nDesperate times called for desperate measures. The Empress founded the Corsairs, a new fleet captained by disgraced ex-Mandate officers jailed for breaching the Articles of War. Reinstated under the promise of redemption, these veterans are the last hope of the Mandate. You are a member of the Corsairs. With a small ship, you must move swiftly and make your way to the far reaches of Mandate space. Your mission - to discover the fate of the Grand Fleet and restore order to the outer systems.\nThere was a time when gaming wasn\u2019t about running through a corridor, firing off rounds into hordes of enemies. There are hundreds of mechanically magnificent titles out there on PC, and hundreds of teams equipped to make them. The only reason they\u2019ve declined is that they don\u2019t sell as well as something you\u2019d find on the consoles. We want to change that, and we have the knowledge to do so.\nThe Mandate is an ambitious title, but we are tackling each of the core elements with equal attention. By making each gear in the mechanism function correctly and optimally, our end result will be something mechanically interesting, with a lot of depth.\nWe\u2019ve taken inspiration from some of the finest strategy and RPG titles from past and present; working iteratively with their ideas and concepts. These are ideas that have worked in the past, but unfortunately declined with the changing PC gaming demographic. We know you\u2019re out there, and we\u2019re bringing them back. With tried and tested game mechanics, and some completely original ones, all it takes is the knowledge to bring them together \u2013 hard-earned knowledge that our team members have gained through years of games industry experience.\n\u2022 The ships of The Mandate are modular designs, allowing us - and you - to manually mix and match various parts, or to randomly generate any number of designs for the game world.\n\u2022 One of the themes of The Mandate is that ships are home to many of the world\u2019s inhabitants. Space stations and ships will be our cities. They are naturally much smaller than lunar structures \u2013 however, there will be many of them.\n\u2022 Whilst much of space in The Mandate is hand crafted, there are also procedurally generated areas to keep things fresh and offer replayability and interesting battle options in multiplayer. This allows us to offload some of the work to a complex world building algorithm.\n\u2022 Most importantly, we have experience building massive worlds. Many of our team hail from some of the most successful MMO projects ever created.\n\u2022 We\u2019re careful \u2013 using several middlewares to streamline development and reduce risk, increase efficiency, and most importantly, avoid wasting time. Unity3D is a great tool for this.\nCreating a new RPG world isn\u2019t easy, what have you done differently?\nThe biggest mistake a storyteller can make in gaming is to believe they are writing the future. The future is up to you: the gamers. Because of this, we\u2019ve taken the time to do a lot of research into building a believable past. We believe the story to be so important to The Mandate, that we\u2019ve written 1500 years of history based on Tsarist Russian lore and history. What if the Tsars ruled space?\nThe Mandate is part alternative-history, part fantasy. You\u2019ll be writing the future in The Mandate, it\u2019s simply our job to provide you with the context. Throughout our kickstarter period, you\u2019ll be introduced to our characters, how they\u2019re designed, their names, and their pasts. Even you, the player, will be able to choose your path from families dating back to the Tsarist period. The world of The Mandate did not happen spontaneously \u2013 there are reasons for the way that it is, and throughout this campaign and the games launch day, you\u2019ll enjoy exposition and story updates offering insight into our rich new world.\nWe are an international team: Canada, USA, Sweden, Norway, UK, France, Slovakia.\nWe are a team of veteran developers who decided to go Indie together and come from different game developers each with their own strengths [ex-EA, ex-2K Games, ex-Ubisoft, ex-Funcom]. Previously we have worked on and shipped both singleplayer, multiplayer and MMO AAA productions with team size ranging from 30 to 200\nSome of the titles we have worked on and shipped include: Assassin's Creed 1&2, Mafia 2, Alan Wake, FarCry 2&3, Age of Conan: Hyborian Adventures,Call of Duty 3, Splinter Cell, Planet of the Apes, Saga of Ryzom, FIFA ONLINE, FarCry Evolution, Rainbow 6 Vegas, The Secret World and more.\nPlease refer to the FAQ for full team statement. Portfolio links:\nGarret (Art Director)\nVegard (Tech Director)\nWe are big fans of sci-fi, be it video games or series like Battlestar Galactica, Star Trek, Babylon 5 or Firefly. We are CRPG players and some of our favourites are Fallout, Baldur's Gate, The Witcher, Gothic, but we also remember classics like Ultima 7 or Microprose's Darklands. We are strategy players and have fond memories of the original X-Com, Carrier Command, Jagged Alliance and more! We love pen & paper tabletop: D&D, Pathfinder, Deathwatch, Traveller, Shadow Run and more! And also we are board game geeks: Warhammer, Warmachines.\nWe plan on taking all our inspirations, hobbies and diverse development experiences to ensure we deliver a game you will want to play for many hours both alone in dark space and together with your captain friends.\nTier reward information can be found here.\nCLICK HERE for digital add-ons. If you wish to pick a digital add-on simply increase your pledge by the corresponding amount. E.g. if you wish to name a marine ($25) and get the base game with soundtrack ($20) then you would pledge $45 in total and pick the $20 reward tier. After Kickstarter is over, we will transfer your unused credits over to BackerKit where you can spend them on digital add-ons. \nKickstarter is the preferred backing avenue but if you for some reason cannot use Kickstarter, then you can visit our PayPal store.\nReward tiers that grant extra copies [so $150 and above] also include the Cossack Captain tier (alpha, beta, season pass etc) for each extra copy.\nWe have put a lot of thought into thinking about fairness \u2013 especially when it comes to games and their PR and marketing teams. For this reason, to say thank you for your vote of confidence reflected in your pledge amount, we are putting our entire marketing team in the darkest airlock on-ship.\nThey have each been issued a \u201cFairness Directive\u201d, a set of rules they have to follow to make sure there is a coherent and direct flow of information between you and the developers. They have been ordered to be firm, frank, and fair.\nRewards are certainly mentioned in the Fairness Directive, and we will not be selling alpha or beta access at inflated prices. We believe access to the game should be included in the relevant pledge tiers, and we should not profit from your willingness to provide feedback. You are part of the team, and we respect you.\nTherefore, as the pledge tiers scale, you\u2019ll see access to exclusive content that we consider real value for money. Many of these will not be sold separately, and you will not see some of them sold on Steam. They are a thank-you for your continued feedback and support, and there is some exciting stuff such as the Season Pass (access to the first expansion pack and content updates), and access to all early builds of the game (pre-alpha).\nAs you continue to browse the tier pledge rewards, you will even get a chance to completely change the game, and leave a permanent mark on the world of The Mandate. \nRemember, any breach of the Fairness Directive will result in a swift ejection through the airlock, replacing the guilty party with a robotic AI (they are cheaper to feed, anyway).\nAs the Empress placed her trust in the Corsairs securing her a grand victory, your trust is well placed in us!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nUPDATE\nSome backers have asked to see a clearer cost breakdown. We will not be providing a \u201ccake diagram\u201d as we believe that gives a false sense of security. Instead we have put together a development timeline to illustrate the allocation of manpower for the different stages of development. Keep in mind we are on Indie salaries. The Kickstarter campaign will cover the positions outlined and some devs are prepared to work for free as an additional buffer.\n\nhttp://ships.mandategame.com/images/20131015_KS_dev_budget.png\n\n\u201cWe are taking the pre-production process very seriously indeed. The combat prototype has been in development for almost a year, and only a subset of it is shown in the ship designer. We will get back to this in more detail later in the campaign. \n\n\nPre-production features a skeleton size unit of full-time staff. Other staff are kept informed of creative decisions and when their roles will be needed once production starts. This saves time, money and allows the skeleton team to focus their efforts. Once the production tools are ready, we will ramp up and assign additional full-time staff to their positions. Additionally, we have no big corporate HQ and minimal expenses. Our producer does not have a driving license and as such expenses for company cars will be minimal... (but we might buy him a bike!)\n\nWe are economically efficient, utilizing resources (such as your pledge money) in the best ways possible. We do contingency planning and set aside buffer time to have a reserve. We have funded the prototype so far with side-income and by working late nights.\n\nOur staff understands our budget limitations and the implications for roadmaps and scheduling. We will only hire for position X when it is necessary -not before, and since we have access to a large network of game industry professionals this simplifies the recruitment process. Because we have a clear focus we do not need to give people a task to do merely because they are sitting around. This would be inefficient and wasteful. We will not have Day1 DLCs for the Mandate, and our focus is on delivering the best possible experience at launch to everybody who buys the game. Proper content updates and expansion packs will be planned before launch but developed after based on input from the community, particularly the Kickstarter donors who are our bosses.\n\n\nOn the technological side, Unity3D (the game\u2019s engine) comes with a working world editor, a build system for creating versions of the game, and the ability to deploy to multiple platforms including Windows, Linux, and Mac. It has its own eco-system with 3rd party plugins which we purchase for a reasonable price and can use in our project. This saves us time and allows us to do things like push the visual fidelity with one example being TC Particles which allow GPU accelerated DX11 particles. Check out the ship designer and study the impact effect on the shields. It just looks awesome. TC Particles is just one example and we have other bigger plugins or middelware available to us as well like a stable, tried and tested network engine which we have already gained valuable experience with. This greatly reduces the time and effort needed beyond integration, bugfixing and maintenance. \n\nOur team has half a century of game development experience between us, including major MMOs. This is a much smaller project than an MMO, which traditionally demands very capable content production tools. We are taking our combined knowledge and experience to setup and structure efficient workflows and production pipelines. This includes decoupling dependencies between art, code and design to minimize the amount of wait-time and avoid blockers. \n\nMiddleware is the key and we would prefer to license something which has been tried and tested rather than reinventing the wheel. This frees us up to focus on the game and avoid unnecessary distractions. At the moment, we are evaluating several character creation middleware tools which will make the process of setting up characters a breeze for the artists. At the same time players will have access to extensive character customization options. A common theme for both art and game design is to apply a modular and reusable approach. On the art side the procedural textures are an excellent example and if you have tested our ship designer, you will appreciate the versatility it provides even at this early stage. On the design side we are heavily data-driven: our tools must support major changes to content without requiring the involvement of programmers, which would create unwanted dependencies and blockers. \n\nOne final point to make, if you inspect our reward tiers you will see that we do not have any physical rewards. This means we do not divert Kickstarter funds to produce physical goods and instead we can use the funds to fully realize the actual game. To compensate for this we are providing what we believe are fair reward tiers where backers even at lower tiers get to put their mark on the game. Higher tier rewards are bundled with additional copies of the game so backers can split the cost among friends.\n\n\nStill, we understand that some backers would prefer physical copies and merchandise and here is a promise:\n\n\nOnce our funding goals are reached, we will add physical reward tiers and outsource the production and shipping to our backers who will pay for only production and shipping. If people want t-shirts made we will supply the graphics to make your own t-shirts or other merchandise. We will not make a dime off of you ordering that set of China with the Empress Anastasia on it that you always wanted. We are game developers -not Manchester United! \n\n\nTo summarize: we have the necessary know-how, experience and technology, and our overhead is minimal. The Mandate is the love child of some very experienced game developers who all want to see this project succeed. We are doing smart things with smart technology and will pick the right tools for the job to optimize the work-load and streamline our production pipelines and workflows. This allows us to produce content in modular blocks which is more efficient and allows us to reuse, thereby saving time. \n\nSo could everyone and their grandma make The Mandate for $500,000? Probably not. Can we? Hell yes we can.\u201d\n\nRemember: One rule, no quarter. With efficiency, a driven vision, and a careful understanding of what made traditional strategy games and RPGs so great, The Mandate will delve deep into mechanics of old, iterating and improving on them, ultimately delivering a vast and unique RPG experience.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #67", "update_userinfo": "Latest community Update", "update_content": "Dear backers,\nIn March we went through difficult times, the team size was reduced to only a core team since January, as consequence of the still ongoing negotiations with our publisher about the remaining funding.

This includes the additional copies in the combo packs and international combo packs.\n*Dr. Boom is a game originally printed as one of our wallet-sized micro-games. Dr. Boom can be played using specific character cards that come within the box of Two Rooms and a Boom. All of our backers will get the instructions on how to play this devilishly clever 2-5 player social deduction game. That means this box now supports 2-30 players instead of just 6-30 players!!!\nTwo Rooms and a Boom! is a social deduction, hidden role game. Unlike other hidden role games, there is no need for a moderator. Each game is timed (so you know it won't last too long) and you can do whatever you want with your character card, including showing it to other players (that's identity verification). \nAt the beginning of a game, players are equally distributed between 2 separate playing areas (usually 2 separate rooms) and then each player is randomly dealt a facedown character card. There are 2 teams, the Red Team and the Blue Team. The Blue Team has a President. The Red Team has a Bomber.\nEach room has a leader selected by the players in that room. The leader chooses hostages (players who will be sent into the other room at the end of the round). \nThe game consists of 3 timed rounds. Each round is shorter than the previous round. At the end of each round, the hostages selected by the leaders will be traded into opposing rooms. If the Red Team\u2019s Bomber is in the same room as the President at the end of the game, then the Red Team wins. Otherwise the Blue Team wins. \n\"After demoing it for about eight hours, I can safely say that Two Rooms and a Boom is game of the year material.\" - Quintin Smith, Shut Up and Sit Down\n\n\"If you read my previous review for the recently released Mascarade, you will remember I suggested that it would likely be my top game of 2013. While I still love Mascarade, that previous comment only remains true because Two Rooms and Boom will not officially be released until next year.\" - Charlie Theel, 2D6.org\n\n\"Personally, I\u2019m eagerly awaiting the Kickstarter release of the game, and I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll be a oft-played alternative to other late night gaming activities.\" - Ted Alspach, designer of Ultimate Werewolf, owner of Bezier Games, reviewer for Opinionated Gamers\n\"Taking party gaming to the next level...\" - Michael Fox, Little Metal Dog Show\n\n\"Unique take on hidden roles...\" - Drew, Giant Fire Breathing Robot\n\nRead some more great reviews and testimonials.\nThe reason Two Rooms and a Boom was nominated as \"the most anticipated party game of 2013\" on BoardGameGeek.com is because the game has been played worldwide by hundreds of people. The game is currently available for Print-n-Play (PnP) for free on our website, and will continue to remain free for all.\nAlso, we have an amazing group of loyal players that play Two Rooms and a Boom on the BoardGameGeek forums regularly. Chances are really good that they're playing a game right now! So go check out the game there and get in on a Play-By-Forum (PBF) action by clicking here. They're a friendly bunch that are always looking for more players.\nOne of the greatest things about Two Rooms and a Boom is that the game can get as complicated or simple as you want it to be. Besides the basic character cards, there are 36 advanced character cards that come with the base game! These advanced cards can drastically alter the way the game is played. Each of these characters have been thoroughly playtested and refined for your pleasure.

If there is a delay in delivering our game, it is likely to come from one of 3 main sources, artwork, manufacturing quality control, and freight logistics.

We see a wider release at Origins (Columbus game convention) as critical to the short-term and long-term sales success of Two Rooms and a Boom.

It combines the fun of a deckbuilding game with the interactivity of Trading Card Game style combat. As you play, you make use of Trade to acquire new Ships and Bases from the cards being turned face up in the Trade Row from the Trade Deck. You use the Ships and Bases you acquire to either generate more Trade or to generate Combat to attack your opponent and their bases. When you reduce your opponent\u2019s score (called Authority) to zero, you win! \nThank you all for getting us to our funding goal! Time for some stretch goals:\n You now may add playmats to any reward tier that has a physical component!\nTo include add-ons in your pledge, simply increase your donation by the appropriate amount and send us a message via clicking on our profile and hitting the \"Contact Us\" button to let us know what you want. We'll also send around a final survey after the end of the Kickstarter to confirm everyone's choices. You can add any number of each add-on item to your pledge, as long as you have pledged to the minimum designated tier.\nStar Realms will be released as both a physical card game and as a digital game for PCs, Macs and mobile devices. The entire physical card game will come in a single deck box that you can easily carry in your jacket pocket, backpack or purse.\nThe game consists of:  \nOne 80 card Trade Deck \nTwo 10 card Personal Decks, consisting of two Vipers and eight Scouts each \n10 Explorer cards \n18 double-sided Authority cards for keeping score \nOne Rules Sheet \nEach of the cards in the 80 card Trade Deck is a Ship or a Base belonging to one of four factions: The Trade Federation, The Blobs, The Star Empire or The Machine Cult. \nIn the far future, the more traditional governing bodies of the human race have been replaced with corporate leadership. The earth and its surrounding colonies are ruled by a group of corporations called the Trade Federation. The Federation\u2019s policies are focused around trade and growth, but especially in profit and prosperity for those at the top of the corporate ladder. While they prefer to deal with other star realms using trade and diplomacy, they have a large defense branch dedicated to protecting the Federation\u2019s trade and other interests.\nIn Star Realms, the Trade Federation specializes in generating large amounts of Trade and in gaining Authority (increasing your score).\nThese mysterious creatures are the first alien life forms encountered by the human race. Most of the initial encounters consisted of human colonies being completely obliterated. On the few occasions that a Blob ship has been recovered somewhat intact, the only biological remains found inside have consisted of a gelatinous mass, thus leading to the moniker, \u201cThe Blobs\u201d. While for several years all encounters between humanity and the Blobs have been extremely violent, there is currently some limited trade between various Blob factions and some of the more daring human traders.\nThe Blobs are best at generating massive amounts of Combat and at removing undesirable cards from the Trade Row.\nThe Star Empire consists primarily of former colonies of the Trade Federation. These colonies were on the outer edges of the Federation. Not only did they feel used by the corporations, but they felt the Federation failed to give them adequate protection from the Blobs. As a result, one ambitious colonial governor was able to unite several colonies into an independent empire under his control, one with a strong military, both for warding off the Blobs and for discouraging the Federation from trying to reclaim their lost colonies. \nThe Star Empire is a combat oriented faction that draws lots of cards and makes the opponent discard cards.\nA cluster of industrial mining worlds were completely cut off from the Trade Federation by the Blobs. With the threat of annihilation by the Blobs always looming and no contact with the rest of human space, these worlds were forced to take drastic measures. Soon a cult of technology arose, focused on using advanced technology, robotics and computerization to create strong defenses and a powerful military that belied their relatively small population. Since their leaders believed their salvation lay in technology, technology soon became their god and their religion.\nThe Machine Cult gains most of its power from being able to remove undesirable cards from your deck and from having a large number of Bases designed to defend your Authority from attack.\nWhen you play Star Realms, you will be able to acquire and use Ships and Bases of any and all of the four factions. Many cards have powerful Ally abilities that reward you for using Ships and Bases of the same faction together, however.\nAs you acquire cards using Trade, you put them into your discard pile, to be later shuffled into your personal deck. When you draw Ships, you do what they say and they get placed into your discard pile at the end of your turn. When you draw a Base, you play it face up in front of you and may use its abilities once every turn. In addition to Combat being the way you reduce your opponent\u2019s Authority to zero and win the game, it\u2019s also useful for destroying your opponent\u2019s Bases. Some Bases are designated as Outposts. Your opponent\u2019s Outposts must be destroyed before you can use Combat to attack your opponent\u2019s Authority directly. \nStar Realms is easy to learn, especially if you\u2019re familiar with deck-building games, but it\u2019s a game that takes time to master. Each time you play, the game is filled with various strategic decision points. Should I take the best card for me or the best card for my opponent? Should I focus on taking cards of a particular faction or on taking the best card available? Should I be focusing on acquiring more Trade or more Combat? Should I attack my opponent\u2019s Base or their Authority? These are just some of the many choices you\u2019ll be faced with. New players needn\u2019t agonize over these choices just to play, but as they become more advanced players, they will find this depth of strategy leads to great replayability.\nUnlike most deckbuilding game kickstarters, Star Realms is offering both a physical and a digital version of the game. Star Realms digital will be available on multiple platforms: PC, Mac, iOS and even Android. You\u2019ll be able to play Star Realms digitally from the comfort of your home or on the go. The digital game will include the ability to play against an A.I., pass and play with your friends, campaign mode, online play and even online tournaments! You can start by honing your skills playing against the computer and by battling your friends. When you're ready for an even greater challenge, you can take on the computer in campaign mode or you can test your mettle playing against top competition in tournaments. We will offer both asynchronous and live tournaments, so you can either take your turns at your leisure or enjoy the experience of playing at live speed.\nWhen we will be able to provide each of these awesome features will depend largely on the level of success of this Kickstarter campaign. Reaching our $20,000 goal ensures that we will launch the beta digital version for the PC and the Mac (target release date of March 2014). The beta version will allow you to play Star Realms against an A.I. and to pass and play with your friends. Over time, we will increase the number of platforms to include iOS and Android. In addition, we will gradually roll out features such as online play, online tournaments and the campaign mode. The more we exceed our $20,000 goal, the faster we will be able to add each of these features and the cooler we will be able to make them.\nWe are very proud of Star Realms and we can't wait to get the game out to you. Star Realms has beautiful art and graphic design. The physical game packs into a small, portable deck box that you can bring with you anywhere. It's a great product at a great price, and most importantly, the game is incredibly FUN to play!\nStar Realms links:\nOfficial website: www.StarRealms.com \n2-Player Rules: Rulebook (PDF)\nBoard Game Geek TV: How-to-play video interview with Rob at GenCon 2013\nCool Stuff Inc.: GenCon 2013 video interview with Rob\nGeekenstein: Interview with Rob\nZero Fortitude: Star Realms Preview\nDigiboard Games: Star Realms Preview\nThe Nerd\u2019s Domain: Star Realms Impression\nQuietspeculation.com: Star Realms Impression\nMeepletown: Star Realms Impression\nPower to the Meeple!: Audio Interview with Rob\nGaming Trend: Kickstarter Review\nGeekenstein: Star Realms Preview", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nCreating a deckbuilding game is no small task.

I am a visual engineer/artist, and for the past few years I have been designing flam3 fractals for use in light and projection shows, art installations and as contributions to Electric Sheep.\nThis project called \"A Flame a Day\" is all about generating fine art quality fractal artwork and distributing it to the project backers.  A portfolio of ten (10) recently designed seed flames plus the creation of one (1) new flame for each of the thirty (30) days of this project, for a total of forty (40) fractal images.  Backers at higher pledge levels will have a unique fractal flame created and distributed just to them.\nI will be using the funds from this project to print museum quality Gicl\u00e9e  Canvas prints to be displayed at my upcoming gallery shows and installations.  Funds will also be used to make and distribute the backer rewards.\nAll Daily Flames created for this project (except the unique backer flames) can be found in the image gallery at - seculargeometry.com... or check this project's update section to see all the daily fractal flames including the unique backer flames..\nThe Art of Breeding Fractal Flames\nThe way I create a flame is much like the way a biologist would breed a more colorful flower or sweeter fruit. Algorithmic patterns called genomes define what a flame looks like just as our DNA defines us. I will take a genome and mutate it by manipulating the equations assigned to the transforms of the flame. After mutating I will mathematically cross the genome with another flame's genome to produce a new flame. I repeat the mutate and cross sequence with new flames until one is produced which has the dynamic characteristics and visual appeal that I am looking for.\nFor example, to produce a new flame from seed flames 4 & 9 below, I would move their numerical algorithms into the breeder and come up with many different variations of the flame combinations.\nFlame creation using Oxidizer\nAfter choosing 'the one flame' and modifying it with the addition of random equations, I now have something I can move to a genome editor for further tweaking.\nFlame manipulation using the fr0st editor.\nIn the editor, form and spacial concepts are worked out and refined, as well as color selection and balance.\nFlame tweaking done and ready to render\nThe flame is then rendered out and final manipulations are done to enhance colors and add background shading.\nFinal flame adjustments made using GIMP\nWhen everything is ready to go, the final large format image is rendered out to 9600 x 6600 pixels (printable size larger than 5 feet by 3.5 feet).  Below is a thumbnail of the new flame which is 1/20 the detail of a project flame.  Final project artwork is several times the resolution of the detailed view of the new flame.\nNew flame from seed flames 4 & 9\nDetail view of new flame\nThis process of randomly choosing flame genomes from the flame stock to produce a new fractal flame will happen daily for the thirty (30) days of this project, producing a total of forty (40) project flame fractal artworks.\nBesides the new daily flame, a unique fractal flame image will be generated for each backer pledging $50 or more to the project.  This image will ONLY be distributed to the backer for which it was created.\nSeeding the Flame Flock\nIn preparation for this project I created the following ten (10) fractals to seed the flame flock.  The genomic algorithms from these flames will be crossed, mutated and hand manipulated to create the new daily fractal flames, and the new flame genomes will be added to the available breeding stock.\nSeed Flame #1\nSeed Flame #2\nSeed Flame #3\nSeed Flame #4\nSeed Flame #5\nSeed Flame #6\nSeed Flame #7\nSeed Flame #8\nSeed Flame #9\nSeed Flame #10\nDaily Flames Mean Daily Updates\nThis project will be updated each day with the image of the newly created daily fractal, as well as any unique backer fractals from the previous days pledges.  Check this project's updates daily to see the ever expanding fractal image gallery & flame flock.  By the end of the project, all of the project's forty (40) fractal flame images will be on display here as the seed flames or in the updates as the daily flames.  All unique backer flames will also be displayed as updates for all to see although each unique backer flame will only be distributed to the backer it was designed for.\nLimited Gicl\u00e9e Prints for Backers\nThe museum quality Gicl\u00e9e Canvas printed as backer rewards will be the very first printing of any of these images, and will be limited to 12 total prints.  I will be doing the gicl\u00e9e printing myself, as well as the finishing and stretching of the canvas onto a wooden frame.  I only use the finest materials including Archival Certified Breathing Color Lyve canvas and Timeless finish to yield a 100+ year print life when properly displayed and stored.  Each print will be digitally signed and numbered.  If multiples are printed of any image, the backer's pledge time/date will determine the series number they receive (earlier pledges get lower print numbers).  The prints will also be hand-signed by me the artist once stretched on a frame.\nReward Distribution by Disc\nEach fractal image produced will be rendered out to 9600 x 6600 pixels... files detailed enough to produce fine art quality prints as large as 64 x 44 inches (larger than 5 x 3.5 feet).  Since these files are extremely large and there are lots of them, they will be distributed to backers via one or more optical data disc (DVD).  Backers at the lowest pledge level will be given a download link to the image of their choice.\nAll images from this project are distributed free of copyright or royalty, and may be used by backers for any purpose private or commercial.\nA survey of backers given at the conclusion of this project will collect all information needed to distribute the rewards.

After practicing for this project for several weeks, I feel confident that the project mission can be accomplished on time or with minimal slippage even if it means going without eating and sleeping at times.\n\nTechnically, I have identified the following as potential risk:\n\n(1) Hiccup in the render farm - I will be using a combination of six (6) individual computers networked together to do the creation, editing and final rendering of the project's images. If one (or even two) of the computers decides not to cooperate, the remaining machines will be able to finish the job, although at a slower pace. Everything will be done possible to keep the 'A Flame a Day' workflow from slipping.\n\n(2) Printer problems - in the event the gicl\u00e9e printer malfunctions and needs repair, the shipping dates for the Gicl\u00e9e Canvas prints could be extended... all effected backers will be notified of any shipping delays.\n\n(3) Internet connection down - even if I loose my home connection, there are multiple local library Internet connections available to upload the daily project updates.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #33", "update_userinfo": "BIOptiSonic Me Fractal Art Kickstarter Launched", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #32", "update_userinfo": "Backer\"PV\" Flame", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #31", "update_userinfo": "Daily Flame - 30 October, 2013", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #30", "update_userinfo": "Daily Flame - 29 October, 2013", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #29", "update_userinfo": "Daily Flame - 28 October, 2013", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #28", "update_userinfo": "Daily Flame - 27 October, 2013", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #27", "update_userinfo": "Daily Flame - 26 October, 2013", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #26", "update_userinfo": "Daily Flame - 25 October, 2013", "update_content": ""}, {"status": [{"Project funds successfully": "36 backers pledged $1,337"}]}], "comment_no": 3, "projec_url": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/221524246/a-flame-a-day", "project_name": "A Flame a Day"}}, {"backer": "Ryan Wolfe", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Thank you, CBS!\nThe Star Trek Continues fan-based, non-profit production respectfully and graciously thanks CBS, the holder of the Star Trek rights, for allowing fan-films of this great show! Without their support of the fans\u2019 love of Star Trek then web-based, fan-produced shows like ours would not be possible. Their understanding of the passion that the fans have for their property is second to none and we are so appreciative for their support by allowing this activity.\nIntroduction\nStar Trek Continues is a non-profit, fan produced webseries that was launched in May 2013 with its first episode, \u201cPilgrim of Eternity.\u201d The show is being produced to complete the final two years of the original 5-year mission. Our inaugural episode brings back original series guest star, Michael Forest as Apollo. The accuracy of the sets, lighting, filming and the quality acting and characterization brought great praise and support from Star Trek TOS fans all over the world.\n(Video below is full episode with running time of more than 51 minutes)\nThe Details\nWe've made a first episode that we're really proud of. Now we want to make more! If we can raise $100k, we can make 3 original, all-new episodes. \nWe're not paying ourselves! The money goes to hard costs related to the development, filming, and post-production of these episodes, such as:\n\u2022 Set construction and materials \n\u2022 Building rental and maintenance \n\u2022 Monthly utilities costs \n\u2022 Equipment rental \n\u2022 Prop production and replication \n\u2022 Costume rental and production \n\u2022 Make up equipment and supplies \n\u2022 Cast and crew travel, lodging, and food during the shoots \n\u2022 Post production costs, hard drives, online data storage, etc. \n\u2022 Plus a million other little details! \nThe Stretch Goals \nIf we are fortunate enough to exceed our goal, additional funds will go towards making more and better episodes. We are just getting started! If we exceed $200k, then new production opportunities may open up, such as expansion of our sets and perhaps even our own facility, including an indoor planet surface setting like was so often featured in TOS! \nBut we'll cross that bridge if we come to it!\nThe Accolades\nThere have been many reviews of our webseries' inaugural episode, some by the elite of fan-based websites such as TrekMovie.com and io9, among others. Check out some of the reviews here:\nLaughing Squid: Star Trek Continues Fan-Made Webseries\nFan Film Review: Star Trek Continues\nSlate: The Trek Continues\nio9: Star Trek Continues - My Mind She Is Blown\nFan Production Star Trek Continues Releases First Episode\nSubspace Communique: Watch The Star Trek Continues Webseries\nIn addition to the fan site reviews, many of our fans took the time to reach out to us about our show and they are excited to see more:\n \"I can see a great deal of love and care went into the production of this web series and I wholeheartedly applaud you for it. To think I can see a continuation of the original series in this fan-made form is pure joy.\" - Ozne R.\n\"I watched with pleasure the first episode some time ago and it stirred a lot of memories.\" - Rick B.\n\"For years I have been jonesin\u2019 for years for new episodes of ANY star trek series. Watching this was an exact experience of a new episode of the original series. Once I got used to the new faces about half way through it was like the original series in every way! We NEED MORE episodes!\" - Dean M.\n\"This episode had me hooked from beginning to end, and I loved that little easter egg at the end.\" - Vanessa E.\n\"You hit absolutely everything right. You matched the style without it feeling dated. You caught the actors and characters spirit without them feeling like impressionists. The story was compelling, meaningful, and in the true spirit of ST:OS...with a kind moral. Fantastic.\" - Ryan R.\nHundreds of fans have emailed us, and they all have had similar sentiments as above, regarding the first episode of our series.

Designed to introduce new players to the rules, as well as give experienced players a unique adventure filled with mystery and fear, it can also be inserted into an existing campaign, to provide a break from an adventuring group\u2019s normal story arc.\nThe module will also include six pre-generated player characters: a group of heroes who comprise one of the \u201cacquisition arms\u201d of a well-known university, braving the wilds of space and the mysteries of the past to gather knowledge and exhibit-quality relics for their patron institution. Often working \u201cunder the table\u201d, they specialize in going into dangerous locales and sometimes skirting local laws and customs to investigate history and bring back their finds.\nThe adventure begins at the time of unusual events in the Arah System, where recent attacks on ships near the Arah Asteroid Belt have garnered galaxy-wide media attention. Survivors claim the attacking vessel is a ghost-ship, Dugan\u2019s Hand. A notorious pirate vessel in the days of the Old Republic, Dugan\u2019s Hand disappeared within the Arah Asteroid Belt centuries ago, without a trace. As media speculation abounds, the university has seized on the opportunity to capitalize on it, and has sent our heroes to explore the Arah Belt and discover the remains of Dugan\u2019s Hand. The party will have to investigate clues and the history behind the ship, as well as the recent attacks, ultimately braving treachery and hidden adversity to discover the secrets of a long-dead pirate and his mysterious demise! \nStretch Goal Rewards!\nWe are amazed at the outpouring of support from listeners - and we want to say thank you by giving you some MORE content for your SWAG packs!

Completing missions, besting ships in combat, purchasing higher tier ships, selling Cargo Cubes and claiming Titles are all ways that players can earn Fame Points. The best pilots will adapt to their surroundings, making snap judgments and changing plans on-the-fly. If you can think on your feet, you'll do well in Xia!\nSandbox: The real fun of Xia is that each game will be different. There is no set direction of play, players may choose to be peaceful traders, fierce pirates, workers, miners, opportunists, etc. The game board is randomly laid out and explored each time you play. Players might choose not to explore at all, creating a tiny arena for swift and deadly combat, or explore all 19 sectors and have a large play-scape to exploit. It's up to you!\nDon't take our word for it!\nUndead Viking posts a 50 minute epic preview:\nDice Tower's Tom Vasel has posted an awesome overview of Xia:\nTom Vasel also mentions us in his May 20 news post!\nCheck out James Floyd Kelly's in-depth preview!\nPreview by James Floyd Kelly\nWhat makes Xia awesome?\n\u2022 Stacking ship powers: Each ship has a unique special ability. When you purchase a new ship, you get to keep your previous ability, allowing you to stack up to three abilities for powerful combinations!\nClick to enlarge\n\u2022 Pre-painted ship miniatures: 15 gorgeous and inspired miniatures (12 player ships & 3 NPC ships).\n3D printed prototypes, not final versions.\n\u2022 Legal / Illegal Missions: Legal missions are a great source of income and fame for upstanding citizens. However, a captain can make more money outside of the law, but at greater risk.\nClick to enlarge\n\u2022 Bounty system: You can choose the quick an easy path...but it will cost you. Illegal acts will make you a wanted fugitive, operating on the fringes.\n\u2022 NPCs: 3 NPCs each with their own agenda that fly and interact with players and each other. A villainous Scoundrel, the unyielding Enforcer, and the wealthy Merchant.\nClick to enlarge\n\u2022 Exploration: Exploration is engaging, dangerous, and fun! You start each game with only a small portion of the system revealed. There are two ways to explore: You can stop your ship, spend valuable energy, and scan a nearby sector. Or you can blind jump into the unknown, maintaining velocity, but possibly flying into danger! You decide: Gamble? Or play it safe?\nClick to enlarge\n\u2022 Variable game length: Choose how many points to play to at the start of the game. Feel like a quick rush for points? Or an epic adventure? It's up to you!\n\u2022 Titles: Think of Titles as \"achievements\" that randomly come up as you play.When you stride into the spaceport bar others will whisper of your exploits... become the \"Dare Devil\" by flying through a dangerous asteroid field or the \"Velocity Warden\" by racing across the system.\nClick to enlarge\n\u2022 Trade system: You can buy cargo to fill your hold and sell it at a profit, but you can also mine, salvage, or harvest goods, though those options are not without their own risks. If your ship is full of cargo, other players may target you to try and take the goods for their own!\n\u2022 Energy system: Will you be able to make it two more sectors to deliver your cargo? Or should you take the safe route and go out of your way to refuel? Managing your ship's energy is an important part of Xia.\n\u2022 Damage system: When you take damage you have to decide where your ship is hit. Will you take damage on your engine, crippling your ship? Or will you sacrifice your valuable cargo, watching it spiral out to space as you flee for your life? \n\u2022 Delicious flavor text: Each Mission has a story to draw you deeper into the universe. Every ship has a \"Back Story\" detailing how you came by her, as well as a \"Victory Story\" which you get to read aloud to your friends when you win!\n\u2022 Multiple paths to victory: Every path has its strengths and weaknesses. Combat is totally optional (but totally awesome). There isn't one \"best\" strategy. A good player will adapt, plan ahead, and stack the odds to win!\nClick to enlarge\n\nWhat about 3D printing and modding?\nIf this project is funded, we will fully support 3D printing and modding! The goal is for players to be able to create their very own starships, complete with Ship Cards, Special Ability Cards, and Miniatures!\nThat sounds great, but let's get specific:\n1. We'll release Ship Card, and Special Ability Card templates. These will be Adobe Illustrator or Photoshop files. With these templates you'll be able to make your own custom ship cards for your creations using the same art we're using to print Xia!\n2. 3D Printing - We will release a mini-expansion of at least 3 NEW official ships that you'll be able to print out using a 3D printer. These ships will have Ship Cards and Special Ability Cards that will only be available to print yourself!\n3. We'll release \"How to's\" and tutorials on how to create your very own starships! Not a 3D modeler?  No problem, we'll show you where you can hire an artist! Don't have a 3D printer? No worries! You can use www.shapeways.com to print out our 3D files. Or make your own and have them printed there!\n4. If the community is excited, we'll try and be a hub where players can share their creations and find new ships to print*!\n(Note: To create 3D models you'll need a modeling program, like Blender)\n*Obviously we can't host anything that's copyrighted!\nWhy Kickstarter?\nMy name is Cody Miller. Xia: Legends of a Drift System is my passion project, it's my dream.\nIt's just me. There's no big company, no media machine, no team of artists. I've poured the last 7 years of my free-time into this game. The only help I've had has been from Steve \"Coolhand\" Tyler (http://coolhand.cgsociety.org) who created the awesome 3D models and 2D renders of the starships. Everything else I've done myself (with the love and support of my gorgeous wife and amazing sons!).\nIf this was a video game I'd upload it to Steam and see how things went, but a board game takes quite a bit of money to get started. Especially if you want pre-painted miniatures!\nI work full time, I'm a full time student, I have a wife and two boys, my paychecks are instantly transmuted into diapers and electric bills...\nI realize that the goal is very high, I didn't want to compromise on cheap cardboard components, or generic plastic pawns, I wanted painted miniatures, and something I would feel had a great value.\nI began looking at Kickstarter last year, and it seemed the perfect solution, so that's why I'm here.\nThank you for your support, I am very excited for you to play Xia!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRisks come in mostly logistical forms.

You'll manage an economy, field a fleet of warship, and command companies of Marines. Use clever tactical options and special game-changing events to destroy everyone who stands in your way\nHull Breach is a game for two or more players and uses both cards and dice.  A 1v1 game might be over in 15 minutes, but the more players you add, the longer and more complex the game becomes!\nThe Corporate Wars box set with all included elements.\nHull Breach Corporate Wars comes in a box set with: \n3 fully-playable-right-out-of-the-box decks\n10 ten-sided dice\n20 Explosion/wound tokens\n10 Jammer tokens\n10 Target painter tokens\n10 Economy gems\nRulebook \nFiction supplement, an introduce to the story behind the Corporate Wars\nEverything you need to play will be in the box! Even though this isn't a CCG, you can still tear down your decks and reassemble it with any number of combinations of cards that you can think of and forge your own playstyle!\nWe've already brought an Alpha version of our game to market in New England, proving that the concept works and people are hungry for more.  We've taken fan feedback gathered during that run (rules, tweaks, art, packaging, and more) and applied it to our next phase - Corporate Wars!  It's bigger, better and shinier than ever before, and ready for a nationwide release!\nHere's a video we shot at The Game Den in Warren, R.I., explaining a little more about the key points of the game.\nThe goal of the game is to capture or destroy your enemy's space station and defend your own. How exactly you choose to do that is up to you, but you'll be able to leverage many different types of cards towards that end. \nEach Commander starts the game with a space station in play.  From there, you draw cards, manage your per-turn income, and balance your offensive and defensive production against that of your opponents. To do this, you'll draw up to five cards every turn and tally up your per-turn economic gain, which depends on how you configure your station.  Are you a financial powerhouse, or do you focus on military strength at your station?\nAfter that, you'll be able to deploy ships, Marines, and equipment that modifies them to bolster your forces.\nYou can then launch your fleet across the stars at your opponent - once your forces arrive in his sector of space you have two main methods of destroying him: use your Marines to board and seize his ships and station, or use your raw firepower to turn those same ships and station into twisted wrecks!\nThere are many classes of ships, ranging from tiny drones to enormous capital ships, each with its own strengths and weaknesses - some excel at confronting enemies head-on while others are relied on to perform vital support tasks in combat. \nWhen you're not slinging dice and destroying ships like a pro, you can also use slightly more devious methods to defeat your enemies!  Powerful Event and Tactic cards can tip the balance of power dramatically, either by manipulating economies and production or implementing clever battle strategies to influence combat results.\nBut Hull Breach! strategy goes beyond the cards and the dice.  Your own command abilities will factor significantly into your success or failure!  Knowing when to strike, what to strike, and how to strike are the marks of a truly great Commander.\nDon't take our word for it; here's a great video review by the good folks at Skip the Rules!\nIf you want more detailed info about the Alpha rules and the Corporate Wars rules check out our website!  \nHere you'll find our Pledge Tier levels.  You'll notice that some of the items on each image are locked - as we meet our stretch goals (more on those further down), items in our Pledge Tiers will become unlocked and the Tier upgrade - without any further cash on your part!

This will be supplemented with non-randomized Reinforcement packs to fine tune your play style and potentially Scenario packs as well.

My name is Whitfield. I'm an artist living and working out of Austin, TX, and this is my first Kickstarter project. First off, thanks for stopping by! Whether you become a backer or not, I genuinely appreciate you taking the time to look at what I've put together. Secondly, my VIDEO will be posted shortly, so if you like what you see, then be sure to keep an eye out for it in the following days.\nCompleted drawings of \"Jupiter\" and \"Half Moon\" (December, 2012)\nSummary:\n\"Our Fathers\" (art of heaven), is a series of original, highly detailed charcoal and graphite drawings of planets, moons, and stars. Everyone who buys an original drawing will receive ALL of the following: 1. Descriptive email updates as the project moves along (including photographs of my process and more), 2. High resolution PDF copies of ALL finished drawings, 3. An original, framed, signed drawing of your choice, 4. A photo-journal of your EXACT drawing, from pencil sketch outline all the way to completion, and finally, 5. A small note about your image in particular (when, where, and how the image was photographed, as well as a few fun facts and figures regarding the planet, moon, or star itself). The completed drawings will look like this (these are drawings I've already finished and framed):\n\"Solar Eclipse,\" and \"Half Moon,\" framed in black (December, 2012)\nWhy am I doing this?\nI've been passionate about art for nearly twenty years now, and I've been drawing and painting for as far back as I can remember. I've never pursued art professionally, though I've always dreamed of doing it. Recently I've been creating art for my own home and I've had several people express interest in my work. I've done some work for a few friends, and it's made me happy. I would love to continue doing it, not just for friends, but professionally. This is where Kickstarter comes in -- Kickstarter provides me with the perfect opportunity to take my first step into the professional art space by selling my artwork directly to You, my potential backer.\nBelow is a close up image of a study for \"Half Moon\" (12 x 12\"):\nDetail of \"Half Moon,\" (December 2012)\n(Note: for additional details surrounding the project -- including several more pictures of completed drawings -- simply scroll down towards the bottom of the page.)\nWhat inspired me?\nSeveral months ago I started following the \"Astronomy Picture of the Day.\" It's become a habit for me to check the website daily (check it out, it's awesome! http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/astropix.html) and I'm always amazed at how truly bizarre and yet incredibly beautiful the images are. As I was thinking of what theme my project would take on, I realized that I was staring right at it -- drawings of these strange and yet wonderful worlds that are both so close us (in our \"galactic back yard,\" so to speak) and yet so far away...\nWhat will the drawings look like?\nThe following images will be available for purchase as original 12\"x12\" charcoal and graphite drawings:\nCrescent Moon:\nSource photo for \"Crescent Moon\" drawing\nSolar Eclipse:\nSource photo for \"Solar Eclipse\"\n\"Starry Night\" (also available in 12\" x 16\"/16\" x 12\"):\nCompleted drawing of \"Starry Night,\" sourced from various photographs (December, 2012)\nHalf Moon:\nSource photo for \"Half Moon\"\nJupiter:\nSource photo for \"Jupiter\"\nEarth in Shadow:\nSource photo for \"Earth in Shadow\"\nSolar Flares:\nSource photo for \"Solar Flares\"\nSaturn (up close):\nSource photo for \"Saturn\"\nLet's see some art!\nHere are several studies I've prepared of the images above:\n(Note: ALL of the following images are drawings in charcoal and graphite.)\nHere is an example of a study (a preliminary drawing) for \"Jupiter\" (12\" x 12\"):\nDetail of \"Jupiter,\" (December, 2012)\nHere is the same drawing hanging on my wall in a white frame (12\" x 12\"):\n\"Jupiter,\" framed in white (December, 2012)\nHere is \"Jupiter\" again, alongside a study for \"Solar Eclipse\" in a black frame (also 12\" x 12\"):\n\"Jupiter,\" and \"Solar Eclipse\" (December, 2012)\nHere is \"Half Moon,\" framed in black (12\" x 12\"), next to a study for \"Solar Eclipse,\" framed in white (12\" x 12\"):\n\"Solar Eclipse.\" and \"Half Moon,\" (December, 2012)\nHere are several studies for various images, including \"Solar Eclipse,\" \"Crescent Moon,\" \"Starry Night,\" and \"Jupiter\" (all 12\"x12\"):\nVarious drawings, (December, 2012)\nHere is a close up of \"Crescent Moon\" (12\" x 12\"):\nDetail of \"Crescent Moon,\" (December, 2012)\n\"Crescent Moon\" can also be drawn at an angle, as pictured below:\nDetail of \"Crescent Moon,\" at angle (December, 2012)\nBelow is a study for \"Starry Night,\" shown 16\" x 12\":\n\"Starry Night,\" (December, 2012)\nAnd here it is framed in white (12\" x 12\"), next to \"Eclipse 2\" framed in black (12\" x 12\"):\n\"Solar Eclipse,\" and \"Starry Night,\" (December, 2012)\nHere is an example of a \"Supporter\" level reward (\"Reward #3) -- a signed and framed pinted hi-res copy of a drawing of your choice (\"Half Moon\" is pictured below, 12\"x12\"):\n\"Half Moon,\" hi-res print framed in white (December, 2012)\n(Note: although not pictured, all completed drawings will have a small signature in white on the lower right corner -- both prints AND originals).\nAnd finally, here is a close up of a hi-res print of \"Crescent Moon\" (12\"x12\"):\n\"Crescent Moon.\" hi-res print (December, 2012)\nWhy is the project called \"Our Fathers?\"\nFunny name, right? Let me explain myself so it doesn't sound so pretentious... My favorite astronomy quote comes from Carl Sagan (astronomer, astrophysicist, author, etc). In his popular TV series titled \"Cosmos,\" he stated (quite famously) that we are all \"made of star stuff.\" And, of course, he was right. Nitrogen, calcium, iron, carbon, and hydrogen -- the elements that combine to make up our physical bodies -- were all forged within the furnaces of ultra-hot collapsing stars more than a billion years ago. In this sense, we are looking out at the origins of life itself when we look up into the busy night sky. Very cool thought. In fact, when we peer into the deep and seemingly eternal blackness beyond our atmosphere, we are looking \"back in time\" in more ways than just one; not only are we looking out at the celestial bodies that formed the elements of life itself, but the very light that hits our eyes has crossed vast amounts of space in order to reach us, meaning that the images we perceive are, themselves, images from the past. (The light from Saturn, for example, takes well over an hour to reach us.) This is what I was thinking of when I titled the project.\nWhat is the project EXACTLY?\n\"Our Fathers\" is a series of highly detailed, \"photorealist\" style charcoal and graphite drawings that depicts the mysterious and ancient beauty of these far away celestial bodies. High definition images from a number of different sources have been gathered -- images of the Earth, the Sun, the Moon, stars, a solar eclipse, Jupiter, and Saturn -- and these images will be drawn in exquisite detail using charcoal sticks and graphite pencils. I will be careful to create images that are as close to the originals as possible, capturing as much of the intricate interplay between light and shadow as I can, while still allowing some room for artistic interpretation. Put another way, I want these drawings to look like drawings up close, but to look like pictures from farther away. \nWhat do you get?\nEVERY contributor gets artwork. Depending on which level you commit to, you will either receive a PDF (along with detailed updates of the project as it moves along), a signed and framed high resolution digital image of an original work of art, or an original work of art itself that is also both signed and framed. The images take several hours to complete, and I have tried to price them as fairly and competitively as possible, while still accounting for the time, cost, and effort put into creating them. Every image in the series of drawings will be drawn by hand, so NO two images from this series will be identical. Those who purchase original drawings will also receive several pictures of their drawing in progress, so that you can see exactly how your drawing was created, from beginning to end.\nWhen (and how) will I get it?\nThe moment the project is funded, I'll get to work. I live right across the street from a Fedex shipping center, and will be shipping out each drawing as soon as it's completed. One thing -- charcoal is NOTORIOUSLY messy. Therefore, in order to prevent any possible problems with smudges, scratches, bends, or any other potential damages to your drawing as a result of the packaging and shipping process, ALL DRAWINGS will be shipped already neatly framed and carefully bubble wrapped. Remember, both white and black frames are available, so please specify which color frame you would like. Project funding will go towards art supplies (charcoal sticks, graphite pencils, high quality paper, erasers, etc), framing supplies, shipping costs, image licensing fees, and, finally, the creation of the drawings themselves. I'll consider the project a success if it funds ($2,000 goal), meaning that I get to complete and ship out at least 10 drawings. But my REAL goal is for the project to COMPLETELY sell out. If this happens, then I'l get to send out just under 60 drawings to 60 people across the country, and that would be amazing.

Walters. It addresses a wide variety of topics including aging, loneliness, the nature of monstrosity, mountain lion hunting, amphetamines, wild horses, the Burning Man festival, the Bureau of Land Management, the battle over water rights in Nevada, and having a child with Down syndrome.\nMost of the stories in the book center around the imaginary community of Hualapai, which is loosely based on the infamous town of Gerlach: best known as the home of Burning Man, and one of the most isolated communities in the modern West. It's heroic characters are inspired by the rugged, individualistic, and sometimes tragic people that inhabit the beautiful but bleak landscape of rural Nevada.\nThis is the second edition of An Unforgiving Land, containing an additional story (Crucified Coyote) and nine relevant essays published by Jason over the last decade. It has been expanded to 110,000 words and carefully edited by Carol Darnell. Only 200 copies of the first edition were ever printed \u2013 and those sold out shockingly quickly. Additionally, backers will receive an electronic copy of the never-before-seen story Insiled Kinfolk \u2013 a brand new Hualapai story!\nFinally, backers and potential backers will be able to read the story Crippled Stray - a favorite of the author's - in the form of ten updates posted during this Kickstarter.\nWhat The Critics Have To Say!\n\u201cThese are horror stories. But what makes them unusual and evocative is that the horrors rise right out of the rocks and sand and flora and fauna of the desert. A Judas horse, trained to help men bring in herds of mustangs, realizes it\u2019s turning its own kind into dog food \u2014 and rebels. Hunters encounter a cat that is \u2026 well, just a little bigger and wilder than all the rest. A lonely old lady invites a pack of coyotes to do a deed that she herself cannot. Even the meth cookers are a little crazier, a little more violent, and quite a lot stranger in this bleak land. But if you\u2019ve spent time in the desert you\u2019ll almost believe these things could be real.\u201d - Claire Wolfe, www.backwoodshome.com\n\u201cA tribute to the people of Gerlach.\u201d \u2013 Reno Gazette Journal\n\u201cThis collection of horrific short stories from Nevada\u2019s Black Rock Desert will give you nightmares for years to come.\u201d \u2013 Dave Mattingly, The Algernon Files\n\u201cThis book may need a warning label: a possible side effect is that your mind will become altered.\u201d \u2013 Marge Fulton, All Roads Lead to Hazard and The Holler\n\u201cThe skillful structure of the stories is matched by Walter\u2019s wordcraft. He evokes the danger and beauty of the Black Rock environment in spare terms that, over time, allow the reader to get to know the place.\u201d \u2013 RobotViking\n\u201cIn the introduction of An Unforgiving Land Jason explains the the book is a love story to his home and the Black Rock Desert. That is really what this is in a horrific and twisted sort of way. The tales meander to different peoples, places, and events giving the reader a bitter taste of this desolate place.\u201d \u2013 Kingbeast\u2019s Lair\n\u201cEight well written but dark and stark tales of life in and around Hualapai on the Black Rock Desert.\u201d \u2013 Alternative Worlds\n\u201cI frickin\u2019 loved reading An Unforgiving Land. Like many, my introduction to the Black Rock Desert was through Burning Man. But over the years as the newness of Burning Man has waned, the call to the desert has waxed. There is something deeply American, rugged, mysterious, independent \u2013 something Cowboy that comes out in me when I visit this place. In An Unforgiving Land the author trapped into this resonance and took me there from the cozy confines of my Seattle condo. If, like me, you feel the call of this haunting place \u2013 with or without Burning Man \u2013 do yourself a favor and buy this book. You won\u2019t be disappointed!\u201d \u2013 Peter Adkinson, GenCon\n\u201cJason Walters\u2019 tales are violent, lustful, and more than anything else, compelling. The sex demon of Burning Man is, alone, worthy of iconic stature. At once obvious and unthinkable, she-who-cannot-be-denied is one of the great creations of contemporary literature. The stories of wacko cowboys, tattooed postmodern crazies and supernatural fauna at first appear unrelated, but they build to a narrative of place \u2013 and end-of-the-road, out-of-chances, desperate kind of place that is both the real Northwestern Nevada and a state of mind. You will never see the West the same way again. You will never hear the wind rustling in sagebrush without reaching for your gun, even though you know the shots will not save you. When you read Walters, you enter a parallel universe that leaves you creepily unsure of your own, forever.\u201d \u2013 Donald Asher, author and lecturer", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs general manager of Hero Games I've completed two prior Kickstarters and fulfilled our obligations toward their backers without any problems.

Grey sunlight shone feebly through the curtain of white. Joe slumbered peacefully on the floor in his spot, the slits on the sides of his nostrils flaring and un-flaring as he snored softly. She smiled tenderly at him. It was hard to imagine a better friend to have when the credits finally, inevitably rolled on the end of her life. Before things finally went to black and the curtains tumbled. Quietly she left the room, latching the door behind her as she went.\nWithout dressing, she walked out onto her rickety porch and from there out into the ankle-deep snow. The cold dug into her withered flesh but she didn\u2019t care. She kept walking and, as she did so, used her mind to call out to the Hand of Death: summoning it from beyond, pulling it in from the hidden reaches of the Playa, and the Granites, and the Calicos. Summoning her end as surely as the final shovel of dirt falling upon the surface of a newly buried grave."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #10", "update_userinfo": "Crippled Stray: Part Ten", "update_content": "Finally, Maude had had enough. She\u2019d made sense of the dream. Joe was calling to her from heaven through the most intimate bond possible. What other explanation could there be? She was just stalling because she worried that the new Joe still needed her and because she was frightened of dying, but that was a sad excuse. He would be fine, and she had killed so many chickens and rabbits with her bare hands that being anxious about her own death seemed cowardly to her. She wouldn\u2019t even have to do anything but call up the Hand of Death. They would take care of it. If Joe hadn\u2019t kept interfering, she would happily be little more than frozen coyote scat and a gnawed skull under the sagebrush somewhere. They had come before. They would come again."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #9", "update_userinfo": "Crippled Stray: Part Nine", "update_content": "The winter continued as if there had never been anything but winter. Life was an equal mixture of gray skies, powdery snow, mud, and cold. Maude waited to catch pneumonia \u2013 or at the very least to fall down, break a hip, and then catch pneumonia. It just didn\u2019t happen. A lifetime spent on a ranch had made her tough even in the twilight of her years. She was old, but not actually frail. When she fell down, it just hurt. Nothing ever broke.\nMaude had always wondered why rural Nevada had the highest rate of suicide in the country. Now she knew. If you survived to midlife out in the American Outback, unclaimed by alcohol or traffic accidents or cigarettes or uranium tainted water, violence, or anything else, odds were good that you were hard to kill. It was possible to linger on, to continue far beyond your expiration date into a sort of half-death in which your dreams were gone and the people you loved were gone and the world you knew was gone, but somehow you were still there. You and the big empty land, the snow and yourself... and yourself... and yourself: an exclamation point standing in the center of an unforgiving land, waiting for God to strike you down as He had everything else in your world.

He was no fucking Mother Teresa.\nRusty sincerely told himself this even as he maneuvered his battered, highly modified Chevy K-10 across the frozen surface of the Playa toward Maude\u2019s isolated ranch. He was a small man that was somehow also big. His mother had been short, short-tempered, and very Irish, his father shorter, shorter-tempered, and even more Mexican. Both were from Nevada, and had never visited the nations that gave them their self-proclaimed identities. The resulting genetic brawl left Rusty with carrot red hair (now going gray at the temples), dark features, a prow-like Aztec nose, and the bulky, slope-shouldered physique of a power lifter: which he had been for a while after getting out of the Army for the first time."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #7", "update_userinfo": "Crippled Stray: Part Seven", "update_content": "The two of them settled into a routine of sorts.

Then he patiently hobbled after her as she went through the ritual of her morning chores, not actually helping with anything, but always willing to listen to what she had to say. This was a considerable comfort to the old woman. It had been many years since Maude had had anyone around to talk to. There were occasional visitors, of course, but with them, she hoarded her words in a manner peculiar to deep desert folk. It was as if there was a limited supply of words available to a rancher for the duration of his or her life, making their careless use as unthinkable as wasting food, water, or some other valuable resource. Yet around him, words began to flow out of her tight lips like spring melt pouring over the sides of a badly maintained irrigation ditch. There wasn\u2019t any need to organize her thoughts into the clipped, careful sentences she was accustomed to allowing through her lips, either. She could speak all she liked in an unthinkable wealth of words, never pausing to worry whether the jumble of verbiage made sense in the context that she uttered it.

She\u2019d used her old rusty pickaxe to get past the ice to the dry, dusty soil of her potato patch.

She\u2019d always figured that the water pressure in the city was extreme and wasteful, and that the city people were deliberately rubbing their aquatic wealth in normal people\u2019s faces. In her mind, that would be just like them. She didn\u2019t think about that right then. Her loneliness had become as big, epic, and remorseless as the land she lived in. It just went on and on, didn\u2019t end, and didn\u2019t leave any time for thinking about the sorts of frivolous people who lived in sophisticated places like Lovelock.

A simple mining operation led to an unprecedented discovery: the Infinity Stone, a stone with an impossible number of facets, emanating an intense inner glow and inscribed in an unknown language. This beautiful, alien object changed everything, for it was a window to other realities, allowing glimpses of what might be or could have been. Years of exhausting--and sometimes disastrous--experimentation culminated in a discovery beyond imagination: the stone opened a portal to a mystical world teeming with life, full of clean air and azure skies. In this world, our fantasies were reality. Legendary creatures roamed the land and sky while elves, dwarves, and orcs inhabited the land in place of humans.\nIt is in man\u2019s nature to explore the unknown, to know what lies beyond, and so blindly humanity plunged...\nWelcome to the world of Emergence.\nConcept art by James Krause- Khal, full orc mage with runescribing, a cybernetic hand, and a bad attitude\nOn Kython, multiple genres intermingle to create a world that is exciting, fresh, and yet strikingly familiar. Sections of Kython are nearly indistinguishable from the world in which we live. There are cars, houses, trains, cell phones, and even the internet. This creates a comfortable starting point to begin your explorations on this foreign planet. However, within this unassuming framework exist all of the elements of science fiction and fantasy that make those genres exciting. Magic, power armor, and advanced weaponry fill the world with new possibilities around every corner.\nAs you venture into the world of Kython, the line quickly blurs between science fiction and fantasy. Castles, wooded fortresses, skyscrapers, and industrial complexes cover the landscape, while smartphones, cybernetics, and flying beasts are part of everyday life. The world of Kython boasts a rich diversity of settings to satisfy nearly any game style preference. Whether you prefer gunfights while blasting down the highway at 100 mph, fighting demons in a corrupted ruin, battling savage hordes to defend a village, or storming a skyscraper fortress to defeat an evil necromancer, all of these adventures and more are waiting for you. On Kython, these traditionally separate game styles come together in a way that is exciting, intuitive, and fun. The only limit is your imagination.\nFind additional information about the world of Emergence, including a history of the world, on the playemergence website.\nConcept art by James Krause- Among the most technologically advanced characters in Emergence, Codename: Vixen is an assassin equipped with advanced power armor, a collapsing a war scythe, and a heavily customized submachine gun.\nBe sure to visit our UPDATES page, where we highlight the newest additions to our Kickstarter!\nWant your hands on some awesome Emergence artwork FAST?

Future beta test packets will include a variety of additions to November\u2019s release, such as rules updates and expansions, art and fiction previews, and additional adventures.  (Not every packet will include all types of updates.)  Once you have the packet, we greatly appreciate your feedback to help us make Emergence the best pen and paper RPG on the market.\nWhat do YOU want to play?\nEmergence uses a classless, point-buy, skill-based character creation system.  However, unlike a lot of games with similar formats where your character can quickly become a bland collection of numbers for your skills and weapon damage, Emergence uses a tiered talent system to help you further define your character and make it unique and fun to play.\nSelecting from hundreds of available talents, you will construct a robust set of abilities for your character to use.  Think of talents as your class, spell lists, and feats all rolled into one.  Through these selections, you will create exactly the character you want to play.\nHere are a few other examples of talents you might take:\nWithering Suppression (Automatics, Tier 3): When you use suppressing fire on an area that contains terrain features that provide cover, at the conclusion of the suppression you may choose to permanently reduce the grade of that cover by -1/-1.  Multiple uses of this talent on the same terrain feature will stack.\nNeck Snap (Wrestling, Tier 5): You gain access to the Neck Snap wrestling maneuver. Neck Snap (-20 Stamina): Overpower a vulnerable opponent, causing 3x normal damage. If the opponent is knocked unconscious by the damage, the opponent dies instantly.\nMana Shield (Enchantment, Tier 3): You gain access to the Mana Shield spell. Mana Shield (-12 Stamina): Range personal; reaction cast.  When hit by an attack, make a conjuration effect check.  Increase all defenses by the amount listed in the Effect Result Chart until the end of your next turn.\nBrute Strike (Savagery, Tier 2): You gain access to the Brute Strike maneuver.  Brute Strike (-8 Stamina): Combat action. Make a melee attack.  On a hit, re-roll all 1s on your damage roll. You may continue to re-roll each die until there are no more 1s.  If your weapon is vicious, you may also re-roll a number of 2s up to the weapon\u2019s vicious property rating.\nFor those of you a little less interested in full-feature customization, Emergence will also let you choose from a large array of templates designed to get you into the action faster.\nEmergence uses a dynamic race system.  The humanoid races that inhabit the world are alternate evolutions of the Human, such as Elves, Orcs, Dwarves, and of course, from Earth, Humans themselves.  All races are capable of breeding with each other, and over time they have done so.  This means that you, as a player, can select from pools of racial traits that allow you to create exactly the race you want to play, be it a \u00bc orc \u00be elf, \u00bd dwarf \u00bd human, and so on.  Remember, the character abilities are also dynamic, so you have the ability in Emergence to create a character that has never been played before or mimic one of your favorite characters from another role playing game.\nConcept art by Heidi Schwartz- Eva Shaw, 1/4 dwarf 3/4 elf jack of all trades equipped with a variety of tools, hunting equipment & her trusty sidearm. Grella Morien, 1/2 elf 1/2 orc classically trained knight equipped with enchanted shield, sword & armor\nEmergence boasts an assortment of ways to permanently and temporarily augment your characters and NPCs.  Augmentations in Emergence take a number of forms, offering something for every type of character.\nOne of our design goals from the beginning has been to avoid creating a game where you are defined by your augmentations or where the goal is to acquire as many items as possible.  Every augmentation you apply to your character has a cost.  This cost has an actual effect on every character in the game, which means that more equipment and augmentation does not automatically make a character better. The goal is to allow players to use augmentations as another way to customize their characters without skewing the balance of the game toward the characters who have the best gear.\n\nCybernetics:  Most forms of cybernetics in Emergence take the form of powered prostheses.  They are most commonly used to enhance strength, increase durability, replace lost limbs, or install weapons.\nRunescribing: Magical runes carved into the flesh.  Usually runescribing is used to augment spellcasting, but the runes can have other uses as well.\nEnchanted Items: Taking the form of everything from boots to bracelets, enchanted items impart a wide variety of effects on the wearer.  They have the advantage (and disadvantage) of being removable when the situation requires, providing a great deal of versatility.\nArcane Tattoos:  These tattoos sit dormant until they are activated.  When they activate, they literally burn themselves off of the user\u2019s body throughout the duration of whatever effect they create.  Like enchanted items, arcane tattoos have a diverse selection of abilities.  The are popular for being cheap and nearly undetectable to casual observation, but they have the disadvantage of being single use.\nFleshcrafting: Ritualistic scarification, used most often by orc Fleshweavers.  When activated, they twist bestial features into the user to increase the physical prowess of the recipient, often to the detriment of their mental acuity.\nEmergence uses a customizable equipment system that allows for incredible versatility.  All equipment, including armor, weapons, and vehicles, come with a variety of base models and a large array of modifications from which to choose.  Using this system, players and GMs can create literally thousands of different pieces of equipment, making sure characters and NPCs are equipped with exactly the gear they want.\nConcept art by James Krause- Dylania, traditional elven scout with great bow and enchanted great sword\nThe world of Emergence is filled with a wide assortment of gear.  You can find and build more traditional fantasy items (magic swords and armor, enchanted boots and cloaks, etc.) as well as modern devices like explosives, assault rifles, energy weapons, and power armor. These normally disparate elements exist side by side because the more modern, technologically advanced equipment was only introduced 100 years ago, when humans came through the Infinity Stone.  Coupled with the extraordinary performance of this world\u2019s magical enchantments, this means that your classical fantasy equipment is equally as effective as your modern technology..\nThe reason that the most advanced, futuristic technological equipment in Emergence exists is simple: the Magecell.  The Magecell is a device that was created approximately twenty years ago.  It is a blend of technology and magic, storing concentrated magical energy and converting it to electricity.\nConcept art by Dusty Crosley- This Magecell is about the size of a pint glass. It is capable of powering a high energy weapon or suit of powered armor.\nEssentially a magical battery, the Magecell creates a stable, portable, moderately high output, long lasting power source.  Since its creation, the Magecell has rapidly worked its way into all manner of devices.  Magecells come in a wide array of sizes, from the size of a pack of gum to as large as a motorcycle.\nThey power everything from vehicles to buildings, personal electronics to cybernetic prostheses. In the twenty years since their invention, Magecells have made possible advancements in technology that far outpace what would have been possible by science alone.\nConcept art by Dusty Crosley- A variety of different Magecells\nWhile the invention of the Magecell has made certain technological advancements possible, they are very expensive and therefore still rare.  Standard technological equipment is still very dominant as it is significantly cheaper, more accessible, and reliable.\nIn the world of Emergence, you will be able to equip a single character with a variety of equipment from a wide range of genres.  In addition to the large array of equipment types, you can completely customize each individual piece of equipment by filling its available slots with an extensive assortment of modifications.\nWhen the time came to roll the dice, we decided to create a system that was unique and versatile, like the game itself. We are proud to introduce the Tri-Die System. Three six-sided dice are used for all rolls made in the game.\nThe Tri-Die system is the core mechanic for the Emergence roleplaying game.  In the Tri-Die system, all checks are made by rolling 3D6 (three six-sided dice). The reason we decided to use three dice instead of a single die is twofold.\nFirst, the probability of results when using three dice follows a bell curve. Thus, while very high and very low rolls are possible, they are far less likely to occur than a roll somewhere near the middle of the range. The random element of the roll is more predictable, which in turn inspires confidence when making character choices without removing the possibility for unexpected failure or longshot success.\nSecond, because we are using multiple dice for each check, we can attach additional game mechanics to the result of each of the six-sided dice in the roll. This mechanic opens many options for interesting effects related to all types of rolls. Examining the results of the individual dice is also how we created our multiple stage critical success and fumble system.\nIn our crit and fumble system, 1s are fumbles and 6s are critical successes (\u201ccrits\u201d). To determine whether or not your roll has resulted in a crit or fumble, look at the results of each die in the roll and compare the number of 1s to the number of 6s. If the total number of 1s is greater than the total number of 6s (or vice versa), the result is a fumble (or crit). For instance, if I rolled two 1s and a single 6 on my 3D6 roll, I would have a stage 1 fumble, because one of the 1s and one of the 6s would cancel each other out, leaving a net of one 1.  Stage 1 crits and fumbles usually amount to minor adjustments to damage or (in)conveniences with whatever task you were attempting, while the higher\u2013and much less likely\u2013stages have far more significant effects.\nOur crit and fumble system is just one of many examples of using single-die-specific mechanics.  This idea turns every roll into an opportunity for excitement.  It is not just the total that matters; every die has the chance to affect the outcome of whatever the character is attempting.\nThank you for your support!\nWe look forward to bringing this game to life with you!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe need to continue to test, refine, and format our ruleset.

We say that there is a large audience of PC gamers that want sophisticated games built for their platform. And inside this audience, a significant group of people that have always loved space games, and if given a quality one again will be happy to play it.\nAsk not what your genre can do for you, but what you can do for your favorite genre.\nLet's put high-end PC gaming and Space Sims back on the map!\nStar Citizen brings the visceral action of piloting interstellar craft through combat and exploration to a new generation of gamers at a level of fidelity never before seen. At its core Star Citizen is a destination, not a one-off story. It's a complete universe where any number of adventures can take place, allowing players to decide their own game experience. Pick up jobs as a smuggler, pirate, merchant, bounty hunter, or enlist as a pilot, protecting the borders from outside threats. Chris Roberts has always wanted to create one cohesive universe that encompasses everything that made Wing Commander and Privateer / Freelancer special. A huge sandbox with a complex and deep lore allowing players to explore or play in whatever capacity they wish. That universe is Star Citizen.\nThe Reasons You'll Want to Play Star Citizen\n A huge universe to explore, trade and adventure in\nSpace is unending, endless and so are your opportunities. Strike out to make your fortune amongst the Stars or sign-up for a tour of duty in the UEE Fleet.\nConstantly expanding and evolving universe\nWe\u2019re committed to making Star Citizen a living, breathing universe that is its own entity. It will be a constantly shifting and evolving place for players to explore and affect.\nMicro updates rule!\nWe\u2019re not interested in having yearly updates. Once live, we will have a team of people adding content on a weekly or bi-weekly basis. So we\u2019ll always be adding data, stories and campaigns as well as reacting to the needs and actions of the players.\nSquadron 42 - A Wing Commander style single player mode, playable OFFLINE if you want\nPlayable offline or online, co-op with friends, you sign up for a tour of duty with the UEE fleet, manning the front lines, protecting settlements from Vanduul warbands.\nLife during wartime\nIf you distinguish yourself in combat, you might be invited to join the legendary 42nd Squadron. Much like the French Foreign Legion of old, they can always be found in the toughest areas of operation and always snatch victory from the jaws of defeat, regardless of the odds.\nThe conflict never ends\nUpon completion of your tour you\u2019ll re-enter the persistent Star Citizen universe with some credits in your pocket and Citizenship to help you make your way.  But in the universe of Star Citizen when one conflict ends, another is just around the corner.  You\u2019ll have opportunity to spend more time with your squadron mates as additional Campaigns are released as part of the content update plan.\nActions of the players impact the universe and become part of its history and lore\nThe universe will change based on the players' actions and adventures allowing them to become part of the history of the universe. As an example, players can scan for gravitational anomalies while out in space. If one is discovered and the player manages to successfully navigate this uncharted jump point, they\u2019ll be able to sell their Nav- Computers recording of their jump flight path for a great profit to a space company for other users to download. But the real prize is getting the system or jump-point named after them!\nAllowing user generated content is a key design goal\nOur modding tools will allow players to design new ships for both submission to the persistent RSI ship dealer network or to build custom ships and items for the self-hosted multiplayer mode.\nIt\u2019s about the gameplay and your interactions with others\nWe plan to put a lot of social ideas in the universe. Since the universe is dynamic, it will create some divisions and factions. For example, it\u2019s a perfectly valid choice not to be a Citizen and operate outside the protection of Earth. We think there will be people that gravitate to crime or helping enforce the law or defending the galaxy from the alien raiders or just accumulating as much money as possible. We want to include all these social divisions so players will gravitate to one or the other much like the real world operates. \nFully dynamic economy driven by player actions\nIf too many people fly iron ore to the smelting plants of New Pittsburgh, steel prices will drop. Buy low\u2026 sell high\u2026 you hope.\nThe cost of society\nIn game trade landing and trade tariffs pay for law and order in the civilized systems. Want to make a bigger profit? Try the outer world - outside earth\u2019s infrastructure and protection. The downside? No military or local police to protect you from an opportunistic pirate!\nMoney isn\u2019t everything\nYou could be a trader, a miner or an industrial magnate. Amass great wealth or just run enough missions to earn a comfortable living and upgrades for your ship.\nSpace is empty but you\u2019re never really alone\nIf caught alone in an online ambush, send a distress broadcast to your friends and if they\u2019re nearby they can jump in-system to save your bacon. In each combat instance player slots are reserved for your friends so you can rally forces to join you in combat!\nBigger ships offer bigger multi-player action\nOn larger ships, friends can join you to man turrets, repair systems, or switch with you on the pilot\u2019s chair. Think the Millennium Falcon with Han-Solo piloting and Luke on the turret.\nFull rigid body simulation of all spaceships\nYou wanted proper Newtonian mechanics. You got it! Spaceships adjust their trajectory and orientation just like the real thing.\nIntelligent Flight Control System (IFCS)\nLike a modern day F-35, the ships have fly by wire systems which take the player\u2019s inputs and then translate them into the commands for the ship\u2019s engine and thrusters to articulate and deliver the required thrust to achieve the pilot\u2019s request.\nDynamic Ship Maneuverability\nShip\u2019s performance is calculated dynamically based on various physical variables and the ability of your jet maneuvering to deliver thrust towards a requested vector. What does this mean? Infinite customization with component damage, mass or energy changes affecting maneuverability on the fly \u2013 allowing for endless combat strategies and results.\nShip Components matter!\nBecause we are fully simulating the physics and flight dynamics, the actual components matter. If a port thruster is damaged, it will affect your maneuverability organically.  If you upgrade your thruster package with enhanced thrusters that gimbal faster and deliver more thrust it will affect your performance. Dump cargo, you may be able to get the edge in turning in a dogfight.\n10X the detail of current AAA games\nMost current gen \u201cAAA\u201d games have around 10,000 polygons for a character and 30,000 or so for a vehicle. In Star Citizen, the characters are detailed at 100,000 polygons, the fighter at 300,000 and the Space Carrier 7 million! This allows unparalleled detail, making the visuals more immersive than has ever been achieved before.\nEverything you would imagine would move or articulate on a spaceship or a device \u2013 does!\nEvery spaceship is built from 100s of sub-components, many of them moving and articulating just like they would in the \u201creal\u201d world. If a component gets damaged during combat be prepared to feel the effects on your ship.\nRange of scale never seen before in a game\nFrom a vast 1km long carrier to a 27m fighter, to your 1.8m tall pilot, Everything is rendered and to the same level of detail. Zoom in to the paneling of the carrier and its texel density is the same as the 27m fighter. All without a load screen or loss of visual fidelity.\nReally feel the scale of ships and space battles\nBecause of the ability of the game to scale seamlessly you could be looking out the windows on the bridge of a carrier watching the battle unfold or jump into a cockpit and take the fight to the enemy.\nJoystick, gamepad, mouse, keyboard are all supported.\nWe\u2019ve all got our preferences, so why be forced to choose?\nAdvanced peripheral support\nAs part of commitment to high end gaming we are dedicated to supporting the more exotic enthusiast peripherals; HOTAS, flight chair, rudder pedals. It\u2019s all about the immersion and if you've got the equipment we want to support it!\nVirtual Reality is here!\nWe have backed Oculus Rift and will support it in Star Citizen / Squadron 42. Who doesn't want to sit in their cockpit, hands on your joystick and throttle, swiveling your head, to track that enemy fighter that just blew by?\nNext generation, TODAY\nBuilt on top of Crytek\u2019s award winning CryEngine3 technology, Star Citizen\u2019s engine is built to scale for the PC\u2019s of today and tomorrow.\nA PC gaming enthusiast\u2019s friend!\nAs you upgrade your PC, Star Citizen will take advantage of your extra processor cores, memory or GPUs. This is why you\u2019re a PC gamer \u2013 you love being on the cutting edge, not stuck in the past!\nToday\u2019s game publishers, like their Hollywood counterparts, want predictable returns from sequels to last year\u2019s hits. A game in an out- of-favor genre, set in an original universe is viewed as a bad investment. And the concept of developing a new product exclusively for the PC sends publishing executives and most Venture Capitalists running for the exits.\nAnd that hero is you, the unappreciated PC gamer. The ignored Space Sim fan.\nThis is your chance to have your voice heard. To tell the world that high end PC gaming lives. That you want to sit in the cockpit of your space fighter defending the galaxy or making your fortune as a wily entrepreneur.\nStar Citizen is meant to be everything you ever dreamed you could have in a Space-Sim, all in one glorious ever-evolving package.\nWe know it may not look like this, but we do!\nWhat you've seen was put together by a very small team over the past year. We felt that this vision needed to be shown rather than talked about so we invested our own money to build the technical and visual prototype that shows just how Star Citizen is going to push the limits of PC games.\nInstead of taking this prototype to a publisher for a green light, we are cutting out the middleman and taking it to you.\nYou as the customer get the ultimate vote in whether we make this game. Your dollars are your votes and the better we do the more resources we\u2019ll have to bring you a great game.\nWe have investors that have agreed to contribute the balance we need to complete this game as long as we can validate that there is a demand for a high end PC space game. By meeting or surpassing our target on Kickstarter you tell the world that you want a PC based Space Sim and allow us to make this game.\nBut we're offering more than just the chance to support the platform and genre.\nAs an early backer, you\u2019ll also be getting a lot more than just the finished game.\nFor the people who pledge for their spaceship in the Star Citizen universe, you\u2019ll be part of a select club that has exclusive access to early gameplay and behind the scenes development updates.\nThe people who pledge for their spaceships will get to test-fly them long before the general public. 12 months in, we will allow the early backers to play the multiplayer space combat Alpha, and then 20-22 months in they will get to play the Star Citizen Beta, adventuring around the huge open galaxy, well before the general public. We are going to limit our alpha slots to 200,000 as we want to stress test the game with real users, but will not be ready for the full load until we have finished Beta.\nIn addition, part of the money we are asking for is budgeted to maintain the Roberts Space Industries site with constant updates. Our goal is for the game\u2019s website to be live from day one, constantly giving information about what\u2019s happening in the galaxy even before the game is live, sharing interesting insights into the development process and canvassing the early backers for their opinions. Roberts Space Industries should be the first stop into the Star Citizen universe. When we say we want to involve the community, we really mean it!\nFinally we are offering the pledge slots a discount to what the final digital price will be. Like Guild Wars 2, the basic game will be $60, but for the very early backers we are offering the entry tier at $30. But hurry! Slots are limited!\nOur hope is that these benefits are compelling enough for you to pledge for your spaceship today.\nPlease support us, tell your friends and participate in the discussion.

But I also think you backed Star Citizen because you wanted to say something to the business and marketing machines that normally decide which games are made. You said they are not the taste makers for you, that you want your voice heard on what kind of game you play and you want to have a greater involvement and connection to the development of that game."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #55", "update_userinfo": "Kickstarter Account Linking Status", "update_content": "Greetings Citizens!
