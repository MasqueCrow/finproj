the Kickstarter RPG magazine initiative. According to the rules, our project is in black and white and will be a saddle-stitched A5 booklet.\nI wanted to make the easiest-to-play TTRPG ever. It had to have some mechanics, it had to inspire awesome adventures, and... it had to have zero math, no dice, and just be a blast to play regardless of the player's TTRPG experience. (No easy feat let me tell you).\n\nI also needed a setting that was both cinematic and action-packed... Bounty Hunters in space.\n\nSo I proudly present to you for your backing: Bounty Hunter - a cinematic, slick, and easy-to-play TTRPG.\n\n\"The PCs are Bounty Hunters taking on jobs, hunting down bounties, claiming the rewards and living large in a galaxy full of wonders and chaos. \"\nRetro-styled, easy to use, and printed on recycled paper\nIf you've ever wanted to run a cool game set in space with super simple rules -and you wanted to run it now - this is the game system for you.\nIn this 32 page A5 rulebook we've packed in:\nAll the rules needed to run the game\n  Character creation and Backstory Generator\n  96 Bounty Hunter random names generator\n  Starship Combat\n  5 sample starships\n  5 sample NPCs\n  Epic bounty hunter equipment\n   The rules are designed in such a way that this Bounty Hunter TTRPG can be played with ZERO BOUNTY HUNTERS and is also an awesome Sci-Fi TTRPG system. Wanna run Galaxy Journey? Galaxy Conflicts? Warsun Universia? A large open space that expands for a long way? It's all here. \n\nThis is the color version of the booklet. Many folks seem to prefer the color option, so here it is! This is still subject to change if we get funded.\nThe rules are simple. So simple in fact the system was originally called \"Yes/No\" as that was the only mechanic. Can you fly a ship? Yes or no? Do you dodge the mouth of that massive Keel Wyrm as it tries to eat you and your ship? Yes or no? I wanted nothing to stand in the way of a great adventure and an awesome gaming session.\nAfter playtesting my rules set, refining it, and bashing it about, Bounty Hunter is the end result and ticks all the boxes: No math, no dice, all fun.\nA Carbithian captain could not outrun QW1CK-K1LL.\nCharacter Creation is a breeze. Seven unique alien races, dozens of career paths, histories, and momentous life changing events shape your character. In fact, once character creation is done - you have a full blown character backstory ready for the GM to use and abuse. That's how complete this system is.\nCharacter creation is fast and easily guides your characters backstory as you make it.\nNew players will enjoy the fact that within 10 minutes they are up and running with a cool character chasing bounties, fighting monsters and flying spaceships.\nYou end up with a cool Bounty Hunter and a great backstory. Your GM ends up with several solid plot hooks and a PC with a backstory!\nThere are a few more steps than just these five presented here. I wanted players to experience the power of a good backstory, without becoming overwhelmed and either not creating anything, or writing a novel. The system helps you write a concise yet solid narrative of just who your character is and how they came to be a Bounty Hunter.\nThe Combat system is - like everything else in the game - straight forward and quick. Space combat - ship versus ship - is super simple yet verbally dramatic. Each character sheet, monster, and starship comes with all the rules pertaining to how they work on their sheets. You don't need to remember or learn anything. It is all right there!\n\n\"Cinematic TTRPG\" was another title that we considered; which seemed apt since the very essence of this game is about vivid descriptions, awesome actions and kick-ass heroes... or anti-heroes!\nCombat is all about the drama, the fun, and all the PCs having a role aboard their own starships\n The settings booklet will feature a galactic map and dozens of planets, peoples, places, and ships for you to use in your game! \nI'll make a starmap like this one (one of my other campaign settings) and will fill it with fun things for your PCs to explore and do!\nWe have unlocked our third stretch goal! A second booklet will now ship with the main booklet. The second booklet will feature an introductory adventure for Bounty Hunters TTRPG! \n\nThe main booklet will now include a variety of extra starships for your bounty hunters to command, attack, and board! We will also include additional Monsters and NPCs, primed and ready for use! \n\nNext goal: My First Bounty - a Bounty hunter introductory Adventure written by me for you to use! \nA small job! A small job!\n I'd also write up an adventure that would be added to the booklet. Finally, The Campaign Setting would feature a map of the galaxy and a write up of all the major aliens and places needed for a full campaign.\nI've designed rule systems for 5th Edition, rule systems for dozens of homebrew systems for decades, and rule systems for fun. None of them are so intuitive and dramatic as this rules set. My partner - a total TTRPG noobie (literally 1 game of 5th ed under his belt) - challenged me to make a system without math or dice (random number generator). I initially said it couldn't be done.\n\nThen I realized... it could be. With a little inspiration, several dozen hours of playtesting basic mechanics, a couple hundred hours of tweaks, and bingo: Bounty Hunter the TTRPG was born.\n\nI love sci-fi as a setting, and I've always been frustrated with traditional TTRPGs that force great roleplaying off the table in favor of random outcomes. This system is not my first attempt to marry these two concepts together, but this is the best one I've created thus far and I'm proud to play this game and explore this space, and I hope that you and your players will be equally entertained. Let your story begin...\n\n\"In a cantina at the edge of space sits a nervous Fulkathian engineer. Sweat pools on his brow. He knows he is being hunted. And hunted by the best.\nYou walk into that cantina, you know the target is here because you are the best. You are Bounty Hunter.\"\nKeel Wyrms can get big... really big... Oh and they fly through space. Did I mention that?\nSo why do we need to kickstart? We want to bring in a professional designer for the layout, editor to make sure it makes sense, and have more artwork made to flesh this puppy out. Join us and together we can rule... I mean collect ALL the bounties!\nWe are proud to be part of Zine Quest 3", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nVery few risks exist. The rules have been written, the game tested.

Although brave and determined, adventurers are only human! They are prone to the madness and pain the twisted dwellers of the dungeons will inflict upon them. Death can occur, but is not the worst fate: heroes can be driven mad and beyond help!\nPlease note minis come unpainted.\nThe game is played in campaigns of 11 missions. To reach the Darkest Dungeon itself, players will undertake 3 missions per threat level and vanquish the boss. Then, they will be strong enough to face the horrors of the Darkest Dungeon! They may emerge victorious... if they dispatch the source of evil that plagues the land.\nPlease note minis come unpainted.\nFor each hero, select 3 skills out of 7 before heading into your mission (and level the heroes up to gain access to more skills). In each room, pick the most suitable stance to best resolve the conflict! Then, on each turn, a player chooses two of the available actions of moving, interacting with the environment, changing their stance or using a skill (if eligible for their current stance). Triumph over encounters, resist rampant madness and emerge victorious before throwing yourself into another battle. Between missions, spend your time in the hamlet, visiting various buildings to find relief from the physical and mental trauma you\u2019ve just endured. Restore the hamlet to its former glory and it will reward you and help you to fulfill the ultimate goal.\nRPG-like heroes  \u2013 A robust level up system with a ton of customization for unique playable characters.\nStressful Affliction System \u2013 Heroes' personalities are paramount!

Backers from these countries will not pay import taxes.\nShipping is not charged as part of this Kickstarter campaign but is instead done so on the pledge manager after the campaign ends. The shipping price you will pay is based on the weight of your pledge and the country to which it is to be shipped.\nThe above is a list of rough estimates for shipping. These estimates are based on the costs for our previous campaigns and an estimated final weight of the Core pledge at 5kg. Keep in mind that adding optional buys or additional pledge levels will raise the weight of your pledge and may also then raise the final shipping price.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nGeneral\n\nThis is our tenth Kickstarter and we\u2019ve learned a lot from our previous nine. Producing thousands of products and coordinating their delivery to homes across the planet is a complex business, and there are many things which could go wrong. This is why we build in as much time for the unforeseen as possible. We want to ensure that we have the space to deal with any unexpected setbacks and still get your game to you before the estimated delivery date.\n\nTo give you a frame of reference for exactly when you will get your game, Mythic Battles: Pantheon, Time of Legends: Joan of Arc season 1 and Reichbusters: Projekt Vril have been delivered. Super Fantasy Brawl is going to complete fulfillment by the end of the month. Solomon Kane, a big scope project, is at the printer and will be delivered in two waves. In specific wave 1 is in mass production now and the wave 2 moulds are also now being produced. Time of Legends: Joan of Arc season 1.5 is on track and the first elements will be soon sent to production. Enchanters: East Quest has been printed and is going to ship this month. Steamwatchers is on track and will go to production soon, to make the March fulfilment. HEL: The Last Saga is currently in development.\n\nFor all our games, we communicate with our backers with regular updates on Kickstarter and on Gamefound (for our late pledgers) You can also find us on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Discord, learn our news and project updates through our weekly Newscast and ask all your questions in our Q&A with Leo on YouTube every Wednesday evening.\n\nPlease note that the components, component counts, quality and rules, are all work in progress and subject to change.\n\nDelivery\n\nOur experience in our previous KS has shown us that there can be variances in terms of timing and remaining in schedule when it comes to anything produced in China, such as:\nProduction delays\nShipping delays\nCustoms delays\nAt the same time there are also the unpredictable factors; recently it was the Coronavirus outbreak, but there can be others such as weather conditions, strikes and others.\nThe estimated delivery date for this project is October 2021, but please bear in mind this is only an estimate. Also, due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others.\n\nShipping\n\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look, materials, and content of the rewards (and the project) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented in this Kickstarter project.\nIf you do not finalise your pledge and pay for shipping by the closing date of the pledge manager, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received. However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your pledge if you contact us and confirm your pledge after the pledge manager has closed.\nIf you confirm your pledge by the closing date of the pledge manager, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and that outside of countries specifically listed as being \u201cfriendly\u201d (above) you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods. We regret we are unable to ship to PO Boxes or APO addresses.\nAll backers that have selected \u201cNo Reward\u201d on Kickstarter, that wish to receive a reward for this campaign, must make sure to confirm their order by the Pledge Manager Deadline. We will announce the date for this once the Pledge Manager becomes live. All \u201cNo Reward\u201d pledges will be treated as donations once the Pledge Manager Deadline has passed.\n\nKSE\n\nAs KSE, or Kickstarter Exclusives, are marked the products that will not be available to retail. Mythic Games retains the right to continue to sell those in the Pledge Manager, the Mythic Games website, as well as conventions.\n\nRefunds\n\nWe have a no-questions-asked refund policy.\nAll pledges can be refunded in full up to 14 days after the end of the Kickstarter campaign. In addition, if any part of your order cannot be delivered, then we will reimburse you the full cost of this component regardless of the date.\nIf you apply for a refund more than 14 days after the end of the Kickstarter then we will only be able to refund 85% of it. The difference is the amount of the unrecoverable fees paid to process your order.\nOnce we have started to process and pack your order, refunds will no longer be available.\nRefunds within the first 14 days are reversed via Stripe to the credit card you used to pledge originally. Any refunds requested after the 14 day period may be processed via PayPal or reversed via Stripe or your credit card.
