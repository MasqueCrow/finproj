That's right, MetaWear is made in the USA!\n\nOf course, there are still risks associated with producing the Metawear board. Unexpected changes in component lead times, availability, and cost are examples of factors outside our direct control that could affect our delivery timeline, but we are working hard to mitigate those risks and plan to be transparent throughout the delivery process.\n\nThe other risk with this and any other project that involves physical delivery comes with shipping. There are a number of unforeseen circumstances that can cause problems during the actual physical shipping of the Metawear boards. We plan to work with proven companies to help ensure that our boards arrive (in perfect condition) at their delivery destination. Since unforeseen circumstances can sometimes impact the shipping world, we will also make sure to have methods/resources in place to overcome any difficulties.\n\nPlease note that the final look and features of the MetaWear are subject to change based on your feedback and circumstances outside of our control such as component availability.\n\nAs always we expect our backers, supporters, and MetaWear users to comply with the proper regulations and laws of their country of residence.

One thing was for sure, the rainy streets of England and dull dreary colours were a far cry from the crazy ski lifestyle. So I decided to create something special, something the world needs and put some zest back into the streets. \nI created Bryt, thats 'bright', and we're aiming to become the first colour only clothing company. Its the first of its kind. Right now our aim is to make the brightest most colourful socks, engineered to make you smile using some crazy colours and patterns. I like crazy, you should too!\nI teamed up with my partner Natalie. She's the design geek and a little crazy too! She comes from a long line of creators and designers. Together we're starting one hell of a journey. We created the most insane collection of socks you'll find anywhere, so enjoy! \nWhichever socks you choose, you are guaranteed to have the brightest socks and the biggest smile!\nWe are not restricting your choice of design like some other campaigns. No fixed packs. We are giving you the choice you deserve. Choose from any design in any size.\nThe choice is yours\nWe surveyed 568 people and these 9 designs represent the best. The brightest socks with the most sole!\nHave you ever caught yourself wearing dull colours? Greys and blacks. Colours that make you blend into the background? Have you ever felt one of many? Blending into the crowd? We did, and we know we weren't alone.  \nWe thought about an item that most of us wear everyday. An item that can be used to stand out or just hint a little va va voom. We instantly knew the solution was socks. What if you pull on a Bryt sock and you felt alive, like an individual, in control, and a little crazy? We landed on the Bryt sock.  \nBryt\u2019s starting off super simple 9 designs and 9 designs only - to make your choice easy!\nWe found a special Combed Cotton that permits a super fine yarn that not only feels great, but keeps hold of colour better than any other. So your socks stay super bright. Yehaa!\nOur in house scientist discovered this tech, you can see how he got to this discovery below (he's a bit of a character too).\nPLAY\n\nOur socks use the best combed cotton. Long narrow fibres from the Turkish Aegean region offer the best thread count and a super soft yarn.\nBryt is making all its designs in two sizes. A small and large size. So, girl or guy, whatever your taste, you are covered. Don't worry about ordering the correct size when you pledge. We will send a survey once the campaign is finished to collect your size and design choice(s). Remember you can mix between both sizes! We have tested the smaller size with the little critters and they fit children 7+ years old.\nWe have chosen a small family owned business in Great Britain to oversee our production. Production in the UK is more costly compared to imported products from Asia. However, British garment makers receive some of the highest working conditions in the world and we feel you deserve the best and true British craftsmanship in your sock drawer. Something we are really proud of.\nEven our packaging is made in Great Britain\nNOTE TO BACKERS AROUND THE WORLD\nBryt is aiming to be a global campaign. We are supporting shipments across the globe and invite everyone to grab a pair of socks.\nBryt has one aim. Craft bright colourful socks that make you smile. But thats not all. Bryt wants to become the first colour only clothing company! Thats neat! We want to create a company that stands for happiness, self confidence and give you the wearer a lift - not just with your sock drawer.\nBryt socks are ready and waiting to go into production. With your help we can make our first production run. Join us on our colourful quest to create a happier, brighter world, feet first. Please back our Kickstarter project and in return we will send you our incredible socks.\nBacking our campaign is super simple:\nFind your reward at the top right of the page.\nHover over the reward and click 'select this reward'. \nWhen you are happy with your choice click 'continue to next step'. \nFill out your payment details - sit back and smile.\nIt really is that simple.

Are you?\n \nCompare HYDAWAY to other types of water bottles\n\n\n\nBUSY LIVES CALL FOR CONVENIENCE\nAs a husband, father of two kids, and an outdoor enthusiast, I am always on the go. My job as a product designer requires me to travel frequently, meeting clients all over the globe.\nLike many of you, I do my best to live a healthy lifestyle and a large part of health is proper hydration. I am also committed to minimizing the impact my family makes on the planet, and strive to set a positive example for my children.\nBut I found that without a superior alternative, resisting the temptation to buy bottled water while on-the-go was very challenging.\nWhether it\u2019s in the airport jumping between connecting flights, or taking a day trip with the kids in tow, I needed a water bottle that could fit my active lifestyle.\nALTERNATIVES TO BOTTLED WATER\nWhat are the alternatives to disposable bottled water that are eco-conscious, reusable, simple to use, convenient to carry, and easy to clean?\nMetal water bottles are sustainable since metal is recyclable, and most are labeled as BPA-free, but they are heavy, loud, and their bulkiness make them difficult to carry and pack away.\nPlastic reusable water bottles are mostly BPA-free these days, but are also bulky and inconvenient to store.\nFoldable, hand-held bladders seemed to be the most convenient alternative to the bulkiness of a bottle, but they tip over easily and when it came to cleaning them, it was an absolute nightmare.\nAs you can imagine, when I thought about \u201csuperior alternatives,\u201d none of these options seemed superior to me! \nTHE VISION\nTraveling on yet another flight home from a long business trip, I had a vision of a water bottle that was ergonomic like a traditional bottle, and would fold up to fit into my pants pocket or messenger bag. \nI knew this bottle design could be 100% BPA-free, taste and odor-free, easy to clean, and best of all, would fold up into a thin compact disc that could be stored virtually anywhere while on the go.\nMy mind was spinning with the possibilities!\nTHE BREAKTHROUGH\nAfter two years of racking my brain considering how I could help to change the way we think about disposable bottled water, I finally had an honest, fully-functional water bottle design worth sharing: The HYDAWAY. \nNow my passion in life (besides my family) is to share this product with you, and the world. Won\u2019t you please join me? \nAs a backer of this campaign, you are making a commitment to: \nDrinking more water and fewer sugary drinks to live a healthier lifestyle! \nReducing the amount of plastic we add to our landfills and oceans, by cutting down on the 50 billion disposable bottles we throw out each year!\nReducing our dependency on oil, by cutting down on the 17 million barrels of crude oil that go into making plastic bottles each year!\nTogether we can give everyone a convenient, safe, and environmentally-friendly way to drink more water!

All other orders will be processed as soon as possible after the Kickstarter orders have been sent out.\n\nLost Packages\n\n\u2022 We\u2019ve had some experience shipping products internationally, including lost packages.\n\u2022 Even if it means sending out a product three times, we are committed to make sure it gets into your hands.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"status": []}], "comment_no": 641, "projec_url": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/hydaway/hydawaytm-a-pocket-sized-water-bottle-fit-for-any", "project_name": "HYDAWAY\u2122 | A Pocket-Sized Water Bottle Fit for any Adventure"}}]
